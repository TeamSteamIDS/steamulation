												Okay, so obviously I've played this game a ridiculous amount of time.  I can be a little obsessive about getting a game going JUST RIGHT so that I can build my empire.  That having been said, I still have not explored all of the facets of the game as of yet.  Now I have not played the previous versions of this game, so I didn't really know what to expect with it, and I have to say that my girlfriend made fun of me for days after purchasing and playing this game.   Here is what makes it so awesome:You have a unique opportunity to build your own empire with the farming equipment and shifting markets.  Yes, you're running a farm.  Doesn't sound all that interesting, does it?  Well, playing it on a computer removes all of the icky-est parts of owning your own farm, and the fast settings allow you to harvest every day (about every 21 game hours, actually), which means that if you are savvy with the way you start, you can really build your business.The game allows you to pick different ways to play the game, including how much involvement you want to have in the game.  There are some crops, like wheat, barley, or canola, that require very little micromanaging on your part.  See, this game allows you two options, depending on the task you are undertaking... you can either run the machine yourself (which takes some dexterity, believe you me!) or you can hire a worker to do it for you.  I made the mistake on my first go-round of trying to run the harvester myself.  Anyway, on crops like the ones I mentioned, the only thing you really need to do is run the tractor that gets the grain from the harvester (with a trailer) and drop it off either in your silo for storage or sell it directly to the highest buyer.If you want to make more money, there are other things you can produce, such as Bio Gas.  This is what I like to call the money making machine.  I won't go into details here, since I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but do the research and you will soon have all the money you need to fund whatever your chosen task is.  The point is, that you have to spend your time and energy running the darned tractor around dumping into the buckets (this takes HOURS).  So if you want to really spend time on your game and work at it, you certainly have the opportunity to thrive.The game is beautifully crafted, and the machinery is very realistic (but what do I know, I work in an office, right?).  As other people have mentioned before, crash simulation is almost non-existant.  Frankly, that's the way I like it.  If I'm stupid enough to accidentally flip my tractor over and it somehow magically rights itself with all of its contents still in tact?  I'm a happy camper.  Again, all of the icky stuff has been removed.  The game itself though, and the two worlds that it comes with, have beautiful graphics (I'm running on the highest settings, though) and the ambient sound is realistic but repetative.  Personally I wish they would put a volume bar in that could go at increments of 5 instead of 10, but I'm being picky.To be fair, here's a list of cons for the game:This game will take over your life.  No, seriously.  If you are committed to playing this game and getting to the 5 million marker, you need to put in some serious time.  It starts SLOW.  So slow you think you're going to slit your wrists for spending your first 3 or 4 hours just to successfully figure out how to complete your harvest and reseed a new one.  You will make mistakes.  You will buy the wrong equipment.  You will want to restart your game at least 3 times.  If you buy this game and commit to it, you're going to put in at least 12 hours exploring the mechanics of the game, and still you'll learn new things about how the machinery works and you'll wish you had known 50 GAME HOURS AGO.  Ah well.  Such is life.  Keep dumping those silage buckets.As I sort of hinted at in the previous point, the tutorial is woefully lacking in information.  And the tutorial will still seem completely overwhelming.  There is SO MUCH to the game mechanics of this game to learn, and one of the biggest and most important tools is your tablet, which can be accessed using your ""i"" key.  I don't honestly remember them mentioning this in the tutorial once, and your tablet is crutial to running your farm.  It will show you where your machinery is, how far along in the harvest your crops are, how much crops are selling for, what the projected weather will be (because it really does matter!) and many other things that you will need to know.  How they could have left this out (or again, maybe I missed it) I couldn't possibly tell you.  I was looking up game guides for this and came across mention of it, and once again my game was reborn.The sun doesn't set.  Well, the sun doesn't TRAVEL, rather.  It stays in one position in the sky for the entire day and simply simulates the coloring of a sunrise and sunset by just dimming itself.  I don't know why, but this really bothers me, although I can understand why it wouldn't have been high on the game developers' priority list.  The rest of the details seem so well thought that I figured this would be a given.When the game speeds up, the machinery doesn't.  Now this may seem normal to some people, but I also have a healthy love for The Sims 4, and I'm used to having everything speed up when I speed up time.  It means that while you can speed up the harvest time of planted crops, or force the hour to turn over to see the new crop prices on your tablet, you can't make your machines work your field any darned faster than they can physically do it.  This means that you might even have time to get up and make yourself a sandwich while your cultivator and seeder work your field.  Personally, I knit while my machines are on autopilot.  But that's just another reason why this game is great for me.  Impatient people though, them not so much.There's no action to this game at all.  This really should be a given to anyone who spends more than 30 seconds looking at the specs of this game, but I'm sure that some people are displeased that this game is so tranquil.  Personally, I like it, but the game is monotonous--intentionally so.  A lot of people would find this game tedious.  It is.  I love it.  Deal with it.So as I said, I haven't yet explored every facet of this game.  I have yet to farm corn to get corn, usually I just farm for silage.  I have yet to try cutting down trees, or having cattle or sheep.  Also potatoes.  I'm not sure I'm gonna try doing potatoes.  But regardless, I have yet to be bored with this game, not enough to eventually come back again.  So far the DLC has been reasonable (although I haven't used much of the IT Runner pack at all, really) and the game has been a pleasure.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a game that they can relax into after a long day.  Do I want to be a farmer in real life?  Not a chance.  Do I enjoy playing a simulated farm game?  You bet your a$$ I do.Oh, and one more thing.  Eventually my girlfriend stopped making fun of me.JK^Just Kidding (she still totally makes fun of me)			"

												This game is destroying my life.   I just cant stop playing it.  Think this game is all about combines and cultivators?  I did.  I thought ""why would i want to play a game about farming?  that's stupid.""  I cannot accurately explain how in depth this game actually is.  Harvesting crops is only 1/3 of this game.  Hell, probably even less.  You can literally play this game and never once harvest a crop and still make millions.  Forrestry is very lucrative, even on Hard difficulty.   Silage (fermented grass/chaff) making is extremely profitable, almost game-breakingly so.   If you do like the large combines (All hail the CR 10.90) and running large farmlands, there is plenty to do with grains/root vegetables, the latter of which will consume ALL your time.  Also, there are passive ways to make money as well. You can buy objects like solar panels to generate you small profits per hour, or eventually buy wind turbines to generate much larger profits.  As well as semi-active income sources, like animals.  Chickens take zero maintenance, just collect the eggs and sell them.   Sheep require grass for food, to generate wool, and a forklift to transport the wool pallets to sell for a larger profit.  Cows take a significant larger time/effort/money investment to run at high efficiencies, but can make you lots of money.Last thing I'll say is that the mods for this game are absolutely wonderful.  Anything the devs left out has been crafted by the modding communities.  There's a mod for pretty much any application you need.  Have a trailer that can't attach to your Quad-Trac tractor you just dropped 350K on?  There's a simple mod for that!  I started typing this with the intent of making only one paragraph about it, but I am really a supporter of this game.  It's extremely well done and for the pricetag, there's not much better.  I knocked it before i tried it because farming sounds soooo boring.  I coulnd't be happier that I gave in and bought it. "

												It's all my brothers fault.  I laughed when i saw it pop up that he was playing Farming Simulator.. I mean what kind of fun could you possibly have playing on a farm.  Then I went to visit him and I tried it.  I bought it and my life has vanished.  I think I had a girlfriend once, but I can't remember.  Got to plough that field, need a BIG harvester, that'll make the game so much easier, but wait, that new Sower will cut the time I spend sowing my fields from 2 hours to 30 minutes... NEEDS it, but wait.... and so it goes.Seriously I work from home so this game is aboslutely perfect for me, I can work and plough at the same time, harvest and then get back to doing some work.  It's not like an FPS or something where I have to finish a zone before I can safely leave things and work for an hour or 2.  God bless Farming Simulator.  Don't be worried by the number of hours I've played, I've slept through some of them... I think.			"

												 The joy that this game provides is unfathomable.  I am consistently draw back to it like an ex i just can't drop, and each time I come back I'm reminded that I love it, but I just can't figure out why.  I try to tell my buddies about it, but trying to describe it in words just doesn't do it justice.  I find myself spending most of my time driving under 10 mph, staring at lines in the ground and tryin to stay within them.  It sounds ludicrous.  But right now, this is the most relaxing thing in my life and I look forward to it thorughout the day.  I find myself fanasizing about actually becoming a farmer.  Moving to the middle of no f-ing where and finding a farmers daughter to settle down with.  I want to powerwash everything.  To control nature with my two hands, and harvest it with the most rediculously oversized harvester the world has ever seen.  I might be millions in debt to the bank, but damn this tractor has so many buttons!!!  Thank you Faming Simulator 15, for bringing zen into my life.			"

												Farmer Bob walked out to his field and looked over the fresh crop.  For some reason, everything seemed a bit sharper and better looking lately.  Which made Bob happy.  But many of his favorite tools had vanished from the market, which made Bob unhappy.  Surely they would return to the market later, but he'd probably have to pay for the access.  ""The Man"" was always stickin it to Bob like that.  Because that's ""The Man""'s job.Bob looked over his combine.  It was dirty, but there was no damage to it, but that was expected.  There was never any damage.  He'd taken to jumping his tractor off cliffs and humming Dixie.  Maybe he'd get a horn set up for it.Bob's life was never exciting.  There were no aliens, commie invasions to fight off, or Godzilla vs Mothra battles in the north 40.  But that's okay.  Bob drove tractors.  He liked driving tractors and combines and loaders in giant circles and squares and quadrilaterals and stuff.  And that's what's important in life.  That, and sneaking off with the chickens' eggs to make some extra cash.  It helped that he'd clubbed that dang rooster over the head every time he heard it.  It finally seemed to shut up, or at least turn the volume down.The south field was already planted, so Bob hopped into yet another tractor and hooked up a sprayer.  Setting the brand spankin new cruise control to its only value - cruise, he activated the spray and drove his first pass over the field.  Coming to the end of the field, he shut off the sprayer.  The cruise control immediately sensed the shutoff and floored the accelerator.  Bob whipped the tractor around as fast as he could and the cruise slowed a bit through the turn.  But when he straightened out, the cruise shifted into warp 7.  The inertial dampeners failed and Bob was crushed against the back seat of his machine, accelerating out of control.  As his ribs cracked and he lost consciousness, his last thoughts were of how poorly the English language could express his dislike of the new cruise control.  At least the tractor wouldn't be damaged. "

												What can be said about Farming Simulator 15 other than hell yeah?  Seriously it is like, the game was already awesome. And then they sprayed some awesome fertilizer on it and increased their yield by a full 30%! Yeah I went there! Deal with it. Some highlights of awesome I discovered while playing this morning: The new Bjornholm map is excellent. I nice replacement to the old FS13 default They also included the newer 'Merican map for those of us who love huge tracks of land (if you know what I mean) After cultivating one field, your tractor is so muddy you can't even recognize the brand anymore!  Still looking for an ingame car wash, cause while mud is fun, I can't tell which tractor is which lol.  Still I count this as a huge positive. You leave tire tracks EVERYWHERE. Like, you can follow your path that you just bushwacked through your neighbor's backyard to the grainery since it leaves massive wheel scars as you blast through his barbque hauling a sowing machine at 35 km/h.   The new equipment on the Bjornholm map is fun.  Been working my way through the lesser tractors so far and while there are some familiar comfort-foods in there (looking at you Lindner Geotrack) it is still fun to experiment with some of the new stuff. When you start performing a task like cultivating, plowing, or sowing, for the first time you can actually feel the tractor throttle up and ""groan"" under the stress of tearing a device through the earth. It is such a satisfying addition to the game.  Before the tractor would just slowly throttle up to max speed and drive on. This time around you can sense the raw power the machine is belching out to perform the task. Well done Giant's Software for nailing that!  You have perfected the sim world even more. Did I mention collectable coins yet?   Same concept as horseshoes. I have not started the forestry path yet, But the concept alone intrigues me hard. Lastly, and this is a huge ++++  ....  you can finally hire someone to spray the fields.  (Drops mic, walks off stage) "

												Farming Simulator 15 is a simulator game developed by Giants Software. The game takes place in various locations across America and Europe. The goal of the game is to farm (surprisingly!), look after livestock and grow crops to sell. This is the seventh game in the Farming Simulator series releasing in May 2015. 2015 version of this game brings some new features, such as washable vehicles, 41 brands which work out to about 140 individual pieces of equipment.  The game has two game modes, career and multiplayer; this review will be based solely on the single player career mode. You start out in the career mode with a very outdated farm, and you are tasked with expanding and improving machinery and farm buildings to make more money.  The main way you do this is by growing crops and selling them. The tutorial at the start of the game does a very good job of explaining all of the controls and how you plant, grow, and farm crops. Once you are in the world, you are free to do what you want, wherever you want on your farm. You can invest money you make into new crops, additional fields, or equipment. Later in the game you can also add some livestock to your farm but you have to look after them as well as doing the other jobs. On top of the general up keep of your farm, you can also complete missions too, which are randomly generated, and normally come with some form of timescale on as well. Your rewards for completing the missions are usually money plus bonuses, depending on how quickly you finished it. Even though I was playing on 4k resolution, the environment still looks fairly poor. The machinery does seem to have slightly better graphics though, with some crisp textures. All of the machineries animations are down to a tee though; allowing you to see all moving parts.  This version of the game can also be modded though, with plenty of graphical mods available out there; you can increase the fidelity if you wish. The game does have a very good tutorial, but the game still has a fairly high learning curve if you want to do really well. I had to read tutorials, guides, and help files in order to progress at points to help me build an optimal farm. This is by no means a bad thing though; the level of detail that this game has is quite impressive, and anyone who is looking to get immersed into a game, probably will enjoy the variety of options on offer here. Whilst the game does not have an “end” to it; you can basically play it as long as you desire; I have been playing 21 hours so far, and feel as if I have got my worth out of it. There is a high level of replay-ability, but you could very well just have one farm and keep improving it on a single save. I only ran into one major technical problem, and that was if you are playing the game on a resolution which is not native to your windows resolution, the mouse cursor’s alignment will be off, but this was resolved by entering windows mode, and re-entering full screen mode. I would have liked the options to rebind a few keys, and also a bit of an extra graphics menu. The mouse sensitivity really needs to be cranked all the way up in game also, as it is horrendously slow. I went into this game with no prior knowledge of the series, no knowledge of farming at all, and felt I came out of the experience with at least a basic understanding on what goes on at a farm. The game is pretty slow paced and people who have little patience for this type of pacing will probably be better off staying away, but for someone who is looking to learn something new and have some fun doing it, you will definitely get some enjoyment out of Farming Simulator 15. The game’s full price is £19, 99 – given that I have played the game for 21 hours, I can’t complain too much, but I did purchase it whilst on sale and feel I have got a bit of a bargain now.  The sale price of £7, 99 is definitely worth considering if you are on the fence about this genre of game.  Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												The most polished installment of the series by far. Giants has really grown up in the past few years and matured the game from obscure niche title, to commercial success complete with all the hype that go along with a new release.So what's new compared to FS2013? If I had to describe it one word, REALISM. For starters the graphics and physics engine has been majorly overhauled and they've done a great job with. It runs like a dream, smooth as butter and isn't a huge hardware pig so it's well optimized. The screenshots really don't do it justice but there is a plethora of details added to the game, some very subtle and others not so subtle. Graphics and lighting are just better. The new tractor physics are really improved. Underpowered machines now really struggle uphill when pulling heavy loads and in some cases will stall or the wheels will just spin. Crash physics aren't so great but I overlook this because the game isn't about crashing. Everything in the gameworld is more detailed:1. Machines now get dirty and muddy over time and really grungy looking.2. The machines can now be powerwashed and also get washed during a rainstorm.3. Machines leave dust trails and tracks on the ground where you've driven.4. Little bits of cottonwood and allergens floating around in the air.5. All new and improved particle effects and animations from the chopped straw coming out the back of the harvesters.6. New particle effects and animations when unloading/loading grain.7. New realistic looking animations for churning soil when plowing or cultivating fields.8. All new animations for crop harvesting. Instead of the crops just disappearing when driving the harvester like in FS2013, they're actually animated now and get pulled into the header and swept to the center to the pickup shoot just like IRL.9. The drivers in the cab now turn the wheel when turning instead of having static arms/hands.10. Mirrors in the equipment now work and you can see behind you.11. Vehicle speed can now be fine tuned to your liking in 1mph/kph increments to better match harvester speeds.12. An in game semi transparent map overlay of the gameworld can be pulled up now while you drive with most of the major locations labeled so you don't have to refer to an external map.13. Sprayers and fertilizers can now be hired out. Woohoo!!!!I won't list them all but there are many others. The biggest thing added in terms of mechanics is the addition of forestry and logging. You can now engage in the planting, cutting and chipping of trees and selling them to the lumber mill or wood burning plant for big profit along with a nice selection of wood cutting and processing equipment and implements. Is it fun? Yes but like real life the handling of logs with 6 axis or more machines has a bit of a learning curve and can be frustrating at first, but very satisfying once you get the hang of it.Finally the interface has also been overhauled and is much cleaner, polished and more modern looking and generally better although I do miss the onscreen PDA which they've done away with.The core gameplay remains essentially the same and that's a good thing because it works.10/10			"

												Hi to all you farmers.Firstly this is a good game i have played it for over 100 hrs so i know it's good and bad points but over all it is a good game.PROS...It has very clear and sharp focuse grathics and runs at 60fpsYou can add modsIt does not slow your computer down when playingIt has 4 DLC packs heaving with lots of equipmentReasonable priceis an improvement on fs 2014Has cattle to care for.You can harvest timberCons...Fails to give a feeling of real life such as it has no wildlife like birds in the sky flying or foxes and rabbits or deer and squrrils adding these things would be like on a real farm.Needs to add pigs to care for.There is no 12 month cycle such as winter, sping, summer, autum as it would be nice to see snow in winter.Needs more DLC as not everyone likes to add mods in case of game conflictsNeeds more maps and bigger maps tooNeed to feed chickens with seedNeed to collect milk with tanker to sell to shopsNeed a egg station to store and box up your eggs then crate them and load them onto lorry to sell.Need to use more then 1 hired workerNeed more trucks and Equipment.Need more steam achievements.Would be nice to have a wine vinyard and produce wine.Be able to plant grapes for your vinyard red and green grape fieldsNeed strawberry field and produce strawberrys also apple trees to produce ciderNeed to plant mustard cropsThere is so much more i could suggest but it would end up being a bookBugs...Traffice and hired worker has no AI as many times vehicles will collide with each otherGrass verge is to narrow next to roads which causes collisons with traffic when vehicle is turning.Collisons with barn on plot 16 when using the HORSCH Pronto 9 SW sowing machine reason for this is the sowing machine is very long and not enough space to turn...to get around this bug just plant one strip of grass to make distance between barn and edge of field wider so vehicle will turn when using hired worker.The Zunhammer SKE 18.5 PU Slurry Tank runs out to quickly and need to refill many times to do one crop.Over all this is still a good game which will give you hours of fun but needs a patch to correct some of these issues.Many people report having issues with this game and this is due to them adding mods as some mods will conflict with other mods and prevent the game running or working properly...please add and test 1 mod at a time before adding another mod and always make a backup copy of your saved file before adding, deleting, or altering anything.If you buy this game it will be worth it and i will give it a thumbs up but i rate it 7 out of 10 and when this game is improved i will give it a higher rating.Hope you enjoyed my review and i hope it helps you.

												So I'm having a blast with the game so far.  The improvements over FS13 are pretty dramatic in a lot of areas.  The vehicle modeling is vastly improved, showing far more detail and complexity in various areas.  The cabins now have fully-functioning side mirrors and all the dashboard dials are fully animated.  Combined with the new lighting engine, the collection of vehicles and equipment are far more gorgeous than they have any right to be in a mere Sim title.On the downside, the environments look largely the same as FS13.  You can notice sharper texture work all around (buildings, stone walls, etc.) but harvest-ready wheat, canola, corn, etc. seems carried over from the last game.  The biggest offender is the draw distance, which hasn't changed much.  I know it can be difficult to render natural environments with expansive, flat planes that stretch on forever, but the graphical fill-in render distance feels way too short.It's not all bad on the environmental front.  There's been numerous upgrades as well.  Vehicles leave tire tracks behind them and kick up dust.  Harvesting fruit is now fully animated (instead of simply disappearing when collected, it's now cut-down and pulled through the rotating header blades).  Similarly, treated soil is now animated when plowed and cultivated, showing churning dirt under the blades instead of a simple texture swap in FS13.  Vehicles now get muddy with prolonged use.  A handy high-pressure sprayer allows you to manually wash them off.  I do think the dirt accumulation happens way too fast though.  I like effect, but your equipment can get completely covered in mere minutes.  I'll be looking forward to a mod that stretches out dirt accumulation over a longer period.As advertised the physics engine has undergone a full overhaul.  Vehicles now have weight to them.  You can feel it when you're pulling heavier equipment and your speed pulls back when riding up inclines.  Equipment is now power-rated, meaning low-rpm tractors can not pull larger loads as there's a minimum threshold they must meet.   Overall, the machinery feels heavier and more substantive, like they stick to the ground vs. flying off on the slightest whim in FS13.  There's also been an upgrade in the audio dept. as engine sounds are deeper and more guttural, adding to the sense of authenticity.Side missions are handled more intelligently in the new game.  Instead of having them pop up at pre-set intervals, you instead travel job boards located around the map and pick from a list of job opportunities.  You still have lawn-mowing and pallet delivery missions, but they've also added 'great demand' requests for various grains.  Picking when and what you want to do makes you feel more in control of collecting extra coin when needed.So all in all I'm really enjoying my time with Farming Simulator 15.  It's just as Zen & relaxing as ever, only this time out if feels entirely Bigger, Better, & More Bad♥♥♥♥♥  The game feels like it's come into its own and is finally in the Big Leagues.  It's met all my ""upgrade expectations"" that were set in motion during the initial media rollout and info dump regarding new graphics and physics engines.  Honesty, when standing FS13 and FS15 side by side, I can't help but think about the all-around qualitative leap from Euro Truck Simulator to Euro Truck Simulator 2.  ETS2 was a breakout hit for SCS Software that had enough crossover appeal to even help legitimize the oft-stigmatized Mundane Vehicle Simulator (tm.) genre with the masses.  I'm now wondering if it's FS15's turn to make a similar leap in awareness and appreciation.  Seeing it sit at #1 on the Steam Top Sellers chart every day since release has been a positive nod in that direction.Side note: Been playing for over 7 hours and I haven't even touched the new Logging feature set, so I have no feedback in that regard.  I've never been into money-cheat mods, opting instead to build my empire up from the ground floor, adding to my fleet piece by incremental piece.  I'll get there in due time.  I'm in no hurry.			"

I went to work the next day without having slept the day before. I just...lost track of space and time. All I did was harvest my wheat and plant Canola and 2 hours just went by like that.

												Overall, a good game. However, if you have any plans of running your own dedicated server, you should reconsider before buying.""A separate Farming Simulator 15 license is needed for each Dedicated Server. You can't play with the same license key as a client on a server."" - Dedicated Server DocumentationThis should be unacceptable from any game developer, as dedicated server support should be a selling point of the game, not a way of leeching money from your playerbase.The idea of rentable multiplayer servers is fine, as it is an option for anyone without the resources to host their own. However, requiring that an entirely separate copy of the game be purchased, with the soul purpose of running a dedicated server, NOT playing the game, should not be tolerated. To add to this, Steam does not even support owning two copies of the game, you would either have to buy it through another retailer, or create another Steam account just for the purpose of running a dedicated server.I am absolutely appalled by the fact this is accepted by the community.  Games like Minecraft, Terraria, Team Fortress 2, Half Life, Just Cause 2, and an entire list of games providing the means for runing a dedicated server included with the purchase of the game. Mod support will only get you so far when you spit back in the face of the same player base with a policy like this.As an end-user, great game. As someone in IT who cares about the direction games are headed, 3/10. Most people with look over this and blow it off because it does not affect them. However, if you play any multiplayer in this game, someone, somewhere has paid extra to allow you to.This will be the last game by Giants I will own unless changes are made in the future.			"

												Even real farmers play Farming Simulator! Whilst it is still a little way from being a simulator in the true sense of the word (for example, gears are not fully simulated, tractors do not show real damage, crops grow too fast and its a bit too easy to make money), nevertheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and for every weakness, there are many realistic features. It's great fun if you have any interest in farming and you like the productive strategy type game rather than the fast paced shooters. I worked on a farm many years ago, and I played with Britains farm toys as a kid. This game, 40yr later, allows me to own and drive any type of tractor & implement, and farm any crop, & the physics and graphics are easily good enough to bring back the memories of driving the real thing. Giants also give good support, they updated FS2013 regularly, so I hope to see the same improvements and developments in this one;and they offer good (many free) addon mods form time to time.It's also very moddable, so if there is an aspect that lets the game down, it is very likely that someone has added a mod to fix it, or else you can do it yourself. For example, it is not difficult to edit the start machinery and funds, or to change growth rate or values to make the game more difficult, or even to create your own map with a bit of learning. Stand by to be labelled a farm nerd (similar to trainspotter), but that matters not to me. Excellent game, worth at least 8 out of 10 on release, and expecting that to rise with future patches.  :)			"

												Not a bad game at all, very realistic in most aspects, but very very buggy at times.  The wood chipper is a prime example.  It is so buggy and underpowered, it makes one think that these guys have never seen one in action.  Once they grab a log, there is no going back, it is shredded.  Short of turning off the equipment, there is no way to get the log out of it.  In this offering, your main task is to get the log to go INTO it.  Even when it does, there is a very high chance it will be just spit out again.  Actually all trees can get very buggy at times.  Ghost logs, screwed up cuts, ( they are still attached to the main log even though cut off), trees that decide to disobey the laws of physics. ( standing verticle instead of falling over)Another issue this game has is BAD and I mean very bad physics.  You can look forward to all your vehicles spinning out for no reason.  Even a tractor going 20 miles and hour will do donuts on you.  Tractors jumping 10 feet in the air on the least bump, total loss of steering unless you are under 10 MPH, and if you over steer an instant jacknife/donut.Smaller issues are with any vehicle that has an articulating joint.  Constant cameras switching angles while trying to drive these vehicles will give the average person headaches in minutes.  Just bad physics and bad camera useage on these vehicles.  Another smaller issue is with traction.  Some of these tractors are over 400 HP, and yet they can't climb a 15% grade pullling an empty trailer.  These tractors in real life are able to crawl up 30 and 40 degree slopes, but not here.  It gets annoying fast when a 400 HP tractor powers out going up a hill with nothing attached to it.If you are looking for a genuine farming experience with real world physics, and handling.  Skip this one.  It needs alot of love before it reaches that point.On the other hand, If you are into eye candy, can live with ridiculous physics, and don't mind the odd bug or two.  By all means, you will not be disappointed.  The world is very beautiful, vehicles and equipment are immaculate, everything is very pleasing to the eye and very well presented.  Prices are a little under what they should be, but that helps get into the high end game a little faster.Logging can get you cash fast, and with the ability to buy and place your own trees, will mean an ever lasting cash influx to get those high end machines your farm needs to grow.  Buying cows and chickens can also benefit you, but don't get ahead of yourself.  Owning and feeding cows requires alot of equipment and should be saved for later on.  Chickens can get you a bit of cash, but are unreliable as a means of income late game.the tractors, for the most part behave as one should expect, but are a bit underpowered and can be hard to control at times.  Understeering/oversteering is always an issue.  But they are still fun to pilot.  The truth is in the game, farming is one of the most expensive occupations a man can persue and the game reflects that wonderfully.  Think you have 2 million and the world is yours?  Think again, that's a new tractor, combine and header witha  new cart thrown in.  Maybe a piece of land to add to your growing farming empire.  Some of the hirees, are bums, they leave strips all over the field, miss seeding sections, leave strips unplanted.  But as the saying goes, it's hard to get good help.  You get what you pay for.  All in all, the game is fiarly decent, brought me hours of fun and enjoyment.  Took me back when I grew up on the farm and drove tractors and harvesters just like these.  I guess that's why my view on the physics of the game is a bit demanding.  I have driven this equipment, I know what it does and what it is capable of, and was expecting this game to reflect that.  It does not, not even close.  I was fully looking forward to watching these diesel demons start grunting and pouring out the black coal.  They don't grunt, it's actually more like a soft whimper.I would suggest that they need to get behind the controls of these monsters and actually experience what they do before tring to put forth a digital representation of these beasts.   To the average city slicker, who doesn't know the difference, it will pass.  For those of us good old boys that grew up driving these metal behemoths, it falls short to the point of stopping playing putting down your mouse and hollering;  ""Yo! Earl!, check this out!... I can do 180's in a 40,000 LB tractor at 20 MPH!""  You ever trying spinning a donut in a 20 ton Tractor?  It's bloody impossible!  They are designed to stay stuck to the ground, that's what they do!  Only time I was able to spin one of these bad boys out was on ice. and that was full bore into a turn towing 10 tons of cow dung.  Try it on dirt, and you will not succeed.			"

												It's difficult to explain the appeal of this game, especially when I don't entirely understand it myself. I'm not a grind-gamer by nature, so it's a mystery as to why I will sit for hours on end, drinking coffee and grinding away at fields. But sit I do, pot upon pot of coffee, field upon field of wheat, canola, a little corn to fill the bunkers. I can't really classify it as boring. I guess if you have a technical nature like I do you will find the machinery interesting. I live in a farm county and never payed much attention to the tractors and such roaming the fields nearby, mainly because I'm not a farmer. But now I notice all of them as I drive by. Passing the local equipment supplier, I find myself thinking ""Hey, they have a 10.9 in the yard. I wonder if they have the large header for it. I'd like to climb inside and push buttons."" and ""why don't they make those manure spreaders larger?""Learning, I guess is what draws myself to this. I've spent a bit of time on the net looking up details of the machinery, how they function, etc. Even the growth cycle of corn.Do I recommend this for everyone? No. Action junkies will probably not like it. If you like making artificial money in an artificial world and get some sense of accomplishment from it, you probably will like it.			"

												This game is superb. If you were turned of the last one by the graphics (filthy peasant) or by the lack of physics but really wanted a good farming sim this is the game for you!Let me start by saying the graphics are great! I mean great!!! The screenshots loot pretty much like the game I think they have touched them up a bit but overall veeery similar. There are tyre tracks, tractors get dirty and have to be cleaned these dont sound like much but its the little things that make a game.The physics are actually there!! not only that but so far they are great! when compared to the last game there still pretty average. Your tractor slows down up hill gets tossed about a bit when your plowing to mimick the friction of the dirt and if you are working on a slope you will go down it. Also when loading a trailer you can affect how it is loaded by where you position it relative to the loading device.Overall a great game so far however there is one bug that annoys me the grabber things that hold onto stuff have no hitbox so you can get stuck on things if you have something attached to it and wrap yourself around a fence but other than that great so far! If you want a farming simulator to muck about in then this is the game for you. 8.5/10Wow this was longer than expected heh.			"

												Love the game, but to call it a simulator is not correct. As a former dairy farmer I can say that if it was this easy in real life, I`d still be doing it...I`m sure that if I jump in my tractor right now (Case IH 2007) and steer it into a brick wall that would be the end for it. AND ever so often it needs service, I can't just drive and drive forever on it. This ""simulator"" lacks the realism of real life farming and should therefore be called a farming/driving/arcade game!But still, Its a great GAME that I can recommend to all who is interested in farming.Updated 09.04.15:Hopefully this review update takes care of my unfortunate misspelling of the word ""tractor"". I live in Norway where our native, and first language is Norwegian, so I`m sorry if my spelling and/or grammar is a bit off when it comes to English.			"

												I've never been in to Simulator games, From the 90s on i've found them boring as heck! Living in the country surrounded by farm land and from a recommendation from a friend I was enticed in to try this.    It's critical you watch a few videos first to get a understanding of what to do.  I did that before buying this. I've spend over 50 hours in this game. That's quite a lot for me these days.  While on paper simulators and one about farming sounds boring, I found this to be the most rewarding game in recent years for entertainment value.    If your a solo player like me and want to do one of the bigger maps. You really have to start modding the game so you can harvest and replant a feild in an hours time .  I found it pretty educational as well.  I always wondered why a farm around my way had a massive white tarp with hundreds of tires on top of it. Figured it was used to dry grain.  While driving past it last week I noticed the cover was off and saw dark hay and realized it was Silege, something I didn't know prior to this game.    I can also identify and understand all the farm equipment that drives past my house.  While the game is simple in nature there is something very therapeutic about it and fun.    My only 2 complaints is the size of the equipment later on in the game when you make out well is too taxing with time to manage as a solo player, it can be hard to find the right mode that balances this so it's not too strong and takes the fun of it.     My other complaint is some actions such as bailing hay, mowing grass, and hauling product does not have a autopilot feature. Doesn't sound like a big deal and it's not starting out.  But when your managing a lot of stuff all your time is invested in performing those same exact actions manually and it's no longer enjoyable because your forced to spend all your time doing it.   If they added that I have no doubt I could pick it up again and keep going.   Recommend this game for sure, had a great time.			"

												For me, the sweet spot in this game is the slow build of my farm. When I first started, I used a money hack and bought all the best machines, only to get bored of the game within a week. Then I came back to it after some time had passed, found a third party map I really liked, started a new game, and decided that's where I would ""settle"". Over many in-game months, I went from a few tractors to a full-scale industrial-grade operation. And therein lies the fun for me: slowly upgrading and expanding your vehicle fleet with your hard-earned cash. Going from a dinky little 90 hp tractor to a larger, more efficient 200 hp model...Mmm, bliss.Managing the farm chores and keeping an eye on the demand for your products is all part of the fun of course, but as a kid, I always wanted a video game that lets you load trucks with loaders, forklifts and excavators. As an adult, I'm overjoyed to be doing that now. While there are no excavators in the vanilla game, nor can you dig up the ground, there are some beautifully detailed excavators available from the modding community. And ""excavating"" a pile of corn or silage and loading it into a dump truck is a fair enough compromise. (I know there are simulators on the market that allow you to excavate and haul earth, but not a single one has been half as satisfying as this game has been.)Bottom line: this is a simulator, and as such, it's not going to convert high octane gamers. It was designed for people who like the sound and feel of heavy machinery, or the repetitive and relaxing motions of harvesting a large field, or selling a large trailer's worth of goods for an enormous profit. Giants Software knows the audience they're targeting, and does a good job of delivering what that audience wants.I guess you folks like pros and cons, so here is my list:PRO-Tons of vehicles to drive.-Lots of ways to make money (if you're patient).-Dirt and grime build-up adds to immersion; washing a vehicle can be extremely satisfying.-You could ignore the farm aspect and just call this ""Logging Simulator"". Logging has a steeper learning curve than farming, but is just as fun, with a lot of third party machinery out there to augment what's available in the base game.-Very detailed cabs. I play the game almost exclusively in-cab.-Functional mirrors.-Dozens, if not hundreds of hours of enjoyment possible, if you're into laid back games.CON-With the exception of the vehicles, which look exquisite, the graphics are a bit dated.-No true digging capabilities yet (though Giants software has suggested that might be coming in future releases).-Vehicles do not have gears or shifting (there are mods for that).-Vehicles only start up or power down when you enter or exit them (there are mods for that too).I was on the fence about buying this title. I just wanted to load trucks with heavy machinery, and figured you'd have to work a lot before you'd reach that point. I was right, but what I didn't anticipate was how much I enjoyed getting to that point, and going beyond it.			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is actually more then just a farming simulator, it is a combination of many simulations. It involves all the chores of farming but on top of that it involves financial management, crop management, market segmentation, and for those advanced Multiplayers Forestry discipline, Soil Ph calibration, Construction Manufacturing and Mass Production venues. If you enjoy relaxing (non stress pressure type of) games, (and having an attention span of more then 5 seconds), or if you hate being on the edge of your seat, gripping for your headsets because oh there are to many demanding games out there that are just simply not creative just mind numbing..... I say if you like to( playe relaxed and chill) then your in the right place.This game is a constructive simulation with a flavor of a Sandbox, you are incharge, where you are working towards a productive goal with no pressure like ( omg I need to make this quest in5 hours) and also if willing to share it with your friends or even kids, it is family oriented and realistic.The vanilla version of the game is quite limited, however I chose to only to play lately Multiplayer which involves interactions with Human Farmers, builders, drivers with the immersion of Modifications of vehicles, tools or Maps that are 100+ fields with a complex economies, construction and manufacturing industries such as Gold Prospecting, Coal Mining, Salt Quarry, Sand digging, Cement Factories, Cheese factories, Soup, Pizza, beverages and many more which lead to producing materials that you can actually sell and or build buildings with.If you want to play a fast (street fighter or couter strike type and squirt 30 minutes a day) this is not for you, this is for the intelligent and enjoyable folks who love the aspect of simulation gaming. This is a game that takes time, strategy and understanding, it also brings in a very low pressure atmosphere which makes it super fun, and you can challange yourself, how ever you want but at your own decision.Here is my challange:

												I was a hardcore FS2013 fan, for that reason I love this. New graphics of course, and cutting down trees. The best part is being able to cut down trees blocking fields and workers in the equipment. This was the biggest problem for me in FS2013, you can cut trees that tractors are hung up on. The maps are huge, plenty of room to stretch your legs. Also lots of farming fields, you'll never run out.Bugs are the only drawback, there aren't any show stoppers though. Very minor stuff. The physics work much better than FS2013, though is still buggy at times. Bumping a rock for example can (rarely) send your machine across the map. The automated workers at least attempt to fix from getting stuck at the edge of fields. Don't make them too large, also. The missions are given out at job boards. You can set the frequency (mine is set to 2min), and multiple jobs come in. FS2013 put the machines on your screen, was annoying. I keep a cheap tractor at the job board to check missions constantly. For whatever reason, a massive bonus of several hundred thousand dollars comes with the farming missions. The payout would be 10,000 ish, and the bonus could be 400,000 dollars.. what? The drawback is these missions may or may not pop up often. Once I got 3 missions at a time, other times I had to wait several days. I expect this to be fixed? who knows, it's the only true way to get money quickly.The job board is almost always pallet missions, that is, pickup a pallet and drop off to said location. Those get old very quickly.. Grass cuttng mission is painfully slow until you get both front and back mowers. There is no longer the useless riding mower, also.As with FS2013 farming, farming the largest fields with the largest/quickest equipment is the key to success. The tractors are the same, maybe a couple new here or there. But the graphics overall is such a huge improvement. You can wash your equipment for kicks, or if you are really, really bored.The starter equipment is much better as well, the very basic tractors go 42mph. No more rust bucket putt putts. They have high maint cost of course, the sooner you get rid of them the better.Overall, they thought BIGGER with FS2015 as an improvement. There is rarely flat terrain. Everywhere has hills, sometimes road going up very steep terrain. Improperly powered tractors have no chance of pulling trailers up steep hills. The way things are laid out, you are sometimes better off taking the roads. Versus FS2013, you would bee line towards your point, plummeting down the sides of hills.Other thoughts:The reset button needs some kind of timeout. It's too tempting to reset your tractors and equipment constantly. Maybe a minute or so, nothing silly.Picking up trees is hard, period. I've spent a good amount of time picking up tree trunks, sometimes it takes several minutes PER log, you need to gather hundreds of them.			"

												Journal Entry 1 Upon entering my new farm I have a goal, a goal which will include everything but farming. I am a logger and I'm going to cut down trees. I first discover a wide variety of farming equipment at my disposal. Harvesters, Combines, Tractors, all beautifully built and glistening in the sunlight. I decide to sell all of them in return for cash to spend on my logging dream. Journal Entry 2 After selling all my equipment, spare one green tractor, I find myself still too broke to buy the Ponnse Processor or Buffalo. I opt for a chainsaw in the hopes that I can at least get things started. Although there is no plow blade for the tractor, I simply purchase a large weight that will attach to the front as my new bumper. I now have a means to cut down trees and a vehicle that can at least push the bits around until I get richer. Journal Entry 3 I start things off by testing out my new chainsaw on a random tree (assuming that it wouldn't work on all trees). I pull out my husqvarna chainsaw and rev it up with a satisfying growl. To my surprise im able to cut down any of the trees that I see in the area. I pick a large poplar tree and make a precise angle slice in the base, a few moments of teedering and boom down she goes. I now discover that I'm able to buck this tree into as many bits that I want. Seriously I can cut this thing in to 1/10000's if I feel the need. After going Texas chainsaw massacre on the tree for about 15 mins I realize that the mill is on the other side of the map, screw this tree were heading for something closer. Journal Entry 4 After trekking around the vast map full of lush trees, people, houses and breathtaking scenery I find myself at a rail yard. I have 3 points to unload logs, either at the train, the station beside the train or the big watery log pond in front of the mill. Since I only have my tractor as a pushing device I decide to start with the pond. I gracefully fall down trees bucking them up for what seems like hours. I carefully use my tractor as a plow and push the chopped tree bits into the pond gaining me more and more money. Finally after a few hours of hard work I have enough to purchase my Ponsse Processor. Journal Entry 5 I feel like I've earned this, The purchase feels great, it feels right and im honored to own such a beautifully crafted logging vehicle. I hop in and start it up, It sounds heavy and roars when I lay down the throttle. This is what I've been waiting for, I head back towards the mill. I am now able to grab trees directly from standing and delimb/cut them into whatever lengths I choose. A small LCD screen inside the detailed cockpit tells me my length setup. I start grabbing trees and dragging them over to the pond, While over top of the pond I cut the tree into sections and drop them into the water. Now were making real money, I repeat this process until I again have enough money for my next investment the Ponnse Buffalo. Journal Entry 6 I have purchased the Buffalo which has a similar build to the Processor but instead it has a big grapple for picking up logs and a bunk for stacking the logs and bringing them back to the mill. Now that I've cut down all the trees close to the mill It will be faster to process piles of lumber in the bush and just haul back double the amount on the buffalo. I have already processed several trees into nice neat piles so I take the buffalo out. While tearing up the side of the mountain to my new cut block I am starting to notice big mud tracks forming on the road and the mud splashes all over my vehicles, now were logging! Journal Entry 7 I have loaded up my buffalo using it crane arm and grapple on all my pre-cut logs. I now have to carefully sneak back down the hill and get this stuff into the bank. Unfortunately I went a little to fast on one section and clipped a stump of a previously cut tree, this sent half my logs flying out of the bunks and all over the road. I then spent the next 20 mins maneuvering around cleaning up the mess. It pays to take your time.Journal Entry 8 I have now delivered my logs and understand the process of logging, Its an addictive cycle and yet very relaxing. The repetition that would seemingly bore others to death becomes my salvation for peace. I park my 3 vehicles, grab the pressure washer and start to clean all the mud off in preparation for the next day. I am a now a virtual logger and im proud of it ;)			"

												Giants software mad a really nice game. You can really see they listened to the community by adding forestry and making a better map (the map looks like it has things that the community made in maps like more mountains and tight roads). Graphics are much better and so are the physics. The game has a lot of stuff to buy and play around with and if you don't want to wait until you have enough money for that there's always mods to download wich let you change your money. :) Though I don't recommend doing that cause I think it'll take away the fun of getting further in the game. Getting enough money to buy new stuff is what keeps the game fun in my opinion, cause you'll find yourself doing a lot of the same stuff over and over. You can hire workers wich I really recommend. The game has a lot of mods which you can install by dragging the zip file to your mods folder (shouldn't be hard at all).The multiplayer works pretty okay. I didn't play it much but though there can be some lagg and when someone joins the game has to sync which makes you unable to do anything for a short time, the multiplayer still can be a lot of fun and I can imagine you could have a lot of fun when you're playing on your own server with people that live nearby (better connection).Over all I recommend this game if you like simulation and farming, but if you only like games with a lot of action, then I wouldn't recommend buying this game. :)+ Graphics and physics are improved+ Map is (in my opinion) improved+ Lots of things to buy like tractors, trucks, tippers, etc.+ Lots of mods which are easy to install- Multiplayer laggs a bit for me and has to sync the game when someone joins- Gameplay can be a bit repetitive8,5/10Hope this helped :)			"

												First off all: This game is incredibly fun and relaxing.You'd think it is super boring, but it really is not. Hell, I thought it was♥♥♥♥♥♥before I got it but it is so fun. There's a huge variety of machinery that you can buy, two very nice maps and tons of ways to earn your money. The physics engine is okay, pulling stuff up a hill feels rough at times and I think some tractors or combines slow down too much when pulling stuff up a hill (A 1100 PS Krone combine can't pull 50.000L silage up a ≈10° inclination for example), but after all the feeling when driving a vehicle is pretty okay, it feels similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2 in some aspects. The multiplayer is a blast aswell. Everything is more fun with friends, from managing your farm over harvesting your crop to fooling around with a Telehandler. It's great.I can really recommend this, It might not be everyones cup of tea, so before buying you should probably watch a gameplay video or two but if you like simulators, this is a good game for you.

												9/10.I've got a farming sim problem.  It's very relaxing, but also feels like my second job.  The addition of forestry does add a new element to the game, which is very easy to amass a fortune early on in the game.  The graphic upgrade is awesome.  The interface feels new and polished.  Ofcourse, there are several bugs at this stage.  The physics could use a little tweaking and the logging station has several issues with the unloading area at the train.  The ability to cut down pesky trees that get hired workers caught up is a nice touch!PROs - Graphics, Interface, Vehicle/Implement List, Forestry, Updated Challenge System, Dirt/Tire Tracking and FUN!CONs - Physics Bugs (Forestry Mainly), Easy to Make a Fortune (good/bad?), Manual is Lacking in Description (Big Learning Curve), No Forestry Tutorial and only One New Map.Regardless, if you're reading this...BUY IT!  If you're a seasoned FS player or a newbie, this is a great addition to the library.  A Warning though: it is VERY TIME CONSUMING!			"

												Originally I figured this would be boring, how much fun can farming be, seriously?  I was wrong, graphics are awesome, game play is as close to real life as you can get, and having grown up on a farm, the realism is just crazy.  This game is strangley addictive, I can stop playing.  The modding community for this game is awesome, some of the mods that are available (and more coming every day) are just mind blowing.Definitely worth the money, in fact I've even considered buying the previous version just to play it and see how things have evolved.

												If you like machines and tractors this is a great buy! Play with friends, it's much more fun having a farm together!Playing with an xbox-controller is recomended when logging. I would really recommend this game! There's tons of mods that just makes the game much better.When playing online, my friends can join me and our farm. But the save file for the farm is on my computer. So when i'm offline, my friends can't play on our farm. It would be better if you could save your farm as a server in the cloud. So that my friends could join even if i'm offline.Pros-Lots of machines, trailers etc  to buy.-Many mods.-The overall feeling when playing is fantastic, you are your own little farmer. -Many tractors, trailers etc that you can buy-The tractors, trailers and machines are very detailed.The Cons, that I want to be improved in the next game.-Old graphics. Half Life 2 looks better (Half Life 2 was released 2004..)-When plowing or cultivating a field, it's just a plain texture that changes. Nothing exciting really.-The graphics aren't the best. Especially the lightning.-Need friends I wish that they could implement the mud from spintires for the next game. That would be awesome!			"

It's time to plow some fieldsI love relaxing games, sometimes you want just sit and relax and this game can be really fun and relaxing, but it suffers from a few problems.First i want to say that i don‘t dislike this game, but on steam you choose either positive or negative review. I would rate this game a strong 6, so giving it a negative rating doesn‘t mean the game is bad, it‘s just lacks many things. Mainly i‘m giving a negative review for lack of effort from developers while making this game.The gameplay is the same as in previous game. Except this time there‘s a forestry. Well, i thought so, but you just cut down trees growing on the side of the road and throw them into a pond to receive money. It would be nice to have real forests. The tree cutting physics could be better and more accurate. Sometimes it‘s too difficult to do everything from cutting the tree to throwing it into the pond. Physics are just off a bit. Talking about physics, this game doesn‘t shine in physics department. The tractor handling is very arcadey, the whole game is very arcadey. I want handling and physics to be something like Professional farmer. That game does some things better than Farming simulator, but sadly it‘s too buggy to play and developers abandoned the game and moved on to the next one. Another thing Pro farmer has done better is seasons. In this day and age it would be nice to have such simple feature. Considering the sale numbers this game has, developers should have more than enough money to make this game better.This game fails at career...again. Career is simply a sandbox mode without any goals. You‘re the only farmer in the village and companies compete with each other who will pay you the most. It‘s just stupid. The map feels very empty. You don‘t have any control over your company, no management, nothing. You can hire a worker, but he appears when you hire him and disappears when you let him go. Your workers doesn‘t walk around doing things, it‘s like they‘re not existent. At least it's good the game has achievements so they will keep you occupied for some time.Graphics are slightly better than in 2013. The tractors and equipment now gets dirty after some time. Also they look pretty good. But that‘s it. The environments are terrible. Trees are ugly, they don‘t move, leaves are static, grass is low quality too. The worst is the sky. It‘s so bad it‘s ridiculous. People the game is made in 2014! The whole sky is one and the same flat sky texture which changes color depending on the time of day. There's no real lighting, the clouds are static flat textures and they don‘t move, sun is at the same spot all day, but shadows on the ground are still moving. It‘s really horrible and is unacceptable in this day.Plowing, seeding, harvesting is still fun. It‘s repetitive but relaxing, if you had goals in the game it would be much more fun. After hours of doing the same actions it gets boring.I would recommend this game if you don‘t own the previous one. You‘ll have some fun, but if own FS2013, this game doesn‘t offer anything new or different, it simply lacks improvements.I have hope that Cattle&Crops will be a good farming game and it will bring some competition.Pros:Gameplay is kinda fun and relaxingTractors/equipment models look niceCons:Outdated graphicsForestry lacks depthNo career modeNo managementNo AINo physicsToo arcadey			"

												To be honest I haven't written many reviews lately, but thats mostly because i havent found a game I really wanted to promote. Farming Simulator 2015 is much more than meets the eye and will provide you hours upon hours of enjoyable gameplayThe best features about this game for me was the atmosphere and the machinary. The day/night system, the weather, and the environment captured me immediately. On one side of a map theres a lighthouse and every time i was working the fields at night Id a the powerful light circleing around. Id also enjoy something as small as a plane flying over the farm just because it made the game feel real.On the other hand the variety of machines are amazing to use as they were completely new to me and since their sounds were so real. As you progress through the game you also get to purchaase numerous machines all of which have their own speacial use.The only downside I have about this game was the Multiplayer and how difficult it is to join with a friend. I tried to join and host but me nor my friend could get on each others servers. This was definitely one of the features I couldnt wait to use so I was highly dissapointed.Overall a fantastic game that is definitely worth the money even without the sale. In Farming Simulator '15 there is so much to do and so many ways to play that it will keep you at your computer for hours on end.			"

The Graphics are HQ and they have improved so much more to do with the little things such as a updated and easier to use shopping system and new vehicles . The New Engine is Superb creating tracks for your vehicle in the mud and dust effects as well as your machinery getting dirty meaning you have to clean it , the Forestry is just the iceing on the cake I LOVE IT !  So if you have the choice to  buy this game  , DO IT  you will never regret it !			"

Paved ParadiseI work in a big city, glass, steel and concrete, that’s my environment.Sure I live in the “leafy” suburbs, I see the occasional tree or patch of grass during my commute, but it’s quickly replaced by high rise buildings, traffic and thousands of other suited and booted clones all bustling around doing “business things” and generally getting in each others way.Urban NinjaTo me, countryside is something you see rushing passed the window of a train, a blur of green glimpsed at the edge of my vision whilst I sit, smart phone in hand, pretending I’m a ninja and that fruit is my mortal enemy.I’m vaguely aware that some of the fruit I’m so deftly slicing with my virtual blade could well be growing in the real world fields flashing passed the window, but only in the sense that I’m also vaguely aware that I’m not really a ninja.Rural RecognitionSometimes the fields change colour, yellows and browns instead of greens, different crops growing I guess but I couldn’t tell you what they are.I’m a little better at livestock, I can tell the difference between a cow and a chicken and I know they’re both tasty, but their journey from blissful ignorance to yummy burger is something I don’t really want to think about, so I keep slicing the fruit and eating the burgers as ignorant in my own way as the cattle idly watching the train rush by.Trip to the CountrySpending vacation time in the countryside provides some pretty scenery; it helps fill a rural gap in your soul.There are tractors trundling around with all sorts of alien looking machinery attached to them which probably have something to do with converting the fields full of colourful plants into what you ate for breakfast.It’s all very curious in the same “I don’t need to know” kind of way that a cow watching a train go past might be curious for a moment and then go back to eating the grass.  (Do cows eat grass or is that sheep?)Cows Don’t Eat Sheep!Sure, it’s a pleasant break, you come away rested and relaxed but likely still just as ignorant to the workings of the patchwork fields that made up that rural vista you enjoyed so much.This is where Farming Simulator 2015 steps in, with all its clever rural knowledge, its open world countryside to explore and a whole host of those strange “Farming Machines” for you to drive around, best of all, you don’t need to get up at 4am and put on your wellingtons to enjoy it.(Although you can... if it makes you happy!)Pretty as a PictureThe Farming Simulator franchise has been around for a while now, each iteration bringing a new open world to explore, new game mechanics and updated visuals.I’m happy to say the latest outing doesn’t disappoint.This is by far the most visually impressive Farming Simulator to date, the countryside is lush and colourful, the day and night cycle is suitably impressive and the vehicles are all beautifully modelled. (I used to think that if you’d seen one tractor, you’d seen them all – not so!)Let’s Get PhysicalPhysics in the game have been updated too, this time around your vehicles will leave deep tire tracks in the mud, ploughing and tilling soil will create troughs and ridges that you don’t want to get stuck in, we’re not talking “Spintires” levels of muddy terrain here, but enough for you to notice its impact, The physics in Farming Simulator 2015 really do help add to the sense of realism when driving around in the world.And what a world it is, you get two maps with the game, one in beautiful Bjornholm which contains a built in tutorial to get started working the land, the other is in wonderful Westbirdge, both maps are well designed and provide equally interesting open worlds to explore.FPSFor the uninitiated to the franchise, Farming Simulator is exactly what is says on the tin, A simulation of a working farm.You start the game with your farmhouse, a few low end tractors, some basic machinery and a couple of fields.From there you’ll be preparing the soil, planting and harvesting a variety of different crops and either using them yourself as a resource for another farming related activity or more likely loading them onto a trailer, hooking it up to a tractor and driving it to sell at market.You can control each vehicle from a third or first person perspective depending on your preference and drive around the open map to your hearts content (or at least until you run out of petrol).You can hop out and walk around freely too. What we have here is an FPS (Farming Person Simulator).Bovine BuddiesIn addition to all the ploughing, seed sowing and harvesting of crops, which is much more fun than it sounds, there are several other agriculturally related activities for you try your hand at.Buying some livestock might be a good way to make some extra money; if you feel the need you could also just hang out with them in their field and watch the sun set (and if you’re the person getting up at 4am with your galoshes on to play farming simulator then I expect you’ll also be the one who feels that particular need.)I’m a Lumberjack and I’m OKForestry has been introduced officially into this 2015 instalment too, so if you’ve always fancied yourself as a bit of a lumberjack then you can put on your chequered shirt, (not literally, my early rising, welly wearing friend of the cows.) grab your chain saw and go ruin a trees day, no one will stop you, you’ve got a chainsaw!Piggy BankSo now you’ve dabbled in all these activities and you’ve got some money saved up, maybe it’s time to expand the business.You could buy another field or two to increase your crop rotation, you could hire some workers so you don’t have to do everything yourself too.Another option might be to visit your friendly neighbourhood farming store and invest in some better machinery, your old tractor is having troubling pulling a full trailer up the hill to the silos after all.Farming FinancialsThe business tycoon element of the game is surprisingly comprehensive, the prices your produce will fetch at market will fluctuate, if a crop isn’t fetching a fair price you might be able to put it to a better use or store it in a silo and wait for the market to pick back up.The locals never run out of odd jobs for you to do either, these missions pay relatively well when you’re just starting out as long as you’ve got the right tools for the job.4XThat’s farming simulator in a nutshell. You work the land, tend your animals, chop down the trees and try to make some honest money.Money which you can then invest in more land and more animals to make even more money, which you’ll need to pay for the hired help and the extra machinery needed on your growing agricultural estate.You “Explore”, “Expand” and “Exploit” the land, just don’t mention “Exterminate”, it worries the cows.Escape to the CountrySo whether you want to enjoy the management side of the game, the free drive option of taking a tractor for a spin GTA style or just want an excuse to get up at the crack of dawn wearing nothing but wellingtons and a chequered shirt to watch the virtual sunrise with your animated cow friends, this game is for you!Farming Simulator 2015 is by far the best outing for the franchise and it really is an enjoyable, memorising game to play.Take a trip to the country, you’ll learn something and its fun!( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit http://www.review-well.com/ )			"

												The game is carried by mods. Pros - Runs good, never crashed and i've never had a problem with the game running on full settings.- Has potential that is not there right now. - Relaxing go at your own pace. - Lots of mods out there to make the game the way it should be.- Driving the tractors trailers and machines is fun :)- Lots of replay value WITH mods.Cons - No damage.- No tyre wear.- Not enough crops.- Not enough objectives .- Poor AI managment or multi tasking tools ( there is non ) you need courseplay and a whole bunch of other mods to get things going smoothly. - Animal husbandry is tragic , unrealistic and flat, no depth. - No watering of crops, animals don't need water all water related needs for running a farm is not present. - Hard mode to easy.- Mods are needed. - Maps are baron, no NPC's, all other fields that you do not own remain brown and desolate, untouched for 100's of hours before you may have enough to purchase them. They sit there and look ugly doing nothing. - Maps are lifeless, best part is waiting for sunrise and sunset to get some eye candy. - Poor economy .- You are able to drive over crops without damaging them.- Balance of manure, fertiliser, slurry out of whack. There is no balance or bonus to the 3 methods. - Missions are bland, only 3. Repetitive. - No failing, Crops don't fail, nothing can go wrong you also have the ability to turn off withering and trafic. - Taking out a 200,000 dollar loan does not cripple you. It's about 700 per day in repayment for how ever long you want. - You don't need to eat or drink.- Tractors never need a service instead you pay a daily upkeep fee on all your machines. - No penalty to keeping your tractors and machines out of the sheds. - No decent weather, no storms, no winds, no snow. - No replay value without MODS- Only 2 maps. - The game is not a simulator, it's far from being a simulator. It's more a ""Tractor"" Simulator. Not ""farm""All the cons can be fixed by mods, but your money does not go to the modders, it goes to the lazy devs. So thumbs down.			"

												For me, this is a very relaxing game.  Time flies when I am playing!  It is hard to convince someone who has never heard of Farming Simulator to want to buy it.  There is so much to do!  I think one of the biggest draws for me that keeps me playing it day after day is the fact that I can check modding sites for something new EVERY day!  I can even create my own maps (farms).  If you are tired of the super fast paced FPS's and just want to slow down a little, give Farming Simulator a try.  It's fun!!			"

												I have played this game daily for months and have gotten my money's worth many times over. It had a steep learning curve, and I needed lots of help from the internet to figure things out, but it was worth it. The countryside is beautifully rendered and relaxing to drive around in. Juggling the various tasks: planting, harvesting, taking care of animals, forestry, is fun and addicting. Now when I travel in the real world, I can identify various farm equipment and state of growth of fields. Highly recommended.			"

												If you really love simulations and love farming then look no futher FS15 has arived after playing every title from Giants I have to say this is the best....We have come a long way from FS08 and the graphics and detail and optimizations for all pcs has been outstanding...You can even run on a Intel HD3000. I myself run this game maxed out on a IntelHD4000 with a I7 processor and 8gb of RAM...but all in all it's a really great game Giants finally listened to thier fans with updated graphics, addition of forestry(which has been requested for 2 game titles now), washing of vehicles(most wanted feature),animated crops on equipment, more missions to complete to keep the avarage player busy with transport, grain hauls, and mowing...Looks like they went the extra mile and spent most of thier funding buying the needed rights to add new equimpent and I respect them for that....And the fact they left the mod converting 100% easy even for the newb of a player I give a A++ for the title...

												i bought this game to screw around  with silly vehicle physics for two hours and then refund it. I was convinced that anyone who likes this game is either stupid, boring, or both.Never in my life have i been so mistaken.I didn't want to like this game, but the quality of it is undeniable.I fell down the rabbit hole of  a deep and challenging agricultural simulation and  stayed for building up a growing farming business (pun intended)This game is well made. really well made. What makes this game great isn't just the farming stuff for autists who like to dig for potatos.there are criteria that define what makes a game a good game. these criteria apply to any game of  any genre. criteria like functional multiplayer, scalable challenges,  a responsive game world, deep and believable simulation, long time motivationsand this game aces most of them.you need to know your equipment, because you need the right machine for the right crop.you will need to  optimize your efficiency to stay afloat against increasing running costs. i love this part. many games that pretend to be an economic simulation turn into a virtual money creation machine real quick and lose all challenge.  but here, your tools and vehicles cost money every day whether you use them or not.you will need to exploit the market because prices fluctuate.

												Wonderful game, great way to relax and just play for a bit.  We honestly need more games that don't require a shot of expresso and no blinking to play.  The game itself is beautiful and the sounds and motions really do communicate the feel of being in those giant farming machines.  That said this is probably not a game for everyone, even with the business part of it to manage, you more or less must decide if driving a combine up and down a field for 30 minutes is fun.			"

												Why play Farming Simulator 15?I'm sure a lot of us who do play get asked that, or are recieved with blank expressions when we say we play this to our gamer friends.There are many answers, it's a relaxing, casual, no pressure, excellent sim experience. I hate to even call it a game.Sure, it can be gamed, by either trying to get the best equipment, become a millionaire, buy all the land in the village, have the best multi-player co-op, ect. None of which I have any interest in whatsoever. So why play?For me, it's one of the most relaxing offerings on Steam. A lot of times, after a hard day at work, or the morning of a day off, I just want to grab a cup of coffee, and relax. This game is perfect for that.As a chid I also spent my summers on my grandfather's farms, and to me that was truly the best times of my life. After they died the farmsteads were broken up among their children. Broken up to the point that they were no longer feasible farms.So in a way playing this is like going back to that moment in time where everything, in my eyes, was perfect Americana.Why do I play? Because, to me, this isn't really a ""game"" per se. It's a true life sim for those of us who remember or enjoy just firing up, grabbing a cup of coffee and relax with, even if it's just mowing that empty lot or watch the sun set or rise over a field of waving corn or wheat, the sound of roosters or the gentle heavy breathing of cattle chewing their cud.If anything, it saddens me when people CAN'T understand the draw and attraction of this ""game"".

												The 2015 version adds better graphics, couple new vehicles and the woodcutter add-on. Thats it. Nothing more, nothing less. The graphics really are much better. Both in quality as in detail (for example: tracks in the mud and tractors getting dirty). I would have liked it if they added more tycoon/business simulation features, a deeper career mode or more freedom in placing objects. Then it would have felt like a new game, now it feels more like a polished version of 2013/2014. Knowing that they sold over 2 million copies, i think they could have done more. Overall 7/10. I wouldn't really recommend buying the game if you already own a version of Farming Simulator. It feels too much of a cash cow. However, it is still a good game and by far the best Farming Simulator available. But i expect many will respond negative, because they expected more (and they well should, knowing that the game sold over 2 million times...).To sum things up:Pro's:- FS series are by far the best farming simulator games available- much better graphics then previous games, but don't expect AAA quality (but then again, you don't pay an AAA game price ;-))- new woodcutter add-on (which works very well and is a fun add-on)- some new vehiclesCon's:- gameplay and/or features havn't changed much compared to 2013 or 2014 version\for example:* not more maps then 2014 version* no business/tycoon features added* career mode is still very shallow* different interface, but still a bit clunky as it were in 2013Note: i havn't tested online mode for this review.

												For anyone who enjoys a simulator that gives you a variety of tasks with a payback this game is excellent. If you get the DLCs and some MODS you can pretty much work your farm either exactly like you want, or exactly like a specific level of farmer in the real world. One huge benefit is that when you have accumulated a lot of money you can actually farm with the huge automated equipment that modern big farmers are using today.  Or if you prefer you can find the equipment your father or in some cases grandfather might have had to farm with and see how they got along. Either way the possibility is there. What else could one ask from a computerized environment?			"

												One of those games that you think would be boring as♥♥♥♥♥♥ but turns out to blow your mind when you spend 8 straight hours farming a ♥♥♥♥ing wheat field. Really, really satisfying, and a great game to play while doing homework/another game that requires your attention (I play while playing Runescape). Controls for some of the logging machines are ♥♥♥♥ing cancer, but I guess it's supposed to be ""realistic"". Definitely worth getting if you love satisfying games where you progress to one upgrade to the next over extended periods of times, but be warned- if you are buying this to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with your friends and do not intend to take it seriously, you will not enjoy this game for more than a few hours. If on sale- its a must buy.Overall:Pros:-Addicting, satisfying gameplay that will last you for literal hours on end-Beautiful map-RelaxingCons:-Addicting, satisfying gameplay that will last you for literal hours on end-Not fun unless you actually want to take it seriouslyVerdict:8/10.

												Its an amazing game! If, like me, you are not an actual farmer or don't know a decent amount about real farming you may spend the first few hours wandering around gormlessly trying to understand the difference between hay, wheat, chaff, grass and a cow. Get past that though and its a fun game with some of the best modelled machines of any of the similar cost and quality simulators (Train, Euro Truck, not the comedy ones!) The little details like the machines getting dirty and doing so in a way that looks natural and leaving tyre tracks behind them also add to the immersion. Gameplay is slow (as it would and should be) but the ability to alter it on the fly in several different ways (time compression/plant growth rate/plant wilting rate) compensates that and limits the amount of time looking at a field full of immature wheat.Now I'm of to Wurzel!

												As a simulation fan who enjoys operating vehicles and building my own base step by step, I can definitely say that FS2015 provided what I was looking for. Having a great time with the sim and looking forward to the new release. =================================Pros- Huge variety of licensed, nicely modeled and multi-functional vehicles- Base building concept (=your farm)- AI workers- Variety of tasks - Very relaxing and calm envrionment. Farming is indeed an ideal profession for simulating.- Passionate and productive modding community (lots of new vehicles and maps)- An ideal simulation for multiplayer- Support for multiple controllers (I use logitech G27 wheel + Extreme 3D pro combo)=================================Cons- Lack of TrackIR support- No Steam Workshop support- Sim development is slow. Community is doing a great job with vehicles. Developer should focus more on significant game additions. For example mud physics/suspensions is a MUST. If it is difficult for MP, then it must be done for SP (Spintires is a great example).- Needs bigger maps and better graphics - Also needs more objects/functions to develop your own farm - Lack of high quality ambience elements (workers, active farms/fields operated by AI, people, traffic, etc). Maps feel empty/deserted (Living cities and envrioenment in GTAV is a great example. It may be very difficult to reach this level but any improvement in this area would be welcome)=================================Media- Screenshots =================================Edit 1My reply to  People Actually Play This? Although farming is the main theme in FS, you dont have to be in love with farms to enjoy this game. FS is a really good vehicle simulation. So if you enjoy driving and operating vehicles, you`ll most probably enjoy FS a lot since it also gives you many options to do so. On top of this, add base building and management layer as well. FS allows you to build your own combination of vehicle/implement fleet around specific types of activities you wish to focus. Therefore every single person posting here has a different farming experience. There are more than one way to do the same thing ! Initially FS looks very simple and plain but underneath, it is a rich, complex and rewarding experience. In an age of endless combat/violence/crime games, FS is a much needed digital heaven.			"

												This new entry from Giants Software (makers of FS '13) is a HUGE improvement from the previous Farming Simulator. The graphics have improved and things look more realistic. For example, harvesting grain looks like grain and where you position the trailer lets the product build up in that part of the trailer before spreading out. Another example is that you can see the tire tracks on the ground, which is awesome. Another improvement is physics. The last game you could easily flip things over, but in this there is more weight and you can even feel a fully loaded trailer struggling to go up a hill. There are more vehicles, like a semi truck and forestry equipment, and more things to do, like cutting down trees with a chainsaw. You do have two maps to play as well, so there's more possibilities. Of course this game is fully moddable so there's even more trucks, tractors, and equipment to get for the game! I would recommend this game if you like farming sims. Trust me, this is quite the improvement from '13.			"

												Game is much upgraded according to LS13, and the patch before release say that the game, even bugged, will be polished by GIANTS and not ever left alone. I think they'll fix most of the bugs after release of the console version, I think they're now focused on it. Making easier modding is big + for GIANTS, it will allow other players to make ever more and even better things for LS15.New graphics engine, with polished psyhics is what we all needed. The game also plays smoothier on most of PCs. All say there are some problems with starting(like black-white bug etc.), but it's not GIANTS problem, it's your problem, players! I had same on my old(8+ yr) laptop, but I went to Farming Simulator page, there's a nice FAQ with solution for most of the problems. They said to upgrade graphics card drivers, and I did it, and it worked! The game on this laptop plays smoothier than LS13, even on medium 1220x900.Thank you developers!			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is an ok game. The gameplay is credible. The physics are very much incredible. Although the person who designed the physics lives on the moon it is a rather good game. It is (except forestry) well balanced and enjoyable to a farming enthusiast. If you are willing to buy the game for it's multiplayer. Don't. You have to have friends who are willing to play for a fun multiplayer. The graphics have been improved to a high level from Farming Simulator 2013 and the content with it. The map feels small if you are driving across it at high speed. You'd probably be able to fly where you want to go with the physics. The forestry feature is OK to some extent. Trees never fall the way you want them and sometimes glitch and either fall into the ground or fire off into the stratosphere. (I have had both events occur in 24 hours of gameplay.) If you were to go straight into forestry and ignore the farming aspect of the game it would be a rather short and easy experience as you get 6x the amount of money for 2 hours of forestry than you would for 2 hours of farming. The farming aspect is almost the same as 2013; the same plants to grow, same method but with a couple new harvesters and many new tractors. The livestock feature also seems to be exactly copied over. A couple of the other new features include: tyre tracks that will follow exactly where your vehicle has been and dirt, your tractors may get dirty and grubby, but you are able to wash them with a power washer that costs £4,500. In the options, there aren't many. Although you can reset the key bindings for every key, but by default they are all the same as Farming Simulator 2013's which is a nice touch. Overall I think it is a good game and I would recommend it. If you ignore the physics and the small map then it is quite a good game. If you are unsure about getting Farming Simulator 15, buy 2013 first as it is cheaper and the only real difference is forestry. Everything else is cosmetic. SolaR			"

You then move on to harvesting the crop and finally selling it. The Hire feature is very nice once you progress in the game and have many fields growing and being harvested. It then becomes a time management issue to make sure you are plowing, sowing and harvesting in succession. If you get too many things going at once you'll end up with dead fields that are worthless. You then have to replant them and start over. The game is a huge time sink. You'll eventually be tempted to harvest trees. It can be very lucrative. Watch out though, it can ruin the game IMHO.			"

												I don't know why, but I really do enjoy this game. Im one of those guys who likes sim games, I hace ETS 2 as well as ATS.  Some thing about making money,working hard to purchase new equipment, planting sweet crops and eventually just becoming a millionaire. Theres so much in this game to do. Ive stuck to crops mainly, havent got to forestry and livestock or anything yet. Only thing I don't really like is hired help, how they can miss portions of your fields if your field isnt exactly square ill say.  So im kinda in the process of figuring out where to start on each field so I dont have to keep an eye on them and just do my own thing. I can't believe ive spent 50hours on this game already. I played about 40 hours of it and figured out I dont like the way I pursued certain equipment without really looking over the details of the equipment and what kind of power you need to run things. So im like, forget it, now I know more about the game.....after 40 hours of playing it. So I completely started my game over and its still been very enjoyable redoing a lot of what I already did. I really like this game and highly recommend this game to people who like sim games, like relaxing/kicking back and are willing to basically put a LOT of time into this game. Overall, great purchase, im sure FS 17 will be more awesome. "

												Fun game overall, was fun to play but it has some major flaws that kinda ruin the ""feeling of progression"".My main problem with the game is that, AS SOON you start invest your money on forest industry you have beaten the game. Upgrade to the very best in forest industry and you basicially never have to do anything else, you are set-for-life with money if you are effective enough doing it. Usually what that means is that you chop down the very big trees, pull/lift them to the sawmill, get rewarded big.Another problem is that you will figure out that Canola is the most profitable (when it's a wanted product). You can just grow Canola on all your fields, get a trailer and just stock up on it untill the businesses want more money for it, then you can also cash out big.In FS13 the hint was to just mow grass with lawnmowers, 11k per mission which could trigger realisticly frequent. In this game that is not the case, that i approve. But instead you can just pump forest industry and then you eliminate most of the entire game's purpose due to just chop down trees.In the end me and my friend who played it for 50-60 hours or so figured that you dont have to do anything in the game with farming. Sell your stuff, go strong in forest industry since it will be 100x times more rewarding then ploughing a field, cultivating a field, seeding a field, fertilizing a field > wait > harvest.It's a huge shame, economy should be a key in this game, and for me it felt completely unaccurate and non realistic.I would recommend this game for others, if the economy in this game would be balanced. Since that would then be a cycle like this:Work hard > put back into your work and time > get rewarded > open up more fields, buy cattle > expand and start from point one > get more rewarded.Now it's like thisSell tractors, buy forest industry vehicles (for starters, a chainsaw and something heavy to push the trees are enough) > get rewarded faster then cycle one > upgrade to best forest industry vechicles > have plently of cash left > ask yourself ""Why would i spend it on farming industry since it's no point doing it now when i got so much money?"" > You beaten the game.I had a good time in this game, but frankly - it's too easy and unbalanced. Hopefully it will become better in the future with FS16-FS17 or so.And yes, me and my friend played it on Hard. Was a piece of a cake.			"

												This is a brilliant game if you have even the slightest interest in farming or tractors or anything of that kind. It is not possible to say ""I'll just play it for an hour or so"" because when you start you will end up playing for 5 or 6 hours at a time. Very good game and I would recommend.			"

												As you can see, I've played this game a lot, like a lot.  I rarely do this with games for the sole reason that I get bored.  Farming Simulator 2015 has yet to bore me, it has dull moments, but when I get through those moments, the game is interesting again.Pros-Forestry-Many things to accomplish-Great graphics on certain maps and vehicles (at high)-Many MODs and Maps (not as many as FS13)-Variety of vehicles-Various routes to make money, most of them different -Sounds-Dirt build up on vehiclesCons-Limited content in DLCs-Lack of vanilla vehicles-Modding community -Graphics in vanilla game-AI is terribleThings to add to imprive the overall game:-Seasons-Digging and terraforming-Better DLCs-More crop typesNow don't get me wrong when I mention the CONs, and things to add.  No game is perfect, none.  I like this game for the laid-back no sense of responsibility that is difficult to get in other games. 10/10 "

												Very nice game. I like that they added forestry. It adds something fun to do while waiting for crops to grow. Also, physics have been modified and are much more better than FS2013. I like the fact my tractor is rushing while I'm driving up a hill with a full trailer of wheat. Much more interesting than in FS2013 where you could go everywhere at top speed no matter what the tractor was pulling. The game needs alot improvement to be considered a real powerful simulator but Giant made a real step forward. We can feel their motivation to truely improve the game and not just release a new cash ""grabber"".Add to this there is alot of FREE mods to customize the game. Very useful considering some vehicles in game are not always very smartly designed. For example, you can't load the wood trailer with a frond loader cuz trailler is too high. That's just dumb. You can only do it with telehandler. And you can only grab one trunck at time. So it takes incredible amount of time to load the trailer with wood. But some mods were designed to fix that issue and help players being more efficient. So well. I guess there is a mod to fix almost all those annoying ""bugs"". So overall, a game I recommend if you enjoyed FS2013 or just enjoy farming sim. This is the best farming sim I played so far. Just waiting for DLCS to get onsale to get them all! :P Happy farming folks!			"

												I've played farming simulator since FS2011 and I really have enjoyed playing both 2011 and 2013, now it's FS2015 and a lot of things has been improved. Graphics has been improved, physics has been improved so there are difference in how much load different tractors can pull. also when going uphill the speed the tractor can is slower, logging / forestry is now a part of the game and a lot of fun at least after the latest patch.. Pros: Good handlingNice graphicsMany MachinesImproved physicsMultiplayer + Dedicated server Huge modding communityCons:There are still some minor bugs awaiting to be patchedChanging the ""time compression"" while sowing causes the fields to grow ""uneven"".No possiblility to changes keymapping while playing it can be frustrating to exit to main menu, and load the savegame over and over till you are happy with your bindings..Some of the great machines from FS2013 has not made it to FS2015 (Maybe saved for upcomming DLC's ?)Chance of being teased teased by your friends / collegues for playing it :)I don't really have any concerns which affects why one not should buy the game, just minor issues that can seem frustrating at times..Buy the game but be aware that it's very addicting and you can easily spent 100 hours plus on playing this game ;) "

												The last Farming Simulator I had was Farming Simulator 13. Without a doubt in my mind this game is a big step up. Logging is freaking awesome. I went into the buy menu (P) and saw that you could buy chainsaws but I didn't know that with these chainsaws you could chop down trees haha.Also with the addition of cars and a few other new things to me I would say that buying this game was well worth it!

												A great game to play! The UI is very intuitive, the gameplay is fun, and it's a great way to lose yourself in a game.

												Whilst it takes a few hours to get to grips with all of its functions, Farming Simulator 15 is fantastic fun, particularly in multiplayer.I've spend the majority of my time crop harvesting with a dabble of animal husbandry, I've hardly touched the forestry aspect. In short, it will demand a lot of your time, but it is definitely worth it.Get the Gold Edition if you can, as the added maps and tractors are reccomended "

I mean you can touch every button on your machine.  But the game is a peaceful quiet game where you can actually be a farmer. Which is nice. The game runs great but with a few lags but that's because my Notebook doesn't have top-end graphics...The game lets you do what ever you want in farming with no goals...So my point here is that I recommend this game to anyone who wants to be a farmer but doesn't want to get there hands dirty! 100% love it!!!

												Here on my farm, just bought this new Lamborghini Mach 230 VRT here. It’s fun to drive up here in the Sosnovka marshes. But you know what I like more than tractors? Cows. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these 50 new hay bales that I had to get an Ursus T-127 to hold until I mix them with the silage and straw. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you sow, the more you grow.”Now maybe you’ve seen my tedder talk where I talk about how I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day. You know, I dry and windrow 17 cubic miles of grass every day not to show off, again it's about the cows. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini Mach 230 VRT here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little farmstead across the map driving a tiny little Sampo Rosenlew Comia C6 with only 185 horsepower. I didn't even have any chickens. I had no opportunities.			"

I've spent 30 hours in game already and have barley scratched the surface. This is a huge improvment over all other FS games. If you want farming then this is for you! If you don't find this gameplay type as much fun after a few hours of playing then you need to try playing in multiplayer on a 24/7 dedicated server with other players. That is where this game really shines. I love all the new brands, the improved graphics/physics engine, and most of all the new map with forestry! $30 well spent! GunninGamerz on Youtube/Twitch			"

They have improved just about everything in the game, from the way improved graphics, to the way easier to use interface makes this a much more relaxed and easy to use experence. If you just wana sit back do alot of mundane stuff, be well rewarded, and learn basic farming, on your time and pace. Then this is a great place to start. This is not COD, the most action you will see is rain. Wana play fast and hard, Look somewhere else. This is a great ZEN type game you can both learn from and just enjoy. This little company has out done itself and this is a very good game/sim.			"

												While I loved FS2013 and earliers, FS15 has gone above and beyond my expectations. They have made an impressive upgrade to the graphics from previous generations including tire dirt trails from historical driving, mud/dirt on vehicles from excessive use, to higher models and textures for the vehicles/plants. PROS:-Upgraded graphics from previous versions-New lumber farming that allows you to experience a new type of farming-Runs incredibly smoothly without being very intensive-Great fun with friendsCONS:-Crane game style controls for lumber tend to reward you the same way that arcade crane games reward you-Rubberbanding effect on multiplayer-Different overview that isn't very user friendly, takes a while to get used to for new or returning players-Don't forget your hotkeys (can't view them without going to main -AI seems to be a bit wonky, sometimes hiccups and doesnt plant for 2feet causing barcode-like fields (not sure if game or multiplayer issue)Most of these cons aren't actually bad to the game, but minor annoyances that I have experienced throughout the day.

												Ok, so it's a farming game.  Big deal.  And then you try it - and I mean give it an honest shot of more than maybe a couple hours.  Next thing you realize is it isn't so much the graphics, which are decent in my opinion, or the equipment, or even the mods.  It becomes a thinking game - how to maximize your harvests, field and equipement management, cash flow, and more importantly - time management.   I find the need to sit back and prioritize what I am doing, and what purchases to make next take more of my concentration than actually working the fields.   Once I have a farm/map in a self sufficient state, usually by owning all of the property and sufficient equipment resources to manage it plus a substantial bank account, I typically call the game ""won"" and move on to the next map/challenge.  If you are finding the basic challenge of the game too easy, set a personal challenge such as only using a specific brand, or limiting yourself to a certain size of tractor.  The possibilities here are endless and can breathe new life into a new game.I have to give all the map and modder community the credit they are due.  Having tried my hand at generating even a simple map, it brings into focus the amount of time, and a certain degree of programming skills, necessary to create and publish these works.  My hat is off to you guys.  While the basic game is very much playable, and for the most part enjoyable, the ease of which additional features, tools, and equipment/tractors can be quickly added is a pleasant change.  Simply drop a zip file in a folder, start the game, and go.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who just wants to sit back and play at your own pace.  There are no finish lines, no objectives (other than the ones you set yourself), and no adrenaline rushes.  About the only thing you could be accused of is being a 'cereal' killer. ;)Oh, and as for an addiction level, I think my gaming time speaks for itself.Happy Farming. :)			"

												Seems silly, I know...But I've played the crap out of this thing since I got it.  This ain't Farmville.  For some reason, I can't stop playing and contemplating my next upgrade.  Bigger tipper trailer?  Stronger tractor?  Hay baler?  Best part of the game is the vibrant mod community around it...there's a lot of people able to put amazing amounts of time into creating new vehicles, gorgeous maps and helpful mods.  Base game too easy?  There's a mod that goes into full soil pH, moisture, nutrients and other factors.  Put on your overalls and get dirty.			"

												Farming simulator is a very good game if you like to virtually farm! There is not many bugs within the game and when one comes up they are fixed pretty quickly. The in game maps and tractors do get boring quickly but if you search for mods on google and there is a lot of mod sites that have a lot of mods. Because the developers allow there games to be easily moded therefore there is a really strong and good modding community therefore you will never get bored of this game. This is because you can just go and download a new map and then a whole new adventure begins. If you are into simulators and looking for new ones to try I would recommend this game and also if you are interested in farming but like to play video games I also recommend this game for you.			"

												Farming Simulator 15. After a long wait, it's finally here. While the basic gameplay remains the same from previous versions, the graphical updates are truly stunning. Dirt shaders, and particle systems are among the game's crowning achivements. The upgraded physics shine as well as now you must carefully match your equipment's power tp the implements. The included maps are very nice although the inclusion of Westbridge Hills from the FS 2013 Titanium Addon is a bit disapointing. The new map Bjornholm is great and features many variations of field size and terrian. The addtion of forestry is a major part of this game's early succsess, although the actual mechanics of forestry are a bit buggy. The equipment is properly massive and very impressive in look and function. Gamers familiar with FS 2013 should be able to jump right in and play without any problems as the basic controls have remained the same. Steering Wheel/Gamepad users should be aware of a bug with key bindings in which ALL functions must be mapped or the game will not load. Overall this is a fantastic upgrade to an already great franchise and should take it's place on the top of the heap of simulation games.			"

												Having grown up in the farming community of Western Kentucky and working on both large and small farms in my youth, this game holds a certain nostalgic quality for me on a personal level. I have experienced the reality of working with farm equipment and thus have a deeper appreciation for the real word mechanics and scenarios this game is designed to mimic. The simplest way I can describe this game is that it is the virtual equivalent to playing with Tonka toys in the dirt, as so many have done in their youth.The game mechanics do a great job of recreating the real world life of working on a large farm with massive equipment and machines. Alone it is worth the purchase; however there is a modding community that has done some amazing work in expanding this game beyond the simple planting, growing, and cultivating the harvest of crops. Mods have brought more aspects of the agricultural industry into the game, with additions such as expanded greenhouse growing, orchards, and livestock. There are even mods that require the player to manage the chemical composition of the soil itself in order to optimize crop yields. In addition, mods have made it easier for single player gameplay to expand beyond the simple asynchronous list of jobs to be done to a more concurrent task switching game that one could experience with multiplayer/online gameplay. This in turn allows the size and the scope of the game scenario to expand for single players. In addition there are some fantastic maps available that can allow the player to experience the familiar surroundings of the region in which they live, or to play through scenarios that are the reality of farming in other parts of the world. This adds repeat gameplay opportunity to the game thus giving greater equity in the purchase. Free mods, maps, and additional equipment downloads also make the game extremely customizable and allows one to tailor the game to be more or less challenging in order to suit each individuals gameplay preferences.From and educational stand point, the game does a lot to help one better understand the underappreciated agricultural industry of the independent farmer, and to fully experience all the work that goes into growing and bringing to our tables the food we sit down to eat each day. We often take for granted that the grocery store does not have a magical machine in the back making the box of cereal or the milk we so conveniently acquire.The game play is slow with a steep learning curve when modded, but, in my opinion, is well worth the time to play. I highly recommend the game to sim game fans and those who like a more relaxing game play experience. Nothing is going to kill, shoot, chase, or eat you in this game. It is simply playing in the dirt on a big♥♥♥♥♥tractor! "

												Every version of farm sim is better than the last so far, The addition of dirt and such really adds a lot, Back in FS13 I always said how it needed dirt, now it does, So I'm pacifiedalthough my time is deceptive in this game (I often fall asleep and forget the game is running in the background, So there's probably a good 40 hours ow extra time there) I still keep coming back to it like some kind of addictive hobby, I don't see it as a regular game but something more relaxing, sit down put on some country radio and start up farm sim.So yeah, Got the game, All the DLC and I would recommend this to anybody who enjoys relaxing simulations, I think it works just right without being too realistic to be tedious.And to think I played FS2011 as a joke, I've been a boring sim nerd ever since.

												Edited AFTER beta patch 1.3b to a ""Thumbs up"".The long list of changes included in patch 1.3b addressed literally all of my technical issues with the game.Though since starting a new map I still haven't been able to fully test the forestry fix(es) due to lack of in game money, so far.This of course didn't repair my corrupted save, but I have since found a beautiful free mod map ""Old Ridge Farm"" that both suits my personality and sense of aesthetics, so starting again has been as good as a holiday, (that new car smell).Selectively adding suitable ""quality of life"" mods to the game from a smorgasbord of high quality free mod sites, has tailored the game to how I want to play Farming Simulator (2015).I don't have much experience with game modders, but I am impressed by both the quality and quantity of mods available for this game.I now practice a very strict backup process for my save folder every night, but the game is exceptionally stable ( except ONCE, which was devastating).Buy this game, except if you are time poor, and even then, strongly consider getting this game.Original:I love this game, there are no win conditions, no artificial restrictions for you to unlock, no leveling up, no end game.If you can afford the equipment (and the daily maintenance), you can buy it for your farm.There are no ""best"" or ""end game"" equipment, just equipment that is better suited to what you doing, or your preferred way of doing it.  Most of my farm purchases were based on budgeting and economics rather than stats.This is the game I play just to relax, and enjoy myself.Everything is SO detailed, the lighting, the models, the animations, the weather, the day and night cycles.It is the attention to detail that keeps me entertained while I am harvesting a paddock.The game appears to be very well optimized as my aging GPU doesn't have any problems in providing a very smooth framerate.The tutorial is probably the best one I have seen for being short, sweet, and to the point, so you can get on with the game.The Modding community, and the quality of the mods for this game is huge.  My ONLY complaint, and it is a BIG one, is that trying to expand my farming into the much advertized FORESTRY, the game crashes with the unfortunate habit of deleting all the current save game files (XML's). My current save has, or rather, had over 100 hrs invested in it.  I was able to retrieve an autosave backup, with only a hour or so lost, however continuing to plant more saplings caused the game to crash and delete the save files again losing a few more hours work.Considering the amount of precious time invested, this to me is unacceptable. Losing three hours is the same as losing an entire gaming night.Despite my love of this game, I can't recommend this game until such an important feature, is fixed, and I personally hope it is fixed soon.

Product received for free
												Farming Simulator 15. There is a lot of good and a lot of bad, lets start with the good.Pros Really easy to learn, Tutorial is really useful for learning the basics Online multiplayer is really nice and well made, not had any bugs or random disconnects gameplay in general is really open and smooth, you are not forced to do anything Can hire workers to automate many tasks Many mods that can improve the game or just fun to fool around with Cons Can be a bit overwhelming when starting, Farming, animals and forestry, so much that you dont know where to start If joining an online session it always starts you at the main building with no money even if you have played on that world/server before Only 2 maps (unless you have the Gold Edition) Takes a while to get into the game (A large ammount of repetitive work that gets boring) the game sometimes does not understand what you are trying to do (trying to cut off small tree branches only to find you cut the tree in half)Overall Farming Simulator 15 has a lot that works and a lot that does not. the implementation of an online mode was a welcome addition and the expansion of jobs that can be done makes the game more interesting. While yes i will say that the game has many problems I feel that these can be overlooked as, with experience and time, you can overcome these limitations.My review 7.5/10			"

												Farming Simulator 2015 is an extrordinary game. From growing crops to ramming in to the general populous' cars, I have never played such a diverse game in my lifetime. One could also say that this game has a soothing tone to it unless, of  course, you reach bankruptcy. All in all I formally rate this spectacular game 9/10. (Could have better graphics but never expected much from a siumulator about farming.)			"

												If you're into a simulator-style game, in particular - farming, then this game is pretty decent. I cannot compare it to any other farming simulator game, except my Farmville on FB habit of like 6 years ago, that said I've spent a fair amount of time on this game. The re-playability is sort of there. Mod/addon websites exist so you can important additional tractors and attachments beyond the default items in the game, and those imported items are what added to the additional playtime. The game also only comes with 2 maps, and even though they are big, you do get tired of them, which is where importing additional maps comes in. All in all, if you're someone who is comfortable using 3rd party sites, and downloading mod-packs and such to improve a game's playability, then this game can be a lot of fun. The base playability in itself only lends 10-20 hours of game time unless you're someone who becomes addicted to it via some way or another - my way was downloading mod packs and such.			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is an amazing addition to the Farming Simulator franchise. Whether you are new to the games or not, this adds a new level of gameplay with the addition of forestry, which was only available as a mod for FS 2013. New brands of machinery further extend the hours of fun you will have ploughing, cultivating, sowing, spraying, harvesting, etc.			"

												Sometimes I just want to create without worrying about dragons, super-mutants, orcs, or hostile civilizations attacking me.  That's when I play this game.  I have about 200 hours in this game (mostly offline which means STEAM isn't aware).  If you like mowing the lawn or playing a merchant this game could be for you.  You get a sense of accomplishment and your choices DO make a difference.  Compared to FPS and RPGs, it's a bit slow and if you're used to playing Bethesda games the playing space is ludicrously small, but it's still fun to build up a farming empire by slowly buying up all the land available and making it productive.  Instead of guns and potions you collect tractors and attachments, your missions don't involve going somewhere and killing everything in sight but instead you deliver farm goods or services to meet contract schedules, or to suit yourself.  There's a huge focus on money but crafting, fighting, exploring, looting, and levelling up aren't a part of this game.  Your character gets wealthy but never advances in capabilities or perks.  It's easy to watch TV or do some other intermittant activity while the game is running, close attention is infrequently required.    It's a nice change from what I normally play.   Recommended.			"

												Aside from the wood chipper being a bit tempermental to use, very interesting game. It leaves you with a lot of options to go to try out new things and make more money. Multiplayer is probably the best part about this game being able to complete the game a lot more easily than constantly hiring AI and having to check on everything yourself. Physics are  somewhat unrealistic but you can still find ways to mess around and have fun with those physics. Very good game.			"

												I love Farming Simulator 2013 and so I really want to love FS15.  And there are things to really love about this game, especially the attention to graphical detail.  This is a much 'prettier' game than FS13, no question.  Given how much time and money they obviously spent on the aesthetics of this game, I'm forced to shake my head on how they managed to so completely screw up the physics, the most fundamental gameplay element.  The trucks slide around corners like they're greased in buttermilk.  The tractors and wagons act like Bambi first walking across the frozen pond behind Thumper. The whole game feels like an extended viewing of Olympic ice dancing and I half expect a French judge to give me a '6' on my routine.  I guess part of the issue is that I came from FS2013 using the More Realistic mod which, combined with the Soil Management Mod, actually caused FS2013 to approach the status of 'simulator'.  But this is just a huge step backward.  I can only beg them to quickly release a patch to both restore the physics to the FS2013 standard or, at the very least, release the Developer specs so that those more intelligent than I can do it themselves.  It's just a travesty that they haven't fixed this yet and I check my steam account every night waiting for them to finally get off their butts and fix this game.  As it stands I won't even let my 7 year old son play it, I just point him toward fs2013.  ""The game is still broken and it's not worth the aggravation, son.""  When the physics is fixed this game has the potential to far exceed the experience of older FS versions (and any other farming simulator).  Right now it feels like a half-baked developer version.

												I do not recommend this game because of the following reasons: -The workers AI has barely improved if any. They still hit everything at the end of the fields.-They (the developers) still put stuff at the end of fields for workers to hit. I hoped they would've learned this by now.-Cutting logs was a mod in the previous version, so nothing in the game is new. Though logging is slightly improved.-Crops growing is not a fluent process just 4-5 different stages (like previous versions) , i was hoping for a fluent grow cycle by now.-Washing tractors and such is the same as the growth: just a couple of stages of dirt on the tractors and etc.-Crops still clip through tractor.-Some Equipment that was present in previous version is not here now. -Forestry is annoying with the physics in this game.-Physics in this game are still extremely unrealistic at times (Tokyo drift got nothing on some of the tractors in this game).-Collisions with vehicles are extremely unrealistic. -Night isn't really night. Again same as previous version.-Developers are really silent IMO even though there's a large community behind this game. -Some bugs that should've been solved with some testing. In short: the game hasn't improved enough to merit a positive review or to recommend it especially if you played the previous versions. You're paying for a game with slightly better graphics and a different HUD. If you're still in doubt don't buy it unless it's on sale.			"

												My opinion on this game is kinda mixed. I got a bit disappointed since it feels more as a DLC then a new game. Cons:- There is only 1 new map since the US map was from the last FS2013 DLC- Really bad driving physics- The skybox looks like crap (No moving clouds and static night skybox f.ex)- No improvement in the grapichs department- Cockpitview badly detailed and blurred out- A tad to easy to earn money if you go for only loggingPros:- Some new equipment- Nicely detailed tractors/equipment- New stuff to do due to the added logging equipment etc- The new Scandinavian map feels bigger- Weight counts in when transporting stuff- Equipment draw horsepowers from the tractors so a weak tractor cant use f.ex a mower and a trailer to pick it up at the same time. Adds more realism that way.- Much better and minimalistic UI :)All in all its a perfectly good game for the people who never tried FS2013.For the ""veterans"" from FS2013 its gonna be a bit disappointed. But since the price aint that high its worth it if you pretend its just a DLC :P			"

												Play it with friends.Muddy up farm machinery.Step on chicken eggs.It does lack smoking hot ♥♥♥♥♥es, but other than that it's genuinely a good game. Probably very slow paced in single player but with some clueless teammates, it's a lot more fun than it may appear.Recommended because it's a good simulator with an absolute load of machines you never knew existed and plenty of things to try and do. Above all, it's actually fun. Maybe not as good as Euro Truck Simulator 2, but both aim at a very small target and hit it beautifully.EDITIt doesn't have a very good tutorial. New players get confused about how to do some of the basic things such as switch between vehicles or how to work their new farm. That's pretty essential for the game that is first and foremost about farming. The few tutorials show several stages of crop production but leave a lot unexplained.Pacing of the game is a bit slow unless timewarp is used. Even then the game fall into the trap of making life miserably difficult early on, only to make it easier and easier as the player progresses. Basically, as you earn more money, you can invest in better machinery that can increase yield and work more of the land, which means as you become more succesful, there is less and less to do except organise your hired hands.To break up the monotony, there is much to experiment with and learn. Some very specialised machinery exists and since it's pricey, it will offer something to spend money on. Then there is tending to animals or growing more complicated crops. The nice thing is that all of this can be attempted at the player's own initiative. You're never forced to do anything you don't like.Moving the lawns or cutting down trees is more removed from working fields and is implemented very well. Forestry equipment alone is simulated very well.It takes time to derive pleasure from this Farming Simulator, but the fun is definitely there. You'll have to work and figure out what to do with your initially limited cash flow in order to explore all the branches available. When it all falls into place, it feels quite nice.Now multiplayer is something else. Teamwork really speeds things up and is a great source of both comedy and confusion. Oh and the innuendo potential is enormous with all the ploughing and seed and log jams. The only downside to multiplayer is that it's not very easy to get enough friends at the same time, and it is a bit time consuming but when it happens it's a lot of fun.			"

												Great new changes from last version and a close call to say is it better than FS13, short answear is no, its missing to much that out weights the gains to a new engine with all FS13 current DLCs (not including mods).What I love in this new version:Machines getting dirty and you can cleanTrailer grain fill levels  filling up at different levels depending on where it is being filledCrisp, clean interface that scales with display, looks great at 1900x1200 or 5730X1200Chopping trees down with a chainsaw and selling or chippingDirt tracks on groundOverall partical effects like smoke and fogShop menu now neat and cleanLarge map overlay that pops down to a mini mapworkers can now fertilise crops What I miss:Machines missing, at least they could have added more of the FS13 DLCsField autionsHerb gardenCrashing into cars, now its like hitting brick walls that will not moveBetter American map, current imported version has the wrong grass and dirt, missing forest ground details and no gold coins.Better selection of machines that scale up in price and roles, what is in FS15 does not scale like other versionsWhat i would like:More crops for seed or rootAt least some progress with the animals otherwise you might as well call this ""Vegetarian Woodcutter Simulator 15""Different levels of growth yield depending on type, like liquid fertiliser costs more but least yeild compired to solid manure is free and best yeild.  At the moment its all 100% yield gain. silly and lazy.Manual ignition for tractorsLights staying on with machines I leave to another machine.Main information menu remembering which screen I was on last I checked.Forest/trees you should harvest and growth levels on map, like the current growth information screenMore machinesand even more machines just to be sure10/10 "

												Buckle up for some good-ol', full-throttle action racing between two AI controlled pieces of farm equipment in parallel fields.  Farms will strike without warning and tractors use clever disguises, tactical espionage and acrobatic martial arts to ensure a successful bailing experience.  Choose from a barn full of smokin' rod tractors and harvesters and quickly level up your fields.  Players will need to decide between equipment and their useful ""attachments"" depending upon their unique skill sets.Anything goes in this highly competitive, totally wild, all-out, all-star farming extravaganza, as it offers a freestyle game approach, focused on fast and furious rounds, where you step into the game as your favorite tractor.Climb behind the trigger and help our distressed farmer friend obliterate hordes of no good cluckers!11/10 - No orange honeycomb textures.

												One of the best simulation games ever made.  The tractors, vehicles are authentic and realistic.  The scenery is beautiful and memorable to explore.  The financial elements are just the right combination of simplistic and complex to keep the game fun without being a burden to manage, keeping you engaged in the core elements of the game.  Add in multiplayer, husbandry and logging, and you have a game that will keep you playing for hundreds of hours.Pros:Beautiful landscapePeaceful ambient soundsAuthentic tractors, vehicles and equipmentHusbandryLoggingFarmingMultiplayerHire employees to harvest, sow and fertilize fieldsCons:NPC vehicles get in the way (can be turned off in settings)Hired employees' AI is lackingHorns on tractors - all are this little squeak of a hornLogging forks - have to wrestle with logs at timesRepetitive (farming is repetitive, so not really a con)			"

												I Don't have much time on this game as most people do but I have played alot on the console version. For a take on an agricultural theme I would say they did very well it goes fairly in depth to the aspects of farming but there is also a modding side to this game and it can go from people who take farming very seriously to people who don't care and make outrageous mods but it depends on your mood for that day. Overall I would say this game is definetly worth buying			"

Posted: November 7, 2014
												In short, FS15 is better/improved in every way to any of its predecessors, therefore I recommend the game (overall rating 7/10).Physics (6/10): They say its a new engine, however it does feel a lot like the old one in many ways, but some major improvements like not so ""floaty"" objects (tractors still go airborn when driving over small hills at 30 km/h though), solid AI vehicles and the machines actually loosing speed when going uphill and gaining speed going downhill are some VERY good improvements.It still has the ""bouncy"" physics which for some parts doesn't matter but for other parts are downright annoying and makes the game hard to actually play sometimes.There're some sort of ""magnet"" feature that steps in to aid the player in placing things like the scorpion king cutter by the tree so u don't have to be 100% precise with that.Also when grinding trunks the same thing happens when u place logs on the conveyer belt and the end of the log comes close to the grinder unit.Sometimes you feel the ""magnet"" feature works for you, while other times it seems to work straight against you.Due to the physics engine, log handling is very frustrating at times, somewhere around 50% of the time actually and things like the grinder than tends to bounce the logs all over the place are truly annoying, especially as once the end of a log bounces higher than the grinding unit and back down, the grinder no longer treats it as if its for grinding, it kinda ignores it somehow and the log will just lie there on the moving conveyer belt without being affected by it.Controls (5/10): Im using an XBOX One controller via USB and FS15 is prepared for that, it even has some default controller scheme for it that works pretty bad, because none of the machines are controlled like you'd expect them to, for starters, the wheel loader has the arm up/down set in a way so u cant drive and steer while controlling the arm.If u reconfigure the controls, then you cant set it up so the controls are correct for all machines and that's due to the way the controls are tied together, so if u set the wheel loader so the right stick controls the arm and bucket (like on a real wheel loader), your controls for cranes will become wrong and vise versa.Gameplay (8/10): The machines way of deploying power is way better than in older FS games, so far I haven't experienced the scenario of a smaller tractor being more powerful than a bigger (higher HP) tractor, so now it actually pays to buy the tractor suitable for the given job, instead of just finding that one tractor that does it all better than any other tractor.The logging part they added is nice, because it offers you to take a break when you get fed up by the repetitiveness of sowing and harvesting and you also makes so that you can do some logging during harvest so that you wont just sit around watching the hired worker fill up the harvester.They also added the ""no withering"" option so when enabled, your crops wont wither and that makes it possible to actually have several fields and maintain them all without the risk of loosing the crop if not harvested in time.In addition, it doesn't force you to attend to those fields until you feel like it.Stability (8/10): I find the game to be VERY stable, ive had one crash only so far and that's after the game has been running for days where Ive played up to 8 hrs straight, then paused and tabbed out and used the computer for other purposes.Bugs/exploits (6/10): There are bugs obviously and some of them are more annoying than others, but so far I haven't encountered any game breaking bugs.In regards of exploits, there're plenty, especially when it comes to logging, but working the exploits soon becomes dull and boring and somehow the money grinding is more giving, though it returns less money in the game, but instead of seeing it as right or wrong ways to play the game, I started to see it as ""freedom of choice"" to play the game the way you want to play it.Because maybe not everyone will enjoy every money grinding part of the game and in order to get some fast starters cash, they might prefer a little exploiting just to earn enough to get them going with what they wanna do and hence, spare them the boredom of doing what don't catch their interest in order to play the game.Graphics (8/10): The graphics are good and consistent, most objects has been completed into fine details and just like when you have a meal, if it looks good, its just a better experience than if it doesn't, even though the taste is the same.Conclusion is, that there're plenty of room for improvements, but the game in its current state is very much worth the price.Its actually one of those games where id be prepared to pay twice the price if the physics were just that more refined so that things like the grinder would work flawlessly.Regardless, there're many many hours of entertaining gameplay to be had.Enjoy! :-)			"

												This game is freaking awesome but everyone complains about it not being totally different from FS13 but to be honest GIANTS putting alot of ideas from mods from FS13 which shows that they do care for the farming simulator community and have but the communties mods into there new game. Not only is the game looking really good but also is alot more stable than having a motherload of mods in FS13 which is not good for your pc and if you want other mods you have to make sure they are compatible with your current mods, where as having the totaly new game with all these new componants such as new tools, graphics and engine along with stuff from FS13 mods with better graphics and more stability is alot easier than having a lot of mods in 1 game so people should be grateful the GIANTS are what they are and should really look at the brilliant game GIANTS produced for us to use maybe mod and to have fun on so be happy that GIANTS made modding and such easier for you now just sit down zip yo trap and play the damn game you baby			"

I can't pull some tippers (have'nt tested all) with the New Holland T8.320. Thats a nice $250k that can do only ""some"" jobs..  Big improvment from 2013, especially the physics.

When it said that I could start harvesting the land I instead went on a joy ride in my harvester and learned how to drift in it. I couldn't ask for a better game.11/10 would drift a F****** harvester again "

												Just more shovelware from GIANTS, Farm Simulator 15 ships missing key features the devs then expect to sell you as DLC, while leaving the modding community to clean up their mess.  It's a real shame because the fundamental idea is sound and could be a very enjoyable sandbox, if it wasn't being mismanaged by lazy, greedy, entitled devs.  When GIANTS is ultimately folded in EA in some not-too-distant future, no one will cry because nothing will really have changed.

												Well, it's basically the Arma of the Farm world.It's a farm simulator, which simulates a lot of things, but, doesn't go too deep into physics, not to the point of other titles like Spintires. Power is simulated, for example, your tractor have to be powerful enough to run an implement, and go up hills at the same time. Physics are bit wonky at time, mostly on multiplayer with bad pings.You also need some discipline to not put all the game settings on easy, fast growth, and make time go forward, otherwise you can just use passive to make the game run for 50 years and have enough money for everything.So, if you aren't too much into simulators, or don't like farming that much, this game will probably be a 6/10 for you, and you should wait for a sale to check it out. If you are into simulator, and into farming, then this will easily be a 9/10 for you. It's not bad, it's just a niche genre.			"

												This is a fantastic simulation of farming, ranching and logging. It is by far, the most exciting simulator I have ever played. I grow tired some days of the chaos of first person shooters and just want to kick back, relax, and have fun playing a game, at the pace I want to play it. If you have days where you feel the same, I highly recommend you try Farm Simulator 2015. Many improvements over FS 2013, especially with the ""hired workers"". The graphics will ""blow your mind"". From tire tracks and dust from the tractors, to wheat blowing gently in the wind. Furthermore, there is a large community of ""mod"" makers and a ton of mods one can download to enhance the simulator even further. You can even go as far as creating your own map via the Giants Editor. When you download the game for the first time, make sure you update your graphics card as this simulation uses a ""state of the art"" graphics engine. Enjoy!!  :)			"

												Well what kind of a game are you looking for? This is not s first person shooter, nor a racing game I think the fastest Truck will do  maybe 100. The tractors even less. if you are looking for a game that is as exciting as watching grass grows this is it. The modding community is one of the best there is at least a new map from them every week, The Software company does patch it pretty often most of the time they do fix things, The game can be as tame as you like or as bizarre as you can take from having 20 different crops and 4 differnt animals to raise plus milking over 1000 cows. to farming 20 acres and picking up 10 eggs.I play to relax, like I said you don't get big prizes for completing a crop you learn to play the game better. I am looking at busting maybe 5000 hours before the next edition.Big plus the physics have been taken care of except for the forestry part but it is coming along well. yes I like that part of the game too. The one wierd part is that you get to buy wind generators and yes you can just plant those and sit back and watch the money roll in .....but what kind of fun is that.I would like to make sure that the modders do get the thanks they deserve Great Job everyone that has put out even the little ones!

												LOVE IT!!! i saw a youtuber named Keralis play it, and i instantly fell in love. my best memory on it was when i went into debt on day one because i hired a worker to plow my field and i let it run through the night. i took out so many loans from the bank. now, on the same map, im at 2 billion dollars. moral of it, its so fun. i may have 2 billion dollars, but i still have stuff to do in the game. and with the new DLC coming out, ill be busyfor a while. i cant wait till the next one.but be warned, its a little time consuming until you get enough money to hire workers and you wan walk away without worrying about going into debt. when you get above about 500k, you are probably ableto do that.

												Game is highly addictive.  Say goodbye to your family.  You will start small and in no time you will have the big harvesters and be doing millions in silage.  Courseplay is a must have if you want automate you fieldwork.  A short time later you will mod the game and open a whole new aspect of the game.  I would have to say the least rewarding is the animals in the game.  I have tried all three and there is no way to automate the feeding process which is very time consuming.			"

												So the Farming Simulator just came out and you are looking to me to provide an accurate assesment on the new game, well this is what I have. If you enjoyed playing the older farming simulators and got tired of the tractors falling over all the time, and all the parts on the tractor that should move but didnt. If you couldnt stand how trees got in your way when planting. You will love this new simulator, like first off when you drive the tractors you can feel and see how they react to the ground, and how they do get overloaded and slid down hills when the wagon is too heavy. When you drive it leaves tracks and the rain and dust dosnt come in the cab. When you unload grain in to a wagon is fills according to how the grain is falling. The combines are completly redone and you dont start out with some turd, you get a quality combine. When you do get your wagon full you will notice hills are not your friend lol. The wood cutting is briliant and they took their time, you notice it in the game. All in all if you want to have some fun and share mods with your friends then i highly recomend this gam to every farming simulator lover.			"

Also, filled tippers have weight so when you are going down a hill with a filled tipper you have to remember to break. The graphics have improved as well. They have added mirrors to your vehicles which is a nice touch as well. Overall, it is a great improvement on FS13			"

												Let me add to all the reviews that say, ""I know it seems strange, but I love this game"". I am a huge fan of simulations.Zen and the Art of Farming? I've never had any deep self-realizations while playing but my mind can easily wander like driving on a country road.The game is very simple but not in a bad way. I feel like they got the basic mechanics correct and polished it. They didnt get over-ambitious and then blow it like so many game developers do. It reminds me of how Blizzard operates. Simple design, simple ruleset. Build out from a solid foundation. That being said I feel like the UI in this current version is a step backward and there wasnt much operational progress. The major difference in 15 over 13 is the addition of Forrestry operations. In general however there are many aspects of the game to explore such as animal husbandry, jobs and missions and the afore mentioned forrestry.There are many aspects of this game i'd like to see improved. The UI is not entirely terrible but far from ideal. Detail is pretty low and viewing distance could be better. AI could definately be upgraded however what it does do it does well.As I mentioned before the game feels right. There are a few little gotchas. Nothing i'd really call bugs. Sometimes there is weirdness with the physics engine but generally it works quite well. Watching something boring but not boring enough to stop watching? Farming Simulator is excellent mental wood putty.			"

												Well what kind of a game are you looking for? This is not s first person shooter, nor a racing game I think the fastest Truck will do  maybe 100. The tractors even less. if you are looking for a game that is as exciting as watching grass grows this is it. The modding community is one of the best there is at least a new map from them every week, The Software company does patch it pretty often most of the time they do fix things, The game can be as tame as you like or as bizarre as you can take from having 20 different crops and 4 differnt animals to raise plus milking over 1000 cows. to farming 20 acres and picking up 10 eggs.I play to relax, like I said you don't get big prizes for completing a crop you learn to play the game better. I am looking at busting maybe 5000 hours before the next edition.Big plus the physics have been taken care of except for the forestry part but it is coming along well. yes I like that part of the game too. The one wierd part is that you get to buy wind generators and yes you can just plant those and sit back and watch the money roll in .....but what kind of fun is that.I would like to make sure that the modders do get the thanks they deserve Great Job everyone that has put out even the little ones!

												Farming Simulator 15 is my new game for over 250 hours and have yet to be bored with it. With multiple game save options, each farm can be tailored-made with many creative possibilities. One farm I've built from the groundup has been designed a grain farm, another livestock and yet another the economy is designed around lumberjack with some grain and livestock on the side. Multiplayer servers have been solid, not to mention the fun of farming with others.  Utilizing the option of placeable objects can enhance your economy or dominate it. Mods are available, I love my monster truck and have spent time jumping off mountains and hills with it while waiting for my crops to grow. My friends and I have even had truck races when we was just too plum tired to farm after a hard nights work. The hours go by fast playing this one, so if you take the plunge, be prepared to be forced to logoff and go to bed when you really dont want to. Expansions are available and more to come. Hope to see you in the fields. - Battleborn			"

												I had no idea farming could be so much fun.Try to pitch this game to someone who doesn't know what it is about: Yeah, so you mount a sower on your tractor, drive to the field and sow it, then you drive back, unmount the sower, mount a fertilizer and drive back to the field to fertilize it. Then you speed up the game and wait 5 minutes until the crops has grown. Then you get in your harvester and start harvesting, but you also have to bring a tractor with a tipper, so you can unload the crops. When the entire field has been harvested, you must cultivate the field first, and then you start over.I just realized how boring that sounds. But that's the funny thing about this game; it sounds SO boring and bland, but in reality it is surprisingly fun. I don't know why. The youtubers I've watched playing the game also don't know why. It just is.But.. once you've passed the 10-20 hour mark and start making real progress, have to manage multiple fields and do your best to come up with the most efficient flow, you start to get a little frustrated by the lack of automation in the game. Basically you have one option and one option only: when you have aligned your machine with the field, you can ""hire worker"" to get the stuff done. That's fine and works as intended, for the most part..But the workers are pretty stupid. They get stuck very easily, and you won't notice until you happen to tab into the worker's machine, only to discover that the entire proces has been halted for 30 minutes because he ran into a tree while he was turning, and apparently he hasn't heard of this thing called ""to reverse"". HUGE con: The game does not give you any feedback on workers AT ALL, so you have to constantly tab through all your stuff to make sure everything is running smoothly. You also can't make workers do ""passive"" stuff, like wait for a harvester to get full and then drive up to it with a tipper, or tell them to unload crops from the silo and drive it off to a sell point. In other words, once you have a handful of fields, you'll be quite busy monitoring the progress, giving work orders, driving equipment from one field to another, helping stuck workers get unstuck and so on. And that's where the tediousness kicks in and the fun factor starts to decline.The extreme lack of automation drives most people to use mods, or, well, one mod in particular, called Courseplay. Obviously this is a review of the vanilla game, so I will just say this: while Courseplay does offer a lot more automation features, it is very far from perfect. Courseplay will have you curse at the screen repeatedly, because the AI is basically still extremely poor. Even though you can make workers do more things, especially the ""passive"" stuff, you still have to sort out stuck workers all. the. time. So don't expect any wonders, only a little help. And more frustration.Said frustration is the reason why I've stopped playing this game now. But it took 76 hours before I reached that point, and it was great fun until then. I consider that pretty good value for money.			"

												Okay so you would think a simulator about farming is pointless right? Well you're wrong this game has given me many weeks worth of fun, from the forestry to the simple growth of conola and then selling it to get more equipment. This game has to be rated 10/10 and it's worth a buy if you and your friends like a long and hard grind yet fun with the multiplayer aspect, note you can change the grow speed which makes the grind bit go away. I never looked for glitches so I myself never found any, Personally I would love it if they made the house useable and I know its pointless but it would be fun to have a cook what you grow system to! Then you could also have sleep fatigue, lifestyle needs and so on. My list would ruin this review so remember if you like to have fun try this game!			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is my new game for over 250 hours and have yet to be bored with it. With multiple game save options, each farm can be tailored-made with many creative possibilities. One farm I've built from the groundup has been designed a grain farm, another livestock and yet another the economy is designed around lumberjack with some grain and livestock on the side. Multiplayer servers have been solid, not to mention the fun of farming with others.  Utilizing the option of placeable objects can enhance your economy or dominate it. Mods are available, I love my monster truck and have spent time jumping off mountains and hills with it while waiting for my crops to grow. My friends and I have even had truck races when we was just too plum tired to farm after a hard nights work. The hours go by fast playing this one, so if you take the plunge, be prepared to be forced to logoff and go to bed when you really dont want to. Expansions are available and more to come. Hope to see you in the fields. - Battleborn			"

												Wow, fantastic sim of all the vehicles.  I have spent so much time on my farm I know every hill, every, tree, every blade of grass and pile of dirt.  I know when my crops will be ready, when the harvestor will be done, when the cultivator needs to be readied ...  Not bad considering I have lived my entire life in a big city.There is a large selection of vehicles to purchase and they can all be operated manually, or hire a worker to operate it for you.  Buy more land to expand your farm or try raising sheep or cows.Be sure to check out the youtube clips for gameplay or tutorials.The modders are incredible.  I couldn't survive without Glance and Courseplay to monitor and control my fleet.  GPS is also great when you want to drive in a straight line.  Placeable seeds and fertilizer, amazing, I love you guys.  Pallet mover is a joy, but only available on modded maps, come on Giant, get those pallets moving.Uh oh, gotta run, the manure is piling up.			"

												This is a fantastic simulation of farming, ranching and logging. It is by far, the most exciting simulator I have ever played. I grow tired some days of the chaos of first person shooters and just want to kick back, relax, and have fun playing a game, at the pace I want to play it. If you have days where you feel the same, I highly recommend you try Farm Simulator 2015. Many improvements over FS 2013, especially with the ""hired workers"". The graphics will ""blow your mind"". From tire tracks and dust from the tractors, to wheat blowing gently in the wind. Furthermore, there is a large community of ""mod"" makers and a ton of mods one can download to enhance the simulator even further. You can even go as far as creating your own map via the Giants Editor. When you download the game for the first time, make sure you update your graphics card as this simulation uses a ""state of the art"" graphics engine. Enjoy!!  :)			"

												Farming Simulator 15 developed by GIANTS is the best game I've ever purchased. My addiction started back in 2012 when 2013 came out. I purchased it, and then I had gotten to 198 hours before 15 came out. I loved 2013 so much, but 15 really was a big improvement with logging. The graphics and overall performance of the game is excellent, and it runs perefect on most mid range laptops/desktops. I personally like the ability of modding the game with modded maps, tractors, implements, semis, trailers, tillage, soil mods, texture mods, plant mods, etc., created by other people. The modding is the best part, in my opinion. Another thing I really like is multiplayer. I would like to put out that I've met 3 friends and have continued to play with them. Believe it or not, I have connected with them on other forms of social media (Facebook). Another one of them actually has my mobile number, and we text regularly. :) It just makes me happy because where I live, no one listens to me and I don't really have ANY friends. So when I'm not at school, I can come home and get on my computer and play/connect with my friends that I don't have where I live. This just shows the power of this game and how it has changed my life. I actually loved the previous version so much that I preordered 15, and also have purchased the Gold expansion recently only because it was on the Christmas sale, and I had left over money after another purchase.If you read all that or not, it doesn't matter much. No matter what I will ALWAYS recommend this game to any patient person who is willing to wait for things. I would mostly recommend to any fellow farmers out there.This is my full review of Farming Simulator 15 the game for PC by GIANTS. If this inspires you to purchase this game, I'm very happy about that. PLEASE support GIANTS for what a great game they have created. Their game changed my every day life. It just might change yours too. :)			"

												I had no idea farming could be so much fun.Try to pitch this game to someone who doesn't know what it is about: Yeah, so you mount a sower on your tractor, drive to the field and sow it, then you drive back, unmount the sower, mount a fertilizer and drive back to the field to fertilize it. Then you speed up the game and wait 5 minutes until the crops has grown. Then you get in your harvester and start harvesting, but you also have to bring a tractor with a tipper, so you can unload the crops. When the entire field has been harvested, you must cultivate the field first, and then you start over.I just realized how boring that sounds. But that's the funny thing about this game; it sounds SO boring and bland, but in reality it is surprisingly fun. I don't know why. The youtubers I've watched playing the game also don't know why. It just is.But.. once you've passed the 10-20 hour mark and start making real progress, have to manage multiple fields and do your best to come up with the most efficient flow, you start to get a little frustrated by the lack of automation in the game. Basically you have one option and one option only: when you have aligned your machine with the field, you can ""hire worker"" to get the stuff done. That's fine and works as intended, for the most part..But the workers are pretty stupid. They get stuck very easily, and you won't notice until you happen to tab into the worker's machine, only to discover that the entire proces has been halted for 30 minutes because he ran into a tree while he was turning, and apparently he hasn't heard of this thing called ""to reverse"". HUGE con: The game does not give you any feedback on workers AT ALL, so you have to constantly tab through all your stuff to make sure everything is running smoothly. You also can't make workers do ""passive"" stuff, like wait for a harvester to get full and then drive up to it with a tipper, or tell them to unload crops from the silo and drive it off to a sell point. In other words, once you have a handful of fields, you'll be quite busy monitoring the progress, giving work orders, driving equipment from one field to another, helping stuck workers get unstuck and so on. And that's where the tediousness kicks in and the fun factor starts to decline.The extreme lack of automation drives most people to use mods, or, well, one mod in particular, called Courseplay. Obviously this is a review of the vanilla game, so I will just say this: while Courseplay does offer a lot more automation features, it is very far from perfect. Courseplay will have you curse at the screen repeatedly, because the AI is basically still extremely poor. Even though you can make workers do more things, especially the ""passive"" stuff, you still have to sort out stuck workers all. the. time. So don't expect any wonders, only a little help. And more frustration.Said frustration is the reason why I've stopped playing this game now. But it took 76 hours before I reached that point, and it was great fun until then. I consider that pretty good value for money.			"

												Let me add to all the reviews that say, ""I know it seems strange, but I love this game"". I am a huge fan of simulations.Zen and the Art of Farming? I've never had any deep self-realizations while playing but my mind can easily wander like driving on a country road.The game is very simple but not in a bad way. I feel like they got the basic mechanics correct and polished it. They didnt get over-ambitious and then blow it like so many game developers do. It reminds me of how Blizzard operates. Simple design, simple ruleset. Build out from a solid foundation. That being said I feel like the UI in this current version is a step backward and there wasnt much operational progress. The major difference in 15 over 13 is the addition of Forrestry operations. In general however there are many aspects of the game to explore such as animal husbandry, jobs and missions and the afore mentioned forrestry.There are many aspects of this game i'd like to see improved. The UI is not entirely terrible but far from ideal. Detail is pretty low and viewing distance could be better. AI could definately be upgraded however what it does do it does well.As I mentioned before the game feels right. There are a few little gotchas. Nothing i'd really call bugs. Sometimes there is weirdness with the physics engine but generally it works quite well. Watching something boring but not boring enough to stop watching? Farming Simulator is excellent mental wood putty.			"

												OMG I LOVE THIS GAME!!!There's something soothing about watching the tracktor plogh accross the land. Cutting up rows - back-n-forth - can really make you feel good.I play this with my headphones on, n this actually adds to the realisim. Having worked using big machinary like the machinary in this game, you have to have ear-muffs on, so it feels right.I don't even really like to refer to this as a game, because it feels unlike any other. I 1st used a Steering Wheel n Pedal combo, and had A LOT OF FUN. However, I've also used my 'N64 USB' controller, and it's just as fun. You get a sense of importance while playing. Like your life depends on a good crop. That's some serious♥♥♥♥♥imersion.Never before have I enjoyed the tutorial levels so much, that I even keep going after the lesson is finished because I wanna finish the feild :-)Many thanks go out to the creators.

												I would definitely recommend this game I played about 150 hours on the Playstation 4 version solo which was a lot of fun although I would only recommend buying the Gold Edition and JBC dlc as I have all dlc on the PS4 but only used gold and JBC equipment. I convinced a friend to buy it on PC and it is even more fun in multiplayer. If you buy this game in a sale you will be getting a massive bargaining, well worth buying but it can get a bit addictive but it is also a game you will keep coming back to. A very good well made game.			"

That's fine and works as intended, for the most part..But the workers are pretty stupid. They get stuck very easily, and you won't notice until you happen to tab into the worker's machine, only to discover that the entire proces has been halted for 30 minutes because he ran into a tree while he was turning, and apparently he hasn't heard of this thing called ""to reverse"". HUGE con: The game does not give you any feedback on workers AT ALL, so you have to constantly tab through all your stuff to make sure everything is running smoothly. You also can't make workers do ""passive"" stuff, like wait for a harvester to get full and then drive up to it with a tipper, or tell them to unload crops from the silo and drive it off to a sell point. In other words, once you have a handful of fields, you'll be quite busy monitoring the progress, giving work orders, driving equipment from one field to another, helping stuck workers get unstuck and so on. And that's where the tediousness kicks in and the fun factor starts to decline.The extreme lack of automation drives most people to use mods, or, well, one mod in particular, called Courseplay. Obviously this is a review of the vanilla game, so I will just say this: while Courseplay does offer a lot more automation features, it is very far from perfect. Courseplay will have you curse at the screen repeatedly, because the AI is basically still extremely poor. Even though you can make workers do more things, especially the ""passive"" stuff, you still have to sort out stuck workers all. the. time. So don't expect any wonders, only a little help. And more frustration.Said frustration is the reason why I've stopped playing this game now. But it took 76 hours before I reached that point, and it was great fun until then. I consider that pretty good value for money.			"

												I love this game. I really do. I take long breaks from it as I get distracted by life, but I always find myself coming back to it, picking up from where I left off. This game is very relaxing to play, with the only slightly anxiety inducing situations being the tedious time it takes to log trees with some of the more complex machinery. Theres plenty of avenues for revenue, and aside from the slow releases of DLC's, this game has enough in it to keep one satisfied on a cool summer night.			"

												Love this game. So happy they had a 50% sale so my poor butt could buy it, lol. 99% perfect imo.... my 3 issues are: #1  No default trailer that can haul Mixed ration, but its not that big of a deal since you have the mixing wagons... just wish we had a default trailer for it. #2  The fuel usage is INSANELY low, even on hard-mode (which is my preferred game setting) with over 4 hours of play time my mission running tractor ( who's running flat-out 99% of the time ) is still @ 98% full on fuel.   #3  Would be nice if the Loan interest was more because on hard with a maxed 200,000 loan amount... im only paying $842/day interest (for those of you who think this is a lot... think about it this way... u can slow time to real so that 1 day is a full 24hrs. So $842 is reaaaaally low for $200k loan.All-in-all.... great game which I HIGHLY recommend for any simulator and/or farming fans out there. Giants did a great job on 2015.			"

												Best game I've ever played. Here's why;Overview:This installment of the Farming Simulator series was my first, and by look at what people have to say, it also seems like it's the best. The game offers some tutorials, which is always nice, and gives you two maps to start your career on. They seem to feature specific areas; one is for logging, the other is for farming. These are not requirements on the map, of course you could do the complete opposite on each. Pros:-Tons of vehicles and gadgets-Easy joystick/gamepad/steering wheel support, along with easy control editing-Lots of 'fruit' types to farm-Animals are awesome-Slight 'easter eggs' found throughout the map-Great graphics if your rig can handle it*-Loads of mods to installCons:-Trying to get the logs into your carrier can be impossibly hard, even with a joystick. I reccomend two joysticks.-Weather comes on quite fast, and the rain looks weird, but it does wash your vehicles so...-The double-hinged tractors and wheel loaders behave quite strange and look weird when turning if the player is using a keyboardVERDICT:I am going to give this game a 9.5/10. I really enjoy sandbox games like these, so if you do too, then I strongly suggest making this purchase.*Some mod's textures cannot be changed using the Game's graphics settings, and are on default on 'Very High' setting. This is only for some mods, and is only a problem if you are using a low end machine.			"

												It's a great game with tons of gameplay hours to it. Once you feel like you've tried it all, then have fun downloading new tractors, combines, equipment, etc. from the community's (and there's a lot of those) Also try out new maps made from other players, OR even start building your own maps and equipment. The possibilities are pretty much endless and therefor it's a great value game for your money in my opinion. I was afraid it would be a bit boring ""just"" to drive tractors and harvest, but the reality is, there's so much more to this game and it can actually be quite a challenge some times. It's 100% up to the player how much you want from this game, because of all the mods that is avaible to you from the community's. I would have liked to see more tractors and equipment build into the game from the beginning, but that's pretty much the only bad thing I got to say about it at this point. ohh yeah... and that chopping down and / or removing trees are a pain in the *** lol. The game get's 9 out of 10 from me ;-)			"

												""It's time..."" said the short man. ""We go at dawn.""The short man went out to his fields, finding that someone had already planted one for him to train with. So, he jumped in a combine and went to harvesting. After His training, the short man decided it was time he got into the forestry business.""I MUST OWN ALL OF THE TRUCKS!"" the short little man said. He bought all of the logging equipment, and went to work chopping trees. After setting up a wood chipper next to a pile of wood, the short man attempted to operate it. ""WHAT IS THIS?!"" exclaimed the short man, ""the conveyor pushes the wood out and doesn't pull it in?!"" The short man got frustrated after a few tries and dumped his forestry equipment into the river. After this, the short man figured he should stick with normal crop farming, as it was less difficult and seemed to work a lot better.			"

												Have not played so much farmsimultor before just tested the older games, They have come long for how many functions they have put into the different vehicles. A chill game.Dlc's, worth to buy.. if your a fan ""boy"" of this game for shure to support the developers.The physics is decent but not as good as it should have been. specialy when comes to the timber part and how metal flex. Bought a few off the dlc's, the gear in it looks good with fine details, but then again the physics when driving with timber you have to crawl with the tractor for preventing the timber to slide of, if you got several tons of timber on a trailer made for timber it does not move, at least not from the accelraition or so from a tractor on a tarmac road. Think they could have put more into the addons like cargo gets strapped on to the trailer when driving like you would do in real life to, it is a simulator. And for the metal that is flexible specialy on cranes on the lumber machine or trailers a bit disapoiting. but for the good part you can chose what you like to farm and harvest and so.			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is a laidback game good for calming down after playing games that make you frusterated like Call of Duty for me the point of the point of the game is to manage a farm upgrade equipment and vehicles to work your farm more efficent. you can work the fields tend to cattle,sheep,Cheickens etc.You can do forestry and their is a bunch of ther thing availaable to do.This game also supports mods and has a big modding community as well for the people who like a little more to their games.Overall i give this game a 7/10			"

												The game is so addicting. there's always something to do. from timbering to planting and harvesting the fields,baling,feeding the animals etc. I see a lot of people say playing a game with friends is more fun but I don't feel the need for a friend for most games but I'll let em join if they want to, but this game, boy let me tell you that I strongly recommend you get a group of friends to play this game because its pure fun. this game has a ton of replay value.I will end my review with this. I am pleased that this game doesn't have microtransactions and pay walls because in the game world they tend to harm the game for the consumer than good. I give the dev team 100 points for this. this review is from someone that has 406 hours and counting on this game.			"

												I can't say enough good things about this game. Yeah the physics may be slightly messed up but all in all the game just is that good that it doesn't matter. There is no stress of hurry up and kill that guy so we can win or hurry and get to max lvl so we can do this raid. there is just you your friends and a field to plow or harvest. I mean how much more calm can you get?You like Mods? Awesome this game has them! I have seen one of the largest modding communities around for this game and i don't think they get the thanks that they deserve.			"

												Best game I've ever played. Here's why;Overview:This installment of the Farming Simulator series was my first, and by look at what people have to say, it also seems like it's the best. The game offers some tutorials, which is always nice, and gives you two maps to start your career on. They seem to feature specific areas; one is for logging, the other is for farming. These are not requirements on the map, of course you could do the complete opposite on each. Pros:-Tons of vehicles and gadgets-Easy joystick/gamepad/steering wheel support, along with easy control editing-Lots of 'fruit' types to farm-Animals are awesome-Slight 'easter eggs' found throughout the map-Great graphics if your rig can handle it*-Loads of mods to installCons:-Trying to get the logs into your carrier can be impossibly hard, even with a joystick. I reccomend two joysticks.-Weather comes on quite fast, and the rain looks weird, but it does wash your vehicles so...-The double-hinged tractors and wheel loaders behave quite strange and look weird when turning if the player is using a keyboardVERDICT:I am going to give this game a 9.5/10. I really enjoy sandbox games like these, so if you do too, then I strongly suggest making this purchase.*Some mod's textures cannot be changed using the Game's graphics settings, and are on default on 'Very High' setting. This is only for some mods, and is only a problem if you are using a low end machine.			"

												Love this game. So happy they had a 50% sale so my poor butt could buy it, lol. 99% perfect imo.... my 3 issues are: #1  No default trailer that can haul Mixed ration, but its not that big of a deal since you have the mixing wagons... just wish we had a default trailer for it. #2  The fuel usage is INSANELY low, even on hard-mode (which is my preferred game setting) with over 4 hours of play time my mission running tractor ( who's running flat-out 99% of the time ) is still @ 98% full on fuel.   #3  Would be nice if the Loan interest was more because on hard with a maxed 200,000 loan amount... im only paying $842/day interest (for those of you who think this is a lot... think about it this way... u can slow time to real so that 1 day is a full 24hrs. So $842 is reaaaaally low for $200k loan.All-in-all.... great game which I HIGHLY recommend for any simulator and/or farming fans out there. Giants did a great job on 2015.			"

												I love this game. I really do. I take long breaks from it as I get distracted by life, but I always find myself coming back to it, picking up from where I left off. This game is very relaxing to play, with the only slightly anxiety inducing situations being the tedious time it takes to log trees with some of the more complex machinery. Theres plenty of avenues for revenue, and aside from the slow releases of DLC's, this game has enough in it to keep one satisfied on a cool summer night.			"

												It's hard to describe this kind of guilty pleasure of mine. It's easy to judge and sure it looks pretty Train Simulator-y in terms of appeal to the audience it's aimed at..But honestly I don't really get that with this. Playing with friends, it's perhaps one of the most relaxing sorts of games you can play while watching a world develop that you play a hand in. Nice sense of community amidst your team while also having plenty of space in the physics engine to be little rascally pains to one another when the time arises.If you tend to like machinery and find yourself with a lot of friends with disposable incomes, there are far worse things you could do than try to see how far you can get 'We are night time Counter Strike Players' farm going without dumping some of your machinery in a lake or causing chaos in traffic with a tree you can't be arsed to trim down.

												Honestly, I love the gameplay of FS15, but it is in no way, a farming simulator.  Sure, you can manually plow up your own fields, and run your own cultivating and sowing machines, but that's nowhere near what all goes into farming.  After you move up from the first field or two you're going to have to start hiring help.  Well, let's face it, 5 years of farming sims later and the help still runs into each other if you don't deploy them at the exatly right time.I've been around real farms my entire life.  While I very much enjoy doing nothing more than hauling tippers after the first 3 hours, it's nothing like running your own farm.  On any real farm, you aren't going to start out with 100hp tractors (hell, a 45 hp one is 40k in America) let alone a Combine with any storage capacity, I personally know of hundred million dollar opperations that still don't have those.  Guess it would be hard to keep players that would have to run a truck or tipper beside their combine to get their haul, but whatever, that's only the real world.If you're a casual gamer, this game's a blast.  Even knowing what I know I still love it. But it's by no means a simulator.			"

												Hello Hardtruck1 hereI would like to tell you all about a game that i really love to playit is Farming Simulator 15I have been playing this game for some time now and it is a very good gameand here is what i think of it.likes:1. it is a very well put together game about farming and with a little lagging as well.2. it dose a good job of giving you a real senes of being on the farm and really working the land.3. altho it dose not give you the full aspect of farming, it dose however give you a really good idea of what we, yes i mean we i'm a farmer in real life, go througt on the farm.and finally 4. some of the more better qualities that farming simulator 15 gives is the large variety of vehicles that come with the game and that it can have, if you so desire, mods.but now for the downfalls of the game:1. although the game is very well thought out, there are a number of things that, well could have been better, one being the graphics could be a bit on the greener side, so to speek, the grass looks like some thing from home depot and the field textures look like they where pulled out of a story book, so not lovin that.2. the next thing is the physics of the game are, well not what i would have hope to see, the physics are, in a way, just like farming simulator 2013, there is really no major difference beteen them, fs13 had some of the craziest physics i'll say, but although the developers did manage to correct some of those with fs15, it's seems that some of the issues with 13 have made there way in to 15.and 3th. the lack of realism in some of the vehicles and lack of realistic details in the way of steering, gearing and other areas that where really disappointing to say the least,so overall there are good and there are bad things about the gamethe good: is that it is a very good way to experience farming with out having to go to a farm that in some places can be rather far.the bad: is that although the game dose give you the farming experience, it falls far from the real thing.so ""Would I Recommend this game""Answer: Yes, but keep in mind that although this game says simulator it dose not match the real thingI give this game a 4 out 5Hardtruck1			"

Bought a few off the dlc's, the gear in it looks good with fine details, but then again the physics when driving with timber you have to crawl with the tractor for preventing the timber to slide of, if you got several tons of timber on a trailer made for timber it does not move, at least not from the accelraition or so from a tractor on a tarmac road. Think they could have put more into the addons like cargo gets strapped on to the trailer when driving like you would do in real life to, it is a simulator. And for the metal that is flexible specialy on cranes on the lumber machine or trailers a bit disapoiting. but for the good part you can chose what you like to farm and harvest and so.			"

												I love this game. Out of all the games I play, I play this one the most. Very easy to use and understand. The maps look amazing. I purchased all the available DLC's and they are all great. It's a very quiet, relaxing game to play. I highly recommend it to all ages. I run it on iMac OSX on full graphics turned up and I get a steady 60+fps. By the way, iMac OSX users and PC users can play together on multiplayer, I get asked that qustion all the time.If anyone would like to ad me as a friend to play some multiplayer together please add me.Cheers			"

												Realistic as hell!! Being someone who was raised on a farm with crops and cattle, I can vouch for this game, you can interact with some of todays best machinery! And it has lots of the major processes that you see in modern farming. Even thought I haven't played this the 80+ that the other commenters do, I still feel as if I should at least write a review. It's easy to get the hang of, it's easy to do stuff. It's just simple, clean, and fun. This is one of my favorite games of 2015, next to Fallout 4. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.			"

												Overall, the gameplay is pretty similar to FS13, but IMO what was needed first and foremost was a major improvement to the game's graphics engine (without sacrificing performance), and FS15 delivers on that. Vehicles and equipment are also very well modelled. FS15 vanilla maps are nicely done, and Bjornholm and Sosnovka (the latter being from the Gold DLC) are a joy to play. More gameplay will no doubt be added in time or with the next version. Devs are listening it seems. I think it's a game that has an exciting future, having seemingly grown in popularity and risen from humble beginnings. I'm in for the ride, and I would recommend anyone jumps on too :-)			"

												I had dipped in and out of people playing this on streams and it always intruiged me♥♥♥♥♥to why it was so popular.... So I parted with my cash and took a step into the world of FS2015.It is just sublime, the machinery models and animations are spot on, and the earning curve for cash allows you to slowly build up a nice suite of machines.  Managing multiple helpers around the map doing tasks whilst trying to keep the crops growing and finding new ways to earn cash actually becomes quite hectic.As a negative, a little more info about crop growing, improving yields etc would be useful.... but hey.. that's what the community is for.FS2015 works brilliantly with a controller and once you get your head around the multiple button combo system for functions it enhances the vehicle handling.... and you can even drift tractors.... ish!It is one of the best sand box sims I have played, and I hope the developers keeping pushing what they can do with the subsequent releases.

												Farming Simulator 2015 is a very fun game at first. When you play this game for more than a year...it gets boring. I've been playing this game for little over 2 years and I don't play it much more. You repeat the same thing. Plant, harvest, over and over. I mostly play for a long long time then stop for a long long time then get back on it again. I purchased all the dlc's and I would not reccomend Holmer. It gives few machines and is not very interseting.			"

												Farming Simulator has gotten sort of a bad rap as being just ""A Simulator"" over the years it's been around, however this isn't your average simulator. Unlike others this is made to a high quality and has a lot of neat features. The game does not have targets to shoot. You do not steal a combine and go on a rampage through the nearest busy city in it, the game is exactly what it advertises, to simulate the jobs done on a modern farm. The genre is not for everyone but as far as simulators go, this one is pretty darn good.			"

												Its a great game what can I say, its my first farm sim (The other ones just didn't look that fun lol, but hey idk, didn't play'em)Good things about this game!1) Many ways to make money and farm2) The tractors are pretty easy to drive3) Hardly any bugs (I've only encounterd 1 so far)4) Theres automactic AI farmers that you can hire for your feild if you don't want to do it your self5) Physics are pretty good, no crashing when you hit stuff and don't spaz out or anythingNow the bad things about this game1) There is a couple of bugs, like not being able to dump a load of something at the mill2) Vehicles don't get damaged3) Most sounds are just loops, like 15 second loops or 5 second loops (Understandable I guess)4) The ground is pretty smoth, would be cool if they added more bumps and rougher ground on roads and such5)  If your not use to the controls it will take a while to get use to them and you will start out slow and fustrated at them.

												I love this game right now.... it's a lot of fun but would be terrible without mods.  Kinda of a copy & paste kind of game, not much substance.  One has to have a good imagination to keep the game going.I wanted a time killer that was rather hands free.. . I got what I wanted and then some.  Have come from an industrial, heavy equipment background, it took me less than a 2 days to master this game.  Its big downfall is the logging system... the graphics engine and the coding makes it impossible to grab and hold on to pieces of wood.  All clamps should be redesigned from scratch... once the log is in the clap, it should stay there until you release the clamp, right now they are never tight in the clamp.  I have worked with every type of clamp in the game and others not in the game.The best way to deal with the log and bale clamp problem is to make them like a tractor attaches to an implent... but for log clamps, have the capability to attach up to 3 mid sized logs or two large ones... that's what you get normally.  For bales, make it so they ""snap in palce"" once stacked.  I used to stack bales and they don't spazz out when touching another bale.-Employees I think should be called robo-control... because I am not sure employees can be this stupid, the AI could be a lot better when using train type implements sowing fields.... only thing that comes to mind is to leave a dog tied up in the back yard.... yeah it can get real gnarly.-Lacks in structures, parking garages, cars, trucks, wood chippers, skidders, etc...-Amazing freedom!  I got a quad mod and put it in the back of my pick up truck!-Fun to play even without mods but I personally would not like this game without mods.-No damage on vehicles... kinda odd in a simulator not to have damage... but I enjoy it.-After spending a good portion of my life in the woods, last thing I want to do is fight with fisher price clamps.-Best hand free time killer money can buy right now.-Your game can keep going even when you alt-tab out - it's amazing at it!  Most games put you on start menu.-Perfect game for home businessmen who need to kill time.-It's not a game, it's a simulator.-Georgeous scenery.-Lacks accomplishments, I got most of them within a few days... could have gotten then a lot earlier too.-Power generation shouldn't be in this game... once you have 1 solar panel, game over, you don't need to do anthing else; makes the game too easy... or should only be allowed on easy mode.-Start Menu lacks big time!!  Need to add key config!!  Amazing key config options though.- Only mods I have are pick ups, a quad, a chipper and garages.-Game needs a float trailer, a real one, hauling a harvester sideways can be problematic... especially with the header on.-Fines and licenses could add to the fun.- I am a retired logger / trucker but also know how to build basic video games... -The BruksUn mod gets rid of trees in a sec, much better.In reality, most agricultural farmers are not loggers and vice versa.  An farmer would call a logger and split the profits 80/20 or whatever, I cvome from and live in a logging, stud milling and paper making area, if I made a logging game like this, I couldn't show my face up there anymore.This is the most fun I had playing a video game since I was a child playing Mario 1, 2, 3 for hours on end.... too where I get up and the first thing I want to do is play.  Yeah it's a boring game but it is what I was looking for and I got what I wanted.  Thank you for making such an amazing time killer!I still think logging makes this game terrible and should be its own game.  Some will deal with it because of passion but it was just grunt work for me.  I didn't buy this game to do grunt work.If anything, I hope the developers re-invent their logging because it has potential.			"

												This is Farm Simulator 2015 by giant software. You can find it on steam for $29.99 (at the time this story was written) Being that I have spent many hours playing FS13 I was looking forward to FS15.Well first thing first! If you have played FS13 it will look and feel very much the same.  In fact many of the textures and buildings look like they came from FS13. It feels like a bit of a rewrite with a lot of the physics problems fixed and a few new features added, also adding new physics problems.First the ability to cut down trees and sell the wood to name one, though the placing of a full grown fur tree makes for easy money. (Via what i hope is a glitch.) The tree claws and grinder can be a bit buggy(new physics problem).Trees can have ghost limbs or fail to fall, adding to the bugginess of it.  You can’t get your forks under logs and there is no way to strap the logs down for transport. That means sometimes they fall off the truck and are hard to pick up. Aww the bugs got to love them.But with a drive-able pickup truck that does 54 mph. Helps to make up for the bugs. All the while making transporting tippers around the map a breeze. Npc cars though can be quite the nuisance. They will stop only mere inches from you and you cannot force them out your way (Pull hair out in frustration at this point while using the big sprayer).  Then to top it off you bounce off when you hit them at full speed I mean WTH is with that.Overall the game plays well and seems to run smooth, but can get laggy when lights are turned on.  I give over all game play 4 out of 5. They still need to fix some bugs with objects interacting together but this game should give you many hours of fun game play, by yourself or with friends in multi-player mode. And  please enjoy the gorgeous sky boxes.The game has some built in mod support. They are easy to find and install. These are just a few that I have found enjoy!!			"

												Farming Simulator is an engaging and interesting game that offers the ability to manage a farm with numerous different specialties. In general, I find that the game is more interesting in multiplayer mode when tasks can be delegated to friends rather than being set in a to-do list and possibly forgotten. After many hours of play, most of the work you do involves driving from place to place and monitoring the (more often than not) hopelessly myopic hired workers. Still, I highly recommend this as a great way to pass time if you are interested in simulators.			"

												If you are tied of shooting monsters enemys tanks ships what ever u point of, and just want to relax with a real world scenario then you came to the right place, this is not about first place win or lose or be fast wse..... you simply just enter your tracktor and go plow sow, harvest or spray your fields, or just walk or drive around and see the landscape and its fine texture, you can find some jobs on the townboards or try see if you can find all of the 100 hidden gold coins around the entier map.  the new is that you can go cut trees down with a chainsaw or a big muscular woodcutter and tow it away with another big towingmachine, BUT the game has its tolls here, scs have done a nice job but the tree isnt staying on the place where you lay it it jumps around and fall of a lot times so all the time you used to fill up your trailer is lost and you can start over again 3-4-5 times before you entering the yard where you can sell the tree for alot of money.

												農業や林業などをするゲーム。地味です、すごい地味です。大事な事なので二回言います。農機を使い、耕して種まいて、実ったら刈り取ってトレーラーに乗せ輸送する。これを延々と繰り返すゲーム。慣れてくると余裕ができ、少し暇になるので曲を聴くことをオススメする。カントリーとかジャズとか昔の曲など。景色が綺麗なので景色を観ながら、地味に、まったり、ぼーっとしながらやるゲーム。楽しいぜ。男のロマン。林業が出来るようになったんですが、切るときは楽しいんだけども、その後の掴んで乗せて輸送するのが難しすぎるぜ・・・。Modが大量にあるので上の事も改善できたりします。			"

												農業や林業などをするゲーム。地味です、すごい地味です。大事な事なので二回言います。農機を使い、耕して種まいて、実ったら刈り取ってトレーラーに乗せ輸送する。これを延々と繰り返すゲーム。慣れてくると余裕ができ、少し暇になるので曲を聴くことをオススメする。カントリーとかジャズとか昔の曲など。景色が綺麗なので景色を観ながら、地味に、まったり、ぼーっとしながらやるゲーム。楽しいぜ。男のロマン。林業が出来るようになったんですが、切るときは楽しいんだけども、その後の掴んで乗せて輸送するのが難しすぎるぜ・・・。Modが大量にあるので上の事も改善できたりします。			"

												Great, time consuming fun.  Physics engine has been improved over FS 11 and FS 13.  I tested it out by crashing into everything at full speeds and into other vehicles being driven by the AI and I do not go flying up into the air, twirling about and getting stuck upside down anymore!For anyone who says driving is like ""being on ice"", when you have a heavy load or trailer connected to your tractor, attach a weight to the front.  It will weight it down and stop the sliding.  The issue is that you have all that weight on the back so when you turn at speed the front end lifts a little bit and you lose traction.Ive played FS11 and FS13 and this is so far better than either.  Only downside is that 1 map is new and 1 map is the American town from the FS13 Titanium Expansion.  But that's no issue to me, there's some great modders and world creators out there so I look forward to them and official DLC from Giants.   9.5/10  (-.5 for reusing an old map in a new game)			"

												this game is a massive improvment from the previous games, there are very few problems with the game and for how small the problems really are they dont really affect the gameplay. the farming is as smooth and as solid as usual and the logging is good however this is were the few small bugs appear. The logs are to light and can sometimes bug out and fly half the way across the map or may shake there self off of your trailerbut these are small problems that could easily be fixed through patches. overall i would give the game a strong 9/10 and eventually when these small bugs get fixed it  could easily be bumped up to 10/10... some more vehicles and implaments for the logging would be nice, just something simple like a log chain for a tractor would be really helpfull.

												English:A true successor to the series, although I must admit I am somewhat disappointed. It is still as addictive, but it is also still more of a leasure game rather than a simulator. They did manage to combine both Farming Simulator and Woodcutter Simulator into 1 game...but I'm not so sure how I feel about that...The player takes on the role of a farmer, with substantial equipment and monetary resources already available as you start. As you try to make money you will find that it is pretty hard to go bankrupt, and before you know it you have the fields and equipment that justify the huge farm complex that you start off with. Then you notice that your equipment is getting dirty, which is a great addition to the game, even though it is only a visual effect and does not affect the way equipment is handling.I have stated in previous versions how the game could really become a proper Farming Simulator, and I have read similar comments in the forums and from other players since, but apparently the developers haven't picked up on that; There is no crop disease, so whatever you put into the ground, it will come out healthy and ready to harvest, always. There is no soil quality, it is always in mint condition and the only purpose for manure and sprayers is to double / triple the yield. On top of that, you start off with a rediculous large farm complex that isnt justified by the 1 - 3 fields you also start off with.The community has made some interesting mods that solve some of these problems, but I'd rather see them in the vanilla game.For those that are familiar with the previous versions, here are some nuisances you'll encounter:First off, remember the PDA? That little device in the bottom-left corner of the screen that showed you a map, demand, livestock info and all that? Ya, you now have to press I which will open an screen and pause the game. This is not much of a problem per se, but do you also remember the phones, where you can get information about just about anything, like a manual? When you interact with that you get a similar screen, but the game continues on the background. Which means that if you don't have the equipment to do something while your crops are growing, you will either have to go on a long strawl or read every page at the payphone; No more checking demand, livestock, etc while you watch your favourite handyman take the wheel of your combine...All in all a good game, but in my opinion it still does not live up to its name, and the developers seem to have other things on their minds than adding more interesting game mechanics.Dispite all of this ranting I cannot help but give this a thumbs up, because it is true to its legacy, addictive as hell, and it looks great without ruining the game (hint to Egosoft).-------------------------------------------------------------Nederlands:Een waardige opvolger van de serie, hoewel ik to moet geven dat ik enigszins teleurgesteld ben. Het is nog steeds verslavend, maar ook meer een nutteloos tijdsverdrijf dan een echte simulator. Ze hebben het voor elkaar gekregen om Farming Simulator samen te voegen met hun Woodcutter Simulator...maar ik weet niet hoe ik daar over denk op dit moment...De speler stapt in de rol van een boer, met veel werktuigen en financiele bronnen beschikbaar al vanaf dat je begint. Terwijl je probeert wat geld te verdienen kom je er snel achter dat het moeilijk is om failliet te gaan, en voor je het weet heb je de velden en de werktuigen die passen bij het formaat van je erf en de gebouwen die er al sinds het begin staan. Dan valt het je op dat je werktuigen vies worden, een goeie toevoeging aan het spel, hoewel dit slechts esthetisch is en geen enkele werking heeft op de werktuigen.Ik heb in recencies van vorige versies al aangegeven hoe het spel een echte Farming Simulator kan worden, en ik heb sindsdien soortgelijke opmerkingen in forums en recensies van andere spelers gezien, maar blijkbaar hebben de ontwikkelaars daar niets mee gedaan; Je planten kunnen niet ziek worden, dus wat je ook in de grond stopt, het komt er altijd kerngezond uit. Er is geen grondkwaliteit, het is altijd in perfecte staat en het enige doel van de mest en sproeiers is het verdubbelen / verdrievoudigen van je oogst. Daar komt nog bij dat je met een belachelijk grote boerderij begint die niet overeen komt met de 1-3 velden waarme je begint.Er zijn een aantal interessante mods gemaakt door de spelers die veel van deze problemen oplossen, maar ik zou het spel liever aangepast zien worden zodat het niet nodig zou zijn.Voor hen die bekend zijn met de vorige versies, hier zijn wat irritaties die je tegen zult komen:Ten eerste, ken je de PDA nog? Dat kleine apparaatje links ondering je scherm waarop je de kaart, prijzen, je veestapel enzo kon vinden? Ja, die is dus weg. Nu moet je op I drukken om een venster te zien waar datzelfde beschikbaar is, alleen wordt het spel gepauzeerd. Dit is niet per se een probleem, maar herinner je je de telefoons nog waar je informatie over alles kon vinden als een soort handleiding? Als je daar nu gebruik van maakt krijg je een soortgelijk scherm, maar het spel blijft op de achtergrond doorgaan. Dit betekent dat als je geen werktuigen hebt om jezelf mee te vermaken terwijl je velden aan het bloeien zijn je je of dood verveelt terwijl je wacht, een lange wandeling moet gaan maken of elke pagina in de telefoon moet gaan lezen; Niet meer kijken wat de huidige prijzen zijn of het voedsel niveau van je veestapel controleren terwijl je je favoriete knecht achter het stuur van je combine laat.Al met al een goed spel, maar naar mijn mening is het nog steeds de naam niet waardig, en de ontwikkelaars hebben iets anders aan hun hoofd dat interessante spel mechaniek.Ondanks al dit geklaag kan ik het niet helpen dit product aan te raden, omdat het in de lijn van de serie valt, verslavend als wat is en er grafisch geweldig uitziet zonder dat dat ten koste gaat van het spel (hint naar Egosoft).

												I am utterly perplexed by the thousands of positive reviews for this game, I suppose I must be missing something. For me, this is probably one of the most boring games I have ever played, and I play Train Simulator. Your gameplay options consist of plowing a field, planting seeds in a field, watering a field, harvesting a field, washing a tractor or collecting eggs by walking over them like Super Mario. I understand there are other things you can do like chop down trees and cut the grass and such but to be honest I found the whole experience so mind numbingly boring that I just can't bring myself to play it enough to discover these features. I bought this game with a friend under the assumption we would be building our own farm from scratch and then trading our stock with other farms and so on. In actual fact the farm is already pre made and all you do is plow the fields, then sell your stock in the town by dumping it in a pile next to the buyer's building - very realistic. Your business decisions will involve should I sell my corn to the train station (???) or the biogas farm (spoiler - it makes no difference).  Online play consists of plowing the same fields with other people helping which of course means you can plow more fields, faster. This will enable you to earn money to buy more fields that you can plow which will make you more money so that you can buy more tractors to plow the fields. As I mentioned earlier you can also seed, water and harvest the field but unfortunately all these actions involve driving on the field in a straight line so there really isn't any difference. If you like farming, I would recommend getting a job as a farmer. If you like having neck and shoulder ache and holding down W while watching a tractor drive in a straight line then I would recommend getting this game.			"

												If you're looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

Vehicles get dirty as you use them you can get a pressure washer to clean the equipment.The logging area is a welcome change to just watching things grow. As soon as you can get a log harvester start cutting and selling to the lumber mill. I have made almost a million dollars just selling trees. Also the new ui let you choose between mile/km and dollars/poundsI would definatly recomend this game.Happy farming/loggingDoug			"

												It is difficult to understand just what holds you to this game for hour upon hour, with now over 2000 hours gameplay on Farm Simulator 2013 this version for 2015 is even better. When my family ask me what the attraction is I can't explain why I'm hooked. The physics is noticable straight away in 15 and the graphics have been updated too. Perhaps it is for me just a way to relax after the end of a day, but I still find myself working out the best to make a profit, but as the Sun sets and the Moon begins to rise I end the day standing on my farm cottage porch admiring the view.Now where did I put that pipe.

												For all that are unfamiliar to the francis, in Farming Simulator you get a closer look in to the life of a farmer, like in real life the more work you put in to this game the more profit you will earn and with the money you can upgrade you farming equipment and buy more fields to run an even bigger profit and expand your farm. Keeping in mind that this isn't a triple A title, and they only ask 30$ as release price, knowing that i find that Gaints has done a great job in creating this game, it may not run on the same level of graphic like other games like Destiny or Diablo 3, but i think in over haul it looks fine as it is, simple but fun. So in the end it's all up to your preference if you gon like this game or not, it's not a story based game casual.What's new in fs15? The biggest thing will be the foresting, you now have a new way to make money by chopping wood. The next thing you gone notice is the upgrade in graphics, everything looks more polished then in FS13. Then there is more realisme added to the game, where weights are more important and to pull off a large trailer you may need a stronger tractor, then there is a power issue where a cheap tractor won't operate two pieces of equipment at the same time, so when buying a new tractor at the shop you really need to ask your self what you gone use it for. And yes!!! you now have the option to turn on/off the withering of crops, and you get rear view mirrors, nicely done Gaints thank you for listening to your customers.Now there are some low points to this game, not that they are game breaking but who knows maybe Giants read this review and acts on it and if not then at least a review must give it all right? *There is a new PDA system and its full screen, the game pauses and if you are used of playing FS13 you know how handy it was to drive and check the pda at the same time for prices or demands, well you can't anymore. *Missions, the got a new system now where you have to walk to a board and check if there are any missions you may want to do, sadly enough this can be annoying if your waiting for that one mowing mission or for a demand to popup, cause you have to leg it each time to the nearest mission bord.*Screen tearing, seams Giants forgot to add Vsync, now if your good with pc's then you can change that in your graphic card settings but not everyone is a computer wizard and a option in game can really make a difference.I was hoping for some Ski Simulator in FS15 but maybe Giants is holding that for there next installment who know, anyway the game feels addictive like all previous farming games and by the time i get bored with the vanilla game i am sure i can look forward to many mods to breath new life in to the game.

												Few hours in, and for the price this is another great game by the developers.  Some of the equipment and one map is from the 2013 Titanium DLC, but I personally loved that DLC, so I'm not mad that they introduced them again.For $30 it's a fun game that I will spend countless hours on, as I did with the other games in the series.  My biggest complaints with the older versions (2011, 2013) were the physics and the Heads Up Display, and both of them have been fixed wonderfuly.Multiplayer is also going to be a blast with several of my friends.The visuals are pretty stunning, there's tracks on the ground where you have drove, and wagons will fill up differently compared to where the auger on the combine is located.

												Do you ever get that feeling when you play a game for 2-3 hours and the game turns so boring you legit want to commit suicide afterwards?When you play Farming Simulator 15, you end up playing for 14-15 hours straight, having no clue why you don't get bored of it, and when you actually stop playing, you want to commit suicide by the thought of how many hours you've wasted running a virtual farm.I spent 8 hours planting and chopping trees and 2 weeks later i still have no idea why it was so much fun.

												This game is absolutely amazing running you're own farm driving tractors about and other vehicles.This game is repetetive but what do you think us real farmers do lol, if you are a real farmer this is a good game to play.You can add mods which is pretty cool i added a couple of different mods my favourite being the massey ferguson 8737.I might not have as many hours as most people only becuase i work and play on different games with freinds but this is a great solo game or multiplayer what ever suits you i guess.But this is my review and i hope you enjoy this game as much as i did :)			"

												I am a returning fan to the Farming Simulator Series.  FS15 is another great hit!  I usually play games like Far Cry, Crisis and huge deeply involved RPGs, however, I am completely obsessed with FS15... The graphics are improved over the older versions and overall it seems that the game concept has remained the same.  The base game is nothing special compared with the previous versions, but then again FS13 was really all about the MODS.  The only gripe I have is a slightly awkward selling point for straw that makes the entire process cumbersome.  That being said I am really looking foward to new maps and MODS from the community.  If you are not a graphic mongering zombie apocalypse shoot em in the face only type person, even if your are, this is a great way to relax and enjoy some time away from it all.			"

There are so many things to do and there is just somthing about this game that pulls you back in for more, and if you need so money you could take out a loan or work for it by farming or logging (By the way logging is a great way to earn money at the start of the game) overall the game is well worth the money and i would pay for the dlc's just because i like the game.

Vehicles get dirty as you use them you can get a pressure washer to clean the equipment.The logging area is a welcome change to just watching things grow. As soon as you can get a log harvester start cutting and selling to the lumber mill. I have made almost a million dollars just selling trees. Also the new ui let you choose between mile/km and dollars/poundsI would definatly recomend this game.Happy farming/loggingDoug			"

												It is difficult to understand just what holds you to this game for hour upon hour, with now over 2000 hours gameplay on Farm Simulator 2013 this version for 2015 is even better. When my family ask me what the attraction is I can't explain why I'm hooked. The physics is noticable straight away in 15 and the graphics have been updated too. Perhaps it is for me just a way to relax after the end of a day, but I still find myself working out the best to make a profit, but as the Sun sets and the Moon begins to rise I end the day standing on my farm cottage porch admiring the view.Now where did I put that pipe.

												For all that are unfamiliar to the francis, in Farming Simulator you get a closer look in to the life of a farmer, like in real life the more work you put in to this game the more profit you will earn and with the money you can upgrade you farming equipment and buy more fields to run an even bigger profit and expand your farm. Keeping in mind that this isn't a triple A title, and they only ask 30$ as release price, knowing that i find that Gaints has done a great job in creating this game, it may not run on the same level of graphic like other games like Destiny or Diablo 3, but i think in over haul it looks fine as it is, simple but fun. So in the end it's all up to your preference if you gon like this game or not, it's not a story based game casual.What's new in fs15? The biggest thing will be the foresting, you now have a new way to make money by chopping wood. The next thing you gone notice is the upgrade in graphics, everything looks more polished then in FS13. Then there is more realisme added to the game, where weights are more important and to pull off a large trailer you may need a stronger tractor, then there is a power issue where a cheap tractor won't operate two pieces of equipment at the same time, so when buying a new tractor at the shop you really need to ask your self what you gone use it for. And yes!!! you now have the option to turn on/off the withering of crops, and you get rear view mirrors, nicely done Gaints thank you for listening to your customers.Now there are some low points to this game, not that they are game breaking but who knows maybe Giants read this review and acts on it and if not then at least a review must give it all right? *There is a new PDA system and its full screen, the game pauses and if you are used of playing FS13 you know how handy it was to drive and check the pda at the same time for prices or demands, well you can't anymore. *Missions, the got a new system now where you have to walk to a board and check if there are any missions you may want to do, sadly enough this can be annoying if your waiting for that one mowing mission or for a demand to popup, cause you have to leg it each time to the nearest mission bord.*Screen tearing, seams Giants forgot to add Vsync, now if your good with pc's then you can change that in your graphic card settings but not everyone is a computer wizard and a option in game can really make a difference.I was hoping for some Ski Simulator in FS15 but maybe Giants is holding that for there next installment who know, anyway the game feels addictive like all previous farming games and by the time i get bored with the vanilla game i am sure i can look forward to many mods to breath new life in to the game.

												Worth it on sale or if you want a slightly better looking FS13. Definately worth it if you want to be drunk near farm machinary and not have to worry about losing an arm. FS15 is a decent refresh of FS13, the new shaders are definately a visual improvement on the equipment. Forestry is a nice addition. That said, it is still full of hilarious FarmSimulator-esque physics issues and minor annoyances from lack of attention-to-detail (like the Log trailer doesn't unload correctly at the designed depot, so why bother with it?). While the tractors/equipment look great, the stock buildings and terrain/enviroment lighting continue to look as drab as they did in FS13. Custom mod/map support still is present (as it was in FS13), however it's also obvious it's setup for future DLCs (for pay?).  "

												Farming SimulatorWhen should you purchase this - During a salePositives- Tonnes of vehicles to choose from- Extremely varied gameplay- Great fun in multiplayer- Extensive Mod supportNegatives- Expensive- Gets a little repetitive- Small Community- Hard to use claw controlsReviewEver since i bought my pc ive started to get into simulator games more and more id seen farming simulator but thought it would be pretty naff and boring but after i saw some gameplay and some friends playing i soon relised the game had a fantastic range of tasks from harvesting to feeding cows and now even forestry and was one of the many great simulation games.Yes your friends take this♥♥♥♥♥♥but its worth it its a very fun game.If your interested in machinery/vehicles the you wont be disappointed there is a vast range of each vehicle and implement type with a wide array of mods just itching to join them. There are so many great mods from stunning HD map mods with extremly realistic farms that blurr the line between real life and a videogame to harvesters and tractor. The mod support for this game is probably the best ive seen ive never been so compelled to dive into mods. Currently i have 1.5gb of mods for the game which is away expanding.If you have friends to play this game with it can bring many hours of enjoyment. But in my opinion without friends this game becomes lonely and stale. The controls for the game are brilliant even with a keyboard and mouse the only bad thing about the controls are the clamp tools that are manly used in forestry i found them far to annoying and very hard to use.In conclusion FS15 is a great game to play with friends with an extensive range of mods. Great graphics and great controls. The only problem is the community on steam is quite small with few discussions and i find it really hard to meet someone to play multiplayer with. This game is worth a buy but i would hold out for a sale as £20 is a bit steep considering its been the same price since launch late 2014 and the farming sim franchise will be expanding to FS17 by the end of 2016.Rating  : 7/10			"

However that all changed when I realized that the best way to make money isn't farming but♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥the land of all the trees. If you want money you just chop every tree you can see until there is no more oxygen left on the planet.

Plough, Till, Drill, Wait, Harvest, Unload Trailer, Bale, Pick Bales up, feed a cow, move bales, watch bales explode, repeat.  I know now why my friends laugh.			"

												Good points but some bad points that were in FS13 yet they are in the new title.Graphics: Fantastic! we now have quality the matchs todays tech'. ..I'm afraid thats about it as the game is just FS13 with next-gen graphics. how?heres how.Same basic support for G27, (not all buttons can be used, force feed back etc)Same lack of engine scripting (ingition etc)same basic control (no need for brakes as you stop as soon as you get of the throttle nearly)Same lack of view command (snap look etc)same simple, basic maps (not to worry as the community will sort this)So in short we have Farm Sim 13 with a make-over and some new tools etc. but I may be let down by the base game yet I know in 6 months to a year the talent of the community will turn this into a top class game. THAT i cannot wait for. then ill really enjoy the game. Recommend? ..yes, right now? neh..Go get em modders!Boo developers!  V'			"

												This Simulator was my first and I was blown away with the graphics and the overall detail in the game. You can farm, cut logs, or just deliver goods; and all of it was fun. Not to mention this game always has mods being updated from previous versions to work with the current one, making the game even more entertaining and worth while.			"

												A lot of people laughed at this game, and so did I. Then I tried it out of curiousity, and promptly lost a couple of days in it.You need to play this game as you would minecraft. It's kind of a zen thing, you do repetitive tasks, but it's really compelling in a strange way, and it sucks up so much time and you know you should go to bed but you just want to go back and do _one_more_thing.The graphics are decent for a game of this time. The mud effects on vehicles are nice, and the lighting is good. Skyboxes are very pretty. Vehicles are amazingly detailed, every time I buy a new one I spend a good couple of minutes just looking at all the work they put into the model. The environment textures are relatively low-res, which is a shame.The driving physics are... adequate. They're not great, but you don't really notice when you're playing. It's not like OMSI or ETS2, where you are really into the driving aspect of the game. That isn't really the point here. I'd like to see some improvements, though.The forestry physics are... surprisingly good. They're still quite buggy, but compared to other simulator titles, they're pretty damn good. It's perfectly functional and enjoyable, but not exceptional.Sound design is good, the vehicle sounds are surprisingly nuanced, and you can hear the engine and transmission system working independently of each other. The environment sounds are just lovely, with animals, wind noises, planes passing overhead... It's quite immersive. For me, sound design like this is lacking in a lot of games. It's no OMSI, but it's better than ETS2, and this is a core part of the game's immersion in my opinion.Overall I definitely recommend trying it, especially if you enjoy resource gathering games where you can just zone out and relax, like Minecraft or Terraria.

												Farming SimulatorWhen should you purchase this - During a salePositives- Tonnes of vehicles to choose from- Extremely varied gameplay- Great fun in multiplayer- Extensive Mod supportNegatives- Expensive- Gets a little repetitive- Small Community- Hard to use claw controlsReviewEver since i bought my pc ive started to get into simulator games more and more id seen farming simulator but thought it would be pretty naff and boring but after i saw some gameplay and some friends playing i soon relised the game had a fantastic range of tasks from harvesting to feeding cows and now even forestry and was one of the many great simulation games.Yes your friends take this♥♥♥♥♥♥but its worth it its a very fun game.If your interested in machinery/vehicles the you wont be disappointed there is a vast range of each vehicle and implement type with a wide array of mods just itching to join them. There are so many great mods from stunning HD map mods with extremly realistic farms that blurr the line between real life and a videogame to harvesters and tractor. The mod support for this game is probably the best ive seen ive never been so compelled to dive into mods. Currently i have 1.5gb of mods for the game which is away expanding.If you have friends to play this game with it can bring many hours of enjoyment. But in my opinion without friends this game becomes lonely and stale. The controls for the game are brilliant even with a keyboard and mouse the only bad thing about the controls are the clamp tools that are manly used in forestry i found them far to annoying and very hard to use.In conclusion FS15 is a great game to play with friends with an extensive range of mods. Great graphics and great controls. The only problem is the community on steam is quite small with few discussions and i find it really hard to meet someone to play multiplayer with. This game is worth a buy but i would hold out for a sale as £20 is a bit steep considering its been the same price since launch late 2014 and the farming sim franchise will be expanding to FS17 by the end of 2016.Rating  : 7/10			"

Also when time is sped up the hired workers seem to cost more but the job is not sped up.  Also when starting the game it gives you the basics but its not clear what you are growing and where to deliver it.  Many of the tools and attachemts are confusing.  Its not clear what works with what so its often trial and error.  Could be a good game but needs some work.			"

												Very solid with lots of activites to explore. The game inclues large maps with plenty of terrain to traverse, along with a wide variety of vehicles and impliments to operate. Farming Simulator 15 is a game you can get lost in trying to constantly grow and improve your farming empire. You really can put tons of hours into the game and keep going. If you like simulators, this one is a well built must have.			"

												What game is it : Farming Simulator 2015What is it comparable to : A McDonalds Happy MealI choose to give this game a not recomended, simply because it is like, a Happy Meal..You get in and are hungry, pay for your product and sit down and go on board , but, just like with a Happy Meal, this game only satisfy your hunger for so long.After a few hours, you're there again, still hungry, and the same goes here.. There is simply not really enough ""worth"" of game play in this..Sure you can expand, buy new fields and such.. But in the end, that is only so much fun.For the achivements, they can pretty much all be done within an afternoons worth of game play..You have no say in how your farm is going to be, all is placed beforehand, and you cant even enter your own house to pass the night time.What would make this game more enjoyable to play?Well, an idea would maybe be that you start out small.. A house and a garage, and then slowly you can buy more and more storage and such.But as it is now, it's simply not worth the money nor the time..There's simply not enough variety in the game.. Just like an Happy Meal from McDonalds .. "

												TLDR:  This is a cool tractor driving simulator, it is not an in-depth 'run a farming business' simulator.  Don't buy if you are looking for the economic depth of something like Tropico...I bought this game based on the reviews here, knowing that the majority of what people were talking about was the cool tractor driving, and assuming that surely there was an underlying economic business model behind the running of the farm.  Unfortunately, I was wrong in that assumption, and hence I only played the game for a few hours and won't be returning to it.  If all you are looking for is a cool tractor driving simulator, then cool, enjoy.  But, if you are looking for something where you can dig down in a ledger and see what fields have been producing well, what's the impact of fertilizing to the bottom line, how does the return on investment in the fields compare to the return on investment of buying bee houses or lettuce houses, etc, then this isnt the game for you.  The accounting ledger is extremely simple, doesn't allow you to see where all the in/outflows go, and doesn't allow you to see any history.  This may be a fun game for some, but it lacks the depth that I was hoping for, and I just wanted to warn others like myself.  Peace. "

												I purchased the Gold Edition through Steam during the summer sale.  I have yet to get the game to work.  My PC specs are far above even the recomending requirements.  Yet I get the same error that many, many people do.  Giants software has yet to address the issue, instead blaming people's PC, blaming graphics card drivers, blaming mods, blaming 32 bit systems even though the PC's meet the specs, the graphics card's drivers are up to date, they are running no mods, are using 64 bit systems.They screwed up the update but won't admit it, and won't fix it.  Those of us who bought it *after* there screw up are given the choice of playing a cripled version of the game that doesn't have the maps we bought and paid for, or not playing at all.I, for one, am disappointed that I can't get my money back.Do not waste your money on this or any other Giants product.

												Even tho I like this game alot, compared to 2011 which was the last FS game i played, the differences are not huge, but improving, even tho, starting with a loan of 100k (atleast on normal that is), I feel the tractors and the tools costs to much, also you need to pay a good amount for using the thresher and multiple tractors at once to get the job done, for instance: we found out that using 2 standard sowing machines would be great, but the first tractor to even pull the second cultivator, costs about 160k, the money balance in multiplayer is awful, and to do side missions, mostly mowing and using a fork lift, the mowing seems okay money, but to do the fork lift missions, you need a tractor that costs 70k which is weaker then the first tractor and cant be used to drag any tools at all.+ to pay the loan on the side...7/10, GREAT GAME! but more tools/mods or fixing some on the money income/prices needs to be done for my part.

												Being a fan of fs2011 and 2013 I can say that this game has been improved by no end. I wont go into the improved graphics and engine as this has been covered by many. There are some niggly little things that could and/or may be addressed in patches (such as only one cruise control speed as opposed to 4 in 2013) and logging machines being a little bit awkward to use  - the chipper being nigh impossible.However, before reading any negative comments please note that most people who are saying its too easy are playing on 'easy' difficulty or making changes in the XML files to cheat. Like many games it pays to make your own rules in your own head - ""i want to clear all these logs"" or "" that field needs to be join to that one""8/10 great game			"

												I used to like this game due to I could do what I want when I want.  As of January 22, 2017, the game crashes, even without mods in the mod folder.  Giants technical support is so bad, they have to improve 100 fold before I can say, ""they suck at it."" If the game cannot be run by other than mods, and the fools say, ""They cannot help due to 'corrupt mods,'"" then that is a can of CRAP (the real kind and not the manure in the game)!!What has been happening is the Gaint server crashes every time I load a map (again not mods).  If any of face this same issue, realize Giants are refusing to fix this.  Like me, I cannot get my money back due to I have played it too long and all the rest.  My suggestion is NOT TO GET this game: FS15, FS17, or any version in the near future unless you have money to burn in real life.			"

												Bought the game during a discount. While I like the concept of this video game itself, the minimum specs that they have published is very optimistic. You need a pretty powerful PC for this. And, since I mostly play driving and racing games, I have a G27 setup for it. The internet is full of hit or miss ideas to get it working. So many years and they still do not have proper support for the G27.  I still cannot get it to function properly. Hoping they release a version with support for popular devices like this. For me its a not recommended product at the moment while I try to get it working. If I do, then I will change my recommendation for it.			"

												This game is the worst! I start the game up and I have some tractors and a field. I am like ""What am I suppose to do now?"". Start harvesting the field. Okay so I spent 15 minutes of my life harvesting a field. Then I have to take it and dump it out into my silos. Now I am have to Sow. Then I harvest. Then I collect and dump for money. Then I harvest. Then I Sow, Then I buy cool stuff. Then i look at the time and see its been 48hours!! This is addicting and I have no idea why?! I love and hate (only because I love it so much). The 2013 was a blast, and this one came out with more types of things to work on like a lumber yard. If you can't get enough work from your 9-5, and you want to come home and do more work, this is the game for you. It really is pretty cool.			"

												I had experience on a farm so I thought I would give this game a try. In some ways it is a simple game. It is about micro management. Investing your money to make more money with your various farming incomes. 2 things really bothered me about the game. When you work a field you can hire a worker/bot to do the driving. The bot turns around outside the limits of the field which is not big deal unless other stuff is in the way. Also they have roads go by with bot cars so your farming bot gets stuck in the bot cars that go by. If there is an obstacle in the way the bot farmer will get stuck on that. If you want to do the driving that is fine but it takes time. I like having many things going at the same time but keeping them all going became a hassle. The second bummer was the time speed up you can use. It is good to have but the day and night cycle stay the same so you spend half the game farming in the dark which was no fun for me. They really needed to improve the path finding in this game so the bots don't just all pile up somewhere.If you like a management game this one you might like. It is a bit of a time waster also if you like that.The farming is European so there is no John Deere farm equipment. There are a lot of cool mods out there so you can have any thing you want but I was unable to make it work with the Steam version. The mods showed up in the menu but not in the game. Must want you to micro pay for those.			"

												Unfortunately, I just can't quite recommend this game. If there were a star rating, I'd give it a pretty neutral rating, but since there's no inbetween option, it gets a no. Here's why:Cons for the game- Very little help/ instructions. Almost none at all. This is the single biggest reason for the low rating. After all of the effort put into making this game, you couldn't add an extra couple lines of text? One example, balers. There are 2 types of bales in the game, each made from it's own baler. There is no description as to which kind of bale each machine makes, you just have to know. There are also machines and trailers that interact with these 2 different types of bales. Do these other machines specify which type of bale they work on? Nope! Of course not! Because adding a single line of text, even just a 2 word ""xxxx Bale"" discription would be too much work. Another example is a harvester, the Mex 5. I bought it when I had a little extra money and tried to figure out what it's for since, again, there was no description saying how to use it. I tried cutting different things and no results. Finally I had to look it up online to get an answer.-Very ""hands on"", you can hire workers for some tasks but not many. Alot of the jobs, including what I would consider to be some of the most boring, you cannot hire a worker for. Why? Again, given the scope of the game, would it really be that much harder to implement a feature that you already made on some other duties? Example, you can hire workers for some harvesters but not others. Beet farming looks like it would be the most profitable use of a field, but it takes 10x the work since you cannot hire workers to harvest them until you buy one of the single most expensive machines in the game. Instead you have to sit in the tractor yourself, with one of the narrowest harvester heads in the game. It took half an hour to harvest one of the smallest fields, compared to the under 10 minutes of letting a paid worker do it for me, and I only make about 2x the money. Of course even then beets take up much more room, 3x, so that means 3x the trips from the field to the market where you are selling them.I suppose those are the only cons that come to mind for me. However, they are nearly game breaking in my opinion. You can *almost* play this as a management game, which I would prefer, but too much of the game requires you to actively control the machinery. Also spending hours, and game money, trying to figure out what the machinery does because they could not be bothered to add a description, is just rediculous.Pros:... well I wouldn't say there are any, just some middleground ""okay"" things. Decent or better graphics, though graphics are pretty low on my scale of what makes a game ""good"". Some jobs can be given to workers, allowing you to do other things, or even nothing if you want, while they work. Yep, that's about it in the plus columb for me.			"

												It's all in the small details. I abosultely love the fact equipment gets dirty with use and has functioning mirrors. Gameplay is pretty similar to FS2013 but with the addition of all the small things like tire tracks aids in the imersion. Oh and the icing on the cake for me is that you can now hire helpers to fertilize fields!			"

												It seems like an oddpremise for a game - plant stuff and wait for it to grow, harvest it, sell it and start all over again. The fun is in planning the upgrades you are going to work towards, experimenting with different crops, getting the right mix between hired hands and doing it yourself... and it gets very addictive! Highly recommended.			"

												This is a rewrite to this review. So...... Farming Simulator 2015 (Gold Edition):First off, my father was a smalltime farmer. I used to help him. He's been playing this game for a quite some time and has logged many hours and loves it. I only purchased it with the intent of playing online with him. However......I can't really give this game a good review. While it is somewhat playable, it is also laughable to even consider it as a simulation. First, you start off in a field with some equipment and your first crop ready for harvest. No tutorials (normal mode) and not a clue on what to do. So you basically run around checking things out, till you figure it all out. There's a small actions menu which can be confusing at times. Once you figure out the controls and the menu, you learn to harvest. Harvesting has a Minecraft feel to it (Never even played Minecraft!). The biggest issue with the game is rendering, which ties into the Minecraft feel. Crop renders in square patches and when plowing, some parts of the field don't get plowed right. Plowing and harvesting evenly is an issue, as well. You can ""hire a worker"", but expect to pay them on $3-4,000+ per field, which is rediculous. And sometimes, they're worthless. So, you harvest and either fill your storage with crop, or travel to businesses to sell your harvest. If you're in the negative cash-wise, you'll pay back your worker before making profit. If you took a loan out, you can pay it back $5,000 at a time. So you plow, wait, harvest and store or sell your crop to try to break even or profit, so you can buy more equipment, which is reasonably priced. You will get odd missions like mowing or forklift, mowing is okay, but the controls for the forklift are a pain on keys and mouse. By the way, took forever to realise not only did I need the blue tractor and forks, but also needed to buy the arms as well. WHAT THE HELL?! Couldn't just make it 1 or 2 purchases! Oh, and if you didn't ralise the weights are supposed to help keep your tractor from tipping and you so happen to tip it, no GTA style unflipping. Hit i for inventory/info and search for tractors owned. Then hit ""Reset"", which takes your equipment back to your farm. I'm sure there's more for me to nitpick at, but my biggest issure is paid DLC for a halfassed kind of ugly looking game that isn't really worth the $17 I paid for on sale. This game may be worth $5-10 for slight enjoyment. Don't expect a bunch of acheivements, either. Short short list. In conclusion, mediocre graphics, horrible rendering, nowhere near simulation worthy, lack of tutorials during playtime, overly complicated controls and ♥♥♥♥ing pointless DLC. For my time spent, I can give it 4/10. But even giving it a 4 is being generous. I'd skip it, unless you can get an easy refund.			"

												Perhaps the Very Best Simulator game out there. It's very in depth in the field management with abilities to expand into other areas of farming like tree farming, green houses, and even solar/wind farming. The game can be played solely as a crop farm, tree farm, animal farm, or as all types above. There's also a very active modding community which the game developers seem to pay attention to and add popular things to the game in updates and/or DLC.			"

												What a great, different and fun gaming experience. If you grew up around farms this game will bring back some good memories. It is also great to enjoy together with your friends or on your own when you are running a successful business in singleplayer. I especially enjoy the high quality of the 3D models within the game.I would highly suggest to look up the many free (!) mods for this game created by the community (vehicles, maps, placeables, game improvements, ...) - They really expand the gaming experience and give you a lot of new equipment to try out!Some minor cons I have found:- The ambient AI traffic is a little bit awkward in its behavior.- For high-end computers the graphic settings are too basic and restricted. (Tip: You can greatly extend draw, view and shadow distance by manually editing settings in the mapXX.i3d files found in the game folder using the Notepad. This should really be an option to edit using the in-game menu, though!)- Even though I don't operate real tractors, the acceleration feels a little bit too intense and fast. Steering could also feel a little bit 'heavier'.Besides these, I really love the game and I especially like the community supporting it with great mods!			"

The tractors can't be damaged, the physics are terrible. If you turn over one of your vehicles they just straight up for themselves.Please devs, strip simulator out of this game's name and put something like Farming Managing 2015.

												Great graphics but Giants needs to start to focus on different crops as wellas more of a real Career where maybe we compete against other farmers or need to buy the land directl from them. But more so then anything they need to have a career mode were you can buy your house and upgrade it as you see fit.			"

												Farming Simulator 2015:This is without doubt the best farming simulation game out there.I wasn't sure about this game at first but it is definitely worth it. At first the game starts slow with little money and things get repetitive, but once you start expanding your farm it's much more exciting and fun.Pros:-Lots of machinery-Multiplayer-Attention to detail in the models and map- Vehicles have more weight-Vehicles get dirty and leave tracksCons:-It runs great but sometimes FPS will drop. (Might just be my system)Overall, it is a great game for just relaxing and doing some farming. I recommend this game.			"

												I bought this for my 10 year old son loves these kinds of games, but then I played it to see what it was all about...At some point, I realized I had been playing for hours and didn't want to stop until my next wheat harvest was done, but wait, I just started the canola, oh crap, I need to cut down these trees because the hired workers are getting stuck, wait a second, when was the last time I fed the sheep, oh and...... Damn game will suck you in!I'm really suprised at how good this game is. There is an endless amount of stuff to do, and the gameplay mechanics work quite well. The enviroment is beautiful; at one point I stopped for a couple minutes to admire sunset, with dandilion seeds drifing by and the crop swaying in the breeze. Also, the 3d modeling of the equipment is extremely detailed. There are lots of moving parts, and it looks like every single nut and bolt is modeled on every item. It's all very well done. I never would have imagined that I'd be all that interested in this game, but it's really pretty engrossing.			"

												Their isn't much to this game. It's very low stress and relaxing. Put on some tunes, plow your fields, milk your cows or whatever you want to do to earn money. Then buy better equipment or more plots of land. Rinse and repeat. Logging will earn you the most money by far of anything you can do, however it's pretty buggy, at least it is on my end. I have to save and save often. I even have a tree that I had to leave on the ground  (part of it is actually hovering in mid air) because I was unable to move it once I sawed it in segments. So be careful with that. I have not tried The Scorpion yet, but the controls on the basic logging equipment took me the better part of two hours to hang of. I've pretty much just giving up on logging despite the money, and only use it as a supplemental income to pay for my labor costs and let my fields and livestock be my main source of income. If you're looking for a low stress fun little game and something that's very kid friendly this is it.			"

												First off i would just like to state that this type of game is not for everyone. If you have no interest in farming or machines you would not like this game.  This is not a bad game it has had small improvements over the previous one. IMO it should not stand alone as a new game. It does not have new maps. They put some new machines in and features. I can understand that people spend time developing games and deserve compensation. I just do not think that this game deserves to be labeled as a new game. Most of the features in it should have come out with free patches. I will thumbs up this game because it is different and not as intense as other games a relaxing game to play inbetween more intense games.			"

												I played this game for longer than I probably should have.  Strangely engaging for a while but this game has no surprises at all.  It's exactly what it looks like, exactly what you think it is.  Here are some good things:  * Realistic looking equipment.  I wouldn't know how accurate this stuff is, but it's how I imagine this stuff would look.  Very fine details.  * Time destroyer.  If you have too much free time on your hands, you can waste quite a lot of it here.  *  A wide range of farming and farming related equipment to admire.  Now for my many gripes:  * The AI gets stuck on anything and everything.  They can't figure out how to back up and go around stuff even a little.  You really need them though, so you spend a good bit of time baby sitting them.  *  Buggy trees.  The logging is a cool part of the game, but often very frustrating.  Making my wheel loader flip 50 feet into the air was pretty funny though.  Really the whole process of logging could have used some fine tuning, or just a way to feed stuff into the chipper automatically.  * Cryptic.  The tutorials don't explain much and you are left to walk alone.  The store menu is pretty pathetic, they should have included more info on each piece of machinery and explained them a little better.    *Speaking of purchases, this game has a lot of DLC.  I can't find any mods on Steam, but there is sure a  lot of DLC.  Considering that buying new equipment is the ENTIRETY of the goal in this game, I feel that this DLC is especially terrible and stupid.  *Everything.  The ""career"" mode isn't a career mode at all, the missions are a joke.  It' s a sandbox with no goals of any kind.  I really wasn't looking for much in this area, but there is just nothing.  Once you've bought the best equipment there is no incentive to actually use any of it.  The game is over at that point.   This game is close.  It's so close to being actually fun to play, but I just can't recommend it.  Needs just a pinch of endgame, or plot, or something to keep it interesting.   Basically, if you really like looking at tractors, this is the game for you.  If you like grinding for hours toward a goal that is increasingly ethereal and pointless, here you go.			"

												I've been playing this game to hold me over til the inevitable Cyber Monday sale on FS17, and man is it still fun. Got this a while ago and stopped playing for one reason or another but happy to get back to it. Really no reason to get this over FS17 which improves upon this game in every area. But just wanted to finally give this game the positive rating it deserves			"

												The idea of this game is good. But it's engine is terrible. Worst engine ever for a simulator.It's impossible to say this game is a SIM, they should remove this part of their game's name. The tractors can't be damaged, the physics are terrible. If you turn over one of your vehicles they just straight up for themselves.Please devs, strip simulator out of this game's name and put something like Farming Managing 2015. There is no simulation whatsoever in this game.			"

												Baah, you need to farm alot to get money.....Jokes aside. Here it is.Info:The game let's you take control over a farm with some bad quiality equipment. You have to harvest, cultivate, sow and fertilize the fields to generate income. This is done with the equipment and YOU are driving them. For a lot of boring tasks you can hire bots to do it for you, for a fee of course. Bring your friends and farm togheter. It will be alot more fun.When the cash starts to roll in you can buy more equipment, or sell of some old junk and buy better stuff. Or maybe a new field. The choice is yours.Pros:-Lot's of equipment to play around with.-a ""#¤%load of mods are avaible if you get tired of the ingame equipment. (Including new maps)-Graphics are not incredible, but i'm ok with it. -A good balance between realism and dynamics.Cons:-A.I might be a bit stupid sometimes.-Wierd lag in Multiplayer (Might be my friends connection/computer. Still investigating)-To few crops.Summary:A really good game, especially if you are interested in farming. The pros are weighting alot more then the cons. 10/10 would farm again. "

												EDIT: Changed review, see notes below.It was fun right up until I decided to do forestry. Then it went horribly wrong. Spent hours trying to get a tree into the wood chipper. It was like there was an invisble block in the way. I'm not the only one either, based on forum posts I've read. It's just not worth the amount of time I spent trying to figure it out. The rest of it is fun enough, but I can tell already that it will become a massive grind for very little point. Overall, I can't recommend it, to be honest. If, however, you're hard core into simulators then I'd at least suggest you wait for a really good sale.UPDATE: After playing some more, and finding a couple of forestry mods I am changing this to a recommend. The recent patch helped as well. Check around for various mods, they enhance the experience quite a bit.			"

												This would be even more amazing if it was made cross-game, so people playing Train Sim are controlling the trains and Construction Sim players are buildling buildings on the same map that we are farming on. The maps would need to be much bigger so that everyone can play on the same maps. As you start the game, you would need to select and purchase a plot of land to play. It would be incredible! If you ever do run with this idea, contact me as I'd love to help with ideas.			"

												Let's see where to start. This game is relaxing and fun even though the idea is very basic. Some things like patato harvesting could be made a little less annoything but this game is amazing. I have a ton of games in my library and when I get bored and try to think of a game to play that is fun and passes time I think of Farming Sim 15. There are times i plan on playiing 30 mins and I end up playing 8 hours XD I highly recommend this game			"

												EDIT: Changed review, see notes below.It was fun right up until I decided to do forestry. Then it went horribly wrong. Spent hours trying to get a tree into the wood chipper. It was like there was an invisble block in the way. I'm not the only one either, based on forum posts I've read. It's just not worth the amount of time I spent trying to figure it out. The rest of it is fun enough, but I can tell already that it will become a massive grind for very little point. Overall, I can't recommend it, to be honest. If, however, you're hard core into simulators then I'd at least suggest you wait for a really good sale.UPDATE: After playing some more, and finding a couple of forestry mods I am changing this to a recommend. The recent patch helped as well. Check around for various mods, they enhance the experience quite a bit.			"

												10/10 Farming Simulator 15 is what it's best at being a farming simulator and it executes it to perfection; It can only possibly get better, a huge thank you is in order. I payed for a farming simulator and you really do trully get just what it is, if a farming simulator is something you think you might be interested in, definitely pick this game up. If your not really into farming than this game is still worth a try, you might like it. I've been very happy with my purchase of the game, and I'm sure you will be to. Pop on some great country toons, and enjoy living in the true experience of farming.I have had no issues while playing this game, and the mod support can help to make certain tasks a little easier.

												Graphically astonishing compared to the previous release, the interface is also vastly improved.  The main map appears to be new but I prefer the large swaths of land available in the 'American' map... that being said, the autopilot provided by the 'Hire' button is buggy, either the tractor stops every few meters, or simply skips large swaths of the field.  The really cool tree thrashing machine only works with 1 specific type of tree (booooo).  Overall the gameplay is just as good as previous releases and I look forward to burning many more hours playing this game at least until I get all the achievements.			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is a grindy and time-consuming game. You start with a small harvester and few tractors and work your way up to more powerful machines, that will make your work more efficient and give larger yields. Besides growing various grains you can also have animals (chickens, sheep and cows). Chickens don't need care, sheep need grass to eat and cows are the ones most profitable and also needs some of your time. Later you can specialize in producing silage - it can be mixed with hay and straw as food for the cows or used as fuel for the biogas plant. The choice is yours.If you liked Eurotruck Simulator or Elite Dangerous or grindy games in general, try this one out. It has basic tutorials about how to work your fields and what equipment to use. There are some good guides too if you google them. It's not a very complex game and easy to get into. In the game you can hire a worker to do the work for you (most of the time), but there are some tasks that require you to do them manually.I've played it in single player mode, even if the game has possibility for multiplayer. The DLC's don't add much to the game, as most of the DLC equipment have the same functionality than the ones in the base game. The Gold expansion adds a map and I don't have it, nor need it. There's a thriving modding community for Farming Simulator 2015 that will cater to your wishes.			"

												It's a good game, but it shouldn't be rated as a SIMULATOR.Let's get to the point why i've said that.First of all, the game UI is average and could be much better organized and displayed. Also, the scenery is very poor when it comes to interactivity with objects or places.Your crops grow in a matter of days and they have cycles, you just need to plant and crop, you don't need to check weather, time, soil, seeds or nothing like Sim Farm, where you had to check and decides lots of stuff even before planting.This game is not bad, but, for sure, it doesn't have the characteristics to be considered a SIM.

												No I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless they were looking for exactly this type of game.  It can be fun, but it's one of those games you have to repeatedly start over on until you figure out the basics that should have been explained in the tutorial level.  Couple of things you might wanna know before hand.  The default harvester only works on wheat, barley and canola.  Everything else requires EXPENSIVE items that you can't afford from the shop.  No one will warn you against planting other things, but you can do it just as easily as anything else.  The '8' key speeds up time, the '7' key slows down time.  Note that construction will not happen faster if you do this.  It will only make the crops grow faster and animals produce faster.  You don't have to buy any animal pastures, you own them all by default on every map.  To buy animals go to the shop which can be found on the map when you hit the '9' key.  The animals are hidden away in the far right of the shop's menu.  Try not to sell any crops until their prices have gone up.  Only keep an above negative budget in the meantime.  buy chickens as soon as possible.  They're a nice easy source of income early in the game.  Apparently, you don't actually see all the chickens you purchased in the coop but they're there.  They produce more eggs as a result of there being more of them.  Even though you can't see more chickens...			"

												This game is preety much dead. Developers/producers seems to be giving up on it, one patch since release, and still a whole bunch of bugs. They are just milking the name for what it's good for.The community was keeping this game alive with mods, but seems to be giving up since there are way to many changes between versions and to much work goes into making mods work year after year. I myself have done a few mods which were/are very popular, but can't be bothered anymore, since the developers doesn't seem to be either.This game has (had) so much potential and with every release since 2011 it lost some, it's the simcity of farming sims... I just hope they sell the whole thing to someone who cares and who can make something good out of it. Or someone makes a decent rival prodict.Bought the all until now, but this is the last one.			"

												Really disapointing, potentially a great game but poor graphics and worse optimisation. With a water cooled I5 4570k, 16gig 1600mhz ram and a 2gig 7870HD I can run all games in the high settings, I can play The Shadow of Mordor with the 4k pack but Farming Simulator 2015 the game chugs along on medium settings with a poor frame rate and a stuttering image. I really wanted to enjoy this, I have tried 4 times to start a career but nope the poor performance is a killer.			"

												Farmville on steroids.   If you want to learn about farming, this is a pretty good game to teach you about all the equipment out there and how the whole farming process works.   As far as being fun...well...for me, it was about as much fun as actually farming.   I'll give this a recommend to buy as long as it's on sale for less than $10 because some of you out there might actually like the boring day to day farming stuff.			"

												First impressions.HUGE WASTE OF MONEY.Installed the game through Steam, attempted to start, keep getting an error about not being able to copy an XML config file.So, tried creating the folder manually, copied files over manually.Game now starts, but mouse is tracking WAY off.   As in, I have to hover the pointer an inch higher and to the left to select anything.Changes to the options will not save.  Make changes, click 'Save', game exits and restarts, but still on default settings.   All changes made (after fighting with mouse pointer being off) are simply tossed out.Talk about some AWFUL development!!!!			"

												What the hell has happened to my life?  Seriously, what?  A few short days ago I was just Average Schmoe Number Twenty-Six, working a typical city job in a typical city.  Today I woke up and threw on some flannel and some suspenders and topped it off with a New Holland hat and a can of FarmBoi Chewing Tobacco.  Yes folks, this is what you can expect from Farming Simulator 15.  I didn't know the first thing about farming, but liked the idea of building an empire in a small open world.  I'd seen some streams, and the streamers seemed to enjoy themselves...so I jumped in thinking it would be a fun diversion.Thirty hours of instant addiction later I'm an unshaven, scraggly mess of a man; swearing when I overturn my tractor and gathering chicken eggs in my spare time. Recently I've begun the descent into ""silage,"" which is basically fermented grass that is becoming liquid gold in the era of biofuels.  Soon it will be time to graduate into cows and forestry, at which point I will have abandoned all pretense of city life and run off for life as a farmhand. It's been nice knowing you all.			"

You skip the tutorial thinking you know how to play, and bam, you don't figure out how to play this game. If you are someone returning to the series, give it a try, but if not, go with another game.			"

												Baby steps for improvements, but incredibly well polished over the last game. The interface has imporved immensly, the auto cruise control is nice, the new engine changes are subtle but pleasent, and the dirt is a suprisngly immersive experience coupled with the new terrain and plant animations. Still feels a little to similar to the last game, but the addition of forestry, amazing new map, intuitive mutilpayer settings, as well as the re-vamped old map more than makes up for it. Having open mod support will help carry this game far as well.			"

												The game would be awesome but for Giant's refusal to support Logitech G27 Racing Wheel.  For that matter, they won't even respond to you when you do try to get help.For those of you in my position, the only thing you can do is reformat your hard drive, reinstal everything, and then do not under any circumstances reinstal lgs510 _64x; Its the update that allows you to use the gear shifter with its plethora of function buttons as well as the 6 function buttons on the steering wheel.

												The current release of GIANTS farming simulator 2015, is really bad, and they obviuosly don't give a crap about making a nice simulator. The previous versions of the game had alot of things missing, due to a pretty low budget. But with the massive sales on Farming Simulator 2013, one would have expected them to do a really good job this time, now that they had the funds. They havent though. They've done quite the contrary to be exact. There is absolutely nothing new in the newest version of the farming sim, and im mad i even bought the game. It is basically just the 2013 with a bit more shiny graphics. They havent implemented one thing, of what their fans asked for,  and they should be ashamed of realeasing this product. Here a small list what they could have done, the last two years, but didnt.- Improve the AI. Make it able to do more than just driving back and forth. The AI Still can't drive on the road, and this totally kills the game, because you have to empty the combine by yourself all the time, leaving no time for anything else. It doesnt matter if you got 10 or a 100 fields. You can't tend to them, because the AI cant do a simple task such as driving on the roads, and unloading combines.- Physics is still♥♥♥♥♥♥ The Tractors handle like boxcars, and they also dont support any sort of damage system. So basically there is no consquence driving straight into a tree with 42 km/t. There we modders in the 2013 version that could do a better job, than the GIANTS team has done. [Im of course talking about the lovely More Realistic mod for those curious]- No new animals. Its still the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 3 animals, same as the Farming Sim 2013 version. There is no breeding or any of that sort, and only 3 animals. Really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on their part again. Again, they had two years, but they accomplished nothing. Lets venture on with the list.-No advanced economy aspect. You're still limited to borrowing and paying money back, at a fixed rate.- The tractors still sound ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. There is no gearshift, just this one boring noise. They havenet even implemented manual transmisson and clutch. Something alot of people were hoping for. Afterall, this is supposed to be a Simulator. Also the tractors accelerates really weird. They're slow in the beginning, then they accelrate like they had a rocket on them. Really weird.- It is still not posible, altering the terrain in any way, other than cutting down trees (Big whoop. We already got a mod for this in 2013)This is just a few of the things they didnt do. Heres some of the things they did do:- Implemented tree cutting, which is very nice. But there is already a mod for this in the 2013 version. - Made AI worse. Now they wont even finish the field, if the implement cant fit on the last bit. This could have been avoided by making the tractor follow the edge of the field instead, but no.- Impoved graphics (Barely though. everything is a bit more fancy, and we got sidemirrors now. But really it doesnt matter. I would have picked gameplay instead over graphics any day)- Made it easier for people to mod their games. (Which is very nice. But im worried they are trying to make people make their own game, releving them of doing anything else but collecting money, when really, they did nothing)-Improved HUD. But really doesnt matter. I'd rather they had improved the gameplay.So basically, GIAANTS took the FS2013 version, and shined it up a bit, and then released it as a whole new farming sim, even though there is nothing new in it, at all. And they used two years doing this. Two years and they got nothing. It's very clear they dont give a flying F*** about their customers anymore, and i'm sad by the state of the game, and their blatant disregard for making a decent product. I give this product 0 out of 5 stars, and i do not recommend anyone buying this. Have you never played the other versions though, you might enjoy this one, as everything is still new to you.Thank you.			"

												Obviously you need to be a farmer with several years of experience to understand this game.  Or at least played  first 14 games. I am new to this one. The game gives you basic intro and then you are on your own. I don’t understand anything. The interface is stupid. Your equipment is not marked on the map so if you forget where you leave something you will just have your luck to find them. Same goes for the spots where you refill. Complete bull****. Is this your first game ever??? If you are new to farming or to gaming in farming simulator, this game is definitely not for you.			"

												REVIEW is for the G27 support, not the game itself entirely, which would be rated as really good if they didn't go lazy mode, and went for the Official FS15 Steering wheel instead of adding support.Overall good game, BUT!The widely used G27.. is not supported, what the actual.. fffffuark, how did they not think about adding support for it?! ETS did, ETS2 did, most driving sims supports it.. while this does not.. I have trouble driving precisely, because I had to disable force feedback by disabling the power to the wheel, but this leads to other bigger issues, which you should be able to figure out what that is,Also the game feels.... very, hmm, dead, I don't know how to explain that.. it just.. you know, does.But the overall farming aspect is really well done, the programmers did an excellent job with the tile destruction.Recommended for users with other wheels than the G27.

												One of the greatest games of all time.  I've quit my job to play full time.  I believe that, with the right amount of dedication and practice, I can become one of the greatest virtual farmers in history.  ...But seriously, I've only just become aware of this title from a few weeks ago.  Played 2013 until my fingers bled.  Love the gameplay and the 'zen' quality involved with plowing, cultivating, seeding, fertilizing and reaping.  Love it. This is completely different than some of the other games I've played in the past (Skyrim, FO: NV) and I think it's a great tool for thinking about the work that takes place around the world on a daily basis to help feed the population. I'll be playing this one for some time to come, I think.  If you're looking for something different than the usual, you should pick this up.			"

												I thought it would be fun and relaxing, maybe similar to Sims, but it's not.You spend your time driving a tractor around plowing fields, sowing the seeds, spreading cow poop, and then waiting to harvest so you can start over. I tried to like the game, but driving around large fields at 10 MPH makes it very dry for me. It took me around 30 mins of driving back and forth just to plow 1 field. that doesn't include sowing the seeds. The tutorials don't help much. They will teach you to farm, but nothing about forestry.			"

												Farming Simulator is a great improvement to Farming Simulator 2013. Even though you will recognize the game, new features have added and both graphics and physics have been improved.Logging is a great addition to the game, and might be a good way to kickstart you economy, as long as you don´t invest in more than the absolutely minimum of equipment.I love the Farming Simulator games for giving me a way to relax and unwind whilst gaming, but still giving me enough of a challenge.Figuring out the mechanisms of the game are fun challenges, and lifting those logs on the the trailer is not that easy - especially not when you also have crops withering and unsold wheat in the silos with prices falling.The life of a digital farmer is both fun and challenging in Farming Simulator - and you get to drive big harvesters! :-)			"

												Haven't played too many hours yet, so my first impressions will be the ones I air here in this review.One thing I really miss is a ""scenarios"" section where you have to battle some really great challenges like ""get out of debt"" or some other challenge that really takes ingenuity.I realize that there are more difficulty levels in this game, and I will try them all, but scenarios that you have to fight through would be really nice.Generally, I'm positive about this game, but not all is glorious:Pros:- The technology of the ""beginner"" vehicles is no longer ancient so getting up and running is faster than with for instance FS13- Improved graphics for sure- Physics are much better. now you can't just drive everywhere over hills and mountains (add to the realism)- Energy consumption of addons, again adds to the realism, and does make this game harder, meaning more paytime before you just get filthy rich- A new map - Forestry (haven't been there yet so can't say it that in itself is good or bad)- Missions don't pop up on your screen, you have to go find them (I know some people will argue that ""but you could say they come as texts on your mobile). I like the fact that they don't pop up in my head and interrupt my gameplay all the time- UI much nicer and things have been toned downCons:- The tutorial does not cover the actual logging part which is very weird since that's one of the selling points of the game. - Not that many new placeables, actually the only new things are, very expensive, trees- In general, the farming items are the same. I know that they do resemble actual parts, so it's hard for the devs to ""invent"" stuff, but could add extra cars and such.- When resetting items they should be returned to ""original factory setings"" for instance when you've had to reset an add-on due to it having flipped over.- One of the BIG ones: Give me the option to build my own farm from scratch. Let me try to face the challenge of building a farm on my own land. I realize that this might need to have some ""step by step"" pre-determined sections wherer to place stuff or a terra-forming option, but being ""given"" this huge farm just takes a lot of the personal touch away.Conclusion:All in all, the pros clearly outweigh the cons so I definitely recommend this, also if you have the FS13 or earlier.This game presents some new challenges, especially with the power consumption of add-ons.Until of course you decide to get the ""follow me"" mod and other things that makes it ridiculously easy.

												Well What can i say.The game engine has been updated quite a bit the Physics appear to work.  the new lighting for the game is great the tractors look less like models more like the real thing.  The tractors acumulate dirt which is a nice touch but what struck me the most is the in cab view now that has been updated considrably you have a working REV counter and a Speedometer the interers are crisp.As the harvesting and farming It can easly be done all in cab the working mirrors are handy indeed. The tractor even sports working turn signals plus you can set them to hazard.The tractors leave tracks on the gournd that appear to stay Quite a while.  Also buying larger machinary than your tractor can handle just does not work you need the correct tractor HP wise to handle the ewuipment.All I can say is Thank you Giants you have done a marvelous job in this version of Farming Simulator.

												Good Game. Meet expectations in terms of gameplay and graphics, though lacks som NPC competition (or something like in The Sims).On the good side:Much lees grinding and much more interesting gameplay as result of ability to hire an NPC workers.  On the bad side:Though the game includes upkeep costs, it does not have any damage or wear management; that is, everything of your gear is indestructible and no fines for collisions, rolled-over vehicles or fallen objects (like pallets, which should be destroyed resulting in mission failure).

												FS 2015 is quite an enjoyable and immersive simulation experience. It offers many vehicles, implements and heavy equipment for both farming and lumbering. As well as an intuitive way of customizing your farm.

												Farming Simulator is a great improvement to Farming Simulator 2013. Even though you will recognize the game, new features have added and both graphics and physics have been improved.Logging is a great addition to the game, and might be a good way to kickstart you economy, as long as you don´t invest in more than the absolutely minimum of equipment.I love the Farming Simulator games for giving me a way to relax and unwind whilst gaming, but still giving me enough of a challenge.Figuring out the mechanisms of the game are fun challenges, and lifting those logs on the the trailer is not that easy - especially not when you also have crops withering and unsold wheat in the silos with prices falling.The life of a digital farmer is both fun and challenging in Farming Simulator - and you get to drive big harvesters! :-)			"

												Haven't played too many hours yet, so my first impressions will be the ones I air here in this review.One thing I really miss is a ""scenarios"" section where you have to battle some really great challenges like ""get out of debt"" or some other challenge that really takes ingenuity.I realize that there are more difficulty levels in this game, and I will try them all, but scenarios that you have to fight through would be really nice.Generally, I'm positive about this game, but not all is glorious:Pros:- The technology of the ""beginner"" vehicles is no longer ancient so getting up and running is faster than with for instance FS13- Improved graphics for sure- Physics are much better. now you can't just drive everywhere over hills and mountains (add to the realism)- Energy consumption of addons, again adds to the realism, and does make this game harder, meaning more paytime before you just get filthy rich- A new map - Forestry (haven't been there yet so can't say it that in itself is good or bad)- Missions don't pop up on your screen, you have to go find them (I know some people will argue that ""but you could say they come as texts on your mobile). I like the fact that they don't pop up in my head and interrupt my gameplay all the time- UI much nicer and things have been toned downCons:- The tutorial does not cover the actual logging part which is very weird since that's one of the selling points of the game. - Not that many new placeables, actually the only new things are, very expensive, trees- In general, the farming items are the same. I know that they do resemble actual parts, so it's hard for the devs to ""invent"" stuff, but could add extra cars and such.- When resetting items they should be returned to ""original factory setings"" for instance when you've had to reset an add-on due to it having flipped over.- One of the BIG ones: Give me the option to build my own farm from scratch. Let me try to face the challenge of building a farm on my own land. I realize that this might need to have some ""step by step"" pre-determined sections wherer to place stuff or a terra-forming option, but being ""given"" this huge farm just takes a lot of the personal touch away.Conclusion:All in all, the pros clearly outweigh the cons so I definitely recommend this, also if you have the FS13 or earlier.This game presents some new challenges, especially with the power consumption of add-ons.Until of course you decide to get the ""follow me"" mod and other things that makes it ridiculously easy.

												It's a pretty solid simulator overall, I think the ""forestry"" function was rushed a bit, because it doesn't seem like it was well thought out before putting it into the release.

												Good Game. Meet expectations in terms of gameplay and graphics, though lacks som NPC competition (or something like in The Sims).On the good side:Much lees grinding and much more interesting gameplay as result of ability to hire an NPC workers.  On the bad side:Though the game includes upkeep costs, it does not have any damage or wear management; that is, everything of your gear is indestructible and no fines for collisions, rolled-over vehicles or fallen objects (like pallets, which should be destroyed resulting in mission failure). I like to return to playing this game from time to time.Buy it on sale.			"

												Farming Simulator 15 is the first Farming Simulator I've played. While I have to say I'm somewhat impressed with the graphics, parts of the game are repetitive, such as taking crops to sell, or tilling a field. You can hire farm workers to do these jobs if you have enough money or your equipment is efficient enough.All in all, I'd say it's fairly entertaining, especially for someone like me who knows little about farming or the equipment involved. I was also surprised ot find a large part of the game is more like forrestry simulator, though I guess technically you can farm trees.Also, keep in mind, this is ""Farming Simulator"" not ""Farm Simulator.""  I was personally disappointed, after my first long day behind the manure spreader, (yes really in the game), I wasn't able to go home and knock my wife's remaining teeth out or commit incest. You can't even go inside your farm house.If you're looking for a simulation of farm life, you'll have to look elsewhere, this only covers the act of farming.			"

												Not just 'not recommended' but 'HIGHLY Not recommended'This was my first exposure to this franchise, and figured it would enjoy the support and growth of its previous installments.   It does not.  The game is IDENTICAL to the day it was released and lacks some key features one would expect of a 'Farming Business' game.  There have been a few DLCs released for purchase, but they ONLY contain more of the same equipment or mabe in the future a new map.  No new functionality!There is a large modding community, but byand large from what I can see they never moved on to FS15, choosing to stay with previous FS...which I can understand as the games are pretty well identical except for logging.  As such the modding community for FS15 is pretty much just specialized equipment and a few handy mods for field management.  But no large scale overhauls to introduce anything you would associate with a 'Farming Simulator' such as need for any Herbicide, crop rotation, soil quality, or even an effect of weather on harvesting or planting.Seriously.  Just skip this one.			"

												I give a thumbs up to the ""Farming Simulator"" franchise.The reasons are:1- Its absolutly relaxing gameplay, the closest you can get to nature without leaving the house.2- It is by far the most deep game that can still be played ""passivly"", meaning you can fullfil other life duties such as reading/ studying and still enjoy this game in the background.3- Has enough activities to engage you when you have more time and choose to play more ""activly"".4- Even provides multiplayer to enjoy with friends!5- Very educational for urban people like me who never even knew a thing or 2 about farming.I will gladly recommend all the versions even today: 2011, 2013, 2015 every game has a set of achievments and the older it is the more basic the gameplay is. So if you are new to the franchise you can happily start from the oldest one but if you are looking for eye candy of course the newer look better ;)			"

												Farming simulator have always been an oddball in the gaming genre.Its main appeal is playing with heavy machinery, and often you discover nice engineering techniques that went into the real deal.The coop part of Farming Simulator series is also great fun, and the physics will often throw you for a loop of laughs.At the present I can't recommend you buy the 2015 version of the game, if you fancy playing with a Farming Simulator game, you should pick up the 2013 instead and slap on some mods.At present, the 2015 is very unstable, and will regulary crash every 2 hours at least, without an autosave mod you will often lose a lot of work.There are no acknowledgement to these crashes by the devs, despite loads of crash reports, part of the problem is that it lies deep down in the game engine, and thus doesn't produce any errors in the log, and I guess they interpret that as ""Oh there is no problem""These crashes happen on games that have zero mods as well, so they aren't a factor in the crashes.FS 2013 is stable, and the only thing that can destabilize and ruin it is mods, but you can fix that by stripping out the offending mod, it is much harder if the problem lies with the core game.Until there is a patch, I recommend you stay away from this game, or at the very least, only consider it at 75% or more sale.

												In Minecraft you can automate farm production and maintenance, and resource collection. (Granted you need some mods)Couldn't find a way to automate anything here beyond 1 worker working on 1 field. If I had 100 fields - I would have to have 100 tractors and endlessly press ""H"" key to hire workers... I believe gaming should evolve towards greater complexity and greater utilization of Artificial Intelligence technology. For a game like Farming Simulator - it makes sense that I am unable to achieve complete automation when I have 1 farm, however assuming I have all the farms on the map - I see no reason why I should be driving a tractor with a carriage to collect grain from EVERY HARVESTER EVERY TIME they are full.In my opinion a video game that takes such a hard stance against using AI isn't worth recommending.

												The game does not offer a lot compared to the previous in terms of gameplay. The graphics are a lot nicer, but gameplay still suffers from a very poor physicsmodel, a totally lack of intelligence from the workers. They apparently only do square fields. They are not intelligent enough to drive to the field on their own and start doing their stuff. You always have to check up on them - otherwise they will end up in a fence. Trying to drive through a tree etc. It was the same in 2013, but I had hoped they fixed it, but apparently the graphics was their primary concern. With all the flaws, it should still be in beta and untill they make the game more intelligent, this game is only good in multiplayer mode.			"

												Once you've played one Farming Simulator, you've played them all.  They haven't changed the format for years and it's old news now.  Compared to how a real farm works, Farming Sim is very simplistic, where as in real life farming is damn hard work with a never ending list of things to do.  It's about maximising the potential of the farm and developing the business side. Farming sim is just plant reap, plant reap, plant reap etc, etc, etc, with tree cutting to try and stem the boredom.If you've never played a farming sim then get this, but make sure you cross it off the bucket list because once you've played one you've played them all.

												First off: I love the game. It's pretty awesome concept, and very different from what people normally play. It's refreshing to play something relaxing and not intense like your usual FPS.I still don't recommend it though. Why? There are several reasons.The engine is absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY atrocious. It's a joke for a game that came out in 2014. Even on relatively high end PC (i7 3770K and R9 290) I can't get stable 60 fps (and no, it's not my fault). Sometimes framerate dips to 20-30 temporarily when switching vehicle lights on (wtf?). Or by simply turning around. Sometimes when simply looking in some direction it drops to mid 30's.All of that in a game where everything but the vehicle models is an absolute joke. Trees almost look 2D with perfectly hexagonal trunks to give you just one of many examples. Actually, watch this:

			Den Elch im LS15 gibt es wirklich.		

Draw distance is so horribly low you can see circles around you where textures change into lower detail (yes that's possible). Trees and anything else on the map simply suddenly pops in instead of fading in and out at least somewhat. Textures are so low resolution they change into blurry mess when you get closer. Sometimes I think they were done by an autist on some bad drugs in MsPaint.The company is very, very relaxed about releasing patches. The game IS (or at least it seems like it) under constant development, you get a DLC (paid or even free) once in a while, which is great, BUT the game is plagued by tons of more or less annoying bugs which get completely ignored despite being repeatedly brought up in the forums. What's worse, patches are only released once in several months.For some unknown reason the company doesn't use english as the primary language to communicate with the customers, and unless you understand german, you often completely miss out on very important stuff, for example upcoming patches. Some things simply ONLY appear in the german section of the forums. That's extremely weird approach from a company that releases a game internationally and whose employees know at least basic english (the company is swiss I believe).			"

												Blatant rehash of FS2013, same maps, less machinery (my guess is they waiting to rip us off with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dlc pack) forestry addition has been ripped off from teh FS2013 modding community and is frustratingly buggy. Cut down a tree and it stays upright, you have to knock it over with a tractor, wood chipper refuses to accept wood 99% of the time and when it does it leaves most of teh log on teh bed of the wood chipper. all tracked vehicles slide down hills when stationary, driving any vehicles is like driving on ice, welcome to jack knife simulator. no new crops despite the modding community manageing to add more crops in EVERY version of this game yet the devs seem unable to. blatant lie about animal husbandry, IE NONE. maps are identical to previous versions. no new animals, apparentley teh devs must be muslim as pigs dont exist in the world in which they live in. the list of known bugs on teh giants forum is about two pages long and english tech support is non existant, if your german then its fine but any other language and your Scheiße outta Glück. all in all I hope Giants software and all its developers and marketing team die in a fiery napalm explosion. DO NOT BUY THIS DOG TURD! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.			"

												I've played this game for some time. Developer Doesnt seem to want to fix the physics engine! Any vehicle acts like its on a skating rink. Sheep pallets still have an issues with its phisics. On hill surfaces tracktors slowly slide down hill. Graphics on a premium system are glitchy at best.( played on multiple computers) Wouldnt be a bad game if developer put patches out to fix an incomplete game. The only thing I've seen are DLC's but no patches to fix the problems that the game came with. Sorry Giant I've played Farm Simulator 2013 and your new simulator and have seen no real patches to fix problems with your software! Its been out for a while and you've had tons of time to fix things but your only working on DLC's?			"

												good, much better than prevous FS games, however it still lacks, buggy as hell. 33 dollar game plus the dlc makes it a 60 dollar game. seeing as its being released on console as well for xbox one and ps4, for 54.99, which makes it just as expensive as big titles such as GTA or COD. This game is lacking in every department, its like an early access but its not actually early access, atleast they dont mention that it is. All they put in for new economy, is woodcutting. nothing special at all. 3 animals is all you can raise, what about pigs, turkey, horses, what about exotic animals like lions and tigers and bears. What about john deere equipment? all player mods suck♥♥♥♥♥and have horrible bugs,  I would highly suggest not buying this game until they make massive improvements such as vehicle physics, bug fixes, clipping glitches, anti gravity bugs. only buy if you want a half♥♥♥♥♥game.

												Way too complicated. It's very difficult to figure out what to do and when, and way too cumbersome to figure out where to take things, pick up items, etc. I think if we could build our farm as we went, it would be easier, but as it is now, it's very easy to get lost amongst areas that exist but that we don't own yet.

												Alright... So, Farming simulator 2015 is a farming game (No surprise there) Where you can: Harvest crops, Raise cows and other farming stuff. Its fairly fun... At least, when it works. The DLC is abundant and extremely overpriced. You may get a couple of vehicles or a couple of attachments. And to be honest the amount you get from each pack is surprisingly low... I would happily pay 75% of retail price for it but for its full price I think its just a money grab.The multiplayer is utterly terrible. If you have a poor connection it is nearly impossible to steer properly. The client often freezes while moving and will reset your velocity which is very frustrating. And as previously stated makes steering and maneuvering difficult. Loading is extremely annoying. When connecting its really  luck based. Sometimes it may connect but usually it doesn't. And when you actually manage to connect it takes forever to load and once you finish loading you end up with this weird player sync thing that takes ages and the entire server freezes the entire time during this process.Physics in this game are nearly non existent. When getting out of vehicles you can glitch through walls. Grabbing logs and bales is difficult. Getting bales on and off bale forks can be glichy and difficult. Tools often glitch through the ground when attaching to them and it can be difficult to get them out of the ground. Wheel friction is a little funny and you rarely have proper traction. As for content I feel this game is lacking without overpriced dlc. There are only two maps and only a couple of vehicle brands. And I feel like certain categories such as road tractors and lowboys are extremely lacking. The maps seem small and the layouts are confusing. It is also difficult to get up the hills with large loads because of the wheel friction. The ai on the roads is just frustrating and isn't programmed well. I have had cars turn into me at an intersection many times.The modding community is riddled with unfinished, broken, and stolen mods. However there are also many well made and good mods. Another problem that I have found is that mods in multiplayer are extremely annoying. You have to find every mod that is on the server before you can join which can be a tedious and slow process. Other than that mods can add allot of what the dlc does to the game and add alot more variety. So, In conclusion I bought this game during the christmas sales and I have enjoyed it to an extent. Do I think it is worth the money? No, I personally don't believe that at full retail price this game is worth the cost given all of its problems. Would I buy it on sale? Possibly but now that I have seen its problems I am not so sure.As for fs 2017? I feel that if I don't see alot of improvement in the netcode and physics I don't plan on purchasing it.TL: DR Buy something elseAlso for those complaining about me having poor specs and how that affects my game... My computer is running a q8400 @2.66 ghz, Gtx 750ti (Manualy overclocked) and 8 gigs of ddr3 ram. Yes, It isn't the best computer but it runs fs at max settings with no lag.			"

												""PARTIAL controller support"" should read ""MINIMAL controller support""This is one of many, many things completely wrong and dated about this game. The developers are obviously very old school and very uneducated amateurs. Probably bottom of the barrel hires that were cheap or can't really do good enough work to work for a AAA company.In other words, the game is ""shoddy"". It's ""clunky"".Things that SUCK1) The menu and hud are about as amateur as you can get. Game's menu looks like it was deisgned in Frontpage '982) The CONTROLS! < - 1,000x3) The lack of Workshop supportYou need #3 to make #1-2 acceptable, so there isn't an ""easy"" way to bring this game up to current gaming standards.This game would be perfect for people who aren't really gamers and don't know the difference between a good game and a bad one. If you're the kind of person who NEVER plays big title games (ergo, you're don't fit in with NORMAL gamers), this game is probably going to suit you just fine.But, if you have a few hundred titles in your collection and you KNOW how games SHOULD be done.. you're going to hate this game with a passion.

No seriously, the America map is virtually identical to the one we had in 2013 with better graphics and a few more things thrown in.  This game could have been an expansion pack/patch instead of a whole new game.  What the heck?Oh, and the forestry aspect of this game kinda sucks.  You can't just run around cutting down whatever tree you want, even if it's a tree on your own property.  Apparently in this game there is a difference between a ""prop"" tree and a ""crop"" tree.  You can't cut down the former, so don't go buying lumber stuff right at the start of your game thinking it's easy money.  You'll be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												The major problem, honestly, is that when you tell a worker to work a field, it's done instantly, removing any impetus for having faster equipment or trying to make a more efficient farm...They've basically removed any of the challenge or work at building a better farm. That and the logging stuff is really annoying to use.That makes the order of play thus:1.) Fast forward time2.) Harvest instantly3.) Buy a few new tractors3a.) Do some cookies and flip them over4.) Uninstally.			"

												I loved this game a lot,but now that I got my new windows 10 I can't play it,I made it to 93 hours in almost 1 month,but now the windows 10 upgrade came out decided to try it,installed steam,installed FS 15,but it crashed,because of stupid steam,even the disc version of fs 15 worked on 10,why not the steam version,if I can't play the steam version,I can't play with my steam friends,if steam doesn't support this,I may delete this acount and report them for this,people that have windows 10 better check everysingle game on steam you install and make sure it supports windows 10.that makes me miss playing with my best friends.

												Absolutely beautiful update to the FS series, I have yet to fully explore the map, but it looks good.  While the physics still have that derpy character that all the FS games have, they are much more realistic, making the game more believable without taking away from the fun of playing Farming Simulator.  My biggest complaint is that there are some crane controls missing from the keymap menu.  This is extremely frustrating as with the default controls, you cannot operate all four axes of the crane simultaneously.  I hope this is fixed soon, might go back to 2013 with Forestmod for a little bit and wait for a patch.8.7/10, controls broken but otherwise excellent, would buy again.			"

												I wanted to live my life as a simple dirt farmer; instead my brothers roped me into being a tractor driving tree rammer. I made my family's fortune cutting down trees and ramming them into a lake to receive magic money from the lake under my pillow at night. All in all, we spent that hard earned magic money on to buy farm things we never used. I'd say it was worth it.			"

The mods are free and you just click install and they do it. NO UNZIPPING NEEDED! This game has many in game features and does not require you to buy any add ons to do certan things. Definately worth buying. If you want to seemore of my Farming Sim reviews, go check the other DLC packs.			"

												In this action pack filled game you enter the shoes of a Wetback gardner that decided to wrack up as much debt as possible after hopping the border and went to college so that THEY could be the one to own all the gardens.Unless you live in some kinda backass country, like Sweeden or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ your name is Pedro. Pedro also happens to belong to the grossly incompetent bros of yours that also happen to dabble in border hopping and need a little extra scratch on the side while they have their 8th child or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anway the game's story plays out like any good story driven game these days. Which means that the plot will branch out depending on how many bros you help, which kind you help, which girl you romance, and what kinda farm you make. Dialogue is your standard three choices of saying the same thing three different ways.Rarely a fourth option will appear to call whomever you're talking to a gringo and your character will start ranting in Spanish causing any mother in earshot to lock her car doors.In the Middle Easterner DLC you can have nearly infinite wives and can even start your own bomb making factory in your garage that you'll 'look the other way' if any questions should arrise.The game does fall short in the Oregon DLC where you can take over a Wildlife Refuge building as nothing really happens for a while. Then it breaks out into a one man Payday style game where you get shot before drawing your gun like the tard you are.12/10, I'll see you in hell Pedro.			"

Gives you a general idea of all the farming equipment. Once you do a career this game is crap. You have no direction on what to do. You dont talk to anyone. You're running around trying to figure out what the hell to do...Just harvested all this wheat and put it in the silos or whatever and nothing happens. I never wanted a refund so badly.			"

												Great premise with a lot of promise.  Unfortunatley, it isn't really a simulator so much as Just Another Game for the ADHD crowd.  The crops grow so fast you can't even finish sowing a field before the crops start growing.   Seriously, I'm seeing sprouts five minutes after I've planted them, two rows away from where I'm sowing.  And that's on the damned SLOW growth speed.  I know GM produce is pretty fast-growing, but that's just effing ridiculous.  Crops ready to harvet -- again on SLOW setting -- in two game days.  Default cruise speeds on the tractors that would do nothing more than tear up dirt in real life.  Sowing a field at 26 mph in real life would yield nothing more than a barren field and torn up equipment.I'd love to see a real farming simulator.  Sadly, this isn't it.			"

Gives you a general idea of all the farming equipment. Once you do a career this game is crap. You have no direction on what to do. You dont talk to anyone. You're running around trying to figure out what the hell to do...Just harvested all this wheat and put it in the silos or whatever and nothing happens. I never wanted a refund so badly.			"

												In this action pack filled game you enter the shoes of a Wetback gardner that decided to wrack up as much debt as possible after hopping the border and went to college so that THEY could be the one to own all the gardens.Unless you live in some kinda backass country, like Sweeden or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ your name is Pedro. Pedro also happens to belong to the grossly incompetent bros of yours that also happen to dabble in border hopping and need a little extra scratch on the side while they have their 8th child or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anway the game's story plays out like any good story driven game these days. Which means that the plot will branch out depending on how many bros you help, which kind you help, which girl you romance, and what kinda farm you make. Dialogue is your standard three choices of saying the same thing three different ways.Rarely a fourth option will appear to call whomever you're talking to a gringo and your character will start ranting in Spanish causing any mother in earshot to lock her car doors.In the Middle Easterner DLC you can have nearly infinite wives and can even start your own bomb making factory in your garage that you'll 'look the other way' if any questions should arrise.The game does fall short in the Oregon DLC where you can take over a Wildlife Refuge building as nothing really happens for a while. Then it breaks out into a one man Payday style game where you get shot before drawing your gun like the tard you are.12/10, I'll see you in hell Pedro.			"

												Ok, for one, if you dont like the game, then dont play it.So, after playing the game for a few hours or less(cant really say anymore lol), it is ADDICTING. So what are some Pros? Good question i will tell you:1. The Graphics are SUPERB. the best of any farming sim game to this date, and i have been playing the franchise since 2009(then on a crappy laptop). The Graphics max out on my 770 perfectly, so i get absolutely no stutters.2. The speedometer's actually work! Yes they do work, that was the first time i have seen it and i LOVE it. i can finally drive inside and fell like im driving a car, not a metal box with crappy picture version speedometers.3. You actually have a TON of different tools at your disposal so that is much said over 2013 as they had few tractors.4. You actually have turn signals. You can just cruise around and use your turn signals if you so choose.Some cons?1. The game could have WAY more tractors and stuff. I feel they left a lot to be disired by not adding many tractors and combines from like John Deere and other U.S. Manufacturers.2. You could do LED lightbars instead of rotating beacons. Huge downside that still lacks as this game is AWESOME. You should make it a option for money that you can add it to your vehicle.3. A lot of the reviews are a little misleading as they say the tire tracks are much bigger then they really are. They are pretty small, but to be honest i dont care as long as i can see themIf you were like me and sat there FOREVER wondering if you should spend the money, then do it. IT IS WORTH IT! Best game of the year and it should get a award as in my opinion the game has got a whole overhaul that did the game great.			"

Buy the 2013 version, it works great and is almost the same game without the woodcutting part.			"

												I'm sitting here in my old Massey 698, taking my trailer full of barley backward and forward to the yard. It should be the most boring game in the world. The hours I have spent following rows of straw pulling the tedder. Or Running the first few widths of headland so that the non-too-bright hired worker doesn't run the combine through a hedge. I should be smashing my face against the keyboard to relieve the tedium.But FS2015 draws you in with it's strangely relaxing gameplay. The daily running of your farm machinery, of which there is a vast array to choose from (when you have earned the money to buy it) is every bit as involving as levelling your character in other more visceral games. The minutiae of farm management will become an obsession, such as the ratio of chaff/hay to use for the best silage mix, or whether to take that load of canola (which is oilseed♥♥♥♥♥♥to those in my neck of the woods) straight to the market for sale or keep it in storage until the demand goes up.I have essentially spent 100+ hours driving a tractor around fields at approximately 14mph, yet I have been utterly immersed and enthralled for the entire time - and only just now is my farm turning a profit enough so I can start to invest in some real meaty machinery (£400k for a new harvester anyone..?)Which brings me to a very important aspect of this game; the modding community, which is thriving and huge. On top of the two standard maps (and an extra one with the expansion), there are a bunch of fantastic farms to download and play. Two to make a note of if you do end up buying this: Chellington and Coldborough - both of which evoke the beautifully quaint English countryside that was such a big part of my own rural youth. On top of this there are literally hundreds of tractors and associated implements to download. FS2015 often seems like one massive advert for New Holland, but machinery from brands that didn't make it to the offical game, like Massey Ferguson, John Deere and Ford, have been lovingly modelled and programmed by talented folks in the community, plus a load of useful little add-ons like the ability to tell one tractor to follow another - which doesn't seem like much but is actually worth it's weight in gold when you can have a baler tag behind you as you windrow a field of straw. Baling to be fair is one of the more laborious activities..! In summary, as much as any other game I can think of, the modding community make this game the great experience it is.Over the years I've heard people talk about this series of games many times and thought it would never be the game for me, after all there is no story as such, no guns, no real quests or missions and no endgame to speak of, other than earning enough money to get your hands on the more exciting heavy machinery. I only bought FS2015 on a whim because it was on sale and I am so glad I did. So if you are on the fence about this and are looking for a complete change from the usual procession of samey shooters and rpg's, give it a try...Get this game..! And GET ORF MY LAND..!			"

												This game was a major dissapointment. I use to play this game on my iphone and loved it. But on the computer, the graphics are really bad, dont get thrown off by their trailers graphics because you will be very dissapointed. Another problem i had with this game is that the tutorial is really bad. Even with my past experiences in the iphone world i was unnable to figure out how to drive a tractor. If you are really thinking of trying this game out try it in the apple or android store first, its a lot more fun and the graphics are 10 times better on the iphone. Please dont be thrown off by the trailers ""amazing"" graphics because you will not be happy on your first launch.			"

												This game is sort of fun for a little while, then everything becomes repetition and quickly gets boring, i dont know why but i bought this game twice costing £30 on steam and wait for it ....... £50 on the PS4 ....... in my eyes this game is worth about £15-20 and thats when you realy have nothing else going on in your life and you become so bored you buy this game.......i leave this as a thumbs down review for the pure robbery this company has done to its buyers and the price they sold this for in the past and now (including PS4), all those niave kids and pure loners with nothing else to do in life will whip this game up and im sure they will have a good time for a limited time, then if smart enough reach the realisation they paid too much for the game and start to question themselves if theve been trolled by this company ?the ones that wernt smart enough pre-ordered the copy and paste job of farming simulator 16			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												I own this game for my console, but with the many who use it via Steam (by way of youtube videos) I became very interested. So, I purchased it twice and yet is customer service available via phone support.  My idea of customer service is not having to search through many unrelated and somewhat reated issues to resolve my problem.   I could go on and on but I will stop here.  Love the game on my console but getting it loaded via Steam and my computer not so much a fan.			"

												Claudius. And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this confusion, Grating so harshly all his days of quiet 1685With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?Rosencrantz. He does confess he feels himself distracted, But from what cause he will by no means speak.Guildenstern. Nor do we find him forward to be sounded, But with a crafty madness keeps aloof 1690When we would bring him on to some confession Of his true state.Gertrude. Did he receive you well?Rosencrantz. Most like a gentleman.Guildenstern. But with much forcing of his disposition. 1695Rosencrantz. ♥♥♥♥♥rd of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply.Gertrude. Did you assay him To any pastime?Rosencrantz. Madam, it so fell out that certain players 1700We o'erraught on the way. Of these we told him, And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him. 1705Polonius. 'Tis most true; And he beseech'd me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.Claudius. With all my heart, and it doth much content me To hear him so inclin'd. 1710Good gentlemen, give him a further edge And drive his purpose on to these delights.Rosencrantz. We shall, my lord.Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.Claudius. Sweet Gertrude, leave us too; 1715For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may here Affront Ophelia. Her father and myself (lawful espials) Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing unseen, 1720We may of their encounter frankly judge And gather by him, as he is behav'd, If't be th' affliction of his love, or no, That thus he suffers for.Gertrude. I shall obey you; 1725And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish That your good beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlet's wildness. So shall I hope your virtues Will bring him to his wonted way again, To both your honours. 1730Ophelia. Madam, I wish it may.[Exit Queen.]Polonius. Ophelia, walk you here.- Gracious, so please you, We will bestow ourselves.- [To Ophelia] Read on this book, That show of such an exercise may colour 1735Your loneliness.- We are oft to blame in this, 'Tis too much prov'd, that with devotion's visage And pious action we do sugar o'er The Devil himself.Claudius. [aside] O, 'tis too true! 1740How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience! The harlot's cheek, beautied with plast'ring art, Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it Than is my deed to my most painted word. O heavy burthen! 1745Polonius. I hear him coming. Let's withdraw, my lord.Exeunt King and Polonius].Enter Hamlet.Hamlet. To be, or not to be- that is the question: Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 1750The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- No more; and by a sleep to say we end The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 1755That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation Devoutly to be wish'd. To die- to sleep. To sleep- perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub! For in that sleep of death what dreams may come When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 1760Must give us pause. There's the respect That makes calamity of so long life. For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay, 1765The insolence of office, and the spurns That patient merit of th' unworthy takes, When he himself might his quietus make With a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear, To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 1770But that the dread of something after death- The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn No traveller returns- puzzles the will, And makes us rather bear those ills we have Than fly to others that we know not of? 1775Thus conscience does make cowards of us all, And thus the native hue of resolution Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought, And enterprises of great pith and moment With this regard their currents turn awry 1780And lose the name of action.- Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!- Nymph, in thy orisons Be all my sins rememb'red.Ophelia. Good my lord, How does your honour for this many a day? 1785Hamlet. I humbly thank you; well, well, well.Ophelia. My lord, I have remembrances of yours That I have longed long to re-deliver. I pray you, now receive them.Hamlet. No, not I! 1790I never gave you aught.Ophelia. My honour'd lord, you know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd As made the things more rich. Their perfume lost, Take these again; for to the noble mind 1795Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind. There, my lord.Hamlet. Ha, ha! Are you honest?Ophelia. My lord?Hamlet. Are you fair? 1800Ophelia. What means your lordship?Hamlet. That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse to your beauty.Ophelia. Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?Hamlet. Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform 1805honesty from what it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty into his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives it proof. I did love you once.Ophelia. Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.Hamlet. You should not have believ'd me; for virtue cannot so 1810inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.Ophelia. I was the more deceived.Hamlet. Get thee to a nunnery! Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse 1815me of such things that it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud, revengeful, ambitious; with more offences at my beck than I have thoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act them in. What should such fellows as I do, crawling between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves all; 1820believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery. Where's your father?Ophelia. At home, my lord.Hamlet. Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but in's own house. Farewell. 1825Ophelia. O, help him, you sweet heavens!Hamlet. If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a nunnery. Go, farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough what 1830monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.Ophelia. O heavenly powers, restore him!Hamlet. I have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one face, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you 1835amble, and you lisp; you nickname God's creatures and make your wantonness your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't! it hath made me mad. I say, we will have no moe marriages. Those that are married already- all but one- shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go. Exit. 1840Ophelia. O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown! The courtier's, scholar's, soldier's, eye, tongue, sword, Th' expectancy and rose of the fair state, The glass of fashion and the mould of form, Th' observ'd of all observers- quite, quite down! 1845And I, of ladies most deject and wretched, That suck'd the honey of his music vows, Now see that noble and most sovereign reason, Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh; That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth 1850Blasted with ecstasy. O, woe is me T' have seen what I have seen, see what I see!Enter King and Polonius.Claudius. Love? his affections do not that way tend; Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little, 1855Was not like madness. There's something in his soul O'er which his melancholy sits on brood; And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose Will be some danger; which for to prevent, I have in quick determination 1860Th			"

												do not buy this game its a good game but go out and get it on disk as after about a month and you then decide to get mods and maps year its good for a bit and then if it stops working you are done with that game as steam support is terible and i had to get a refund and i dont even know if it worked yet because i have a new card and have not yet set up my online banking and would just like to say that if you pc is not the strongest dont even look into getting ark survival becuase i also got that game and i got all exsited because the youtubers play it and i got into the bit were you decide to join an online ark or privet i would then load it and then it would crash and i would also like a refund on that			"

												 Not impressed...why? because this is simply a rehash of 2013. They payed no attention to what the community did with 2013 to make it a great game and simply rereleased essentially the same game with new a new map. same old seed types, same old layout..nothing new!As for the claims of better graphics and working physics...where???  what are you guys seeing that I'm not, 2013 community made maps that look better than this and the new grass people hype on about looks worse than the old grass. They had a chance to produce a great follow up game and they blew it....we can only hope the community can make it better!I enjoyed 2013 a lot, even more with community added mods,so was really looking forward to this sequel expecting great things but unfortunately its a dissapointment.

												I made a horrible mistake buying this.  I thought this was something akin to SimFarm, however it is rather mind-numbing as you have to go through driving the tractor around yourself (you can hire workers to mitigate some of the most menial tasks).  Controls leave something to be desired.  You have to buy each individual animal in the store - there is no quantity select.I believe that this is the first time I've paid for a game that I will not be investing any more time than the 1 hour I've spent.

												Why pay the money for this.....it's the same game as 2013 ....Pro's                            # graphics are a bit better# the physics engine seems better# main map is ok# nicely laid out map# improved UICon's# roads are now where near as good as 2013# cannot get some vehicles up hills seem to catch on bumps in roads# UI a bit hard to navigate# roads seem to have too many sharp bends on them making it hard to drive around# when ploughing a field then cultivate it, the lines stay in the same direction no matter which way you cultivate itSummaryReally the same game as 2013 when you compare the both, no really thought has been put into the game, as mentioned above graphics and physics are better but when you cultivate a field from North to South the lines are straight, but when you do the same for East to West the lines don't change with the so called effort that they say went into this game you would have thought they would have got that right if they did would be a bit more realalistic....Overall once again the mod community may well get on board and complete the game to where it should be...Maybe the money paid for the game should be going to the mod community because the $29.00 in my opinion is a complete waste and a huge let down.

												FS15 is a disappointing iteration of FS 2013.There's nothing really new apart from a bit of logging, and considering the number of mods available for FS 2013 after 2 years, FS15 is currently a step backwards in almost every sense apart from some slightly prettier graphics.It seems to me the developers spent their development time on things such as making the trailers fill up asymetrically and coding a system to allow any tree in the game to be cut up into pieces (no small feat I'd imagine) little things like having some more robust hired worker AI (i'd like them to avoid trees, not smash into them) and some options for automation of a tasks such as delivering/selling harvested stuff seems to have been totally ignored in favor of a new skybox.the physics are essentially the same, with the occasional MEF (Mechanical Epileptic Fit) setting your vehicles dancing when you bump into the wrong thing, the AI cars are more solid than most tanks, and despite the people and cars moving around, the maps are dead.the washing of the tractors with the cleaner is lame at best, just point the washer at the tractors wheel for 2 mins and all the dirt will dissappear, no matter where on the tractor it is.the logging allows you to make cheat levels of cash in a very short time, plant a tree nearthe mill pond, cut it down with a $1000 chainsaw and push it into the pond with a tractor for an instant payoff. existing trees on the map fetch about 25k in normal and planted Firs can get about 45k.the game has it's appeal, but is at best disappointing.having said all that, I'm still playing it and will continue to do so in the hope that some mods will fix up the gripes i have. If you like fs2013, you'll like FS15, If you liked fs2013 with mods, wait a few months and you'll like FS15.			"

												I was looking forward to the release of this however upon downloading it there still wasn't any native compatibility with the Logitech G27 Steering wheel, tractors still have the same old cheap physics, vehicles are still all automatic and the game still thinks that I have a gamepad/wheel from the late 90's. Upon changing a few axis commands for the use of pedals I deleted a key binding that stops the game from working...... Really? So here I am upon release re installing a game with no real groundbreaking feature advancements that became unplayable by deleting a key binding. GG Giants! It could have been a decent simulator if they would have bothered adding gears to tractors and real wheel compatibility with force feedback like in EuroTruck Simulator 2 or Assetto Corsa (both of which supported wheels properly from day 1) as at the end of the day the main part of the game is driving.

												This game FS15 is the same as FS13 (with mods that are out there). There is nothing new and I mean literally  NOTHING new because every thing ""new"" is all ready a mod for FS13 that you can get free. With FS15 what I would of like to see is-Improve the AI-new animals like a dog/cat to roam around the farm, horses, goats, ect..-a more advanced economy-better driving feel like shifting gears i.e forword, low/high gear, reverse, ect..-a start from scratch no inheriting a already well established farm like ([+]Captain Crunch) pointed out -more modern equipment-more maps from different countries -more types of seeds-seasons i.e. summer, fall, winter, spring (depending on the map/country)-more selection/equipment for woodcutting -more and better  placeable objects (not just limited to certain spots)-a way to look at the controls without need to quit the game to the main menu -include a modding program (it would be cool)-have the radios in the tractors work and allow us to have our own musicbut all said and done if you have FS13 keep it and play that because FS15 isn't new just a polished FS13 with mods.

												This game just got worse then before. The so called new physics engine seems lacking at best. Workers cant be managed as easy as before, you now have to drive them to the field you want them to do any work, and they can easily get stuck etc. Woodworking / Forestry requires a lot of investments, which means you are basically stuck with the default gear for a long time. You basically need a powerwasher, as a windshiledwiper seems to be lacking. And washing something down requires no skill whatsoever.

												Single Player - YesMultyplayer - NoAt the moment I can not recommend this game until they fix the Multyplayer issues. The chopping down of trees makes it unplayable for other players at the moment with the amount of lag it causes having branches all over the map. Wait for a patch before you think about buying this game, may change my review based on the patch.			"

												IF you are into fast action paced games,   this is so not the game you want to get (no matter how many times your friends wave a cow in front of you)... It's very difficult to figure out,   I had no goals to work from,  no idea where I was meant to go,   what machine I needed,  where the vehicle store was.  which field belonged to me....... I was so bored within 6 minutes of the game starting,   that I actually turned it off and played something else.   Be aware that this game is now at 50% off now in the steam store....      That in itself tells you that STEAM no longer thinks they are going to get the original price of this title anymore and have lost confidence in it,    and had to reduce it,  just to move the units out the door. My advice is to watch ALOT of YouTube videos of the game play of this title. ... make sure you are happy to waste your money on this....			"

They claim there are new graaphics and Physics Engines, well there isnt anything new other then the Logging witch is where most people will spend there time as I am. Mods will have to save the game at this point. If you dont mind paying for just the logging then you will have a great game to play.			"

												I was very dissappointed and I was not expecting a lot.  The graphics seem image based, not rendered.  ie when you plow a field it will only plow in perftct streight or diagonal lines.  If you try a figure 8 or somethign it will render in very large blocks of streight or diagonal rows.  I wanted to play with the timber machines and have not found a way to access them.This is a horrid game.  Perhaps the fiancial game behind it is better than driving the machines.. Real dissappointment.  I wish I could ask for a refund "

												I've lived most of my life in farm country and never had a clue why farmers needed 4 different tractors and what all those weird looking trailers with the big blades and springs and wheels were for, and if nothing else after playing this game now I have a much better understanding of all that.  I mean, mostly this is a game about driving tractors back and forth across fields over and over.  Which sounds kind of boring, but really isn't... it's actually pretty relaxing in the way that mowing a lawn with a lawn tractor is relaxing.  And it's all a nice change of pace from games about slaughtering lots and lots of stuff.  Beyond the driving there are interesting choices to make about a farm run profitably.  Spending so much time sitting in a tractor gives you plenty of time to think about all that.  Plus now I feel like I'm not qualified to pick up women on farmersonly.com, so there's that.			"

												I was a happy farmer and then I noticed I was losing money every 10 or so seconds and learned it was maintinence costs for my machinery. I then sold everything I owned and used the cash to buy a truck and go gold coin hunting. After completion, I sold the truck to buy a tractor with a fork lift and do side missions. Eventually I got a lawn mower which led to a grass harvester which finally led me to sell all of that stuff to become a lumberjack. Several forests later I finally saved up for a windmill, set the time speed to x120, let my money stockpile sky rocket and then bought all the highest quality farming equipment and continued my life as a happy farmer.TL;DRFarming simulator, coin hunting simulator, odd job simulator, lumberjack simulator, farming simulator. It's got all of them!			"

												This is a great game. I've put about 70 hours into it. If you download the game (which I highly recomend) you sould consider mods. Mods will extend your gameplay to the maximum and will make it so that you're flexible to do anything you want. The $32.99 (CDN) price tag isn't all that bad when you get into the game and try it. All in all I highly recomend this game to anyone of all ages. So get on down to the Bjornholm or Westbridge hill and drive tractors now! This review is not a paid review			"

												The first time I saw this game being played, was from a couple friends who ""farm"" everynight on Xbox. At first I thought it would be pretty boring and repetitive to play all the time as I am more of an RPG gamer myself, however it turned out to be quite the opposite. FS15 is an extremely involved game with a wide variety of options available to you. Everything from farming crops, to tending to your animals and mixing feed is avaiable to you to do in the game. On top of managing your farm physically, you have to manage it financially as well. Taking loans from banks, paying for feed and gas for your vehicles as well as daily maintenence costs are all different things that you will have to manage while playing this game. With countless hours of posibilities and different maps to give you a different experience, you will definately get your moneys worth out of FS15. For people who have little to no knowledge of farming (which included myself before this), I would definately recommend going through the tutorials so that everything is a little easier to understand. Unlike most simulators, FS15 is fairly easy to grasp and can entertain you for much longer than a typical simulator game. I would definately reccomend this to others to try for themselves AS LONG as you enjoy simulators. Because overall, it is esentially a simulator and not any sort of game that will keep you up all night, unless you have (or develop) a passion for creating your own farm!			"

												Farming Simulator is a game about farming. That pretty much sums it up. Buy land, Farm land, sell crops, repeat! If you're looking to make inordinate amounts of money there are also ways to do that, but then you run the risk of ruining the game for yourself as there's not much to do after that.			"

												Should have done my homework before buying the Gold addon. Guess i'll have to take the heat on that one. Just moved so I've been out of touch with everything. We can no longer change the draw distance because the DLC is an encrypted file. Are you frigging kidding me. This is 2015 not 2005. We have video cards that can render vegetation allot farther out than 20 ft. At least give the option in game. I can't even play it because it looks so bad compared to having the draw distance cranked way out. Then having to see all the shadow popping on top of it. Who made this decision at GIANT. You have an awesome product, why cripple it with such a short draw distance.			"

Beautiful and interesting.Different levels of difficulty can help people find whatever they want:easily spending few hours relaxing or managing agrocompany in hardmode. Different amount of tools, harvesters and vehicles with high level of details makes this game really exciting.Mod support is awesome - makes game more realistic.Would be great to have animated getting in/out of vehicles, but that's minor. Hope would be included in future games.Thanks for a great game, guys. Can't wait for Farming Simulator 17 for PC. Good luck.			"

												I'll try to keep this short review as informative as possible.(🌟) Pros:🌟 Every action you do is visually satisfying, as a result, FS 15 can get pretty addicting as it is relaxing.🌟 Tutorials cover up a lot of things new players have to learn.🌟 Nighttime is reallistically dark.🌟 You can hire workers to do stuff you can't at the moment.🌟 Lots of awsum downloadable mods out there.🌟 Takes up little space on your hard drive, yet maintains beautiful graphics and smooth framerate.(-) Cons:- Needs more liveliness (Ex. more traffic and more people walking)- Daytime isn't realistically bright.- You and your hired workers look all the same.    My Suggestions:+ Add a pig farm, for pigs to be raised and sold. (Mmm bacon.)+ Allow the player to change his outfit via the PDA. (It seems the protagonist doesn't take a bath)+ Add relaxing BGMs during gameplay. (I hafto play music on the Windows Media Player instead)+ There should be an icon to be able gather all Chicken eggs at once.+ Rain should make your crops grow slightly faster, while hail would slightly slow their growth.Overall:The game is already awesome, and it only takes a few more simple improvements to further immerse the player into the ""Living in the game"".Keep on developing great games!

												Graphics might be nice and fancy and the tree cutting might be something new and appealing, but don't let those trick you into buying the game.- The options menu is pathetic and useless.- Controls are weak (no mouse sensitivity and you litterally have to move your mouse a mile just to turn around)- many features missing to the game to the point of wondering why this game got such high reviews- no roll over help at all- no description for any of the items you can buy (3 chainsaws to choose from, but no description to say what's different about them... basically no logical reason for 3 to exist)- terrible GUI- still no vehicle damage or proper collision detection- physics are terrible as usual (trees are the only thing with good physics implemented)- no reason to earn money aside from greed again- I don't think there's any crop risks either, like insects or fongus or w/e to ruin them...- no flexibility in farming methods- etc, I discovered all this within 1 hour of gameplay.This game isn't better than FS 2013, in fact, I'm not even sure it's better than FS 2011. I personally don't give 2 ♥♥♥♥♥ about quality of graphics, I just want a game that works and is enjoyable and actually feels like a farm simulator to which I could relate to. This game just feels like you have to farm in a linear manner, otherwise it'll take you forever to get anywhere in the game.I went straight to farming trees, since that's the new thing added. I bought a chainsaw, bought several attachments thinking one of them would fit the tractor, but nope... so I just went with a weight on the front so I could push the trees with it (need to move the trees around somehow since the tree based vehicles are crazy expensive). Went to a tree nearest to the pond where the logs go into, figured out how to cut one down, shaved off the branches, spent 1/2 hour pushing it around, trying to get it in the pond, finally got it in there, the branches take even longer. I just said ""to hell with this"" and drove into the pond and quit the game.How hard is it to include an attachment for the tractor so that the tractor could pick up the logs or push them around properly? Or, how about a rope to drag them around?This game feels as much of a simulator as Surgeon Simulator. It cannot be taken seriously.I've probably played most if not all the available farm simulators I could find out there... I still think ""The Farm 2010"" is the most enjoyable farm simulator out there (even though it's also a bit linear and limited). It's not at all similar to this game though. The most similar and far superior game to this one would still be the classic DOS game SimFarm.I would rate this game an average score. It's not great, but it's not terrible either. I do regret spending money on it though.			"

												Whether you know it or not, there is farming (aka grinding) in almost every game anymore. This game is all about that, and takes it to a fun place that can be advanced many times over. Farm for profits, use profits to upgrade, use upgrades to farm more, rinse & repeat. It's a great game and you have to try it to really understand how peacefully fun it is. The reviews and hours played of everyone told me all I needed to know to buy it, and I didn't go wrong.			"

												It, overall, is a very good game. Sometimes it can be boring, and other times pretty exiting (like when you get your money from a harvest).  It is not perfect, but it is really good.Pros:  Amazing graphics  Realistic  It doesn't dump you with no supplies, you acctually have something to start with.Cons:  Workers can be expensive  It takes a while to plant fields yourself  If your not on a lot, your crops dieI really like this game, but depending on your personality, you may or may not like it.

												This is a great game. I've put about 70 hours into it. If you download the game (which I highly recomend) you sould consider mods. Mods will extend your gameplay to the maximum and will make it so that you're flexible to do anything you want. The $32.99 (CDN) price tag isn't all that bad when you get into the game and try it. All in all I highly recomend this game to anyone of all ages. So get on down to the Bjornholm or Westbridge hill and drive tractors now! This review is not a paid review			"

												I do enjoy this game as I've put in roughly 17 hours or so into after 3 days!  I am new to the series with no knowledge of farming or farming games other than Farmville and Hay Day!  The graphics aren't that great.   They look like last gen graphics.  The vehicles themselves looks good but the plants and trees look very low rez.  I guess my biggest complaint about the game is the lack of direction.  They only have a few basic tutorails which you will forget 10 minutes after you fininished because you only have enough money at the start to do wheat fields over and over.  Why does the map not have a legend?  Why can't you place waypoints?  The game has quests(sort of) but I think rather than place x would like xyz they'd do better by giving you actual goals.  Like make x amount of $.  Or buy x machine and y header to do z activity.  They could then give you the tutorial once you've acquired the pieces and you can run off and do the task.  Also, it seems this developer is European so it kinda makes sense but...no John Deere equipment?????  Yet you have U.S. farm!!! O.oI'd also like to be to plant things like strawberries or grapes...their expansions don't add any other crop types just bigger machines(again no John Deere).  I really do like the game but at the same time see the potential for greatness where right now it's just good.  7.5 here lets hope in 2017 they'll have read my review and implimented my (and other peoples gripes) into the new game.  Farm on!			"

												This is an extraordinary game, probably the most absorbing I have ever played. At heart it's a campaign game where you are building an agro business, deciding which new equipment to invest in, and the most efficient way of doing things. Of course you get to mess about with loads of cool tractors and stuff on the way!You'll need to invest in a gamepad, it's very frustrating with just the keyboard, and the only DLC that's useful in my opinion is the JCB addon. Mostly just for the forktruck.I know precious little about real farming, however speaking from a purely gameplay perspective I've only found two serious faults with the game - both of which can easily be fixed.1) The vehicle steering is way too sensitive, even with a gamepad it feels nowhere near right.2) The price you get for selling silage is at least twice what it should be, and this seriously unbalances the game. Producing silage requires only a modest capital investment, and compared to wheat, barley, etc. needs relatively little effort on the part of the player.Bizarrely, you can make ten times as much money turning a field of corn into silage, as you can harvesting the grain !!In summary then, an excellent, unique game which is well worth a try - don't be put off by its slightly nerdy image :-) "

Somehow plowing a field and then planting crops, waiting for them to grow, harvesting them, and then selling them is fun. I don't know how but it is. Ever since this game I have really opened my eyes to the different types of games out there. I not longer judge a game until I have played it and I found out that I really like a wide variety of games. This one is fun with a friend or alone. Totally reccomend it.			"

												What can be said about Farming Simulator 2015 that hasn’t already been said?  Oh yeah.. it ♥♥♥♥ing sucks! A pleasant gaming experience… until you start getting into some of the more complicated parts of the game - like FARMING. PLAGUED with frustratingly stupid AI that will consistently get stuck on every tree and house in the game(even a Roomba has better collision detection than the AI in this game). When was the last time you seen a HOUSE 2 meters from a giant wheat field anyway? Riddled with bugs at every turn (I have crashed several times during gameplay). Just trying to use the chipper in this game will drive you insane! Which brings me to Forestry. The newest addition to the game… however gawk amazingly as you find that you can’t harvest any trees you want…. no no no.. that’s too easy.. instead gaze upon the almighty “This tree type is not supported” informative text as you wonder what you are going to do with the tree you just cut down with your chainsaw to free the AI that was stuck on it.  Oh yeah... you could cut it up and throw it in the chipper… but do so at the cost of your sanity and about 2 hours... per quarter... and after unfliping your chipper for the 10th time. The freaking ""new and improved"" phsyics system in this game is just horrible. Multiplayer can be laggy as hell. Rubberbanding, warping, and stuttering are a common occurrence. And speaking of multiplayer… Want to open up a small local LAN based dedicated server? No problem! Just run that dedicated server file (conveniently included with your game in your main game folder) do a little xml setup, run the exe… and just play play play… well after you find out your server is rejecting your connection and you must buy a separate KEY for $15 Come on! Really? Suck it Giants Software. The tutorials and descriptive texts are almost completely useless as many of them assume that you KNOW what the equipment does already. I am not a ♥♥♥♥ing farmer, and frankly I don't think farmers would want to play a farming simulator game.. So why in the hell would the game programmers assume I would know what the hell a ""TL 436-7"" does or even what it is?  But I will surely know that this POS Y2K-13 MARK 12 will fit on it. If I had to look up this much information on the net, the least the programmers could have done is include a built in web browser. I could go on, but to sum it all up in a nice neat little bow. It’s a $30 game that has made millions… and STILL plays like a steaming pile of $5♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												This is a great game to play by yourself, even though you can play with others.  When playing with others, its generally a rule that if you're on their farm, you obey their orders, and vice versa.  FS15 doesn't have a lot of action and is meant for people with a lot of patience.  However, if you're bored and don't feel like playing something that gives you adrenaline, then this is great.  It takes a lot of time to make a good farm and get all the machines and tools you need to do everything, but it feels rewarding once you do.  I get bored of playing after a while, but I eventually come back, and start a new farm, and/or download a new map.  There are tons of mods you can download off the internet to make the game more exciting and/or easier.I usually like playing this game when I feel like I want a break from RPGs and shooter games.... especially when I'm raging! :)  It's a pretty calming game to play.

												Farming SImulator 2015 is an odd game, if you can call it a game at all.  As a child I was absolutely obsessed with anything that made a big noise, had wheels and...well was big, and did stuff.  Farming Simulator 15 taps into all of that giving you a sandbox of farming toys to play around with.  What you do with the tools at your disposal, is entirely up to you and I think thats what many mainstream publications fail to understand, hence the low critic reviews.  Farming Simulator 2015 isn't really a game, it's a silicon toybox of farming machinery and should be treated as such.  It really is like emptying your toybox on the floor and making a game of what is in front of you....I love it!			"

												I'm a city boy who doesn't know how to manage a flower pot, let alone a farm.  So I can't say how accurate this game is as a simulator.But I'm pretty sure the only significant flaw to this game is it's too much fun.  If running a farm was this much fun, they wouldn't pay people to do it.  I'm finally starting to burn out on the game, just a bit, and as of this writing I have close to 200 hours on record.  My meter is a dollar an hour.  If I play more than I spent, I got my money's worth.  Think I bought this for $40, so I cleaned up on Farming Simulator 2015.Of course I never did play around with forestry or sheep shearing... I guess my work is not done!			"

												This looks like a really fun game but unfortunately I could not play it.  If you are going to use a keyboard, or maybe a gamepad this is is playable.  I have a wheel and pedals and wrongly assumed they would work.  I spend considerable time trying to set this up for a wheel and found through a lot of research FS15 doesn't like a lot of wheels including G27s.  If it works fine, if not tough luck.  Customer support was no help.The control mapping is a nightmare setup and the concession to controllers is a gamepad column. You can not remap the steering left/right axis which defaults to axis 1.  Fortunately that works for most cases.  When I mapped some buttons/axis I would get multiple axes such as somefunction has axis 4+5.   This is very definitely oriented toward using a keyboard since there is no way for a controller to tell it that you want to go into reverse or forward.  However, I own a wheel and really want to use it so for me this is a no go and I'd get a refund if I could.  Other controls are the same and assume a keyboard.  In many cases when you map a control such as steer forward the opposite, steer backward gets mapped to the same control!Gamepads may work, but I don't have one to try. "

												My best friend got me into this game. At first I was like I don’t care for that game but I was a little interested in the game because of its good reviews and how big the game apparently is. After getting this game and playing a good while, I am very pleased with this purchase. There is so much to do and oh having a friend to help is always a huge plus in this game! This game is one of those that if played without cheating, it is practically unbeatable. The graphics and gameplay are good. There is no story so you can do what you wish. It is a very time consuming strategic game. I really recommend this game!			"

												Farming Simulator is a game about farming. That pretty much sums it up. Buy land, Farm land, sell crops, repeat! If you're looking to make inordinate amounts of money there are also ways to do that, but then you run the risk of ruining the game for yourself as there's not much to do after that.			"

												Oddly addictive simulator. I had a simulator itch and grabbed this at 50% off. The itch has mutated into a fever with over 250 hours play time since March 26. This game is good as-is, played more than 170 hours playing without mods and since then adding mods just makes the game better.You learn about farming techniques and processes for many different sectors from crops to animal husbandry to forestry. All aspects of the game are fun in their own way. But this is a boring game, seriously boring, you drive farm vehicles harvesting your crop and taking care of your animals. There is no goal, deadlines, levels, or in-game achievements to motivate you to complete things. Yet I find myself engorged for hours on end doing the same thing over and over.Mod community is big, there are many sites out there and incredibly detailed modders creating additions to this game. When I feel like I am getting tired and don't want to play, a new mod hooks me back in. The challenge in managing your finances and planning your next big purchase makes this a real life simulator.Multiplayer is okay, I've played a few times and it's very laggy. Other players kind of skip around when connecting to slow hosts on the international server. But you yourself run just fine and it's a good way to play with new equipment before deciding to get it for yourself.If you like simulators, as close to real life as you can get simulators, this is worth every penny. The modding community is large to keep this game fresh with every new mod you add.			"

												A great game, its got all the HD graphics even works really good with a i3 4GB ram computer! (mods can get slow if there is lots like over 8 mods give or take) it has a focus end goal and the time frame is great because you can switch between 5X faster or to normal time (60 second per minute) ITRunner DLC would be okay if you dont really agree with mods but is really not worth is 10:00 USD with is more in dollars really it would be worth about to be generous 4:00 USD its needs a whole lot more things in there and needs a new name. 5.5/10JBC DLC is great compared to the ITRunner but need more content like a new logger that logs the trees, cuts them to size and then puts them into a transporter and this should be worth about 380,000 game credits and comes with custom colors. and a couple more bits of machinery and tools would make JBC really worth its money, but at the moment it should be worth about 7:00 USD and gets a score of at least 7.8/10 This game was really fun a definitely keeper and i can not wait till 2016 edition!  :)			"
