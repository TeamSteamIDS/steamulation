												I just installed this sim on Steam. After hours of playing the non-Steam version, here's what I think about the sim. When I heard of this truck racing simulator to come out, I was instantly looking forward to it. ""What, a truck racing simulator that's realistic?"" I bought it on the release and I gave it a go. I was amazed. You do need to set everything up and I do recommend you to set your in-game wheel to 900 degrees first (if you have a wheel at all). But when everything is set up correctly, it's A BLAST!Physics: The trucks have about 1000-1100hp and weight about 5000-6000kg. It depends what trucks you choose from. Some trucks are a little lighter with less hp, others are heavier with more hp. You need to brake early for the corners, because the machines are very heavy for racing machines. Corners have to be taken very slowly. And be careful with the throttle! You do need to steer the trucks with your right foot a bit, create oversteer to get them round. The physics are from the rFactor 1 engine, but they are authentic and realistic, but above all, they're FUN to drive! It's a blast, really.Graphics: The graphics aren't bad at all and they improve with each update. Reiza is doing a very good job with the graphics. The sim looks full of life  and graphics aren't bad, especially when you think this is actually rFactor 1. Tracks: The tracks in FTruck are mostly Brazilian and not very common for people that are not Brazilian. There are about 15 tracks in the sim with their own configurations. Most people know Interlagos though! Reiza is doing a very good job with the tracks, especially Interlagos looks almost identical to it's laser-scanned version in iRacing. Truck slection: The following truck brands are in the sim: MAN, Mercedes, Scania, Iveco, Ford and Volkswagen.The good:-Tracks are very convincing, true to real and all the tracks from the real series are included.-Graphics are well done, even with the older rF1 engine. When someone is off the track you can see dust blowing from the trucks and it's hard to see :)-Truck physics (you can feel the heavyness of the massive machines, but on the straights they are very fast and can outrun a fast road car easily. 240 km/h is possible on some tracks that offer straights that are long enough)-It's challenging! -Multiplayer! It's fun when there are enough people in the server. -Truck damage (debris falling off)The bad:-It's price. Sorry Reiza, you should have asked more for this wonderful simulator :) Haha (not very serious point here, but really, it is worth more)Now let's get to the more serious points.-AI can sometimes push you off the track. The trucks are very big and heavy, so side-by-side can sometimes get rough.-Setting the wheel rotation to 900 degrees is a bit difficult, it should be possible to adjust in-game. (go to your FTruck installation folder, UserData, then go to your player's name, you'll see a Controller.ini file. Click and drag this to your desktop, right click and press 'Edit'. Then search for the degrees of in-game rotation which is 270 by default. Change this to 900, save the file and put it back into your profile folder from where you got it. Done!-Menu and UI are too much rF1 inspired. That's about it! A great price and a very unique racing simulator. This is the only realistic racing sim where you can drive the Brazilian truck racing series. Just go ahead and purchase this one :)			"

												A brilliant racing sim, you can really feel the weight behind the trucks. I thought I wouldn't be that interested in trucks, but I was so wrong. It is amazing, so much fun. I've had it for over a year, before it came to Steam, and have put in a lot of hours. Every sim racing enthusiast should at least try the demo.			"

												Absolutely perfect racing simulator. I spend a lot of hours playing this game. I highly recommend this for tough simracers. High resolution textures, nice shaders, day/night cycle, fantastic AI, feedback. Just everything is perfectly set up out of the box. And Truck racing is not common in racing game so its nice experience to see such a title. Physics is probably the best on the market. Reize studios did pretty impresive job!			"

												Brilliant truck racing sim. You feel like you are really sitting high in the cab, you can feel the weight of the truck under you, and with the sounds of the horns, air brakes, and heavy diesel engine, there's enough going on to make you think you can actually smell the exhaust smoke around you. It's a real challenge to drift these things through the turns, and the AI is as good as any out there. Although my main interest is formula cars or touring cars, I originally bought this sim when first released a couple of years ago, & quite honestly the reason I bought it was simply because it is made by Reiza - they take some beating when it comes to race sims, and this one without doubt provides believable & realistic racing. If you feel put off by the mostly Brazilian list of circuits, then don't be - they are all extremly well made tracks, a good mixture of long and short, fast & twisting, and all of them are enjoyable to race.For anyone who likes editing/modding, there is scope to paint your own trucks, edit the drivers and teams, and more if you know what you're doing.Highly recommended, and great value at the price.

												This is highly recommeded and a great change from racing cars all the time. I purchased this game from Reiza awhile back and decided to re-purchase it on the Steam platform...I know I could have used my original game key but it is not very expensive, so I thought I would support Reiza again.The game runs very smoothly (on my system) in triple screen and looks even better in triple screen 3D running the TriDef Software.I use a G27 and the FFB is very good and with a variety of other controllers (TH8 Shifters -H-Pattern and Sequential, Button Box)...which makes for throughly enjoyable racing and they all map great with a little help from Xpadder.Graphics quality is fantastic for an old gmotor engine and Reiza have done a wonderful job at massaging the extra Visual detail, Physics and Sound quality out of it....again highly recommended			"

												One of the best simracing titles, as the other Reiza title ""Stock Car Extreme"". A must-have for simracers, with its unique truck vehicle dynamics.It is a hardcore piece software for the usual gamer though. It does not have that immersive video-game feeling like Codemaster's F1 series. You just enter a vehicle, put it in a track and practice/race. It is at its best through a serious racing league and online racing (for real, not a ""bumper cars race""). You can find a lot of real race drivers on these leagues.You won't have chance to properly taste it without a good wheel and pedals set.			"

												I've decided to remove this review following  several  rather negative  reviews of the  sister  review to this game (Stock Car Extreme)  I  will rewrite the review when I'm in the mood to play the game sometime in the not too distant future.  I did write it up in tandem with Stock Car Extreme  at an unearthly hour of the morning (around 4am) plus I'd taken an increased dose of morphine, so feel that i'd missed a lot of the game elements.   My initial  feel for the game was colored by the  default key bindings.  At the time (and probably due to  the  increased amount of morphine i'd taken) I'd though  you couldn't  remap the  key bindings.  A couple of community members put me right on that matter.  It's strange how   something can put you in a mood  which then affects the rest of   the things you write about it.  The review I posted  although positive, didn't do justice the the game overall.

												These trucks are very nice and really fast racing can be very hard and very exciting.This game looks similar to the Stock Car Extreme game, same graphics and tracks but truck racing is very different than the SCE cars and it's a unique experience.The worst ""feature"" of Formula Truck and Stock Car Extreme games is that there is almost no multiplayer, there are some locked servers where some racing clans play sometimes and 1 or 2 free servers that are empty. So most gamers must play single player mode vs the AI trucks. The AI cars of both FT and SCE games are good, but not almost perfect, like the Race07 game, they can't behave well in many sudden and unexpected situations.Overall it's a good (and unique) game, i wish the AI was better and there were free multiplayer servers with many players.

												This is a fantastic racing simulator, unlike so many others due to the uniqueness of controlling such a large, heavy truck. The realism factor is incredibly high. If you're like I was and only accustomed to driving other sims with fast cars with good brakes, get ready for a thrilling learning curve here. These big rigs are heavy in the front, light in the rear, with gobs of power in between. To quote the great James May, ""Does understeer, this lorry."" The sound is incredibly realistic, the graphics look really good, and racing the great AI is thrilling enough to work up a sweat. Damn fine fun, this is. How I wish I had discovered this gem sooner than I did. Made by the same great developers (Reiza) that created the awesome ""Stock Car Extreme"", the quality of this sim is top shelf work. If you enjoy a realistic driving game/sim, do NOT miss this. PS: For those unfamiliar with the real world version of Formula Truck racing, spend some time checking them out on Youtube and be amazed with how well the series is simulated here. Fantastic stuff.

												I've put 60+ hours into the NON-STEAM version, the downloadable version from Reiza's website, but decided to immigrate to Steam instead because it's significantly easier to deal with updates, and there's no need to ask for new activation keys if you change the hardware or OS. In other words, getting the game on Steam is much more convenient.Anyway, this game offers something you simply can't get in any other game, and that's no exaggeration. How many other truck racing simulation games have you seen out there ? I actually can't think of any.You get driving physics that is technical and challenging, which is no surprise since it's based on the ISI engine. If you have played Reiza's other games you'll notice that the feel of the game is quite similar when it comes to physics.Sure, the game could be prettier, but a proper PC sim should focus on physics rather than glitter. This game does that; it's a sim game, so you need to practise, practise and practise.There are multiple controller options, which you can fully map and customize. It plays really well with a regular gamepad. However some kind of wheel control will make it smoother to steer. For example if you use a steering wheel or a gamepad with a mini-wheel attached.You also have several Assists- and Difficulty options, so anyone can play this game and be wowed by these powerful machines.The game has real-life tracks and real-life truck brands. If you haven't played Reiza's Stock Car games you'll experience a whole bunch tracks that you won't see in any other racing sim. This is another unique characteristic of a Reiza game.To sum up: if you like sim racing games and/or truck driving games (hello ETS and ATS !) you should give this a go.			"

												All I have to add to the other positive reviews is if this game has good controller support for those without a dedicated racing rig. I can't answer for all the different pads out there but with my 360 controller the answer is a resounding YES!The trucks are, surprisingly, quite easy to manage with a controller even with all driving assists off. Also, you don't need to muck about with too many controller settings except:1) Map your controls accordingly (this is the only area where the game setup falls down, even choosing a 360 pad in the settings will give incorrect inputs for steering etc...), 2) Put speed sensitivity up to around 70% and put a bit of deadzone in for the analog stick, probably around 5-10% depending on your pad. 3) If the steering is too sensitive you can take the x-axis sensitivity down to 0% and have good control, this is what I am currently running it at.Just remember, this is a sim racing game, so you do have to drive appropriately. It will take some time to get used to, but the reward is worth it when you nail it.I have been playing this game quite a bit since before it was released on Steam. Don't let my short playing time displayed so far fool you :)			"

												A friend of mine owned a copy of this and we played a few thousand hours over there, as part of the xmas sale I felt it was time to finaly buy it (along with stock car extream)  that being said. This is not really a game for everyone, this is a hard core sim, and the trucks themselfs are not that easy to drive. its heavy, got lots of torque, and not that agile. but the long breakingzones, and really good drafting and accelration that they do have makes it great at pack racing. Despite logic, the tracks used are tight, often far more narrow then you would want. but, thats what makes this fun.  The ai is top notch and the physics are pretty solid as well. the sounds are also great. that being said, for people with a wheel, I strongly recomend it, for people with only a gamepad,(which I have played half of my hours or more with) its still very playable, but, I would struggle to recomend it as much. If you own stock cars extream and love that, get this and love this as well. overall, i really have to recomend this, especaly when its on sale, really fun, and a great way to waste hours of your life "

 Formula Truck 2013** Key was provided by developer for review purposes**  About the gameThis is a unique, realistic racing game. What makes this unique you may ask? Well in Formula Trucks you race strong, heavy, loud and powerful big rigs against each other instead of the small, fast and boring typical race cars. Take your big rig and race around the track using your truck to decimate the opponents. This game is also very realistic, there is no third person view of the truck, just a first person view as the driver. See yourself as the driver of this massive truck, check your mirrors for other trucks, switch gears, check your blind spots. This is a great game for all hardcore and newer fans of the racing genre.  Is this game worth it?This game is reasonably priced and contains bundles of joy. Its not everday you get to sit behind a massive big rig, or even drive the metal beast. Race across the world on all types of tracks with all types of trucks. Spin out opposing trucks as you race and try not to have your own truck spun. Pros  Get to drive big rigs. Get to race across the world. Lots of trucks to choose from. Realistic controls. Can switch between gears. Look through mirrors and windows. Fun to drive.Cons Confusing trying to start the game To many controls to keep track of. Wish there were a bigger variety of trucks. My final verdictAll in all this is a decent racing game, its very unique and realistic and therefore I rate this a 7.8/10. This game has a lot of potential and room to grow. This is an older version of the series as you can see it is called 2013. I am not sure if there is a 2015 or 2016 version as I am not the biggest racing fan. This game for its age is still a lot of fun and is a ton of fun playing against a group of friends.If you liked this review and would like to see more please check out our curation group Here "

												I got this game because the idea of trucks going fast is hilarious to me. That was a bad decision.After spending 40 minutes navigating the world's most obtuse menus to find the right button to exit the pit lane, I was going around a beautiful track and exiting the tarmac on every corner. No really, unless you're already an expert, judging brake distances is impossible. There's no driving school, and trying to find guides not in Brazilian Portuguese is an exercise in futility. Unless you already know all the ins and outs of driving a REALLY FAST TRUCK you aren't getting anywhere in this game.Considering Reiza Studio's track record, though, I'm sure this is an excellent simulator for the people already in the know. This is probably your only option decent for simulating the act of being in a fast truck, racing against other fast trucks on the various tracks around Brazil. On those terms, I'm sure this will treat you well, but please keep in mind that you won't learn how to drive these trucks with this game.Wheel and pedals with force feedback required.			"

												Not the world's greatest graphics or most exciting racing challenge.  But...there's always a but...it's simply not all that fun. The trucks are pretty cool to look at and listen to but there's nothing else left you can do with them. The turning radius is pretty darn awful, even when you're driving utterly slow and still, the tires wear down fast. The speed is dramatically slower then a car and you never get that racing feel...other then when you hear it spool up. The AI isn't entirely challenging but it gives you a run for it, every now and then. Don't get all gassed up over the trailers, the graphics aren't that great. There's no customizing, no color scheme changes or create a driver option. It's just simple game.  You'll put some hours into racing but you'll get bored quickly. I suggest not to get your hopes up. If you're a customizer...I'd pass. Oh btw...the xbox gamepad controls are a bit funky, good luck configuring!			"

												Impossible to get either the XBox One controller to run the game FUNCTIONALLY (for some reason most controls do not work).... thet would not be so bad, but after fully re-mapping fifty times and getting nowhere, I got more than bored.Got no replies on the forum when I asked for the trick to it....I also tried full re-mapping it all the to the keyboard, but none of those mappings worked either.. So, I get the impression that they used an intellectucal spastic to do the re-mapping coding for this game or something.... because in hundreds of games I have no problem.Until that changes, sadly, its a negative review.

												Don't waste your money, It's literally a stand alone mod of rFactor and not that great of one either. Heck, you could probably find something exactly like this for free on one of the various sites for rFactor mods.			"

												I couldn't figure out the set my gamepad completely. Steering wheel is awfully sensitive with keyboard arrows or even with xbox 360 gamepad! Although Menu view is so simple,controller and racing settings are complicated.And graphics aren't good as you see in the pictures(with full graphic settings) By the way, when i changed the camera angle to the backside of the truck, game begins freezing occasionally. Braking is terrible...Shortly: Totally dissappointment!!I'm very regretful to buy this piece of game !!			"

												Nobody said it´s a mod of rFactor. But it is.No problem, but if you price your mod like that, you should at least work at main themes of a racing game, like AI. They didn´t, it´s as stupid as it´s always been in rF.Physics, graphics and stuff are done well, but it´s all still rF1 out of 2005.			"

												Another great game by Reiza studios and i love driving these beasts, on top of that they sound fantastic. Again same as Stock Car Extreme, the physics and FFB is great, they're fun, i recommend this game.			"

												I've played far more hours of this game then what shows in Steam and just like every other Reiza product, recommend it fully.  If you like trucks and you like racing, then you'll like this game.  If you're on the fence about it, go try the 60 minute demo on Reiza's website and see what you think.  The trucks are different to drive of course.  You'll need to stop sooner and get a feel for how the trucks handle.   This title is classic Reiza though.  The handlng is well done, the tracks are well done, and the force feedback is just right.  I normally use a Logitech Driving Force Pro, but hooked up an XBOX 360 controller and it works just fine as far as controlling the car.  The only negative I can come up with for this review iis that I'd love to see more tracks and trucks but I'm sure that Reiza is working on that.  All in all, a great game at a great price.			"

												This game is amazing, Only issue is that Reiza Studios said they would fix the incompatible issue. They need to remove 1.10 and update that on there site, Casue this is causing steam mismatches and more I had to put V1.25 in my game title. I hope this aint dead if it is then I will be sad this game is amazing. I suggested these updates.-Tire marks on pavement-Smoke out the sides-Smoke on tire in turns-other manufacturers if possible Ford, Scania and whats missing.-Glowing brakes and sparks if you lose a tire or scrape a wall.- Updated Calendar http://www.formulatruck.com.br/calendario.asp "
