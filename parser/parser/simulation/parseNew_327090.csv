								where to start ... i guess i'll start with the prosPros:- graphically the game looks great- runs smooth, performance is good for it only being 9 months old- very good dev team, although i didn't get to speak with any of them (i'll get to that later)- siege warfare PVP (not my thing but still very cool)- boats and gliders, come on thats cool ;)- minor player progression (player gets Efficiencies which affect how much mats you collect in a single hit, or how fast you can craft)Cons:- UI needs an overhaul, top to bottom ... easily the most tedious i've encountered. nothing is clearly outlined, gear slot icons are so faded its hard to tell what item goes into the slot. and since the UI is the one element the player interacts with the most, this is a problem-hit detection is awful, you have to litterally hug a tree to chop it down and the character's swing doesn't line up with the reticle- the character movement feel a little clunky and stiff- every NA server is dead, and even the EU servers cap out at 9 players during peak play times. - player population of the game is only 62 players, and after 9 months i'd expect that to at least be in the 100s- PVE servers are complete dead zones, metal ores don't respawn as they should, in one server i had to swim to 3 different islands before i found my first copper ore node (and that was the only one i found)- resouce costs seemed rather steep, but i didn't get chance to progress very far to see if it balanced out due to lack of metals- every server has hundreds of half built abortions for bases consuming any decent spot to set up in, with no way to remove them. now instead of sucking it up for a server wipe to clean these servers up the community threatened the devs to abandon the game if they did so ... what? ok- overall gameplay is rather stale after a couple hours, unless you are into the PVP then you have an objective other than to survive. - no wiki .... 9 months and not one player has even started a wiki for this game- and finally the biggest con of all .... the community. this community does not recieve new comers very well. one player had asked where to put the backpack in the character screen, instead of just answering the question and moving along, 2 of the community members started making fun of him and saying that he's stupid ... your basic bullying tactics. not a single moderator or dev appeared to intervene, apparently they condone this type of behaviour. i had asked why there wasn't any server wipes or resets, and the only answer i got was ""well we worked hard on our bases"" ... ok granted but this IS and EA game and things of this nature should really be expected, then one player(one of the 2 i mentioned above) started to try to bully me, lol, well after 2 or 3 of his posts i admit i'm guilty, i only kept posting to push his buttons ... well he quickly resorted to name calling and profanity (still no moderator in sight) then later on edited, and re-edited every one of his posts to seem more tame. it was a good laugh. then i made a thread asking where the moderators or the devs were, spoke with one player (the other one) who asked if i was wanting to be a mod ... not my thing, however i did offer to help set up a wiki for the game ..... my thread was deleted. i don't recommend this game simply due to a horrible community presence, the game itself has a great start and has great potential but don't expect to be ""allowed"" to contribute any criticisms because you will be harrassed on the forums.if you decide that you do want this game, i strongly suggest scanning their forums first.i can't really say much in part of the devs themselves (other than they are doing a good job and they work hard on their game) as i didn't have a chance to actually speak with one, even briefly.

								2 buddies and I got this game, got weapons and armor and built a base that had 5 wooden doors which we thought might keep us alittle safe. A bandit in bronze armor came, chopped through our doors in under a minute and killed us just as quick. 3 men with non-bronze armor  stood NO chance against 1 man in bronze armor. When the bandit learned that it would be 2 real life days before he could get any loot he left to go kill fresh spawns. We upgraded our doors to metal with what little bronze we could find but that only slowed him down alittle when he came back to kill us. Which he did easily.Cons-Raiding requires that you capture and hold an enemy base for upto 72 real life hours before you get any loot for your efforts unless you destroy the builders desk.-Building isn't effected by gravity so you can build a base so high in the air it cannot be attacked with a treb. making raiding it impossible.-The boat requires spamming the Use buttons on both paddles so your boating experiance is you staring at paddles.-A man can burn your boat with a torch so if your out on your boat coming back to land and you see someone on the beach you MUST murder them or they may burn your boat.-Murdering people increases your fighting stats promoting Kill On Sight-Getting tired from sprinting plays an audio clip of a man thats out of breath but in the recording you can hear static and the recording itself cut off like it was recorded on a tape player.-Textures are rough and I get half the FPS that I do on Rust which looks far better.-On the servers that I played on the mines were mostly controlled by clans in bronze armor that killed anyone who got near the mine so getting ore was near impossible.-No server admins and the /report function didn't seem to do anything so expect the chat to be filled with racism/homophobic talk.-Until you level up your resource gathering is very slow.-Animal AI is laughable as I shoot a rhino and it runs around a few seconds before stopping like nothing happened. All animals can easily be out run and pose little threat. Hunting is nothing more than a grind to get the materials you need.-Plants (Such as flax) always grow in the same spot so experianced players farm it all out while noobs can never seem to find any.-Everyone spawns in on the same somewhat small island that cannot support the amount of players on it so lack of resources and starvation is common.-Doors provide little to no protection so expect to log into a base with no doors or bed because anyone with a rock can break through a wood door.-Healing is done by eating food and the healing is instant so if your fighting run away for a moment, eat some food and instantly be back at 100%. While being raided we shot the raiders with bows but they just hid behind a rock and healed so it quickly became boring.-There is no base decay so the landscape is littered with bases which decreases your FPS. I have been near large bases which tanked my FPS from 50 down to 10 so if you build a big base you will be penalized by a large FPS drop.pros-You can burn stuff with a torch.			"

								Out of Reach is by far the best survival game i've played. I have almost 700 hours in game and have played the game for about 9 months. It is pirate themed game where you have been shipwrecked on tropical islands. Just like most survival games you have to gather food and resources to keep you alive and build up a base. Depending on the type of server you play your experiance will change.PvE: ~ No PvP~ Harder to find areas to build as there is no raiding~ Good way to learn the game before starting PvP~ Some players like to roleplay and trade~ Players are more friendlyStandard:~ PvP enabled~ Raiding enabled~ Hardest gather speed~ Resources are more valuable~ Base protection (depending on the resources invested) between 3 hours - 3 days~ Slower paced in terms of development~ More spaces to build- Players will either attack you or help you   (My opinion the best type of server to play as I find it the most fun) PvP:~ PvP enabled~ Raiding enabled~ Easiest gather speed (up to x5)~ Resources are less valuable~ Base protection (depending on the resources invested) between 1 minute - 15 minutes~ Faster paced~ Usually very built up~ You're most likely going to die alot if you havn't played the game beforeThis game is very unique to other games such as Rust and Ark. Yes it isn't as developed as these games or as popular but personally I have played Rust and would recommend this game over it. Rust doesn't give me the rush I have when playing this game. PvP in this game is a little glitchy and can have some improvements in terms of smoothness however it gets me really hyped and me and my group really enjoy PvP in this game. Whereas compared to Rust you could walk around and get one shotted from 100m away and not know where he was or have any way to fight back. However in this game you have to choose carefully what armour you choose and sometimes combine the different tiers of armour to fit your purpose. In this game you can be a slow tank walking around in metal armour or a fast archer running in leather armour.Resource gathering is very painful, just like any survival game, the grind is hard but it adds more value to it. This game requires lots of hard decision making on 'Shall I bring this armour out?' 'Do I want to carry this must resources with me at once or shall I take multiple trips?' However with the animations when farming it can be very fun. Such as falling trees when they run out of use instead of vanishing like Rust. Or possibly the breaking  up of stones when rocks are no longer filled with stones to give you. Crafting in this game is very unique. You require different tools and crafting areas to make tools. But what makes this game even more interesting is the fact you have to load an anvil with a casted part from your furnace and physically hit it with a hammer until it is shaped. Something I havn't seen any other game do.And my favourite part, raiding. I have never felt so satisfied raiding in any survival game other than this game. There is a range of ways to infiltrate a base: trebuchet, glider, seige projectiles. Sometimes you have to use all of them to bring down a base. They all have their strengths and weaknesses and makes the game great!One of the cons of the game is map size. The map can't really fit 30 or more players in it. There aren't many spawn points so you find new spawns running into eachother, one getting killed and then refunding the game. Although there are plans for new islands and improving spawn locations.This game is heavily worked on and the devs are very open to the community on suggestions and advise. I have seen features I have requested implemented in this game and bugs I have reported fixed within a patch.Lastly there is only one issue I have with this game, population, many people buy the game on sale and refund it without giving it a chance. Most just say 'rust is better' and leave within 5 minutes of joining. Or people get so mad that they lose a base and quit the game completely. I have seen this alot and it is sad to see as this is such a good game. Most just need to get over it and start again and improve what got them killed last time. That is the best attitude to have. Honestly you should stop reading reviews and give the game a go, you will not be disappointed. If you have any questions about the game add me on steam or would like some help starting out do the same.			"

								I have been shopping around for a good survival game after a brief brush with Day Z, and have been putting a lot of thought into the different game options out there. I'm happy to say I finally pulled the trigger on Out of Reach a couple of weeks ago, and believe I made a great decision. Good enough to write my first review anyways! I wanted to be sure I had the hang of the game, as I heard crafting menus were strange and certain combat aspects were glitchy. I joined a pretty low-key server at the bottom of the list just to be sure my sub-par ""gaming"" laptop could handle it. So far so good, and the low population server is great because I'm not pressured to defend myself, grind for competing resources, or worry about how well my base is constructed. Whether you view low player count as a positive or negative, I do feel pretty lonely when I'm 1/75 spots available...  With only 9.6 hours on record over the two week span (as of this review), I've progressed much further than I anticipated. Instead of constantly griding to survive, I've spent a good chunk of time crafting useful items, exploring, getting plowed by rhinos, and investigating some of the abandoned bases that those before me have left behind. Just the other day, the devs released gliders, which will allow you to fly around the map. I haven't had the chance to try it out, but it is nice to see notable updates already. If you're looking for a great survival type game, this is it. I'm really excited to see what other features are released in the future, and hope I'm able to convince some fellow gamers to join in and populate these servers. There is so much potential to be shared, and I hope this has provided a bit of insight from a somewhat casual gamer's perspective.EDIT: I revised/removed my original (and unfair) comments comparing it to Day Z.

								""Смотрите русский перевод ниже""It is a very nice survival game to play. It's still on alpha test, but surprisingly well polished for an early alpha though. You can craft tools, weapons and equipment from stone, bones, bronze & steel. It's an open world with caves and a few islands. You can travel in between islands by boat or swim to some of the islands. You can build a small cozy house, bigger base or even a castle if you determine enough. Make your own Tribe/Clan if you feel this way. Also, you can make your own garden to grow berries, flux fiber or wheat. Fishing is also been implemented. You can also find a pirate chests with some gold coins and wheat seeds inside as well.If you into killing you'll need to get used to in game mechanics first. It's quite hard to get that bow skill, but you can master it in a few weeks.Mostly people in game are friendly and there is no constant ""killing on side"".The skills system is also under development, but already implemented.Overall, I would recommend this game for anyone who likes survival games with a great community and no modern weapons.Please consider though that this game is still under development, so you may discover a new bugs. However, developers are very quick on fixing the issues and you can see them on the server asking for what they can improve. Quite impressive if you ask me.Only the official servers are available and plenty to chose from, from normal, to PvP and PvE. We never had wipes before, no random admins either. ______________________________________________________________Это очень интересная survival игра. Она все еще на стадии альфа теста, но довольно отполирована для ранней альфы. Вы можете создать разнообразные инструменты, оружие и снаряжение  из камня, костей, бронзы или стали. Это открытый мир с пещерами и несколькими островами. Вы можете путешествовать на лодке или переплыть на некоторые из островов самостоятельно. Вы можете создать маленький уютный дом, базу или даже замок если у вас хватит терпения. Создайте свое племя/клан если вам так захочется. Так же, вы можете посеять свой огород с ягодами, льном или пшеницей. Рыбалку тоже уже сделали. Вы также можете найти пиратские сундуки с золотыми монетами и семенами пшеницы.Если вам больше по нраву убивать, то сначало вам надо привыкнуть к механике в игре. Это довольно сложно по началу, быть точным с луком, но практикуясь вы сможете отточить свой навык в течение пары недель.Большинство народу в игре доброжелательные и нету частого kos, убийства при встрече.Система навыков находится на стадии разработки, но уже присутствует в игре.В целом, я рекомендую эту игру всем, кому по нраву survival жанр без современного оружия и с отличным комюнити.Пожалуйста имейте ввиду, что игра еще в стадии разработки, так что возможно вы сможете обнаружить баги. Однако, разработчики очень отзывчивые и исправляют их в кратчайшие сроки (24 часа). Вы часто сможете увидеть их онлайн интересующихся тем, что они могут исправить или улучшить. Довольно удивительное явление если вы спросите меня.Только официальные сервера доступны в настоящее время, от обычных до PvP и PvE. У нас не было еще вайпов или рандомных админов.			"

								Let me start by saying that this game is propably the most underrated game on steam.I am a veteran rust player with 1000+ hours on rust, and this game is giving everything that i always wanted from rust.The graphics are quite good, not great but really quite good, the devs keep updating the game and it is becoming better all the time. It is quite similar to rust as in crafting, building and overall mechanics, but with this little bit more. For example, you can just burn other players structures to the ground an totally and utterly destroy everything the player has worked for, wich is a big pro in so far, as this can be done to you too. This fact makes the game more unpredictable and more fun. You can also craft boats (including engines if you find the materials) and you can explore everything.But best is this stranded, piraty vibe to the game that makes it so different from any other survival game out there.Dont get me wrong, i love rust to bits, but this is just something else. Out of reach is superior in its own sectors.The only thing goofy (just to look at) is player movement and meele combat. But i recon they will soon come up with something.Also the crafting is genius. You actually have to forge stuff, by hitting it in the right spot while its lying on your anvil.This is the♥♥♥♥♥♥i was looking for.I would recommend this game any day, any time.To the devs: Keep going, you are making a fantastic game!

								Bought a new game today $14.99 - worth it so far. Only 5 hours in and having a blast. It reminds me of rust legacy only with a much larger map and crafting system. There are pvp and pve servers up - not a lot of players but lots to do. First and third person view with a hidden map that reveals as you explore. Base building with upgrades and a ""snap"" system that let's you be creative! I found a huge underground cavern and was three levels deep when I decided to turn back for fear of death due to lack of food. I haven't hunted successfully yet but the animals seem to be running in herds and quite fast! There are also steerable rafts and gliders so you can explore the ocean and the sky - If you're looking for a decent survival experience at a fair price check this out - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/survivalgaminginc==================EDIT: 5-20-16 - 260 hours in and still no regrets! Worth every penny ...==================EDIT: 6-1-16:200.5 hrs last two weeks / 326.7 hrs on record:I've learned a lot this last month and without a doubt this is one of my better investments. For $15 I've received over 300 hours of entertainment!Some fun times some sad times ...I've lived I've died I've been eaten by tigers and slayed by men.I've built massive bases explored caves gone sailing climbed mountains and I've even been deep sea diving! There are so many things to do in this game and with devs like we have I see a lot more to come.

								First play:PvE serverMet a player who had built a massive stone tower. Decided to form a clan, he taught me the basics, went off to an island and chose a beautiful spot to build a roman villa with an atrium.PvP serverI decided against making a house because I figured the players would be a bit more aggressive. They were far better armed than me, (armour, swords), 3-4 of them living in a fortress on a mountain.  So I lived as a wanderer, poaching deer and collecting berries out in the deserted areas during the day. At night I would creep into the area inhabited by a clan and forage around for unprotected things. They got pretty miffed firing arrows at me any time I was spotted, but nothing game-breaking, I could always run off if I needed to.Felt a bit like DayZ without the guns, in pvp people have territories of a sort where they do most of their activities. Just depends if/who you team up with.~~~They've very finely tuned the multiplayer aspect. Graphics should be pretty startling if you have a decent rig. Even on simple the foliage and sunrays/moonrays are impressive. It could do with a few more players, but there are enough to get along with already.Looks very promising, think this will be successful.			"

								I bought this game back in September, and played it for around a week or so.  Eventually I became bored, having done basically everything you could on a pve server.  While I'm not that much into pvp, at that point in time that was the one thing keeping this game from becoming boring too fast.  Anyway, I logged on today and found a surprising amount of updates had been done, not only did the ui look much nicer, some bugs had been fixed (such as crashing when logging out) , and more content had been added.  All I can say is if this game continues in this direction, it will be an extremely fun game to play once it is finished.			"

								One year in early access, and the most recent monthly patch added a torch holder to the extremely limited build menu.  A Torch Holder...   The really really small map size should limit this game to 10 players at a time (""M"" is for Mini in this MMO)  Fortunately for me, there were never more than 2-4 peeps on the 2 different official PVE servers I played on.To be fair, PvP with friends on a private server for 7 bucks each, I can see it... maybe.  Another year or two for the ""indie"" developer(s) and this might be worth spending a few bucks on. But, competition in the survival niche is tough with other true Indie Developers doing great work so I doubt this title survives in anything other than the Steam .99 cent bargain bin. Another example of a garage based 'indie' that never really has the time or resources to expand the idea past a rough sketch.  If this had JUST been released, I'd be more forgiving.  But after 2 years, the last with Steam Fan Support (and money)  This horse is never gonna see the finish line.   Pass on this one.			"

								I've played Rust, LIF, ROK, ARK and now Out of Reach.  Great game for what I'm comparing it too that has it's own style.  Content still isn't fully there - need more animals, gear and some terrain additions for sure, but gameplay is very addictive.  I would call it a mix between ROK, LIF and Rust.  There are no sleepers which some of you may enjoy - when you log off your stuff own your body is safe.  It's nice but also a little lame after playing so many sleeper games.Raiding is interesting, you can break doors easy but can't loot boxes if the person has a building station which you have to destroy and then wait for a time to expire (3 hrs+) before you can look the boxes.  I thought this was really lame at first but it adds a new dimension of exploring, finding a raided base full of loot and you didn't do the raiding.  It's like finding buried treasure.I will keep playing for a while, seems a bit too easy at the moment.  I have about 15 hours in and can get full bronze equip, boat, etc.  I raid and kill people pretty easily but have also gotten killed.Not sure when people were saying there isn't much KOS because I was KOSed so much the first day that I'm playing it like Rust now - kill first and ask questions later.Hope you join us because it really needs more players.  Servers seem to max out at about 20 players at some point in the day right now and even though it's decent, we could use more.Oh I forgot to mention fires!  When someones building permissions expire you can set their base on fire and burn it down.  This is lovely to watch and works great for cleaning up the abandoned buildings.When you first start, look for an abandoned base that already has a furnace and an anvil.  Put your own building station in and add some doors and it will be your base.  This is what I did on my first play through and it helped speed things up alot because those tools were already there for me.Get it while it's on sale because it's worth $12 if you like survival games.

								Explore the ocean to find islands and resources you can't find on the main island where you initially spawn. Explore caves to mine copper and tin to make bronze weapons, tools and armor. Forage and hunt for food, or grow your food in garden plots as well as flax for linen once you find the seeds to do so from foraging the crops in the wild. Chop wood and mine stone to create the base you want to give you the advantage. Lay siege to destroy and plunder enemy bases.

								Spawn in, get wood, stone and flax fibers. Make a spear and a wooden shield. Find a player, team or kill. Take loot. Make a base that looks epic. Go into caves and get copper and tin to make bronze in a furnance. Craft a sword by running a rough blade through the furnance and then beat the hell out of it with a hammer on the anvil. Use the smithy to finish it off. Get hide armour. (There is hide, bronze and iron armor which are ubgradeable) (Armor parts are crafted individualy) Make a bow. Hunt, make a boat. Go to another island and get iron. And then die. Start over until you get it right. Awesome battles in the ocean with ballistas and bows (I torched their boat) LoL. Great game. No guns only a bow as as ranged weapon and picks, axes, clubs, swords, hammers etc as a close quarters weapon. Really a very good game. The pvp is about skill(Mostly) Get It if in doubt. Didnt like it just ask for a refund.			"

								Do not pay attention to all these negative reviews. Just look at them... They are written by some dimwits who played the game for 0.1 hrs and refunded it. Yet they feel eligible to write a review and tell everyone how boring it is.It is a good game and it's nearing its release. Combat is smooth (surprisingly) and ismilar to M&B. It is more player-firendly than most other survival games. Here you can upgrade your builder's desk (the heart of your base) and prolong the defence time (during which you can simply reclaim all your stuff) up to 72 hrs. One might say it's nearly impossbile to deprive a player of his base. This will require huge effort so some griefing idiots will only break your doors and kill you. You won't log in one day and find yourself naked on some beach with absolutely nothing.There are boats, gliders, hunting, crafting, cooking, farming, building, pvp, caves, islands etc.Feel free to add me if you want to know more or have any questions.

								Ok lets look at OOR from an all around point of view here.Pros...good solid game for early acces           great dev team, they want this to improve and often update           good balance of looks and content            and again great dev team, when they find exploits they fix them as quickly as they can           Some good players that are willing to helpCons...If you're looking for stranded deep...omg the graphics are incredible I could watch the sunset for hours not                  going to get it here, but then again stranded deep has horribly low content            Some really bad players will attempt to ruin your playing experience simply to get streaming hits...and they're                   willing to cheat to get it Overall i'd say for the price amazing game, i'm enjoying it myself and would recommend it to anyone that likes sandbox survival.  I can't wait from patch to patch just to see what goodies are in there! "

								Id been looking at this game for awhile, and finally I decided to go for it.  I really, really like this game!  The building / gathering actually takes time to do, it's not just 'click I'm done'.  Players are VERY friendly, and there are PvE servers available.  Not being part of the Early Acsess for long, I think I've made a good investment into this game.  Updates are posted regularly, to keep players in the loop.Overall, you should really try the game.9/10			"

								Honestly this game is great. Doesn't take a lot to run it, i run it on my laptop. The crafting system is really unique and there's a lot of armor and weapons to create. There is so much potential to create more upgrades like for the shields and arrows for example. Not too many people on the servers but there's one that has like 20 people on it and the fighting is pretty good. Great game, i will continue to play it.			"

								Overall: excellent game, solid gameplay and a logical progression.Pros:- Easy to use building system.- Decent combat system- Logical progression (easy to follow route from starting out)Cons:- Animations could use a little workI would totally recommend this game, it's much better than similar games (eg, Reign Of Kings), and I'd love to see more players on the servers.

								Earliest review from June 2015) First impressions wasn't a bad experience for this early access release. A friend and I managed to craft some tools, made a bow with arrows, friend tried to hunt animals which gave a Code 12 bug on a Rhino and a Code 8 bug on a Tiger. Both animals wouldn't die! Found a few more resources here`n there while soaking up the island atmosphere. However, various errors and glitches as with any other early survival title are to be expected. Be sure to do it all again when OoR improves over time. (Updated review 11/25/2016)IMHO, this indi title ""life as a pirate"" would have to be ultimately the best up to date MP, Crafting, Base building and Tactical Melee and Seige Combat for pillaging and plundering to have come our way. Having now spent over 2K hrs of gameplay and making many valuable friendships on the journey of the high seas, there is a deep sense of satifaction on all levels to cater for your style of play. Out of Reach will never grow old! Special thanks to the Dev team @ SpaceBoatStudios for their ongoing commitments, dedication and support.			"

Early Access Review
								Hey!I have now about 35 hours played so i thought id post a review about this game for future buyers. Since i got the game 3 days ago i have pretty much played nonstop. The game is very addictive!This game is not the easiest and you are never completely safe even if you do have a strong base, every time you go out to get some ore you are at risk because there is nothing in the game that will make you unkillable. It takes some time to get the gear going and in my opinion thats a great thing because people cant just craft good gear in a matter of 20 minutes and go and kill people like in allot of these so called ""survival"" games (*cough* Rust *cough cough*).There is a fair amount of content in the game right now there are gazelles, zebras, rhinos, hippos, tigers and crocodiles for wildlife and you can hunt these animals to get food and other materials. They will of course be adding more wildlife as updates roll in because that would make sense. As for crafting there is enough to keep you going back to the caves for ores but the crafting could use some more items. Bugs and glitches are to be expected but i havent really noticed anything major. Overall i will actually recommend this game already! "

								Not yet, folks. This game is an interesting concept with interesting gameplay features, but the UI and controls are about as intuitive as Rube Goldberg's roller-skates. Wait a year, check back, see if they've fixed it.			"

								on most servers the biggest clan/the clan who owns the server completely locked off the access to the only island that has iron on it. that means on nearly all servers everybody else is stuck at bronze and that's that. no progress possible.=> ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game design => ♥♥♥♥ this game			"

								A strong foundation for a genre that has seen some lackluster titles. Most developers will over promise and under provide but my experience with the developers of OOR are quite the opposite. There is balance that will push the player to think outside of the box and use the community to further their rise to power. It also serves to keep players from being ""godly"" as an unstoppable force of destruction, raining terror on all the newcomers.This game is a hidden gem in a genre that has a reputation of letting players down. I've never seen hackers that plague other games and thorough enjoy a spot in a lead clan and being hunted as an unknown on another server. It's all immersion here and the developers drop by often to hear our feedback.The price point should encourage a lot of ppl to give it a try and promote quality over a rushed product.			"

Early Access Review
								This is my first review of a game so ill try to be as fair as i can be with this game.Ill get some of the more... Annoying, things out of the way. Yes, i do understand the game is still an early access and yes they do have a long way to go, but the devs are juggling a lot right now, trying to get the optimization just right and fixing bugs as well as adding new content. Although they do seem to skip over some stuff like arrows glitching and such. but most of the stuff that is Wrong is very minor, thank god it isn't major otherwise i wouldn't have played for as long as i have. As of right now the Game has a Cap, there is no goal that is ""Out of Reach"", if you knew what you were doing you could probably have full bronze equipment in a few hours. The player base is Very small therefore making it hard to enjoy with others seeing as how they have a HUGE server list making it to where the players can go to different servers starting anew on each one. the only real downside i see to that is that the game isn't popular enough for them to need that many servers. The servers can become very...Cluttered, as well. many of the people who buy the game then quit leave their stuff behind, I.e. Buildings that have been claimed and cant be gotten rid of. so it does cause some frame issues when you have a lot of buildings to register on your screen. again not major stuff just minor irritants.Now time for the stuff I do like a lot about the game. I myself and some of the other people i happen to play with are very friendly, now im not gonna say everyone is because this game is a survival and fighting is part of the learning process. the game has a very easy crafting system and building is fun and easy as well. you can do a lot in the game. even with a ""Cap"" on what you can do. i still have fun by just going hunting or talking with the other players. you dont have to fight but its a good way to enjoy the game and if you can find enough people to enjoy it with, there is even a clan system so you can set a base and work your way from there. the bugs are very minor and hardly noticeable unless you go looking for them, and when they do happen you can simply log out and log back in to reset your connection to the server. this game is very fun and i still have a blast fighting players with the same set of skills as me, they recently added farming and they plan to expand that even more, the Devs work hard and i applaud them for their efforts they are very consistent with keeping the players informed and are always providing responses fairly quickly for players having issues with the game.Its not a lot about the game, just some key subjects but its on its way to becoming better than what it started as. my only suggestions are adding extra items to the game, such as better weapons and armor crafting. but if you want something to kill time and people with a satisfactory hut or fort or tower to lay your head at then this game is for you. Recommend it to your friends, start a clan, fight the raiders or be the raiders.Honestly a damn good survival 10/10			"

								So far so good, it is an alpha in the very over populated survival genre, but it has some unique concepts and ability to secure what you've built for when your offline that a lot of other games lack.			"
