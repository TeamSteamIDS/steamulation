												If you remember old machine games from 80's and early 90's, stratO is game that will revoke your memories with unique gameplay and impressive music. stratO will build up your brain cells and fingers muscles. If you are willing to master it  controls that will allow you to have full control of every aspect of plane you will sure enjoy this game.If you are looking for competitive, hardcore game that will use your maximum skill of your game playing this is game for you !NOTE: If you are looking for easy casual game, or you are to lazy to spend time mastering it, this game isnt for you.My toughts are:Music: 5/5Graphic: 4/5Gameplay: 3/5Overal rating :4/5Why? Because it brings fresh gameplay with unique controls. This is something that old school gamers need. With global leader board, Im sure it will bring us much fun competing each other.			"

												Not for the faint of heart. With a large learning curve and very unique gameplay elements, Strat0 challenges you constantly as you learn to fly. It's a remote-control paper airplane with rockets and magnetic wings flying through a space that seems to try to kill you at every turn. You can casually glide between the upper and lower ""zones"" and collect the rings in the middle or you can magnetize your wings, boost downward and aeleron roll through 3 rings while columns and pillars burst into existence almost faster than you can react. And just when you think the game is starting to get easy and routine, WAM! it cranks up the difficulty in a mesmerizing burst of light, color, and shadows. Seriously... try to get as many rings as you can without getting stuck. I beleive!			"

												One of the best random buys I have ever made. I know it says its not casual but I find it very relaxing. The controls on your plane are simple two handed WASD (and IJKL) and they give you such amazing control. Took me about an hour to get good enough at grinding walls to be able to reliably enter dubstep mode but I was having a great time soaring about within 20 minutes. Its hard enough to be challenging but you're so in control that if you want to take it easy you can head down and take a break just peacefully collecting Os until you're ready for some more intense action.The camera follows you really well and creates a fluid sense of continuity and imersion, the aesthetic and the music are quite well put together, the sounds blend in without disturbing the music, the respawns are seamless. I really just love how well everything meshes.Be careful about try-harding though. Actions have consequences.Still amazing, I hope we see more from the developer!			"

												I have tried to figure this game out, it looks cool, innovative & different (it is what captured my interest to buy), but nothing makes sense! I have never felt so lost in a game in years! Flying aimlessly trying to understand the controls first, then what is benefitial to do and what is not. Controls are not intuitive, but that is fine, I do like a challenging game. They are very sensitive though and rather unforgiving with a controller. Precision of this does improve as you play further, and taking into account the physics better as you fly.Sometimes a number in the bottom right of the screen goes up then it goes back to zero, I hit things and stall or go faster doesn't seem to make any difference as I haven't been able to find a way to die or string anything together consistently to start to piece together the obscure game mechanics. Sometimes a special move pops up in the bottom left corner that I dont really know how I did it or how to combine these to get something/anything going. Gather I am meant to get the circles, but not sure what that does. I get a few circles, then the string of them often disappear into the fog (I guess I go the wrong direction perhaps)? What are the hazards, should I avoid hitting things or not, or go faster/slower, or just get the circles as quickly as possible.. I'm so confused.There is a HUD which has no explaination to it (a bunch of circles and other symbols/colours that change as you move around), nor what to do to get any score or navigate through the endless level. Procedural generation is basic from what I have seen with the same shapes with high level of fog to hide things from view. Felt like I was going around & around which becomes somewhat nausiating.Graphics do look nice in the simplistic style used though - they have depth when coupled with the fog effects. Audio/music gets rather repetitive in a short time although it does add some nice atmosphere to the game & complements the graphic set. No real complaints here other that the HUD/UI I have previously mentioned.With a game with such abstract game mechanics the lack of any type of tutorial, guide, manual or explaination on what is the goal is or how to play is baffling. This might be a great game but without any explaination on the mechanics, scratching my ball sack is more enjoyable. I am clearly in the minority looking at the primarily positive reviews, but in my time playing it has been unenjoyable & frustrating. I like a hard game, a game of skill (as the store page suggests this is), but at least explain the basic rules first!Update post Devs comments: I have watched the brief introduction instructional video linked in the comments and also found an extended advanced 22 minute video on the channel that I have also watched. This does help explain some of the mechanics of the game and some of the possible moves you can do. To be fair, I returned to the game to give it another try and did find my initial frustrations diminished to a degree. I was able to string together some higher scores & get some of the achievements. Saying this, I do still maintain that the game needs better explaination for new players and should not need to search online to see how to play.Once you get start getting the hang of the plane controls & physics, the game becomes more enjoyable, but ultimately I do not see this as a game I would come back to play regularly. Other than getting a higher score the game itself is repetitive with the same scenery, sound effects/audio & layouts (which do progressively get harder to navigate). Wall grinding seems to be the best option to increase your score, but I did try for the circles to see if I could progress and hit a few of the harder achievements. Finite control still eludes me so hitting a bullseye of a circle for example was next to impossible & the HUD still seemed redundant (or I did not pick up what the circles and symbols mean from the videos). Also, it is hard to judge how close to the bottom of the map you are where (I now know) your score resets.I always admire a dev who is willing to try something different and not churn out the same game or game mechanics we have seen in a 100 other titles. This is a good effort, and enjoyable to a point once the game was understood, but there is not enough content or variety, and does still need better explaination of the mechanics for new players.

												Pilot Wings 64 meets Tony Hawk endless mode on Acid. Tighter, albeit more difficult controls with similarly addictive gameplay and a great sound-track.This game CAN be played on keyboard, but you are putting yourself at a great disadvantage. This game plays the best on a 360/XBone controller.This is the definition of a great arcade game. Fast paced action, tricky, combo building, and the craziness only grows more out of control as your score increases. The ONLY possible negative here would be the learning curve. Prepare to up your hand/eye coordination game. 10/10, would bang.			"

												This is an amazing game, let me tell you why;I've been following his developer on his live stream since he started working on stratO and the greatest thing I can say is he has accomplished to create a really hard flying game, it's learning curve is really sharp but once you get used to it it will give you some kind of feeling.For me, that feeling is tranquility, I start playing it with some drum n' bass music on the background and I can easily play for two hours without stop. It's just the flow it achieves that makes it so great.			"

												My stratO experience is one of the more unique experiences with a steam game.I started out confused and frustrated. I went to the forums and complained about the lack of tutorial and how confusing the controls were.One of the forum moderators added me almost instantly, walked me through some of the basics, watched a broadcast of me playing, and then had me watch a broadcast of him playing. After that, I kind of knew what was goin on, but still felt lost.Then the developer himself got on the forums and posted a 22 minute comprehensive tutorial. I watched the whole thing and after my next flight I got my first achievement.1.3 hours of gameplay later, after all of that, I still feel like a complete n00b, and am still very lost as to what I'm doing when playing, but I'm starting to figure it out little by little.And, with each little bit I figure out, I'm more and more impressed by how groundbreaking this game is.I am going to recommend this game, but with the warning that if you're not ready to go through a serious amount of learning just to figure out the basics, this might not be worth your time.However, if you're craving something new and insanely challenging, buy this now.Also, I'd like to point out that the dev and moderator who helped me are two of the nicest and most patient people I've come across on Steam, and should get a medal just for dealing with crazy people like me :)			"

												The learning curve can be a bit steep in this game, but STICK WITH IT, as the feeling you get from finally getting in sync with the finely tuned control over your aircraft is extremely satisfying.  You will be able to navigate some surprisingly intricate pathways once you get your head around it.  Very rewarding.I should also mention the game music.  This guy is simply genius, and I hope that he puts out a soundtrack as DLC.The only knock I can place on the game is that I would have preferred to have a little more structure to the content.  Endless high score runs are enjoyable, but give me a set of tasks to accomplish that build up my skills.  That would do much to alleviate the steep learning curve.BUY IT!			"

												Hello, Welcome to startO.  Take a moment to check your creases, make sure those folds are right, then  lastly make sure to throw it just right.  StratO takes you into the world of arcade paper aircraft flying, letting you take control of individual flaps, breaks, and more down to the direction they are currently. There is near 8-9 keys in total to control the aircraft. What is your goal you ask? To fly around, trying to score points by flying into floating rights. You gain more points by different moves, if you hit the bullseye, or if your in the games ""other world"" called B-Side.  Don't worry if at first you cannot figure out how to fly, or if you just keep crashing. Like they say with learning to ride a bike, get up & try again.  Each time it gets easier, and easier, that is until the game decides to troll you and spawn a pillar right in front of your plane with you failing to react in time :).  This game is worth the full retail value, is made by a wonderful and talented developer that listens to criticism.   You should definitely pick this game up, you wont regret it .In the words of  lemec ""Let's airplane! Together!""			"

												Oh man, what to say about StratO. I honestly wasn't sure if I was going to like it, I've been a fan of the developers streams for a while but wasn't sure if this was quite my cup of tea. The game seems brutally difficult at first, but upon a few trail and error attempts and reviewing the controls, I found myself becoming more and more accustomed to the gameplay. Within the first twenty minutes I was coasting off of walls and blasting through rings at lightning speed! The gameplay get's very intense, as you scrape by buildings at blazing speeds you'll hear gusting winds as the camera shakes vigorously giving you that feeling as if you're an ace pilot in a big budget action film! It makes the game's learning curve SO worth it! The biggest plus for me however, is the game seems to adapt to any style of play. If you're looking to collect rings as fast as you can, scoring multiple bullseyes while preforming skill chains will phase the player into what is known as ""B-side"", were rings scored will award double the points but it's significantly harder in the process. However if you're looking for something more laid back and chill, you can traverse the map at a laid back pace and still remain competitive against other players.There is no ineffective way to play this game, and that's probably the game's strongest feature. Some have stated that this game is anti casual. I'd argue the opposite. Once you take the time to learn the controls and physics of StratO, it's very easy to log in, play it for ten minutes, and go back to your work space feeling completely satisfied! Gameplay: 5/5 - Difficult to learn at first, but after a while it all starts to make sense. The physics are incredible!Graphics:   4/5 - Simple but effective. Nothing looks awkward or out of place. The lighting in some of the later maps is beautiful! Soundtrack: 4/5 - Clever use of game mechanics that change the in game music while rocket boosting make it hard to resist muting the music for something else. The in game music, particularly the ""default"" map track which is most commonly used is great! It's not too fancy and fits the atmosphere well. My only complaint is there needs to be more music tracks for the game to swap through as you get into the later maps.Story: not applicable - It's an arcadey game, what'd you expect? "

												Well, this game is intense.In Grand Theft Auto, do you ever fly planes downtown, dodging between buildings? That's kind of like what this game is like, if the buildings fell from the sky at every possible angle, and your plane has no working engine. You always feel like you're 3 seconds from doom, because you usually are. And it's great.I stumbled upon this game by chance, because the guy who made it was streaming his development on twitch. That was several months ago, and man is it polished since I first saw it. It just oozes ""game feel"", and I hope it gets the attention it deserves.PROS:*It's fun. It's intense. Neat plane physics.CONS:*Personally I found the default controls hard to use, and it was a bit confusing to change them because you have to use the scroll wheel (I think) to cycle through them, instead of just having a menu.*There's no in-game guide yet, but I think he's working on that.

												First of all, let me start by saying that this is one of the few games i have purchased without reading the reviews. I caught Mark Chong the Developer on his twitch stream and that was my first exposure. I succumbed to what i saw playing out in front of me. The dual wasd style control had me skeptical at first but then as i got better i understood that this is what makes it shine. Definitely has a learning curve but once you get the controls down a bit the game begins. A paper airplane in cyberspace aiming for that pefect bullseye in the rings while dodging dangerous building like structures that only get more diabolical and obtrusive the further you progress. But to  grind and slide against the structures  stacking speed boosts to hear that sweet dubstep music start up makes it all worthwhile.  Interesting mix of Hype and Zen ! 10/10 would recommend!			"

												More Reveiws @ TheVideogameBacklog.comstratO is a game that I feel needs some advice given before even starting this review. There are a few strategies online for stratO (even by the developer) mentioning a few different tactics, but I have to admit that one tactic rises above the rest. That strategy is to pick one set of controls (like the left and right air brakes) and while not trying to fly through rings, just get used to what those specific controls do to the plane. Just focus on those buttons while trying to avoid the giant blocks. That’s it; rinse and repeat for additional controls. This should help the learning curve. It’s weird and feels pointless, but it does work.That said, I was frustrated with the controls since I couldn’t configure them the way I wanted to, that and there seemed to be a lot of buttons. Changing the controls wasn’t exactly straightforward, but I eventually did figure it out. Instead of getting used to what the developer had set up, I was trying to set up controls that the game refused to let me use. I was trying to assign two different controls to the joysticks and while it would work on the control setup screen, it wouldn’t work in-game. Eventually I gave up and just used what I was given and I then got used to it and the 100 rings in a row achievement. I feel I could have done this a little easier with my idea, but you can only do so much.There is no tutorial and point to the game just yet. Well “point” may be the wrong word. I think maybe “reason” would be the better word. Why am I flying here? Why are there random blocks jumping up in front of me? What’s with the rings? Why would I want to continuously fly through them? Is it just for the achievements? The short answer is that stratO is a game that the developer seemed to want to create around his control scheme. Figure out the controls to the best of your abilities and enjoy trying to get all the achievements. It can actually be quite relaxing once you figure out enough of the controls to not hit things.The developer is also adding a new mode to the game named Salvo. It’s almost the same game currently but with a gun attached to your plane that automatically fires. I’m assuming that you’re just supposed shoot the blocks. This feels like an easier mode than the regular mode and can almost act as a bit of a tutorial. I’d almost recommend playing Salvo mode first. I’m sure that there will be more to this, but as it stands, it’s good enough since he’s still creating it.Score: Gewd.While there’s not much going on in stratO and you can see the developer is working on this and adding more to the game and that’s no small feat. stratO is a smooth experience and if you can get a combo going with some good flying the music rewards you and makes the experience all that much better. While I am not completely enjoy the controls, it’s not something that can’t be overcome like some other games I’ve played. It took me a bit to get completely into this game, but in the end I can say that I enjoyed my experience. I can’t say its got a lot to make you want to come back unless you’re an achievement hunter. Maybe when the Salvo mode gets fleshed out we might have something a bit more to solidify the foundation and possibly help me get the one achievement I tried hard to get: “I DO WHAT I WANT”.			"

												The premise of the game is very nice and it looks beautiful but the controls are extremely compicated and the game throws you into flight with no tutorial, no idea what to do and just leaves you alone with the over-responsive and confusing control pattern.A tutorial and/or beginners mode would go a long way to making this fun. I'm not willing to read through tutorials and try and error for hours until I ""get it"".			"

												This game is fun, but simplistic; if you're looking for loads of content, this is not the game for you. However, it is, like I said, quite fun.			"

												An awesome game with an intense sense of speed. There's a bit of a learning curve but once you understand how the game works you'll be hooked. The game is still evolving after release with updates improving on the UI and an additional game mode to be added sometime in the future.  "

First time playing:When you first get into the game you start off in black space with the plane flying.Then, some words appear which I forgot what they say, but it's nothing that actually teachesyou or tells you anything about the game. I am impatient, though, so I mashed all of the buttons (using PS3 controller).Maybe I skipped the introduction (if there is one). After that it sends you straight into the game.If you're like me and you have been watching Moatdd play the game, you came in thinking ""I got this.""But after 15 seconds of being in the game reality hits you. GameplayIT IS NOT AS EASY AS IT LOOKS! Don'tcome into the game with the mentality that you're going to pull off what Moatdd (or anybody else) is doing.The game does have a learning curve. You will not get into the game and pull off awesome stunts.You will have to put time into the game and practice. Flying the craft is a skill itself.This gives you a sense of accomplishment whenever you do manage to pull off a stunt or turbo manouver through a small tunnel. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a game you can randomly play, such as while waiting for your League of Legends queue to load. Graphics:Graphics wise, the game is really crisp. I am playing on a GTX 970 at 1920x1080 resolutionand hit an average of 150 FPS. This is all with max settings. When I first saw the game I thought ""Oh, look at all of those things! Looks flashy and awesome. Must play!""Summary:Overall this is a great game. The only negative thing is that I am having a hard time learning how to fly, but that's my own fault I guess. For sure worth the $9.99 and will recommend to friends.TL;DR Game has a hard learning curve (for me at least). You might rage quit or give up. Crisp graphics. A lot of options to fiddle with. Good game to randomly play. Would personally recommend. "

												It's a great game with a pretty big learning curve. But once you get the hang of it you're free to do as you please! Defy the laws of physics! See how good you can get! Or just have FUN! This game has a large amount of potential and is made to be pure fun. I enjoyed it. I hope you all will too! :D			"

												Strato is a unique game in which you are in control of a paper plane darting, weaving and slinding your way through obstaces in order to collect the highest possible number of rings :D.  Highly recommened this game its fun and very enjoyable but its has a skill curve, which takes a little while to master, it Will be harder for casual players to take to but after you've mastered that you'll have alot of fun playing this game.

												Excellent game, definitely recommend to anyone who wants an initial challenge with even more built in, there's a bit at the start of playing where you think you understand how to play and then you realise there are more gameplay elements, extremely fun. Not to mention the visuals and sounds, perfect, great work Mark on making an amazing game that I feel will eat up my hours!			"

												A really enjoyable physics based arcade flying game that I'd recommend to anyone looking for something unique. It's very polished despite being developed by only one person. The controls feel tight and while there is only one mode, the mechanical depth and overall level of care taken from the menus to the music, leaves me feeling like I got my moneys worth.			"

												Very fun game, you use a total of 8 keys: wasd, and ijkl to control ailerons, rudder, and pulling in the wings. with the correct combinations of these keys you can perform a wide range of moves, and after getting used to what everything does, you can do more then you can in a normal flight sim.EDIT: I have previously played this game in windows, but I tried it in linux, but it doesn't download any files, and then steam has a missing executable error (because there are non files). Is this an error in steam as it is not sending the files, or are there no files for linux? this is annoying, because it is a very good game, and as I mainly use linux I cannot play it.7/10 this game is very good in windows, but it doesn't work/download in linux			"

												I gonna be honest, the controls are a real betch to learn, but don't let that pull you away from such an amazingly fun and intense game.The feeling you get when you pull off some amazing combo is just the best, burning throught the center of a hoop at insane speed, while pulling off a stunt, while in slow mo, while giant pillars rise up and desend down all around you, while being a freaken rocket-powered glider, while a freaking choir 'ahhh's in your ears at the amazing shet your pulling off, and all while a fan-flipping-tastic soundtrack pulses through your freaking soul. All while its being freaking brillant, highly recommended. "

												The controls are a little bit wonky at first but the game is super dope. Fun to relax and vibe out to and also fun to play with friends and scream as they crash into stuff. Would recomend.			"
