												[7.7/10]The weirdest simulation games ever !Step into the rubber soled shoes of the hapless janitor tasked with cleaning up Santa's mess after a devastating battle in the santa's workshop. you have your bucket to wipe off the blood, gloves and incinerators to deal with the chunkier bits.It’s not as dumb as you’d imagine. It has that odd satisfaction of a job well done.ohh...you can even enlist some friends to come and help you clean up... or make even more mess !			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below)Game Name: Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage Original Release: 2013 Genre Tags: Simulation; Casual; Comedy; First-Person; Gore   My Overall Grade: B Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-9 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamersREVIEWViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a funny, simple game that shouldn’t be taken seriously.  It is a “simulator” style game with purposefully “silly” controls and movement.  It is the kind of game where there isn’t much to it, but it is fun while it lasts.  Expect a handful of hours of playtime.There is only one map and it is pretty small, but is actually perfectly sized.  It is designed well; big enough that you can enjoy looking around without it being too big that things get boring trying to clean.  The amount of time it takes to actually beat the campaign (read: finish cleaning everything) is just enough to be substantial without getting too tedious— 1 to 2 hours.  The game still might get a little tedious if you are going for all the achievements.For the most part, though, it is pretty damn entertaining.  As you look around at the mess that you are cleaning, you’ll notice that it tells the story of what happened.  It is very amusing. There are several little Easter eggs and such as well.It has multiplayer where you can connect directly to a friend.  The game would definitely be more fun to play with someone than alone.  I feel this is a kind of game that would have greatly benefitted from old school local multiplayer.  I feel like it would be fun to sit on a couch with your significant-lover or a buddy and play a stupid game like this.  Perhaps it will be added at a future date from when I wrote this.Ultimately, though, don’t expect too much.  You’ll get an amusing couple of hours, maybe a bit more if you bring a friend and/or unlock the achievements.  After that, you will never play it again.  Of course, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is also probably best enjoyed around the holidays, as it is extra comical when juxtaposed with all the real holiday spirit you will be exposed to in real life.Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!

Nooo... this is a game about cleaning up blood, viscera, bodyparts and other nasty stuff.... Did i get ure attention?! GOOD, now listen!""The StorySantas had enough after year after year handing out presents to little ungrateful children (Yeah im talking about YOU!), and blows a serious gasket and goes on a rampage and kills everybody in santas workshop, and vanishes without a trace.The MissionYou are a janitor hired to clean up this mess. So what are u waiting for?! Get going! Pros- You never have this much fun cleaning.- Fun to clean with ure mates (If u get it working, havent tried mp on this game)- Nice ""christmasy"" graphicsCons- Some glitches can accur with objects spazzing out.- Some achivements can be a pain to get. (There are guides though.)Personal ThoughtsId say this is the best christmas game out there that i have played.

												Just like the Shadow Warrior version this Viscera game also contains only one level but it is quite unique and overall a bit funnier than the factory or space station levels in the vanilla game.Santa has gone crazy and got rid of his elves and now it is up to you to clean up the mess! Funny how you can create an even bigger mess by not being careful and throwing dynamite into the fireplace. The flying debris results in ash everywhere and this time you also need to clean up some liquor Santa left after some heavy drinking.It is a short game but the achievements can make it last a little bit longer. It is a must for all the Viscera fans out there!			"

												First of all, this is not a long game.  It is, however, entertaining for the content it does have.  If you've ever heard the Weird Al song ""The Night Santa Went Crazy,"" this videogame explores the aftermath.  Based on the Viscera Cleanup Detail series of games, instead of being set in a typical video game world (""Space Janitors!""), this one takes place in Santa's Workshop, where you play the one elf who appears to have stayed home the night before.  The rest your fellow toymakers can be found strewn about the workshop in various pieces.  Santa's Rampage has left no survivors, (no, not even the reindeer), and it's up to you to clean up the mess.Your job here is to mop up the spills and smears of blood, pick up and dispose of any inappropriate objects and generally return the workshop to it's original state, as much as possible, given that at least one door was blown off its hinges.  Gameplay is fairly simple, though sometimes a bit wonky in the controls.  You get a mop, a ""mess detector"" and a pair of gloves.  You can also pick up buckets of water or biohazard bins to help in the cleanup.  You use the mop to wipe up the mess, then dunk the dirty mop into a clean bucket of water, cleaning the mop, but eventually dirtying the water.  Disposal of waste is handled in the most efficient manner possible: the fireplace, of course,   Care must be taken because some objects are more volatile than others, and disposing of them in the fireplace can be hazardous to your health.   But a steady hand, and lots of patience will see you through the game.It's not high entertainment by any stretch of the imagination, but for an hour or so of laughing every time you pick up a mangled elf corpse (""Fritz!  He killed Fritz!  That lousy, stinking, pot-bellied slave-driver! That despicable animal toy-monger!""), nothing beats Santa's Rampage.			"

												It's cheap, yet gives quite a refreshing experience.Basically, Santa got mad and terrorized everyone in the workshop, and you are here to clean up. The game isn't violent, it's just that it's very bloody.The whole process takes about 1.5 - 2 hrs (at least on your first try).You will have to get rid of the bodies (by burning), then wipe away the blood and get rid of all the broken stuff, then a bit of layout adjustment.You might be thinking that it is too repetitive and will become boring, but in fact it isn't like that at all.One really impressive thing is the sense of completion this game gives you. If you step on the blood you will leave footprints, that's why you are most likely to clean areas bit by bit. You really feel how the place changes around you. There is also coop in this game.I am dead serious. No joke. Give this game a try. This game itself is a short demo to their upcoming game that is set in a space station (with numerous levels to choose from). The is also another demo which features the first level of the newly released Shadow Warrior remake, but personally, i think this is a better version.Also, it costs about 2$.			"

Ho ho ho I chopped some elvesRating: OkSanta's had bad a bad day and unloaded his guns on his elves. You have to clean up the mess after he left to deliver some packages. Pretty funny game in the Viscera's series. Fun for a while but it soon gets a bit boring. As you are a lot of time in the same space and virtually nothing happens other than you wiping the floor. The handling of all the stuff is a bit cluncky so you now and then kick your own bucket and you can start over again. Like the real life of a janitor I suppose. One annoying thing to mention is that you cannot save the game so if you want to clean the whole place you better reserve some time. You also don't have an indication about your progress other than the stuff you don't see anymore. The 'real' game is still in alpha so i guess this 'by-product' shows the state of the game at the moment. Fun for a little while.			"

												 you're looking for a game review you've come to the wrong place. But if youre looking for a fantastic ravioli recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients- To Make the Dough375 grams (3 cups) plain flour1/2 teaspoon salt2 eggs1/4 cup (50 ml / 3½ tablespoons) olive oil1/2 cup (120 ml / 8 tablespoons) waterExtra flour for dusting - To Make Cheese Filling15 ounces (425 grams) container Ricotta cheese5 ounces (142 g/about 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons) ""3 Cheese Italian Blend"" (Parmesan, Romano & Asiago)Note: grate these cheeses yourself and create your own custom blend.1/2 cup cheddar cheese2 eggs, lightly beaten1/2 teaspoon salt1/2 teaspoon pepper- ExtrasYour favorite sauce for the ravioli (i.e. marinara/ marijuana)Parmesan cheeseBasilFried vegetablesShrimpFish slicesChicken pieces Make the Ravioli filling.- In a small mixing bowl, add the ricotta and mash with a fork.- Add in the 3-cheese blend, Cheddar cheese, eggs, salt, and pepper.- Mix all ingredients thoroughly until you have a smooth, paste-like consistency.- Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes. Make the Ravioli dough.- Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix.- Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed.- Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough.- Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic.- Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters.- With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles).- Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor. Fill the Ravioli shells.- Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough.- Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle.- Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well.- Repeat this process for all your dough circles.- Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together. Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.- Roll the dough into two sheets- Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups.- Fill with the ravioli mixture.- Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling.- Remove and separate the finished raviolis.Cook the Ravioli.- Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil.- Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test.- If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed platesServe it up.Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!

												I spent two hours cleaning up, only to spend another hour looking for the last christmas decoration that fell behind the bookshelf......and in the game.Viscera Cleanup Detail see's you play the role of Janitor to the gruesome aftermath of Santa's breakdown at his Workshop. You'll rush around, cleaning up what is left of his little elf helpers with the help of very wriggly mop and some high tech cleaning gizmo's.While it's not something I'll likely return to as the layout of the gruesome aftermath of Santa's rampage doesn't seem to change, the game kept me hooked cleaning up (and burning everything) I could find.I can't actually believe how well it kept my attention, because of that, I think it gets a recommendation for those type of gamers who enjoy hunting down secrets, stealing everything in sight or obsessively cleaning!

═══════════════════════════════════OVERVIEWViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a first-person janitor simulator... yes, you heard me, janitor simulator. Viscera Cleanup Detail games are pretty fun, each has their own unique story like this one; drunk Santa went on a rampage, killing elves and trashing his workshop with dynamites because he got tired of everything, this is clearly a GOTY material. Jokes aside, I had fun with this game, graphics are nice, there are a lot of easter eggs, hard and funny achievements and other cool stuff you can experiment with.═══════════════════════════════════PROS & CONSPros:Makes cleaning funAwesome graphicsCleaning mechanicsDon't want to spoil it, but there's dynamite tooCons:Too shortOnly 1 areaSome achievements are annoying to doNot suitable for children═══════════════════════════════════SUMMARY & FINAL RATINGThis game is for everyone that wants to clean take a break from shooters while still playing something violent. I rate the game 8/10, would get stuck on the tiny elf body holding a NERF gun again!═══════════════════════════════════For more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!

												As someone that hates cleaning in real life, this game is very Zen to play for some reason, possibly because I'm OCD... Unless you play with friends then it can be a damn nightmare depending if you want screw around. This fun little standalone game only contains the one map, but for the low price you can't complain. You must clean the mess after a rampaging Santa and save/ruin Christmas for everyone. There is lots of little things in this game that make it funny and allow you to piece together the tragic story together on what you think happened. Lots of little notes you can pick up and read, reading the books on the shelf, as well as just looking at how the elf corpses are scattered around the map... Or blowing up yourself and your friend with the TNT found in the map.Not really a whole lot to explain, other than look up some videos and screenshots. If it looks interesting to you then give it a try, otherwise you may not enjoy it.Pros:- Short little game.- Funny humor.- Coop- Cheap price point.- Easy achievements. (Only took me 5 hours to 100%)Cons:- Game can be a little glitchy sometimes with the physics, even more so if you play online and experience any high ping with people.- Will always be the same map, nothing changes game to game.- No Steam Cards.Good buy for the price, and enjoyable to play with friends, would recommend it!

												First time in, I threw some dynamite into the fireplace and ended up mesmerised by the fuse burning down, then I ended up all over the walls...Second time in, I ""accidentally"" threw a molotov cocktail into a room where I had been storing all the dynamite...you know, just to see what would happen...I ended up on the walls again...Third time in I think I broke the water-bucket dispenser so I ended up washing the floors and walls with elf blood which was surprisingly NOT green...Fourth time in I kinda lost track of time reading all Santa's letters...he's been a VERY bad boy!Maybe one day I'll get the whole place clean, until then I think I'll just keep trying to blow everything up...Santa/10 would have a psychotic break again			"

												After playing this game I went over to my brothers room, grabbed him by the chest, dragged him downstairs into the living room furnace. I held him as he burned and as the flesh of his guts flew over my hands, his intestine on the ground, and his lower left leg was completely scorched. I continued this event to each and everyone of my family members. They are all dead now and I am currently trying to clean up my house. This is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life. Thank you.			"

And the title doesn't lie. I found myself cleaning up.... what can I say, Santa's rampage. It's a fun game that doesn't take too long. It's a good laugh for people who want it and it has it's consistancy for people who want to actually clean up everything. I'd have to give this game a 7/10. It meets its pricetag well but it's not perfect.			"

												..I played this while watching twitch to scratch my Christmas itch (ahem)..If you like to play games as a bit of a completionist and taking your time - and seeing your progress gives you a little buzz, then this is a strangely addictive way to spend a few hours. It IS based on a game in alpha/beta status, and the devs have said basically that ""things go wrong"" in that items (mostly swords & stuff) can glitch into the floor. I had one item I couldn't reach and two more that were reached with the console command to remove 'dirty' items (supported by the devs for this exact reason). Otherwise you would have to be VERY careful during your play-through and restart if any items fell into the world, as you enter and leave your 'job' – no saving.A couple of the achievements are going to be utterly infuriating if you want to 100% it so perhaps pass it over if that's your thing until it's fixed. Yes, it's super simple. Yes it's not for everyone.. But I seriously.. really loved playing it & for less than £2 it was a good way to spend an evening, even if slightly masochistic.			"

												I played this off the back of watching a film by the name of ""Sunshine Cleaning"", it's a charming yarn about a pair of sisters played by Amy Adams and Emily Blunt. One sister (Adams) is a smart determined single mother gritting it out as a cleaner to support a slightly problematic child whilst at the same time fitting in an affair with a married man who has absolutely no respect for himself, Adams or his pregnant wife!!....the other (Blunt) is caught half way between being a dreamer and a screw up. To cut a long story short out of necessity they form a crime scene cleaning company by the name of Sunshine Cleaning, burn down a house and decimate family relationships only to build them back up again.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Revenge doesn't feature Amy Adams or Emily Blunt, it doesn't even feature Alan Arkin as a slightly potty father selling popcorn out of the back of a sedan one week then struggling to shift seafood lovingly preserved in his bathtub the next....it did however teach me one thing, which is that this crime scene cleaning lark isn't for me.Upon entering the grotto the game advise's me that Santa has had a break down and went ballistic with a shotgun. Elves are scattered everywhere, limbs are scattered everywhere, the walls and carpets are painted red. I spent 20 minutes walking around in circles following bloody footprints only to realise that they were my own as I'd stepped on an Elve's head when entering the grotto....this is a far cry from getting the hoover out on a Sunday afternoon and following it up with some light dusting and a few sprays of anti-bac surface cleaner. Every few mop strokes im having to ring it out in the water bucket, every few minutes im forced to freshen up the water in the bucket, it's feels like a job and for that the developers deserve massive praise.""Sunshine Cleaning"" 8/10 - Amy Adams shines in a touching drama about love, life & family.

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a cleaning simulator that has you going around and cleaning the aftermath of Santa's descent into elf murdering madness. How much destruction can a jolly old man cause you may be wondering? Well to put it lightly Santa put quite a bit of his free time into knife throwing lessons and has adorned the walls with bloody elf corpses. Limbs are everywhere, the rooms are smeared with blood and Santa even had to nerve to hide a few bodies as to avoid being charged with 100 murders because anything more than 99 is just barbaric. A nice little detail is that searching Santa's office will fill you in as to why he went postal and feel a bit sympathetic for the fat man until you realize that you stepped on some blood and created footprints all the way from the hall. It was around this point that I remembered I was a janitor, not a detective so I went on my merry way to get a bucket of water from this rather odd machine built solely to dispense buckets of water. Back into the room I go, I set down the bucket and turn back only to see a new set of footprints have been made on my way over here.I clean and I clean until my mop starts making more of a bloody mess instead of cleaning any of it and I try to clean my mop in the bucket. As it turns out you have to be at just the right place to dunk it in water but foolish old me just started trying different buttons and ended up smacking the bucket right into Santa's desk and knocking over his whiskey bottles straight to the floor. So out I go to get another bucket of water and the machine plops out a raw hunk of bloody meat dirtying up the area even more. It is at this point that I slowly nod to myself, go back into Santa's office and threw a stack of TNT into the fireplace out of spite. I then left the job site and into the night as I started to realize this wasn't too bright. As you can imagine my boss was more than displeased and this good ole janitor was fired on Christmas Eve. Er, poor Christmas rhymes aside this is one title where you will want to pay attention as the slightest slip up can make the room messy again. As this game also features online coop this will be the perfect title to either work as a team or get them to hate you and your clumsiness.Cleaning is a very time consuming process in this game. Your mop gets dirty and so does the bucket eventually, making you walk all the way back to get another one. Corpses are your biggest concerns as whenever you pick them up and accidentally bump them into something, blood splatters onto the surface of the area. The elves never run out of blood oddly enough so there is no limit to the amount of mess a single corpse can create. At first I simply stuck them into containers but they quickly all filled to the brim. I eyed the fireplace and as it turns out you are actually supposed to cremate them in there. It's not just the corpses and blood you must clean. You are supposed to burn everything from corpses, antlers, whiskey bottles and Santa's guns. If the cheery Christmas melodies start getting on your nerves you can simply toss the jukebox into the fire as well. Even the buckets with the bloody water must be burned. Everything must be burned and the fireplace can be quite some ways from where the mess is so you can stuff them into your giant storage box and carry them back. It would be far easier to simply burn the house down but oh well, that's the life of an underpaid janitor I suppose.As you can no doubt tell by now this game is rather morbid and filled with dark humor. You don't even have to work if you don't want to, you can just toss elf corpse onto the table like if this was a wrestling game. Toss bottles, paint the room red with your bloody mop and stacking all the bodies near the entrance so however enters has one heck of a surprise are some of the things you can have fun with if you are not a cleaning kind of person. There is no price or anything other than achievements for cleaning so there is no real point for doing so unless you are really dedicated to your role of janitor. Only one map to explore and nothing to unlock so what you see is what you get. If you are taking the game seriously and are actually cleaning it should take you a bit over 2 hours to fully clean it if you are by yourself. It is quite a graphic intensive game due to all the objects that you can manipulate and looks pretty good as well however it is a fairly small map. All in all it is a rather enjoyable cleaning game with enough freedom to be able to easily get some decent entertainment for the price. It's not a game I find all to enjoyable personally but if you are in the market for a cleaning game based on the great elf massacre that drove Santa into being a dangerous fugitive then this is the game for you!

												Top fun game. What makes this game even better is that it has coop so you can do it with friends. There are many nice little features within the game, like TNT, molotovs and yes these do blow up. Knives you throw at friends etc. There's are many little things in the game that makes it amazing. The audio is pretty simple with squash squash, bam bam sounds when using wet mops, buckets etc.The controls are really simple, literally really simple and you cannot complain.The mechanics of the game are even simpler... Tidy and use your head about it.  You do not use a bloody bucket to clean a floor do you.... It makes more mess.The coop really sets the game apart... Cleaning together and accidently knocking your friends bucket which is full of blood and whatever making it all messy and more mess, shooting at each other etc, top funIt is stupid cheap which is a perfect buy. I brought this and then brought the official game in space station for $7 and got a free key of this game so I would say go to the website and preorder the official space station version and you get a steam key for both this game and the one coming out. The graphics are actually pretty decent which surprised me. Worth a buy and play.			"

												This game is so amazing that I couldn't think of what I would be doing around Christmas every year, it's been there for me when I have been extremely bored, and this game is not the usual type I'd play. It's a physics interactivity type game, you're cleaning up after Santa's rampage, where all of the elves are dead. It's a huge mess, so it's going to require a lot of time to clean. Not only that, but they still release really awesome updates, 3 years later after its release, and I'm loving all the new features they've been working on.What makes this game all the more amazing, is that the creator(s) haven't left this game yet, they still put love and time into it, and that's pretty much why I enjoy playing it every year, like I don't remember how all the last times went.If you like a game where your job is to clean an entire building, then this game is for you!

This one will take a bit longer to complete than the others, but its really fun to play and rewarding to see everything all nice and clean.   Oh, and multiplayer is fun too because of how things can go so smooth and fast, or be super messy and take forever to clean.			"

												Now this is bizarre. Instead of being the hellraiser, you're the cleaner. In this game, you clean up messes. Yeah.This is the third Viscera Cleanup Detail. There's the Shadow Warrior one, which came with the base game. You clean up the bodies Lo Wang left behind. Then there's the original Viscera Cleanup Detail, where you clean up the mess a generic space marine left behind when he was having all the fun. Now, you're cleaning up a mess Santa made. The mess where he murdered all of his elves.The gameplay is simple enough. You get a mop, and a blood detector. Your goal is to clean up the blood, and get rid of all harmful items. A water bucket and a disposal bin are also included in your arsenal of cleanliness. You need to dispose of the dead bodies, shattered whiskey bottles, and so on. The only real hazards in this game are the TNT around that can blow up, and the fact that you can make more blood with footsteps and your dirty mop, which needs frequent cleaning. It's simple, but hey, the game's cheap, and is always being updated. It's a clever idea, executed very well. It definitely won't cater to everyone's tastes, but it is a fun time waster. If you like to clean, you're gonna have a field day with this one.			"

												This is one of those odd games you just wouldn't expect to be any good (a game about cleaning, seriouslely?), yet somehow it turns out to be strangely relaxing. Little Inferno was the same. If you're keen, I'd suggest pre-ordering the main game which will give you this one as well.If you aren't sure if it's your kind of game, go buy the Shadow Warrior reboot - not only is that one of the best games of the year and one of the best shooters/swordplay games of all time, you also get a free copy of the Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior spin-off which will give you an idea of what this game is all about.

												The paper-thin premise for this game is that you are a janitor whose job it is to clean up the mess Santa Claus made after he went postal at the North Pole. That's about it for story and background, but if you're interested in this title, you're not here for the in-depth plot and character development (which is good, because there is none).You arrive in Santa's workshop and you see the entire place is a huge mess. There are body parts (of both elves and the reindeer, including Rudolph) strewn all over the area. There's copious amounts of blood and other chunky pieces of meat in various places, sometimes even in areas you wouldn't normally expect.A lot of detail has gone into the environment, including a hole blasted through a wall (complete with scorch marks) and numerous items, ranging from chairs to presents to toy guns (which the elves apparently used to ""defend"" themselves against Santa) that you can interact with. Just about everything can be manipulated through the game's physics engine, so while it can be neat to see how one item can affect another, it can also lead to awkward positioning. For instance, there are bio-hazard boxes you can use, but it's often a real chore to get the elves' broken, twisted, and sometimes dismembered bodies into them. What usually ends up happening is you'll see an elf's head or leg clip through the side of the box, which will then sometimes lead to the box jumping around by itself. Basically, it's the same old problem ragdoll physics have always had when bumping up against an object.Now... onto the cleaning. Your mop can clean up blood, but in the process it gets blood-soaked. After a while your mop will start spreading and smearing blood. When this happens, you can grab a bucket of water and rinse the mop. It'll be clean again and available to wipe away various bloody bits. However, each time you rinse the mop, the water in the bucket gets bloodier and bloodier. Eventually the bucket will be so bloody (and this is readily apparent) that dipping your mop in there will only serve to get more blood on it. Fortunately, you can get an unlimited number of buckets of clean water from a machine in Santa's workshop, although sometimes that same machine spits out a torn off leg or an unidentifiable chunk of flesh.To keep people interested long after the novelty of wiping away blood has grown stale, the developer put in a bunch of achievements to gain. Most of these are fairly easy to acquire, but a few can be difficult and time consuming.There is no way to save your game, so although you can ""clock out"" near the workshop's entrance, you won't return to the point you last left off. This isn't a huge deal, but if you've gone through the effort of meticulously cleaning Santa's workshop, you'll want to take some screenshots as it'll be a mess again when you return.I should note that ""Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage"" is actually a variant of a free game (technically an alpha), created by the same developer (RuneStorm), simply entitled ""Viscera Cleanup Detail."" Everything is the same in the free version except the setting, which is on a space station, and a lack of achievements. Something the free version has that Santa's Rampage doesn't, however, is the opportunity for online multiplayer gameplay. Whether or not this will be added to Santa's Rampage is anyone's guess. Viscera Cleanup Detail is only free right now because it's an alpha. It will cost at some point in the future, and if you pre-order it, you'll automatically get a Steam key for it, plus Steam keys for Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior and Santa's Rampage. The URL is here: http://www.runestorm.com/viscera So would I recommend Santa's Rampage? Yes, provided you get it on sale (I paid about two bucks) or you get it by pre-ordering the regular Viscera Cleanup Detail. There's not much of a game here, but it's a fun activity if you've got too much time to wait around, but not enough to engage in a longer, more detailed title.			"

The Main PlotVarious notes and letters can be found in the workshop and office, implying that prior to the player's role in Santa's Rampage, Santa Claus had been under large amounts of stress from unpaid bills, outrageous requests from children, elf union strikes, and even threats. Santa subsequently snapped under the pressure, purchasing several crates of 12-gauge shotgun rounds, steak knives, and dynamite sticks, and fashioning several makeshift molotov cocktails (likely under the influence of alcohol). Santa then went on a murder spree, mutilating several elves and reindeer, and destroyed parts of his workshop in the process. He left the scene through unknown means.After these events, the company ""Polar Sanitation Co."" employed the player and sent them to clean the workshop, where the player's role in Santa's Rampage begins.For the ending of my review i can say that the developers did not do the normal online game, where each can play with friends or just a stranger who finds your game. My mark is 8/10. "

												After a grueling 5-6 hours, I, along with my four other men, had finally cleaned the horrible mess. After a long determinated clean filled with pep talks and buckets galore, we had emerged victorious; covered in sweat and blood, a triumphant sigh had escaped our lips. Never again will we come near this place, this place of horror, but when we look back at our achievement, we will certainly know that we were the true gamers, the true cleaners, the true ocd freaks. This game is the truest of true bonding experience and test of friendship. However from a minor glitch of the blood that prevents gaining all achievemnents. This game is well worth the price.

												Great game! It satisfies my OCD needs, except when small things such as candles and ornaments fall through the floor or go behind something so that you can't reach it. But what can i say because it was super cheap! My main request is some sort of save system so your time doesnt have to be wasted			"

												Funny short game where you need to clean stuff at Santa's workshop. A pretty unique game since the main focus is about cleaning heh. If you like to play around with physics you will have a lot of fun with it. The level is pretty small, but very detailed and gory. Well, I guess the gory part is what makes this game so entertaining :)			"

												Nothing get's me in the Christmas spirit more than burning elf limbs.In all seriousness Santa's Rampage is a wonderful little game. The amount of laugh's and shocks I had for 2 bucks makes this game well worth the almost absurdly small pricetag. I highly reccommend this little gem.Heres my gameplay if you want a laugh

 Summarized Review Viscera Cleanup Detail is a great game.I Recommend this game.9/10 Full Review Just by watching the trailer, you know what you're getting yourself into.You're cleaning up dead elven entrails, nuf said.As a game made on the Unreal engine, the game itself is amazing.The graphics are better than those in skyrim, and the same thing goes for the ingame physics.On your own, this should take you about three hours to completely clean (give or take ten minutes cleaning up every time a dismembered body part flops out of your bucket dispenser).About half of the three hours you spend cleaning will be spent on stacking buckets to create a horribly engineered ladderto the clean the blood and smashed christmas ornaments off the roof.You will spend one hour cleaning blood and burning bodies, then the last half-hour trying to find a small chunk of elf flesh that has fallen behind santa's desk.If you play with friends however, this job should take just a fraction of the time you did it on your own. right?Wrong.While you try to clean, one or more of your friends will make a bigger mess by using Santa's TNT to blow you and himself up. I'm looking at you bob..That ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gery aside. I rate this game 9/10 "

												I love the concept of the game and I love the graphics. This game had it all to be pure gold, but unfortunately I cannot recommend this at the present time. The amount and severity of bugs make the game not enjoyable at all. Invisible dirt spots, objects getting stuck in corners or under the floor, movement glitches, janitor's box glitching in several and disastrous ways, fireplace not destroying some items no matter how long they're kept in (had to re-insert them to make it work), items going trough the buckets and disposable bins, itens flying violently all over the place when a laid down bin is put in the right position... I could also list some refinements that make gameplay better, but these glitches and bugs are way more important, and they're not being addressed so a list of improvements is unnecessary. Conclusion: Do not buy it no matter how cheap you find it.			"

												This game is both soothing and amazingly enraging at the same time. There is something calming about cleaning up the destruction of others, but as soon as you accidentally bump an elf head into the freshly cleaned wall which results in even more splattered blood, then you start seeing red (no pun intended). I wanted to go on a murderous rampage myself after finding out, no, leaving the game through the pause menu instead of the check out computer doesn't actually save the game. If you need to go out and get something while playing this, just leave the game running and hope it doesn't crash (it did, the second time I tried cleaning - so much rage). Hours. Hours of careful, meticulous cleaning and hoarding of elf heads wasted without even praise. It was ♥♥♥♥ing bull♥♥♥♥♥♥But still. This game is awesome and exactly what I needed after the festive season. Play this if you want to know what it feels like to have your meds fail on you.			"

Game is completly flawless.Now for something a little more in depth.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's RampageSanta's Rampage is a standalone of the full Viscera Cleanup Deatail. In this version you head up to the North Pole and visit Santa's Workshop. Santa has put up with his Elves long enough and has gone postal with his knives and boomstick. You gain entrance to Santa's Workshop just to be greeted with the festering corpses of Elves as well as his Reindeer. It is your job as the janitor to clean up this mess and decided the fate of Christmas. With mop in hand you go on a gut wrenching cleaning frenzy, mopping up Elf guts to properly disposing of expolsives (or not). I really had a blast collecting various toys and stacking stools (Harder than you may think) to get the 13 achivements this game has to offer. Viscera Cleanup also offers a local or online co-op mode so you can even mop with your friends. If you have an extra few dollars in your Steam Wallet I say go ahead and pick this up and give it a go, it's a good time passer.10/10 Would collect decapited Elf heads and take them back to the office again.Feel free to message me if you have questions about the review/gameThanks for reading,MonkeyWrench			"

												Great game i'd say, if you like weird games then this is for you. If you're playing with a friend its just so fun, I mean, cleaning blood and blowing Santa's grotto up? How fun is that!? And for the cost of only £1.798/10- Fun to play multiplayer.- Entertaining to blow stuff up.If you have any spare money, you should totally check this out.			"

												From watching the video on the page of this game, you think ""Wow what a stupid game who could stick to this?"" and oddly enough after buying this game you become strangely addicted to it. I've spent a few hours just playing it different ways to find better, more efficient ways to clean everything up. Quite frankly, I love it.			"

												This was a very intresting game for me. Most of the games realeased now-adays are you enter a room, kill everyone, and leave. But this game brings a new perspective to that. Instead it places you in the position of someone who has to CLEAN up that bloody room. When you first start playing it seems like it has little promise for fun. But then it kinda grows on you that its actuallly a very ""Intressting"" and fun game. There's no thrill of combat, but there is enjoyment. And for $2.00 you can't really go wrong. If you think it looks compelling to you, then GO FOR IT, it is a very, again ""Intressting"" experience.			"

												Ever wonder who has to clean up the blood and gibs after each level of your favorite FPS game? It's the janitor, the sanitation engineer, the industrial hygenist, and you get to step into his shoes to do just that in Viscera Cleanup Detail. The developor, RuneStorm, is working on the main game but has released this (Santa's Rampage) and Shadow Warrior mini-game versions ahead of it. Work with a mop, your hands, and a sniffer (stain and junk detector tool) and clean up the mess that, in this case, the jolly bearded guy made after drinking one too many Slack Spaniel Whiskey and Hurlington Eggnog concoctions. Watch out for the various weapons of mass destruction he left unused in his wake though.This Santa version and the Shadow Warrior version comes 'free' if you pre-purchase their main game on their website. If you purchase Shadow Warrior you get the SW version. Personally I recommend the Shadow Warrior version because it's a lot more polished and less buggy.This game is worth getting even if you later pre-order their unfinished game. Currently at least, you can always give the Steam key to your friend (it's through Humble's store). Just be prepared for the bugs.			"

It lacks some polish and bug-fixing (items can glitch through the floor), but is still a fun game... if you consider cleaning up blood, gore, dead bodies, and miscellaneous things after Santa's murderous drunken rampage fun!

												So I heard about this game from a Youtuber. I looked fun and entertaining. Clean up the mess of what Santa has done to his workers. Sound cool, right...? YES! This is a super fun game that would not sound so cool on paper, cleaning up santa's workshop, not that fun sounding. But as a game this is something worth cheaking out. at 2.50 you can't go wrong with this. But if you want to see I you might like this game or not you can go to the website and download the alpha version of the full game. for me I kinda like this one better maybe cause it's not as big as the full one so less time to spend cleaning.  I realy like this game I recomend you check it out. You might not put to much time into it playing it solo but you can alway try multiplayer.			"

The developor, RuneStorm, is working on the main game but has released this (Santa's Rampage) and Shadow Warrior mini-game versions ahead of it. Work with a mop, your hands, and a sniffer (stain and junk detector tool) and clean up the mess that, in this case, the jolly bearded guy made after drinking one too many Slack Spaniel Whiskey and Hurlington Eggnog concoctions. Watch out for the various weapons of mass destruction he left unused in his wake though.This Santa version and the Shadow Warrior version comes 'free' if you pre-purchase their main game on their website. If you purchase Shadow Warrior you get the SW version. Personally I recommend the Shadow Warrior version because it's a lot more polished and less buggy.This game is worth getting even if you later pre-order their unfinished game. Currently at least, you can always give the Steam key to your friend (it's through Humble's store). Just be prepared for the bugs.			"

												This game is quite fun, and a decent way to pass time when you're bored. Not the most interesting game seeing how you only clean/ make a mess, and there is only one map in this game, but it is not bad. I enjoyed this game and it is worth your money and since it is only two dollars, it is a very good buy.			"

The cool thing is, is the multiplayer feature, so you can clean with your friends!!! Great game, never stops being fun.			"

If you have full blown OCD, this game will cure you BECAUSE THERE'S NO ♥♥♥♥ING WAY TO GET IT PERFECT!!!I've been cleaning up santas workshop for what seemed to be hours. Finally i got the place all clean with the exception of biohazard bins everywhere. I felt like my job had been complete, so i go to clock out and wouldn't you know it, one of the biohazard bins flips out and decides to fly around the whole work shop getting everything all bloody again. In short I clocked out and quit, never to play this game again. P.S: I now have full blown OCD. 11/10 Would play again to cure my OCD			"

Fun, Festive & FrustratingViscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is not a DLC it’s a standalone festive version of the main game Viscera Cleanup Detail. It costs $2.49 and consists of 1 level (The Santa level). I played it with 1 other and the level is unique and a lot of the details allow you to build your own story as to what happened here. It's a 2 hour map for new players, took me 1.5 to clean it perfectly and 2.5 to clear EVERYTHING. There are 13 achievements that require you to beat the level at least 2-3 times in different ways which can take between 1 - 2.5 hours. I got 100% on the 10 hour mark so there is a fair bit of gameplay and challenge to be had but it becomes quite a grind and I was glad when it was all over. 6/10- Festive theme, Achievements are a grind but worth a play for any Viscera Cleanup Detail fan "

												Viscara Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage was a little laggy at the start but it was worth it. At the the price of about $3 the game has suprisingly good quality and graphics for something that inexpensive. However it does take a long time to pick up   but is more fun and helpful when playing with friends on Steam that also have the game. There is lots of small details on the map that are interesting to find and some you get achievements for finding. The only problems I had with the game was the length of time the game took to complete and how sometimes the clock off button did not work. Overall I do reccomend this game and hope you enjoy it aswell!			"

												It is pretty fun, pretty cheap, and very replayable. Maybe just a teensy bit disturbing at first. The cons- It has some glitches that you can work around with commands. Also, it doesn't have a save feature as of yet so you need to have a block of time free to play or leave it running if you have interuptions.  The inability to save would be my biggest complaint.The pros- burning everything. Smashing ornaments. Blowing yourself up. Shaking dead elves after a rough day. Seeing how dirty you can make it or how clean.  While I haven't tried playing with others yet I think that it would be pretty fun.  Playing by yourself takes a pretty long time for a complete clean up.			"

												My experience with this game:Was having a jolly time cleaning. I had almost cleared out Santa's office where I accidentally dropped a Molotov i was putting in a crate (Apparently they don't need fire to activate.) I hadn't gotten rid of the TNT in the room yet so when the molotov broke... everything went to♥♥♥♥♥♥ I ran for my life but I din't get far enough. The Explosion killed me, sent my body parts flying, and made a mess in some hard to reach places. After recovering from a minor rage attack (mostly consisting of the ♥♥♥♥ word and manly sobbing) I decide to clean it up. After going through two buckets the machine decides to give me 4 limbs in a row and then one bucket later some lit TNT. I managed to through that ♥♥♥♥er into then uncleaned area, but the shrapnel still reached where i had already cleaned. I then gave up after I couldnt pick up a candy cane that was glitched behind a table...10/10 Best 1st Person Mopper I Have Ever Played			"

												It's what you think it is.  You pick up body parts and throw them in a fire, then you mop up the blood from the area, then you go rinse out your mop because now it's all bloody.  Over and over, this is what you do.It's not a good game, but it's not bad either.  The core mechanics aren't hard--you pick up body parts, and clean up blood.  Sometimes you dispose of weapons or broken furniture.But there's a challenge to doing things optimally.  Do you bring a bucket to a spill or just clean up the spill and then come back to your bucket?  You can drop body parts or walk through pools of blood creating more mess that you're just going to have to clean up.  So it pays to be vigilant.There's some humor, especially in the areas that you're set to clean.  It's a lot about exploration (finding corpses in weird places under floorboards, on tops of bookshelves, with knives through their chest and pinned to a wall).  The areas would be less fun to clean a second time, but then there's achievements such as collecting all the money in a level or leaving it spotless (a hard task to accomplish).At the end of the day you'll really just doing something mindless and repetitious, and if it were hard it wouldn't be fun at all.  But the absurdity of the task, and the ease of it and the sense that you're getting something done keeps you going.			"

It does get frustrating after a while when you keep having to redo parts, but that's also part of the fun so suck it up princess. The best part is the gore - seriously, the cartoony gore.

												I have OCD.  Not really, REALLY bad OCD, but enough that I have little mini-rituals of shaking door handles and checking every window, etc etc, before I go out or go to bed.  And even I can't imagine what kind of OCD-riddled LUNATIC would actually be able to get the achievement in this game which involves cleaning each and every inch of Santa's heavily-soiled workshop.  That's not to say it's that big a gaming area...an ""open-world"" game this sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥ain't, even if it is a tad sandbox-y (read: no story) for my usual tastes.  Santa's workshop is literally a handful of rooms, but man...the effort it takes to clean up even a couple of bodies and a few pools of blood...you gotta be a freakin' SAINT to have that kinda patience, let me tell ya.  Hell, it took me a few unsuccessful attempts before I was even able to plunge my blood-soaked mop into a bucket of water without spilling said bucket and having to go get a new one.  A SAINT, I tell you.  Me, I quickly gave up on such a monumental, pedantic task and set to making more of a mess and blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up.  At least that was vaguely ""fun"".   Look, it's a cute little (emphasis on ""little"", as in short, and relatively marginal) gimmick game, with an amusing and original premise (based, of all things, on a Weird Al Yankovic song - ""The Night Santa Went Crazy"" - or am I just making presumptions here?) which could surely never have been stretched beyond a few hours' worth of gameplay.  A quick glimpse at the screenshots and brief read of the marketing description, and if it sounds like ""you"", then what's a couple of bucks?  Me, I'll probably just play long enough to get a couple more achievements - the easy ones, not the one I mentioned above - then I guess maybe I'll dig it out for a half-hour every second or third December as a brief antidote to all that unbearably fake ""Christmas cheer"", before I inevitably tire of its limitations and muster up the will to play something more rewarding.     Consider this a RESERVED recommendation at best.  It's no masterpiece, not even for a ""gimmick"" game - see Little Inferno if you want an example of a game which is so very much more than it has any right to be - but it's distracting enough, for however brief a spell.  In better hands it could have admittedly been better, but really, with a title like that...what are you expecting?  Keep your expectations low, and you'll be fine.  The worse that can happen is you'll feel cheated and decide you wasted a couple of bucks and hate Christmas EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING MORE.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  If there's one thing this world needs, it's more Scrooges.  ♥♥♥♥ XMAS.Verdict: 6/10.			"

												It’s very hard to recommend this game, while it starts out as being fun it quickly turns into a chore to play. You may make it to the end and give yourself a well-earned pat on the back however when the time comes to clock out you might find that all the hours you just spent cleaning has been a big waste of time.Items such as buckets fall under the map making it impossible to finish the game, I found sometimes when tnt came out of the wash-o-matic I was unable to pick it up straight away leading to more frustration.Even though I was averaging 90fps I found the game extremely nauseous inducing even with the settings turned right down, this was only made worse with more blood, buckets and waste bins that were introduced into the game.Now that I have finished the game I don’t think I will ever play it again, kind of a one time play type of game only made worse by not being able to save progress.5/10			"

												(The game was provided by Zaraki Snakenoman.  Thanks, man.)A decent experience on Steam, a janitorial simulator.  Choose to make it cleaner, dirtier, or....emptier than when you started.   Great for those who have an obsessive urge to clean up messes...or just to burn stuff.  Although the experience is decent, the replayability for it is limited unless cleaning/burning/messes are habits you'd like to satisfy.  Though, some of it can be more rewarding in real life than in the game.My complaint, however, is that there are some areas that your sniffer (a radar that picks up grime and clutter, only it works on a hot/cold system rather than a radar) reacts to, yet when you try everything, the invisible mess is still there.Definitely not worth full price.  Get it while it's on sale if you're interested in it.6/10			"

												The Night Santa Went Crazy by ""Weird Al"" YankovicListen to that song and you have an idea of what the theme of this game is.Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage is a ""mini"" game of Viscera Cleanup Detail (Pre-orders of Viscera Cleanup Detail will also get this game on steam).The game is in all of it's simplicity a cleaning simulator where you are a janitor tasked with cleaning up after a fire fight / massacre.I found this to be quite fun.The has multiplayer (at the time of writing in beta) so you can team up with friends to do some cleaning.

												Its a really great game idea! The map is very small, not much options what you can do and still you can have hours of fun. Currently its on sale but even for 2,49 Euro you cant do much wrong. It requires just one skill, that only few can really master: Patience. If you want to clean the entire room, you should play it in MP. But that requires another hardcore skill: Perfect Teamplay. Otherwise your team will probably make the chaos even worse. :)			"

												I don't know about the actual ""space station"" full game, but Santa's Rampage is tremendous fun to play provided you're not put off by the macabre subject theme. Probably one of the most interesting aspects of this game is its ability to take something as disturbing as cleaning up dismembered elves and gore and makes you view it as a janitor would - as a job. Very quickly, you will stop perceiving the scene as a horrible, bloody murder and instead think about it in terms of how many buckets of water you need, what you can fit in a bio hazard box, where you need to stand so you don't track blood on the floor you just cleaned and so on. For such a simple basic concept, Santa's Rampage is very entertaining.It is, however, held back by niggling problems. There's no tutorial of any kind, for one, so you're left to guess at what any of the tools do. This is especially problematic with the ""sniffer"" which finds... Blood and ""broken thing"" I think, but I've no real idea what it racks or how it works. You're never given an explicit objective other than a very general order to clean the place up, but you can never be too sure what you're supposed to destroy, what you're supposed to keep or what anything does. Worst is the fact that success requires the cleaning of ALL stains, which can sometimes be so faint as to be invisible or in inaccessible places (the high ceiling) or behind objects. I've yet to succeed at this, and I can't figure out why for the life of me.In the end, though - for the price that the game asks, this is WELL worth buying. I would heartily recommend it. Unless you're squeamish.			"

												I love how these games are so strangely addicting I love the series.What you are doing:Mopping up bloodBurning or shredding bodies/body parts, trash, bins. buckets and pretty much anything you can touchDestroying evidence You are basically responsible for covering up for murders.It seems like a boring concept in some areas because you are just a janitor, but although it is time consuming when I play and look back at the clock I realize I ended up playing for hours it's very strange and a great pass time game. The Auto saves don't always work right but you can manually save using the esc key to get to the menu.			"

												This review is basically in the middle of yes and no. The game is pretty fun but there is not much to do and it becomes boring super fast. The graphics are good the controls are also good but unless your the type of person that goes achievement hunting in a game there is no way you will play more then a hour of this game. The problem I have with this game is that there are 3 different Viscera cleanup games. This one, a space station one, and some sort of dlc i believe. If all 3 of the games I just listed were different levels in one the game would be more enjoyable. If your going to get this game make sure it's on sale			"

												If you enjoy staying late to clean something up by yourself in silence, this is a fine distraction for a few hours.  It's very entertaining busy work at first, and you can get a bit carried away trying to dispose of all the gore.  But a few hours in and every new spill or hastily roasted grenade makes you groan, and you realize being trapped in a 3 room house, being told you haven't burned every last bullet or shard of glass, is less a game and more a slavery simulator.I had to exit and uninstall just to feel like I could breathe again.

But the stuff you can do besides cleaning is hilarious. I would have paid full price for this if I had known of its existence before. I loled so hard at every stupid thing I came up with and I told my friend to buy it, massive lols. Just go get it and play it with your best friend to know what I'm talking about.  The moment I tried to do things right the game sent me a TNT instead of a bucket and BOOM I was all over the floor... 10/10 would clean again.			"

												Like all the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I heartily recommend this! These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong. This edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.I have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!The gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.  The black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats. A few letters are fine but after a while they all sound the same.The physics can get wonky still in a few places but this level still shows the level of polish that Runestorm is trying to create with their small team. Who knew that Santa going on an alcohol-fueled rampage could lead to one of the best Christmas releases ever? So what are you waiting for? Strap on your candy striped rubber gloves, grab your mop and get ready to save Christmas!			"

												Se você jogou o Viscera Cleanup Detail e gostou, nem sei porque você tá lendo isso, compra de uma vez, jumento, digo, caro leitor(a) !  Mas se você é como eu, que conhecia pouco do jogo, então vê a armadilha de satanás: ""Olha, uma Summer/Winter Sale, vou comprar aquele joguinho lá"", vamos esclarecer alguns pontos: *Se você fica put..sso com facilidade, este jogo vai fazer você jogar seu notebook/pc/polistation contra a parede e ir ao mais fundo grau de loucura lovecraftiana. Cada balde caindo no chão era um soco na mesa.* Se você não pode com sangue ou gore, você não devia estar nem aqui, queridx!*Se você tem algum apreço à física, Vai chorar sangue.* Se você está acostumadx apenas a rpgs, fps e diabo a quatro, melhor continuar em Roma, César. * Se você não faz a menor ideia de como jogar essa joça, busque um gameplay ou um guia antes.* Se você não gosta de jogos repetitivos, nada pra ver aqui, circulando!* Se a sua vida não é uma profunda espiral de vazio e desespero, onde a simulação da morte é um consolo até a derradeira hora, melhor jogar Skyrim ou outro ralo de tempo. MAS.... SE VOCÊ NÃO SE IDENTIFICA COM NENHUM DOS QUESITOS ACIMA,  VAI QUE É TUA TARAFAEEEELLLL!!!, sério, se a premissa insana e a jogabilidade mais insana ainda te atrairam, eu sou apenas um grãozinho furioso de areia no meio do deserto da SteamNota: Eu não conhecia o jogo, a não ser pelo trailer e algumas imagens, estava por R$ 1,99 na Summer Sale, só comprei para dar uma arredondada na conta. Falo como jogadora de primeira viagem, entendam isto. If you played Viscera Cleanup Detail and liked, I don't know why are you reading this, buy it right away, d.mb.ss!, i mean, dear reader. But if you were like me who knew a little 'bout the game, then see the Devil's trap "" Hey, look a Summer/Winter sale, I'm gonna buy that game! Let's straight the records first:*If you get mad easily, this game gonna make you throw your laptop/pc/whatever against the wall and get down in the deepest level of lovecraftian madness. Each falling bucket was a punch in the table.*If you're weak for blood and gore, you shouldn't be here at first time.*If you like/care 'bout physic, you're going to cry blood tears.*If you're used to Rpgs/Fps and stuff, Stay in Rome, Caeser!*If you don't have a single ideia how play this thing, look for a gameplay/guide before buying it.*If you don't like repetitive games, nothing to see here!*If you life isn't a deep spiral of emptyness and desespair, where the simulation of death is a pacifier until the very last hours, better play Skyrim or another time drain.BUT.... IF YOU DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH NONE OF THE REASONS MENTIONED BEFORE, GET DOWN IN THE SICKNESS, BOYS AND GIRLS ! (In the Br Portuguese review, the joke is better but impossible to translate decently), Seriously,  if the insane propose and gameplay really caught your eye and your heart, I'm just a furious grain of sand in the Steam desert.P.S: I didn't knew the game, only by the trailer ans some pics, it was R$ 1,99 (Not going to convert it in dollars, #uckers), just bought it to not pay a broken number bill, I speak as a newbie player, so have compreehension. P.S II = Estava barato... barato demais. So cheap for a reason...			"

												I could not get multiplayer to work, which is a shame since this game is the equivalent of pulling teeth to play by yourself. Maybe it's Windows 8, maybe it's because the multiplayer is in beta. People on YouTube don't seem to be having any issues, I guess they're just lucky. Overall, it's a fun game.. It would be even more fun to play with a friend. If only ;( .			"

												Like all the Viscera Cleanup Detail games, I heartily recommend this! These guys just keep pumping out original content while polishing the main game for release. I thought this was a gag when my friends first told me about it and I'm glad I was wrong. This edition was a treat. Viscera Cleanup Detail is all about you trying to clean up someone else's mess after everything gets bloody and blown up. This time, you're going to the North Pole. Santa's workshop is a colorful wonderland and your in game radio's Christmas tunes do a good job of keeping your spirits up as you dispose of dynamite, knives, and tons of elf bodies. Oh, and lots of empty whiskey bottles.I have to touch on the cons though, before I can say what else I love about this game. Dynamite is ihe bane of this particular iteration. When Santa went crazy, he went dynamite happy. Careless handling of dynamite can toss messes way out of the reach of your mop, leading to lots of profanity and frustrations and rendering a full cleanup almost impossible. Given that the bucket machine now tosses live dynamite at you on occasion, it just feels like the devs are being unfair to the players. Of all the messes the space janitor has had to clean up, this may be the hardest. And while the warm mood lighting makes this game's setting pop with color, it also has the unfortunate side effect of making some of the lightest blood stains super hard to see, especially against the wood grains. Hopefully this might be corrected in a future version of the game, but at least your trusty sniffer still works well for finding the lost messes. Back to the pros!The gameplay VCD is known for is still here, and, like they did in the Shadow Warrior level, there are side objectives you can do as well for Steam achievements, namely tracking down all of the toy guns and officially licensed Rooks Keep action figures for your trunk. When you clock out, the punchout machine lists what souvenirs you dropped into your trunk. There are also numerous achievements for how well you cleaned. Did you manage to not break any of the delicate Christmas ornaments around the shop? Did you scorch the place clean of all holiday items? Did you throw your bucket dispenser's hat into the fire? The number of Steam achievements here gives the game some replayability beyond trying to see how fast or how messy you can clean things up.  The black humor found in the game's macabre setting is hit and miss, however; some of the fun in a new level of VCD is seeing how awful the messes are and figuring out a way to efficiently get things done. Some of the outlandish deaths and scenes you uncover work great, but I think the humor found in Santa's letters that outline his descent into booze and bullets felt like the writers were trying too hard. There are nuggets of humor but we get it when all the kids just want the latest expensive gadgets even though they behave like brats. A few letters are fine but after a while they all sound the same.The physics can get wonky still in a few places but this level still shows the level of polish that Runestorm is trying to create with their small team. Who knew that Santa going on an alcohol-fueled rampage could lead to one of the best Christmas releases ever? So what are you waiting for? Strap on your candy striped rubber gloves, grab your mop and get ready to save Christmas!			"

												You spend hours and hours cleaning up Santa's bloody workshop with dead elfs everywhere. You think you're almost done then BOOM, TNT explodes out of no where and you're back to square one, and if you actually manage to clean everything up your're still no done, WHY!? YOU MAY ASK BECAUSE THERES SOME LITTLE PIECE OF DEAD ELF LODGED IN A UN REACHABLE CORNER THAT YOU CAN'T FIND AND YOU SPEND HOURS OF YOUR LIFE LOOKING FOR THIS LITTLE PIECE OF DEAD ELF BUT NEVER FIND IT AND YOU RAGE QUIT IN SHAME AND AGONY. You finally settle you're self done and get ready to go to bed reasuring your self that tomorrow is a new day and things will be different BUT GUESS WHAT IT'S NOT AND YOU'RE THROWN INTO THE EMOTIONAL ROLLERCOASTER AGAIN AND AGAIN IN A NEVER ENDING LOOP! 10/10 RECOMMEND THIS GAME			"

												Se você jogou o Viscera Cleanup Detail e gostou, nem sei porque você tá lendo isso, compra de uma vez, jumento, digo, caro leitor(a) !  Mas se você é como eu, que conhecia pouco do jogo, então vê a armadilha de satanás: ""Olha, uma Summer/Winter Sale, vou comprar aquele joguinho lá"", vamos esclarecer alguns pontos: *Se você fica put..sso com facilidade, este jogo vai fazer você jogar seu notebook/pc/polistation contra a parede e ir ao mais fundo grau de loucura lovecraftiana. Cada balde caindo no chão era um soco na mesa.* Se você não pode com sangue ou gore, você não devia estar nem aqui, queridx!*Se você tem algum apreço à física, Vai chorar sangue.* Se você está acostumadx apenas a rpgs, fps e diabo a quatro, melhor continuar em Roma, César. * Se você não faz a menor ideia de como jogar essa joça, busque um gameplay ou um guia antes.* Se você não gosta de jogos repetitivos, nada pra ver aqui, circulando!* Se a sua vida não é uma profunda espiral de vazio e desespero, onde a simulação da morte é um consolo até a derradeira hora, melhor jogar Skyrim ou outro ralo de tempo. MAS.... SE VOCÊ NÃO SE IDENTIFICA COM NENHUM DOS QUESITOS ACIMA,  VAI QUE É TUA TARAFAEEEELLLL!!!, sério, se a premissa insana e a jogabilidade mais insana ainda te atrairam, eu sou apenas um grãozinho furioso de areia no meio do deserto da SteamNota: Eu não conhecia o jogo, a não ser pelo trailer e algumas imagens, estava por R$ 1,99 na Summer Sale, só comprei para dar uma arredondada na conta. Falo como jogadora de primeira viagem, entendam isto. If you played Viscera Cleanup Detail and liked, I don't know why are you reading this, buy it right away, d.mb.ss!, i mean, dear reader. But if you were like me who knew a little 'bout the game, then see the Devil's trap "" Hey, look a Summer/Winter sale, I'm gonna buy that game! Let's straight the records first:*If you get mad easily, this game gonna make you throw your laptop/pc/whatever against the wall and get down in the deepest level of lovecraftian madness. Each falling bucket was a punch in the table.*If you're weak for blood and gore, you shouldn't be here at first time.*If you like/care 'bout physic, you're going to cry blood tears.*If you're used to Rpgs/Fps and stuff, Stay in Rome, Caeser!*If you don't have a single ideia how play this thing, look for a gameplay/guide before buying it.*If you don't like repetitive games, nothing to see here!*If you life isn't a deep spiral of emptyness and desespair, where the simulation of death is a pacifier until the very last hours, better play Skyrim or another time drain.BUT.... IF YOU DON'T IDENTIFY YOURSELF WITH NONE OF THE REASONS MENTIONED BEFORE, GET DOWN IN THE SICKNESS, BOYS AND GIRLS ! (In the Br Portuguese review, the joke is better but impossible to translate decently), Seriously,  if the insane propose and gameplay really caught your eye and your heart, I'm just a furious grain of sand in the Steam desert.P.S: I didn't knew the game, only by the trailer ans some pics, it was R$ 1,99 (Not going to convert it in dollars, #uckers), just bought it to not pay a broken number bill, I speak as a newbie player, so have compreehension. P.S II = Estava barato... barato demais. So cheap for a reason...			"

												This game is funny and werid. And yes, if you have come to the reviews to see if this is REALLY just cleaning up after Santa Claus, yes. It is. Fun with friends but you probably wont play it longer than a few hours. If the $2 is worth it to you to get it and have fun with friends then by all means do so. By yourself you may get tired. Its also a bit buggy but nothing game breaking fro what I've seen. P.S.  check min requirements.			"

												This is really fun for some reason, I like cleaning I guess.This game will provide enjoyment for some reason or another.It is not so much the cleaning up dead bodies; more the physics, the graphics, and the easter eggs, I find addicting. Plus, you get your own office with even more easter eggs, some unlockable.			"

I would be walking like normal and then suddenly I would be blasted across the map and my hard work would be ruined.I had a molotav randomly explode when I picked it up- and half the stuff was glitched.Everything is just too hyper sensitive- I tried putting things in the waste basket to make things easier and I knocked it over and it flew across the room by putting a knife in it.It's not bad game! It's just got wayy too many bugs right now for me. I'll change my review if it gets an update.			"

												I was thinking of buying the full Viscera Cleanup Detail game but after playing this I'm glad I didn't. There are no tutorials so if you don't understand anything, tough. It seems they went down the road of making a har har physics game rather than something with actual gameplay. Often, you end up making more of a mess than you're cleaning due to unavoidable clumsiness that the game seems to think is part of the fun.			"

												I love this game. Lots of fun. But for the people who wonder what the codes in the game are: They are keys for steam games on steam. And you can not activate them becouse some random jerk used all of them. So if you expect to get any of the game keys to work. No luck. Also all keys are for the serious sam collection so if you like that i dunno. anyway a fun game			"

												This game will slowly suck your life away until you come across christmas again, and then you will be sucked into a endless loop of listening to ninja funk while cleaning up santa's workshop and seeing dead elves over and over again until you finally realize there is a thing called a life.  You will walk out into the world and find out you've been playing the game for 20 years.  And 3 years later you will become the same janitor cleaning up everything until you finally quit, massacre everyone on a space station with the help of aliens, then you will turn on the aliens and use you 2nd item and shove it up their♥♥♥♥♥until everyone on the space station is dead.  You will find yourself cleaning up the mess with your imaginary coop friend and once you clean everything up you destroy you imaginary friend with the plasma gun and findout you just shot the generator, exploding the space station while your brain fries cause of oxygen deprivation with the vaccum of space destroying your brain you remember when you were a 20 year old playing the same exact game that your living in... and right before your brain is completley gone, you remember this all started with the game called viscera cleanup detail: Santa's rampage.  Couple years later you have been revived and you find yourself shooting aliens while stopping more aliens that will destroy the human race called reapers.  You finally get to the guide system and end up sacrificing yourself to save humanity even though you have been controlled by a rogue reaper the whole time.  As darkness consumes you... you awaken in a mansion in a place called Los Santos in the state of san andreas with your wife who has been cheating on you after your yaght has been stolen and your son almost died on a freeway.  You decide to go outside and go downtown, you pull out a ak-47 and start shooting everyone you see. 1 minute later you are shot 30 times by the swat and police.  Hours later you find yourself in hong kong waiting for your friend Kane while trying to extort money from some guy, 30 minutes and 15 dead bodies later you cornor him and he slits the throat of a stripper who was being dragged by the guy following him slitting his own throat.  AHHHHHHHH @!@#!#%@%#^$@ holy !@#$!  You find out it was just a dream and you completed the game Santa's rampage.  You step outside and...you were playing that game for 20 years.			"

												Have you ever wanted to clean up a bloody mess? Have you ever wanted to kill the child in you by exploring Santa's Workship after a horrible murder event? Hate christmas and enjoy seeing terrible things that are christmas related? This game can satisfy all those evil thoughts and desires. Explode TNT, collect Santa's shotgun, clean up poor little Elves that had it coming. Not enough? Grab a friend and beat each other senselessly with elf limbs. 10/10 would clean.			"

												Visceral Cleanup is a interesting (and insane) concept with poor development  qualities.Gameplay 4/10 The game tasks you as the cleanup crew after Santa goes off the deep end. (Santa is tired of  increasing taxes, children wanting one of everything, and the tedium of being a jolly ole soul for over a millienia). What ensues is a bloody and eggnog fueled rampage from said jolly ole soul. The game has you cleaning up dead elves, reindeer, bottles of booze/eggnog, letters from a unfaithful Mrs. Claus and other bits of ridicliousness. Kudos goes to the game dev. for a orginial game and funny concept. Where the game falls flat is in the actual development .I can't be to hard on this because of two things,first this is a indie game that is still in development and second the price tag is only 2.50. For the amount of gameplay/achievements that you get the price tag isnt bad at all. But when the game will not let you complete said achievements because of  under development it can be problematic. Graphics  8/10The graphics do a good job of  dropping you into the jolly legends workshop. The happy, cheery enviroment is a stark contrast to the blood and gore  in the game. It is a very detailed (right down to tracking bloddy footprints behind you when you step in viscera). The graphics arent the best in the world but they do get the job done.Sound 8/10The sound is much the same as the graphics they  are very detailed. All of the sounds that you would expect to hear are present and accounted for, If you pick up a eviscerated elf you will hear the jingle of the bells  attached to his  shoes. This is just one example of the sound design. As a side note there is a radio that plays terrible Christmas music that...if you are anything like me...you  will quickly destroy the radio.Final NoteI can't recommend this game in its current state. The graphics,sound and gameplay all make for a interesting game. I can recommend someone  to keep a eye on this game because with more time this could be a fun  game.. Also the game is fun and very funny I enjoyed myself with it I just wish the gameplay was there a bit more,			"

												Good game. nice graphics and very funny.... although its not very entertaining anymore after you finish it the first time as there are no new objectives or levels to unlock, the game is very buggy as well because if you miss the tiniest speck of ♥♥♥♥ing dirt you cannot complete it....i found myself in the UDK console running dev commands to be able to actually complete the game i recommend this game if all you wanna do is♥♥♥♥♥♥around and do nothing but throw mutilated elves and reindeer all over the place for hours on end other than that its a thumbs down 3/10			"

												As the title suggests, play the role of a janitor sent to clean up the aftermath of Santa's rampage through his workshop. When you first enter you'll be surprised to find just how bad the rampage was. Gameplay is pretty basic, clean up the workshop and dispose of Santa's victims to clear the game. The mop cleans up blood and soot, the tracker locates messes or objects, and your hands grab/throw things. The mop has two uses first is to clean and the other kind of acts as a mean to strike/hit objects. The tracker's blue scanner tracks nearby messes while the green tracks potential objects you need to dispose of to clear the stage in a ""hot-and-cold"" style. Low slow beeps when nothing is near to high rapid ones the closer you get. With your hands you can pick up just about any object or activate machines to dispense tools to help you clean.One machine will dispense water buckets used to clean your mop when it's absorbed too much filth. Another machine will produce special bins you can carry trash, items, and objects in to dispose of. Oddly enough the only way to dispose of dirty water, objects, and bins themselves is to drop it into the fireplace. Sometimes however the bucket dispenser will drop out TNT bundles or body parts which can make your task even more frustrating. It's recommended you keep a water bucket at hand to drop the TNT into as quickly as it appears to prevent it from exploding. Unfortunately this isn't information they tell you and I lost count how many times I had to flee from the room to prevent getting blown up. Adding insult to injury you then have to clean up the mess left behind.The bins can be equally frustrating. Meant to make your task easier they can also make it tedious. Objects are easily knocked around and if you bump into the bin from the wrong angle expect it to tip over. They do give you the ability to rotate things back to a standing position via grabbing and using the activation button. However if you have anything in that bin expect it to go flying all over the room. I must have knocked over the same bin at least a dozen times or had to clean it up again because the objects went flying. For the most part if you fill it right and properly grab the bin it remains fairly sturdy when moving it around. So they do have some use.Now the biggest annoyance has to be the messes themselves. Even after playing for a few hours, scouring every spot I could find there were still hidden spots I couldn't and choosing to ""Clock-Out"" would deem an automatic failure. A tiny invisible splotch of blood you can't see, a smudge from an explosion. The tiny bulbs that hang on the tree and garland count as messes too if they leave a colored paint splatter upon breaking. Sometimes this can be on the ceiling out of reach because a stick of TNT went off. Only way to reach them requires cheating. Due to bugs the mess you need to mop up might be hidden under the floor preventing you from finding it too. The tracker is little help since it doesn't specifically show what you missed. So again in this case you may need to resort to using the ""KillNearbyMess"" command to clear it. Currently the game is still in a beta-like stage so hopefully this will be fixed in later patches.Overall the game is a novelty and can be fun if you only want to cause mayhem, especially for the price. But after you've beaten it (There's only the workshop.) then that's it, after all that you won't likely play it again. Tossing dead elves around or blowing things up with the TNT can only entertain for so long. If you have a friend who's already bought the game, try it out for yourself before you buy. In the long run there's other games that can offer more replayability than this. Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage for the price is pretty good, but frustrations and having to resort to cheating just to clear it prevents me from giving a recommendation for now.			"

												Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage ReviewI first found out about this game from my friend. He really enjoys the game and I think has put at least 50 hours into it. I write a review after 10 hours of playtime unless I can't stand it. I've wanted Santa's Rampage for a long time and I finally got it. The controls work most of the time, random times when carrying buckets and elf body parts fall for no reason is really fustrating. The graphics are fantastic. A full on 10 for that. It may not be a FarCry landscape but they are not bad graphics. Being a janitor in a game... what the hell? Who wants to play that? It's first-person. You mop up stuff, YOU MOP UP SANTA'S WORKSHOP. The fire-place is your main place to go, that's where you put the Elf parts that cause blood and all the extra items you want out of the area. You use the mop the most, cleaning up blood, booze, weird ornament ooze? You also have your bare hands where you can pick up elf parts and buckets and cans and all this stuff. The next thing is this weird radar that still to this day, I don't know what it does so to me, it's useless. Now to actually start my review.You basically have 5 rooms, each time you play the game with a new job to clean, it's randomly generated blood and gore. It's just you. The easter eggs are a great part of this game and without giving too much away, finding the floor boards and rudolf's nose. Cleaning with the mop is very easy and very fun to do, you will have to dip it into the bucket multiple times which gets dirty and then you need to get a new bucket. This is actually a pretty fun concept until it's greatly overused. There's an achievement for cleaning the whole workshop and I put 4 hours into it trying to do it, ending up at the end not getting it because an ornament was stuck behind a plant. That's pretty fustrating. The greatest sense of accomplisment at ALL in this game is cleaning each room and completely finishing it. What I find pretty cool is at the beginning you can get a BRAND-NEW generated character, find out the age and backstory... BUT IT HAS NO MEANING WHAT-SO-EVER. I don't expect Viscera Cleanup Detail to have a story-line but it's the same game but in Santa's Workshop. There is one way you can die and that's blowing yourself up with TNT which half the time isn't throwable so you can't choose to die... you do it anyway. You can find Santa's shotgun and pistols but nope, you can't shoot them. I'm not expecting them to be able to shoot but it would have been a cool easteregg. This game is $2.49 and that's a pretty good deal but not entirely for this game, I'm sorry. You don't have much workspace and it's close-corredored. You are a guy but it doesn't matter who you are because it has no meaning. Most of the achievements and controls don't work and the stupid radar thing isn't useful. There's no tutorial so you have to find out how to do stuff, throws you right into it.Multiplayer is a joke and I hate saying it. My friend and I played it once using IP addresses. You have to download this stupid program to get your stupid IP address to play, how would you know that? Besides, even with a PING on both sides of 20, it's super laggy and with your resolution down. Also, did I mention the game is not full-screen unless you set it to be full? The only time when it's not laggy is when you're using your mop or hands and not moving around. There is a jump function, what do you need it for? There's one game mode, there's not even a game mode... you clean. < That I don't complain about because it's fun for an hour and that's about it. Let me say what I like about it (unfortuantely, it's not a lot) the graphics are really cartoony and cool. It's something fresh that a 60 dollar game doesn't really have. The backstory and name's and ages of characters before play is cool even if there's no follow-up to it. Clocking out is feeling legit even if it's a 2-second thing. Using the mop is a blast for a bit, it's something new. Making it first-person is super cool. Finding the easter eggs is pretty sweet. Making a bigger mess and clocking off like a terrible guy at his job makes getting the achievement for it so much sweeter.Unfortauntely, this is my first game that uh... I like and don't like. Even for $2.49 which may seem good, the game is not worth the money. It's about an hour's worth of gameplay if you weren't going for achievements and easter eggs. Otherwise, you get about 10 hours of playtime like me. Multiplayer sucks, fix it and don't use IP addresses. Give us a tutorial, if it weren't for my friend... I don't think that I would've gotten very far into the game without getting fustrated. Controls are 50/50, mop works the best out of everything. Easter-eggs don't do anything (shotgun and pistols) and same with character development. You know what I would've wanted to see maybe at one point like when YOU COMPLETELY CLEAN THE PLACE and about to clock-off... Santa comes. If the game was about a dollar or maybe even free-to-play it would be worth it, but in my opinion and I love the original Viscera Cleanup Detail and hope to see more, Santa's Rampage isn't worth it and it may get a couple laughs out of you but you won't last more than an hour unless you find a way to. Check the floorboards upstairs and remove them, you get a surprise inside. -Detroit0127			"

												First I tought this game will be interesting, but it became boring really fast.Basically you pick up things and put it in the fire. Then clean the bloodstains with a weird mop. That's all, the only challenge is to fight with the annyoing phisycs and bugs. I played it when my brain had no capacity to play anything else.Luckily I won this in a giveaway, I wouldn't spend a dime on it.There are so many good and cheap indie games out there, this is not one of them. Spend your money on something else.			"

												Personal Rating: 3/10I never knew cleaning could be this bloody monotonous. I mean, the idea is good in context, but it's delivered in such a boring way. It's entertaining for the first five minutes. That's it. All the enjoyment you will get out of it. It's a very, themed game. Christmas. But you'd think there would be some resounding factor about it. You CLEAN. That is it. It's down there with Woodcutter Simulator and Airport Simulator 2013. Well, a little bit above it. The music is annoying, but at least the map is, small? It's very hard to find a resounding factor about a cleaning simulator.			"

												In all, this is a good game. Let me start at the beginning.      Viscera Cleanup Detail started as a standalone mini-game for Shadow Warrior. While it was boring cleaning up dead guys, the gore shocked most. Now in this edition, apparantly Santa got pressured by elves, dumb wish lists, and reindeer crap. He took a shotgun, a knife, and rage, and killed everyone. While this is disturbing for those young Steamers out there, once again, the gore shocked most into playing it repeatedly. The game features those surgeon simulator graphics, so it wasn't realistic. However, the graphics mean nothing. The only thing that caught players' attentions, was the shocking aftermath and story. So in conclusion, the cleaning is boring for most, but the fact that Santa melted under pressure shocked players into enduring @#$! to clean it all up!			"

												I played the free Alpha version of the normal one, wasn't a big fan of.This one is a bit better, but still, not worth it.You might aswell buy another games, which are cheaper now. For example The Binding of Isaac. Not everyone is a fan of the game, but you might like it. There is a Demo version on New Grounds (Google) to try out at least.Pro's+Nice Graphics+Easy Controls+Fun until you explored anything+Can explode things(Procon(?)=HAD 15 codes, which can be activated on steam to get Serious Sam copies)Con's-Not much content-Too expensive for such game-Bad Engine    -Holds the paper and stuff weird.   -When you're on things, like presents, you get buggy and fly around-Can't get rid of the trash you clean up with the yellow box-Can't get rid of the dirty water-Sometimes you get dirty stuff from the waterdispenser instead of a bucket of water, which makes the area even more dirtier-When those elves touch the ground, it gets extremely dirtyThese Pro's and Con's are on the other Cleanup games aswell.(Sorry if there are grammatical mistakes)			"

												Well that was fun, bought this before I was going to buy the actual game to see if I like it.  I bought it with a friend and we couldn't join each other.  Found out you had to open ports and stuff, well that didn't work so you had to use Haramachi or some weird shday program do join each other?  Screw that.  Refunded.  I was really looking foward to this game.  Looks like it'll give a good laugh.			"

												If you like getting fustrated over a big mess, this is the game for you.It's laggy and annoying. I kept having to clean the same room because the game decided to give me exploding TNT instead of buckets. There's a line between fun and hardwork, and games are usualy to escape from that last one. This game could be fun, but the fact that it's too messy, hard to clean and also that  there's not even a save button makes it boring. I don't like to have to play a game all at once, specialy when it's so fustrating that makes me want to rage quit.If I wanted to clean houses and do hard work i'd be cleaning my house instead of procastinating, like what i'm doing right now.other than all of that, i did like the enviromnent of the game and the theme itself.

												Seemed like it could be a cool little game to mess with for $2. Didn't take long to lose interest and uninstall. For starters, it throws you into the game without directions. Once I looked at the control setup in the options menu I was able to figure out that I needed to get buckets and disposal bins from the machines. Just throwing that on the screen upfront would have been nice. Then the mopping. You get like 3 swipes of the mop before it starts splashing blood everywhere making a bigger mess than the 3 swipes you cleaned up. While this may increase realness, it also sucks the fun out of it. And I kept knocking over the water bucket whenever I went to dip it. Is it really necessary to make the water bucket fall over that easily? It's just so tedious. I couldn't imagine it being fun in any way after realizing I'd need to clean my mop every 3 swipes. And you leave footprints everywhere any time you step in blood and well, there's blood everywhere. Hard not to step in it. And the first person view makes it hard to see what is directly below you. And if your mop starts throwing blood around, it seems a surefire way to get it on your shoes. I'm sure if you have patience for this game to move at a very slow methodical pace, taking inch by inch, you could probably master what the game expects. I don't know about other players, but I don't really want to spend hours dipping my mop and cleaning up my shoes. It's just unappealing.There are a lot of setting options. I had to adjust resolution, toggle off window mode, adjust field of vision and mouse sensitivity, and toggle off head bob. So it's nice the options are all there to customize, but it still made me nauseated playing.			"

												Fun for a bit, shame of the bugs. Spent hours cleaning everything up and then found that a piece of intestine fell through the floor next to the bin-spawner and a candle beneath the fireplace (although I don't think that one counted for 'mess'). Impossible to get at. Cheated for no-clip so I could get to them. But it still wouldn't pick them up. Changed back to normal while beneath the floor and died. No way to get back. No tropy for finishing the cleanup. :(Gave up on it and restarted, then cheated the place clean because I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Still didn't get the finishing tropy because I got the 'chrismas items all still intact' tropy which I didn't deserve.

 Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage. Welp... It finally happened. Jolly ol´ Saint Nick burnt out and snapped. And Bloody hell! Did he leave a mess....Several poor elves wont be returning to their families today, aye it´s a sad day for North Pole. Well if you played any other Cleanup Detail game, this is pretty much the same as the previous.Guts to cleanup, bodyparts to bin and buckets of blood to mop of the floor...And the game is about as buggy as any other instalment in the ""series"".  HARGH!  Sorry.. I just cant call a game a series if its the same thing over and again..  CoD joke removed, due to me not wanting to deal with caffeinated preschoolers. ANY-WAYS TO WEEKEND!The game is still a buggy pile of  FUN, didn't see that coming did ya ? , and yet even if its pretty much a janitor simulator.  And i just removed 5 very offense and very, very sensitive subject jokes, don't hate me. And i really should not drink this much coffee when i've only had under 6 hours of sleep. Might make me a bit erratic.			"

It's an easy gift to get someone and play with, i just cant wait until they have a fully developed multiplayer option. The only thing that sucks are the glitches and bugs where items dissapear off the map which makes it impossible to complete some of the achievments. I also hope they release more map content.			"

												I really dont know what to say about this game, although ive had over 4 hours of it in only 2 days, you would think i enjoy it.. But its just addicting so once your on it and cleaning up, you just cant stop, i dont know what it is.. Its very very fustrating and when things dont go your way, you may even come close to rage quitting (yes, i found that hard to beleive at first myself)Its one of them games that takes time for you to get into, thing is though, Ive still not really got into it and only play it for the acheivments to be honest!

												A well made game, pretty funny and hilarious too.it ca also be extremely annoying if for example the bucket machine spews out a TNT and makes a mess of everything you just spent cleaning. There is a technique, which is basically do small areas at a time, rather than try to burn all of the elves first, it will just make more mess.There are a couple of bugs where things get stuck but fortunately there are some commands to clear them up so you can get the acheievements.A game recommended for anyone who has OCD or just perfectionism in general.

I am pretty sure that I am not the only one who would wonder if Santa went on a complete batshit insane rampage, only to wonder who would clean it all up, and wonder what it would be like. This is an answer to that call, and well worth the playthrough, and several after that. I will be for sure supporting these developers by buying the $7.99 pack which includes Viscera Cleanup Detail, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior, and Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage.

												This game is much more fun than it should be (now with much loved save function!) There's something satisfying about burning elf bodies in the fire and seeing the bloody mess wash away under your mop. Then again, it's also just as much fun to throw elf parts into a trunk and use all the leftover molotovs and dynamite to blow up what's still standing.  The ""story"" can be found in letters that you find, and all the flavor text and details just add to the experience. I clean more in this game than I clean in real life, and that's ok. Worth picking up, and I will definately be picking up the other Viscera Cleanup Detail games in the future!			"

It's tedious, lengthy, and an OCD nightmare. However, it was extremely entertaining, especially with a friend. Don't try achievement hunting with a friend though, only one of you will get the achievement for all the hard work you both did.			"

It's also great for when you wanna play with your friends, with the Co-op.  Although, recognize what kind of player your friends are.  Some are jokers who do what they're supposed to but also want to ♥♥♥♥ around.  Some are serious who like the get the task done with minimal hassel.  This game could either strengthen or break your friendships.10/10 would totally clean dead elves with friends again.			"

												This is an amazing game in many different ways!!! You can mess with TNT and blow up bottles and papers ETC. You get to clean up blood and dead body parts and as groose and boring as that may sound it can give you hours of fun especially if your OCD and want to lean every square inch of Santas house. There are also two other games that go with the original and shadow warriors which just have new maps that you can clean and find new things in. The whole game series is amazing with a pretty nice look to it and it runs very smoothly even when recording. So if your a huge fan of good looking games, simulators ETC then buy this game plus when there are $2.49 deals for this game its a no brainer buy for this game!!!			"

												If you like messing around in ""real"" games for hours-on-end after you've already beaten them, then VCD may be entertaining for you. It's like unlocking an ""anti game"" play mode in a serious FPS where you get to totally go against the normal play style.If you like to just play an FPS game, beat it, then move on to the next challenge... VCD will probably bore you to tears.Essentially, you'll either love or hate VCD. There's not too much middle ground.Santa's Rampage was an interesting entry in the VCD experience, but, once again, they didn't really tap any potential beyond what normal VCD provides. No exploration, no secrets, no puzzles... just cleaning.I know VCD revolves around cleaning, but I view VCD in the same vein as the Thief series of games. You have a primary game-play aspect, but certain levels and things had you solving mysteries and messing around with other stuff as a secondary aspect. VCD needs to really tap into this potential if it wants to grow beyond ""cleaning simulator"" status.The stage is entertaining, but you end up with dynamite that doesn't seem to serve a purpose other then make a mess when incinerated (unless you know how to properly dispose of it). The slaughter was funny to look at. There's a few gimicky secrets (eg: the painting that tosses x-mas balls when you whack it).But, it's mostly just x-mas themed VCD. I know, that's what you would expect. But, I think they could have done more with this. I still recommend it, though.			"

												It's a decent game with good graphics but the game gets repetitive and bland very quickly, UNLESS you have a friend along for the ride. Playing co-op makes it a completely different game, you will mostly mess around and blow each other up with dynamite but that's what makes the experience truely memorable. So i do recommend this game if you have friend(s) to play it with.			"

												If you ever want to just clean stuff, you just play this game.The game itself is more of a one time play-through, but there is satisfaction to be found in discovering the little secrets that the achievements point out. I do wish there was a bonus type level after you actually finish cleaning the whole place.It's a very detailed process. You clean the mop, you clean a bloody spot, you re-clean your mop, and your bucket gets dirtier. Rinse, repeat, Victory! It is simple to understand, but just a silly process.It's definitely a fun little game, and I would recommend this game :)			"

												This is a very good game. And a steal at that for the price of $2.49. I would honestly say it is worth more. This game is that fun. I am pretty sure that I am not the only one who would wonder if Santa went on a complete batshit insane rampage, only to wonder who would clean it all up, and wonder what it would be like. This is an answer to that call, and well worth the playthrough, and several after that. I will be for sure supporting these developers by buying the $7.99 pack which includes Viscera Cleanup Detail, Viscera Cleanup Detail: Shadow Warrior, and Viscera Cleanup Detail: Santa's Rampage.

However myself and my mate were unable to finish the game because blood was on the roof of the main room. We spent around 20 minutes trying to stack up table stools and we were unable to do so. On the other hand the uniqueness of this game makes it worth playing, it is funny and it was entertaining to play with a friend. One last thing be careful when using the disposable boxes because it's a bit buggy, stuff tends to fall out.Regards,Class			"

Uhm... it is a good cleaning simulator game!I know you can't imagine playing a game where you have to clean, when you hate cleaning a huge mess in the real world. But the developers somehow made cleaning fun in this game! Even better and funnier with friends, because you can make a bigger mess, than the starting mess! "

												This game is fun it helps ease you OCD one thing i would like to figure out is that whats up with all the codes around the map like santas desk and the stair well to the raindeer passage...could the community try to figure this out many questions unsolved but all in all its a fun game after a while take a break it gets boring 9/10			"

												So santas fed up with greedy little children asking for to much, so he has a meltdown and takes it all out on his elfs by brutaly murdering them. That sums up the whole story. So your job is to be a clean up elf, or a human I dont know which one you play as. Pretty much you are armed with your hands, a mop, and a digital remote which no one know's what it acctually does.Thats it you just clean up the blood and make the workshop tidy again, now as lame as it all sounds it is acctually quite an enjoyable game with pretty nice graphics and a few difficult obstacles like TNT.Cant go wrong, it was under 2 dollars.Best christman game I have ever played.

												An exquisite masterpiece. If this game does not get GOTY I will be ashamed of the human race. This game perfectly blends screen tearing, mediocre graphics, and obnoxious blood. It is fantastic. You're a janitor cleaning up Santa's bloody mess of elves, toys, and explosives. Mop up blood, take elf parts, blow up dynamite, and don't forget, This is a simulator.... I found myself forgetting I was actually playing a game at some points. I felt like I was living the life of santa's Janitor! 10/10			"

												If you ever wanted to clean Santa's workshop....congrats now you can. Embrace the christmas spirit by: 1. Cleaning up blood, body parts , explosives...?!!???!?....and guns 2. Clean the place up to earn a paycheque or make a bigger mess to prove how much you love your job........i don't think we even get paid for cleaning so why not trash the place. 3. Listen to some music while your cleaning4. Find guts and other body parts fly out of your equipment5. Find all the guns and store them in your lunch box....you know for security....Viscera Clean Up detail has brought another fun short mission for you to clean with your friends or by yourself but I would strongly recommend with friends :D. If you like cleaning or something to just play around with, pick up Viscera Cleanup and enjoy your cleaning adventures.			"

												I have to admit this game makes me question why i'm willing to clean in a video game but not in real life XD. But I think this game is better with friends because it will take you over 30 mins. to clean Santa's entire workshop and stables. I have not yet cleaned the entire place but am very close! There are a couple of suggestions I do have for this game but highly doubt these will happen considering this was one of the 1st games this developer has made and has made such an improvement! Anyway my suggestions:1) THOSE DAMN BLOODY BUCKETS! I know I'm not the only one who has droped  a bloody bucket making more of a mess then I'd started with. If that could be disabled I will be very very very very very very very very happy.2) If there was an option to join a random game with players already in it instead of having to enter a password that would be cool too and a lot easier.Thanks for reading my Review and hope you get the game!

My waste baskets were all neatly piled up, ready for the incinerator...next thing I knew they were all over the floor.I spent the rest of the time creating a bigger mess than I started to make the next janitor appreciate how hard his job is...A/5 would ruin hard work again.

												This is a must have for anyone who is even a little bit OCD....anal-retentive....or who just loves to see blood and gore spread everywhere.  Santa went a little nutso in this game and decided to take his aggression out on the little creeps that make his toys.  It's a tedious sort of game where your goal is to simply clean up the aftermath of the massacre.  I dig it.			"

Grade: 72/100Difficulty: Awkward controls, which adds to the mess and makes it a challenge to complete some of the goals.Pros: Lets you vent your displeasure of the holiday season in a 'fun' way. Co-op makes it more entertaining.Cons: Could have more content. The music is aggravating as hell. Physics are overly wonky/sensitive which complicates a few game elements.Replayable: At least until you get sick of making a bloody mess. Or finish all the achievements.			"

												Okay, now this game is just NASTAY!!! You walk into the room, and there are just elf corpses and blood EVERYWHERE. Your job is to clean it all up with a mop. It's tedious, lengthy, and an OCD nightmare. However, it was extremely entertaining, especially with a friend. Don't try achievement hunting with a friend though, only one of you will get the achievement for all the hard work you both did.			"

												Got this as part of a bundle and thought it as the worst looking game in the lot. Still I tried it out to see how fast I could beat it and holy sh!t is this game tailor made for ppl with OCD. I got 100% in about 10 hours it was a lot of fun and all the bugs I read about have been patched. Its only $2.50 so I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to play a festive mop simulator game.			"

												Santa's Rampage is a small ""spin-off"" of Viscera Cleanup Detail, having only one-level with special theme to it. It also has engine updating alongside with big main game, multiplayer is working just fine as well. Physics on other hand...And yes, Unreal Engine 3. Whoop.You can say that this game is a FPS physics-driven game, as your main job is to clean up the place, cleaning blood and ashes off and burning down all the remains of Santa's insanity, aside from knifes. Knifes are important part of XMas. And you have to do that with brush, hands that apparently grow from butt, non-reliable mess-detecting device and machines that dispence buckets of water, contrainer and surprises. Oh, and fireplace. And listening to radio for music. Which you can burn as well. And having to figure out how to burn explosives safely.Well, or at least you have to clean it all up on theory, for the game doesn't require you to do that. You can finish the level anytime, it will just tell you to what kind of state the level fits (Cleaned, burned EVERYTHING or made even bigger mess), a game got few achievements on those. The level is quite detailed and it's fun to read Santa's letter and see what rampage left us with.Some achievements are very hard, I must say.And main idea of a game is that there is a lot of things that can go wrong, a mess can get even bigger by accident, and you have to handle all the incoming sudden problems up. Heck, you can just knock a bucket full of blood by accident and then leave bloody footprints all over the place. Giving you all the challenge in this game which lacks classic enemies. Though you still should have a love for chores and cleaning to begin with.Yet the game has big flaw. This physics-based game has a flaw, and a flaw comes from...physics. It's buggy. Stuff can clip through the floor or wall. Most often it can be thrown out by explosives. It doesn't feel good when you do a hour-long cleaning and then to find nothing left, because at one point you had explosion that threw something under level. You can still use cheats to clean the nearest mess. But it's not good either, as you are still unsure if game glitched or you just didn't notice something yet.And even if you ignore glitches, those hanging XMas balls are evil. If something explodes, chances are, they will be sent onto ceiling, breaking and leaving mess there. And it's very hard to reach such places, in hall, especially when playing alone. In this case you will have to build a ladder of stools, which is unrelaible, tedius and you may decided to burn all of them before, who knows.Flaws like these to ruin the enjoyment, if you want to properly and fairly clean the place, then you must be pretty much perfect from start. No fun from cleaning and fully fixing your own mess, as you are pretty much screwed from this point. Bai bai, proper cleaning achievement and message.This game also supports coop play with other players over Internet. Yes, you can respawn infinitively, in single-player mode too. So with a pair of friends it becomes pure joy and chaos. I recommend to play in this mode, even better as a first impression!So yes, I can still recommend this game, even if flawed. For sake of fun with friends. And a bit of cleaning chore love. It's an unique game, after all. Well, more like, a spin-off of a main unique game.I just hope that main Viscera Cleanup will be less frustation, at least it will not have XMas balls all over the place.			"

												Ever wanted to know what it feels like to carry a bucket of elf guts, and reindeer pieces? Well now you can!*Gameplay*+ Only fun you'll have cleaning up, ever+ Lots of variety in messes- Repetitive- Frustrating when you can't find that one little spot to get 100%- Only one map, so little replayability*Graphics*+ Cute, cartoon looking+ Bloody, gory, and perfect example of a Santa rampage- Glitches every so often, causes frustration- Unable to pick up some objects due to glitches*Story*+ Cute little notes to Santa Claus+ Not all are so ""cute"" or ""innocent""- No story besides Santa was in a bad mood+ No story really needed*Overall*Fun game, but has little to come back for after a couple hours. Only one map so you clean it up once fully, then destroy it as much as possible and that's.... well that's sort of it... Much better with friends though.Pick it up on sale (even though $3 is a reasonable price) for a few hours of entertainment. "

												Took me 5-6 hours to clean the place completely up, from which hour or two spent on stuff you couldn't find despite having the radar. Too bad not to see the good end, but I really had some fun because of my own stupidity here. It's a good game to play with friend, go bonkers and mess the place up while your friend does all the hard work and then blows you up when you aint looking.The glitching object you can't grab makes me want to not recommend this but there's too much fun for this low price to give a thumbs-down... and as for performance, on my semi-old laptop it works fine in 800x600 graphics and you dont lose anything there really.

Its very very fustrating and when things dont go your way, you may even come close to rage quitting (yes, i found that hard to beleive at first myself)Its one of them games that takes time for you to get into, thing is though, Ive still not really got into it and only play it for the acheivments to be honest!

												If you like messing around in ""real"" games for hours-on-end after you've already beaten them, then VCD may be entertaining for you. It's like unlocking an ""anti game"" play mode in a serious FPS where you get to totally go against the normal play style.If you like to just play an FPS game, beat it, then move on to the next challenge... VCD will probably bore you to tears.Essentially, you'll either love or hate VCD. There's not too much middle ground.Santa's Rampage was an interesting entry in the VCD experience, but, once again, they didn't really tap any potential beyond what normal VCD provides. No exploration, no secrets, no puzzles... just cleaning.I know VCD revolves around cleaning, but I view VCD in the same vein as the Thief series of games. You have a primary game-play aspect, but certain levels and things had you solving mysteries and messing around with other stuff as a secondary aspect. VCD needs to really tap into this potential if it wants to grow beyond ""cleaning simulator"" status.The stage is entertaining, but you end up with dynamite that doesn't seem to serve a purpose other then make a mess when incinerated (unless you know how to properly dispose of it). The slaughter was funny to look at. There's a few gimicky secrets (eg: the painting that tosses x-mas balls when you whack it).But, it's mostly just x-mas themed VCD. I know, that's what you would expect. But, I think they could have done more with this. I still recommend it, though.			"

												review:Seriously, I♥♥♥♥♥♥you not, the best money I've spent on steam in a while! So much fun for so little money. Great visuals, simple but hilarious gameplay, easy to kid around. First time playing it I've played nearly 3 hours non-stop. Even if you just play it once, it's a comical experience truely worth your money.multiplayer tip: Just one thing, the easiest way to play multiplayer is by far with hamachi. I know, I know, You want to show of your port forwarding skills and this and that. But that doesn't seem to work every time. Hamachi, however, worked first try. Just a little nugget of information.

												It's darkly amusing.Yet, oddly compelling, as you clean up after Santa's meltdown.I find the detail put into the game remarkable.  From the ironic festive Christmas theme underscoring a considerably darker reality to the challenge of handling very delicate, colorful glass ornaments while dealing with explosives, the game stupidly manages to draw you into its obsessive compulsive maw.I wish you could save your place... I don't know if I can really finish a room in one sitting.			"

												This is an amazing game in many different ways!!! You can mess with TNT and blow up bottles and papers ETC. You get to clean up blood and dead body parts and as groose and boring as that may sound it can give you hours of fun especially if your OCD and want to lean every square inch of Santas house. There are also two other games that go with the original and shadow warriors which just have new maps that you can clean and find new things in. The whole game series is amazing with a pretty nice look to it and it runs very smoothly even when recording. So if your a huge fan of good looking games, simulators ETC then buy this game plus when there are $2.49 deals for this game its a no brainer buy for this game!!!			"

												Surprisingly fun, if morbid. Needs to be longer, and/or have other missions. Also there are some game-breaking bugs, most notably, stuff falling through the floor. Also lacks a clear objective. Unless I screwed something up, it doesn't ever get to a ""win"" state.If the developers read this, why not modify the premise a little to ""clean up the workshop before the police arrive"". Then they investigate the place and if you left any evidence, you and Santa go to jail.Just an idea. Great game. Thanks!			"

												I have been looking for a morbid Christmas game since the Santa Slayer demo, about 10 or more years ago, and this was pretty much what I'm looking for. Almost like a sequal to it honestly, since Santa goes on a rampage. The only difference is, you're the one cleaning up, instead of killing...or you can make a mess.It's a pretty straight forward game, and not too fancy. You can make the mess way worse, sometimes without trying if you're not careful. Getting rid of the elf bodies takes some time, due to having to maneuver them to the bucket, without getting blood everywhere. I just got to the point where I burned them in the fireplace which excited me a bit too much. All in all, for the price, I think it's pretty fun.			"

												""A game where you clean, how can this be any fun?"". No idea why, but it is!You, alone or with friends, enters Santa's workshop after his breakdown. Its a complete mess. As a cleaner, your duty is to make the place look nice and tidy. But, there is more to it than that. You can choose to despose all the blood and gore or make more! Having this free will to do what you want makes the game so much more fun. And for some weird reason, if you choose to clean up Santa's Workshop it gives you a weirdly rewarding feeling.There are some negative sides to the game. It feels kinda small and you can get tired of it, that depends on your imagination. But all in all, its not very expensive and decent game, so i recomend it.			"

												VCD: Santa's Rampage is a rather odd game, I picked it up from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheap. Best amount of money I have ever spent, this is a Niche title, meaning there is nothing else like it anywhere, apart from Real Life....Being a Human Male, I despize Cleaning and everything that Women are supposed to do in the house. But this, this makes Cleaning bloomin' hilariousFirstly you are told to Clean the Workshop, simple enough. But then comes the fun part. Being able to smear dead Elves all over the walls and showing them how to Paint the Town Red. You can also Blow Up Dynamite....and Molotovs. Which is ♥♥♥♥ING annoying. As the game progresses you start to feel sympathy for the people who did bad in their GCSE's and A-Level and are now Minimum Wage paid Janitors. But...you know, Elf Body Parts. The Fun thing is the Collectables. You can slap them in your Janitor's chest and hey presto! Easy Achievements. The other fun thing is the Elf Body Parts....didn't I mention that already? One of the main bad things in this entire game, IS THE MOP BUCKETS. Knocking these ♥♥♥♥ers over is like having to ask Valve to release Half-Life 3. Never going to happen. The other bad thing is the Knives. Sometimes they get stuck UNDERNEATH the floor. You have to cheat. To complete the game...sometimes. Frustration is the main aspect of this game. In Conclusion.

												This game is not for everyone. It takes forever just to clean up one room and it's very frustrating toppling buckets of water over or spreading even more blood across the floor because you didn't realize your mop had gotten that dirty yet, ruining your last hour of work. However, once you get into the swing of things it does get easier. Not bad considering the price.			"

												If you ever wanted to clean Santa's workshop....congrats now you can. Embrace the christmas spirit by: 1. Cleaning up blood, body parts , explosives...?!!???!?....and guns 2. Clean the place up to earn a paycheque or make a bigger mess to prove how much you love your job........i don't think we even get paid for cleaning so why not trash the place. 3. Listen to some music while your cleaning4. Find guts and other body parts fly out of your equipment5. Find all the guns and store them in your lunch box....you know for security....Viscera Clean Up detail has brought another fun short mission for you to clean with your friends or by yourself but I would strongly recommend with friends :D. If you like cleaning or something to just play around with, pick up Viscera Cleanup and enjoy your cleaning adventures.			"

												This is a must have for anyone who is even a little bit OCD....anal-retentive....or who just loves to see blood and gore spread everywhere.  Santa went a little nutso in this game and decided to take his aggression out on the little creeps that make his toys.  It's a tedious sort of game where your goal is to simply clean up the aftermath of the massacre.  I dig it.			"

												Santa's Rampage is a trip.  The worst part of it is that you have to clean up the horrible mess he made when he went nuts killing everyone and everything in sight..  Even poor Rudolph wasn't spared..  Santa!  what have you done?!If you don't mind cleaning up blood and guts, and burning everything in sight, then you might find this game funny as hell..  Not the best game in the world, but you can't beat the price.  And just in time for Christmas too.   Not recommended for minors that's for sure.It's too bad you can't get any Steam cards for a badge to this game.  A Rudolph Badge would have looked awesome!  And YES, I would buy the badge!			"

												SPOILERS!I suggest you have a powerful hardrive, because this game will go to 23 frames a second if you don't. Anyway, this game isnt as fully featured as its cousins in the Viscera series. It lacks voice and only has one small map, which has enough junk to fill up two maps. I recommend this game if you enjoyed the others in the series (in this time period, the trilogy). You clean up after Santa has had it, seeing letters found through-out the game show he was in massive debt and kids are just plain annoying and demmanding. Cleanup Santas work area, throw out raindeer carcas, remove elf bodies from the premisis, and most annoying of all, get rid of TNT without killing yourself (Tip: its a very short timer).I give it 3 stars, and it's a great way to pass the time.

												A game that makes you want to do something you dread IRL - clean. Hilariously fun, especially playing with a friend. So many WTF moments when all of a sudden something explodes and kills you, when the bucket of bloody water gets knocked over, and the damn bloody footprints that appear out of nowhere when you've already clean the area around you! Somewhat unpolished, buggy, glitchy. If that's something that really bothers you, steer clear for now. But for $2? How can you lose! Only complaint I have is connecting to a multiplayer game requires opening ports and inputting your hosts' Global IP manually. Other than that, it's unsettlingly fun. Still don't know what the sniffer tool does though. If somebody can enlighten me on this I would greatly appreciate it.			"

												Tedious took me 2 and a half hours to get all the blood gone but if you blow stuff up causes stains on the roof witch you cannot reach. I'll admit it was very funny and cool at first but as soon as i figured out how to clean and got everything done it got boring fast. I would suggest not using explosives considering they will just cause unreachable stains and bottles you cannot reach to dispose of. The multiplayer I have not tryed but I think it would be 10x faster and more fun with a partner.RATING: 6/10WHAT I RECOMMEND:I recommend if you have spare 2.50 in your steam wallet and so does a friend to buy it and mess around it is fun finding all the hidden dead elfs. If you are playign by yourself don't even get this game.			"

												This game is ridiculous. It's is cheesy and amazing all at the same time. It's also a good download if you want to waste a few hours. The controls are easy to pick up and objectives are easy to figure out. The achievements are also a fun way to fool around with all the sick things this game has to offer.			"

												Scrub-a-dub-dub, three elf heads in a tub. If you aren't easily offended and have a sense of humor, this is a great game. If you are OCD, this is a great game. Clean blood, dispose of body parts. Simple. Fun. Time consuming. What more could you want?I recommend this game, because the humor and fun value I had playing it far outweighed my general $1/hour of gameplay required rule. Granted, I ended up playing it a second time with another friend, so I guess I did get more than the full value out of it, but I wouldn't expect to be playing this for more than an hour, so judge that how you will. If you buy Shadow Warrior, you get the Shadow Warrior version of it, which is better value, imo. The base game is also $8 base and is still being developed, with presumably multiple levels, unlike this one, so that might be the best bet. You can still pick this one up for cheap and see if you like it though.			"

However myself and my mate were unable to finish the game because blood was on the roof of the main room. We spent around 20 minutes trying to stack up table stools and we were unable to do so. On the other hand the uniqueness of this game makes it worth playing, it is funny and it was entertaining to play with a friend. One last thing be careful when using the disposable boxes because it's a bit buggy, stuff tends to fall out.Regards,Class			"

												Its strangely addicting, However i had a few complains and suggestions! :P 1-  Make your mop upgradable! So you don't have to go through about 50 buckets for one room! haha.2- Cut the % that a limb will come out of a dispenser, It happens way too often, 5 times in a row in my last game =/ 3- Add Ladders!4- Add a broom/shovel for smaller bits! :P5- Add something like a saw to cut things into smaller pieces! 6- I dunno if its capable, but add randomly generated stuff, Right now, The game has no replay value.I have plenty more ideas to improve this game, but those are the main ones i believe should be seen to.Anyway, I recommend this game, but just keep in mind its the kinda game you just day dream in, its not fast paced, quite then opposite. Just also remember right now, There is no replay value to be had.:) 7/10			"

												VCD: Santa's Rampage is a rather odd game, I picked it up from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cheap. Best amount of money I have ever spent, this is a Niche title, meaning there is nothing else like it anywhere, apart from Real Life....Being a Human Male, I despize Cleaning and everything that Women are supposed to do in the house. But this, this makes Cleaning bloomin' hilariousFirstly you are told to Clean the Workshop, simple enough. But then comes the fun part. Being able to smear dead Elves all over the walls and showing them how to Paint the Town Red. You can also Blow Up Dynamite....and Molotovs. Which is ♥♥♥♥ING annoying. As the game progresses you start to feel sympathy for the people who did bad in their GCSE's and A-Level and are now Minimum Wage paid Janitors. But...you know, Elf Body Parts. The Fun thing is the Collectables. You can slap them in your Janitor's chest and hey presto! Easy Achievements. The other fun thing is the Elf Body Parts....didn't I mention that already? One of the main bad things in this entire game, IS THE MOP BUCKETS. Knocking these ♥♥♥♥ers over is like having to ask Valve to release Half-Life 3. Never going to happen. The other bad thing is the Knives. Sometimes they get stuck UNDERNEATH the floor. You have to cheat. To complete the game...sometimes. Frustration is the main aspect of this game. In Conclusion.

												The Holiday pressures have finally gotten to Santa--He's finally vented all those pent-up frustrations. Unfortunately for the elves, Santa wasn't to particular about who he took it out on! It's your job to put things to rights and boy, do you have job security! This one is a toughie. Lots of bodies, buckets of blood, and you'll need to be creative to reach those hard--to-reach places.  On the up side, you've got lots of bins to put trash in and lots of buckets of water so you can mop everything until they shine.... but every so often, if you are lucky, you will be given bloody body parts instead of a bin or a bucket of water. I say ""lucky"" because the alternative is a bundle of TNT and a lit fuse! Oh, and you might want to think about how you dispose of the sticks of dynamite and those ""cocktails"" Santa put together. You wouldn't want it to blow up in your face! Yeah, this one is a definite challange, with a Christmas theme for those of you who wish Christmas would never end!			"

												Meh! Pretty good game.... but not a lot to do. It is pretty fun whenever you have spare time over. Alone or not....It is fun to use commentary whilst playing this game. It was sort of worth 1.99£/20kr (The game is/was on sale). It is a small game and it is enjoyable. I reccommend this game but it will not have the best rating from me.... 5/10.			"

This game gets frusturating when you have a room cleaned then walk into a room with blood everywhere and walk out hile treading blood all over your previously cleaned room or when you spill a bucket of bllody water and have to clean it all backup. But worst of all is the dynamite... thats all I will say.			"

												Menial fun. That about sums up VCD: Santa's Rampage pretty well. There is a mess and you must clean it up. It's not 'fun' as in there's something to explore, or learn, or kill... But there is fun here. I find it only fitting that, after killing myriads of enemies myself, I am now the janitor cleaning up after someone else's mess. The dynamite adds a bit of excitement. However, the lack of voice acting really hinders the immersion. VCD: Shadow Warrior kept me playing because of the voiced humor. This title's janitor is silent. Also, there is bugs! I spent 2 hours cleaning the place to find out some objects had fallen through the floor, meaning I was not able to clock out and get my achievment. And that's what VCD is really all about, for me, achievments! No, the game isn't really all that fun, but it's not too terribly difficult to get all the achievments. This isn't a bad title either if you had a laptop that can run it, and your signifigant other forces you to sit and watch Glee or Scandal or Revenge (yes, this happens to me). For less than $2 VCD: Santa's Rampage is a good deal.			"

												I've had the pleasure of having the full Viscera package gifted to me, and I cherish this game a lot.Currently, I play Car Mechanic Simulator and KAMI when I want to relieve some stress and just relax. Viscera easily fits with those games (most of the time).The aesthetics are fantastic, the detail in Santa's Workshop is very well-done, and the blood splatter, various Elf bodies in random levels of dismemberment add to the grim atmosphere that you must attempt to clean up. The music and sounds are appropriate to the scenario - Christmas-themed, but still enough to get you a little pumped to do some hardcore cleaning. Also, if you would rather play without music, you can always pick up the radio and toss it in the fireplace (along with a piece of dynamite or two for good measure) The overall mess in the workshop is great, as you can walk around and recreate the carnage unleashed by Santa in your head. The controls are fairly straightforward, and playing will be easy if you've started with the original Viscera before this one. You can switch between three items - your hands for manipulating objects, your mop, and the sniffer (which lets you know if you've missed anything in your cleaning routine). When you pick up items, you can click the mouse to orient them in a default position (ex: elf bodies will be held up straight, making it easier to place them into the containers). The learning curve is minimal, since all you need to do is clean up the workshop; however, obtaining 100% achievement completion may take some extra work (and honestly some internet research since a few are very specific with a tiny window for error).The gameplay - for me at least - is very calming. You need to interact with two janitor machines - one provides you with buckets of water, while the other provides you with a hazardous waste container. The bucket creator will sometimes give you random elf body parts, potentially adding more mess to the immediate area.When you mop up blood, you get several wipes before your mop is too soaked, rendering it ineffective (mopping any surface will simply spread more blood). You will then have to wipe your mop in the water bucket (which can be used a total of 4 times before you need to get a new one). Note: the collision mechanics in this game are extremely sensitive (which I think they were going for), and you can accidentally tip over the bucket, splashing bloody gore all over the place. That being said, absolutely nothing is stopping you from doing a reverse-Cleanup Detail and spreading blood all over the place (as I am doing right now).I'm not crazy. Maybe just a tad bit.The hazardous waste container helps you collect the elf body parts, debris, and other junk. You can then carry them over to the fireplace to destroy them (the containers can also be destroyed if you leave them there). You can manually carry each item to the fireplace, however, since you can only hold one item at a time, this would take much longer. Be advised, since the collision mechanics are very sensitive, it is very, very easy to accidentally spill the contents of your container all over the place. If any elf body parts rubs against a surface, there is a very high chance it will spread blood all over the place.There is also a janitor lockbox where you can depost things like Santa's shotgun and other weapons. Be WARNED, the box seems to be extremely buggy (I call it Pandora's box), and I strongly recommend you DO NOT try to move it - you should even avoid trying to open/close it too much. I tried to move the box, and it propelled me all over the workshop. I learned my lesson and have no left it there every time.There is a fair amount of detail in the level, and you can even pick up and read some of the letters to Santa - some of which are pretty hilarious.While I was in my relaxing trance, I had a nice setup going - bloody buckets organized in clear areas, along with waste containers ready to be placed into the fireplace. I was not sure what to do with the assortment of dynamite sticks, so I dropped them into the bloody water buckets and placed everything in the fireplace. I picked up a nearby container and moved to place it inside as well.The dynamite promptly blew up, spreading blood and gore everywhere, and eradicating me instantly.I waited, and laughed when I respawned - I was given a briefing mentioning the incompetence of the previous janitor, with a note that I might possibly be promoted to full-time janitor if I did a good job (you can keep killing yourself).A really, really fun game. Check it out if you are interested at all.Highly recommend!If you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews "

This game might seem like some weird boring sim, but it's full of hidden gems and nods to pop culture.Play to unwind and explore the grubby world, go for the full 100% clean acheivements (actually can be difficult) or have a romp with friends that will ALWAYS run awry.

												A great game if you hate and like cleaning, elfs, weapons and random stuff.Once you think everything is clean the bucket dispenser decides to keep spitting out body parts so you can clean that up again. If you have friends, they will probably leave blood all over the place when they are walking or drag bloddy stuff all around the place, making the whole bloody place bloody again.Great with friends.

So you don't have to go through about 50 buckets for one room! haha.2- Cut the % that a limb will come out of a dispenser, It happens way too often, 5 times in a row in my last game =/ 3- Add Ladders!4- Add a broom/shovel for smaller bits! :P5- Add something like a saw to cut things into smaller pieces! 6- I dunno if its capable, but add randomly generated stuff, Right now, The game has no replay value.I have plenty more ideas to improve this game, but those are the main ones i believe should be seen to.Anyway, I recommend this game, but just keep in mind its the kinda game you just day dream in, its not fast paced, quite then opposite. Just also remember right now, There is no replay value to be had.:) 7/10			"

												Very fun, and cute. Cleaning out santas office, I see a couple bundles of TNT. Oh, ill dispose of it. The little sticks of TNT didnt do much, but it made a little mess... ill get rid of the rest all together!So after ive gathered the rest of the TNT I can find on the map, I throw it in a hazmat bin into the fire and back up.and it explodes.... much bigger than I thought.I died. I didnt even think you could die. Huh.So in comes my replacement, and I go to the water bucket machine. Better clean up myself, I suppose. I hear the machine grind, and expect a hand or chunk of meat to come out instead of water. Well, not exactly. Its another bundle of TNT. Lit. I die. Again.10/10 fun game			"

												I'm not going to lie, the workshop is a bloody mess. Mutilated elves and raindeer are found sticking to the walls and ceiling, with blood smeared all over the place. There are notes found in Santa's office and the platform upstairs detailing the back story before the masacure took place. Apparently he was being hit with hefty fines, which got to a point where he couldn't pay off his debts. On top of that he received notes from naughty children, who wanted specific things fromg him so they could do naughty things. There's also a note where Santa's wife, Mrs. Clause, stating that he was leaving him. The final note was apparently a receipt detailing the list of weaponry he bought.You'll have to remove the items on said receipt, basically burn them all in the fireplace, along with the dismemebered body parts of workers and raindeer. Every smudge, bloodstain, and soot must be cleaned from the workshop in order to get the achievement for cleaning up the mess. What you do after that is up to you.TL;DR:Awesome game, makes me wanna clean up my house.			"

												I picked up this game because my friend told me to and because the reviews were hilarious.I absolutely love this. Repeatedly pressing left click just to mop is actually alot of fun, and moving elf body parts to Santa's fire to burn them. It's hilarious knocking over your friend's bucket filled with blood right after he finished cleaning or accidentally blowing him up with dynamite and creating a big, gorey mess that you both to clean up, only to fling one of his arms behind a table to be found later. Finding Rudolf's nose, elf corpses used as throwing knife targets, letters to Santa, and even empty Jack Daniels rip off bottles called ""Spack Spaniels"" are hilarious little details. The writing is also hilarious, from the bios of your employee records to the spoiled kids sending letters to Santa. I really suggest getting this game because it's hilarious.			"

												This game is much more fun than it should be (now with much loved save function!) There's something satisfying about burning elf bodies in the fire and seeing the bloody mess wash away under your mop. Then again, it's also just as much fun to throw elf parts into a trunk and use all the leftover molotovs and dynamite to blow up what's still standing.  The ""story"" can be found in letters that you find, and all the flavor text and details just add to the experience. I clean more in this game than I clean in real life, and that's ok. Worth picking up, and I will definately be picking up the other Viscera Cleanup Detail games in the future!			"

												I've had the pleasure of having the full Viscera package gifted to me, and I cherish this game a lot.Currently, I play Car Mechanic Simulator and KAMI when I want to relieve some stress and just relax. Viscera easily fits with those games (most of the time).The aesthetics are fantastic, the detail in Santa's Workshop is very well-done, and the blood splatter, various Elf bodies in random levels of dismemberment add to the grim atmosphere that you must attempt to clean up. The music and sounds are appropriate to the scenario - Christmas-themed, but still enough to get you a little pumped to do some hardcore cleaning. Also, if you would rather play without music, you can always pick up the radio and toss it in the fireplace (along with a piece of dynamite or two for good measure) The overall mess in the workshop is great, as you can walk around and recreate the carnage unleashed by Santa in your head. The controls are fairly straightforward, and playing will be easy if you've started with the original Viscera before this one. You can switch between three items - your hands for manipulating objects, your mop, and the sniffer (which lets you know if you've missed anything in your cleaning routine). When you pick up items, you can click the mouse to orient them in a default position (ex: elf bodies will be held up straight, making it easier to place them into the containers). The learning curve is minimal, since all you need to do is clean up the workshop; however, obtaining 100% achievement completion may take some extra work (and honestly some internet research since a few are very specific with a tiny window for error).The gameplay - for me at least - is very calming. You need to interact with two janitor machines - one provides you with buckets of water, while the other provides you with a hazardous waste container. The bucket creator will sometimes give you random elf body parts, potentially adding more mess to the immediate area.When you mop up blood, you get several wipes before your mop is too soaked, rendering it ineffective (mopping any surface will simply spread more blood). You will then have to wipe your mop in the water bucket (which can be used a total of 4 times before you need to get a new one). Note: the collision mechanics in this game are extremely sensitive (which I think they were going for), and you can accidentally tip over the bucket, splashing bloody gore all over the place. That being said, absolutely nothing is stopping you from doing a reverse-Cleanup Detail and spreading blood all over the place (as I am doing right now).I'm not crazy. Maybe just a tad bit.The hazardous waste container helps you collect the elf body parts, debris, and other junk. You can then carry them over to the fireplace to destroy them (the containers can also be destroyed if you leave them there). You can manually carry each item to the fireplace, however, since you can only hold one item at a time, this would take much longer. Be advised, since the collision mechanics are very sensitive, it is very, very easy to accidentally spill the contents of your container all over the place. If any elf body parts rubs against a surface, there is a very high chance it will spread blood all over the place.There is also a janitor lockbox where you can depost things like Santa's shotgun and other weapons. Be WARNED, the box seems to be extremely buggy (I call it Pandora's box), and I strongly recommend you DO NOT try to move it - you should even avoid trying to open/close it too much. I tried to move the box, and it propelled me all over the workshop. I learned my lesson and have no left it there every time.There is a fair amount of detail in the level, and you can even pick up and read some of the letters to Santa - some of which are pretty hilarious.While I was in my relaxing trance, I had a nice setup going - bloody buckets organized in clear areas, along with waste containers ready to be placed into the fireplace. I was not sure what to do with the assortment of dynamite sticks, so I dropped them into the bloody water buckets and placed everything in the fireplace. I picked up a nearby container and moved to place it inside as well.The dynamite promptly blew up, spreading blood and gore everywhere, and eradicating me instantly.I waited, and laughed when I respawned - I was given a briefing mentioning the incompetence of the previous janitor, with a note that I might possibly be promoted to full-time janitor if I did a good job (you can keep killing yourself).A really, really fun game. Check it out if you are interested at all.Highly recommend!If you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews "

Apparently he was being hit with hefty fines, which got to a point where he couldn't pay off his debts. On top of that he received notes from naughty children, who wanted specific things fromg him so they could do naughty things. There's also a note where Santa's wife, Mrs. Clause, stating that he was leaving him. The final note was apparently a receipt detailing the list of weaponry he bought.You'll have to remove the items on said receipt, basically burn them all in the fireplace, along with the dismemebered body parts of workers and raindeer. Every smudge, bloodstain, and soot must be cleaned from the workshop in order to get the achievement for cleaning up the mess. What you do after that is up to you.TL;DR:Awesome game, makes me wanna clean up my house.			"

												Totally Love this game, Shows great detail in limbs and the blood is realistic... Over all this game deserves another feature and it is VERY under priced for how awesome the game truly is, if you want a nice and bloody game, Here it is :PI rate 11/10 You guys really over did it!

												A great game if you hate and like cleaning, elfs, weapons and random stuff.Once you think everything is clean the bucket dispenser decides to keep spitting out body parts so you can clean that up again. If you have friends, they will probably leave blood all over the place when they are walking or drag bloddy stuff all around the place, making the whole bloody place bloody again.Great with friends.

There's invisible stains that you have to hunt down, objects often glitch and fall trough the ground, etc. I've mopped every single surface, noclipped trough the ground to see if I didn't miss anything, nothing, but it's still not enough. Looking for that last single spot that's glitched takes more time than the actual cleaning.			"

												A darkly humorous little physics playground where you must clean up after Santa has finally had enough and snapped. Slowly the tale of a man who's taken too much, burdened by impossible bills, a deadbeat brother, and elf union activism, comes to light. Armed with a shotgun, knives, explosives, and way, way too much whiskey, Santa has laid terrible waste to his own workshop.And it's your job to fish pieces of elves out of the craziest places and throw them in the fire, while flailing with your mop at the bloodstains *everywhere*. And trying not to break any Christmas presents. Only to set off a leftover molotov cocktail by accident...Worth the buck I paid for it.7/10 provides scientific proof that I am far too easily entertained			"

Even thought it's a simulator game, which 90% of them are better watching when somebody's doing something ""funny"" or are starting to be bored after few hours, this game is short and even people who aren't into this genre will have fun. So, why it's perfect game? It's full of christmas theme! There is christmas tree, presents in every corner and stuff that need to be cleaned out, just like in real life! If you can ignore a fact that there are also pools of blood, dead bodies and some chopped reindeers, every christmas lover will have fun cleaning a Santa's place out! You don't like christmas? Oh, it's not a problem. Just burn everything. These little gnomes too.			"

												Scrub-a-dub-dub, three elf heads in a tub. If you aren't easily offended and have a sense of humor, this is a great game. If you are OCD, this is a great game. Clean blood, dispose of body parts. Simple. Fun. Time consuming. What more could you want?I recommend this game, because the humor and fun value I had playing it far outweighed my general $1/hour of gameplay required rule. Granted, I ended up playing it a second time with another friend, so I guess I did get more than the full value out of it, but I wouldn't expect to be playing this for more than an hour, so judge that how you will. If you buy Shadow Warrior, you get the Shadow Warrior version of it, which is better value, imo. The base game is also $8 base and is still being developed, with presumably multiple levels, unlike this one, so that might be the best bet. You can still pick this one up for cheap and see if you like it though.			"

Uhm... it is a good cleaning simulator game!I know you can't imagine playing a game where you have to clean, when you hate cleaning a huge mess in the real world. But the developers somehow made cleaning fun in this game! Even better and funnier with friends, because you can make a bigger mess, than the starting mess! "

												If you were considering getting the original Viscera Cleanup but dont want to spend all that money to try it, VCD:Santa's Rampage is a great way to test the game. It has all the mechanics of VCD, but with only one level and is way cheaper. All that being said, VCD is a really good game to blow way too much time on doing mindless chores. Its kinda funny how doing work in real life seems less rewarding			"

												I got this game on sale quite a while ago, played it with my sister and it was fun but it got tiring after a bit. It is a very unique idea: Santa went on a rampage and destoryed the house and made a very large mess, and you have to clean it up. If you've got a friend you want to play with, give it a shot and you'll have fun for a few hours. Solo it can get pretty boring and I'm not sure if that's worth it. Really the only bad thing game play wise is that it does glitch some of the containers sometimes and everything you picked up gets thrown out around the room, and sometimes something that you need to clean gets glitched out of the map so you can never get 100% competed game. Unless you really do require getting 100% though it's not completely necessary to do that go have a good time with it.I'd say as long as you know what you're going into: a cleanup game without and story, just picking up bits and pieces and trashing them, then you'll enjoy it.

												This game is strangely addicting - I logged about 4 hours on my first playthrough, yet all you really do is clean.  Still, it's fun and pretty entertaining to play as you figure out what exactly happened there.  Definitely addicting for anyone who's mildly OCD, and I'd highly recommend for just a couple dollars!

												For those who haven't had a chance to play any variation of this glorious game, now is a better time than any. Besides the original alpha (which is still up for download on the dev's website) this is the only official independent release of the game. There was one that came with Shadow Warrior as well, and I can imagine that one is just as fun.First of all, yes, this game is a joke. That's the point. It's witty, it's sarcastic, the concept is amazingly silly, but it's an extraordinary amount of fun. For a game that may as well have been titled ""Janitor Simulator 2013"", I think this game has given me more pleasure for $2.49 than at least half the big brand games out there have on sale.Don't get me wrong. This is a fairly one and one kind of game. I'm not saying the appeal will last forever. But with it's 13 achievements and cheap sale price, you can get at least 3 or 4 hours of fun out of this game. Not only that, but supporting it means you're providing the funds for the developers to keep making more. As we've already seen with Shadow Warrior, this medium provides the potential for dozens of parodies.Viscera Cleanup Detail runs on the Unreal Engine 3, which means that any of game running on the Unreal Engine 3 has the potential of being ported easily for this game. This list includes, but is not limited to: Bioshock Infinite, Alice: Madness Returns, Borderlands 1 & 2, Deadpool, Dishonored, Devil May Cry, Mass Effect, Sanctum, Section 8, THIEF, Tribes: Ascend, XCOM, Outlast, Xeno Clash II, and on and on and on the list goes!And for each game you could have different interactions and achievements, possibly even hard mode scenarios where you have to work around the NPCs that are there, such as cleaning up around workers in the slums of Finkton, or having to clean up around the club goers on Omega while being able to interact with the local barman. The potential for this game is all but endless.My point is if you haven't had a chance to play this hilarious game, do so. Go and download the Alpha off their website (Google it ya bums!) and if you like it, spend the $2.49 and support the creators. I would very much like to see more of this game in the future.			"

												This game is not for everyone. It takes forever just to clean up one room and it's very frustrating toppling buckets of water over or spreading even more blood across the floor because you didn't realize your mop had gotten that dirty yet, ruining your last hour of work. However, once you get into the swing of things it does get easier. Not bad considering the price.			"
