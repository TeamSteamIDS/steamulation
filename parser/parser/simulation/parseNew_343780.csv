												I think many phone games should just stay on their tiny little screens, but there are some I've enjoyed on PC.  I really want to make some witty comment like Cat Goes Fishing has me hooked, but I really don't feel that strongly about it.  It's fun, in a casual, play a bit here and there way, which seems to be the phone game mantra.     Cat Goes Fishing does take a bit of strategy, as you have to use smaller fish to catch larger ones, while trying to get the bait to the fish you want to catch.  This layered approach to baiting fish may seem tricky at first, but keep at it and in no time you'll be a master baiter. "

												I knew ""one more round"" syndrome before, but now I know also ""one more fish"" syndrome.When you look at those screenshots, you're thinking: that game is not for me. I thought so too, and now I can't stop playing.VERDICT:Even if you think you don't like such games, you should try that. You may be surprised.Like this review?

												This is an adorable game that looks casual on the surface but does actually have a deceptive depth of gameplay. Well, as much gameplay as you can get with a single cat click. It's cute, it's fun and in a few minutes play you'll be hooked. After playing WoW for so many years, I never thought I'd admit to fishing being enjoyable but this game really lured me in. With a bit of purrsuasion in the form of different baits, you catch the fish and sell them for money or use them as ever increasing temptations to catch bigger and betta fish whilst warding off hordes of hungry tiddlers. Did I mention your cat can wear hats? Purrfect. You don't need to be a brain sturgeon to realize this is worth buying - it only costs a few squid!(To all my friends and family, please forgive me for posting this. You could say... this is an apawlogy. Don't hate me.)			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a game that mixes with a pin-point precision the essence of actual fishing into a fun experience for players of all ages and game genres. Despite its repetitive game play, it is perfectly capable of showing diversity and new content as you play and progress without losing its fun or its certain realism to actual fishing!The strong aspects in this gameDiversity:Despite the game being about a repetitive subject such as fishing, Cat Goes Fishing is perfectly capable of showing a diversity allied with its vast content variety as you progress and discover.Music:The music in this game is a good match to the game overall environment and also to the interaction between players and the game itself giving a very comfortable feeling of relax and pleasure.Difficulty:The difficulty in this game adds up to the initial mentioned realistic fishing experience. As you catch different types of fish, they will struggle against you while testing your patience and coordination making players feel as if they were actually fishing or playing a game dedicated only to fishing realism.Price:I don’t usually talk about the price in games unless they are unfair, but I must say the amount of fun and entertainment this game has to offer makes it reasonable at its current price of 6,99€.Game mechanics and user interface:Both game mechanics and user interface are simple, and perfectly suitable with the game structure and its game play that it provides to players.Now to the weaker aspectGraphics: The game graphically talking, deserves a lot more action and detail into it, as it makes players feel like there is something the game is lacking of, and that is precisely the non-existence of simple water splashes among others easily making players into thinking that the game shows an obvious enormous potential, but lacks good graphics or animations into it making it look more like a flash game rather than a Steam game.ConclusionI would rate this game a 67 out of 100 or 3,3 out of 5,0.  An interesting cute game able to provide tons of fun and moments of joy without losing its challenge or fun core in it!			"

												Okay I will be the first to admit that people slap Cat on to something and call it a day and it sells like hot cakes. It has become almost a trend in gaming to put a Cat or funny animal into an unusual role and forget the importance of game design. When it comes to Cat Gone Fishing, the adorable aesthetic aside. The game is very well designed and highly addictive. Yes, it's a cat holding a fishing rod and it is adorable but that aside the core gameplay of Cat Goes Fishing is what I enjoyed most about this game. With dozens of upgrades available for your rod, boat, radar and more, you will turn your Cat into a fishing machine as you begin to battle the monsters underneath the surface. Cat Goes Fishing is a wonderful game to just load up and completely just fall into and relax while you play it, discovering even more aquatic animals after you think you've found everything. The only true complaint I could have about the game is it's lack of options, Cat Goes Fishing shows its mobile roots with no shame. While this may be disconcerting to some, I found the positives of this fun and adorable game to far outweigh the bad. Besides, guys, it's a Cat wearing a hat and fishing! Come on! It's adorable!!I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												Tags : Casual - Object FlingerCat goes Fishing is a very casual and relaxed sidescrolling fishing simulation. Under the cartoony art direction and streamlined controls you still have a variety of factors affecting gameplay, including depth of water, distance from shore, rod style and modifications, baits, and different outfits affecting perks. You get short term goals that when completed give additional rewards which helps you unlock more content faster. The game is suprisingly addictive, and its easy to zone out clicking away mindlessly while listening to radio. Overall I would say this is a nice pick, I spent a lot of time unlocking things, until at some point it became too repetitive to continue, but still once in a while it is nice to pick up and pick a couple of fishes, but at that point it has little more to offer than your average tablet game.

			Cat Goes Fishing PC Gameplay [60FPS] http://store.steampowered.com/app/343780/ Subscribe & comment to see more: http://bit.ly/seph_au Focus on steam games, indies and early access. No nonsense.		

Starting as cat with a basic rod the controls are simple, you can play this with one hand. Fishing up the smaller species initially and selling them will reward you with money, which is used for purchase of better rods or upgrades to current equipment. The game then introduces you to it's quest system, completing these tasks rewards larger sums of money. While questing the fish catalog becomes useful as it will display all species in the game.Sometimes fishing in the depths you may discover rare hats, which not only look cute on cat but give large bonuses to both your fishing abilities and values of catches. More tongue in cheek one-use items available later include rockets and bombs but everything has it uses. In these cases scaring away packs of fish or making your cast go much further with cheaper rods. Boat travel is also included, but I have not progressed that far yet.Content wise, If you check the store page the developer mentions and I quote.""Regular updates will bring new fish, boats, hats, and entirely new mechanics to the game, extending your experience and offering new ways to master the game. ""Addictive and enjoyable for all ages. Easily recommended. @developerOnly downside is the music, decent enough but maybe think about adding some more variety in future. :)			"

												Well, this is a surprisingly fun game. It looks exactly like it's shown on the product page and plays exactly as you might imagine. You simply cast and reel, upgrade as you earn cash from fish caught, finish quests (which might be catch x number of this type of fish, cast this far, this deep, etc...). That is basically it. Although it is one of the most simplistic, basic games I have ever played, it's ability to provide a very fun, casual experience is almost peerless. Cats love fish, so wouldn't this be fun, right?That is pretty much it. Try it. You are almost guaranteed to enjoy it, and it will provide a nice break for when you aren't sure what else you want to play or just don't feel like playing anything else.Shockingly 10 out of 10!!! Brilliant in it's simplistic nature, charming, addictive.			"

												This is a ridiculously cute and relaxing game.  Cute and relaxing does not also mean boring, however.  There's always things to work towards (catching certain fish, acquiring new gear, etc.). I was honestly surprised that there's enough to strive for in Cat Goes Fishing to keep me interested.  The amount of money you earn is reasonable for what you catch/how difficult the fish is to catch, and you earn it at a good rate, too.  This means when you're eyeing that $50,000 boat, it won't be days until you have it; you will probably be able to earn the cash in half an hour, 45 minutes (or less if you don't purchase certain items that enhance your casting, like rockets. Zoom!)Finally, the music is simple and pretty, and rounds out the relaxing gameplay perfectly. For under $7.00, it is well worth the purchase.			"

												The main thing going for Cat Goes Fishing is the art.Fishing is, in reality, tedious and a waiting game. Unlike other reviewers, I'm not one to fault the game for being ""grindy"".Players will notice, the object of this fishing game is more to attempt to keep your bait safe so you can get the fish you are after to bite.The upgrades cost crazy in-game currency prices as that is the typical way of handling upgrades in this genre of game. Eventually everything is bought, all things are caught/collected,  and thus there is a wall.I would not recommend this game as there is no innovation. This is a free flash game style of game.To make matters worse, there is no full screen, no selectable resolutions, no aduio level adjustment for the single track OST that plays constantly.This is a dollar mobile app type game not worth the asking price of several times that.Mechanically it works. Artistically it looks good. But it's plain and lacking in simple features and innovation.			"

„Cat Goes Fishing“ is surprisingly fun, especially with the simple game-mechanics and the relaxing music it has.You start the game as a simple cat, that – of course – goes fishing. Because every cat likes fish, right? In „Cat Goes Fishing“ you have to level up to achieve different things. You will get a shop quite early in the game to make it possible and upgrade your rods. By time, you will also be able to purchase things such as rockets or bombs to apply on your fishing rod. Later in the game you will be buying a boat to move into the depths of the ocean, getting even more rare fish than you got at the shore. The more money you make, the better upgrades and items you can buy. And during this process, you will level up and unlock several new things that will improve your gameplay. The game has 52 achievements to collect, most of them seem easy to achieve since they are bound to the quests you get in the game (hunting several fish, buying a special item), but a lot are also harder to get. Also, you will find two modes to play on. First one is normal, where you simply catch fish, sell them, level up. In realism mode, the fish will try to withstand when getting pulled out of the water. They won't make it far, most of them will get eaten by bigger fishes in the underground, so you will receive less money once you try to sell your prey.Overall, this game is nice to spend some time on, either when installing something else or just chilling out. It can possibly get addictive, especially when you like cats and fishing (?), but in the end it's just a short little game with more achievements than spectacular gameplay.			"

Cat Goes Fishing is a casual, cat-induced, 2-D fishing ‘simulator.’ The goal here is to use an array of tools, including rods, boats, even bombs in conjunction with upgrades to complete a host of quests.The casting mechanics are fairly straightforward, as there are only three buttons you’re likely to ever use. Click for casting/reeling & A/D for movement. There is no tutorial as of the writing of this review, but getting the general sense on how to start casting to maximum effect is quite simple. There isn’t any Menu either. While, the casting & movement mechanics couldn’t get any simpler, there is some depth on how you choose to complete the quests. There are many different types of effects you can apply to your rod to target or dissuade various types of fish or to augment other elements. There are also tools both temporary & permanent that will come in handy.As you catch fish & complete quests, you will level & accrue currency. As you level, the quests get progressively more difficult. However, from my experience, there does appear to be a degree of randomness with respect to the quest system; old quests will pop up time & again. The quests will progressively get more & more grindy. Completing them will require you to farm currency for pro-longed periods of time, before you can purchase the necessary items & upgrades to complete them.Hats! Hats! & More Hats! Yes, Cat Goes Fishing does have an array of hats. They are obtained by catching them so keep an eye out. The sad part is that you can’t collect them. You can only wear one hat at a time. Each hat provides a useful boost. Be wary of accidentally selling a hat, as it is easy to do. There is an in-game catalog giving various details on the different types of fish, so it may yield some assistance in catching your desired fish.The artwork is exactly as shown in the screenshots. The background scenery is under-utilized & quite bland. The sound is one uninspiring track looped continuously. Luckily, it can be muted with the ‘M’ key.In conclusion, I wouldn’t label Cat Goes Fishing as a fishing simulator. I wouldn’t recommend it to those who love fishing & desire that experience, albeit through the eyes of a cat. Rather, Cat Goes Fishing is a game you pop in when you have a few minutes to kill, just for the posterity of seeing a cat catch some fish, while wearing a snazzy hat.			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a fun and relaxing fishing game where you take control of a Cat (never would have guessed) who's trying to catch the biggest fish he/she can. The game is still being worked on by its developer (I think) so hopefully the game's negative aspects will be ironed out soon.+Simple graphics+Lots of upgrades to equipment and lots of new equipment can be unlocked as you progress through the game+Quite a lot of different fish types+You can 'catch' hats which give you special perks or can be sold for a small profit+Great game for killing time and it's very relaxing+The game autosaves when you quit so you don't have to worry about saving the game all the time+Catching a big fish that you've been after for a while is very satisfying+You can unlock boats which allow you to travel further from the shore and catch more expensive fish-Progression in the game is slow and painful, earning enough money for the hugely expensive fishing rods and other equipment take very long times-Hats can't be saved, if you get a new one you have to pick-Little fish can eat medium and large bait (you can get a rod upgrade to stop them eating large bait) which is incredibly frustrating-Some of the fishing rod upgrades feel like they have no effect-This game has no options of any kind and is stuck in 1024x768 making it look pretty bad on big screens when in full screen (full screen can only be achieved by using ALT+ENTER)-Quests are dull and repetitiveVerdict:6A reasonably fun casual fishing game that is best played in short bursts to kill some time.El K.

												What a surprising little gem.The mechanics are simple: just click to cast and hold to reel in!The artwork, while almost elementary, is cute, clean, and consistent. It serves the purpose well; simple and cute artwork for a simple and cute game.Despite the simplicity of the controls, there is actually a perfect amount of difficulty instituted here. You've got to craftily avoid smaller fish to get to the bigger ones, or combo the smaller ones as bait for larger and larger fish. The better the fish, the more money you get for them. Money is spent on an assortment of fishing rods, powerups for each rod, boats, and even extras like one-use bombs and larger hooks. The balance in the game seems perfect; even hours later, I'm still catching new fish and have only unlocked half the rods and boats and powerups, and I'm still getting new quests for bonus money.Oh, and you can catch adorable hats for your cat to wear which give different bonuses!The only thing I can't seem to find is an options menu, but the sounds and music are so unobtrusive that for most people it might not matter much.

												Other than yarn, cats love fish! So instead of this cat waiting on it's master to give it fish, it'll give itself fish by fishing!This is a game that's more about the atmosphere, casual play, and steady pacing. Not intended for rushing through the content, but to cast your line and hope you get a big one. The music is soothing and relaxing as well.There is some strategy in play here, whether it's to lure or avoid fish, or try to get a specific fish. Be sure to keep an eye on your money too and try to make a profit per fish or load of fish. Buy a boat or better rods for bigger fish. Can even modified your rods for your own benefit.The price is good, but wouldn't hurt to wait for a sale either.Cat is gonna have a feast when he's done with this pond!Try your luck in realism too!-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Cute little light weight game. Perfect for killing time while you wait for something.Tons of fish to catch.Tons of rods and upgrades for them.Tons of little extras, like hats. They offer perks! Usually discounts, which is awesome!Quests, lots of them. Lots of repeats, but what to you expect for a game like this? The quests rewards help you regardless, so it doesn't matter.I... Recommend it.			"

There are many kinds of fishes swimming in different areas. So if you go with quests or catching them all there is little bit challenge as well. Also there is some extra fishing stuff that you can buy using money from selling fishes. And a lot of achivements to get.			"

The best part is the attachments because it makes fishing for certain fish easier and making THOSE STUPID SMALL FISH FROM EATING THE BIG FISH BAIT.  Anyways, its a great game but it gets me more angry than CSGO....			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a very relaxing fishing game. The fishing is very well though out in which you start out upgrading your fishing rod and then move on to buying a boat to get to deeper waters.The game offers a very unique physics for the casting which help you cast either very far or just right in front of you. You always start with small bait and must catch a small fish then recast to catch a medium fish with which you can catch most large fish but some fish have certain requisites to catch them. (like using a puffer with a large hook to catch the swordfish). We also see the sadness of overfishing with one of the species in the game. If you fish a certain species they will be extinct. The visuals are very simplistic and colorful. The vast mayority of the fish are very distinguishable by their color and shape. The sounds and music are very well made. The underwater sounds resonate with the depth that your in and the music on the surface is quite tranquile. All in all you have a simplistic fishing game that is nice and tranquile for those afternoons when you just need to space out. Rod in one hand, a joint in the other.8/10 for making me wanna live on the sea.			"

												I seem to have embraced the cat who loves fishing quite well.Calming, repetitive, mindless, amusing - pretty much a great way to pass time. I'm sure it'll be more exciting once I actually catch a hat and am able to explore further though. And at least it doesn't feel too much of a grind at the beginning leading up to that.			"

Catch them and eat them or throw them back as bait and catch bigger fish to consume. The graphics are very simple making the fish even more enjoyable when you capture them and their families. The leveling system amazing in the way you get rewarded for slaughtering your opponents. Overall this game deserves game of the year for the next century. 10/10 Perfect game.			"

												My land, this game is more addicting than it has any right to be.  It actually requires skill despite its one-button mechanic.  Every hat. lure, rod, upgrade, and fish changes the most basic rules of what you can catch.  At the time I'm writing this, you can pay $4 at Groupees and get it with a bunch of other decent games.  Otherwise I'd say that $3 or less is a sweet spot for this kind of procrastination aid.			"

												Unsurprisingly you are a cat and you are fishing: you'll start from the bank and slowly buy upgrades, new poles and even boats with the money you get from selling fish you catch.Cat Goes Fishing is a pretty charming game with a cute premise, decent gameplay and a good amount of stuff to do: sadly it can get repetitive fast and its progression is a tad too slow.PROS:-while very simple the graphics sport a charming art style-good amount of different fish to catch-quite many upgrades, things to buy and hats providing bonuses to be fished out of the water-two different game modes, one being more laid back while the other features a breakable lineCONS:-simple music gets repetitive quite fast-quests can't be abandoned, thus if you get one requiring a fish you can't/ aren't able to catch you're going to get stuck for a possibly long time-gameplay can get frustrating, even with upgrades having to cast in the right place, wiggling your lure between useless fish, hoping the right one will be hooked and that no other fish will take a bite while you reel it in can be challenging: having to do so several times and failing will teste your nerves and ruin the relaxing atmosphere the game wants to create-unlocks eventually get too pricey, requiring lots of grinding-no way to save and exchange hats, you can only equip one and have to sell those you don't wish to keep -some things aren't explained, for example what the different fishing pole stats actually do


Cat Goes Fishing 
A Screenshot of Cat Goes Fishing
By: stranger1982




Cat Goes Fishing is a decent game overall, I had fun for a few hours trying to catch fish, getting a nice hat, unlocking stuff and then trying to get a shark eat my bait: it's charming, has novelty value and can easily make you go ""just one more fish before I quit"".Sadly all this eventually grinds to a halt when you realize that the high end upgrades are very pricey, we're talking about a range from 250k to 320k when many big fishes can be sold for 7k: add to this the fact that you'll often have to also buy one time bonuses (rockets to go deeper, bombs to scare away the first fish that bites etc) not to mention having to rebuy upgrades for each new pole and you'll see how this can eventually get tiring.I was a bit torn overall but ultimately decided for a thumbs up due to the fact I had some decent fun with it and the game will do the same for you  for at least a few hours provided you don't mind its shortcomings, just don't be surprised when it loses its charm: if you're interested I'd get it on sale.

The quests definitely give the game some direction. With the ability to upgrade your rods and buy new attachments, Cat Goes Fishing can last a player for a long while and is replayable. I highly recommend the game to anyone who likes simpler indie games, flash games, or visual narratives rather than platformers.			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is intresting and addictive game. It offers casual and relaxing gameplay same time with challenge and intuitive gameplay. You start with a basic rod but soon you can play around with different hats, boats and rod upgrades and use them to create unique playstyles. CGF also has one of the best steam achievements, they offer difficulty while steal being reasonable to get, best achievements in whole steam. At first this game might look too simple minded and made for kids only, but don't let it fool you, i used to think like that too.I myself who tend to like more complex things actually got a bit addicted to it. I recommend this game, totally worth it to pick from sales.			"

												Cute and relaxing fishing game.You sell your fishs and complete quests (""Fish x of a specific fish"" or ""Buy this"" or ""Cast/sink your line over X meters"") to gain money and buy upgrades (fishing rod, baits, radar, boat to fish further). The value of each fish also gives you some experience to level up and unlock other upgrades.Also you can find some hats which give you some bonus (and a malus in addition sometimes) like one more quest, more value on some fishs, reduced cost on baits etc..Fairly easy to earn all achievements in roughly 12 hours with some RNG on the questsEdit for the update:The last update brings a ""Realism"" mode, a little bit less relaxing but more challenging. It means fish will struggle and your line can break. The update also brings new fish and new achievements.So even better than before.			"

												This such a wonderful game. It may seem very simple at the start, but as you play, you unlock new rods, upgrades, boats, and fish! There are hours of content in this game as you progress, get better equipment, and learn all the locations and behavior of the different fish in the game. Especially with this update that introduces the day-night cycle (which you unlock when you hit a certain level), there are a lot of things to explore in this game. It can be played casually, but it also has Realism Mode for those who want a bit of a challenge. I would recommend this game to everyone and anyone who likes a good fishing game. Bonus points for the cat doing a little meow when they catch a fish. :3TL;DR: You are a cute cat who catches a million fish and earns sweet monies and swaggy hats.			"

That feeling that, something important is missing in your life.This game, this game is why that feeling exists. You'll live you're whole life having that feeling of emptiness about you, never knowing what it takes to fill the void. Then you sit down and start playing Cat Goes Fishing, and it's like BLAM,   EPIPHANY . Everything that was wrong in the world is now right. As far as you're concerned around you is suddenly perfect. There is no more hunger, because Fishing Cat, (from henceforth his name is Charlie, don't ask me why, just is), will catch enough fish to feed the millions. Disease? Who cares? War? What of it? BOREDOM!? Nah, none of that is an issue with Charlie. Just sit yo' butt down, pull up a chair and prepare for the awe inspiring, once-in-a-lifetime, jaw-dropping experience that is Cat Goes Fishing.

 Noob Review	(The view point of this game from a person who never plays video games, my brother.)  The Game: Cat Goes Fishing       Music divine, cats behind. At first I felt like a fish out of water for this game, but after serval attempts it made quite the splash. This game, in its simplest form, is purrfect. With all the games these days, death is a constant, and it seems like you need nine lives. It’s good to play a game that the only death is of the aquatic amphibious. Don't get a hairball, keep trying and this game will be like a cat’s meow. Overall rating of a scale 1 to 11. 5, average, right in the middle  ._. Gamer Review	(The view point of a person who plays video games) Pros:	+Lots of fish+Relaxing+Lots of upgrades Cons:	- It feels like a game that your could get for free.Cat Goes Fishing is a nice game where you can spend sometime and catch some cool fish. I suggest to get it on discount. The video that plays when you go to the store page shows what the game is. It's exactly like that. You will love it or find it boring but if you are into these types of game than get it and enjoy.I would not give this a thumbs up or down it's more of a neutral thumb, but I am nice so I would give it a thumbs up.This was Curated for PC Beta Gaming if you would like to follow us the link is below: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/PC-BetaG#curationIf you liked this review please give it a thumbs up. This review is just my opinion, and if you disliked it or thought I could have done something better please leave a comment. Thank you for reading my review.

												Who wouldn't like a hat wearing cat that can secure his own dinner? It's a super fun and super cute game! It's a quick, no brainer, casual experience that fills the the need to play a game when you don't have enough time to play one. I still haven't mastered how to properly fling my rod though. A few times I'm able to make the thing really fly out there but I don't  know how to replicate that. But I'm still able to catch the fish I want, provided the other dumb fisH don't get to it first. :P Luckily, there are upgrades you can buy to keep those pesky fish at bay. :) Speaking of upgrades, that's another dynamic of the game I like. You can complete quests AND score some cash by catching fish. With that cash you are able to buy a better rod, an upgrade so your boat can leave dock, and other random things like a rocket to shoot your line out farther. It keeps the game interesting without needing it to be interesting. I give this game a thumbs up and a good recommendation for those that are really into mindless fun.			"

												This is more than just a simple game about a cat that decides to go fishing. This is the coming of age tale that follows a cat that breaks the stigma. She looks her ""owners"" in their eyes and refuses their handouts. Taking pole in hand she starts at the shore. With patience ironed, and ready for whatever may happen, she waits. I will not spoil the game any further except to say that she is rewarded in her endeavors. This feline goes on a journey of the spirit, body and mind only to return as more. I assure you that you will enjoy the adventure of Cat Goes Fishing as much as I. It's filled with ups and downs, but share the superb dialogue and struggles of Cat for something truly unique. 10/10 would fish with Cat again.			"

												To start, love this game.The appearance is clean, crisp, colorful and easy on the eyes even after long periods of game play. Even the fact it is windowed doesn't bother me! This is a very pleasant and easy going game (though can be sort of frustrating when trying to catch specific fish!) that isn't confusing and yet has a decent amount of depth for it's simplicity.The cat that goes fishing is cute in all of the little hats you unlock throughout the game, each giving you a bonus to some random fishing affect (small fish worth more, rockets cost less, etc). There are different kinds of rods that also have bonuses that you can pay to get equipped to them (such as faster lure sink). There are a few other fun features that give this game a playful, meaningful and yet simple to understand, feel that can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone.If you are looking for a relaxing game that doesn't cause you to obsessively keep track of every detail, a game that helps you unwind from a hectic day, this might be for you.If you are looking for a game that has mild strategy, a fishy smell and a furry protagonist, this is for you.If you broke your thumb and two fingers on your left hand, no worries. You only need to press A and D with that hand and have your right for the mouse!There's surprisingly quite a bit packed into this little package and it's definitely worth the (sale) price I paid for it. Especially the sense of pride and accomplishment as your cute little kitty reels in a monster shark.After all that, the only fault I have found in this whole game is the fact I can't upgrade the upgrades to my pole. But it isn't a drawback really, just expected it to be an extended feature and was surprised it wasn't. ^^It -can- get repetitive, but I enjoy that sort of gameplay just as much as I like gameplay with constant changes. But just a heads up for those who get tired of a bit of repetition.			"

												At the price point offered for this game, I don't think it's worth the time & money to get this game.The experience and gameplay is indeed challenging. It requires a little bit of reflex, planning and skill to overcome the missions/objectives. You'll get frustrated when the medium/large fishes start biting in on your haul, as you reel in your hard-earned fish to sell, only to find it missing a tail.Pretty straight-forward, and the fish do not relatively move a large distance, so you can expect the same cluster of fish to be hanging out in the same areas. Once you memorize their approximate locations, it becomes less of a random experience like how real-life fishing is, but becomes repetitive execution.Can probably be improved. I had fun, I don't deny that, but at the price, I think other titles within the same genre offer a better experience than this one, albeit being unique.			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a marvellously cute casual game.The gameplay is mostly catching fish and selling them, upgrading to catch bigger fish, repeat.This might sound boring but it is executing wonderfully well, as there are many paths you can make for the same result.Catch lots of small fish, or risk using the small fish as bait to catch big fish?This gameplay is brillant when combined with the adorable visuals and the calming music. These components formed make a wonderful game that is great for passing time.It has a cat. Who wouldn't want a game with a cute little kitty?			"

												All jokes aside I would rate this game a solid 9.8/10. This game is fantastically zen and is great for stress relief. You can play it for 5 minutes or 2 hours. I have found myself immersed in 2-3 hour sessions of this wonderful indie title. Pros: - The art style is a perfect blend of cartoon and realism.- The quests, although some can be extremely difficult, present a nice balance of challenge, objective, and progression.- The developers are quick to patch bugs or errors and pay close attention to what the community has to offer. For examle, I posted a screenshot to show my friends that I had snagged my first legendary hat. I expressed that I felt that hat was slightly nerf. Within a week a developer had commented saying that next patch they would buff it. - The AI for the fish is so well build. Each one of the 40+ fish in the game have a unique fighting style when hooked. Also, some fish travel together, chase eachother, and some will protect their ""leader."" I would like to write more about the AI but it would take hours.- The game progression is layed out perfectly, the larger, and harder to catch fish are father out at sea which requres the player to buy a boat, stronger fish are deeper, which requres the player to buy a better rod. The prices are layed out perfectly so when you dont get all the rods, then all the boats, air vice versa. Cons: - The music can get a little repetitive, but this can easily be fixed. EDIT 1: Hat for new music was added :DTo be honest there arent that many cons :) Suggestions - I feel this game could improve visually by adding in more customization options. These could include rod colors, boat, colors, boat names.- Lastly, on realism mode I think a day night cycle could be cool. EDIT 1: Added For 6.99 this game is 100% worth it!  "

												You know for such a goofy premise this game has a pretty decent amount of substance Take your usual fishing game, except not only do you play as a cat (I hope you figured that out already) but hunt for colorful, fictional fish.  It's quite fun, and the game gives you plenty of things to do in the quest for sea food, including quests and upgrades to seek out.On the other hand, catching a specific fish can be very mildly irritating sometimes,  and you also have to dodge a crapton of fish in order to get the bigger fish, though there are semi-reliable ways to get around this.It's dirt cheap so if you're bored I'd recommend it.

												tl;dr:  I PLAYED IT ALL NIGHT.  IT WAS BETTER THAN 'CATS.'  I WILL PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.---Outstanding game. Worth Every Single Penny. I will never regret having this game in my library (you know those feels). Balanced and extremely challenging. Resigns Gold Rush Classic and SEGA Bass Fishing to the history books.One can also acclimate onself to The Cute Factor and tune it out over time; this is extremely important for gameplay after-the-sale.""Dude, like, I almost had a maw. It was so awesome. It was, like, this big, but got away. No, really!""---My two gameplay beefs are that:1) One should be able to collect hats. Hats are nearly impossible to grab as the game progresses, much like Those Last Pets In Faerie Solitaire That Take Literally Millions Of Dollars And Gameplay Weeks To Acquire. A Perfect Game should be plausible and reflect skill and passion, not OMMFG I Have No Life Nor Family; Please Unfriend Me Now, Lest I Ever Chat With You.One can also permanently regret a split-second decision for the rest of the game's life, just like Damnit I Shouldn't Have Dropped That Shotgun Back There, in Borderlands 2. 2) The Great rod sets one back about $350K (with mods) before it becomes useable; this is too big of a gap. Bridging this gap is definitely a yellow flag to I Have No Life (see above)			"

												100/10 Kawaii. Best game on steam I have ever played. Disregarding the time recorded on it as this review, This game is absolutely amazing. The soundtrack sends me into a hypnotic state and when I actually come to I realize I am a cat fishing. I love this so much, also with cats being my favorite animal. What could be better? Worth the money, would buy 100 times over.			"

												This anime has some of the strongest character development I have ever seen,  the dub is seccond to girls und panzer, and it is probably my favorite anime besides king of the hill.Cat Goes Fishing is about the struggle of one cat and his quest to catch fish. As we start out the cat is just a simple prolitarean in a capitalist society. He sees the error of his society's ways and wants to rise up with his fellow workers against the oppressive corperate regeme he is living in. His father, who faithfully served for Whiskerslovakia as a boat millitarycat (also known as the navie) in the war against the hunter dogs, but was executed in the great fishpression of '92. After years of resenting his father, cat finally learned why his father was executed: ""he was a scapegoat for it all"" his revolutionary friend meowthew told him, and both of them should form a revolution against Whiskerslovakia.At a rally that cat and meowthew organized, police turned on the demonstrators and stated executing people in the streets. Meowthew died in cat's arms and cat found himself alive, not as an act of mercy, but to bear the suffering of his now dead best friend. Cat went back to his normal life and did not engage in any revolutionary activity until as the sole survivor of the riots he was approached by Mr. Meowgi, an old friend of his father. This is the last connection he had with his family, as his mom had died after childbirth. Mr. Meowgi gives cat a fishing rod, and cat was finally ready to accept his quest.Cat now knows he has has to leave. Our hero moves to the underground of the capital, Meowscow, and joins the underground resistance, leaving behind his girlfriend of five years, Sameowa. They were good together at first, but they had recently been going through trouble, and both were too busy to break things off. In the capital, his first assignment was to sabotauge regime fishing boats. Although a dangerous task, cat and his father before him were white cats, so they could easily blend in with the snow of Meowscow in Whiskerslovakia. Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha, a black cat, was also assigned to the mission, but she never made it to the boat. Instead, Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha was brutally beaten and captured. We can't be sure if she was captured for being a meowmber of the rebellion, or just for being black in an all white and calico society. This was the second time Cat saw the true face of his enemy. He successfully infultrated and sabotauged the boat, and soon forgot (three days max) Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha. After all, it's a cat kill cat world. Cat returns and recieves his sweet payment of catnip, and spends it on new armor for himself and an upgraded version of his fishing rod.Cat had overcame his trials and was now ready to fully face his enemy. He leads a ride into the city to assassinate a senetor, Wood. Cat had found out that Senetor Wood was the one who captured Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha, and had eventually killed her. Cat was ready for his vengance. Cat had now reached the senetor, and was prepared for an epic fight. All of his platoon was killed except for him, who completed his mission, and returned with newfound condidence that he could now face his true enemy, the ultamate evil, President Raftdog, who is actually a cat and not my English professer. With his mind set and his heart pure, he entered the Impurrial Meowice. Cat was surprised about how little people were on guard at the meowice. It was empty. Raftdog was alone and it was time to strike and take vengence for all that him and his evil regime had done to cat. Raftdog told cat, ""I know my time has come, but the Whiskerslovakian Empire will rise again!"" With these last words, cat swung a swift stroak with his trusty rusty fishing rod, and ended Raftdog's life, or so it seems.In the Meowice, cat finds Lapurrrrrrrrsha's lost collar, which was the key to her invunerability, and the whole reason why Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha thought she could take the mission in the first place, unfortunately, the empire had found a way to bypass this invunerability, and captured Lapurrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrsha. When cat returned, he was celebrated by all, and bestowed the highest honor by Mr. Meowgi.In conclusion, I greatly enjoyed this anime, and can't wait for the second season to come out. This anime alone helped me achieve my doctoral degree, and was the topic of my thesis paper. I rate this anime 9.5/10 and hope that all of you reading this can experiene the greatness as I have.			"

The only downside of the game is that it doesn't have a main menu and after you choose between the modes causual and realistic, you can't swich to the other mode. It's that or I just don't know how. Anyways, this game is great and I definitely recomend it to others, whether they like fishing games or not.			"

I don't have too many hours yet but I know this is my new way of getting my meals. My entire life I have been a bad cat. I have been stealing from people's houses, stealing their tuna among other fooding items. The gift of this game from my rainbow coated friend truly changed my life, it has shown me the true ways of fishing. I now have fresh fish every day for my breakfast, lunch and dinner. It has given my life new meaning and truly reformed me as a cat. Therefore I have decided to give this a good review.Very good buy for any cats who steal to get their food and want to make a clean break.			"

The different hats you can use to make the gameplay suit you even more. I've had a hell of a lot more fun with this game than I expected to. I'd recommend this game to all my friends & anyone who is considering getting this game, do yourself a favour and pick it up now.( Just caught the Maw & very happy with myself :D )			"

												I was looking for something cute and relaxing to play and, while the asthetic is quite good, I found the gameplay to be quite frustrating and grind heavy. Catching fish does start out as being quite fun, but as you move up you realise that there are many worhtless fish between you and your current money making goal. You can fortunately try clear the way with bombs to scare them off but often I would run into respawns that I was unaware of, making the whole cast a waste of effort. Factor in that some bait requires catching three fish and you can soon see how furstrating losing a single bait to fish fodder can be.All of this soon becomes tiresome and it feels like they do not give you the tools you need to alleviate these issues unless you are willing to grind yout way up high in game money walls. I soon lost interest in my dreams of fishing as a cat but I'm sure one day they will be realised.			"

""Should I buy a boat? Or should I buy a radar?"" These are very important questions for the cat.  Cat Goes Fishing is a cute, slow pace game that requires just enough brain power to keep one occupied and unwind. Just like other players have mentioned, the game is not without its mini challenges such as .. catching the right fish.Goes well with Stravinsky... or other music: Create your own PlaylistIt's not exactly part of the game, but it can certainly be so! I'm sure quite a few players would find the repeating background tunes a bit tiresome.  As a result, I matched one of my fishing activities to, of all things, Igor Stravinsky's ""Petrushka"" . The whole experience got 3x more exciting and whimsical.  Of course some mellower tunes like John Coltrane would yield a more chill game.Some of my overall positve experienceVery easy to learn and navigateFish CATalog:  Or is it a Fish-a-log?  Keeps track of names & characteristics of your catch, convenient for questsThe satisfaction of catching fish that are over 3x the cat's size on a tiny boat.How well it functions on the ""I'm going to get you, stupid fish!!!!"" psychologyCute & Colourful Designs:  The colour coordination and fishy distribution relate to each other really well!!  SoundFx: The different sounds beween the depths of water... also the Cat's grumpy meow is pretty awesome.Conclusion:Take our monies.			"

 Cat Goes Fishing Man,this game is so simple but very zen and relaxant,you certainly will be addicted easily to it because is small,cheap and fun. Key given by the developer,but doesn't affect in any way this review  Gameplay Gameplay of this game is really really simple,you start with a basic rod and catching small fishes.after you get some money selling the fishes you going to get new and better rods.after this you can catch big fishes using the small ones as baits.after you level up sometimes you are going to get quests where you need to catch for example: catch 5 cuddlefishes. you will unlock some upgrades,some new things to buy,and better quests and better fishes to catch. Soundtrack Soundtrack of this game is so relaxing,i absolutely loved it. Positive Points + Cheap+ Much Content+ Small Size+ Much Achievements. Negative Points - The game has only one music.(But it's good!) Overall If you are searching for a small fun game to get achievements and play to kill your boredom,this is the game,you will get addicted on it after the first fish catch!Happy fishing for you!Final Note: 8/10			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a great, relaxing game to play when you have some free time, and it makes the transition to PC from mobile pretty well. There are multiple kinds of artistically styled fish, and various strategies to catch them. Various rods and other equipment, as well as boats, to make catching those deep sea fish easier. If you'd like to see some gameplay, I was gifted a review copy for a Youtube LP here:

												Cat Goes Fishing is basically a lesser version of Ridiculous Fishing(mobile game). You earn money with catching fish. And with that money you can upgrade your gear so that you can catch bigger fish. The difference with Ridiculous Fishing is that you throw your line away and only can catch one fish at a time. The annoying part is that you have less control and some other mechanics will make it harder to catch the fish you want. The progress is also not balanced. And you will have to grind a lot. I wouldn't recommend buying it full price, but it's ok in a bundle or if you can get it really really cheap.			"

												I swear I played it years ago as a flash game on kong or the like, where the endgame he's fishing into space or something.  Anyways, the resolution is stuck (at 1024x768 possible), and in window mode.  There's no menu or settings at all to change the res or audio or anything else.  I got it as part of a bundle and played it straight away because it looked cute/fun, and it was for the first half hour then it turned into a huge grindfest.3.5/10 - will still prob fish again, bc i want to catch a shark.

												Very relaxing casual game, I highly recommend it to those that like those types of games otherwise it's a waste of your time. No real instructions (only told how to work the fishing rod, not what each fish likes) however it is very easy to learn. Thoroughly enjoying it!			"

												I think the title adequately explains what the game is about.This is the kind of game you play while you're waiting to do something else. The art is friendly and colorful. There's 1 music track (turn it off by pressing M) that you can hear in the trailer. The actual game is simple and fun. When you cast your line, you control where the bait moves. Then when you hook a fish, you have to reel it back while avoiding the other fish that may want to eat it. You'll have to use a different type of strategy to catch each fish.There's a leveling system where you can buy and upgrade things with the money from the fish you catch. It's a bit clunky and annoying to use, but I didn't feel that it took away from the game at all. You can buy different fishing rods and add some tweaks to augment your playing style. It's mostly to give you some goals and rewards.It's an okay game.  It's missing a few things, but what's there is fun to play with. If you're interested, I don't think you'll regret spending your five dollars.			"

												Holy crap! This game. I tell you. I couldn't believe that I bought it. I bought it for the cat, the adorable animation, and perhaps the song (this is the song that usually played on Sjin's Farm). I have already played over 2 hours of this game (more than I expected to be honest). The amount of money you require for some of the items is pretty large, but with enough mustard fish you can get the big dollar fishies. The only things about this game that could be improved is the music and a menu. After listening to the same song for 2 hours, I would like to be able to mute it or something. That being said, a menu would be lovely.I would recommend this game to anyone that just wants a casual game to play, and doesn't mind the song looping and looping and looping.			"

												How often do you play a game that is truly upfront and direct about what it is? You're a cat. Like all true, honest cats, you desire fish. Unlike other cats, you have mastered the concepts of money, rockets, fishing rods, hats and boats. Using these freak powers evolution or the tampering of man has given you - the game never says, but we can imagine there's some chilling back story - you fish.Also sometimes the cat meows, or you find a hat, which is really cute.

												Mobile game with broken quest generation where developer put a little effort into balance things. After few initial quests, everything gets incredibly difficult and time demanding with no good payoff. Nice for an hour, chore for few more, not worth the money.			"

												I love fishing within video games. I'll spend hours just fishing in MMOs, RPGs... I don't know why, but the tedium appeals to me. I also love cats!So here I thought I had the perfect game. It was pretty fun until I got to one particular quest... I just can't get past it. So I turn to the internet for help... there's no real presense on the web, and the steam discussion has been less than helpful.So I soldiered on, thinking maybe I can figure out what I'm doing wrong since I can't seem to find any advice on technique.  Well, I still haven't finished that quest.The game is alright. Needs a lot of love, I think, or at least a better tutorial or SOMETHING. The aesthetic is cute, reminds me of old flash games. The music is alright... everyone's saying it's relaxing, but to me it's really repetitve. I supposed I was expecting serene, zen-like music. This is pretty standard video game stuff.			"

												Game that is clearly trying to sell itself as a chill timewaster is anything but, as the jerkwad fish waiting directly below your casting point repeatedly bites apart the fish you're trying to reel in, until you catch him and attempt to use him as bait for something larger only to have that $400 bait wasted by some piece of crap little $25 runt, and then before you know it the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ fish waiting to bite all your catches in half has respawned.Cool idea, horrendously frustrating mechanics.

Pretty fun, easy to learn.However today, I got an error code that won't let me open the game. I posted in the forum, and can see two others have posted the same issue since 8/3/16, and there has been no developer response. I can assure you I won't give anymore money to this POS until it's fixed.Thanks for wasting my money.			"

												I loved this game until I just found out that there is no way to maintain a save file.  I still have my old computer, it's hard drive, and the windows installation.  But it is literally impossible to transfer the save file onto my new installation of windows.  No drive loss or corruption, just the game will simply refuse it if you transfer from another copy of windows.  Nevermind cloud saving and having peace of mind where you never lose your game.  This game will guarantee that you lose your game, every time.  You will eventually need to replace some component of your system, or upgrade Windows, or something along those lines.  I am extremely disappointed in how this is set up.  There's no point in me playing and catching a whole bunch of fish if I know that I am going to upgrade my hard drive eventually.  There is no fix or solution for this.			"

												I'm on the fence about it...like a Maine Coon tabby singing it's heart soaked song to a distant memory seen only in the reflection of the orange moon. As a boot soars through the air, probably to silence the screeching cat; the tabby imagines one last pure of heart wish, to fish and catch the biggest fish out there and sell those fish for tons of money and upgrade fishing polls.This game is that tabby's dream played out.

												The kind of tedium you'd expect from a grindy free web game, combined with levels of annoyance and frustration unparalleled in the history of gaming.

												Cat Goes Fishing, (CGF), is a casual, inide, fishing, singleplayer simulation and, I dont really like it. In my opion, this game is like Curse of Mermos: a game to play when you are bored with nothing else to do. The only reason I'd play this game is for the achivements and the badge it has to offerIn CGF, you are a cat, who fishs. You can sell said fish for money to upgrade your hook and line, or use said fish as bigger bait to TRY and catch bigger fish. That is all the game has to offer, and really, i dont find it that fun. As I said earlier, the game is only good for getting the achivements and the badge it has, to get your Steam level higher. Now, I haven't really gotten into the game, (That is a little bit of a lie). As you progress and complete missions, you will get to go to different areas, such as the ocean, to catch bigger fish, for more money. There.Overall, I don't hate this game. I just don't find it fun. I get if some find it fun, and I don't judge. I personally wouldn't recommend it, but if you want it, you can use that $7 to buy this, but I would save that $7 for other games.			"

												It's a very average game that is reminiscent of those crappy Flash games where you just keep buying upgrades to get further in. At first it's kind of zen - you just hook fish from the water - for like the first half hour. Then it starts getting more complicated - you catch a small fish which you use as bait for bigger ones which can be used to catch the biggest ones. The problem is that the water is filled pretty densely with fish and fish you don't care about will constantly take the bait instead. Fifty times I made a large bait and then threw it in only to immediately be taken by a tiny fish near the surface. Additionally bigger fish can bite at smaller fish on your line and if they do, the fish you caught won't count for any quests you have. You can buy upgrades to counter some of these issues but after the first few they are extremely expensive.  "

												As you might have guessed, this game is about fishing !You are a cat, and your goal is to catch as many fish as possible. This is how you do : firstly, catch a small fish, then use it as a bait to catch a medium one, and finally use the new bait to catch a large fish. The challenge is there : getting the big fish (shark, maw, ...) is not a piece of cake ! You will be rewarded with money by selling fish and completing quests. With money, you can buy new rods (+ upgrades, 8 different kinds, choose wisely), some useful devices/items (rockets, bombs, ...) and boats that allow you to catch more kind of fish by navigating on the sea.You will also find hats while fishing : you can only wear one, so choose wisely in order to get the bonus you want ! You cannot stock them, you can only keep the one that you are wearing. Tip : I think the best one to wear is the baseball cap, because being able to have two quests at the same time is great, especially if you are stuck with one, since you cannot drop it.In the end, this game is simple but pretty fun, even though it is a little bit grindy if you want to unlock everything and get all of the achievements.

												There is very little to distinguish this title from free fishing games.  It may be cute, but the grind gets old fast.For example, let's take the bait mechanics.  Catching a small fish is easy enough, but if you want to catch medium fish, you must first catch a small fish and recast it.  To catch a large fish, you must catch a small fish, recast it as bait, catch a medium fish with that, and recast that one too.  If the wrong size of fish bites down, it can send you backward and make you repeat some or all of these steps.  Why can't we just buy or save medium and large bait?  True, there are hats and upgrades that can help with this eventually, but they don't eliminate what feels like unnecessary tedium.Overall, I gave this game a chance, but left feeling more frustrated than I did relaxed.  For that reason, I would not recommend it.			"

												While people want to say this is a ""relaxing game"" it's not really. I've had less frustration playing Dark Souls. This game is basically a grind fest. You buy a new rod you have to buy the upgrades again too, some of them costing more than the rod itself.When fishing your bait is constantly stolen by smaller fish, and larger fish will steal the initial bait causing the messages ""You need bigger bait!"" to appear over and over, especially if you have grumpers around.Fail to catch that quest fish and the game will taunt you with hints, even though you've already caught the fish before.Honestly this isn't a good casual fishing game that one can open and enjoy. Too much grinding and frustration.I came back to see if there were any new improvements to the game, only to find once again that the cost of the rods HAD GONE UP AGAIN. Lest to say this game is in the ""Will never play again bin"" It was cute, but it's broken.			"

												I realized almost instantly this is a casual game ported to PC. It isn't for me. It took about 30 seconds to get bored. If you want depth and a challenge, this won't be for you either. I know, so ,any positives, but then again, some people are easily amused. Spend $7 on something more tangable.			"

												Fun for a little while, it quickly turns into a grind...much like regular fishing.  You'll spend a lot of time trying to wriggle and dodge your way around fish you don't want, to get one that's worth your time...much like real fishing.  You'll sit on the dock or in a boat, watching the world pass you by as magical hats make firecrackers cheaper...not like real fishing.  Then you say forget it and buy a bomb to get through the fish you don't want...kinda like real fishing.  Then you spend more time waiting and grinding out money to upgrade equipment to catch the best fish....much like real fishing.Its fun in little doses, but lacks progression.....like real fishing.So, I stopped playing and went fishing...and had fish fillet for dinner.  Yummy!(The cat didn't get to eat any.)			"

												Great concept, relaxing, cute, made me want to buy and play.Game is 2002 Flash-level minigame, not worth 8$ on Steam, come on guys.The fishing controls are very awkward and frustrating to use. The fact that tiny fish can eat your large fish that is used as bait is really the biggest design dealbreaker for me here. It turns what could be an enjoyable and relaxing discovery of the ocean into a frustrating grindathon. It does not feel like skill is involved at that point as tiny / midsize aggressive fish carpet the ocean and will just block you all day long and respawn endlessly with you having to waste multiple bombs to clear them in a repetitive tedious fashion.Kind of makes me sad because the concept is great and I love this kind of game. Oh well. "

												It's a lovely game. If it doesn't fit on your screen, ALT+Enter makes it fit. The game has a fairly simple system when it comes to catching fish. Left click the mouse button and then let go at the desired height. You can upgrade your fishing rod itself, aswell as modify it so that it attracts/repels certain fish, casts faster, sinks deeper or slower aswell as many more things. You can also add attachments to the rod such as fireworks so that it can be cast farther or bombs to clear away large shoals of smaller fish. There is also direct rod upgrades which are graphically pleasing and overall, better rods.You can either sell the fish you catch, or recast with them in order to use them as bait to catch the bigger, more expensive fishes and there's a plethora (25 ish at the moment) of different fishes to catch which all require different tactics. The money you gain you can use to purchase upgrades aswell as hats and boats for you to be able to fish better, deeper and further out. The quest and system rewards you with xp and money for catching x number of x fish. The games music is rather pleasing, although tiresome after long sessions. Would strongly reccommend. At the current price £3.74 it is a steal.			"

												4.5/10 Simple game, enjoyable, the mechanics are straightforward. Music is soothing but gets boring after a while; grahpics are simple but it could do better with the edges. As a coder and designer, I hate seeing jagged edges around whatever image they are using. It's just a matter of attitude. If you plan on selling this for money, do it with all your heart.Some bugs that need to be fixed; just like mostly every game.The 7 buck tag is too much for this game. I would recommond you give it a try if it's around 2.5~3 bucks. You can NOT change the settings such as music on/off, screen resolution and all that stuff. Actually there's not even a menu for that.I should give some credits to the person made the top right corner flyer pic. However keep in mind that it has nothing to do with the graphics of the game.**edit 12:08pm 1/20/2015: fixed typo.**			"

												A simple, but entertaining time killer. Cat Goes Fishing is a fishing simulator from Cat5Games. Let’s get rocking.The GoodCat Goes Fishing gets everything just about perfect. The controls are as simple as they come and you won’t even need a tutorial to figure them out. If you did, you’d probably be some sort of mollusk…and not one of the smart ones.There is a delightful plethora of fish for you to catch. The small fries can be caught without any special baiting, but, the further up the scale you move, the bigger the bait you’re going to need to attract your Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s interest.There are several items for you to purchase that will aid you in your fishing endeavors. You can get new rods (and upgrades for each of them), you can buy boats to take you out further onto the lake, you can get a sonar to show you where fish are in the lake, and much more.The boats were especially useful. Some fish only appear further out in the lake and, so, would be unreachable without a boat of some kind. The boat also lets you store a finite amount of fish so that you can sell them when you get back to shore.CGF offers the player “quests” to complete. This results in the player gaining experience and working towards a level up to unlock more gear, but it also fights back at the repetitiveness of the game itself. When you’re given a goal to work towards, you don’t get bored quite as much.The BadInevitably, CGF does become repetitive. There’s only so much digital fishing one can do before they get tired of it.The MehCGF also has hats for you to find in the depths and equip your character with. The hats are absurdly hard to find and you rarely come across one at a moment when you could actually try and snag it with your hook.Verdict: YeaCat Goes Fishing is fun, but it’s more of a novelty game for killing time. If you see it go on sale, by all means, buy it. It’s worth of few bucks. You can find it in the Steam Store. As always, thanks for reading.			"

Shoulder gets sore maybe contoler support would be better. But there is not a lot of button mashing. When you first start off if you take short breaks the fishing seems to get better. But when you get a boat it really picks up. You can even 'troll' by moving the boat while the line is out. Get it on sale.			"

 Very Casual and oddly addicting!	It's an easy game to pick up and play and quickly lose a few hours to. Something about it made me almost certain about how much fun it would be before I bought it and I'm glad that intuition was right! (It's often not) And in terms of casual it's the most casual game I've ever played. I'll sometimes load it up just to play for a few minutes while inbetween doing things. Highly recommended. And sorry I'm not so great at reviews. Oh, I will say one thing. I'm getting old and been dealing with a bout of depression lately, making it hard to enjoy almost anything I would normally enjoy. This game is an easy distraction I can seem to enjoy regardless of my mood. So, if you're feeling the same than this is a good recommendation. :D			"

												I cannot recommend this game enough. As an avid fisherman and cat lover, I wholeheartedly approve of everything this game stands for. Note that I am talking about Realism mode, not classic. The cat is cute.The music is relaxing.The game offers a surprising amount of progression, satisfaction, and depth of gameplay. Each fish fights completely differently from any of the others (something which I as a fisherman appreciate- I probably wouldn't have continued to play if it was simply ""reel in the fish""), and each fish has its own characteristic behavior. I haven't beaten it yet, but I'm getting there, and when I do, I don't think I'll stop playing.tl;dr: Cute cat, enjoyable fishing mechanics, relaxing music, chill. 10/10.			"

												This game is very fun and very addictive. I got to max level at about 9-10 hours. At hour 11 I found a ""legendary"" hat that lets you see the lunge ranges of all fish. However, as soon as i put the bait in the water, the game lagged terribly until I was able to get it out. Now every time I cast, I get a ""fatal error"" and the game crashes. Not cool. Besides that, it's an awesome time waster.			"

												I was not expecting to enjoy this game as much as I have been. It's a very nice simple little game to play when you have some down time and don't know what else you want to do. It's absolutely adoreable and has hours of enjoyment if you like casual little games like this.			"

												This game is so simple, but it's REALLY fun. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it and it's actually become one of my favourite little games. You can jump in and play 5 or 10 minutes if you want to and then pick it up days later without missing a beat. It's super fun, quite challenging and adorable. Who doesn't want to be a cat that goes fishing I ask you?? ^_^			"

												On top of being a fun and well designed game, the team behind Cat Goes Fishing has been fantastic.  A noteworthy amount of additional content has been added since the game's release, including new fish to catch as well as new achievements.  All of this has been free of charge.   Props to Cat5Games for expanding upon their game, without it being at the expense of the consumer.			"

												Pretty simple, casual 2D fishing simulator. Visuals are nice, animations are fine, and music is okay to listen to for a while (then press M to turn it off). Upgrades come in pretty quickly at first, then mid-game there is a lot of unrewarded gold grind while you save for better rods + upgrades, boats, and other upgrades. Quests are decent gold but you can easily get stuck on a quest if you haven't gotten the proper rod/upgrades yet. Also, fish take time to respawn so you may have to wait for the fish you want (or get a boat to increase your fishing range). At end-game once you can grind the shark/maw/anglerfish, gold comes in quickly enough to upgrade everything you want and more.Fishing is pretty straightforward: catch a small fish to catch a medium fish to catch a large/huge fish while avoiding fish you don't want to catch. I upgraded reel speed and lure sink speed to better avoid fish I didn't want to take. The Bait Guard and Crankbait upgrades are really useful, but are also very expensive to grind. Minimap and radar upgrades are nice for avoiding unwanted fish, though you can throw your line beyond the radar (which might be fixed in the beta). Radar is also useful for finding where the Maw/Anglerfish spawn and where you can cast to avoid the most fish on the way down.Pretty fun for a 2D fishing simulator, though I would've liked more special fish like the shark. The shark takes your live fish and drags your line further away, effectively extending your rod's reach further than you normally could go. It's pretty fun to use when you're starting out with mediocre rods and no boat, but I don't think there's any more sharks further out so everything beyond the initial screen is just simple fishing.

												Cat Goes Fishing is a nice balance between cute, entertaining, and challenging. It's an ideal game if you just want to kick back in your pajamas and do some fishing. There's a certain satisfaction to be had when you catch your first hat or snag a particularly elusive fish.There's a small amount of strategy involved as you upgrade/equip gear in order to go after whatever you're actively trying to catch. You also end up using some creative reeling in order to avoid undesirable fish.Important tip! Press ""M"" to mute the music once you grow tired of it and would rather listen to Pink Floyd while you troll the deeps for those profitable fishies. Also, there is no ""exit"" option. It's a mobile port, so just hit the X because it saves on the fly.Relax, get a drink, and catch some dang fish :)			"

												THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC WORTH EVERY CENT!At first I thought this would be a simple and easy game, and oh boy I was wrong.When you get the hang of it, you'll notice a pattern to the game. You'll start  to memorize where a certain type of fish will spawn, you'll start to incorporate bombs and rockets just to catch a certain type of fish and you will find your own preference of rod modification to suit your own fishing method.This game turns out to be very addictive and surprisingly very challenging (it took me 2 hours just to catch my first Mew shark). But once you get all the steam achievements and amass tonnes of wealth I found out that the replayability of the game is awful, its just another cycle of catching a fish, reel it in and repeat. There should be an option where 1) The cat can purchase a plane and hop off onto another island (that has rare and exotic fish perhaps?) 2) Buy a house and decorate it with cupboards and store all different kinds of hats (I hate selling Legendary Hats!)3) The cat would get hungry and would like to eat a certain type of fish9.5/10			"

												It's said never to judge a book by its cover.  Fortunately this is a game, by loosest of all defintions, and not a book.  Judge it by its cover as much as you want to, you really get everything you'd expect by reading the title:  you are a cat, you go fishing, does really anything else need to be said?This game combines all of the best parts of LolCats and fishing with out needing to get up super early in the morning, get cold (unless if you really want to), and wait around for hours for a fish to bite.  Fishing has become streamlined, there are upgrades, you catch fish.  If that doesn't sound appealing, I don't honestly know what does.  If you are going to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale.  Seriously do not buy it for $7.  You can buy an entire meal at McDonald's and enjoy the inevitable stomacach for the exact same amount of time as this game has to offer.			"

												It’s reel good. The menu has a paws function. You have to sea it. I had a whale of a time. I'm hooked. I'm sorry.Let’s give an actual review:Cat Goes Fishing is literally a game where you are a cat and you cast your line into the water and grab a fish. The water is full of types of fish, all with different attributes. Generally, you start by getting a small fish, then you use that as bait to get a bigger fish and so on. Then you sell the fish and buy upgrades, like a big rod and a boat. To increase variety and give goals, the game has an optional quest system that ranges from easy to difficult. It’s addictive and simple, but has everything you would want for this type of thing. The constant upgrades and range of fish types give the game more variety.I suppose my only criticism is that being a cat has almost zero effect on the game. The protagonist could have been a person and that wouldn't have changed anything.			"

												WTF? I spent over 8 hours fishing as a cat already? What's wrong with me? Deceptively addictive and well made casual game, with rather bizarrely some significant tactical elements. Good for when you can't be arsed to play a proper game.			"

												To paraphrase the old Ronseal adverts from the UK, this game does exactly what it says on the tin. You're a cat. You go fishing. It is quite simply the most calming, most stressful, most addictive fishing game I've played since Sega Marine Fishing. It mixes in a quest system, upgrades, a hierarchy of fishes & lures a la Feeding Frenzy, and that good old fashioned ""one more go"" game feeling. And hats.Simple one button control for casting & reeling, straightforward presentation & charming art. What more do you want? Well worth a grab.			"

												An adorable, simplistic game of fishing.Although it may seem repetitive at first, the more you unlock the more of a challenge it becomes. Smaller fish can be complete butts and steal your larger bait aimed for much bigger fish making you lose money as you attempt to capture that damn shark.Most importantly...YOU PLAY AS A CAT! A cat that fishes! A fishing cat! A cat...fish.The graphics are plain, yet have something charming about them and the music has a sense of calming to it and definitely fits the game well.

												Cat goes fishing is an addicting simplistic 2-D game where you play as, you guessed it! A cat. This cat is no oridary cat this cat has a special talent that only is mastered by those given the name of fisherman. In this game you upgrade rods, boats, hats, and add things to your rod that affect the way it behaves. This is a great game I would reccomend this to anyone, it is a great time passer. I rate 9/10 because the fish could maybe be a bit better at the moment everything is like paper, and some animation would be nice.			"

												This is a very enjoyable game.  Played with my little one and he just roared his head off.The achievements are really easy (I just can't seem to get a legendary hat, RNGsus hates me I guess).  The controls are super easy (forward and backward to move the boat, mouse click to cast).  Rewards come quickly, which makes it great for young players.  And the graphics are really cute.It is just what you would expect to get when buying.  Very pleased, worth the price.  =^-^=			"

												It's said never to judge a book by its cover.  Fortunately this is a game, by loosest of all defintions, and not a book.  Judge it by its cover as much as you want to, you really get everything you'd expect by reading the title:  you are a cat, you go fishing, does really anything else need to be said?This game combines all of the best parts of LolCats and fishing with out needing to get up super early in the morning, get cold (unless if you really want to), and wait around for hours for a fish to bite.  Fishing has become streamlined, there are upgrades, you catch fish.  If that doesn't sound appealing, I don't honestly know what does.  If you are going to buy this game, wait for it to go on sale.  Seriously do not buy it for $7.  You can buy an entire meal at McDonald's and enjoy the inevitable stomacach for the exact same amount of time as this game has to offer.			"

												Cat Goes Fishing is a simple and casual fishing game.Throw a fishhook, Wait for sinking a bait and Pull a reel.It is the unique point that caught small fishes are used as a bait to catch bigger fishes.Any fishes have value rather than money.Pros:- Simple and casual- Cute fishes of variety- CheapCons:- Fishes may wish to be eaten by other fishes rather than that they will be caught by me.(Caught fishes fighted to escape, then they were eaten by other fishes)- Could not change a quest (Some quest are very hard for a beginner)			"

However, as soon as i put the bait in the water, the game lagged terribly until I was able to get it out. Now every time I cast, I get a ""fatal error"" and the game crashes. Not cool.

												It looks silly, simple and basic.But you know what? It's a lot of fun, and honeslty can be very challenging to hook that prized fish you really want or need to complete that quest!At the same time, it can be a total zen-out game to enjoy at anytime.Totally worth it!			"

												probably one of the most fun games on the market, and for a  great price of $7.79, this game is a snag of a deal, i recommend that you invest all of your free time in this game to play because it takes a lot of time out there fishin, so get out there and give it your all! boy!			"

												This is a story of the adventure of a cat and his trusty fishing rod. Collect hats which improve your fishing prowess.Upgrade your rod using thousands of dollars you got from selling fish. (The cat economy is weird)Catch 100 grumpers because they won't let your bait past.Play at night and have a shark eat all of your bait.10/10Best fishing game of all time.			"

												A nice and relaxing game, perfect for playing in small bursts. The controls are simple and the progression quite straightforward, but it also offers some challenge if you are aiming to catch the biggest and baddest fishes in realism mode, or clear all the achievements.The main grip I could see with this game is that the graphics are simple and a bit repetitive, and the music consist only of one track, but both those things, being at the same time quite nice, kind of encapsulated me in a pleasant little experience. Perfect for a casual fishing game.			"

												This game is very sweet and relaxing. You play as a cat, fishing for well... fish. You slowly upgrade your rods and get boats, and you get quests to completed (which some are actually a bit of a challenge!). You can catch cute hats, upgrade your rods, and more, and the asking price is more than reasonable for the amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of this game so far. It's a good one to play when you need to relax. 10/10 would be a bonnet-wearing fishing cat again.			"
