												first off, if you were one of the reviewers who said this game is P2W, may i ask you who exactly are you trying to ""win"" in a city builder with no pvp? what ever crack you were smoking, please stop before you wreck yourself.i have played this game for about 2 weeks so far and haven't spent a dime (nor will i ever need to) and have gotten to 2,000 Merchants in progression. yes it isn't very ""fast"" but this game was never meant to be some cookie cutter insta-win game. all those so-called ""microtransactions"" that the ADHD kids were complaining about? they were ALL either cosmetic or convenience speed-ups. none were necessary AT ALL.i fully intend to reach the end-game (4,000 Imperials) without spending anything, just to prove this point. may take a month or two, but that's okay for me. will update this review with how long it took me to hit end-game with $0. Pros (+)+truly F2P (you can access 100% progression w/ zero spending)+charming hand-drawn graphics (complements medieval setting)+great gameplay focused on resource management+awesome helpful community, quirky mature players (UK server)+friends can help with boosts, trades, constructors+decent music -- yes, there are volume controls►idiots who can't find it... shouldn't be allowed to post reviews+small filesize+low cpu/gpu demands (leave it running in bg if u like) Cons (-)-some in-game functions are hard to understand (ask in chat)-a bit glitchy sometimes (nothing game-breaking though)-guild functions are still minimal at the point of writing Misconceptions= don't need to pay to speed-up; game is about time mgt= this isn't a AAA full-featured Anno game... re: price tag $0= Anno fans can still enjoy this game tremendously= is a browser/mobile port; but more playable than most other f2p ports= game had loading problems in 1st few days, mostly resolved now= reviews with <1 hour gameplay should NOT get 600+ upvotes SRSLY			"

												German Review down below / Deutsches Review weiter untenFirst as i saw this game in the shop i thought that i already played that game so i googled it and yes its just a browser game from ubisoft which i already played 2 year ago i think.So this ""game"" is just a port for the browser game which let it play you in steam instead in a browser wowNow you think that there is something that must make it better then the browser game yes there is one thing but mostly a port to make money from a old game.Cons:-Just a port for a browser games-No better graphics or sound (at least it looked like that)-Ingame nano transaction like the browser game but wait it comes even better now you can use you steam wallet to buy rubins gems or however you want to call them Pros:-You dont need a Uplay account to play-You can do everything (expect some building with higher production/decoration) but it will take a lot of time if you dont use moneyYes i know you can get rubins by completing quest or events but it arent very muchGerman Review:Als ich das Spiel zum ersten mal im Shop geshen habe glaubte ich das ich es schon mal gesehen habe also habe ich danach gegoogelt um festzustellen das es das gleiche alte Browser Spiel von Ubisoft ist das ich berteits vor 2 Jahren gespielt habe.Dieses ""Spiel"" ist also nur ein Port von einem Browser Spiel welcher es ermöglich in Steam anstatt im Broser zu SpielenNun glaubt man vielleicht das dieser Version wenigsten ein paar Vorteile haben muss aber nein es ist dieselbe alte Grafik und Sound es gibt einen Vorteil aber eigentlich ist es nur ein Port um noch Geld mit einem alten Browser Spiel zu machenCons:- Nur ein Port für ein altes Browser Spiel-Keine bessern Grafiken oder Sounds als im Originalspiel-Ingame mini Transkationen wie im Browser Spiel aber wartet es kommt noch besser nun könnt ihr euch endlich Rubine oder Diamtent wie ihr sie auch nennen wollt mit eurem Steam Geld kaufen yayPros:-Man braucht keinen Uplay Account-Man kann alles machen oder erreichen (außer ein paar Bonus Gebäude höhere Produktion/Aussehen) aber es dauert sehr lange ohne das man Geld ausgeben tutja ich weis man kann Rubine durch das machen von Quest bekommen oder durch Events aber es sind nicht sehr viele.If you find anything in my review that isnt correct or something that i missed feel free to comment it.Wenn ich irgendetwas falches behauptet habe oder wenn ich etwas vergessen aber fühlt auch frei es zu kommentieren.

Posted: October 23, 2015
												I first played this game over 2 years ago when it was offered through EA games website.  Until they shut it down because no one was playing it anymore.  I noticed it was offered through steam and I wanted to come back for 2 main reasons.First, to see if anything had been changed, improved in all that time and the most important one was so when I wrote this review it would be as accurate as possible.  Yes, I did forget about this game and most of the content in 2 years so I wanted to be accurate.First of all let me give you my recommendation, NO, please do not download or play this game.For those of you with no patience it is sid meyers sim city meets micro transactions.The game is a browser game port that requires flash to play.  It is hardwired so that it prefers google chrome flash over adobe flash.  Up to a few days ago if you had a semi modern pc or laptop you could not even get into the game because it did not recognisze a 64 bit flash version as a valid one.  Yes, it was a straight port over from browser to steam.Okay I will step up on my soap box, I personally do not think browser games or phone games belong on steam period.Now I will step off of my soap box and tell you why this game, this Anno Online is bad.Before I do that I want to give 2 points away to those few people who give this a positive review.  It is not pay to win, there  is no PVP at all, barely any combat I will go into that in detail in a bit.  Let us call it what it is, pay to play.  There is someone in the forum who claimed to be able to unlock everything for free but he did spend over 400 days doing it.  I can not confirm or deny it but it does sound about right.  Let me give you a warning here.  If you ever miss one day logging in your loyalty program will drop back to day 1, even if you did spend 2 years playing it.  My second point I will give those few people with a positive review is if you are going to write a review, good or bad please use more then 1 word so it is helpful.  Okay got those out of the way.The game is pretty staright forward.Your little ship shows up on a new island, you build your first house and your first woodcutter.  Total population 1, yeah.Then you will spend the next 8 to 10 hours depending on how familiar you are with sid meyers sim city games to grow your population from 1 pioneer to 1500 vassals. You will make houses, farms, markets and wells, maybe a church here or there.  Then you scratch your head and go, hmmm, now what.  Now you hit the first pay wall.  Your little settlers are asking you to give them linen shirts which takes hemp which your main island does not have.  So now you have 2 choices.  One you can go to the market place and buy a little island with hemp or build an explorer ship and hope to find one.  This process can take anywhere from 1 day if you are really really really lucky to a week to a month depending on what you find.  This is assuming you managed to avoid all those pop ups for micro transactions getting here.  So for arguments sake, you really ""don't"" have to buy your first island it just helps.Then you have your little island.  You think, lets rename it hemp island or something.  Nope, you can not rename any of your islands or ships.  You repeat the sid meyer city building, a few houses, a few woodcutters and some hemp farms.  Now you make your settlers on your main island happy right??  Ah, not really.  What you find is that the little trade ship you can build, or buy can haul back about 5 shirts.  It will take you at least another little hemp island and another trade ship to make any kind of progession in game at all.Okay so you are still playing, you have your little hemp island and your main island with its 1500 vassals.  By now your pop up help menu has annyoed enough to no end that you will start trying combat.  Combat involves 3 ship types, the brig, the caravel and the galley.  Each one is good against one type, poor against one type and even against ships of the same hull.  You will line up your little ships, hit attack and they move forward like in a chess match and shoot cannons. Period, plain and simple.  Of course you have gem items like chain shot or smoke screens or repair kits to make it a bit more interesting.  For arguments sake, yes you can make these if you get cannon balls as a reward but you will use up way more then you ever get.Still playing, wow, if you managed to finally unlock the next section you will see that your little settlers now are asking for more goods that you can not make on your home island or your little tiny hemp island.  So now you hit your second paywall.  Do you buy a medium sized island, or a large island or a huge island.  Keep in mind they cost up to 19,000 rubies or $60 each and you can own 12 islands currently.In my opinion you can buy the stand alone pc copy Anno 1404 and play it for about $10 and have a better, more complete and fun experience.For a better all round experience I would recommend you pick up any of the Patrician series games, where you can actually move your ships in combat, fire the cannons etc.			"

												This pay to win game has the same problems as any other pay to win game:-too many pop-ups-horrible pacing-artificial focus on one primary resource that is always needed-you constantly need to spend money, to circumvent artificial problemsBesides, this game doesn't feel at all like any other Anno. It's not even close to any other reasonable building game, economy game, or however you want to call the genre Anno belongs to.			"

Posted: July 28, 2015
												I have been a player of this game since Aug of 2013, when the game was only browser based and in beta. when I first started playing there were several bugs, but in the past year (2014) most of the bugs have been cleared, and a lot of new content and changes have happened.  This game is constantly changing and always for the better.Unlike most Free to play games, Anno Online has NO PVP, which makes for a different environment.  My fellow players and myself have a very helpful community VS one out to kill each other.  Another thing that sets Anno Online apart from the others is that you don't need to buy the ingame currency to get anywhere, all you need is a little amount of time... I didn't hit the top population on the starting island till a year after I started playing, but no other player insulted me, or kicked me out of their guild because i hadn't hit the ""End Game"".  Game play of Anno Online is very much like Anno 1404 AKA Dawn of Discovery (in North America), Except for a few major changes;1) There is no Spice/indigo/silk Islands - all the oriental goods that you made in 1404 are instead Sold by a NPC vendor2) Monuments -  In Anno Online Monuments are 100% different and there are more monuments than in any other Anno game.3) Island colonization - there is no NPC stealing the island you wanted in Anno online, you find islands for yourself and only yourself, they are 100% random and very different... but i will admit it's hard to find just the ""right"" island4) Interactions with other players - you help your neighbors in Anno online by sending buffs or your constructor over to their islands, and in turn you get rewarded for some of it... there is no hostile interactions between players.5) Construction - in Anno online, you can move buildings with no resource penalty but deleting you only get back 1/4th of what you put in. VS other Anno games where if you put a building down you have to delete to put it somewhere else, which in most missions you lose 1/2 resources.6)Combat-  In anno games you control the ships and they fight the other ships in real time with little to no rewards... in Anno Online, Possibly cause it's too much strain on the servers the combat is Turn Based, but every combat you enter gives you rewards, these rewards can be spent on fun things to boost your economy with one issue, it's a strain on your economy early on to be building up and doing PVE, and many veteran players suggest doing the PVE to mid/late stages of the game.Now it isn't a proper review without posting a few negative points;1) Zone locks- these freaks of nature can hurt, and sadly seem more frequent now with more players coming in from the steam community, but there is 2 ways that I know BB handles these... first is the auto script, it runs every day at midnight server time (8pm eastern time)- 90% of zone locks are fixed this way... I have had a zone lock and the auto script handled it.   The other way is BB has to go in and find the error, sadly this takes time and can take from days to weeks to even a month in some cases. however sad you do get reimbursed for time lost.2) Minor combat bugs - since this latest patch these might not show up... but on some maps after attacking and winning a boat may get 'stuck' and becomes unusable... i haven't seen if the map is still in the game after this last patch but they can happen if near an island for combat.3) Construction- losing 3/4 of resources spent is a major blow if you built the wrong building.4) early game - it's slow... very slow but that's why we have our friendly chat system to make you forget how long something takes.5) As with all multiplayer games, Trolls  just can't avoid them on the internet.6) This one is more personal- can't use steam client with the web started accounts.  This is something I would love to be added in the future.7) lack of a 2nd ruby cutter... would be nice to cut rubies faster... but it's again a personal complaint.All in all I like the game and would recommend it to others!Since writing this post I started working on a US based fan site for Anno Online.If you are looking for more information about the game, head over to AnnoAddiction.com "

Product received for free
												I started this game four days prior to this review.. got my town to a nice size, everyone was happy and I was earning gold like crazy because I was doing well.  Day of this review I try to get back to my town... loading screen took half an hour only for a small window to appear saying ""Your zone was locked"" with the only options being an ok button.  I figured it was a mistake so I reloaded the game four times.. each time the same result.  I checked their forum to see how to fix this and turns out this happens constantly... the game data degrades on you and locks you out and the unlocking period if you send in a ticket takes a long time only for it to happen days later.  I feel cheated in some way... literally wasted my own time I could of spent elsewhere on this game only for it to break on me.  This game may be free but apparently if you don't spend any money on it to buy gems from their in-game store you're dubbed a free player and your tickets are ignored... I didn't buy anything from their store with real money.  My only options are restart from scratch or waste more of my time on a game that stops working on you after a short time period.  This game.... left a very foul taste in my mouth... and made by the same company who I've already gave a bad review for another of their games turned crappy... I should of known this would happen but if I did I'd never of played it to begin with			"

												First, don't believe the garbage you read about this game being pay to win.  How can a game be P2W if there is nothing to win, this is a single player building game not a moba.  All you can pay to do is speed up the game.  No one in their right mind would think being able to pay to skip a level in a single player game would equal P2W.  Besides the gems are entirely unnecessary to enjoy the game and in fact you get the gems for free throughout the game.  Now that I got that out of the way I'm not entirely sold on this game.  At the end of the day it's a resource management game and a very vanilla one at that.  Most people would find this game boring.  You should know going in that this is not a very exciting game and it takes time to get what you want done.  So if you go in expecting a slow methodical building game that you casually play to relax you'll have a good time.  If you want something more fast paced and interactive I suggest you skip this game.			"

												Stay away from this game for the following reasons:1. Support is bad. And I mean seriously bad. The moment you have a serious problem with your account, it takes weeks to fix it and some old time players report of accounts taking months to get fixed.2. The Mod team is biased and holds grudges against anyone that dares to comment on the game or Bluebyte. Talking about support, mods, gamemasters etc. gets you instant banned. They do not allow any negative talk about this crappy game in chat. The moment you get a warning once you get on their bad list and everything you do or say is monitored to the strict letter of their interpretation and mindset. There is no room for free thought or a healthy discussion to try and explain your point of view. It's like the German stuborness we all got to know.3. Warning for new players: About 3 mins into the game you will notice that the only way to play smoothly is by paying for rubies. As a paying customer (so buying rubies) you only get full support. Players not buying rubies get limited to no support.4. In game General Chat is awesome BUT the moment the moderation team speaks the mood drops 100% and everyone is tiptoeing around the moderation team.Stay away from this game. Seriously stay away. I have been playing it for about 3 months now and ever since trouble started at the Bluebyte company the fun has been killed the moderator team a few times. I bought rubies for around € 100,00 and my account has been bugged for 3 days. No responding from support nor CM team. And I am not the only one, look at the forum of the game and see the Zone Lock messages. Btw you are not even allowed to make a comment on other people's zone lock or you will get .... banned :)There are way better free games to spend your time on.. Seriously avoid this game, in stead have fun playing a decent one from a nice company!Well after 4 days, 2 warnings and an actual forum ban I got my account back. I told some other CM in an e-mail that their stupid ""fix"" utility cases the continuous Zone Locks for certain players and that BB should stop running it. And guess what? After that suggestion accounts got working again. Did I ever get a thank you? Nah Aeyline smacked me a forum ban for commenting on the lack of support.... Erm the world upside down :)Update #1: While playing on Friday 26-07 chat all of a sudden disappeared. Chat servers have been unstable, so no surprise there. Usually it gets fixed within an hour or som because 75% of the fun in Anno Online comes from the chat community. BIG MISTAKE! Chat servers were down for over 48 hours and were only restarted on Monday 29-06 ! Thats over 48 hours with totally no ability to chat in game, contacting your friends, guildies etc. to get help playing. Seems BB can't afford to pay weekend staff anymore. Bankrupt anyone?Update #2: Chat servers were restarted on Monday around 13:00 my time (Europe) and we got 200 UNCUT rubies as compensation for the pain. For a new player that amount is halved because their ruby cutter is using 2:1 ratio... So they get a 100 cut rubies (values about 30 dollar cents) What can you buy with that? Erm... nothing... A decent thing to buy with rubies starts from 500 rubies and goes up! Way to go BB, perfect to show the new players you are only greeding for their money, cannot even keep a chat server up and during the entire downtime not write 1 message to inform all players. Guess CM Aeyline was sleeping the entire time!Update #3: Logged in this morning (tuesday 28-06) and tatatadaaaaah! NO CHAT SERVER!Like I recommended.. Stay away from this piece of crap. Only reason I am still playing is because the money I invested in it and my (dwindling amount) of friends in game...			"

												This game could be compared to a mobile city builder game, it is not a game you can play longer than a few minutes to an hour each day, unless you want to spend real money on resources and other stuff to speed things up. You log in, build a little, upgarde some buildings, and once you use up the resources generated over the past 15+ hours you are pretty much done and have to wait a day for your resources and money to replenish to continue.If you don't have a lot of time and just want to build a little each day Anno Online is a good choice; however if you are after a game you can sit and play for hours at a time building up a huge empire without limitations you are better off with a full Anno game be it 1404 similar to Anno Online in style or 2070 with a futuristic setting.In my opinion it's better to spend a bit of money up front and buy Anno 1404. You will get a lot more out of it and you don't have to constantly wait for things to finish.But Anno Online is free, so no reason not to try it especially if you never played any Anno games before and if you'd prefer a lot slower pace with little building each day.

												Anno used to be such a good series. This game is not part of that series. It's a Steam version of a free to play game you'd see on iOS. The original games are about building your own settlement; this is just about clicking ok a few times to make the game play itself. Meh :-(			"

												Some people say this is p2w trash and the moderator team is bad.I dont think so.It a nice game with good graphic and there little animation too.The music nice.The game itself is generous about rubies.You get quite some at the start and then later on either you get rubies from daily log in or some misson later on give a ruby cutter and 1 200 uncut rubies for you to cut.That quite nice.Low on resource?Take a break and it will refill itself.Peoplse say it time consuming but really,every city buildinng game is time consuming.Plus if you get stuck you can ask it in the chat and someone will answer.Overall it good if you want a f2p city building game with helpful community.Thanks for spending time reading this and have a good day.

												I love this game (well, I thought). Typical Anno experience. Graphics are adorable and the gameplay is awesome (if you like the Anno franchise).BUT... it is either too time consuming in a negative way or too expensive. If you don't invest time or money you don't progress a bit in this game. As much as I would like to love it, it is better not played at all!			"

												This game is simliar Anno 1701, but with slightly better graphics, so if you liked that game you might like this. However, this is a Pay-2-Win game since it its free to play. Like all P2W games you don't have to use money to play, but without it your gameplay is considerably slower than those who does.			"

												Firstly, let me get the hours i've played out of the way, i haven't used the Steam version at all, i've been playing the browser version for many months, i'm up to 941 imperials, without spending anything. Although i did buy Anno 1404 just to try it out, I actually prefer this game to Anno 1404.It's the sort of game where you play a little while then come back later. The fact that you can move buildings around to optimize population and farms is one of it's stronger points. There's a scoreboard tab in the quest book which shows population, so you can compete with other players if you want to.Where it really shines is the quests they give you, simple things but it's fun to mess around with ships and population (more population, more gold).i personally ignored the ship battle part of the game, you can do that if you want, although you might be one island short at the end, but it doesn't matter. Yes, there are several islands you will be able to build on, and you can swap between them at any time, another good feature.You can make friends and join guilds, but i never bothered with the guilds. I would have liked to play the Steam version with my old account, but it won't let me.1) A few tips before you start, don't spend your rubies, keep them to upgrade the Ruby Cutter, costs 2,999 rubies. You get rubies every week and when you increase in level.2) You can buy wood with gold from the store but it's limited to a certian amount.3) Do not place the Guildhall down, it is a waste of space, you can't remove it, and you won't need it.I recommend this game especially if you like the old The Settlers games, where it takes time to do stuff, it's made by the same makers.

												This is a game where you pay to speed up building, only to pay to speed up building, only to pay to speed up building, only to pay to speed up building.This is a Facebook game ported to steam. These titles are rubbish and made purely to bilk you. Meaning, made to frustrate you enough to cause you to pay.Do not pay, do not play. These kind of games won't go away if people keep playing them.Why are we calling this a game? And we let this massive corporation get away with calling it ""free to play"".A load of malarkey, a hot, steamy load of malarkey. If you want a game like this, buy the full Anno's or get Banished for like $5 on sale. Seriously, do not give this game your money. Unless you want a hot load of malarkey on your lips and face, by all means...play this game. "

			From the makers of Anno 2070 comes the browser based game Anno Online. This future free to play title is currently in closed beta. It plays very much like Anno 1404.		

Fans of Anno turn back, before it's too late.  The game is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ized version of Anno and for people who have played the game they will find this game is lacking.  For people who haven't played it, they might enjoy it... but probably not.  It comes with all the free to play Farmville mechanics.  Tired of waiting on things, maybe invite your friends, maybe pay some money.Save yourself the trouble and buy Anno 2070.  It will be cheaper in the end and you will enjoy it far more.			"

												Pretty mixed on this.It's a combination of Anno 1404 and a free-to-play city builder. It positions itself fairly close to Anno - it's all about efficient resource chains, and how you position buildings to get the most benefit. It's what I thought I wanted a game like this to be: more about actually playing well than just dumping money into it.However, I can't say I really like it. I've played for about a week, feeling compelled to keep logging in, but not actually enjoying it.So I'd say that if you want a decent city builder you can play for a few minutes a day, it's the best I've seen. But personally, I've had enough of it.			"

												It's very unfair to play a free game for 5 minutes and then bad mouth it just because it's not the same as the paid line of games.I've found the game play enjoyable and up with most of the games that demand management and constant attention. The people online with you are very helpful in the chat, and a Blue Byte member is frequently online too to answer any questions you may have. This is not an action game, not even any PvP, so if that is your scene, then don't bother. If you want a relaxing, fun, and social hour or two every day, then this is thouroughly recommended.And just to repeat, 5 minutes of game time does not a reviewer make. "

												That's right, guys, it's a browser game. On Steam. Honestly, I had a lot of fun with it. There is no need whatsoever for the microtransactions unless you lack patience. I didn't spend a penny on this game and did just fine. Every single thing you can buy with rubies, you can also just wait and have it anyway. There's no need to trash this game specifically because you don't like browser games. I've noticed that every single browser game on Steam has mixed to negative reviews and it's all because people don't like browser games. As far as this sort of game goes, I really enjoyed Anno Online. It has me really wanting to get some of the actual Anno games aside from this.			"

												Meh...This game is meh... But it isn't a bad game. This is good for people who wants to play a city building game but doesn't have too much time to sink into it. Open this up during lunch break to build a few buildings, go back to work. It is good for people with a busy schedule. It takes time to gather resources, trading, and ship related actions, however, unlike mobile city planning games, you don't need to tap on every production building to collect resources. You don't need to bug other people to help with production. You only need to collect production if you order a specific item to be built. There are microtransaction, however, they are for impatiant people. If you're impatiant, in the first place, this game isn't for you, just spend the money you would have used on mircotransaction on an actula city buidling game, like the regular Anno games.			"

The artwork is also really well done and there are plenty of mini quests and variety. HOWEVER, that being said there are glitches such as listed deposits of minerals not actually  being useable and the entire game takes a hiatus about every twenty five hours of game play and will not load for 24 to 72 hours. Highly frustrating. overall my feelings regarding this game would be neutral. What is good is great, but it has issues.			"

												Anno Online is a free to play browser based strategy simulation game that lets you build and manage big Medieval cities.  Sort of like Sim City as a medieval island city game with some naval combat and trading added.  Based off of the Anno game franchise.  It worked, looked ok, has an extensive tutorial.  Looked like you can play some without paying real money.It is free to play, give it a try if you like Sim City type games.for more info:

												TL;DR: If you complain about a free game having premium currency...then nobody in the gaming industry will miss you when you die.Decided to give this game another review, for two reasons...One, its addictive, and I'm playing it so damn much, and two, it's a bit more stable now that I've properly 'told' it to use my graphics card instead of integrated graphics...If you like shoddy pvp tied in with pve games, then this game is NOT for you.If you ♥♥♥♥♥ about premium currency in free to play games, then this game is NOT for you.If you're impatient, or god forbid have ADD, then you must be one of the top 2-3 reviewers of this game, who havn't played it for a single hour even...If you want a civ-builder, somewhat like banished, then here's my perspective of the game (i went in this game instead of actually buying banished, so here you go). It's easy, very laid back and self-managing. The game has a positive, dedicated community (since all the add ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ here on the internet are driven away by their inherient ADD) and, although the first island is the same for everyone, the rest of the islands you begin colinizing (after a few days to a week of playing) are quite randomly generated (not ENTIRELY, yet still enough to feel satisfying, and make you picky enough to constantly look for bigger and better islands). It even has event with unique items apparantly, cant wait to see how this halloween turns out!The only downsides I actually have to this game at all is that it's hard to load at times. If the game hogs on the loading screen after 2-3 minutes, close and reopen it, repeat until it works; this was a huge problem to start, but seems to be more stable after awhile. Besides that, it's a little buggy, and crashes, yet ""nothing game-breaking"". I don't know what else people who are complaining expect from this game....its a builder, you build things, hurr......don't need to pay them money to build, at all. Period.			"

												This is a pretty decent port of a browser-based game of the same name which was released back in 2013. Although 2 years old already it's player base is still lively enough and if chat is working you shouldn't have much of a problem finding someone to help you if you get stuck. Now to the meat and potatoes of the matter. I'm sure a lot of people out there on Steam are tired of seeing mobile/browser games continually released on steam as Freemium titles, and yes, to the more enthusiast segment of gamers this game probably isn't for you. That said, the Steam edition of Anno Online, in my opinion, is better than the browser equivalent for a couple of reasons. Firstly, no more re-downloading the entire game every time you have to clear your browser's cache and secondly, very simple full screen support. Hear all my thoughts on the game in my video overview:

												Good game, F2P port but nice to play and addictive. Sometimes bit hard to understand but good help from user community. Has some issues on some machines saying it needs Chrome or Flash Player installed while they are installed. Havent bothered looking for a solution for this since I have a working machine. Does use Microtransactions, but not needed to enjoy the game. Just need to have patience if you want to keep it free.			"

												I really loved this game. Played it daily up to over 300 daily log ins. But, the customer support is quite frankly non existant. After spending a few hundred dollars on the game over the last two years, I had a problem, so I asked customer support. I got nothing but canned support messages with really no help at all. Love the game, hate the customer support. After over two years of playing this game, time to move on.			"

												Not what alot of people expect, but a fun little thing to try anyway.This game is nothing like the payed anno games, if you come into it with that mindset youre going to be disappointed, this is essentially a mobile city building game (there is a port for mobile, try that on a tablet) but all-in-all, it's nothing special, it never will be anything special, but the community is friendly, willing to help, the art style if appealing, the soundtrack is surprisingly very good for a cheap little forgotten mobile port, and there's a special satisfaction from constructing an aesthetically appealing city that is also functional, the same satisfaction from the same process in cities skylines or simcity, albeit scaled down a lot. Also, this is very much a pick up and put down game, leave it open in the backround, check it every couple hours, open it before you leave for work and make small adjustments, honestly it's my favorite game of that type, but that's what this is. It's not CIV, it's not Anno, the only characteristic they share is the art style, if none of this has turned you off, then you may enjoy the few minutes a day you put into it.All-in-all: Eh, and that's what its meant to be, and thats where its best; Eh			"

												Slow pace game. Not recomended for gamers who like fast progress ( power leveling ), on the other hand you can progress very fast if you are willing to spend a lot $$$$. Community is very calm and helpful if you ask questions about game. Its nice relaxing game if you are looking to kill few minutes or few hours everyday. Why everyday? Well if you dont log in and do few things at least once a day, i recomend at least few times thru the day if possible, your proggress its gonna be slow and you will end up being one of those who leave negative review.

												This game's quite fun for those that appreciate little contact time with the game itself. I like the strategy, time management and planning elements in this game and it makes me appreciate the structure of the real world and the value of trade and community.This game doesn't even require a player to spend rubies, an in-game currency that is brought with ""real-world"" money. With enough patience and planning, one could virtually sustain a storage of rubies without ever buying any via micro-transactions and always be in surplus.			"

You build your city from start, develop its economy, fight against pirates... well, and it's fun, beauty, nice musics, nice animations, and no need to pay for develop the city, juste take a pause and your ressources are refreshed. Unfortunatly, there's no multiplayer fighting, but if you like management and improve your city, like first simcity, you will like this game.			"

												So this is what I am going to tell you. I am playing this game for 1 year and more, but I had a stop of something like 6-8 months. But since I returned I keep playing the game. So the game is typical anno- you construct, collect resrouces, trade with other players and if you want, you can make some naval battles.First things first.You need patience for this game. It is the same typical time strategy. You wait for minutes or hours for something to be completed. Sometimes you will progress very slowly and you will even think that you do not progress at all, but sometimes your progress could be fast as a bullet, shot from AK-47.The economy is typical to the Anno games- for some tools and equipement you will need another one, created from a resource.You discover new islands but you need to unlock the slot first.The premium currency are gems. But because I have a building that actually I can make gems, I feel like I do not need to spend a cent for the game. You have daily log-in reward and every 7th day, you get some raw gems that you can transfer to real gems and use them. After you upgrade your building 240 raw gems = 240 gems, but before that it is 240 raw gems = 120 gems, so you better upgrade that building first.There are people in the chat if you want to chat. The game is not dead at all. There are many people.The graphics are good for the eye and you will enjoy them.This game have naval combats, but they are dumb as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean, you have to grind like a mad man to progress. I really do not enjoy this and I really do not make naval battles. You really do not need them to progress. So I suggest you skip this♥♥♥♥♥♥and probably come back when you reach your max level of lighthouse, which you can use total of 49 ships, with no upgrades. So yes, there is a ship limiter too.But it is nice to see your harbours with the many ships that come and go with resources, trade ships that come to deliver the goods or buy some goods.So I have unlocked all the buildings. This means that I have an island with more than 4000 nobles, which are really hard to get.Of course if you pay and get many gems, you will progress extremely fast.Overall I suggest this game if you have the patience to play it.

												In two words: Great Game.It's not your typical base building game. It's something more. A game that sharpens your mind, tests your strategic knowledge -as well as your counting knowledge-. A game with a wonderful community and helpful people. Don't mind the reviews made by people who've played the game for half an hour and say it's a pay-to-win game. It's a game you can play at your own pace, definitely without having to pay at all, unless you want to. 10/10.			"

												This is just a browser game that's been wrapped in this progam to put it on steam. Played the browser game a bit and here is my take on it.+Somewhat interesting city building, similar to real ANNO games.+Looks decent, for a browser game.+It can be played completely free*(see below).+The events are kind of fun, and you can get some microtransaction stuff.-Slow, like painfully, achingly slow. It starts ok, but it gets to the point of waiting weeks for materials and money to build a late mid-tier production chain. End game ones must be terribly slow.-Freemium for sure though. You can buy resources, money, build speed boosts, new islands. The largest islands can only be bought. If you want to power game, or don't like waiting weeks for something then you have to pay.-If you want to play free, then the in-game microtransaction store uses gems. You can get some gems for free, use them to get more gems if you save up. It could take you many months to make enough gems to buy a good island though.-Infrequent updates. I don't blame the devs, I blame Ubisoft for underfunding and understaffing and setting rediculous microtransaction requirements.-Ubisoft. I hate Ubisoft. I hate EA for killing Westwood Studios. I hate Ubisoft more, because they make some games I like but they make them painful to play, and they have such terrible customer service and a fairly open and negative opinion of PC gamers.-Eventually there comes a point where there is literally nothing to do. You have all resource chains running, houses upgraded, and there is no combat so that's it, you done. Of course that could take a year or more to get to... "

												I enjoy it. First off, it`s not P2W. Unlike nearly all free city building games it`s not pvp so you can`t spend real money to buy upgrades to your army. Graphics are fine, the gameplay is awesome and i haven`t need to spend a single euro on the game. It`s easy to get gold (Ingame currency) and the community is friendly.			"

												Don't let the ""Mixed"" reviews slow you down. Even though Dawn of Discovery is superior to this game, still... The community is friendly, and it's somewhat easy to get into. There's of course the game's base currency and a currency that you can get good stuff by buying it, but it's not P2W.			"

												Let me start by saying, I'm a huge Anno fan, ever since I played the demo of Anno 1602 when I was 8 years old and i got the game for my 9th birthday.I must have played 1602 for thousends of hours since then, I still play it sometimes and I still love it, it is one of the best games ever made.After playing the beta for Settlers Online, I was invited to the Beta of Anno Online and I was very excited to to see what it would be like.However I was hugely disappointed when I finally got to play the game,  they had just taken the Settlers Onlline browser game and given it a Anno theme.I downloaded this on Steam to see what had become of this game.They added a menu and some other new features since the last time I played but it's still not worth to be called an Anno game.As far as browser games go this isn't too bad, unfortunately it isn't good either.

												I have played the anno games since 1602 ad came out.  I am very familiar with these games., and they are very relentless with their game play, and the game does punish the player if the player forgets to feed their populace, or forgets to get jewlery for their aristocrats, and e,t,c,  This game feels like they dumbed it down.  there should be an option to forgo this intro thing where there is apop up for everything.  i would reccomend the game, but there should be apoint where you can drop the pop ups.

Außerdem hätte man statt den ""Missionen"", die sowieso den nächsten logischen Schritt des Spiels darstellen, doch einfach Erfolge einbauen können.

												Awesome game if you love to build your city, I already spent some decent hours, got so many these special diamonds for free just for doing quests. Don't need to spend any real money to enjoy all content... So I really like it. Don't understand why people complaining about this game.... OMG IT'S FREE TO PLAY! so stop complaining, sh*t up and enjoy the game  :) and for dummies who says it has bad graphics, please go to the settings, then you will see plugin settings, and switch from google chrome flash plugin on Adobe flash player plugin, then it will run smoother, better and graphics for my opinion will look awesome, just how it should look for the type of this game! And please stop giving the game bad reviews because you can't run it! If you are dumb and don't own the right plugin that doesn't mean the game is bad!!!!			"

There is only very little content for the endgame though. Definitly not ""Pay to win"", since there is no PVP (yet).Anyways, this client does not work at all for me (Ubuntu 15.04):-Cannot login with my existing account, have to create a new one-Game does not start when clicking the buttonOn Windows 8.1 it works, but is neither faster nor better in any other way than the browser-version. Don't see the point of the ""app"".And since I cannot even use my existing account I can not reccomend this App, though neutral would be more correct.			"

												It really is an interesting game, complex like simisle used to be.  I have had a slow processor and will now be playing on an 8 core amd with a low end (I think) geforce gt740 so we'll see how it goes.  At the moment, I can't get the darn game to start - it just freezes at the load screen after I press the play button.			"

												Played for a few months and the game is pretty fun but largely outdated.  A game to test your patience as everything takes days/weeks to do something unless you pay money.  The community is the only reason to keep playing.  No new content/events for several months and almost no communication with players on future events. It's 2 weeks till Halloween and they tell us to ""keep looking at the website"" to see if an announcement will happen.  The game's future is certainly in doubt with loss of Bluebyte staff and several mods.Customer support is only available to those who have spent money, and even then it looks like the support you get isn't very good.When your data gets inevitably corrupted, you have no way to get it cleared and have to restart a game.Update: This game is in Maintenance mode now. No new content/features/events in the forseeable future.			"

												I've been playing this game on browser since the last year. I'm still on lvl 15, and I can say: it's a good game. IMO, is the best browser-based game ever (since the others that I liked so much are dead now, like The Sims Social...).Also, I've never payed a single ""ruby"" (cash) in this game, and my island still growing. The secret is: play some minutes today, you money and resources will end and tomorrow everything will be filled again. I'm doing this since March 2015, and today I've almost 3000 rubys. There are after a contruction that ""create"" ruby, and with my calculations we can get she full upgraded without puting cash. After, maybe a single put, but i'm not reached this part.Good:- Graphics;- Music;- Gameplay;- It's FREE!The visual are pretty good, and I must say that this game ""relax"" me. The visual of the houses and the island itself as also very good. And the game is free, and the space is almost invisible to your hardrive. Bad:- A think nothing;Maybe the difficult. Is too easy for this kind of game, and we are talking about the ""Anno"" franchise, but this depends about your preferences.============================================================Maybe I reviewd this ""postive"" because I play on the browser for months, and is ""useless"" download trough Steam. Go play on your browser :v			"

												I really don't understand why people are hating on this game with the ""pay to win"" bullcrap when there is no winning. the micro transactions are there, sure, but for the 3.7 hours of playing this game i did not use a single penny what so ever... so you can spend your money for some rubies to speed the game up even though you can have a huge town  going in an hour, or PLAY THE GAME PROPERLY, which is funner then using moneyThe Pros and Cons+great art+soundtrack+Battling+multiple needs+expansive island+quests are easy and hard at the same time+great community, they can help you with a lot of stuff that you can get confused from-micro transactions-you can only have one mason in the beginning, which to me, is hard to get enough stone in a day- you can only have one account, so if you want to start a new one, you have to reset your accountrating: 8.7/10			"

No un-needed hassle with 3d-graphics, just the game itself with its own twists.Also one good point is, you don't need to use real money to play. You can, but it's not advertised all the time till you get annoyed by it.I recommend this to anyone who likes city building games with option to multiplayer. It also has nice people to help you start :-)			"

												Im recommending this game based on what it is, a f2p browser game.As such, its surprisingly well paced up untill you hit 250/500 merchants, after this it grinds down to a ""check once in while"" game. Its still far better than many/all mobile city builder games, those are horrific bad games that no one should ever pay/play ( so devs of such godawfull games never get any money and those games disappear forever, hopefully to be replaced by the likes of this or better).This game is fairly fun, it fills a niche ""check once in a while at work or when you have a small break from the kids"". for full builder game experience i play anno 2070, but often theres no time for a lengthy game of 2070, so i glance at anno online, spend whats accumulated and turn off again. Havent spent any money on it yet, and depending on how slow it gets i may never, if it keeps a good pace ill buy the starter pack to support the devs, but if it degenerates into a ""24 days to complete this or skip for 24 billion rubys"", i wont spend i daim, ill just keep on playing for free. Devs of these kind of games should set a limit on how long anything takes to get built/done and it should never exceed 24 hours, maybe 48 in some extreme cases as to not fall into the category explained above.browser game rating 8.5/10This may change based on future experince.

												Been playing this for a good bit lately and... it's pretty boring most of the time. Just building, waiting for resources, the occasional sea battle, and a repair period. Did I mention the waiting? Cause there is a TON OF WAITING! Wait for resources, wait for your buidlings to stop being full, wait for your scout to return, wait for one of your three burning ships to finish repairing so any other burning ones can be repaired before they sink, wait for the one that sank to finish rebuilding. For me, had to wait offline for a solid days worth of time before playing for a few hours and waiting a day again. If anything, I am guessing at end game when you have unlocked the entire island and have a continent worth of resources with a quick refill will the waiting stop for the most part. Still.... I want to play more.			"

												The city building aspect of the game is extremely addictive, and the simplified naval combat was just getting interesting.  All in all, this game is quite fun, and I would absolutely love to continue to play it.... *If* the User Interface would resize itself properly in the window.  I can't reach certain buttons half the time, because they are partially obscured by the bottoms of the game window, and resizing the window does *nothing.*The easiest fix for this would simply be to make the game fullscreen, but that doesn't seem to be something the devs were willing to do -- therefore ruining an otherwise wonderful game, IMHO...If you're willing to put up with partially obscured UIs and visually jarring windowed modes, then by all means, give this game a shot!  It *is* a well-made City Builder, but there are cleaner, better made titles available to choose from out there for reasonable prices.5/10 -- Removed from Libary "

												Where to start.... First, I gave this game a thumbs down because there isn't a ""Meh"" option.  It's not terrible, but there are definitely better games out there, and I never recommend that anyone waste their time.I tried really hard to like this game.  I gave it every possible chance to impress me..... but, no dice.  Frankly, it is under-featured, the gameplay is dated (at a date somewhere around 1991), and the development team seems so obsessed with controlling possibly offensive content that they have gutted any form or fashion of customization.  If you do play, take care choosing your nick-name, since it's the last thing you get to customize.  All island and ship-names are generated by the game.  So much for immersion.  I got saddled early on with two islands with the same name, and no options to fix it, which was prohibitively confusing, considering you have to coordinate shipping routes between these islands to grow the economy.  As far as city builders go, again, it's a ""meh"".  With no competitive play and the weakest PVE system I've seen in years, building and upgrading are monotonous and repetitive almost to pointlessness.  It was only a sense of ""this game can't break me""  that got me to care at all.So, now that the reason for the thumbs down is out of the way, here are the good points, kind of.  I have only played on the UK ""Mermaid"" server, so I don't know if all of these factors are consistent from server to server.The moderators:  The mods were polite, and as helpful as they could be.  Apparently, however, their powers don't extend much beyond kicking people from the chat and answering an occasional question.  Twice I have been told by moderators that they had no experience with the Steam Client, and thus couldn't help with Steam-related issues.  The players:  This is the friendliest, most helpful game community I have ever seen.  The global chat looks like a constant beginner's tutorial, as players take time out from their own game to answer questions and fill in the gaps for the un-necessarily cryptic quest instructions  and inadequate game documentation.  Why did I play for seven weeks?  Because the players were fun, even if the game wasn't.  The price:  It's free.  I have, however, played many, many much better developed free2play games.In the end, it's a shame, because there are building blocks here that could have been a really good game TWENTY YEARS AGO.  But, it's 2015, and experienced gamers (of which you will not find many on Anno-Online) have expectations of gameplay, challenge, immersion, and graphics that this game does not meet in any way.  I would seriously recommend to the developers that they play some of the games made by the competition, and get some idea of how a contemporary city-building game should look, play and work.Lastly, I am a longtime fan of Ubisoft games.  If you likerd their blockbuster titles, or even the Anno franchise, do not assume that this game comes anywhere close to the quality of those games.2.5/10  I might log in now and again to say hello to the nice people I met in chat.

												this is a fun game, but you have to keep in mid it is what it is. build a city and try your best to manage your resorces, gold wood stone fish ext... you will need to be good at the game or pay money in order to finish getting the islands and your first land you have. it should take around 6 mouths to get supper far, basicly done with the game and faster if you pay money. yes its set up like famvile where you just have to wait, but that doesnt make it bad. its a free game and im supprised it has such a bad review mostly because you have to have google crome. that shouldnt be a negative to a game. yo me thats like getting mad at haveing to pach for lol or wow. just doest make sence. linx on the other hand can make sence, and they might not be able to play at all. but then why are review the game becuase you cant even play it to know, how it is.

This is free play game where they want cash non-stop for their rubies and your all free time. No, just no, better buy real one and only ANNO 1404, believe me. This isn't bad maybe, look almost same, music and sounds same, but still, this is free and crappy game. Sorry. :) Only for those who don't have what to do or not want anything special.			"

												those whi say its a pay to win ?? win what??? there is no winning ... its a city builder and simple pve naval battle game. there are ranking lists though for those who like to compete. like an old fashoned high score. Anything which you can buy in the shop you can get in the game without paying a cent. you can earn and get runies in the game , sure its slower but its not a game you play overnight or in a week or even a month. its a long term game that you can play and enjoy for years , improving and building your city. The community on the server i play on (in the usa) if fantastic, very helpful. and yes its identical to the web based browser version except when you log in you can only access one server per account. in a web browser you can play on multiple servers , each one in its own world. it is a very addictive number chunching / time management game. there is always something to do , move stuff around to make it more efficient. collect the blue blobs of goodies that appear at times and every hour you get a ship coming in to give you more money. its a thinking game where you plan things and as you grow you have to move things around and keep supply and usage in ballance. there are lots of quests that will teach you and lead you through the game. in closing its by far one of (if not) the best FREE online browser game around. i have played many many over the years. its not a new game but is still being updated some people have been playing it since at least 2013All the negative reviews are from those that don't want to understand the game as its not their style of game thats fine, however there are lots of people out there that are expecting it to be the next great slice of heaven, and have pvp (which it doesn't) and thats the beauty of it the community helps players. theres trading goods on the auction houseI highly recommend it over games like evony etc. theres a lot more happening in it to keep your interest			"

												I just  got this game today and i have already played over three hours of it. It is so addicting and EXTREMELY fun. One of the best simulation games  i have ever played. It is such a good game for the price (free). Anno Online is in my top three favorite games. One of my favorite things about the game is the music; It is a great soundtrack. I personally like this game but if your not a big fan of simulation games i dont suggest you get it. The help chat is very useful and the mods are nice and will help you clearly. Anno Online is a great game.			"

												When I found this game, I was quite excited. Sounded like a pretty fun game to relax on. Then I read the negative reviews... That almost completely put me off, but knowing how Steam is, I looked at the posotive too and realised that pretty much everyone posting negative reviews clearly have some mental illness. Unfortuantely, when I tried to run the game, all I got when I tried to play the game was a black screen, forcing me to waste 5 minutes staring at a blank screen to write this. But, from what I've heard, it's a very good game. I reccommend this if you want to play a relaxing, medieval game that won't take 5 minutes to compelete, and you can actually spend your time on it to enjoy it, and watch your town grow. As for me, I will continue to try and get it to run.			"

												I really like Civilization and City-Builder games. I think they are great. One of my favorites is Dawn Of Discovery (America) or Anno 1404 (Europe) (Same game). If I must compare the two, Anno Online wouldn't be a bad game itself. But there is tons of Micro-transactions and the game uses models from Anno 1404 that are degraded and look like a game from the early 2000's. Now don't get me wrong, graphics aren't what make a game good. Its the gameplay. The game makes you wait to get resources, the furthest (My estimate) is that atleast 60% of people got bored of wating. After the tutorial you wait long times for stone. Now my list:Pros: Free to Play, Multiplayer, Good tutorial, Customizable icon, And that is about it.Cons: Bad connection problems, bad graphics, poor combat, lots of Micro-transactions, Its unstable, seems like a facebook game.Overall Score: 5/10			"

												I am a newish player to the game and had a bit of a problem with purchasing Rubies for this game for £7.22 and opened up a ticket about it, it was eventually fixed, however, I got an email stating that I have been blocked from playing the game for using a non offensive name. All this without warning, just an email sent outright stating that (Due to the nature of the name you have chosen, your account has been banned) All the while, I am £7.22 out of pocket that i have just spent on it. If this is how moderators of this game treat it's gamers, I am no longer interested in playing it.. I have asked for a refund since I got banned without any warning, they refuse to issue me with a refund and throwing ToS at me. As a new player to the game that's cheeky. Whatever problem the online support moderator has had with my username which of course offended no one but the online support moderator herself, it seems the folks looking after this game are all too good at taking your money followed by insulting you in this way. I am using the same username on some other game that is alot more social than this without any problems from such folk as this one. Since this game is by Ubisoft as well, it will definitely make me think twice before going for another game developed by this company in the future.			"

So Yah, Beyond that, The Game is good, Perfect, In Fact i played on the internet, before coming to steam, so yes...still a good game...			"

												There is no pvp...only PvE...just forget it if you need to ""pwn"" everyone with your ""L337N3SS""...ain't gonna happen here. Now, if you got past that part, first, take a look at my hours played. It's great. Relaxing. Fun. Great Community to help you through the worst of it all. It's not pay to win. Just will take a little bit more time than a player who can afford to unlock all their island slots with cash/rubies. If you played any anno games before this, specially 1404, then you'll know exactly what to do and how to do it. For newer players, follow the tutorials and the quests. They help and lead you into everything you're bound to ask within your first 5 seconds in-game. Take the advice of veteran players. It's just advice.  And many are very helpful and knowledgable about the game. The mods in-game are there to make sure people behave themselves. It's a clean, family-orientated  game. No trolls, no pvp leetness to contend with. Just some relaxing fun.			"

												Hello, I have been seeing negative reviews for this game saying ""OH WOW It is a flash game"" or ""It needs a web browser to function and flash."" I would like to point out that it says that its a flash game and usually flash games are on the internet. I would like to say this is a pretty good Medieval City Building Flash Game. I would recommend trying it out if you like building cities and have a good time with economy games.			"

												I love city building games and this one is particularly relaxing due to the slower pace, awesome soundtrack and nice graphics. The ship battles are a nice distraction now and then from building, organizing and planning your early Empire. I read that some people had problems with the server but I didn't experience such problems during the game. Sure, the game took a while to load but once it began, everything progressed smoothly. Plus, the game is FREE so that's a plus :)Play this game if you are not looking for time sensitive timed tasks and competition from other players. The music is very hypnotic and I just enjoy playing the game while doing other things.			"

												The game Anno Online is a game meant for those who have time to kill an enjoy the chat of a community. It is a game that early game placing buildings in a strategic way helps to advance your society quickly. Those who would call this game horrible are just not use to games that play like a city builder, but are completely online. Though the game has no PVP and is slow since it is online it can still be very enjoyable to those who try to enjoy the community. If you enjoy chatting with a nice community and city builders at the same time than I would recommend this game for you if not than just leave the game alone and move on.All those who would post negative comments upon this do no do such just walk away I do not care to have any messages about crap from negative comments on this.Sincerely,Eaglesword(IGN Galican)			"

												Not bad at all. A nice break from little kids raging and credit card players spending their savings to just make you quit. You build, chat with other players, and trade. Pretty simple and that's it. It's free and yes, you can spend money to buy things but you don't feel forced like most other games.			"

												When I had played the non-Steam edition a year ago, it was pretty fun.People think that you kinda need to pay for some micro-transactions, but this is an illusion. You can reach and unlock everything as a Free2Play-user. ANNO Online is absolutely 100% F2P!! Wanna have useless cosmetics? Then pay for them [...] Those are NOT needed/required for the gameplay at all.In my whole WWW history and life, I have had met the most friendly community within ANNO Online. It was unbelieveable. Well, I am talking about ""german servers"" and their german populations. I am not sure how the athmosphere is inside international servers. Older people as teachers, professors, etc, play this game too. For real!!ANNO Online has a nice support, too, as well as includes in-game moderators who watch out for ANY delicts as for a simple written bad-word. You can even add moderators into your Friendslist. ANNO Online is nearly infected-free. You had seen a single ""troll"" every 2nd week, but, well, with the release on Steam I begin to feel bad things for ANNO Online's future and its amazingly & friendly athmosphere. As its gameplay the ANNO Online community is unique, yet!!What I really liked in ANNO Online was the trading system with other players. You are able to mass-product beer for example and sell it via your harbor and ships. ANNO Online is one of the best F2P Browser game out there as well as it is PvE-focused. No PvP - No Win!! You can even visit other players islands and watch them live.As an ANNO fan, since its major relase with 1602 in the 90's, I have followed just everything about this genre. It is totally unique. ANNO 1404 and ANNO 2070 are masterpieces, and so is this ""Browser game"". I have never had any money problems in-game, you should learn to handle its unique economy. ANNO is so much fun.I highly recommend ANNO Online and its universe, and, please, ignore those yet ~20 bad reviews. You won't even feel that ANNO Online is a Browser game. After hours of gameplay in ANNO Online, you begin to feel to play it as it is a real ANNO game. There is so much more of positives to tell you about this game.Why have I stopped to play ANNO Online a year ago, but talking only the best of it? Well, there is a daily log-in bonus and on anytime later, after months of gameplay, I lost my daily log-in bonus progress due to a technical / server-sided issue. It got a reset to ""Day-0""!! The support wasn't able to revert it back to fix that. Every day.. for nothing.....I wonder if my account still exists there. I possibly try ANNO Online on Steam out, but later.BEST REGARDSN3EDIT_001:Don't trust any of these negative reviews about ANNO Online.There are too many ""trolls"" who vote down since they have no any clue. Thanks in advance.Most or nearly ALL of them don't realize that this is a ""Browser Game"" and...ANNO Online is 100% ""NO"" Pay2Win...#1: You can unlock everything as a Free2Play-user#2: PvE-focused#3: No PvP, no ""win""#4: Wanna have cosmetics? Buy them...#5: Unlock whole and huge islands? You can do this without paying any real money!!ANNO Online is all about fun and as a ""Browser Game"", of course time consuming.BEST REGARDSN3EDIT_002:I wanna show you an ""older"" ANNO Online screenshot about my ""F2P"" gameplay!!100% played without payed money... there is nothing different on the Steam Edition.+1337 income ^^http://abload.de/img/1337a5mpup.pngBEST REGARDSN3 "

												I am not sure why so many people are giving this game a bad review. I played this game for MONTHS before it got here on steam. I absolutely loved it. The community is super nice and the game made me want to come back every day to make my empire grow and run more and more smoother.YES there are a lot of microtransactions in the game but these only SPEED up the game for you; they are NOT necessary to ""win"". Any rubies you can buy with real money you can get by actually playing the game, but yes it will take some time.This game requires patience, and if you don't have it, but still love Anno, then play the other games in the series instead.

												these negitive reviews are from noobs who have no idea what p2w means.. Still trying to fiqure out how a game is p2w when its all pve and you can earn everything as a free users hmmmmm. The game is pretty legit and relaxing where you build and maintain a town... if you are into building games i would Highly recommend this game is any person into this kinda style of gameplay. Turns out that since I gave the game a good ""review"" I work for and or butt buddies with the devs. LOL as you can tell from the comments in the review it self that this is review bombing at its finest. I am not going to sit here and say this game is the greatest in the world I would by lying. There are some problems I see with it. But overall the game to me is fun and passes some time. Now before you get your butt buddies to spread ignorance like OMG YOU WORK FOR UBI OR THEY PAID YOU TO WRTIE THIS. Please feel free to go through my entire friends list and note the only devs I have on my friends list is A. Max from No More Room in Hell and B. Tyveris the dev from brawlhalla only because they are both really good people and make some great ♥♥♥♥ing games. Now DO you notice ubisoft people there ♥♥♥♥ no.  This review is based only on my thoughts and my thoughts only.			"

												Yes, Anno Online have micro transaction and will eventually get a lot more slower to advance. It is how those kind of games works. Yes graphics aren't ultra high quality.But if you liked to have those little facebook game to kill some time, well with Anno Online you can get it without the hassle to have a facebook account bloated with thousands of friend for the only sake of getting a new puppy in your game.It is not a huge management game, but Anno Online is fun. And at a first glance, the community seems interested in helping each others.Thumbs up fora game who got a lot more negative comment that it should.			"

												Take this game for what it is. If your looking for an Anno sytle game then this really isn't it, this is a flash based browser game with very limited functionality.F2P is debatable, you can play for free but with the new changes it's become more F2P P2W. If you want a simple city builder to waste some time get it, no brainer. If you want an in depth Anno style game, move on quckly.It is what it is !			"

												I've been playing this game for almost 700 hours and I'm not proud of it. But this game is incredibly addicting and you can easily rack up hours of free fun. The games shells out free currency for each week of continuous daily play in addition to a ton in the first few quests you play through. It also has regular server wide events that you can contribute to with the entire server or just your own guild. Its also got many ways to play that you can choose to do or choose not to do. - If you like turn based battles, its got that. Naval battle between you and pirates. - Leveled battle ships - City building - Colonization - Guilds - Trading with other players - Resource managementI highly recommend it. However, don't get into this game unless you have tons of free time, because this game will eat it all.			"

												Like most free-to-play games, Anno Online starts out at a brisk pace but after you have invested enough time to be interested in the game, it gets slower and slower - unless you spend money.  All ""free"" games have to make money somehow and walking that fine line between being frustrating enough to make you buy things and so frustrating you quit playing is the difference between success and failure.  This game can be played with no money at all, but only very slowly.Fans of the game like to point out it doesn't require money because there is no ""winning"" the game and that's true.   It's a city builder and that genre doesn't usually involve competition.  But it's a very repetitive city builder that goes at a snail's pace.  The advice one hears most often in the game's chat is ""patience"".Pros: the graphics are beautiful; the software doesn't crash; the chat and moderators are helpful and the first city on the first island is a lot of fun.  Cons: the game has lots of lag; only happy talk is allowed in chat; all the cities are just like the first city; the sea battles are repetitive and mechanical and endless; the trading ships are surprisingly underdeveloped - they goe A to B and that's it, plus, they have to be stopped and reprogrammed to make any change in cargo (takes half an hour); leaving the game unattended for a day invites disaster; the challenges are more inventory management than strategy.I played for a long time and that should cause a ""Yes"" recommendation, but to be honest, after the first couple of days I kept on playing more out of stubborness than enjoyment.  In retrospect, I wish I had picked a different game.  BTW the game takes so long to open I usually leave it connected all day so the hours I've logged are not actual playing time.			"

												Want to make a free to play timegate Anno game? Honestly I'm fine with that. The problem is everything else.The UI is clunky and unresponsive. The game performes terribly and has none of the hot-key and quick selection command tools 2070, 2205 and 1404 depend upon. This game simply does not want to be played.Edit: For context, I've put hundreds of hours into the latest 3 main series Anno games and continue to do so. Even 2205 for all of its problems is still fun to play. This is not.			"

												I thought I\'d try the game for a while.Upon release I already got tempted to play but never did. But I tried now.For nearly 11 hours I played this game. I\'m at 2k population now with a couple of colonists and I thoroughly enjoy it.It might still be a little early for me to review, but it\'s a positive one for sure.Beyond any expectations it immediately hooked me to the game after the first 15 minutes.Now, regarding micro transactions, I got tempted quite a few times already..I\'m not sure whether I will buy gems or not. For now gem production seems to go fairly quickly.Everything is achievable without having to lay down real money for it.It\'s too early for me to say whether this is full F2P or only partially.The graphics are not too special, nor is the combat. But it\'s a (steam ported?) browser game.It only requires a couple of MB to play and it needs flash, which is a pity. But hey, it works, and it looks okay.I also completely love the music. Really good job at that. It makes the game that much more immersive.Especially the female solo vocal. Wow!This review will probably be updated later on with a bit more in-depth arguments on why I like playing this game.As of now : It just got me interested and I\'d like to see my city grow =3I\'d give this an 8/10.Cheers,Nemesis Theory			"

I\'m at 2k population now with a couple of colonists and I thoroughly enjoy it.It might still be a little early for me to review, but it\'s a positive one for sure.Beyond any expectations it immediately hooked me to the game after the first 15 minutes.Now, regarding micro transactions, I got tempted quite a few times already..I\'m not sure whether I will buy gems or not. For now gem production seems to go fairly quickly.Everything is achievable without having to lay down real money for it.It\'s too early for me to say whether this is full F2P or only partially.The graphics are not too special, nor is the combat. But it\'s a (steam ported?) browser game.It only requires a couple of MB to play and it needs flash, which is a pity. But hey, it works, and it looks okay.I also completely love the music. Really good job at that. It makes the game that much more immersive.Especially the female solo vocal. Wow!This review will probably be updated later on with a bit more in-depth arguments on why I like playing this game.As of now : It just got me interested and I\'d like to see my city grow =3I\'d give this an 8/10.Cheers,Nemesis Theory			"

												Very good civilization builder.. I would add more military other then navy...I would make island exploration a little bit easier to achieve, and also I would make it more accessible to access other islands and colonize quicker, has good economy and is deffenatly a free to play game I would recommend  "

												If you can live with the browser pacing (which means you do some stuff, and then you log out, return later, do some more stuff, log out again... etc.) then the game should be fun for you.It is a nice relaxing thing you can do over the day. And for a browser game the complexity is higher than your casual ""Farmerama"" game.			"

												This product obviously is not on par with full PC versions of ANNO titles. I don't quite understand why people judge it as if it was of a same level. It is much more similar to increasingly popular mobile games. And it is free after all. I cannot say that I really like this game. It is OK. At one moment I realized that it is not really bad that this game keeps running while I am sleeping, working or doing other things away from my computer. And I don't worry about missing anything or finding my city in ruins upon my return. It is much more forgiving and less demanding than most mobile games. Is it P2W as many reviewers claim? Not sure about it. I played for over 8 hours at this moment, did not spend a penny, and never felt like I need to. And those reviewers have mostly less than 1 hour on record. Weird. I think this game is greatly underrated by extremely high expectations from acclaimed series. But it is free, so you don't really lose anything. So try it, I would recommend to try if you like city bulding and expecially if you played or play similar mobile games.			"

												Like most free-to-play games, Anno Online starts out at a brisk pace but after you have invested enough time to be interested in the game, it gets slower and slower - unless you spend money.  All ""free"" games have to make money somehow and walking that fine line between being frustrating enough to make you buy things and so frustrating you quit playing is the difference between success and failure.  This game can be played with no money at all, but only very slowly.Fans of the game like to point out it doesn't require money because there is no ""winning"" the game and that's true.   It's a city builder and that genre doesn't usually involve competition.  But it's a very repetitive city builder that goes at a snail's pace.  The advice one hears most often in the game's chat is ""patience"".Pros: the graphics are beautiful; the software doesn't crash; the chat and moderators are helpful and the first city on the first island is a lot of fun.  Cons: the game has lots of lag; only happy talk is allowed in chat; all the cities are just like the first city; the sea battles are repetitive and mechanical and endless; the trading ships are surprisingly underdeveloped - they goe A to B and that's it, plus, they have to be stopped and reprogrammed to make any change in cargo (takes half an hour); leaving the game unattended for a day invites disaster; the challenges are more inventory management than strategy.I played for a long time and that should cause a ""Yes"" recommendation, but to be honest, after the first couple of days I kept on playing more out of stubborness than enjoyment.  In retrospect, I wish I had picked a different game.  BTW the game takes so long to open I usually leave it connected all day so the hours I've logged are not actual playing time.			"

												Want to make a free to play timegate Anno game? Honestly I'm fine with that. The problem is everything else.The UI is clunky and unresponsive. The game performes terribly and has none of the hot-key and quick selection command tools 2070, 2205 and 1404 depend upon. This game simply does not want to be played.Edit: For context, I've put hundreds of hours into the latest 3 main series Anno games and continue to do so. Even 2205 for all of its problems is still fun to play. This is not.			"

												All in all Anno is not a bad game- it has all you want when wanting to create a city and then some. The game is fast paced so you got to stay alert or suffer being beat down by a pirate. I mainly enjoyed Anno for its fog of war while you build your city and your fleet- I never did get that  far as to build a fleet but Eventually I will. Hope you enjpouy Anno online as m uch as I did so get ready to take it to em. and good luck.			"

												I have would recommended this game, as I had built a very impressive island.  However, at the end of 2016, it stopped working.  No support has been provided.  This game is currently full of bugs as it will not even load despite having the correctly installed Adobe and/or Chrome add-ons.  Developers: FIX IT			"

												I opened it for the first time entered a Name and... ""An Error has occurred please refresh the page and try again""... I closed the game and restarted, about 7 times... I still cant get past the name selection, if it even shows up... the game seemed to have potential, but I couldn't tell you about gameplay...			"
