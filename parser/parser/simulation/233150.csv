												Luftrausers isn't a dogfighting game. Yes, you're in a plane and you're shooting down planes (and boats and blimps), but what it really is frenetic aerial bullet hell chaos. But what makes Luftrausers so good, besides the action and stylized graphics, are the controls. Your plane is insanely maneuverable, able to turn on a dime, reach top speed in a moment. That level of control makes a difference. It's one thing to weave between some bullets and return fire. It's another to swoop into a dive, deftly plummet through a hail storm of bullets, take out a projectile-spewing battleship, and pull up so close that the water's surface is flared up by your thrusters.It's one thing to shoot down some planes. It's another to maneuver your enemies into a tight cluster, cut your thrusters, and shoot the planes pursuing you while your momentum carries you in the other direction. (And it helps that just activating your thrusters is so satisfying, thanks to the awesome fwhoosh sound effect)It's fast, it's hard as hell, it's addictive. The music is great. The visuals are simple, yet suit the game perfectly, displaying all the information you need to know without cluttering the onscreen spectacle. Each new part you unlock feels different, a new tool to master, Luftrausers isn't the most complex game, but it's certainly one of the most addictive and satisfying I've played in a while. I'd say it's up there with One Finger Death Punch, in terms of a simple experience that's laser focused on delivering finely tuned fun gameplay. It's the kind of game where I'm instantly restarting upon defeat, to improve my skills, complete missions, unlock new parts.			"

												A fallacious argument regarding arcade games is that they're designed solely to take your money. If anything, arcade games make you value your money. Think about it, your life is represented by a mere quarter. With practice that quarter could take you anywhere you want to go. For most of us nowadays, the only exposure to arcade games is through the occasional port or MAME. We've lost sight of how much a quarter is worth. What a lot of arcade-style games get wrong is that they have too much content. They have a lot of fluff like epic intros, backstories, dozens of stages, freakin' level-ups. I don't play an arcade game for all that filth, I want a good challenge, I want the action to start seconds after I begin. Luftrausers understands what makes an arcade game work, and it's fantastic.So uh...there's a war or something, you're a pilot, and oh who cares? You're either very skilled or exceptionally lucky to survive five minutes of this hell. The goal is to fly around, shoot down enemy fighters, destroy their boats, wreck their aces, sink their battleships, obliterate their subs, and probably wipe out their airships. One element of a good arcade game is that you can grasp its mechanics and controls in seconds. The enemy numbers are overwhelming but dodging and returning fire is seamless and impeccably designed. Your goals are simply to improve hi-score, complete various missions, and unlock parts. Whoa back up, unlock parts? What is this? It's actually a very clever system. The parts in this game aren't just +1 to armor or +3 to fire-power. They change up the player's entire style and strategy. There are a multitude of weapon, body, and engine combinations. Finding the one that suits you is all part of the fun. For example, having a propellor equipped allows the player's ship to not take damage underwater. When the heat becomes a little too much, it's possible to duck into the sea for a quick breather. Couple this with the laser cannon and enemies can be destroyed while firing from underwater. Every combination leads to various changes in how every game is played, and with each attempt lasting minutes at the most, there's a lot of ideas to play around with.What makes this such a smartly-designed game is that it does a lot with very little. There are maybe 7 or 8 enemy-types in the entire game, but they're used just right to make every game feel fresh. Changing the parts of your ship or focusing on different objectives can also make every attempt feel different from the last. I've gotten more than a couple hours out of this tiny game precisely because it knows what works and runs with it.Definitely pick up Luftrausers if you haven't already. If you're the bundle-purchasing type it has to be in your library already. If not...well...oops? Grab it during the next sale, or buy it right now. Just play this game next chance you get, it's definitely worth it.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell airplane based game, being released on PC, PS3 and Vita in early 2014. Game play is quite simple, you are in control of a airplane and you have to take on hundreds and hundreds of other enemy fighters coming at you from all angles. This game allows your plane to fly in all 360 degrees. Your main weapon will shoot from the front of your plane, you also have to take into consideration things like gravity, stalling and drifting whilst dodging all of the oncoming enemies.  Initially the controls seem very hard to get a grasp of, but once you work out how the plane flies and how you are supposed to control it, it becomes almost second nature. I would say it took me at least an hour to get to grips with the controls. Graphically, the game has a very minimalist look to it. Whilst there is little detail gone into the planes and their silhouettes, you still feel like you are actually there in the skies shooting the planes down yourself.  They could of quite easily made this look like a many of the other flight games on Steam, I think its the graphics and art style that most people will remember this game for. There isn't really any story or plot to follow in LUFTRAUSERS. I also didn't really want one too; it's perfectly fine for a game not to have a plot I think. After all, your character can nose dive your plane into an enemy battleship, reap the rewards from it and move onto the next character without batting an eyelid. The game also has a kind of rogue-like feel to it, after each level, you are able to customize your plane with different weapons and armor, and you keep all of the updates even after you die, along with any levels and points you have earned. Eventually you'll get more powerful and be able to simply overpower some stages purely because your plane will be kitted up so much. LUFTRAUSERS is a very hard game. I have died countless times, you just need to get used to it - there is no way around it. But if you preserver through, you'll soon be able to break through that wall you have been pounding your head on for an hour and beat the challenges that are set at the start of each level.  In order for me to reach the ""end"", it took me just over five hours. For me it felt just about right as I think it would really start to get tedious if I had to keep playing. This is probably a game you will want to dip into now and then, and not do a full stint of it like me, to get maximum fun out of it, just play it for twenty minutes at a time. The game is also highly recommended you use a game pad too; I tried with keyboard and it was just horrendous to control. To sum up, LUFTRAUSERS is a nicely put together indie title with some interesting elements; bullet-hell fans will absolutely adore it, and this is really a good game to play if you have five or ten minutes to spare as no level will ever last longer than that. The price tag of Â£6,99 makes it an absolute bargain for anyone. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fun arcade shooter based on a flash game called LUFTRAUSER, and the aim of the game is to survive as a fighter pilot as long as you can while racking up points and achievements in the process. As you gain experience you'll level up and unlock new parts for your ship - such as lasers, thrusters and massive hulls - which change your playstyle.GO LUFTRAUSERS!

												Luftrausers is incredibly addictive.The short, randomized gameplay sessions mean that you keep thinking ""one more game!"" until you've spent hours playing. The way the health system is done means that you can always make a full recovery by cooling your fighter off for a few seconds, making the gameplay change rapidly from shooting enemies to fleeing for your life - which keeps things very exciting. The variety of fighters you can build also dramatically changes your play style, and keeps things interesting much longer.As awesome as it is, there's still not a lot of content. So I wouldn't recommend it for full price, unless you're really into shmups.			"

												I know I haven't played a lot of the game, but its simple enough for me to write a review on it.LUFTRAUSERS is a bullet hell arcade game where you play as a ship and you fly around using momentum and different types of weapons to take advantage of your enemies. Speaking of enemies, there are several different kinds to combat against. I want to keep this fairly short, so heres the pros and consPros:-Nice Aesthetic-Very good and Adrenaline pumping soundtrack-Solid and repsonsive controls-Variety of ship and weapon types-Solid enemy variety-Blowing stuff up feels goodCons:-Minimalistic options menu-Black bars on my 1920x1080 monitorEDIT: At first I wrote that the game had no options menu and you couldn't exit. I was completely wrong, I just never went into the menu. Its still very lacking and the black bars do exist. Anyway, LUFTRAUSERS is a great arcade style game that will keep you on your toes Buy At Full Price  "

 The good guys always win, right?	 Wrong. In Luftrausers, you play as the pilot of an experimental self-healing fighter plane during the second world war, the catch is, you're on the german's side. This piece makes you feel like a total badass as you tear up the sky with your hundreds of different plane combinations, each as unique as the next, and witness your foes drop like flies. But the game's no match for your eagle-like superiority, you say? You can try out the SFMT mode for a true test of ones aeronautical mettle. Luftrausers' addictive, one more try kind of gameplay spells a good handful of genuinely fun hours of playtime. For it's cheap pricetag in a sale, this game will definately have you coming back for more fast-paced action with its quirky interface, adrenaline-fueling soundtrack and glorious pixel graphics.""Luftrausers"" is a made-up word.

												This game starts very fun with polished controls and a great visual style. I enjoyed it for the first hour, maybe two, but in the end the sudden drop off in entertainment made me to not recommend this game. It wasn't without other issues as well... The game lacks a good progression/unlockable balance. There is overall goals and levels. But. Also each item (weapon/armor/boost) you unlock comes with it's own unlockable goals. This is honestly the only reason you would bother using most options beyond a one time try to ""see what they are"". Basically the system forces you to use items you don't prefer if you want to stay on track in your progression. But if like most people you find a weapon/armor/boost combo you prefer and ignore your other unlocks? Well, you run the risk of grinding your overall level progression up... Which changes the spawn rates of enemies. And that's where the balance is quickly lost when you start missing specific item goals. There's one ""right"" way to progress but even if you did it and methodically unlocked each upgrade's goals as you got them without wasted plays? I still doubt it would stay balanced! And let me be clear, this is not a complaint about difficulty...I like a challenge and this game gives it when you get a lot of enemies on screen at once. But the spawning balance just ruins a reasonable chance at a goal and turns it into a lottery. Luck isn't a challenge, it is just luck. Skill goes out the window. And you do get to the point where you tap out. The goals you have left indeed become purely luck based or based on enemy spawns that rarely if ever cooperate. The game goes from a steady two hours of fun challenges of unlocks and goals to a test of  your willpower to grind and grind with items you don't like until you literally get lucky and win the lottery. Which I guess points out one last flaw. Without the goals this game loses all of it's appeal. All of it. With runs so short it isn't rewarding in any way to just play for ""fun"" without a goal. An average run is well under a minute. This makes playing it like an arcade game just going for a high score both pointless and ultra repetitive. I definitely had some fun playing it. It was a challenge at times and the gameplay felt tight. It was a pleasure to look at stylistically too. But then the fun ended. Abruptly. Completely. Beyond being a throw in game in a bundle I wouldn't recommend it. The price is way out of balance with what you actually get; A way out of balance short game.			"

												Luftrausers is a small, arcade-style game that packs a punch... if that's the sort of thing you're into.The thing with Luftrausers is, not everyone's going to like it. I don't want to convince you that it's good, I want to tell you about it and let you make that decision. There is no story mode. There are no levels. It's one area, you fly around, you shoot as many things as you can, you die, repeat.First off, let's talk about that. It's a game about flying around in an advanced German fighter plane machine thing and shooting up the enemies. Various airborne and seaborne war vehicles will try to shoot you down. And, sooner or later, they will succeed.Probably sooner.Your controls are a surprising part of what makes the game fun. You have your propulsion, which will move you forward. You also have right and left, which will turn you. Gravity is a thing here, it's not your typical bullet hell. But gravity is what allows you to perform cool aerial maneuvers. Fly directly up, stall your craft, then fall down past your enemies and blast upward at them. Laying back into the propulsion at the last minute to fly off to the side and dodge a battleship's bullets, of course.Now, there are two things which add replayability, here. First, is the diversity in equipment. You begin the game with a basic machine gun, basic aircraft body, and basic propulsion system. As you go, you unlock four more of each, all of which completely change how your craft performs and operates. One type of propulsion lets you go underwater without taking damage. One weapon is a continuous laser beam which hinders your turn speed when in use. One body is a nuke which destroys almost anything around when you die. Which, actually, that last one's a ton more useful than it sounds.Which brings me to the other thing. Missions. Each piece of equipment has a series of missions attached to it. Complete one, unlock the next. These are things like destroying so many of something, or blowing something up with a full combo going. Some are a little more outside the box, but there you go. Once you complete all of the normal missions, one final mission unlocks, which must be completed in SFMT mode, which is, for lack of a better label, hard mode. This unlocks the first time you destroy a blimp. And good luck with that. You're going to need it. And you're going to need it even more when you actually start SFMT mode.Completing missions nets you skulls, and as you unlock enough or level up, you unlock new equipment. Once all of the equipment is unlocked, you unlock palettes. The basic palette is a sort of retro-beige affair. My favorite was the first one I unlocked, titled ""Videodreaming"", which is sort of indigo and pink, and honestly looks really cool. Most of the others I unlocked were eyesores, so there's a thing to be aware of.That's honestly about all there is to it. You swoop and loop and blow stuff up and complete challenges and unlock things. I wouldn't expect to get TONS of time out of Luftrausers. But a few hours would be natural. If that all sounds appealing, then check it out.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a challenging arcade shooter that makes you fight to beat your high score. There's no deep story or hero with a traumatic past here. Just you gunning down countless waves of scum who deny you the right to the skies. Here's a video giving you my first impressions of the game. Although given how short it is, you may be able to consider it a review.

For those of you who want a short and dirty summary, I'll break it down for you with pros and cons.+ Challenging gameplay. There isn't a point where you'll ever be bored with how easy something is.+ Great replayability. No game will ever play the same, especially when you throw in all the different plane parts into the mix.+ Lots of different playstyles. You can fly everything from a plane that spearheads through destroyers to a meaty clunker that fires a laser and poops bullets. + Smooth, responsive gameplay. Nothing feels clunky and everything responds when you do it.+ Every shade of yellow you can find is here. Bask in its yellow glory! (Though you can change the scheme when you level up, but why?)- Extremely short. After playing 3 hours, I've practically done everything in the game.- Some of the weapons just aren't as good as others in my opinion. The homing missiles seem to have a lot of trouble hitting their target, even massive destroyers that barely move. Limiting you to 4 at a time makes it even more frustrating when they don't hit what they're supposed to. The cannon is similar, as it only allows one shot at a time, and if you miss, you have a lot of downtime between shots. And in a game as fast-paced as this, missing happens often.- Sometimes enemies just don't spawn and come after you. It makes it hard to bump up combos and get more points, allowing the more interesting enemies trying to gun you down.- Sometimes the game can be cheap and send 3 destroyers at you at a time with a few ace pilots to boot. At that point, you're just not gonna live with the amount of things on screen.All in all, I recommend you pick this game up when you want an excellent time waster. Even when it goes up to 10 dollars, it'll still be worth it. But if you don't like the fact that it is so short, feel free to wait until it goes on sale. You won't be disappointed either way.			"

												It's a fun game, tight controls and fantastic music. And so much of it too!The thing is, it's really short. Like, really really short. I unlocked all plane pieces (save for 3) within 45 minutes. The 3 pieces I didn't unlock I assume you gain from destroying a Blimp, a rare and difficult enemy. Upon further research, it appears that Blimps appear randomly after a fairly easy prerequisite is reached. Some players report finding it within their first hour, some after 5. It seems like some kind of artificial lengthening to me.If this game is %50 or more, go for I guess. Full price is a bit much right now.			"

												I strongly recommend trying the original flash game before buying: http://www.vlambeer.com/?p=496This sequel essentially extrapolates the original's gameplay into various goals while existing in a singular world.Ship components are unlocked after completing these goals. The patterns of enemies remain roughly the same, with the exception of boss-esque appearances.The core gameplay is phenomenal, but the lack of variety comes as huge a disappointment. What about a mission-based system, or campaign? Different missions with combinations of the enemies. One level could be entirely naval-based, another strictly dogfighting ... the list goes on.To conclude, if you enjoy the original flash demo, go for it, but don't expect much more than the challenges and ship mods.

												What I did in Luftrausers:- Flew really high into the sky from a pack of fighter planes, turned around, and then blew them all up with my â¥â¥â¥â¥ing laser- Used the melee body to run directly into a giant fighter plane to blow his â¥â¥â¥ apart- Skipped across the sea like a jet-propelled skipping stone to run into ships on the sea, ramming into them with said melee body to destroy their sucker asses- Dove into the sea like a dolphin, surfaced back into the air in front of a ship, blasted it with my machine gun until it died, then dived back into the ocean. DON'T â¥â¥â¥â¥ WITH DOLPHINS.- Intentionally dived in front of the enemy fire of a battleship to blow my plane up, setting off the nuke I had on board to blow up that battleship and his stupid battleship friends. Stupid battleships.Also you should really get this game, it is loads of fun. It's probably short in terms of actual progression if you're Skip Rogers but it's â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ tons of half-strategic half-manic fun if you just play to shoot everything.			"

												Looks a bit like Sopwith, controls a bit like Asteroids with gravity.  It feels good to fly and shoot in this, and in general the feedback for your actions and status is good.  The choice to make this game look like military profile diagrams fighting in a newsreel makes it easy to see what's going on, but they've managed to put nice details in like the turbulence of your plane kicking up spray off the ocean.  All the parts you can customise your plane with are distinct and force different play styles.It's a solid foundation for a good game, but the scoring and enemy spawning system is screwed up and destroys any appeal to seeking high scores.  Luck will determine if you can carry a full score multiplier (and it's a big multiplier) because sometimes small planes and boats don't spawn often enough.  Sometimes four or five big, deadly planes will spawn at once and spell doom for all but a few specific plane part combos.  The game derives its longevity instead through hiding the different plane parts behind missions, many of which only ask you be persistent than skillfull (accumulate X points over however many tries it takes).  You're going to notice the game's problems well before you get the last part.			"

												Look at the video for Luftrausers, where you can have a bunch of fighters chasing your plane, cut the engines in mid air, spin around, strafe them, and zoom off in the opposite direction. Yes, Luftrausers does let you be a crazy plane badass. Sadly, that's about the only good point.The whole thing feels like an Iphone game, but brings almost enough excitement that it could qualify as a real game. Runs are short. You'll die within 5 minutes, easily. The score system is arbitrary and meaningless for the very same reason I cannot recommend the game.Beyond the fighters, every other enemy simply takes too much damage to kill. By the game you have made the five or so passes needed to kill a battleship, three more have spawned, and they will ALL be training their sights on you while you try to kill the others. And you have boats, planes, subs, and jets to deal with while you're trying to ice these. The score system relies on a chaining mechanic and every single tough enemy takes more damage to kill than it takes your chain to drop, so you can only hope to play for score by hoping the RNG throws you a bunch of suicidal popcorn fighters and jets. The big bad blimp boss of the game is a total pushover unless you have to fight it while two dozen battleships also try to nail you from below but he may as well take twice as much sustained fire as you have put out since the game started to get him to show up and fight. The enemy variety is just tedious and sucks the fun out of the game beyond that initial rush where you duplicate the preview video's cool tricks.Like an Iphone game, you can do three objectives each time to unlock parts to customize your plane and they're really the actual goal of the game as they block all the unlocks and provide you the only sort of direction you get beyond getting shot at. The plane parts are roughly 25% cool, 75% stupid, and share the same loose, uninspiring design as the basic game. Some change core mechanics in fundamental ways but they are not enough to save the game.$10 for a tight arcade experience would be a no brainer but Luftrausers just does not have that spark that makes an arcade game fun. You won't come back to it months later to revisit the fond memories. It burns out too quick and does not leave much beyond the flash... Which is a shame as a lot of love and care went into the glitz and the flash and the style of it but a little more should have went into tightening the gameplay.			"

												This is a bit of a cautious recommendation. I will say that the game is pretty fun on its own, with an interesting theme going on. It's basically a bullet-hell game (with, I'd argue, some rogue-like elements). Point of the game is to las as long as you can over dangerous waters, fighting bots, planes and Zeppelins. I will say that the gameplay is really solid and interesting; you'll be flying all over the place while shooting, and can even cut off your engines to pull off maneuvers to get the edge on your enemies. It's a good arcade experience that you should have some fun with, and that's added with the unlocks that you get from completing challenges. The unlocks include new bodies of the plane, as well as weapons, wings, and engines. These pieces have their own stats, but also have a few interesting quirks, an example being an engine that shoots bullets. With the customization, it's a good bit of fun.So why is it cautious, you ask? Well, what cuts this game off from being great is its price at ten dollars which, in my opinion, is very overpriced. While the action is hectic, you'll be fighting in the same area and with the same enemies over and over and over again. On top of that, while the unlocks are great fun, there are too few to unlock (I got all of them at the 1.5 mark). It really isn't that hard to get all of the items in this game. Once you unlock all of your parts and essentially the hard mode, the only thing to strive for afterwards is completing challenges (which kind of loses its luster once everything is unlocked). Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game, but I'd highly recommend you buy it one it's on sale. Got my copy on Chronogg for a dollar fifty, which I think is a much more fair price. All in all, a fun game, but doesn't offer enough for its asking price.			"

												 Well first off let me say that the experience of playing Luftrausers cannot be described nor felt via screenshots.. Videos might give you some idea.   I used to play the prototype flash game for hours and that was without any upgrades or any of the new stuff.  The minimal graphics are amazingly detailed, from debres and shrapnel flying from your plane and enemies, to smoke and bullets and even water dripping off after you splash down. The controls are very solid, and relay the power and abilities of the chosen engine well.  High tech engines feel snappy and powerful and the odd-job (bullet) engines feel sluggish and less responsive.  Once you learn to steer well, the game really opens up and is amazingly entertaining.    Well that is until a jet screams onto your screen and smashes you into tiny pixels. I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys shooters, bullet hell, action rogue-lites. And since a friend of a friend saw on some forum that this is a free flash game, let me set the record straight.  It began life as a ULTRA simple version of the current game a long time ago. And while the prototype is still available, the full version adds missions, and level / upgrade system and many more enemies and is totally worth the few bucks.  Although the prototype will give you a basic feel of how the game plays (keyboard and mouse only I believe) the full version offers controller support. And I mean, who doesn't want to support some of the most awesome indie devs around? 9/10 Anyday.			"

												This is a brilliant little arcade style game. Incidentaly I picked this up in a Humble Bundle, but already before I start this review I'd say that it is definitly worth full price!Luftrausers is an oldschool arcade style game, with focus on racking up as many points as possible, while sustaining a multiplier. To do this you gun down hundreds of planes, ships, and various modifications and bosstypes of these.The game does however feature some progression, in that you will be offered various jobs to complete, and by doing that you will progressively unlock parts to your plane, which comes with more jobs to do. There is also colourschemes to unlock,  since the artstyle is uses a simple 4-5 colour pallette.The unlockable parts gives a whole lot of vararity, and there's a bunch of different playstyles, depending on how you combine your plane. Personally I'm a big fan of the laser+melee body+booster engine combo.Gameplay continues to be fun, and even after you have completed all jobs and unlocked all parts, there is more to do, a hardcore mode will unlock, which is really hardcore. You will basically die within seconds, and this mode comes with additional jobs to do.Luftrausers is ultmatively a bunch of fun, with flying mechanics that feel really awesome, and gamplay that keeps on giving. It does however run in some wierd aspect ratio (most likely 4:3) and there is no way to make it wide screen as far as I have seen, but this doesn't really detract from the game in any way.I would definitly reccomend this game if you are into arcade style games with scores and multipliers. Or if you just want to waste some time shooting thing out of a brown sky.Go get it!			"

												I honestly wanted to like this game, I did. And it WAS fun, for about 30 minutes - that's pretty much exactly how long you will need to see all LUFTRAUSERS has to offer. If you decide to play on, it will be because you want to grind out the achievements and not beacause there is a lot of fun to be had. A typical round of LUFTRAUSERS will last up to two minutes and it will not differ from the last round at all. The spawn patterns of your opponents seem utterly random (which makes chasing highscores rather tedious) and the drag we all feel, when we play games that just do not seem to progress in any way, will quickly set in.If you want to support the developer, buy NUCLEAR THRONE which is fantastic.

												If you're like me, you might be always wondering if there's something hidden within this game. I always thought this game looks really simple, too simple, from the previews. But it got such good reviews. Is there something else hidden within?Answer: There is not. It's exactly how it is in the previews. It's a gravity-based shmup, with multiplier-based scoring, stylistic and simplistic artstyle with one sephia shade within one stage without any story at all.But â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ it is fun. The shooting is really satisfying, unlocking new parts feels really make a difference, and the contextual bgm really kick-â¥â¥â¥.This game is really the crowning achievement of ""Let's play this for five minutes... whelp it's 1 hour already.""But there really isn't many content in this game, so that's that. After you unlock all parts and do all missions (challenges), you only try to beat high score. Strangely, I think this game would be more fulfilling to those who are not that good in this kind of shmup game, because they'll have longer time unlocking everything. But of course shmup veteran would get a kick from trying to beat high scores.Basically, recommended, but buy this discounted if you're concerned with the small amount of content.			"

												This is a review for the Linux version, running Ubuntu 14.10. Runs perfectly on linux, only minor issue is lack of an exit button. I was hesitant to pick this game up, due to the artstyle that seemed lazy in the screenshots and the general simplicity of bullet hell games. I was expecting this to be a cheap ""So retro"" game. However, when it went on sale and I noticed it was published by Devolver Digital (who have yet to back a stray horse) I decided to give it a go. I'm glad I did and I would recommend this game at full price.This game reminds me of old arcade classic Aerial Dogfight, except with everything turned to the max. You begin with only the most basic machine gun and engine, then when you die you've discovered that you have a new engine that lets you move twice as fast at the cost of turning speed, a few more deaths later you're erupting out of the ocean and obliterating everything with a laser strapped to a chassis which is a nuclear bomb.The game offers a lot of upgrade potential, it's surprisingly balanced. There's no combination which felt leagues better than the rest, Although your basic machinegun, chassis and engine feel outdated by the end, nothing you have earned will feel pointless.The constant flow of gameplay challenges associated with each weapon encourages you to diversify your tactics. This prevents the fact that the game only offers one level and one mode from becoming tedious. One downside of these challenges is that the curve on them is a little bit off. The final challenges are magnitudes more difficuklt than the ones that came before it, and something such as defeating a submarine at MAX combo feels far more luck based than it does skill based.The only real downside I could say against this game is that once you've completed all the challenges, there's not much to do but try for the high-score. That's not even a problem either with a relatively short round time and tight polished gameplay. I can see myself coming back to this many times in the future.			"

												It's a bullet-hell, Asteroids-like game where the objective is to blow up as much as possible, as fast as possible, and while scoring as much as possible. There are customizable ship parts, which allow for dozens of combinations to dramatically change the playstyle of the gamem, which helps greatly with the replay value. One game you can be a tanky destroyer that launches devistating cannon shots and the next you can be a supersonic melee ship that doesn't need to fire a single shot. Go for it if you like high score games, but beware it's tough as nails when you first start. It doesn't explain much and it has a terrible menu and interface. Getting to a menu to quit is a lot tougher than it should be when you first get into it and the game starts out with a 'tutorial' before you're presented with an option to change settings.			"

I'm not sure why they haven't made the soundtrack available on Steam, but I have seen one available in music bundles.As you try to stay alive, you can also attempt to complete missions to unlock upgrades. These range from easy (kill X enemies) to challenging (kill the feared Blimp!).There are different upgrades for Gun, Hull, and Engine, as well as a randomizer option.If you like shooters, you will probably like this!

												LUFTRAUSERS is a very enjoyable simple game that's astonishingly addictive. You are catapulted into the air and gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to survive. If you die it's game over, but depending on your plane you can take a number of hits, some plane types more, some less. When you stop shooting you regain health.During the course of the game you unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different engines. You can modify your plane by combining one weapon with one type of fuselage and one engine. This leads to various different plane types, some fast, some slow, some able to swim, some more agile, some more damage resistant.By killing enemies you gain points. Killing enemies in a sequence increases your multiplier. Higher multipliers mean more points.For each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, or a blimp, or killing a submarine with maximum multiplier, etc.It's fun to complete the challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun.			"

												8/10Overview: Shoot Em UpThe Good:+ Simple, clean art style that fits the style of the game+ There is only one ship that you can customize between 3 body parts- Weapons, body and engine. There are 5-6 parts in each category depending on how many you unlock, giving you well over 100 different combinations. Each body part is unique and provides its own sets of strengths and weaknesses depending on your play style. + Every body part you choose has 5 bonus objectives for you to complete giving you something to play for other than a high score. For example certain objectives may include 'kill 5 planes in one play session', 'destroy a battleship', 'kill a ship at max combo etc'. + The game has the ""one more time' feeling. The game can be very addicting as you try to get new high scores or complete objectives+Two difficulty modes to test your skills, normal and hard+Solid SoundtrackThe Average:The UI leaves something to be desired, it could have been a lot easier to navigate menu screens. Given the context of the game there really is no reason to have a UI that isn't simple and easy to navigate. The game can be very short if you don't care about achievements or high score, getting some of the bonus objectives can be time consuming and not worth the hassle. Conclusion:I am not the biggest fan of Shoot 'em ups but this game is the perfect pick up and play arcade game to kill some time. Its highly addicting and trying out all the different ship parts to find the right combination that fits your play style is part of the fun.  "

												Luftrausers is fast-paced bullet-hell dogfighter game; you are a plane and you shoot down other planes, missiles, ships and blimps down. Your objective is to survive as long as possible, taking down as many opponents as you can. Game is hard, death can occur within seconds of starting and your score is ranked online.Moving left or right will change the direction your plane will face, pushing up activates the boosters, and trigger fires your weapon. There is no limit to ammo. Controls are tight, dodging bullets and shooting the enemy has you switching your boosters on and off. You take damage by being shot at by the enemy, flying into enemy planes or ships, and staying too long in the clouds or water. All damage can be repaired by not firing for a few seconds.  You start off with a fast balanced plane, accomplishing objectives tied to your loadout (you can alter the engine, guns and body) and levelling up will unlock new choices. The new body, engine and gun types can be mixed and matched for different combinations, each giving a different play style; turn your ship into a battering ram, attach heat-seeking missiles, drop bombs on enemies below or sink into the sea without taking damage. There are many combinations to try and they do a great job in stopping the game from going stale.  Default colour scheme is light brown, dark red and white; different colour filters can be unlocked (though none of them are to my taste). Music is very good and the sound effects have a nice 'oompf' feel to it. If there is anything I would like to change is that a few more load out options would be welcomed and the cutscenes would be a bit longer. TL;DR: hard but fun bullet-hell game. One map, but made highly replayable by combining different parts of the plane.			"

												Another addictive game!!!The saying ' A second to learn, a lifetime to master ' is a very apt way of putting this game.You control a plane and the objective is to kill as many jets, planes, battleships, submarines etc as you can, rack up the points aided by reaching a max combo. The controls is what makes this game brilliant, it will certainly test your perception, timing and skill to avoid the barrage of gunfire whilst maintaining your kills to max out your combo for a serious score.The controls are similar to that old skool game gravity, where you control a small space ship and you have to land it on the landing pad.....right left and down will spin your plane whilst up is your thrusters to fly. Very tricky to master but allows for endless fun in trying to become the best!Steam achievements supported, also you have in game targets to reach for example, kill 20 jets in one game or reach a score of 5000, when you reach the criteria you can unlock different guns, plane bodies and abilities for your plane that gives you over 100+ different combinations of plane to fly with. Whats better is that every single different combination of aircraft has its own challenges to achieve!!If your an old skool gamer at heart, this is a no brainer and a must have!!!!! Tons of replayability and content to keep you busy.....question is, are you good enough to be the best Luftrauser?			"

Pretty simple, pretty hectic gameplay, pretty insane, and on that note, insanely fun to play.The gameplay is controled with 4 buttons; left, right, boost and fire. These buttons can be configured to your liking in the options menu, and you can even play with a gamepad. The goal of the game is to eliminate as many enemies as you can before you get shot down. Fortunately, you don't die in one hit; instead, the game makes a shaded circle around your plane indicating your health. The closer said circle is to your plane, the lower your health. You can recover health by simply not firing, but this means you'd potentially lose any scoring combos you had going, encouraging high-risk, high-reward gameplay while not penalizing you for playing it safe. The missions (i.e. subquests that unlock parts for your Luftrauser) start out simple, but quickly get tedious, annoying and often luck-based; as such, I would not recommend this game for hardcore completionists. However, it's fairly easy to unlock all ship parts relatively quickly (except for the final ultimate Luftrauser obtained from 100% mission completion), allowing for flexible gameplay that can suit your playing style. In conclusion, Luftrausers is a fast-paced aerial shootout that only loses its fun value if you focus more on completing the missions for achievements rather than obliterating every enemy you see.

												It's an diverting arcade-style dogfighting game, quite reminiscent of an old school game from the Amiga days called Air 2 Air. However, it is extremely short - each game typically lasts only about 2 minutes and after about half an hour, you'll have unlocked every component and seen every enemy the game has to offer. It's fun while it lasts, but there's nothing particular deep or complex about it. Grab it while it's on sale but I wouldn't pay full price for it.			"

												I haven't had this much fun with an arcade game since Geometry Wars.  The different jet combinations, unlocks, and missions drive replay just fine, but the real reason you keep coming back is this game just plain feels GOOD.If you want to try the game before you make an investment, head over to the Vlambeer site and play the prototype, ""LUFTRAUSER"" (URL: not.vlambeer.com/luftrauser).  Its a bare-bones version, but it lets you get a sense for the gameplay, which the full retail release expands upon greatly.			"

												Simple, tight controls and great pixel graphics make for a distilled, pure-gameplay experience. The icing on the cake is the way that the great synth-heavy electro soundtrack modifies itself slightly to compliment the weapons, body and engine you install on your plane.			"

												Luftrauser is a game of physical expression on a two-dimensional plane.Luftrauser reminds me of three of my all-time favorite games from the spatial-awareness-shooty genre:1. In Triplane Turmoil, momentum is everything - you have a narrow band of space between ground and sky, and your job is to occupy that space without getting shot down.  You have to maintain motion to keep from nosediving into the rocks, but a good pilot can stall into the perfect place to shoot their sibling's plane and pull out of the dive without taking damage.2. Crimsonland is top-down bullet hell done right - the ""bullets"" are zombies, and the only long-term way to dodge them is by killing them.  The only way to kill them effectively is to internalize the dodging mechanics so that one half of your brain handles the feet, weaving around the monsters, with the other half of your brain working on aiming in such a way as to make sure that you can keep dodging a few more precious seconds.3. It took me a few hours to catch it, but Luftrauser also reminds me of Uniball.  Uniball is soccer with spaceships, a weird futuristic air hockey viewed from the top down.  As a younger man I dedicated thousands of hours to playing online, but when bored I would even fire up the ""single-player"" mode without any other players, just to practice dribbling and moving.  Momentum is a huge part of the game, and I would practice shooting and passing while constantly spinning, limiting myself to only a few direction keys to force myself to use momentum with perfect efficiency.Luftrauser is an arcade-intense game that asks you to dodge with one brain, use your other brain to shoot speedy bad guys out of the air (with MAX COMBO), and if you're really leet, gives you a spatial playground to express yourself in with all the spinning, stalling, and lasers that my childhood gamer's heart so deeply desires.And also the soundtrack is super-awesome, the aesthetics are gorgeous, and the upgrades and goals are excellently crafted and all that other stuff.  But really, that's just the devs showing off after creating a beautiful Game.			"

LUFTRAUSERS is a high quality shooter that draws similarities from Asteroids and rogue-like games, but has enough of it's own mechanics and traits to make it's own game. It's red and sepia Gameboy style color makes it look like no other game, it's loadout based soundtrack can diversify your runs, and ""maybe German Nazi"" protaganists gives the game a unique look, without actually making any direct references to Nazi Germany. LUFTRAUSERS is very challenging, but generally fair and has enough content to merit it's retail price.LUFTRAUSERS is a game that I love, but will probably never be good at, thanks to it's propelled ship gameplay that is similar to Asteroids, where instead of directly moving the ship like a twin-stick shooter, you pivot the ship and then thrust when needed while it is in constant free fall. Your ship can take some damage before death and will even heal itself if not hit. You will maintain your current damage if you shoot, so you may want to stop your firing if you are damaged.  You must manage your movement to avoid the sea and cloude damage zone, as well as damage from enemy vessels and weapons. The sea and clouds can damage you, but not directly kill you and eventually force your ship out back in to the playfield - allowing for tactics such as hiding from bullets or running into water craft, since your ship can take some damage depending on your ship customization. An enemy kill increases a score multiplier that will go away after a few seconds after no kills and will max out at 20x. You have one life, and once you die, your run is over. Ship customization is important - it determines how much damage you take, how fast you move, how you shoot, and other interesting abilities such as having an engine that moves by shooting bullets behind you or a Nuke body that destroys multiple enemies when you die on your run. This also changes the music track of your run, as every possible ship combination has it's own unique and/or remixed chiptune-esque track.The game is run based like a rogue-lite, so expect to die often and try different ship configs for potentially more success. However, each ship configuration has it's own goals such as killing a certain amount of enemies, getting a certain amount of points , or just lasting long enough.  Completing goals will unlock more parts for you to mess around with. LUFTRAUSERS is a really solid game, though it's difficulty and maybe it's control scheme hasn't kept a ton of players - my high friend hours played is over 3hrs, and I'm the guy who plays lots of shoot em ups. It's a successful game for Vlambeer and definitely has that ""Devolver Digital quality"", but I feel only hardcore shmup fans and rogue-like fans will get the most value out of it. "

												LUFTRAUSERS! Sorry, Iâve been told by publishers Devolver Digital that LUFTRAUSERS must only be shouted when mentioned. That is true, because LUFTRAUSERS is something to shout about.LUFTRAUSERS is an indie arcade shooter by developers Vlambeer and the objective of the game is â¦to shoot everything! Presented as a 2D side-scrolling âwrap around screenâ shoot âem up similar to old-old school games like 80â²s Defender or 90â²s Jetstrike your mission is to take to the skies and dodge, dip, dive, duck, dodge and finally BLAST anything thatâs BLASTING at you! Enemies will come at you from all directions and in various forms. Ships, carriers and subs take pot shots from the sea and a menagerie of exotic planes (and a Zeppelin!) in the air that will engage in dog fights with you (or try and suicide themselves). As you progress things become more and more hectic to a dizzying degree as the amount going on at once escalates exponentially over 100 levels.Thankfully as you play the game you complete challenges, level up and gain access to more and more aviation unlocks. In total 125 different combinations of weapons, armour and propulsion systems become available which vary wildly from thicker armour (which naturally gives you more protection, but then decreases your speed), guided missiles (that chase your target but only limited to shooting 4 at a time) or the more wacky âengine that fires bullets when you flyâ. This diversity is a unique selling point of the game and getting the knack of each loadout and finding the best configuration to suit you or the scenario is key. For example Iâm currently sporting an anti-gravity engine to stay in the air with minimal thrust, a laser which is less powerful than the machine gun but allows for constant damage over time and a light chassis to boost myself out of trouble â¦which is frequent.Another plus is that the controls are minimal. No beefy manual on aeronautics or diploma for aerospace engineering required here lads! For the PC version of the game the up arrow gives you forward thrust, left and right turn you in a clockwise or counter-clockwise movement and âXâ fires your gun. Stop firing, and your plane repairs itself. Double tap thrust to give you a boost to (hopefully) speed you out of trouble. Simple? Well doing this under fire and the pressure of needing at times some pin-point precession of Maverick, itâs tough and times quite unforgiving.Visual wise LUFTRAUSERS is presented (for the most part) in a sepia scheme. Images are simple and suitably retro, fitting to its heritage, while audio is catchy and 16-bit. The audible tone to indicate your planes damage and repair progress is a particularly nice touch as it allows players to not have to rely on a visual cue (such as a 100% bar) that could easily be distracting especially when so much is going on.Overall LUFTRAUSERS is another great example of an indie title that Iâm sure will be recognised for its achievements. Itâs (Warning: Indie Game ClichÃ© Alert!) easy to learn, fun to play, cheap (which is important in this day and age) and has a good re-playability. Recommended if youâre a fan of the genre or have the change and looking for something to while away your time with when not wanting to drop robots from the sky.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS contains some of the most clever mechanics design and balancing you're likely to have seen for a while. Though there are only really three mechanics (Rotate, thrust, shoot), the way they fit together is stunning; releasing thrust is crucial for avoiding enemy fire, and you can only repair damage when you aren't firing yourself. The end result is both chaotic and balletic. Add to this a superb metagame, where you unlock new parts by completing micro-challenges, and it's hard to recommend this game enough.			"

												Game is just an arcade shooter that doesn't justify the price. There are multiple plane combinations that you can make, the incentive being that different parts have different missions. However, the ""random"" generator is so broken that the game forces you to fly around endlessly, hoping that just the right thing spawns at just the right time. For example, when trying to complete a ship killing mission, almost no ships are spawned, Or when trying to more than one of a specific enemy, the there are never more than 1 available. Combine this with â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ random situations like have a sea full of battleships (making flying impossible) and it just feels like the game is broken.Buy this if you like dodging bullets for hours on end, but I would wait for it to drop to under $2 for it to be worth it			"

												I can't avoid getting excited about this game. It was one of the best surprises I got from a Humble Bundle pack. Just randomly installed the game without knowing anything about it and... what's this? It's... it's...It's AMAZING!The controls feel very, very responsive. The gameplay is challenging but perfectly balanced. The amount of weapon/hull/engine choices are really varied but not THAT many, which in my opinion is perfect for the player to get to know and try each of them.The graphics: PERFECT! Simple and minimalistic yet when the screen is full of enemies shooting at you, it looks more than epic.And a huge, huge thumbs-up for the soundtrack, there's a moment when you're dodging bullets and the music kicks in that makes you forget about how ""outdated"" the game might look and places you right inside the cockpit of that monstrous war-machine you're piloting.PLAY THIS GAME NOW!

												Luftrausers is an action game where you fly an aircraft while completing missions and unlocking new parts. The goal is to get the highest score, by avoiding incoming rockets, planes and bullets. Kill enough enemies in one combo or reach a certain score and you'll unlock new parts for your aircraft. These parts might just help you get an even higher score. The parts are finely tuned and expertly balanced, so for example, increasing your damage might just make your aircraft fly/manoeuvre slower. You have to take things like that into account before taking off. You can adjust your engine, your weapon and your body and there are plenty of parts to unlock and use. Luftrausers is a fun game with some good music that's probably best played in smaller sessions.[Rating: 77/100]			"

												Luftrausers is an unexpected gem that feels like an arcade classic right away. Super tight controls combined with excellent music and sound effects make this a killer indie title.  Whats crazy is how the low resolution is one of the fun quirks in the game - I run this on my 60"" linux HTPC at 1080 in DTS surround sound and it feels awesome. The gameplay is simple but mastering the controls, sound cues, and getting all the achievements - is quite difficult. I would recommend a controller. Luftraisers is an indie title that really delivers at full price: 9/10.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a good little shmup where you play a perenially outmatched dieselpunk fighter pilot in a series of sea battles. Tense gameplay with tight controls, heavy replayability, a gorgeous aesthetic, and awesome music combine to make a great experience overall. I don't usually care for bullet hell, but this game pulls it off with enough style that I made an exception.The only problem is that the game is partially centered around completing 'missions' which usually involve destroying a certain enemy, or a number of certain enemies. It becomes a problem when the randomized enemy spawning doesn't give you enough of them, or doesn't give you enough weaker enemies to combo. It doesn't quite shoot the game down, but it's a slight blemish.It also strikes me that the aesthetic's slight harkening towards the stylings of Nazi Germany, not to mention the theme of Glorious Combatâ¢, might not sit well with everyone. It's nothing major, and the game usually looks starkly beautiful, so make your purchasing decision accordingly.At the very least, in short sessions it's a good timewaster. I especially recommend it to bullet hell fans who play nothing but Touhou and other games with anime girls who possess planet-destroying magical powers. You need some IRON in your diet.			"

												Its really REALLY good.You play as a completly insane German (maybe Austrian?) fighter pilot, who has the job of burining the skies in his ""Luft Rauser"", when you die you respawn at your battleship, where humourously characatured German generals, nurses and mad scientists brief you on your stats, missions and new abilities, something about it makes you feel that kind of ""Being bad is good"" feeling that you may have got from other games.The graphics and setting are steller, and really add to the insane atmosphere. The Music is superb and exhilarating, constantly pushing you forward. Think Hotline Miami music, but in the skies.The gameplay is where the game outshines every other aspect. There is no use of mouse here, just the keyboard for those of you who want to play this in you bed or on the train/bus or something.The movement and momentum that you get from flying is something which reminds me of the responsiveness of Super Meat Boy, it just ""feels"" right. It feels like you are moving an actual (very flexible) plane, where you are flinging it about using the momentum, only sometimes turining the engine on to move from place to place.There is use of a mission system which gives a little but more meaning behind the carnage, and completing these allows you to unlock new features for your plane, and each of these features does a good job of changing the feel, without causing you to relearn the game. Finally, do not worry about repitition, as it that there is quite alot of random generation, so it is always impossible to get used to where the enemy is coming from.I absolutly recommend this game, and at the current price point, i'd say go ahead and buy it at full price.

												Oh Luftrausers, how I love thee. Free flying arcade-style bullet hell game with lots of customizable aircraft parts to keep you trying different combinations until you hit that sweet spot. There's countless combinations that will effect your combat style and even the sound track. 8bit graphics, marching music with thumping bass to keep you inspired while you fight off hordes of baddies with your super-advanced machine. The game scales up in difficulty the better you do and presents many challenges for endless replay value. I've dumped about ten hours into this game, even though there is only one map, and still haven't come close to completing it. I consider this a ""must-have"" for the genre.			"

												It's really one of the few indie games that I think is overrated. The combat loses its luster after 10-15  minutes of playtime even with the varied weapons. Also, the system they have set up is not very intriguing or enticing toward investing more time than about 2-4 hours. You just keep going until the amount of guys on the screen is overwhleming and hope that when you die you've done some stuff you haven't before. That's it. That is literally the game. Overral I'd say 2/5, with the main appeal being the art-house WWI persepctive of a 2-d plane game. I got this for 6-7 $ and I'd say that along with Ultionus: A Poor Single Play DOS Game, it is one of the disappointments of the spring `14 indie releases and I wouldnt buy unless it's < 2$.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS or also know as ""LoveTrousers"" is a Sudo2d sidescroller (everything is actually rendered 3D made to look like 2d pixel art). In this game you fly a plane which I can only be assume to be consdier a Rauser. Durring your time in the game you will encounter many enimies and will be constantly outnumber and outguned. But there is no need to worry, thanks to nutty Sciencetist on your base ship your Rauser not only a litteral terror of the skies but also has the ablity to heal  yourslef when not fireing your main gun.          If you look up gameplay of this game what you see is pretty much all your getting. Flying over an ocen and shooting up your foes but you do have the option to unlock various things that will change up and give you incentive to keep playing.  The 1st thing that might intrest you is that you unlock parts of 3 interchangable catagories. Gun/Body/Engine. Each one of these catagories have a total of about 6 parts (I think) with the 6th of each catagory being an absolute grind of mental and pysical will to optain.    Each part is tied to its own Soundline for the game main soundtrack, which means each design you have will result in a slight variant of the theme which is pretty cool IMOAlso Each set of parts are given its own individual name (Which is around 6x6x6=216 names if you count up all the cobination)  The 2nd thing that might intrest you that the game has many color plannets presets which you unlock via the missions attach to each part (Makes the game look completly diffrent for better or worse).    Before I forget each part is tied to a mission of goal to achieve durring you run which leads to the general idea of more stuff and maybe a next mission if havn't completed a part's misson. The game will hold back on giving you more missions when you hit a roadblock which ussusally involves killing a certain enemy unit. The 3rd thing that might intrest you with this game is that the matches themselves are very quick (around 3-7 mins depending on mode and skill). Which makes it a perfect game to just play a match to put down before you need to go BUT there is an issue with this game being extremly addicting as you get into it. Be sure to watch the clock while you're playing because on more than 1 occasion I played for hours non-stop untill it was 5am in the morning or I began to develope an headacheIf there is an issue with this game, its the screen clutter when â¥â¥â¥â¥ really starts blowing up all around you. (The exact time you whound't want to lose sight of where you are in the mess of hell and fire). The game is also at unchangable 30fps which isn't a problem overall while playing but I'm not sure if the visuals would be smoother if it was set to something higher.Overall I think its a good game to grab around the $5 mark. A game meant for people who like difficult skill-base rouge-likes, intresting meachnics and a great soundtrack that changes with the game and how low your Rauser life goes. Although a little bare overall when it comes to actually playing wize, the progression is slow enough with your unlocks and skill to give you a good bit a fun for a decently long while. "

												I got this one in a Humble Bundle, so I'm gonna try to be objective.  TRY.  Here we go...    I get the whole ""retro"" thing, I really do...up to a reasonable point.  I thought both Lone Survivor and Hotline Miami were very smart, resourceful games in their own ways...games which took their pixel-y limitations and arguably turned them into not only positives, but true aesthetic ""decisions"".  But does anybody really want or ""need"" a 2D shoot-'em-up THIS primitive and THIS ugly in this day and age?  I was at least expecting some interesting (read: semi-realistic) physics, but you literally just go up and down and in and out of the water (did real planes ever actually do this?) and perpetually hold down the fire button, 'cause frankly there doesn't seem much point in ever letting go out of it.  In fact I swear - and this may just be deluded childhood memories - but I honestly could swear that ASTEROIDS had more compelling physics than this.  And am I wrong, but do we basically see all there is to see in the first few minutes of gameplay?      I'm honestly just bemused, more than anything.  But a quick glance at the overwhelmingly positive Steam reviews and a Metascore of EIGHTY - count 'em and weep, motherâ¥â¥â¥â¥in' EIGHTY ya'll - suggests that I just don't know my shooters from my â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥s and should probably just keep my unenlightened, fool mouth shut.  Maybe I just outgrew games this simplistic and primal when I was in my single digits, who knows...so in the interests of being open-minded, I'll just say...if it's a truly, defiantly ""old-school"" 2D shooter you're looking for, like the type you'd feed twenty cent coins into in the early 80s, then you may well find something to love here.  Me, I'm kinda glad video games have evolved past the stone age, even if the likes of Bioshock Infinite have arguably gone a little too far in the OPPOSITE direction.  Each to their own... Verdict: 4.5/10.			"

												Mindless fun.  It's not the sort of game I will rack up hundreds of hours playing, but for some mindless action fun, this is spot on.  It seems reminiscent of older games I grew up on like Raptor or 1942 but this is modern and the responsiveness of controls I wish I had in those older games.  The only con I've found so far is that when you're done playing, there's no quit game button so have to alt+tab out to close the game.  That aside, it's an easy game to learn, and easy to get into that one-more-level addictiveness.			"

												Vlambeer's modern take on arcade games like Asteroids and Time Pilot but with the added challenge of constantly fighting gravity and stalling out your plane. The game is full of bullet hell and the numerous opponents are quite good at shooting you down if you are flying in a predictable flight path. Sessions usually last between 30 second to 5 minutes if you can last that long. The acomplishment of going for bigger and better scores is what keeps me saying ""Just 5 more minutes"". In the early stages of challenge hunting you are rewarded with new parts that you can customize each rauser. And each combination of airplane parts has it's very own nickname. If you can manage to complete all challenges then you are rewarded a very special experimental aircraft. I have yet to accomplish this since it would seem the rogue-like part of very specific enemies appearing has kept me from finishing said challenges. My ownly gripes with the game are boats that double down when you can't tell them apart whilst they shoot double bullets at you. I disliked some glitches where I was not awarded the challenge (e.g. kill a blimp), because the blimp hadn't fully dropped from the above clouds; My biggest gripe being the problem that the enemies you are seeking to kill to win challenges will appear 1 out of 50 during applied challenge, but choose a different challenge and I seem to get them as often as 1 out of 20 for some reason. (specifically ""kill a -CLASSIFIED no. 1- (0/1))I would also add a personal plug that while i only put 20 hours on my steam account, I have this game for my PSVITA and I felt it was the best portable game to have around when you just want to zone out.

												Luftauser is a simply arcade game which re-elaborates the classic Asteroid mechanic of momentum based movement but cranks it up to 11. You fly your airplain on land, which means you will either fall due to gravity or you will use your engine to move where you want. Engines, body and guns can be chosen between a set for a high number of combinaitons of planes, each with his own name, look and soundtrack. The mechanic of the gameplay is all about balance: you can always fire your engine, but for tight manouvers you will need to turn it off and take it on again, which means that the timing of when you turn off your engine is as important as the time you use it. In this game you will take a lot of damage, but the the plane reparis automatically when you don't shoot your gun, so it is also important to chose when and when not to fire you gun.The style is minimalistic, but well executed nad the soundtrack is trance inducing, totally fit for the game. Enemy types are rather limited, so you will be fighting the same ones over and over, but their appearence is randomized, making every game play more of the same.After you unlocked all of the plane parts the only reason to keep you playing will be score improvement and goals, so if you are the kind of player who cares about scoreboard you may get tired of it soon.In conclusion Luftrauser is a simple arcade game, extremely well executed which is great in short burst of playing, but can only be considered a good purchase if you agree from the beginning to the premise that there is not really anything more than what you see. I wish there was more to it, but what is there...is Great!			"

												Tight controls, good hitboxes, awesome visual style & audio. Decent amount of customization to the plane possible through combination of weapon / hull / engine.Good variety of enemies.Minor technical issues like locking it to 30 fps don't take away from the experience, but why do this? While it feels smooth even on 30fps, it could be silky smooth running at 60.Anyway... it does have everything one can ask of a shmup really.

												Another fantastic arcade game from Vlambeer, and this time with enough customization to keep people interested even if they don't generally like the arcade-y style. Almost every ship combination can completely change how you play, and the music in the background also changes with what you choose, meaning that you can even personalize what your favorite ship+soundtrack combo is. The controls are absolutely fantastic, and make you look and feel like an expert pilot if you can use them right.I definitely recommend this one.			"

												Had some good hours in the library with this one when i should have been learning.Design a plane composed of a body, a weapon and an engine and just dive right into battle. There is no option for either part I whould miss and the combinations are numerous.The mechanics of turning faster while not boosting (and thus falling) are deep enough to keep you playing for some time even though the rounds can be pretty short (because of you dying so fast).The FOV needs some getting used to, though as enemies can be hit but also shoot at you while beeing outside the screen.Also, there are some weapons which do not pay off as good as others as the really high points can only be reached by chaining one giant combo. Some weapons are just not capable of that imo and thus rendered useless.Nonetheless, a nicely designed high score game but nothing more. No motivation besides that.			"

												This game is good, and I would recommend it, but: Caveat Emptor.This game isn't for everyone.The game is highly reminiscent of arcade titles, where you die easily and quickly, but is addictive and fun. The price tag is the biggest problem - how much do you value arcade games? I like this game enough I bought it twice (once on Steam, once on PS Vita), but I don't think everyone would. Look up ""Luftrauser"" (no S at the end) and play the original version. Watch some gameplay. If you like it, buy it. Maybe wait for a sale.It's another cool and refreshing Vlambeer game.Edit: This game has, in my opinion, less replay value than Nuclear Throne. Maybe go for that instead. I have over 25 hours in it, and only about 12 collectively (both ports) on this game.			"

												LuftRausers is basically a really focused arcade game. It doesn't do a lot, but what it does, it does really well. The game plays kind of like Asteroids except there is constant gravity pulling you towards the water. The customizable Rauser is pretty cool. You pick a weapon system such as a machinegun, a continuous laser, spread shot that pushes you back, homing missiles, etc), a body (high health but low agility, you take no ramming damage but have little health, drops bombs but slow health regen, etc) and an engine (heavy thrust but poor turning while thrusting, near anti-gravity, no damage entering the water, etc) and then you just fight nonstop waves of enemies trying to rack up as many points as possible. Each combination has its own nickname and each part has little achievements tied to it too.The gameplay is pretty frantic, as the sky quickly becomes filled with enemies and bullets. Thankfully you can take a decent amount of punishment before dying (unless you're using the melee part) and you regenerate health whenever you're not shooting.The variety you can get while building your Rauser is impressive, a few of the builds I liked was a Rauser equipped with a heavy, slow firing cannon, the melee body, and the water engine. I'd just dive bomb ships and fire the cannon just before I rammed the ship and plunged into the water, even the battleships can't take too many hits from that. Of course, if I timed it wrong I'd fly right into their gunfire and be blown apart (melee body can take 2 maybe 3 hits from full before dying). Another cool Rauser I had success with was the Beam Laser, Bomb Body, and ""Original"" balanced engine. I'd just zip around dodging enemies and bullets and slice ships and planes to ribbons.You don't have to grind too much for the parts either, I think I've basically unlocked almost all the parts (except one special one for each section I think, the padlock symbol looks different than the one for the rest I unlocked) in only about 2 hours of play I'd say. One additional neat thing is that the music changes depending on your parts selection. Its the same basic theme every time, but different parts use different ""instruments"". The music is pretty good too, IMO, though it might become repetitive quickly for some.Only managed to reach (what I assume) is the ""Boss"" A massive war zeppelin once. The game is quite difficult. I could see this being an actual arcade game from 15-20 years ago easily, though given how difficult it is, it better have had extra lives per credit. Either way it would've munched my quarters â¥â¥â¥â¥ing fast. This thing is fun.TL:DR Luftrausers Owns. Awesome Arcade style game, great gameplay, cool music, buy it.			"

												+Not using your thrusters is just as important as using it. You get significantly more turn control when your engine is stalled, allowing precision aiming and redirecting your movement in ways that defy realistic physics in favor of exciting gameplay.+The health system is interwoven into the weapons system. Pausing your onslaught lets you recover your health pool. The game plays alerts and puts an iris-in on the player when health is at dangerous levels.+Working together, there's an interesting and frantic dynamic of healing, attacking, moving, and steering that I've not seen any other game pull off.+Your planes, the 'Rausers', are customizable with the parts available. Mix and match for 126 different combinations that suit your style. Each of them even has their own name.+Soundtrack is dynamic. Each different Rauser part introduces a different melody, percussion, or bass-line to the song that is constructed for your session.+Camera is pretty solid at keeping itself oriented around what the player wants to be looking at based on where their Rauser is pointed and their current velocity.*Artstyle is minimalist, but minimalist is perfect for this type of game as it keeps visual noise on the down low so it can bombard your eyeballs with waves of bullets and enemy planes.-Scoring and combo system is heavily conflicting with the random enemy spawns. High-scores are incredibly dependent on a particularly rare enemy unit to spawn and then subsequently dispatched with a x20 multiplier.Overall, it's an incredibly well-tuned and fast-paced experience that is immensely satisfying to pick up and play for a few rounds, just don't go in expecting to be plugging hours away doing score attack as the numbers are ultimately meaningless beyond a certain point.

The missions have incredible variety and do take some strategy to conquer with regards to which parts you choose and, as if 'normal' mode wasn't hard enough, they've included a secret extra hard mode that you unlock after killing a blimp, which are ridiculously hard to destroy, I might add, though not impossible.The difficulty does get frustrating at times when you're completing objectives or trying to eclipse your highscore, but honestly, the sheer fun of feeling like an ace fighter pilot overshadows it.It is an extremely simple but incredibly fun game with tons of replayability, and of course there's the elation you feel when you get a new high score or complete the challenging objectives.

												Luftrausers is a 2D Arcade-Style Bullet Hell Shooter. You take control of a single fighter jet, holding off thousand of planes, jets, boats, and submarines until you die. It's essentially achieving the highest score you possibly can. This game isn't easy, it's hard, but mastering is where the game shines.This game is simple at it's core, but it's filled to the brim with fast paced, non-stop action, sure to get your adrenaline going. You don't fly this thing normally. You can turn it left, right, and accelerate by holding up. This means you can keep your fighter in the air for a good amount of time if you take advantage of the momentum. For enemies, you have your simple planes and boats, but stronger variants pop up, like battleships that have massive HP and fire a barrage of bullets, or aces in the sky with very accurate aim. You need to keep your wits about you, so dodge and shoot your way to victory. Shooting isn't the only way to kill enemies either, you can also ram into enemies for some massive damage, as the expense of losing health quickly. Your health is regenerative, so the way you recover it is to simply not fire your weapon.However, the best part about this game is the customization. There are literally 125 ways to build your fighter. You can change the weapon, body, and engine, each with their own perks and disadvantages. This makes the game accustomed to have so many different play styles, so you can see which one fits to your choosing. You can have a powerful tank with a cannon and heavy armor, have a super fast engine with a laser beam for quick aiming, or you can have a kamikaze style fighter with massive impact damage and explode spectacularly upon death.With all these parts, also come missions for each individual part. This gives the player the chance to try out new pieces and accomplish a goal while doing so. Think of it as a reward for trying new things, and testing your skils. It extends replay ability as well.After you've messed around in normal mode long enough, there's another mode called SFMT, which is essentially hard mode. Battleships, Aces, and more enemies spawn right at the beginning, and it's as frantic as you can imagine, and you WILL die quickly. If you've mastered normal mode, try your skills at SFMT, and see how long you can survive Hell.Overall, Luftrausers is an incredible arcade style game with blood pumping action that never stops with so much customization in one package. This game is definitely worth full price, and you'll have an awesome time if you enjoy a good challenge.			"

												Fun to play. Difficult to master. Extremely difficult to complete.Luftrausers is a retro-styled arcade shooter that controls well and keeps the upgrades unlocking at a nice pace. These upgrades are a good selection of weapons, flight styles and armour/mods. It's enjoyable trying them all out too see how they work and how they can adapt your play style and each of the 125 combinations has it's own unique aircraft name ... a really nice touch.Your enemies range from enemy aircraft with different weapons (I hate the enemy aces armed with lasers, you will too), ships, submarines and the main objective to completing the game ... the ""Blimp"".As I said before, the game is challenging and very difficult to complete, but it never seems to approach a rage inducing, keyboard smashing, joypad chucking level of difficulty. I think this is because of the game's ""One level only, quick, short games"" design.I liked it immensely. If you're a fan of side scrolling shoot-em-ups, you probably will too.8/10 Marked down from 9/10 for not having any multi-player capabilities. Hopefully they'll address that in a sequel.			"

For me, LUFTRAUSERS is a game that exemplifies the current 'indie craze' of being lauded for artistic style in place of actual content. In a way it's a sign of change (and in a good way at that) that these types of games are getting main stream recognition, but in another lifetime it feels like LUFTRAUSERS would have just been a flash game, and would have been free.LUFTRAUSERS gimmick is its sepia hued. Thatâs basically it. Though you can unlock different hues, I never played with them, they looked awful.Yes the world has moved on from flash portals and those kinds of games now have a new home called the App Store. So yes, itâs not outrageous in itself to be charging money for this style of game, but I do have issue with the amount. If I'd paid around Â£2, like many a game on the App Store, I'd have played it and walked away and felt like I got my money's worth, not saying I would have enjoyed it more, but I wouldn't have felt like I should have expected more. At Â£6.99 I feel like I should be getting more of a return for my investment.All the incentive to play is; score attack and fulfilling objectives like âkill x of yâ or âget a score of zâ, but that doesnât really change how youâre going to play the game, you were going to be doing those anyway. The score attack or the objectives (I was never really clear which) unlock equipment for your plane, and while the game may boast more than 125 combinations, there's little incentive from the game itself to mix it up, just your own desire to experiment. Also, the later upgrades suck for the most part, for example the 'homing' missiles need a lot of coaxing to avoid them just nose diving into the sea.And that's fundamentally my problem; the game isn't much fun. You play within a single area, that appears to loop, that's quite tall, though enemy boats at the bottom can shoot you at the top of it, so flying to the top is only a disadvantage to yourself. The controls are simple, (though menu navigation is a chore as the button that accesses a given menu changes depending on current screen) yet somehow it never feels like you have complete control, it's only possible to make fine changes to direction, or complete changes, it feels like there's no mid ground, which makes trying to manoeuvre a pain. There are a number of different enemies, but thereâs a gradual build up to the stronger enemies that the game follows, so in a game where you're expected to die a lot, you're going to see the same few over, and over, and over. Also, get used to that background music, you're going to be hearing that same small part of it every time too...The game is certainly functional, and I guess thatâs something to praise with the modern indie craze, a game being released in a non 'early access' form, but there's so little content provided and a generic shoot-'em-up experience at best.

												LUFTRAUSERS is a delightful mix of classic arcade shooter action and modern sensibilities, Atari style graphics with a high-res flourish and a World War II Nazi-chic aesthetic, all set to a thumping, crunchy, retro-neue military soundtrack. But above all, this game is challenging and fun. While the controls are simple, they take time to master, yet they're intuitive enough to feel natural. Each enemy has its own unique challenges to overcome, and choas reigns after a few minutes of sustained gameplay as the screen fills with planes, jets, ships and bullets, with a few boss enemies to overcome beside. Whats more, the game has near-endless replayability, as accumulating points and passing in-game missions rewards you with parts to customize your Rauser with for different gameplay styles. If you're a fan of shoot-'em-ups, I would highly recommended this game.			"

												BEST CONTROLS EVER This is a fun game that feels great, you can pull of insane moves and dodges, all with a very simple control system that feels just right and you just feel like a badass when you triple flip to kill an ace, shoot down a jet and pull up in time to see your thrusters reflect in the water. And pulling this off is quite easy but still feels satisfying every time, adding to this is the customization of the planes which all offer their unique playstyles and cool soundtracks. For fans of bullet hell cahos and tryhards there is the insane SFMT mode which starts everything at the highest difficulty, it even has an achievment to survive for the first 15 seconds or so and it is brutal. If you are just looking for a little fun or want to play a challenging bullet hell game then this is for you.			"

												With only two achievements left to get and about 3 hours in... I'm conflicted. The game is fun, handles great, and the hard mode is exactly that. The missions range from simple to ""You expect me to do what?!"", but I have a hard time recommending a game that has taken me nearly 3 hours to complete (It'll probably take 5 to finish all the missions). I was hoping for more after the airship. More ridiculous crafts to shoot out of the sky, a wider variety ships to kersplunk, and prehaps something other than the sky and the water. I had hopes that weren't realized, which happens in a lot of games I play, but this one hurt.  Everything about this game makes me want more, but there isn't any more. I've gone and experienced the whole thing in one sitting.So with all that personal hope aside, I do recommend this game if: You're fine with the understanding that there isn't a whole new world out there after you beat the first real challenging thing in the game.You want a game you can pick up for a little at a time and chip away at increasingly harder challenges (missions).You want a solid shooty experience that's refreshing, fast paced, and hilarious.You love flying tiny aircraft with huge guns!

It is simple to learn but hard to master. The controls are very simple which makes the game very deceiving thinking that you are in for a cake-walk, but ends up with a hail storm of bullets flying infront of your Rauser! Also on top of everything else you can customize your rauser with different engines,bodys and fireing mechanisms. I highly reconmend Luftrausers for any body who is looking for a fun time waster!

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fantastic game. The dogfighting is absolutely brilliant, due to the stalling mechanic, and feels amazing. Doing a quintuple flip before turning on your engines and hitting the water makes you feel like a bada--. The combat is also awesome; the health mechanic makes you stop shooting for five freaking seconds if you want to survive, and poses quite the challenge. It seems a tad overwhelming at first, but you get used to it. You can also unlock loads of parts to alter your game play, and the random mode can be fun as heck.All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is a good game. You should get it.			"

												Luftrausers is an incredibly fun game which instantly throws you into the air to sink or swim. It's simple enough to grasp with minimal controls and easy to latch onto goal; if it moves, blow it up. It's a shooter, it's an action game, it's fun, and it'll have you hooked. If this doesn't make you want to be a Rauser pilot, I don't know what will.Don't be fooled by the screenshots, this game is HARD. It appears easy, but it gets difficult fast. But unlike other games where ramped difficulty makes people want to give up after the first few tries, Luftrausers brings you back for more and more, giving you more options, more choices, more ways to kick some butt and blow stuff up. If you like a challenge, this game is definitely for you. You will spend hours with this.What makes this game so delightfully addictive is it's simple elegance. It doesn't need to be decked out and fancy to be a really fun and difficult game. It's satisfying to achieve goals and relaxing if you want to kick back and blow off steam. The action is non-stop, the music is great, and the graphics are an awesome throw back to the days of Space Invaders. You become a part of this incredible world full of bullets and fire, and you will love every second of it. It's worth every cent, and for $9.99, you'd be crazy to pass up a game like this.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. The controls are tight and gameplay is simple yet addicting. The only problem I can see with it is how short it is, seeing as how I got most things with an hour of playing. Despite this it still proves to be entertaining when I need a good pick me up. One thing I attribute to this would be the soundtrack. Fairly simple tunes yet oh so satisfying with each cockpit, body, and engine giving a new combination of music for over an amount of 125 different ship and song combinations. Like most other Vlambeer games I have played this is short but overall amazing and really fun and quirky. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of bullet hell games or games that have awesome soundtracks. If you like this game I would also recommend checking out Vlambeer's other games as they all offer something good. 10/10 I would love to play for the first time again.			"

This slick 8-bit style shooter can keep you entertained for a long time, whether you're trying to unlock every part and achievement or trying to up your highscore just that little bit more. The controls are smooth and precise and the stalling and gravity mechanic adds a new level of depth and control over your aircraft over other similar games. Plane customization, finding that perfect combo of weapon, body, and engine for your play style also adds to the depth and replayability. And the music! Different combinations of parts also change up the soundtrack, all variations on a common theme. Many a times I had to fight the urge to break into goosesteping while rocking out to its tunes. You'll get a lot of bang for your buck in Luftrausers and well worth any price itâs at, sale or not.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine LUFTRAUSERS is a game developed by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital and is a very enjoyable simple game that is really addictive! You are catapulted into the air and slowly gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to surviveDuring the course of the game you will unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can also collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different enginesFor each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, a blimp, or blowing up a submarine and so onIt's fun to complete these challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS at first and was reluctant to purchase it, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  "

												The game is fun if you can look past the FPS being locked at 30. Also, there is a sudden drop in FPS when you are under heavy fire. Some players say it's a way of giving you a ""second wind"". If it is in fact correct then it's a very bad implementation as it feels like the entire game froze. The game does have some replaybility owing to various challenges and the presence of two game modes. You can also have 125 different type of aircraft. Conclusion - Enjoyable shoot 'em up but wait for a sale before getting it. PS - It has the weirdest menu system I have ever seen.			"

												This game is absolutely fantastic. The controls are tight and gameplay is simple yet addicting. The only problem I can see with it is how short it is, seeing as how I got most things with an hour of playing. Despite this it still proves to be entertaining when I need a good pick me up. One thing I attribute to this would be the soundtrack. Fairly simple tunes yet oh so satisfying with each cockpit, body, and engine giving a new combination of music for over an amount of 125 different ship and song combinations. Like most other Vlambeer games I have played this is short but overall amazing and really fun and quirky. I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of bullet hell games or games that have awesome soundtracks. If you like this game I would also recommend checking out Vlambeer's other games as they all offer something good. 10/10 I would love to play for the first time again.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine LUFTRAUSERS is a game developed by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital and is a very enjoyable simple game that is really addictive! You are catapulted into the air and slowly gain momentum. You then need to control your momentum and at the same time kill enemies and try to surviveDuring the course of the game you will unlock new parts for your air plane, each offering a different special ability. You can also collect different weapons, different types of fuselage and different enginesFor each type of air plane the game asks for a number of challenges to complete, like sinking a battle ship, a blimp, or blowing up a submarine and so onIt's fun to complete these challenges and it's fun to experiment with the different plane types. I was very sceptic about LUFTRAUSERS at first and was reluctant to purchase it, but now that I've played it I fully recommend it. Despite its simplicity this game is a lot of fun to play in short bursts RECOMMENDED :)  "

Or do you just want to have some fun?If you answered yes to any one of those questions you'll probably love LUTRAUSERS.Paying tribute to an era of arcade shmups it's one of the best gameplay focused games to come out in recent memory.With hours worth of challenges, and loads of parts to unlock for your Luftrauser, it's well worth the $10.

												This is an extremely fun shoot 'em up that's as challenging as it is rewarding. There are next to no frills in terms of extra content, but the game is strong enough to stand on its own.The objective is obvious enough, so there's no time wasted on tutorials. You may take a few runs fumbling around trying to  steer your craft and dying annoying deaths, but when you get the hang of it the game feels almost perfect.Luftrausers really nailed it with the scoring system. As you kill enemies your combo increases, allowing you to stack phat multipliers to add to your score. The multiplier only lasts for a couple of seconds though, so there's always a rush to hunt and kill enemies to keep it going. Also, your health recovers by ceasing fire. You'll frequently run into tense situations where you halt your recovery in an attempt to keep your combo alive.The sense of progression is well done, too. As you get a better grip of the controls, you'll find yourself doing wacky maneuvers without even thinking about it. What was once a sloppy death from a couple bullets and crashing into a battleship turns into a delicate weaving throughout the barrage and skirting off the top of the boat. Clumsily trying to position yourself to get a shot at an Ace craft before it pulls off turns into charging at them head on with guns blazing and boosting through before they can even let loose their barrage. It all adds to up a thrilling sensation as you dance through storms of bullets and lay waste to all opposition.So yeah, highly recommended. Happy rausing.			"

												An excellent game !Pure arcade game. The controls are simple, and you should feel immediately taken by the frantic gameplay. Each play will last between 10s and a few minutes, depending on how good you are at dodging the endless streams of enemies bullets. But of course, you will want more, and in a few seconds you will be up in the air again trying to beat your previous score.You might think that this wouldn't be fun for hours if you're not into ""getting the highscore"" mentality. But Vlambeer (the studio who developped LUFTRAUSERS), manage to take that simple idea of an arcade dogfighting game, and add something more. Your plane has 3 parts (Gun, Body, Engine) which you will soon be able to modify. There are 5 different parts of each type, which allow for lots of variation. More importantly, most parts are ""side-grades"", which mean unlocked parts are not better, but different than the original parts. Each part requires you to adapt your gameplay, and will offer different strengths and weaknesses.To encourage you to try all the parts, each part is linked to several ""missions"", which are challenges you can accomplish with that part. For example ""Killing 5 different enemies types in a single game"", ""Getting 5000 points in a single game"", ""Kill 150 enemies accross all playthrough"", etc... Theses are not mandatory, but will allow you to unlock other parts and a few other hidden stuff. While trying to perform theses challenges, you will get to understand the different parts better, and find that some suits you better than others. I've often dismissed a specific part as weak, until i tried to complete its missions and figured out how to best use it (which part should go with which, and how to adapt my gameplay to the new plane). My 3 best scores have been with 3 different planes. Also it's very telling that in forum threads asking ""what's the best plane for doing X ?"" all theses answers will vary wildly. There is no ""best"" plane. It's all about personal tastes and how you use each plane. So congratulations to Vlambeer for managing to balance all theses parts together.All of that means that, over the simple arcade gameplay, there is that metagame to try to finish all missions. It may or may not please everybody, but i know it keeps me playing way more than a basic ""aim for the highscore"" game would.It's quite easy to unlock all parts, so no player should frustrated that they lack part, but for hardcore players, unlocking everything is gonna be a true challenge. Achievements stats show that less than 1% of players have managed to finish all missions.			"

												Vlambeer did an amazing job here, Luftrausers is probably one of the most fun pick-up-and-play-for-five-minutes games there is. If you want to quickly have a bit of fun and feel amazing zipping about shooting things, Luftrausers will supply that in spades. It's got tight controls, a simple concept, and the build your own plane mechanic adds a lot to what otherwise would be an admittedly light offering. I have to admit, having been given it as a gift, the price is pretty high for the amount of content, which is one thing I would knock it for. However, I liked it enough that I waited for a sale, and bought it right back for the person who originally gave it to me; it's such a satisfying experience it needs to be shared. Something else to note is the excellent soundtrack, which is good to listen to on it's own, and adds much of the hectic atmosphere. My advice, wait for a sale, buy this for maybe 50% off, then spend that money buying the soundtrack and enjoy both.			"

The controls are not accurate enough to make it a fun ""bullet-dodge"" game, instead the controls make you feel engaged in duels - but it's not much about that, game is mostly about finding a cheese-tactic in order to scratch another mission off your list.Every combination of gun/ship/boost make you feel crippled with drawbacks - you never feel like you are particularly strong or efficient, you just feel like a slug trying to all-in for a mission clear; die, repeat.Drawbacks on all gear should be adjusted - it makes no sense that EVERYTHING has so strong drawbacks that you ALWAYS feel like a â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ retard. Want spread-fire? Ok cool, but you can barely shoot upward now because the kickback is so strong that you lose all elevation. Want laser? Sure, but now your aim sucks so you can barely make turns. Want to be able to handle collision? Sure, but now you die from 3 bullets instead. Makes the game feel like a frustrating chose unfortunately.			"

												A really cool little arcade style side-on aerial shooter. Bit like the original Geometry Wars in that the game rarely lasts more than a minute or two.

												LUFTRAUSERS is an over-the-top arcade dog-fighting game by Vlambeer. If you've played any other of their games, you know what you can expect: arcade games at their core, but with a much more modern design.Your objective is to survive as long as possible, trying to keep your combo up, and unlock plane parts by completing missions. It's you against an army, and it's pretty damn chaotic! Context I've had this game for a few months, and yet, when I first tried it, the controls didn't seem all that good, and I put it on hold... Until recently. I decided to play it for a bit more, to get used to the controls and I was very impressed! This is one of the best games of this genre I've played.It's quite similar to Super Meat Boy, in the sense that the real joy of playing it is in the subtlety of the controls. Mastering it feels very satisfying! Every ship part interacts with your overall movement, making the planes feel great to control.PresentationThe graphic style reminds my of Papers, Please!, although that may be because of the main color-scheme, as well as the soviet-esque aesthetic. It's pretty simple, but I don't really have any problems with it. Everything seems carefuly designed, especially when you take into account how few colors are used!You can always distinguish enemies and bullets clearly, with one intentional exception: clouds. Even in them, you can still see what you need, but it's... well, clouded, I guess.One really awesome addition is that you can unlock different color-schemes. Most of them aren't actually practical, giving the game a crazy psychedelic feel, but I can see some being more clear to some people. It's mostly there to keep things varied. And it's just cool to be able to change the whole look of the game for a few runs. It's something I'd like some games to have more often!The music is also pretty interesting! Everything is composed of 3 tracks: percussion, bass, and lead. Your ship also has 3 parts. You can see where this is going: The music is determined by your ship's composition! All of the tracks are in the same key and rhythm, composed so that they could be switched at will. So, every time you start a run with a different ship, the music will also be different!It's low res and old-school, but if fits the rest of the game. I really enjoyed it!StructureSo, there are 2 modes: normal, and SFMT. The latter is basically hardcore mode, and you'll often die within 5 seconds. That mode is utterly unfair, and it's there to see which players can persevere through hardship long enough to unlock the  uber plane. More on it later on.You'll start with only 1 of each part, but you'll be able to unlock up to 5 per type, by completing the missions. Each part has very different strengths and weaknesses, and will certainly change how you maneuvre your ship.There is only one missions per part, in SFMT, but they're far harder than their normal counterparts (well, mostly one, but still...). There are also missions for the Random part. As the name indicates, a part of the type is chosen when you launch. There's only one ""map"", if you will. There's water at the bottom, and dangerous clouds on the top, but of which will hurt you. Enemies spawn in waves, of several types. More and bigger enemies will spawn depending on the enemies you've previously kill, making the progression very dynamic. While there's still a great deal of randomness, you can kill the enemies most convenient for your objective (spawning a special enemy, getting higher score, surviving longer, etc.)Some of the missions are based on spawning a Blimp, or an Unclassified ship. Part of the fun is in figuring out when these spawn and out to do it more or less consistently. The forums are also fairly active, with people figuring it out in a group, instead of just checking a guide.You can play the game for the highscores (with leaderboards!) or to complete every mission. The missions are very nice to make you learn the game! First off, you'll have to use different combinations! And second, the missions are also more of less designed for the part's strengths and weaknesses. They're there to help you realize how to play them in a certain way, taking full advantage of it.The game is also hard as nails, so you'll keep going back to it to reach higher and higher, so you might as well try everything!Control and MechanicsThis is undoubtedly, the most important part of LUFTRAUSERS, how the ship controls.Basically, you use Left/Right to rotate, and then the Boost to propel yourself in the given direction. I'm sure there's a significant number of games that use this scheme, but I was used to traditional twin-stick shooters, so it definitely felt weird, at first. Once you get the hang of it, though, it's amazing!This is not all, though. Every weapon also has a recoil associated with it, so you'll also be sent back, by some weapons. The propellers are stronger than weapons, of course, but it's the interaction between the two that's so satisfying.Also from that, each part is really different from one another. For example, there's one that gives you a very strong boost, but your turning speed while boosting is very low; One makes you immune to water, but clouds hurt you more; One shoots bullets to propel you, but is weaker than most, while damaging enemies behind you... I won't spoil more of these.The weapons range from a laser, to a spread gun, to a cannon with a very slow recharge... etc.The body mostly controls your HP, and resilience to damage. There are a few differences, though. For example, one drops periodical bombs, while another has a nuke on death. There's one that makes you immune to collision against other planes, but has much less HP. etc.One important aspect! Your ships regenerates health. However, that only happens while you can shoot, but are not! This means, if your weapon is reloading, you will not heal. If it's ready, though, and you're not shooting, you'll heal. Bullets are very damaging, so you have to very carefuly balance when you're shooting, and when you're not.BottomlineEven the description of the game is taking too many words...! The point is: the attention to detail is absolutely incredible. Everything seems to be part of a major clockwork design. Everything works together beautifuly and is really a blast to play!If you like score-attack games, and are willing to stick with the controls for the initial habituation, I'm sure you'll not be disappointed!Now, onto the interesting aspects at play.The game encourages you to try different combinations and learn how to master itAs I've mentioned, the missions are a major focus on this game, with the intent of teaching you. It's a commonly used tactic, nowadays, but it works, here! It's a great way of keeping things varied, never feeling stale. Besides, it keeps you engaged.Missions pull you inIn a sense, it keeps you always expecting something else. Many times I find myself stopping to play a game, because I'm not sure it still has something to show me. In here, you're always teased with these missions, and even the achievement. There's something big to look forward to, and it keeps you coming back! One more try!Yep, it's that kind of game! As soon as you die, you'll want to jump right back it! Each run shouldn't take you much longer than 5 minutes, if you're lucky. It's hectic and stressful, but in the best of ways. It's challenging and, at times, almost frustrating, but you know that it's always your fault when you die (not on SFMT, that's a freaking nightmare, it's unbalanced, but there's a purpose to it...).I would be repeating myself, at this point. Definitely give it a go, it's f'n awesome!			"

You can choose a piece from each 3 sets of items to put together your plane. Each 1 out of 125 combinations comes with its own name such as the Swordfish or the Samurauser, even the Teddy!

												In short: this game isn't any '10-minute time killer' - it creates a sense of dedication in the player to improve. Worth every cent.In LUFTRAUSERS, skill matters just as much as style. You are rewarded for playing well to the aircraft's strengths with large combos and/or survivability, but the game is not reluctant in the least to punish careless mistakes and exploit the plane's weaknesses from both above and below. The player is given plentiful options to craft their most favorable flight/combat experience, yet they must always be prepared to suffer the cons of their choices; frankly, the balances between Pro and Con in this game are commendable and always clearly stated.The combat itself starts out quite simple with a few basic enemies to work with that are vulnerable to virtually any style. This acts as a sort of grace period for pilots testing new combinations. However, the game quickly works itself into a pilot's nightmare full of stray bullets, introducing new enemies in both sea and air. This steep difficulty curve, in combination with the mission system and various 'bosses', contributes greatly to the addictiveness of the game. New high scores give you a genuine sense of accomplishment and encourage the pilot to pursue other combinations that may help them reach even higher. All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is one tough survival test that will keep you coming back for more.			"

												Well, after playing this for a while, I can easily sum this up in a couple of bullet points so here we go.What I like:- Stalling in midair and do ridiculous maneuvers to shoot at enemies and avoid enemy fire- customization of plane parts ranging from using different types of guns, bodies, and engines with certain benefits and tradeoffs- mixing plane parts not only change the name of the plane, but also the music while you are playing- enemy variety out on the open sea- high replayability, especially when you randomize plane parts after each session just to see what you getWhat I didn't care about:- the unlockable color palette, mainly because some of them didn't look that great or just literaly hurt my eyes in general so basically I ended up sticking with the default color paletteWhat I dislike:- other than the unlockable color palette, I have no complaints about this gameMy overall impressions in a nutshell, stop reading reviews and buy this game ASAP!!!

												You aren't plunged into a deep storyline with deep story progression. You aren't managing skill trees. There isn't some big economy to buy, sell, and trade with other players.You just go in, take to the skies, and fly until you die.It's simplicity makes it an awesome game to pick up and play anytime youfeel like it, for as long as you want. Games like Undertale are great, but if I haven't played in a while, I'll need to recap everything I did, have, and need.This game does do well on the battle. Not only is there a variety of unlockable weapons that have their advantages an disadvantages, but you will mainly focus on how you move more. Sometimes, it's more viable to crash into your enemies rather than try and aim and shoot at them. It is really fun.I should note here that this game works best with a controller. I haven't played with a keyboard, but I can't imagine it going that well. The joystick controlls work best with the fluid movement of this game.			"

												Another fun and addictive little game made by Vlambeer. Your goal in Luftrausers is to destroy as many planes, ships, submarines, even zeppelines and ofcourse try to dodge incoming bullets and fight gravity! After you've beaten some of the objectives (like destroy 3 battleships..) you may earn different armor, engines and weapons. There are many different combinations and by trying them out you might figure out which is best suited for you.Even though the game's graphics may look a bit 'simple' it does the job perfectly, also there's a great soundtrack and there are online leaderboards for you to test your skills vs other players.Luftrausers is recommended to most arcade fans.

												Caveat: I got this on sale for 75% off.A friend recommended this to me, or rather, I saw it on their wish list and gave it a look.  I bought it immediately - it's a relatively simple concept, a sort of free-roaming shooter as opposed to V/H scrolling, where you can unlock new parts and combine them before flying out to cause destruction.But the execution here - it's such a tight little package of awesome from start to (I can't say finish exactly) where I am now.  The sepia-tone graphics that actually make sense, the simple yet stylized look, the incredibly fluid way everything moves, and the perfectly fitting soundtrack all come together to make a game that's far more than the sum of its parts.I got this for a friend who streams games just so he could show it off, because I think a precious little gem like this deserves more attention than it likely gets.  Shooters don't have to be visually stunning or flashy (IMO), they just need to play well and be cohesive.  And this, haha, is right on target.			"

												You aren't plunged into a deep storyline with deep story progression. You aren't managing skill trees. There isn't some big economy to buy, sell, and trade with other players.You just go in, take to the skies, and fly until you die.It's simplicity makes it an awesome game to pick up and play anytime youfeel like it, for as long as you want. Games like Undertale are great, but if I haven't played in a while, I'll need to recap everything I did, have, and need.This game does do well on the battle. Not only is there a variety of unlockable weapons that have their advantages an disadvantages, but you will mainly focus on how you move more. Sometimes, it's more viable to crash into your enemies rather than try and aim and shoot at them. It is really fun.I should note here that this game works best with a controller. I haven't played with a keyboard, but I can't imagine it going that well. The joystick controlls work best with the fluid movement of this game.			"

												Short, simple, and fun. Nothing else to this game.This is an amazingly fun game that you can play on just about anything. It's simple controls and repetitive gameplay is extremely amusing. Even if it takes a different point of view from (assuming) WW2, the game's design along with the OST offers a really fun experience.Even though I just started, I see myself playing more of it.Pick it up on sale! Worth every cent.			"

												Luftrausers is an arcade dogfighter game in which you shoot boats, jets, aircrafts and whatnots. A gamesession can variate between 30 seconds to 5 minutes (IF you got any luck surviving this long^^). ItÂ´s brutal, unforgiving, plain and simple but a hellish addicting game =)GAMEPLAYSimply put, you have to press 4 different buttons. And avoiding projectiles while flying. Oh and sometimes you neednÂ´t to push a button or else you fly directly into another projectile xD But this depens on how you build up your aircraft. Bulky but slow with high firepower or fast with a melee body ala Kamikaze Joe? There are three different slots where you can choose your loadout: Weapon, Body and Engine. To discribe the gameplay of Luftrausers is a little hard so I put a playlist at the end of this review.GRAPHICSGraphics on the other hand are quite simple to discribe. 8-bit pixels with a stabile framerate of 30 FPS deliver fluid pictures of hate and enjoyment. Through unlockable color patterns the original 3-Color mode can be switched from psychodellic neon to simple black and grey and white. Every mode except the original made me puke and laugh at the same time but this lies in the eye of the beholder. :PSOUNDNow this is what really stands out. Every game has a soundtrack but Luftrausers is a shiny example for how great and important good music is for a game. Every bodypart has its own ""OST"". IÂ´d say industrial meets 8-Bit... I totally love it =)For 9â¬ itÂ´s hard not to recommend this game but after playing it for 8 hours only highscore hunting is left (maybe achievement hunting, but thatÂ´s not for me) I hope thereÂ´ll be updates with more equipment parts to play around with or maybe new enemies. For those who beat the normal mode AND defeated an enormous aircraft called ""BLIMP"" you get access to a new mode called ""SFMT"".. Even satan cries in his bedchamber after he played ten minutes in this mode xDhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5l53rMB022oUMaN98kNHfuafv6XRGEu "

												It's utterly insane and I'm terrible at it - but it's good old fashioned fun. Some caveats you may not pick up on from watching videos - The menus are â¥â¥â¥â¥in awful, especially if you want to configure a controller. Also the color scheme can wear on the eyes after a few minutes for me. Honestly though, if you watch a video of the gameplay and it looks like reckless nutty fun to you - it is probably worth the buy.Oh and obviously don't come here looking for a complex narrative or anything like that, this is a straight to the point old school arcade shooter.

												This is just purely an extensive arcade 2D shoot 'em up.The main goal of the game is to survive long as possible and and try to score  maximum possible points.The longer you are in the game, the more enemies coming at you.And try at all times to keep your combo at 20x for a long time to get a crazy high score.That is most the arcade part of the game is you ask me.Beside that you have the option to customize your plane with a few upgrade you unlock along the way.Every parts gives you some new mission to play ... and give you a new goal and will keep you playing.Some mission are very hard to get if you ask me.I find this game super challenge and very addictive to a certain point of the game.Overall I think it's a great game and will give you some playing time.Replay value is good and this can be better if you ask me.I give it a 7/10 score.

												Luftrausers is a frenetic aerial combat bullet hell 2D retro dogfight shooter or whatever you want to call it.Basically you have a simple 4 button control scheme of turn left/right, boost forward, and shoot. As you play you unlock more ship parts to customize with. Mix and match parts in sets of 3 with guns, hulls, and engines. Each part has a few achievements that you unlock in succession when you use those parts. Also they affect the soundtrack variation in a way I have yet to figure out. Take to the skies and set ablaze all who dare stand in your path using your ultimate aircraft and you divebomb into boats to explode them.			"

												Every once in a while you come across a game that transcends gauging its worth based on style or substance, and is instead just pure, visceral joy to play. Luftrausers joins that small party of games that is just so incredibly fun to simply experience that most traditional negatives it might have really do become inconsequential. I canât really say anything that a thousand reviews before me havenât already as itâs been near impossible to look on a game related site and not see people singing this games praises. But thatâs certainly not without reason. For the sake of argument letâs say this really is the first review youâve run across (I pity you, go read someone elseâs review, seriously :P); what is Luftrausers?Short Version: A physics driven, bullet-hell, score attack, manic shooter with retro throwbacks but its own style. Go buy it.Long Version: Luftrausers is an aerial combat shooter performed in the old-school style of arcade classics but with its own spin. That spin is basing its movement around climbing and diving physics, propelling high into the air only to release the throttle and let gravity carry you back down. Repeating the process over and over, enabling you to deftly navigate a maze of bullets being fired from dozens of on screen enemies at a time in a way thatâs far more fulfilling than a traditional shmup. Orient this around an amusing stylized art-style and a score attack set-up. The goal is to live as long as possible and kill as much as you can in the process. To add depth and longevity you unlock new weapons, armor, and engines that can be combined in dozens of different set-ups to change how you move and fight. Each part also has its own set of missions (such as reaching max combo, killing a certain type of enemy, or a certain number, etc.) that you complete to unlock further parts. Toying around with these various combinations adds some serious depth to an otherwise simple process, and injects a good deal of life into the already highly entertaining physics/gameplay.Does it have some negatives? Nothing major that should detract from the experience for most people. For the sake of fairness Iâll pick apart two things that come to mind, but they really are minor when compared to the games overall quality. First the game could have benefited from a story mode. While clearly not necessary the style and humor the game does have on hand was a very solid framework for launching some kooky little tale off of. In the end the game still has a lot of life to it but a story mode would have extended that even further. The second and a REALLY small tick is that some of the missions to unlock new parts are infuriatingly luck based. Like killing a submarine at max combo when in all the thousands of enemies Iâve killed Iâve seen exactly seven submarines making a few missions like this frustrating. But both complaints are virtual non-factors in the face of just how good everything else is, but perhaps worth mentioning just to give you the full scoop.In short Luftrausers is pretty much the perfect score attack game, and if you like the genre you definitely need it in your library as soon as you can pick it up.

												Arcade gaming. Each life lasts up to 2 minutes on your first go, but you can survive for as long as you are able to.The music is way more interesting than I gave it credit for. The number of unlocks keeps it fresh, if only to hear how each piece of gear changed the music! The gear-specific achievement challenges are suitably challenging and push you to try out new combos. I'm sure there are OPTIMAL loadouts, but I haven't felt like there are any except for specific goals you set out to do.Really entertaining. Short sessions turn into 30+ minutes burnt up. I doubt I'll go back to it that often after I finish, but it's been fun nonetheless.As an aside, it reminds me of a game called Continuum (Subspace), with a variant from SOEgames called Cosmic Rift. Infantry Online is vaguely similar, but anyway, Subspace was a 2D overhead space shooter. A bit of nostalgia to that game, especially with its risk-reward mechanic of your HP meter being both ammo and health.That dynamic of risk-reward created a lot of moments of tension, thinking in split seconds whether or not to fire off a couple shots to cancel the regen to keep the combo alive while juggling your plane through streams of bullets.Also shoutouts to Kozilek for doing the music and putting a ship named after himself in the game, too.

												Recommended: If you at all liked classic arcade side-scrolling shooters of old, LUFTRAUSERS is right up your alley.  It's a well-made side-scroller with high production values and excellent execution.LUFTRAUSERS is a classic side-scrolling arcade shooter made by Vlambeer and published by Devolver Digital.  Vlambeer is a game development house that has a certain knack for having their game ideas ripped off by mobile developers, and there's very much a reason for that: they make simple, arcade retro games very, very well, with an imitable art style and direction.At it's heart, LUFTRAUSERS is a side-scrolling shooter set in a sort of alternate reality at the birth of jet flight, full of all kinds of anachronistic references to old science fiction and a rich graphics style that fully realises and embellishes the genre.  The art style in general is very well-implemented, as is the sound design.  It all fits together very well.  The music design deserves special mention, because the in-game music changes slightly depending upon your choice of hull, weapon, and engine.  So very different choices of plane will result in very different in-game music and it is a way of adding variety to the game that hasn't been much used before.The game mechanics are simple, but work very well.  The divergence from simple normal side-scrolling is the inclusion of a stall mechanic - when you are engaging the engine boost, you simply glide, which allows greater precision in turns at the price of losing altitude and slower forward momentum.  It allows for a high skill ceiling in the maneuvering and some truly amazing stunts.  Coupled with a variety of weapons, hulls, and engines that all act differently, the game not only offers a variety that keeps the game fresh, but also allows a player plenty of latitude to find a combination that fits their play-style.  The controls are responsive, and it plays just fine with a keyboard, though this is another game that definitely feels more authentic with a classic controller.The enemies in the game are varied and become incrementally more difficult as you survive longer.  It starts as simple fighter planes, but progresses to patrol boats, jet fighters, ace pilots, battleships, and more.  On top of that, unlock enough and you can unlock a ""SFMT Mode"" that not only greatly increases the speed at which the enemy progression occurs, but also unlocks new enemies to fight, as well as affords new unlocks for yourself.All in all while the game mechanics themselves are fairly simplistic, there is plenty of variety to keep you engaged and the production values for this kind of game are as high as one might have come to expect from Vlambeer.  if you like side-scrolling shooters, then I think you'll find a lot to love in LUFTRAUSERS.Published: http://highlandarrow.com/index.php/reviews/86-review-luftrausers "

												It's a good time killer that you may play for an hour or two. Flying around and instantly changing directions and blowing up planes and boats is incredibly fun....

Fly in dozens of different real life planes, painstakingly rendered in lush 3D using hundreds of references taken from the Smithsonian's air museum.For added realism, use a wireless keyboard with low batteries. You'll never know when the keyboard stops responding, representing an engine stall that American pilots often faced in the heat of battle due to the low quality of their engine parts.			"

												Fun for the first 30 minutes or so before it all goes downhill, mainly because there's not much left to do and SFMT is very largely luck-based. Fairly disappointing.After the first maybe 15-20 minutes you may encounter your first blimp, kind of a boss which was fantastic the first time but it turns out that's basically the most powerful thing, the only boss ever. A hardcore SFMT mode just adds more stuff and more bullets coming at you, no new interesting enemies.Also no restart button I could find when I accidentally started a game in the wrong mode or wrong ship setup, you have to just kill yourself which is rather difficult to do in the normal game mode for 10-15 seconds while there are very few enemies (particularly with the underwater thruster).""Let's have a 5sec air raid siren start each hardcore game, where average playtime is about 5sec."" That's where I had to mute my audio unfortunately where it was otherwise enjoyable in other parts of the game.Again the first 30 minutes of playing and unlocking (~80% of the game) stuff is great fun, which is maybe why this game got so many great reviews from critics who didn't play further? Personally I don't think it was worth the $5 I paid during a steam sale. "

												This game is lie no other....replayability is extremely high, not only because of the unlockables and challenges but also because of the super tight controls. While the controls may seem unusual at first, you pick up on them right away. The art style is pleasent and goes very well with the overall theme. The color palette used for this game is easy on the eyes and will keep you sucked in for a while. The only minor downside is the usic. The music might seem enjoyble at first but it can get tiresome if you play for too long. Reason why i say that is minor is because the explosion sounds pretty much muffles out the music after you get deep in the levels. Definitly a must buy, but i felt like explaining everything to you guys first.			"

												BEWARE. This game does not allow you to change the volume settings or any options until after you beat the tutorial stage. This is important enough to be the first line of this review because if you're like me and like to chat with friends over voicechat, you may need your master volume turned up pretty high and adjust games as needed. I almost didn't even play this game because of how loud it was on startup and there was nothing I could do in-game to fix it. Eventually after some googling I took some time away from friends to mute everything so I could pass the tutorial and actual fix the in game volume.Now, after that this is an extremely fun game. The arcade action is quick and fun and there's a ton of different configurations of parts to make your Rauser out of. Well, if a ton is equal to One Hundred and Twenty Five. Still, there's a lot of variety and each part has it's own mission objectives, giving some direction other than just scoring and adding to longevity to the experience. The four color aesthetic works wonderfully and the music plays to the action very well. Besides the red and sepia look there are other color schemes to unlock, most of which I've found are completely terrible, but they are completely optional and don't take away from the core experience which is so fun that the only real complaint I have with it is that I wish there was more!

												After about an hour of playtime, you will have seen enough to know what to expect from this game. That is not a bad thing in this instance because Luftrausers  is a great arcade experience that relies heavily on gameplay and control. Not much of a campaign or story to speak of, but the dogfighting feels sublime. Turning your customizeable aircraft in mid air after cutting the thrusters gives you a cool sense of gravity that reminds me of an old school game but with modern tight control. The devs haven't crammed a jillion gameplay elements into this hoping to add ""variety"" either. The core gameplay stands on it's own and let's you get right into the fray without a lot of BS. And when you die, and you will, you'll be right back out there fighting it out within seconds if you wish. This is what I want from indie games. A game that doesn't try to pad out the experience to feel like a big title, instead Luftrausers does one thing uniquely and extremely well and with a lot of style.			"

												Should have made an option to play as a boat because at least half of the time you only end up fighting boats. The rate at which enemies appear is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes the screen is filled with enemy planes and you can get wicked high combos easily, sometimes you just fly around the boats and it takes much longer and is much less thrilling.

												Luftrausers is an entertaining if short lived arcade dogfighting game. The core concepts presented in Luftrausers are a strong backbone for what I would hope the next entry would hopefully embellish. I say this becuase Luftrausers has a delightfully simple control scheme, neat retro visuals, hints at a curious larger universe, and has many fun enemies to combat. However, Luftrausers is lacking in some areas. Namely that the store page bills this game as having over 100 missions, but these are not quests or levels or specific scenarios which change base gameplay in any real way. The missions they refer to are more like challenges. The ""story"" is extremely limited.  Luftrausers only has a survival/score attack gamemode which doubles as the campaign for the couple hours it takes to play through. While playing through the first ""missions"" and ""story"" things were hugely entertaining to discover and every new unlock, every new enemy fought, and every slideshow of ""story"" was good. But, this is a game which does not have a lot of content past about 3 hours of gameplay. After that, you'll pretty much have seen everything and just be trying out plane combos you didn't try yet, or trying to beat your own highscore.Now I DO recommend Luftrausers, but it is a game I wouldn't recommend too highly because I feel it lacks some features I feel would really round out the package and make it basically perfect. First, as you may have guessed, I am bothered by the lack of a story for the single player. The story isn't a large concern of mine, but an expanded universe would be welcome. Second, the score attack/survival mode in this game is basically perfect except for stopping when the boss is destroyed, but I think Luftrausers could actually benefit from different modes, maybe an objective based mode with specific targets, twists on normal gameplay, and possibly even special plane powers not typically used. Third is leaderboards. This game tracks your score locally for each plane, but you have no comparison to anything but your best run. For competetive people, this may not be enough. I think online leaderboards or even traditional arcade local leaderboards with initials are A MUST! Fourth, local multiplayer with friends with frickin' jets with frickin' missles man. Make it happen in a sequel please! Competetive or cooperative, this is a game I really would love to share with people when they come over!All said and done though, Luftrausers is still a unique game which is undeniably fun for a few hours. Playing as a super fast jet with a nuke inside the body and firing homing missles at crowds of smaller enemy planes to the harmonious and legendary Welcome To The Dangerzone by Kenny Loggins is a memory I will cherish forever, and I have Luftrausers to thank for that. I can also thank Luftrausers for allowing me to finally pilot a Bond movie type vehicle which functions as a jet, a battering ram, and a submarine all at once, sinking destroyers by dropping into the ocean, and surfacing like a majestic humpback whale by crashing straight through the prow of the destroyer and thereby blowing it up. 7/10 overall.

												Fast indie action arcade game, bullets flying here and there. And there, too. Did I mention this game has a lot of bullets? They even have bullets that come out of the butt of your plane! Kinda hinting at the possibility of customizing your plane with different parts. This game sure is worth a shot, more like few thousand shots.Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

												The good: DirectInput gamepads are supported. Pixel art with some nice details. Some variety in ships and guns you can use.The bad: Menu needs some serious improvement - no way to exit the game while in-game, I have to use Alt+F4. Controls reconfiguration works so-so - I accidently assigned 2 actions to 1 button, and ended up breaking my controls with no way to revert back. Had to dig in the files of a game to reset all the controls. (Again, no option for it in the menu.) (I wrote a guide that covers it if you have the same problem.) IMO you won't play this game often and in long runs. It will get repetitive fairly fast. Quick, fast paced and arcade experience that not everyone will like (I did).Overall I liked this game, difficult to recommend it for the full price but I think it's worth a try.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is an arcade type shooter in a very minimalist form but with sharp gameplay and addictive design that makes it extremely fun and gives it longevity. It's a game that uses very simplistic elements but makes the most out of them from just having a single ""level"" and track of BGM that are used in a way that adds to the exhilarating gameplay making each gameplay session escalate as you go on and offer further challenge. The longevity is provided by an unlockable-based system that rewards you as you complete different challenges which gives you a reason to alter your playstyle and rethink your approach.Definitely recommended.

The war has gotten desperate the only choice is to send out experimental craft as soon as they are conceived in the mad mind of our scientist brothers.Luftrausers is an arcade style 2D side scrolling shooter where you pilot crafts build from a collection of parts.  What makes this game great is not only the variety of crafts but how every combination is still great to control and play.With the blood pumping soundtrack and stylized pixel art this game is a buffet of enjoyment at your gaming table.

												There isn't a lot to say here. Luftrausers is a pretty straight forward arcade style bullet hell game that is well designed and fun to play. It offers ways to customize your ""rausers"" with different bodies, weapons, and engines. I do like that each combination has its own name, it's not a big deal, but it's a small thing that I rather like. According to the trailer each rauser has its own music and while I did notice a slight, it's not so unique that I instantly noticed.Luftrausers takes up very little space on my hard drive, it isn't taxing on my processor, it's cheap, and you can jump into a game in seconds. It's a game I play when I have a few minutes to kill like BroForce or Papers Please, but I think BroForce has more content. Still, Luftrausers is a lot of fun and I strongly recommend like pretty much the majority of people who play it.			"

												BEWARE. This game does not allow you to change the volume settings or any options until after you beat the tutorial stage. This is important enough to be the first line of this review because if you're like me and like to chat with friends over voicechat, you may need your master volume turned up pretty high and adjust games as needed. I almost didn't even play this game because of how loud it was on startup and there was nothing I could do in-game to fix it. Eventually after some googling I took some time away from friends to mute everything so I could pass the tutorial and actual fix the in game volume.Now, after that this is an extremely fun game. The arcade action is quick and fun and there's a ton of different configurations of parts to make your Rauser out of. Well, if a ton is equal to One Hundred and Twenty Five. Still, there's a lot of variety and each part has it's own mission objectives, giving some direction other than just scoring and adding to longevity to the experience. The four color aesthetic works wonderfully and the music plays to the action very well. Besides the red and sepia look there are other color schemes to unlock, most of which I've found are completely terrible, but they are completely optional and don't take away from the core experience which is so fun that the only real complaint I have with it is that I wish there was more!

												After about an hour of playtime, you will have seen enough to know what to expect from this game. That is not a bad thing in this instance because Luftrausers  is a great arcade experience that relies heavily on gameplay and control. Not much of a campaign or story to speak of, but the dogfighting feels sublime. Turning your customizeable aircraft in mid air after cutting the thrusters gives you a cool sense of gravity that reminds me of an old school game but with modern tight control. The devs haven't crammed a jillion gameplay elements into this hoping to add ""variety"" either. The core gameplay stands on it's own and let's you get right into the fray without a lot of BS. And when you die, and you will, you'll be right back out there fighting it out within seconds if you wish. This is what I want from indie games. A game that doesn't try to pad out the experience to feel like a big title, instead Luftrausers does one thing uniquely and extremely well and with a lot of style.			"

												Oh god I've only played 20 minutes of this game and I can tell I'm going to love it. You are a small plane against a crap load of other planes who want to horribly murder you. Basically the game uses a pretty cool mechanic where you can stall in mid air and turn faster. This gives you almost total control of your craft. The customization is also pretty cool. Different weapons, engines, and bodies do different things and make your plane look completely different. Total control of how your plane works and feels makes this game which is already really good with control feel like a joy to play. There are also many many ""One more run"" moments, and many ""How in gods name did I pull that off?"" moments which are pretty enjoyable in my opinion. The soundtrack is also total bliss, making you feel super pumped to do one more round with that new thing you just got. I've only played for 20 minutes and I already think my 2.50 USD was well worth the price of admission.			"

												My first time playing this game I was swearing with the vocabulary of a well educated sailor. I kept dying and had no idea WTF I was doing. Eventually I got the gist of the controls and experimented. After that I was hooked.With only 4 keys (Left, Right, Boost and Fire) you'd think it'd be easy. Just pop in, hold Up/Boost, fly around and shoot things... and you'd be wrong. The controls may seem simple, but it's one of those games where that simplicity leads to a whole load of complexity when it comes to mastering this game. You have to get used to the idea of letting your plane freefall now and again, boosting at the right time and dodging bullets. Get enough enemies on screen (and off) and the game begins to remind me of Japanese Bullet Hell shooters, there is that much going on, and it's trying to kill you.As you gain higher and higher scores and complete challenges, you level up, unlocking new parts for you plane, letting you customize it (doing so even changes the planes name). And each part has a series of challenges attached to it, so what challenges you have change depending on which parts your using.Seriously, for $10 this is a â¥â¥â¥â¥ing amazing game and one well worth looking into even if you don't like air combat games, because this is very, very far from what you'd get in something like Jane's.

												LUFTRAUSERS is an arcade type shooter in a very minimalist form but with sharp gameplay and addictive design that makes it extremely fun and gives it longevity. It's a game that uses very simplistic elements but makes the most out of them from just having a single ""level"" and track of BGM that are used in a way that adds to the exhilarating gameplay making each gameplay session escalate as you go on and offer further challenge. The longevity is provided by an unlockable-based system that rewards you as you complete different challenges which gives you a reason to alter your playstyle and rethink your approach.Definitely recommended.

												Luftrausers is an arcade-style game that ultimately fails to give a real challenge.  At higher difficulties and later missions, your success becomes dependent on random change to the point of absurdity.  For example, the last random engine mission requires 25,000 points on the highest difficulty.  In practice, this can only be achieved by killing a particular enemy which only spawns a small percent of given attempts, and hoping that battleships or large numbers of aces do not spawn.  There's little the player can do to learn or improve, just try again.Luftrausers also manages to have at least one frustrating bug, despite its simplicity.  The last thing you kill on a given life does not count towards your mission score, either for ""kill X of Y"" type missions or score-based missions.If you want a difficult game where you can slowly learn its patterns and intricacies without feeling like you're getting punished by RNG and bugs, Luftrausers isn't it.

												Someone once said this game has ""styyyyyyyle"". Well, I'm happy to report It has it in spades my friends. Luftrausers is basically Asteroids with gravity and World War I planes, and it really goes for the WWI aesthetic. The game is presented in a red and yellow sepia filter that pairs well with the WWI look of the menus and the various air and watercrafts.   You have goals that will unlock new parts for your plane that not only change the look and capabilities of your own craft, but also give the music a specific spin depending on the part you attach. This actually adds a lot to the game's minimal but stellar sound track.  There is no better feeling than when you become the plane! Once you wrap your mind around the controls, you quickly find yourself weaving in and out of a few battleship's bullet spray while pulling a 180 to boost THROUGH your pursuers. Okay, so maybe its more than Asteroids with gravity and WWI planes, and thats why I love it.Recommend it to a friend,Tino			"

												I've poured about 24 hours of playtime into Luftrausers and I can finally say that the game is very barebones. Sure, the floaty controls and 2D shooting is satisfying, for a few hours that is. There's only 15 parts to customize your aircraft with, 7 enemies to dogfight with, and 1 gamemode: shoot things to get points until you die. It's an endless wave game with some very frustrating elements to it such as the simple art style which is pretty, but can interfere when there's a bunch of similarly colored things on the screen and compounded by immense screen shaking when things explode and stuttering when you take damage. The ""100 challenging missions"" the game touts is nothing more than a list of basic and boring goals such as ""Kill a Blimp"" or ""Get a score of 8000"" that is effectively a list of achievements that quickly becomes a test of luck down the line with its pseudo-difficulty.The bullet hell nature of the game is also hindered by the fact the camera is heavily focused on your rauser despite all the airspace available, you will often find yourself flying straight into a cloud of bullets that leaves you a very small window of opportunity to dodge whereas other bullet hell games gives you view of the entire field to plan out your maneuvers. All of this and the game asks you for $10, not really expensive, but for that price one could buy other replayable games with truckloads of more content such as Binding of Isaac, Dungeons of Dredmor, FTL, or Risk of Rain. Wait for a sale if you're still thinking about this one.			"

												Hm... I really tried to like this game, but to me the controls are too ""floaty"" for a bullet hell. The physics just feel weird and you take damage randomly because the gravity sends you flying across the screen. I think LUFTRAUSERS is probably a good game, it's definitely well made. It looks good, it sounds good, it runs well, but it just isn't.. fun. I'm sure some people will like the controls but I personally prefer more tight controls, less ""get thrown off into the distance"" gravity, in a game that relies entirely on being precise. It would be so much more fun and a testament to actual skill by feeling like you're learning enemy patterns and dodging accordingly but instead I just feel like it's random whether a run goes well or not. I never felt like I was learning anything about the enemy patterns and I couldn't even focus on my objective because I was struggling just to feel in control of my plane. I get that it's an arcade-style game but lack of content and ""loose"" controls just make LUFTRAUSERS so hard to enjoy for me. Your mileage may vary and if you're looking for a neat score attack game and don't mind having imprecise controls, you'll probably like this game. Maybe I'm just bad at adjusting to the physics and trying too hard to play it like 95% of twin stick shooters/bullet hells, but controls like this just don't feel right in a game about precision and accuracy. It feels like I'm adjusting more to myself moving than what any of the enemies are doing. The menus are also really too simple for their own good. I wanted to look at controls to see if there was anything I should know because I skimmed past the tutorial. It then made me remap every single control and I tried pressing b to exit because I had no intention of changing controls, just viewing the defaults, and it changed my controls for good. I then had to delete the inputs config file to reset it, still confused as to whether there were deeper mechanics. In conclusion, LUFTRAUSERS is not the twin stick bullethell shooter I wanted it to be but rather a weird, floaty physics shooter. If you can get used to the gravity of your plane, I'm sure you can have a good time with this, but I think some people will just find the control scheme too esoteric or obtuse.			"

												Look, this is basically a Flash game, like the kind you'd play for free, packaged as an application.  However, Luftrausers is $10, it features an abysmally-balanced set of weapons and add-ons that are just full of bad ideas and poorly-designed features.  Gameplay-wise, it's vaguely borrowing from Defender, Asteroids and most of all, Wings Of Fury (which if you haven't played, do it NOW or get the FREE clone of it, Wings Of Fury 2, which isn't bad).  It's a physics-based game, kind of, except when it's not.My biggest critique is that you don't make progress; you unlock a bunch of stuff that looks cool, but mainly isn't.Stuff like ""body that's a blade that makes you weaker than default but doesn't insta-kill hard baddies on impact hits so net the heavy armor does more DPS + survivability"".  Basic stuff.  Stuff that should have been addressed, if not at release, but in a patch, after the developers had a chance to get away from their product for a while and then played it, rather than merely testing features.So the game gets hard, basically Nintendo Hard, but you're stuck with the (few) combinations of parts that are actually worth using at all and a bunch of features, like dropping bombs, that feel like they should have been available to every body type, because it was one of the few interesting things.  And then you get to the end and are going to be like, ""well, that was short"".Compared to Wings Of Fury, this is a simplistic game that is pretending to be a lot more than it is.  I did not honestly feel like I got my $10 worth, and I rarely ever feel that.It's like they made this at some Code Day in about 24 hours, then slapped a very basic UI and some hired-gun graphics on it and then called it Done, frankly, with no further follow-through to improve the core balance of the design, a very limited selection of enemy types, and game mechanics that basically just punish you for making progress, without mitigation.  There isn't a story; there's nothing to get emotionally involved in... it's less interesting in those respects than any smallish title I've played recently.The game doesn't even have a difficulty setting, for example, so for a lot of you twitch-challenged people... you'll just hate it, frankly.This is the kind of game where if you actually long for games that were just brutally hard to keep you from noticing how bad they really were in the 1980s, then you're probably moderately happy, but I don't actually like the results much; it's like they borrowed liberally from the past without understanding it very well and then were promoted by All The Right People so that suckers like me would shell out $10.  It's rare that I've encountered a well-mentioned Indie darling with less to really offer for the money, though.Never again, Vlambeer- either build decent games that deliver real value and patch after release to get balance and the core of gameplay halfway decent or fuggitaboutit.

												Once you get the hang of the controls this is a super fun shooter. You fly a cute little plane which you can maneuver into all sorts of amazing (if slightly unrealistic) stunts and flips, to out run and out gun the many enemies on screen. The aim.... Survive as long as you can..The longer you survive the more intense things get, so far i lasted about 5 miutes max with bullets and planes gunning for you from all directions.. There's some customisation availible for your plane which adds a nice bit of choice to the way you can approach the game. There's something special about this one			"

												LUFTRAUSERS (roughly translates to ""air-routers""?!?!) is extremely personable and conservatively enjoyable. The soundtrack is award worthy and the game is presented really well visually. I can't say comfortably that the simplistic left-right-stop-go flight play is as sensational as the feeling provided by flying a little too close to sea level, but the controls are responsive and the physics just berserk enough to provide fast game play that doesn't feel as acid-trippy as something like Geometry Wars. This is quite bullet hellish, but difficulty comes from maneuvering an airplane with two speeds (on and off) rather than raw, unfair amounts of projectiles. All in all it is a very charismatic arcade game with a scare amount of content but a **** ton of flavor. A good ten dollar game, a great five dollar game, and an even better summer sale clearance type of game.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is a fun, challenging little game with suprisingly good replay value, given that the game essentially consists of a single stage with endless waves of enemies. LUFTRAUSERS is the most basic of arcade shmups in that you play until you die and hope to get a high score. However, it has more depth then most games of that type thanks to a range of interchangable parts that greatly effect your Rauser's performance in combat. You may choose from weapons, fusilages and engines, each with very different behaviors. Each of the many, many combinations has its own name and there is an achivement for trying them all once, by far the most time-consuming one. You can also change the game's color palette away from its default, deliberaitely monochromatic sepia tones, though most of these alternate schemes will wear on your eyes. The music also changes to match each configuration of your Rauser, and the game comes with the seperate audio tracks to create your own remixes. While thin for its list price of $10, the game is well designed, with responsive controls that challenge you rather then hamstring you, and an overall stylish presentation. Well worth getting on sale.			"

												This is one of those lovely game that tries it's best to not be extremely difficult just for the sake of it, but sadly, is. Between the extremely low health and damage that any Rauser combo produces (in comparison to what you are up against) you still get overwhelmed easily.The game goes from slow to bat-â¥â¥â¥â¥-crazy in a matter of 30-45 seconds. The combo counter resets far too quickly and is impossible to keep if the game decides to stop spawning the little weak planes. Battleships often spawn on top of eachother and create a hail of bullets that even the high armor body can't eat. The randomization makes it far too luck based.Overall, this game makes a real solid effort and I am sure many people are up to the challenge. This game is for them. I however will take a pass on the ""drag-your â¥â¥â¥-across-razorblades"" difficulty in hopes they tweak and balance the game a bit more. Maybe introduce a planes only or boats only mode, etc.			"

Even my friends, who I recommended this game to immediately after playing it, can't even get it to work, so I couldn't possibly recommend it to you, lest you become one of the dozens of people online, on forums, or even looking for help on this games page, that can't get it to even work at all.

												This is a game I want to like but seems inaccessible most of the time.

I do like the art style and music as it feels energentic and reflective of the subject of the game.I played with a controller and had most of my issues with the menus and just overall turning of the plane. Everything else worked well enough.The reason I am giving this a negative review because I think this game needs a difficulty that goes along a pace as the game does rather than crazy amounts of bullts and enemies that act unrealistically and unfairly.

												There are bullet hell games, and then there are ""RNG death sims."" This is the latter. Enemies will be shooting at you from so far off your screen you just have to hope and pray that you are zigging and zagging at the right time... And even then it won't matter, because an ace will fly up right behind you as you're trying to dodge the battleship shells and just put 4 in your tailpipe. I constantly found myself at the edge of the viewable playfield, which made it all the easier for a newly spawned enemy to just ram an extra bullet or six into my ship. If the game allowed you to lock the viewscreen center on your ship, the game might be a little more fun.The game is difficult only because you are not given enough data to put up a fair fight. I don't appreciate it when they make the game difficult by severely handicapping the player, though it does explain why the game gives you massively overpowered weapons that you then have to fire blindly off the screen to hope you'll hit something.

												This game is a critical darling, and I have no idea why. The music is cool. But the gameplay was boring, and frustrating. The controls are super sketchy, and it feels like when you have a good run its more luck than anything else. And the ship upgrades that you are working for never felt like upgrades, because they would do stuff like increase speed, but lower how fast you turn. Not sure why it's so loved, definately a try before you buy.			"

But none of that makes it any less fun.  Maybe not $10 of fun for some people.  But for $6 or $7 it's a no-brainer.  Very solid arcade-y dogfight action shooter with nothing getting in the way of the kick-â¥â¥â¥â¥ destruction.  Get rausing!!			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is an interesting bullet hell game based on the flash game LUFTRAUSER. Your goal is to survive long enough to get a new high score by taking down enemies and thats about it. You dogfight with planes which you can get upgrades that work in different ways. The best part in my opinion is the music as it is one of the few games that make me feel stress and excitement when dealing with mass numbers of enemies, plus each plane upgrade changes the music giving you multiple tracks to listen to. The retro style graphics are a good call to use as simplicity makes the best of this game.8.5/10 A simple but well made arcade game that will in the long run have a lasting appeal to any Steam user. Great music, fun gameplay and the perfect game to play in short bursts.			"

												A really fun little indie title from one of the most proficient indie studios out there.Luftrausers is a remake of an old flash game called Luftrauser (originally not Vlambeers game). The remake has enough new and fun content that will keep you consumed for the next week or so.The greatest part about Luftrausers is without a doubt the combat. With the added gravity added to each airplane you'll feel like there's real weight in your Rauser when you're gliding through the air while shooting down a swarm of enemies. Added to this there's also a bullet hell feel to it where you dodge bullets and missiles while trying to get that extra score multiplier.The game also has a dynamic soundtrack that changes with what parts you use with your Rauser. The changing music keeps the game fresh even though you've heard a similar track several times before.The only negative that I can think of is that some parts (weapons/armors/engines) are a bit unbalanced and needs more work. It would also be nice if it was possible to crack down on the cheaters whom riddle the leader boards.I'd personally highly recommend this game for all bullet hell, indie and arcade fans out there. The game is hard, but also so rewarding when you get the hang of it.			"

												While it has its moments, it doesn't have enough to provide me entertainment beyond just a few minutes. Its biggest issue is the pure lack of content, or rather the rate at which you unlock new airplane parts. Maybe 20-40 minutes into the game I unlocked every single plane part (except for the top secret last ones), and thus I really had nothing else to play for. While there is that final unlock, it just becomes a technical challenge and a grind due to the lack of unlockables, which makes for painfully unfulfilling gameplay.Overall I would give this game a 4.5 out of 10, because it gets very old very quickly.

												""Ik suis dus met m'n kist door het zwerk, en dan schrik ik me toch bijna kassie wijle want m'n blikkie staat in de hens. Ik dus achter me kijken en daar zie ik linke loetje met z'n proppenschieter m'n hol te belazeren. Zoals je weet ben ik geen schijtlijster dus draai ik m'n pieremegoggel om in de richting van die linkmiegel om 'm z'n zielement te geven. Nou, die branieschopper heeft zoveel luppen op z'n smoel gekregen dat ie de volgende keer meer als een geeltje nodig heeft om met een lekker mokkeltje plezier te hebben.""First things first. LUFTRAUSERS is a portmanteau of the German noun ""Luft"", meaning air, and the Dutch ""cant"" verb ""rausen"", meaning a lot of different things involving reckless or loud behaviour.And indeed, the name is already half of the game. Without much of a warning pseudo-imperial-germanyish Dieselpunkland finds itself under attack by all kinds of flying and seafaring vessels. Enter the customisable Rauser of your chosing and deal death to those vile unknown aggressors! The battlefield loops without end and with every enemy you destroy the difficulty and number of baddies increases as you navigate your fragile little plane through an endless stream of bullets.This game does 2 things really well. First of all, the music (I think I always write something positive about music in my reviews...). There is only one track of music that you hear while playing. It starts off with marching feet as an underlying beat and slowly works its way up to a heroic climax. The instruments change depending on the parts you've used on your Rauser, which is a really neat and well executed idea! It is a great feeling if you survive long enough to hear the triumphant climax part of the track.The second fantastic thing about the game is the sense of flying and speed you experience. Even tough its a 2D game, you really get a feeling of flying at break-neck speeds through the sepia coloured clouds. The controlls are just great. Stalling in mid-air, suddenly boosting away from danger, making bombing runs, it all just works like a charm. Its one of those games where you only have yourself to blame if you mess up.			"

The best thing about the game to me is that it doesn't require much of the player. It is easy to jump in and out, but still make progress. The player is presented with attainable goals that are based on the modifications that are available and each modification is actually unique, which adds a great deal of variety to the game.All in all, LUFTRAUSERS is a ridiculously fun game.

I've unlocked about 15 new items so far and i still keep going back to the original config because the cons keep outweighing the pros. The real root of the problem is the fact that enemies spawn offscreen with no warning. THe number of times I've been doing well and then dip down into a new battleships barrage of lasers for instant death is crazy. I typically love all of these games with permadeath and upgrades. If you're into that style I'd recommend Rogue Legacy or Risk of Rain. If you have both of those already then Rogue shooter is also really fun.			"

												This game is another shining diamond from Devolver Digital, makers of one of my all-time game series Hotline Miami.  (It even features some recycled Hotline Miami musik, so you know that part is wonderful.)A triumph for pixel art in games.Works off the principle that what goes up must come down (YES!--gravity), using this physic to create a whole new twist to twin-stick shooter arcade play.  Also, playing like a suicide-bomber can be to your advantage as you can use your plane to melee enemies as well as to fire missles.  Very challenging gameplay (the achievements will most likely not be hard to cook through, but the game itself provides a beautiful challenge and you can compete for high scores).The art is simplistic, but subdued, easy on the eyes, and beautiful.  The art style is unique and fun, the kind of art you would expect from Devolver.  Beige color-scheme is interesting.  Play-style is customizable (you can alter weapons/parts of the ship).The gravity mechanic doesn't make sense in light of the German war Aero-plane theme, but oh well.  It's a video game  and absurdity is welcome.  The sky and water serve as a function of the game, not just backdrop, so I guess it all works.I came to love this game in a very short time and this is definitely doing to be one of my top picks for a long while.

												This game, is quite honestly, the most fun game I have ever played. With the quick unlocks of new kinds of aircraft parts, the different gameplay styles that come with them, and the great dynamic soundtrack make this game a fun, epic, and unique game. In addition to lovely music, each new aircraft part can add new abilities, such as exploding on death, being able to fly underwater, etc. The flying controls are also excellent! You can turn on/off the thrusters and rotate freely however you want, allowing for the many parts of your plane to show off how they work best. For example, if you have a spread gun, heavy frame, and a superbooster, you would lead a ton of enemies in one direction, then cut the thrusters and fire backwards. On the other hand, if you had the melee frame, laser weapon, and underwater booster, you would keep low, spear through ships, and take down planes with the laser. The possibilities in this game are endless and so is the fun! I would recommend this game to anyone, no matter who you are.			"

												This is a great ARENA BASED shumup. Know before purchasing that the ""missions"" are challenges like ""score 10k points"" or ""kill 3 submarines in one combo"", they are NOT unique levels like you would find in Raiden or Gradius. This ""one level"" game is meant to be played over and over again; it's very difficult. Runs can be anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes. You unlock parts as you go and after defeating a particularly large enemy, you unlock ""hard mode"". Good luck with that....Lots of unique ship combos with a different version of the Luftrausers original theme depending on what you pick. It's a really wonderful track, check it out on soundcloud if you haven't heard it. The controls are intentionally slippery but very well done. You aim your craft and then either thrust or stall, the challenge is cutting your thrust at the perfect time...weaving between the bullet hell and keeping your combo multipler at MAX. You unlock different color schemes as you progress, they're all pretty wacky.Luftrauser's arena loops like Defender, while the game controls like a bullet hell Asteroids. For $10 I recommend this game to fans of arcade shooters.   "

Usually I'd find it hard to reccomend a game that is unplayable for me currently, but I'm still going to with Luftrausers. It is incredibly fun - in fact one of the most fun games I've played in ages - which makes it even more crushing that I can't play it.

												If you appreciate building up skill in a game to eventually master it, this game very well may hook you.  The gameplay is a bit of luck and a lot of practice, with task and point based goals.  Shoot for a traditional high score using combos and brilliant maneuvers, or aim to kill harder and harder enemies up to the dreaded Blimp.The biggest calls this game has is its short round lengths, its high adrenaline, and that wonderful videogame feeling where you are an unstoppable boss until you mess up.If you like games where you face impossible odds, relying on a lot of practice, skill, and a little bit of luck, Luftrausers deliver well!

												This is a frenetic, side-scrolling dog fighting game and it's a lot of fun!  The fact that it's a side-scroller means that simply allowing your plane to fall is a valid movement strategy.  You have unlimited ammo and your health will regenerate but you can only use one at a time.  Your health doesn't regenerate while you're shooting so you really need to balance your approach to attack and defense.			"

												The fighting mechanics are unique but not in a good way, they are too clunky and make it very difficult and frustrating to try to kill ships. All rounds are mostly the same, the only drive is to try to kill as many enemies as possible before you die to unlock parts,  and it does not feel like your skill really matters in the outcome. There are no really interesting fights, badass bosses or in general some unexpected events to break the monotony, it's just the same brainless planes and ships that only have different degrees of hp and bullets. Just saying, for less money you can buy metal slug 3 which has much more content and much more interesting enemies, badass bosses, fluid mechanics, secrets, multiplayer ecc. All in all not much to say about this game, I did not find it particularly fun, and it's definitely not worth 9 euros.			"

												Ok. Really and truly I want to give this game a thumbs up. Gameplay's solid , the combinations are nice and it's generally a very fun experience.But the names of some of the combinations in this thing kills it for me; and other people who'd happen to be in my shoes also. I know they're supposed to show the would-be awesomeness of the plane you're flying, but ""Hellrauser"" and ""Fist of God""? Really? (I almost don't mind the ""Karaterauser"" and ""Batman"", albeit not by much.) Seriously, I don't see a real need to give the combos names proper to God alone/not to be profaned in one way or another. So please, change those names. You can come up with better titles than that.And I know there's a whole lot of you that disagree with me and will say ""just don't use those."" Again, it's not as simple as that. Once it's in the game, it can't be played. Of course the one thing I expect a whole bunch of you guys to say is ""then don't play it then, it's just a game. Get over it"" etc.But I needed to make that clear so that it could be possible for other people somewhere around my case CAN play this thing with a problem without boundaries being crossed and worst case scenarios befalling them. Like I said, I really wanna give this game a great score. I'd be recommending it if not for that.			"

												Great arcade game. Fun flying and shooting mechanics, different combinations of weapons and ship part unlocks. Challenging game. Decent variety of enemies but expect to be getting very familiar with most. Quite hard gameplay but very addicting. Despite very simple controls the learning curve goes up steep for the first hour then flattens a little for a decent time as you get slightly better, completing challenges and unlocking parts (and colour schemes)...and then it explodes up again. Don't even bother with SFMT unless you are ninja at bullet hell. I really love the main game though, only game on my work computer, not that I get a chance to play it. Which is why I have it all my vitas too. Buy. Let go of fire to heal. The game microfreezes to when you get hit as an indicator.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS is pretty much what it looks like: an arcade dogfighter. I was expecting a story mode or something similar, but all I got was a straightforward 2D shoot-em-up. That having been said, I am not in the least disappointed by what I received; this game knows what it does and does it well. It provides the classic arcade experience of scoring as much as possible without dying, throwing in for bonus the rush of excitement when you stall in midair, watching hordes of enemies and waves of bullets streak past you in a whirlwind of death. The stalling mechanic is really what makes this game so good; you can stop accelerating and simply let gravity do the work of dodging hazards for you, then after changing direction speed up at the last second and escape the jaws of death. Obviously it's not a lot of content, despite the number of ship parts allowing for a commendable combination of ships and thus playstyles. For what I paid, however, I'd say I easily got my money's worth.			"

While I like the game I feel like it needs a variety of levels or mission-objectives. Taking down the big ship is near impossible. I'm sure you can do it, but I never managed to do it.

												 ""LUFTRAUSERS"" is kind of an interesting indie game; it takes place in an alternate history setting, where in World War II, Adolf Hitler never came into power. So, in this universe, the Germans were allies, and the Nazi party never existed. The enemies in the game are the Japanese, the Russians, and the Italians. It's an interesting game where the main protagonist is a fictional World War II pilot. Anyways, the gameplay is quite interesting; with interestingly made 2-D graphics with a distinct ""retro-like"" feel to them, a high quality soundtrack, and interesting yet simple gameplay, this sure beats having to play the video game, ""Gods & Generals"". I highly reccomend this game, for anyone who likes alternate history-themed games. It's quite challenging, but it's supposed to be. I give it 4/5, saying that it's a simple, yet quite fun game, though $9.99 seems kinda pricy for this game, (I would reccommend getting this whenever it goes on sale) but if you're a die-hard fan of alternate history games or simply excellent indie games, GO FOR IT, because for a simple arcade-based space shooter, it's AWESOME!

												The most difficult game I have ever played. By far. Because it has the worst controls I have ever seen in a game in my life. No matter what, it is impossible to get used to the controls. I can't fly at all because the controls are so nightmarish. I don't care what anyone says, the controls are the worst in the history of video games. It gives me almost no real control over my plane. All I could do was fight gravity to stay out of the water but I just kept dipping down into the water. I can really only kill planes by unavoidably slamming into them. You have to stop firing to repair your plane but you still can't because the screen is filled every milimeter with bullets and planes that are impossible to avoid because you have no proper control over your plane. How this game got past their quality control team blows my mind. Obviously they have no QA department. Hopefully this gets taken down from the steam store and at least there's Hotline Hiami, which is pretty much the only great game that Devolver has made.0/10 horrible			"

												So I've now logged over 40 hours of play and I feel its time to update my review. I can now recommend this game BUT only for the game play and the controls, which are so solid that when you die you know its your fault. I say ""when"" because this is a bullet hell side scrolling sh'mup and you are going to die. This one is a challenge, again, I'm at 40 hours and I'm still 3 missions away from 100% completion. *sigh* There are still bits to this game that I find upsetting. Normally I would care less, but the game is soooo good that the little things to it are upsetting. ConsBeing color blind, I found that I can only use 4 of the 15 color schemes. The other 11 color schemes, I'm lost. Majority are horrendous anyways. I still find the 4:3 game play a huge disapiontment. I would really love to know the reason Vlambeer decided to go with this format.Still get lost navigating the menu... Yeah after 40 hours of game play. Calibrations! The controls are just too damn sensative in the menu and seem to be inconsistent at times. Controls just stop working.Aiming is still very difficult due to a number of factors. First, for weapons the have low frequence of shots, you have to guess when you are able to shoot again. Example missiles, you can only shoot 4 at a time. Sometimes they go rogue on you preventing you from firing. This is problem for health regen., keeping up your combo, defense, and offence. Second, the lower bit graphics also contribute.ProsEverything else. Final ThoughtTo put it simply, its a great game with the worst design. [Prior Review]+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+There is something I'd like to note before I review. I do play this game regularly in hopes that some of these issues are fixed. This review and rating may be updated.I love this game, which has some of the finest shmup action I've played. Beside the game play and the audio, for me, nothing else works. First off, I don't understand the decision the developer made with color scheme, more modes, more horrendous than the next can be unlocked to making it even more difficult than the last to identify enemies. A characteristic of this game that seems like a truely unnessisary hinderence. I'm really hoping there is a normal color scheme mode to unlock. Additionally, when you first load the game, you get the splash screen in wide screen, then in the game, standard. Black strips? What a tease, I can look past this small issue, only if it wasn't used a method to limit the firing range of the player and not the computer. Also with the graphics, I don't mind they are low res but it makes for difficult aiming without a line of sight or some other targeting method to see where you are shooting, this is critical when using weapons with a low frequency rate of fire. Next, navigating the menu's are a chore and shouldn't have to be. When you have 'go to' screens set to buttons that change on you pending the menu screen you are looking at can get confusing. The menu settings can be changed way too easily and inadvertantly as the controls are too sensative with no way to turn them down or even have dead zones. And how the heck do you exit the game? Well, took me a couple games to firgure out but you have to navigate to one screen to exit the game or even get to the options, that screen being what I thought was the start of the game. There really isn't too much more to this game and these intended unnessisary problems really do break my heart as I'm seeing a great game go bad. but If you are the type of gamer that can look past these problems, I do recommend this, but otherwise as it stands today, I can not. Maximum I'd give this a 6/10. That 6 easily could be a 9 or 10. Will update if game does. -RoX			"

												There are better dogfighting simulators avialble for free, there are better arena shooters for free.  I will provide examples if pressured.If you think the unique mechanics of this game itself make it worth purchasing, then the eb version is free and feels better to play, though it is still not very entertaining.The special part of this version of the game is that completing a number of missions will unlock new ship parts and extras like cutscenes and background color swaps.  The ship parts are all given strengths and weknesses, but they are poorly balanced to be overpowered or useless.  I will provide examples if asked.The missions themselves do not directly relate to being ""good at the game"", and one can quickly earn all ship parts and a randomizer but save for the last three without beating the game once (It took me around four hours).  The music is made up of a universal part and three parts that are assigned to each part of your ship-- in other words the music has a very large chance of being disjointed and offputting, not around long enough to stick in your head, and , worst of all, gimmicky.  If you play with the randoms on so that you have a chance to ue some of the useless parts instead of playing with the superior build.The extra backgrounds are likely to be offputting save for one or two, based off of your color preferences, and even the faded black/white (beige) film aesthetic seems tired and uninspiring.  The main and common grunts are too easy to take care of, and only pose a threat when they are in groups of more than ten, and the large battleships are too powerful.  Once you learn how to fight the battleships, then you are able to survive until the enemy dogfighters arrive--- which are actually fun to fight instead of annoyances like the blades of grass that are the grunts or the trees that are the battleships.Though, to even have fun DOGFIGHTING IN A DOGFIGHTING SIMULATOR, you have to make it through the boring first section,which happens to be very long.  Then, while you are polishing your skills, the boss will show up, leaving no time to enjoy yourself.--To be continued--			"

+ Nice background music that fits very well with the game+ Unique very addictiong mechanics (you can spin and change direction to dodge bullets while gravity is constantly pulling you down, however you must stop shooting for your health to regenerate, so it's a mix of dodging while trying to find time to shoot)+ A variety of different weapons, engines, and body parts that create a different experience each time + Challenges (which you need to complete to unlock more parts) are similar to achievements, and make you play differently each time depending on the challenge. (like kill 5 boats)+ The Airship boss is pretty awesome and takes some time to figure out how to defeat it.- There's no health bar, so it can be hard to tell when you are about to die. Basically a circle appears around your plane when you are close to death.- The Difficulty can feel a bit unfair at times, it's randomly generated so some playthroughs are easier than others.- There's really only 1 level in the game, so I feel like it's lacking content / repetitive- The Screen-Space is quite limited making it hard to see where enemies are			"

												This game is tough and super fun! I enjoyed unlocking all the ship parts and trying to see how far I can get. I don't think it's going to hold your attention forever but long enough to make it worth your time.They nailed the mechanics on this just like they did on rediculous fishing and super crate box. Each piece of the ship changes how it flies and you can find a ship that fits your play style. I had LASERS!I look forward to anything Vlambeer does now.

												LUFTRAUSERS (yes, it's actually allcaps) is an arcade-esque bullet hell shooter in which you are a RAUSER, aka, a plane 'ace', as it were. As a RAUSER pilot, it is your job to protect the Fatherland with glorious engineering bestowed by... blowing up â¥â¥â¥â¥.LUFTRAUSERS has fun, addictive gameplay, and retraux graphics that somehow manage to be more detailed than a lot of other games relying on the same art style. Sparks fly from your plane, smoke billows from damaged enemies, and explosions shake the screen like you've had too much coffee. The overall feel of playing is seriously engaging, as every shot you take and every movement you make feels... just fantastic. For every major accomplishment (such as, say, blowing up your first battleship) you get a short little cutscene celebrating your accomplishment, making you feel genuinely proud of your amazing skill.Upgrades are unlocked fairly frequently, but the real challenge is unlocking the final three mystery parts. Trust me, that â¥â¥â¥â¥ is worth it, and don't spoil it for yourself.For those of you who truly find joy in pain, there's also an unlockable SFMT mode, in which the game takes it up to 11... and breaks the scale. Good luck surviving that.In short, LUFTRAUSERS is a seriously engaging, pew-pew explosions, defend our engineering and take down hordes of enemies with this plane, simulator. Worth it at base price, must-buy on sale.			"

												LUFTRAUSERS, a game as whole as it's own trailer entails it to be, not much more but perhaps less then one would expect from a 10 dollar game on steam. I have not played the Flash version of this game, but after playing, what is in my opinion, an overpriced flash game. Here are a few reasons why:Controls:It is easy to tell from a mile this game was made for a gamepad, as none of the menu screens have mouse control, and more often than not end up taking you where you did not want to go in the first place. An example would be trying to costimize the Rauser, getting to the Hanger is as easy as pressing right with the arrow keys or D-pad, but instinctively would immidiately start trying to optimize the desired prefrence for the craft. Instead have to confirm what you want to customize the plane, a simple rotation selection screen, then have to press X to set the plane as complete. Key-binding is awful, a set track of trying to understand what you want to bind to makes for a frustrating adventure, where a simple sheet simply saying what key is for what button would have made this game worlds better. On top of ths, it appears I cannot find the file that contains the text file to easily bind what I want to which key.In game flying feels unnatural as well. Accurately aiming the Rauser in one direction is harder than it sounds and is pure frustration when this game could do with precise free aim instead of this ""single stick control"". More often than not I turn in to Kamikaze dolphine that wasn't build for the water. Being shot by things off screen does not help either....Graphics:Sepia pixlated style. Again, something that the trailer covers, but, this makes certain  projectiles, such as the lazer, disappear behind clouds, and the beam is the exact same collor, shade and tone of certain things with the background. The amount of things on screen feels alittle empy. As I said, being shot off screen is a real pain, with no indicator of where the enemy is after the shots have travelled far off and more accurately that the hopeless Rauser that sprays blindly in to the distance hoping to get a kill, percpetively wishing that you had the same sight range as your enemy AI, BUT MOST CERTAINLY DON'T. This is what makes me feels extremely cheated when playing this game.Sound:Music? Exellent. A bit overpowering at max volume (ingame settings) but good. That is, one track slightly moddified with your craft's load out. Other game sounds? intentionally styleized with the look, but nothing outstanding. Could easily be replaced with someone making ""pew pew"" and weird lazer noiced with their mouth and it'd be the same._____For something that started simple, it sure as hell stayed that way to be pushed out with a price tag on it. There are many games that follow similar pixle art style and are easily better than this. This is a game that could have had LOADS of more content for what we pay for, but sadly not worth the 10 dollar tag this game asks for.Could easily be better.			"

												To go by the basis that I rate games now, (Throw out to Yogscast Nilesy) This game isn't quite worth the money. The game is unique, and addicting at first to see what parts you can get, but once you get them all it becomes boring very quickly. There is a highscore board, but in reality that's about it. You can go through all 100 levels and play for days, but the levels are EXACTLY the same, abesolutely nothing changes between them. So I have to say this was a bad purchase.

												Not exactly fun to be stuck on a group of quests you can't do.It's bas in the sens that it's not realistic enough, nor unrealistic enough due to how the flying works. Stop to turn? Could work if the game was meant to be better than it is now where you can only shoot straight ahead, so you'll be falling down towards an enemy while firing, and not being able to see the enemy until it's too late to turn and fly up.

												Luftrausers is a game where you engage fighter planes over sea. Made by Devolver Digital and Vlambeer, it has a delicious arcade feel to it, meaning it can be played for 5 mins or 5 hrs, depending on the mood you may be in. Multiple enemy types to destroy, many leaving the player with a great feeling of satisfaction (I'm looking at you, battleships and blimps).There are lots of different parts available to the player for the customization of their rauser. There are also many unlockable color palettes to choose from, which allow you to change up the flavor of your rausing here and there. The difficulty is perfectly scaling, increasing a little more with each kill, each passing second of your continued survival. The one big drawback I've found with this game is no multiplayer option. Even a local VS mode would help add so much more variety to this already immensly addicting game. If you like techo/electro music with a sort of diesel influence, you will love the soundtrack of Luftrausers. It has a great selection of tracks which perfectly match up to the setting of your aireal combat. If you are looking for a mobile-esque timesink, look no further than LUFTRAUSERS!9/10 needs moar firepower			"

												LUFTRAUSERS (the title is, apparently, all caps) is a very simple 2D arcade-style game. You control a plane which flies around and shoots enemy planes. Unlike a schmup, where you proceed left-to-right or top-to-bottom, this is a side view, looking at a plane flying over an ocean, dogfighting vertically and firing on boats below.The game has a highly non-standard control scheme â you can fire, you can boost, and you can pitch your plane up and down, in a full 360 degree circle. The controls are very simple and kind of unusual, but you get the hang of them after a while.The game has 8 different enemy types â basic planes, a nastier kind of plane, giant blimps, basic boats, submarines, battleships, and two rare enemy types which almost never spawn. You will encounter them all in fairly short order, and at that point, youâve seen all that the game really has to offer â there is an alternate mode which is basically a bullet hell mode, but even the regular mode can start bordering on that at times.You can customize your plane with five different weapons, five different bodies, and five different engines, each of which alter the gameplay of the game in reasonably significant ways, but ultimately the variety granted by these unlockable parts wears off after a short while. There are in-game missions which allow you to unlock parts and color schemes, each of which is attached to one of the parts, with each part having six such missions attached to it. If you beat all the missions, you unlock a final, alternate plane.Really, this game is decent enough gameplay wise, but it just doesnât have much depth to it. It is really simple and there just isnât much variety to it in the end, so youâre likely to get bored with it after a short time.If you got it as part of a bundle or something, it might be worth looking at, but it just isnât worth buying â it just feels too simple to feel like an adequate stand-alone game.

$2 Flash Game with a $10 Pricetag$10 for this?! Are you for real?! Got this at 75% off and I'm still not sure I got the money's worth... it literally plays like a free flash game you find online.-The game is fun for the first ten minutes but it gets repetitive very fast. You see all of what this game has to offer pretty quickly. The lack of enemy variety doesn't help. There's no motivation to continue playing except for the objectives on the plane pieces; 90% of which are easy as all f*ck and the other 10% are basically impossible without blind luck (Oh hey, that rhymed). If you're an achievement hunter that's into some mental masochism- here's your new kink-The only thing this game really has going for it is trying out differen't airplane combinations. I won't lie, it is fun seeing/playing the different combinations and reading the unique names for each one... but that whole experience is quickly sullied when you find out how repetitive it still ends up being. Thinking up some clever/funny names does not justify a $10 pricetag to me. Most of the combinations really don't change the gameplay at all either (only two that I can think of that really do any major gameplay changes the Melee body and the Underwater engine). Any other piece than those and you'll be flailing in the air firing aimlessly. -People are saying the controls are really tight- but I found them to be quite loose and floaty. Maybe because I used a controller? It hindered the gameplay signifigantly. It's nearly impossible to react to split-second situations... which is all this game is (a bullet hell of split-second situations). You'll be spending a majority of the time shooting frantically, not tactically. That's not to say you won't be shooting tactically (good luck taking down a battleship otherwise) it's just most of the time you'll be spamming your shots in a general direction hoping to hit something as opposed to actually aiming to hit something. I know, that's a factor in most (if not all) bullet hell/arcade shooter games like this, but it just seems way more apparent in this one. That it's entirely Luck > Skill. Dying every 2mins, just to respawn at the exact same point everytime, with the same slow start up everytime.... it gets monotonous fast. The controls could of helped that, but they don't. Least not with a controller.-Good luck if you wanna try rebinding keys. Misunderstanding the (easily misunderstandable) menu can get you to a point of being forced to manually find and delete an innocuous file in your /%APPDATA% folder... just to return the controls to the default settings... instead of a simple ""Reset to default"" in the options menu. Don't believe me? Go to the community hub and read the first Q&A on the FAQ. It's that much of a problem. I'd be willing to gamble that there's a recent post there with someone complaining and/or having trouble with the key bindings right now if you went and checked. The store page says ""Full Controller Support""... as far as I'm concerned, that's a lie-The ""cutscenes"" are a joke. Literally just flashes one picture when you kill one of the (7 or 8) different enemies for the first time...  I know it's an arcade game and all, but damn, why even bother if it's gonna be that terrible. Almost seems like a slap in the face after a certain point.-To top everything off you get a pretty ugly/stale looking theme and a lot of the other themes you unlock (the other only real attraction to this game (unless you're a closet nazi or something)) are either buggy or just hinder most situations by making enemies harder to see.If you're looking for a small, ""pass the time"" type of game just to blow a quick 10-15 minutes... I'd still say you can spend the time better beatin' off. Or, if you're tired from all that jerkin', you're still better off buying something like 'Bit Blaster' for 99c. 1/10th the price but 10x the fun. Ironic, too, because that game lists this one as one of the developers inspirationstldr -  This game is way overpriced for what it offers. If you really are sold about getting this then wait until it's on sale 75% off or more, or you'll probably regret it. "

												In a 9.0 review in EGM from 2014, Luftrausers is described in this way: ""Hearkening back to a bygone era of simple-yet-deep arcade games where you played for score, not story, Luftrausers takes basic ideas in concept and execution and turns them into hours of challenging, chaotic fun.""I agree with all the above, so you can stop there if you wish. Indeed, in Luftrausers, you get to make your grandfather proud, who served in an Unspecified War on an Unspecified Side as a decorated kamikaze fighter and managed to fly experimental laser-based *cough cough* Luftwaffe aircraft in the nostalgic era of Unspecified global conflict that spawned such innocent things as Popeye and nuclear fission and resulted in that same grandfather hiding in Rio de Janero for a few decades to conceive your mom and maybe eventually you too. It is a game that depicts acts of aerial valor and ultimate sacrifice on the wings of physically impossible aircraft diving in and out of the water to kill a lot of people for fun and high scores.I'm not trying to act surprised that this game called Luftrausers is what it is. It's supposedly funny, but I don't really get the jokes. If I throw on a fedora and crack a whip and punch the makers of the game in the face, I'll also go on record saying their game ""belongs in a museum!"" but specifically in the museum of Things A Lot of White People Thought Were Good Ideas, alongside a collective self-assurance that Resident Evil 5 is not racist or colonialist in any fashion, despite a macho government agent stomping through the Congo to accidentally shoot a whole bunch of dark people in the face for being diseased. I mean, as we all know, Starship Troopers is just an awesome stupid action movie about beautiful people fighting a good fight.I honestly don't get it and you are free to try to explain to me where all the elusive self awareness or ironies lie in the game. What are we supposed to make of this alternate reality version of Joust from Man-in-the-High-Castle America? What's the point of going after these aesthetics? Is the music that evokes the sound of countless oiled black boots marching only a ""gentle nod"" to a movement that murdered millions of people? Some idiot thinker coined the phrase ""all's fair in love and war"" and Luftrausers is low-key cool with donning a crisp SS uniform if there's savage arcade action to be had with an inbound bass drop. How quickly Dieselpunk gives way to Nazi-punk! If you pitched this game to me, I'd say it sounds fun. If you then showed me your private box of concept art next to pop-pop's secret insignias, I'd stop letting you out of my line of sight, expecting you to turn your feckless eyes on me to ask if I actually believe the Holocaust happened as some kind of secret handshake you expect me to accept.

												LUFTRAUSERS is addicting, let me start by saying that. You customize your plane, take to the sky, and have some bullethell fun.When I say it's addicting though, I don't mean it in a good way. It's addicting like heroin or crack cocaine is addicting, at it's core the game is barely playable.The game mechanics are fine, really, they are, you fly around in a way that no pilot should never ever have to fly (i.e. cutting the engine off to make a hard turn, spinning in circles just to engage at the last second before hitting the water), shoot at boats and planes, and later, shoot at dirigibles and submarines. Let me start with that first one: I saw one review of this game that described the game's controls as ""flawless."" This is in no way the case since it feels like someone took a bullet hell, stapled that vector graphic Tank battling game to it and called it a day. In no way should anyone have to control like this in a bullet hell.As I mentioned before, you can customize your plane, and this is neat. But this is where the game falters THE MOST. Most of the unlockable parts you, well, unlock, are absolutely useless. You can unlock a melee fighter body which can ram into thinks without even getting a scratch, but when you realize that this is a bullet hell you should be uninstalling the game. You can also unlock a few other bodies, but all of them are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing useless with the exception maybe one or two. All of the other bodies basically cripple your plane in the hopes that you'll find the tactic fun or interesting. The weapons I don't really have a problem with. They all have their ups and downs with the exception of missile, which no sane human being would ever use, but for the most part they feel finished and polished. It's such a shame the dev didnt take the time to â¥â¥â¥â¥ing do the same for the other parts you can apply to your plane.And then there's the amount of parts you can have. The game's store page boasts 125 combos to add to your plane, but when you factor in the undeniable truth that most of the bodies and engines are â¥â¥â¥â¥ing useless, you're instead left with about 50 useful combinations. And, while 125 may seem like a lot of parts, YOU WILL UNLOCK THESE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR, POSSIBLE EVEN LESS. THAT'S RIGHT, ALL OF THE PARTS WITHIN AN HOUR. I.E., THE BIG GOAL  OF THE GAME, IS ACHIEVABLE IN AN HOUR OR LESS. If they don't expand on the part customization section of the game, or at least improve what you get, I see no reason to even touch this game.Also, you get to unlock color schemes for completing the entirety of a challenge tree. They're eyesores. And the names of these color schemes are the devs' names backwards. â¥â¥â¥â¥ING. CLEVER.The game's prequel was a flash game called LUFTRAUSER. With the tacked on S, it makes sense that this is not the only â¥â¥â¥â¥ing thing that's tacked on. Don't buy this game.			"

												Quick paced arcadey dogfighting. Gets very tense but is very exciting too. By letting go of the throttle you continue flying but can turn very rapidly by throttling in the direction you want to go, which makes larger dogfights much more about agility and compensating for your lack of it than just getting hits off. The plane can be customised by switching gun, engine and body and every customisation radically changes how you fly and even changes the goals you have to complete to better suit what you've chosen. Also, the music changes depending on what you have equipped, which is a cool feature. However, if you're pretty good you should be able to complete the game in about 2 hours if not less and in this respect it feels like you might not be getting as much bang for your buck as you would with other titles at a similar price point. You may want to consider waiting for a sale before picking this up (which I still do highly recommend).			"

												Well, Lets just say....This game is great. While it feels a bit lacking at first, as you continue and unlock the parts, you realize as soon as you start SFMT mode then you all the sudden realize that the game took off it's training wheels.Good luck fellow Rausers			"

												This game's just fun, all around.  The game screams either Indie or older Atari, but it has sooo many points working in its favor:Pros:Easy to understand controlsSimple, yet responsive and charming graphicsCool soundtrack that changes based on parts you choose in the hangar.Perfect for quick play sessions when you don't have a lot of time.Cons:Still haven't got that blimp yet.Best $5 I've spent since FTL.

												This game does one thing, and one thing only, but it does it really well. Shoot some airships, dodge some bullets, shoot some other ships, and all in relentless tempo. You can fumble around with your ship for a bit, but i can only appreciate the 'luftrauser', 'jaws' and 'hammerhead' setups, the rest just slows you down too much to dodge te unbelievable streams of bullets ships throw at you. Not playable for long periods of time, but a great snack everytime you pick it up, and one of the best one-trick-ponies out there.			"

												Fun and surprisingly addictive little arcade game. Great for short bursts on unstressing after a bad day in work or something. The challenges are rather uninspiring, but still very satisfying when you beat them, so you tend to go back to play some more. Great music and nice retro look feel totally spot on. And I'm glad the color palette is toned down, otherwise my eyes would start bleeding after 5 minutes of the mayhem that happens on the screen. "

												Fantastic game for everyone.  Game is easy enough for casual players,  but has another harder mode incase you enjoy pain.  If you don't like the color scheme, you can unlock new ones bew completing mission specific to your Rauser.Can be a pain to close the game.  You have to die before the game lets you exit.8/10, would play again.			"

												If you like score attack games, this is a gem. You play as one plane amongst a tirade of other angry planes (and boats... and more) trying to shoot you down. You can customize your plane to perform the way you'd like it to. The mechanics are flawlessly executed. The music is decent and while the visuals are certainly bare-bones, it works really well. This is a compelling game that I've been picking up and playing here and there when I have a spare moment. Definitely get it on sale...			"

												The game is beautiful and the controls are smooth.That's pretty much where the good stuff ends.I am somewhat a fan of rogue-like games but... I would say that the difficulty curve is steep, if there was one. You're thrown head-first into the thick of things and the weapons and armors you unlock seem to be just making your job harder. It was fun the first hour. Then I unlocked hard mode, where I have yet to last more than 20 seconds. This game is incredibly disapointing.			"

												This game is wonderful in all ways EXCEPT it's options interface.  If you incorrectly edit your controls you can render the game unplayable.  This is a huge oversight.  Beyond the problem of a poorly designed options menu and ability to exit the game, it's great.  The actual gameplay is fun and fast.			"

												One word review: a-RAUS-ingWhat can I say about this game that will do it justice? Short answer. Buy. This. Game.Luftrausers is a 2D, bullet hell, combo based dogfighting game which sees you playing as what is essentially a Nazi fighter pilot in not-so-WW2. You customise your ""Rauser"" with tonns of different parts that have their powers and weaknesses, like an engine that lets you fly underwater, but will receive more damage if you fly too high, or a body that explodes like a nuclear bomb when you die, allowing you to do a last ditch Kamikaze into one of the many enemies wanting to ruin your day. You can customise your weapon system, your body, and your engine. Depending on which parts you pick will affect the soundtrack in drastic ways. Overall, this game is an absolute gem. Any PC can run it, it has a load of replayability, an amazing soundtrack, slick retro visuals and at a fiver, its a bargain. Pick it up and get Rausing.			"

												When LUFTRAUSERS goes, it really GOES. Your fighter aircraft launches into the air. Give it a second or two, and a horde of smaller planes start chasing it. Battleships fire at you from below. And then larger planes start bringing down the pressure before a blimp threatens to obliterate you (that is, if you havenât been obliterated already).Your challenge is to survive the frenetic action and take down these vessels as you weave through the enemy fire. The balancing act of returning fire and then letting off to allow your fighter reprieve to heal up is core to your gameplay.Experimenting with the different combinations of craft parts, completing missions and racking up higher and higher scores is all part of the fun here. LUFTRAUSERS is THE modern bullet hell-esque / arcade shooter game.			"

												Even though I have not fully played this game on this account, I have fully completed it on another account. I have to say, not only is this one of the best dog fight games out there, it offers replayability that is normally only shown off on games that are open-world rpg. Overall, one of the best games I have ever played, and if you are in doubt, I highly recommend you go on their website and try out the 'prequel'. It shares most of the same mechanics, and will show you if you are interested in this genre of games.			"
