												This game in it's current format is completely unplayable. The game breaks entirely by day 31, and even though I had only made one film by that point, I really was not totally upset by not having to play any more. The game lacks any real feedback on what makes good combinations for the most part and the lack of customisation is extremely disappointing. For example, I decide to make a film set in the Stone Age, but there are no Stone Age themed characters. Then at day 31, the game shows a pop-up that regenerates infinitely. It is quite incredible how disappointing this turned out to be. Then there is the fact that the game required me to install an additional application just to run which I was not expecting and it is extremely poorly translated in places. These issues and the droning music barely seem worth mentioning in comparison to the abject awfulness of the main game. Spend that money on almost anything else.			"

												Thought this might be a fun game. Unfortunatly when starting it says to put your name in player 1 i do that and i cant see what im typing untill i hit enter then it shows the name. so i start the game and inside the game when i try to look through menu's ect or pick from the list to put people or things in the movie i cant read anything in the bubbles where the options should be they are blank. so i have to pick blind? and an then maybe see what i have picked after its to late. this makes the game uplayable.  anyone know how to fix that?hmm toying around with things i went to the steam file an loaded it up in the win mode it give and can actually see the text unfortunatly its in window mode and id rather play in full screen. but yes mine also wouldnt go past day 31 either			"

												I really like the idea of the game, but it's still a good way off from bring a great game.There are too many negative parts within the game, such as being robbed, shot at and losing a lot of health for not paying $6,000,000 to the mafia, then losing 28 million in a fire at the studio caused by the mafia anyway, are ridiculous, along with losing 12 million at the casino and never winning one of the hollywood races!Anytime i get near $100 million i lose half of it for the reasons above.The markting and merchandise sections could do with some work too, i dont think the marketing even has any effect on salesThere is a function that allows you to create scenes and scenery for your films, they are too boring to even want to do, could do with sprucing that up, or even having the option to hire staff to do that for you.A bit disappointed but still like the idea of the game			"

												Game is soooooooooooo bad.  You spend all this time trying to get the formula for a movie right and you get no reward in return.  No visuals or anything.  Just plain sucks....			"

												Very basic, graphics and gameplay, when you consider THE MOVIES game was over ten years ago this game seems to be ten years before that, lacking in content and playability.In making your own movies? well unless this games animation improves later on with owning a studio, forget it.I found this game boring for the most part but might revisit it because I like the genre.Don't waste your money hopefully a decent updated movie game will come along soon.Summary - Plays like an old Commadore 64, text and pictures and not much action also webpages link not working.

												It's the most boring game I've play. First of all, I'm fan of tycoons, strategies and simulation games. I have never disliked a tycoon game before.But this one, it just doensn't have a clear goal. You must choose scene after scene (there are a lot of them) prep it all, but the results are the same if you did it on the auto mode, pick only the first and last scene and let it roll.There's no fun or strategy in that. If I could, I would try to get a refund for the first time in my life. Yes, it's that bad.			"

Status;""ABANDONED/BROKEN""************* CRAP STAIN ALERT!!*************************Since our last review back in April 2015 something has happened to the game or developer. It does not work properly and not one patch since his release. Single german developer who we talked with when the game released, has apparently decided to take the money he made and ran or take a permanent♥♥♥♥♥♥on society and fans.  Either way, the only safe assumption since it sold very well, and since... critckets or farts in the wind... is all we know.... he had a great thing, and kind of as it stands now in 11/14/2015 total garbage now. So this guy is in need of a good fonging!Never even completed the English translations either. Sad again.

												The idea is solid, the execution... not so much.Making movies sounds cool, except you can't really see or understand what you're doing half the time, and the things you do understand seem pretty bad.  Making the poster comes off like something from a 3rd grade art project and when I tried to upload an image myself, the game crashed.Maybe it can be fixed... but I doubt it.I'd stay away.			"

												After the bug was fixed it seems to be working just fine. Game is fun to pass some time.Old Review - Game breaking bug on day 31. Sabotage pop up that will not go away. Reloading does not solve and unable to play any further.			"

												This game barely functions and is in all honesty rather boring. It has a very interesting premise: you're a director and you need to claw your way to the top of the Hollywood hierarchy, but it doesn't deliver. I've only played for a short time but in that short time, it has become obvious that the gameplay is repetitive, unexciting and dull. Your money is better spent on Video Game Tycoon or another more interactive tycoon game.			"
