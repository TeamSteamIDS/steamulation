												Wildlife park 2: Horses is a Survival Horror standalone expansion to the base game 'Wildlife park 2'. The objective of this game is to own and manage your very own horse stable and to avoid getting kicked in the nuts by the horses on a daily basis. This game add's a new chapter to the survival horror experience that puts Resident evil and Silent hill to shame.It has graphic scenes such as giving you the option of ripping out the reproductive organs of any horse you click on and also allows you to watch as the various horses sodomize eachother. Review update 2016: What makes Horses happy? Apperently not 4'x8' living conditions.			"

												A great game for horse lovers! Especially those who're fed up about cathing butterflies...+ Most facts and scenarios are well researched.+ Easy to learn and understand+ Good variation among the missions+++ Unlike most other horse games, this one isn't cutified. There are no missions about petting cute bunnies , catching butterflies etc. The focus is more reality oiented than that.- The zoom is limited. One needs to be able to zoom out more while building.- The herd composition doesn't matter, which is quite unrealistic. In real life stallions don't get along with each other if there are mares in the same herd.- The missions are quite few and simple			"

												This expansion adds a good couple of horse and pony breeds. Most have coat color choices as well. Wish they had made this expansion for Wildlife Park 3 as well. I definitely enjoy being able to have horses in a game without the tweeny gameplay of having to brush and ""doll up"" your horse. Just note that as a part of the Wildlife Park series, there is ""realistic"" breeding, so a word of caution to people who may be buying this for younger children.			"

												I wouldn't recommend getting this game. While it was fun for a while it has become super buggy. I also noticed that I was getting a ton of pop ups when I went on the internet. I uninstalled the game because it was so bad I couldn't even use my internet. Uninstalled it and all the pop ups went away!			"

												Whatever you do, don't delete the well in the bear's enclosure when in missions D:Good little time killer of a game.Pros:Lots of horses! (you can actually ride them)More animals than just horses though. Breeding is insanely quick. @_@Lot of creative options as visitors love decorations and♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Use DNA to recreate extinct animals! Cons:Graphics are oldBoth animals and visitors are crazy picky. They freak over every tiny thing and you spend all this time trying to make them happy and then they aren't happy anyway.Had a mission to get horses to jump over fire, they refused. RIPMay have some errors on trying to leave game (minor)The community is kind of dead?Overall I'd recommend, but do try to grab on sale ;D "

												I have just bought this and I have no idea what to do. There are no instructions and trying to do anything is a real pain, there are arrows pointing to things and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I can't recommend this at all. Perhaps I'm missing something... Wish I hadn't wasted my money.			"

												I really love this game, there's so much detail! But Ill be honest one thing that greatly dissapointed me was that I cant groom or ride the horses myself. :( I run this place 24/7 and I get to watch strangers ride my horses?! I had to spend a bunch of money to run this horse farm, my horse farm!!! But I cant ride or groom or my own horses?! WTF?! Sorry but that was kind of the mayjor highlight of buying this game. :( Really disapointed, would have been a perfect horse game otherwise. </3			"
