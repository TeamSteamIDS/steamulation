												As city-builders run short these days, i decided to have a go at this game. When i first started it i had in mind all the older city building game i already played such as SimCity, Cities XL, the Anno series and Sierra games (Pharaon, Zeus, the Caesar series...), the last which apparently served as the main inspiration for this game. Thus, i was not surprised of the game mechanics which mainly consists of starting from scratch with three objectives that need to be filled. You then start to build some houses and production buildings, and the way to proceed is as i said above based on Sierra's mechanics: citizens need a certain resource/building in order to upgrade their houses, and therefore increase the rent income. Run short of any resource and the houses will shortly degrade to the highest level it can attain with the remaining ones.Production on it's side consists of running a production chain which may consist of one up to three buildings in order to well... produce resources. These resources can be either used to satisfy citizen's needs, be sold at trading routes or given to the few events (up to three per mission from my experience). Some other elements have been included such as crime or fire, with respectively the sheriff and fire brigade in order to fight against them.At this stage of the review you are probably thinking ""Well that doesn't look so bad, does it?"". And unfortunately it does. Let me explain you why, in the same way as i described the game above:You start each game with three objectives: there is absolutely no time-limit or constraint of any kind. There is no other way to lose the game then through bad management, which is nearly impossible after a playing for a few hours. You can start from three ""difficulty"" options at the start of each mission, but it does only impact the first few minutes of play.The resource management of this game is very simplistic: The raw resources are produced at a steady rate, never influenced by seasons (grapes, grain and cotton all the year! ) nor resource availability (hunters producing without animals, lumber mills without forests...). Stock management has been dealt with by giving your warehouse an unlimited storage capacity. You cannot predict as well the resource supply and demand of your city easily, as no production and consumption summary is given, which means that you will have to over-produce all goods required to avoid stock shortage.Trade is the simplest form that could be included. You pay a ""fee"" to open the trade route with a city, and then after you can import or export goods from there. Goods are imported/exported at a fixed price, with unlimited quantity. This means that you can sell the town next door 100k logs of lumber at the same price, and import 100k crates of beer, without any impact on future trade or product price. Production capacity and demand are simply not taken into account in this game. This lead to a ""give me money"" button that can be pressed once in a while, without thinking any further.Wages and rents are also fixed, population satisfaction is simply not taken into account, and unemployment's only impact is the color of the total population indicator. Hazards like crime and fire are solved by having the relevant building, effectively leading the risk to 0%. Other natural hazards likely never happen, or even if they do their impact is so minor that you do not even need to take them into account.One back side of this game simplicity is that a resource shortage (non-anticipable as said before) can lead to total mayhem. A  house degrading can mean worker shortage (which has no proper indicator), and this shortage can escalate to a complete desertion: some buildings required by citizens are shut down, leading to further house degrading, leading to further work shortage... A simple feature to give work priorities could eliminate this issue but it has not been implemented.To sum up, this game is simplistic, terribly easy, and becomes quickly repetitive. I can say without any risk that after playing this game for 2 hours like i did you will have gotten all that this game has to offer. The only difficulties that can arise are not part of the intended gameplay but are the result of a lack of management tools and features that are included in most other city-builders. Despite having the full california on the main menu and a large map when starting a game, you are confined in a tiny square without any opportunity to expand. That shocked me first but after playing for a while you understand that this space is all you need to have a working untouchable, steady producing money-farm.To finish this review i wanted to say that i understand that this a new indie development studio, but i just took a look of the game description of this store page. ""complex cities"" and ""deep simulation games"" are not the words i would use to describe this game. On this opposite i would use the words ""simplistic"" and ""casual"". This is typically a game you could run on social networks or mobile phones, but in no way a city-builder simulation or resource management game.Recommendation:- For new players discovering the genre: This game could be an interesting first city-builder to play, but you will soon outgrow this game and regret buying it in the first place. If you want to start with a city-building game you should look for classics such as the ones i listed in the first pagagraph.- For experimented city-building games players: Do not buy this game as you will feel robbed after playing for a few hours. Used to more complex management games it will feel like riding a car on a carousel after being used to drive a real one.Sorry for the long review, but i didn't want to freely throw a bunch of critics without explaining why i came to these conclusions.

												I'm not in the mood to attack other civilizations after building my own city from scratch and I like a little more of a ""story"" when I build up my things, so I thought 1849 was going to be a nice panacea to my City Builder Sim illness.Not the cowbell I needed.1849 is very slow and frankly easy to win each level. However, it is time consuming. The majority of the time you've built the required number of buildings and you're waiting for them to accumulate the needed number of supplies to move onto the next section of California to colonize. The plot of land you're given is relatively tiny, given how much you can really move around.Each game I was given an ""edge"" from completing a previous round. There was no right or wrong answer to what helps you, just whatever helps you in how you finish the objectives in the time alotted. This, I found helpful. It benefitted my playing style which is very kind because I have a certain way I like to set up my time management games. It also allowed me to experiment each level.What drove me relatively bonkers was that nothing really changed from level to level. Usually there's something new introduced that makes a very significant impact, but this never happened in my course of playing. I had to use multiple important buildings because the reach was impossibly short and your town/settlement will go to hell in a moment's notice and you will not salvage it unless you can accomplish a few key things in the first few moments of establishing your settlement.But once you figure out your pattern of play, you generally just sit there, wait for your settlers to upgrade their houses, and just keep refueling things.It's perhaps the worst city building sim I've played and I was highly disappointed. Wasn't worth the price I paid. I've honestly just sat still most of the time and done absolutely nothing. It's also a bit dated-looking as well so there are prettier games out there for your money.Maybe this could be a game to teach small children about areas of California during the Gold Rush, but I don't believe this could keep their attention too long. This likely plays better on a tablet or a phone, as well. Personally, I'm not a fan and even after forcing myself to give it a good go, it wasn't meant to be.  "

												It's old-school city building game on Wild West. Definitely smaller and easier to start than for example Anno games. But on the other hand, every mission in the campaign has different set of prices and available resources, so you have to build the city in a different way. Also every mission takes usually less than hour, so you can play even if you don't have a lot of time.Is it good game? Yes, 1849 is good game.Can it be better? Also yes. Interface may be definitely easier to use and there are still some minor bugs.VERDICT:If you are in mood to play city builder but you don't have time or just not in the mood to play something big as Anno, give 1849 a chance, it may be good choice.If you're modern player, and graphics and sound is very important for you, check the screenshots and keep looking.Like this review?

												This is a nice casual city building game.I would describe it as a western World of Zellians with a bit more complexity.There are 20 scenarios to play,  each with different goals aimed at growing your town.You start off simple and add houses,  industries and other infrastructure, trading with other towns to meet the scenario goals.There is a sandbox mode if you just want to build for the sake of it.It is not a difficult game although you have to keep your eye on things at all times.  I bought it cheaply in a bundle but i think the full price is justified based of the length of gaming there. "

												Do you like casual games.....  Do you like city building.....  Do you like watching illicit movies at night to the soft sounds of Kenny G.... wait a minute!  You'll find the first two in this game.  1849 is a very simplistic game about balance.  you need to find the right balance between workers, supplies and cash.  That doesn't sound too difficult at all, now does it?As a casual game it does just that, very pick up and play, you can waste a few hours messing around in the various scenarios.  Feeling a bit flustered pick up right where you left off, or start that scenario over.   Word of advice be ready to turn the volume on your speakers down as the game is choke full of the same looped audio you hear in the trailer... As you can imagine after 5 hours of hearing that same tune....  Temper raising, need to kill raising, haring same loop over and over again makes Orge a not so nice man.If you're into hardcore city building... this game won't satisfy your itch, if you enjoy minor dabbling into city building, finance simulators, and dressing up like a cowboy and pretending your dog is a horse, than this will be for you.  So I suggest you buy the game, buy the DLC and by all means enjoy yourself a nice relaxing casual game of  1849.  Come on, you know you want too!			"

This game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer.1849 is city builder set in 1849 during the California Gold rush. I haven't played many city builders in the past apart from SimCiity2000, so my experience is very limited so far. The graphics on show here are pleasant, there is nothing special, it almost looks like the same style in Theme Hospital, sort of plump looking characters, and some nicely textured buildings. Each mission in the story modes offer roughly three objectives, these can be as simple as trading a certain amount of a resource with a neighbouring city, or to reach a specific level of social hierarchy in your city. The missions can last anywhere between 15 minutes, up to an hour. The audio is done very well too, a classic cowboy tune plays in the background as you have your bustling city sound effects playing too. I really liked the music, I found myself dancing in my seat at times without realizing it. From the tutorial, right until the later missions, you are walked through every new aspect of the game. I found the tutorial here to be very well designed and prepared you greatly for the missions ahead. There is definitely a high difficulty curve in 1849 too, once you get past level five, there is a sudden change in difficulty, and the missions become more and more in depth and you have to really focus on managing all of your resources and trades as efficiently as possible. This isn't a bad thing, it's nice to see games offering the challenging content. I am about three quarters of my way through I think, and I am up to almost five hours of game play, there is also a sandbox mode included too, which will end up probably having around twenty plus hours in total from 1849, which is a lot considering it is only a £10,99 game. I didn't find myself encountering any technical issues, runs very well although it's to be expected as it could probably run on a potato. Would I recommend 1849? Sure, it might not be everyone’s cup of tea, but coming from someone who hasn't really played city building games, this is probably one of the better ones to start out playing. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up. You can also find more reviews over at http://www.completingthebackloggroup.com/ "

												1849 is a game where you need to manage one city, leading it to prosperity in a very unique setting! As the name suggests, it's set in 1849, during the California Gold Rush. Your main focus, as you can guess, it mining for gold, as well as other minerals, and building full cities out of it (seldom self sustained; lots of trading with other cities is involved).   I'll make it clear right away that I have never played a city management game before, so my standards may be different from yours, as I have nothing to compare it to.    But I've found the setting to be interesting, and the game's aesthetic seemed to add to it well enough, so I bought it, and finish it. Here are my thoughts. Presentation   As you can see from the screenshots, this is no Tropico or SimCity with full 3D graphics, weather, and the sort. Not at all. As this is from a small team, they've opted for a more old school graphic style, with prerendered backgrounds and sprites. It may make the game seem very static, but each building has a sprite associated with a work-phase, and the townsfolk are also animated and walk around the city, delivering materials, going to the saloon, etc.    I think it looks really cool, and certainly not something you see a lot of. Everything seems to fit the setting (although I'm nowhere near an expert), and gives the game an unique vibe that works very well with its limitations. One problem is how blurry the sprites look when you zoom in a bit too close... Then, it looks a bit too rough. But you never need to zoom in as much, and it ends up looking great, for the most part! Well done here.   The music was good, but at the same time, a bit too repetitive. I like the western country it gives, adding to the atmosphere, but it's the same few tracks over and over again... Yeah, it ended up feeling too monotonous for me. What I ended up doing, was googling some other western country music (similar to what I heard in the game), and I stick to that instead. Unfortunately, I didn't find a lot from that time, which is a shame. It would be great if the developers could give the player some directions regarding finding other music, improving the overall experience for sure!   The sound effects were good for the atmosphere, but always ended up going overboard, leading to a cacophony of work noises or general gibberish. It can be annoying. I believe that each building played a sound, which lead to lots of different sounds being played at once, in busy moments... Since it felt like the same clip over and over, it wasn't very pleasant for me... But it's not too bad, you can turn it off easily.   Just another issue here, is the fact that there are no audio sliders of any sort. It's just SFX and Music On/Off (separately).The game was clearly designed for an iPad, and the interface shows that a lot, creating problems that should not exist in a PC game...   Now, about the game's structure. You have a campaign with 20 different missions, each consisting of a city. In these missions, you have a checklist of 3 different objectives needed to succeed. As you play, there will also be 2 ""surprise"" comissions from the Mayor. These are optional, but generally provide you with a small benefit, in the form of upgraded buildings for free (although only in that particular level). There should be achievements for these, but the only ones who work are in the last level. All the others don't register, so there's that...   At the start of each city, you'll also have 3 starting options, depending on your playstyle. Some give you more money, some open more trading routes, more food, mines, etc. etc. All things considered, they only seemed to affect the very beginning of each mission. Once you're set, they all play very similarly.   Different cities will have different trading routes, and different types of buildings you can build. This could have been great for variety, and increasing strategy, but it's flawed. First off, you have no infomation about it when you choose your starting conditions. This is BAD. Very bad. So many developers give the player uninformed decisions to make...!    Then, there are the comissions. There's also no information about these beforehand, which means that you'll be caught by surprise, usually with very little money, and having to change your whole approach if you want to meet those requirement. Why? Because the comissions usually ask for materials you have no use for! Half of the time you can't sell them, so you just build structures to get them in time, and then it's just wasted space. All for a few building upgrades... In hindsight, I probably would have been better off not doing them! Oh well...   The limitations imposed to you regarding the farms you can use also seems very arbitrary. There weren't any radical terrain changes to justify these, which means that it just felt a way of forcing you into different directions. The same with trading routes, I have no idea why I can't create more flexible paths to make perfect use of my resources... Maybe it makes sense from an historical standpoint, but that's never explained. barely anything regarding the Gold Rush is explained actually, which is disappointing!   Then, you have the Sandbox Mode. This sounds fun, right? Just building you city, endlessly expanding! ... Well, not quite. You see, you'll be able to choose different areas on the map, some larger, with more coastal area, more minerals, etc. But they're all pretty limited levels. And there's no objective at all. I understand what Sandbox means, but even some comissions would have been very welcome! There are not even random events that can happen to throw you off guard (at least none that I've seen)... So, it ends up being very laborious. You simply repeat what you've done during the campaign, but this time, with no goal. Just mindlessly clicking things, reaching for infinity... I really do think this was a missed chance. Comissions would have helped with variety, perhaps some bandits would increase robberies, earthquakes, I don't know... there are lots of possibilities, but I've seen none of them, so yeah.    I'd stick with the campaign, and no more.   Aside from all of this, the game just lacks challenge, as well as options. First, there's no automated trading. Which means that you'll have to buy everything manually (and selling), making it hard to keep a constant economic balance. Then, even if you want to check your stock, you'll have to open another menu to see that, with more tabs and clicks than it needs (because I'm playing this on a mobile device... Oh, wait.)...    Each road must be built one by one as well, as well as every building. I think it would have benefited a lot from a selection method to construct more than one at once. Or even giving shortcuts to the different buildings. I have lots of buttons on my keyboard, and none of them seemed to do a damned thing! There's a lot of clicking through menus here, unnecessarily so.   The lack of challenge comes mostly from the lack of good objectives, and monotonous progress. There are no events to make your life harder, you just keep building until you're infinitely rich! The only difficulty was in the comissions (mostly due to omission), and maintaining a large mansions at the end. That's because each requires a plethora of different resources that you'll have to constatly keep trading for. Without automation, it's very easy to let things slip while you're doing something else, and then everything downgrades because they're lacking shoes... Or newspapers... Because that's what defines a mansion.Sorry if I couldn't explain the mechanics all that well, but I've tried to focus on the negative points that I've found. I did not enjoy the game very much due to this lack of input from the player. It's just managing time and money, with no risk or reward. It's not awful, but not a great game!			"

			Cosmic takes a look at indie city builder 1849 developed by SomaSim. Enjoy this review make sure to subscribe! Twitter - http://twitter.com/Cosmicengine99 Facebook - http://tinyurl.com/q5vpc63 Twitch...		

Hello I'm Cosmic and welcome to indie city management game 1849 developed by SomaSim. The premise of the game is well, obviously its 1849, and gold has just been discovered in California. New towns are popping up left right and centre from mining towns to farming communities. Now I'm English so I'm not much of an old timey prospector type but dang nabbit we'll give it a jolly good go.1849 is all about city building and management, straight off the bat those who played games like Pharaoh and the Caesar series will be instantly hit with a sense of nostalgia. I played the Caesar games extensively and huge comparisons can be drawn to it, its clear that 1849 was heavily inspired by those games. The game has both story mode and a sandbox mode. Story mode sees you progress through a variety of towns with different objectives as the Californian gold rush takes hold. You'll build mining towns, farming towns and towns for educated families to live in.One you start, you start with a storage depot where all your resources will be gathered. You'll have to build homes for people to live in and start some agriculture as people need to eat. Building cost money, and you only have a finite amount. Housing is a source of income from their rent but production building cost money as you have to pay wages. As your town increases in standards and resources housing will upgrade to offer more people per house and more rent. However production buildings will far outweigh the amount of housing required which is where one of the more interesting game mechanics come into play.Similar to the real world, no town is completely self sufficient. This means while you may have a town with an abundance of iron ore your town may have no access to the production of fabrics. Trading is a massive component of the game, each town  you play has access to several trade routes with other towns, these require money to open and you can then import the materials you need and export the materials you don't. Money management is a big factor, making sure you don't go bust is crucial which means making sure you have the best housing for rent and are regularly exporting your overstocks for cold hard cash.On top of your standard objectives you'll also come across optional telegram missions where by you'll be rewarding for attaining certain objectives. Usually this comes in the form of exporting X amount of materials to town Y or making sure you have excess materials in your depot. The rewards of this missions usually help you out greatly and if you can achieve them, they often are well worth doing.City building is very similar to the Caesar games, things like roads and and housing don't cost anything to place. Production buildings will cost varying amounts of money and you'll have to make sure you have enough funds to not only build the building but make sure you don't go bankrupt when the next round of wages come in. Speaking of production you have to follow the process the whole way through. Simply building a wheat farm will not feed anyone, you'll also have to build a bakery. Even further down the line as you unlock more complex industries, things like mines will require more than just money to upkeep but also equipment too, like pickaxes.I really enjoyed the city building in the game, it is not as micro as some similar games but it captures the fun of the genre and makes the process simple and easy to use. Returning to the management side of things, you'll have to do more than just watch your wallet. As your town grows you'll have to deal with disasters such as fire in which a fire department will be needed if you don't want fires to wipe out half your town. You'll also encounter a human element, as more people influx into your prospering town you'll encounter unemployment and if you don't provide local amenities such as a saloon, people will become unhappy. Crime is also a big factor, 1849 was a tough time for folks and the lure of a prospering town full of gold is too much temptation for some. You will have to build a sheriff to enforce some law in your town, if you don't production buildings will start to get robbed which halts production and steals precious resources.Overall 1849 is a solid indie city building sim that captures the fun of previous games in the genre. It's well designed and thought out and its progression is well paced but also adds a good challenge to each new town. While not a micro management sim and it doesn't have the depth of a bigger city game, its a well put together title that has plenty of value for money. If you enjoy games like Pharaoh , 1849 may be right up your alley but if your looking for a more in depth realistic city sim you may wish to look else where.			"

												Fostering a rough-and-tumble western town sounds like a good time to me, but alternatives to the traditional city-builder don't always go as planned. The balance between expansion and resources is a delicate one, and straying too far from the middle can be disastrous. 1849 has the right look of a builder and starts off well enough, but you'll soon find it doesn't go much further than that.As the name and the stylings might imply, 1849 is set around the time of the gold rush in the western U.S. wherein thousands of scruffy types made their way to California to grub for gold. Your job is to build settlements for them across several different scenarios, sometimes focusing on trade or a specific resource, other times going for a certain population level. You provide plots for migrants to set up homes on, and those plots upgrade automatically based on the resources you provide. They need food, firewood, booze, hides, and so on if you want to move much past a shantytown.If you've got it in your head already that you're going to be building your very own Deadwood or watching drunken cow-punchers brawl at your saloons, let me stop you right there. 1849 is a very basic city-builder that hinges entirely on the flow of goods through your settlements. You build wheat farms to make wheat, bakeries to turn wheat into bread, and so on. The only action you'll see is some hot & heavy wheelbarrow pushing through your crowded streets. All resources flow through your warehouse at the center of town, so don't get too creative with your layouts because you want all your production buildings as close to the center as possible.That's not the only limitation the game has for you, either. Your income is based on rent from your residential plots. All of your production buildings cost you money in wages to operate, so you're looking for the perfect balance between residents and wages. Unfortunately, it doesn't exist. You'll need twice as many residents as can work at your buildings to turn any sort of profit, and unemployed settlers become criminals who steal from your buildings and disrupt production. If you have too many residents the criminals will strangle your cash flow, and if you have too few you can't afford to run your buildings. This means no matter what, your town is going to be lopsided towards unemployment and criminals are going to be forever nibbling at your bottom line.There's trading to do between cities but it is the laziest possible implementation of such a system. Each scenario has a short list of things you can buy and things you can sell. To start trading one resource you pay a huge up-front fee, and then after that you can exchange goods for money instantly. I assume this is how you supplant your income without spawning criminals but there's no automation to it, you just have to remember to push the ""give money"" button every few minutes. It's also easy for your city to stagnate under this system if you don't open a key route at the right time, because your balance of residents can get out of hand and keep you from saving up the money to open the route needed to prosper.You'll find no end of little aggravations like this in 1849. Once fire brigades are introduced you MUST build them immediately or every single one of your houses will inevitably burst into flames. There are no tools to track production rates of resources so it's trial-and-error figuring out how many farms and bakeries are needed for a given population. The maps are also depressingly small, preventing you from building a sprawling frontier city. Not that you would be able to anyway, since there's a very limited number of buildings that all look very similar. The sound design is adequate but the graphics are a blurry mish-mash that will offend your eyes unless you're playing as far zoomed out as possible. It's not the worst way to spend an hour or two but you're not going to find any of the freedom or growth that is the cornerstone of the genre. And that's doubly ironic for a game about westward expansion.			"

												1849 is a nice SimCity-like casual western citybuilder that isn't as deep but still fun to play, and every member of the family can play it because it's so easy to pick up.I think everyone has heard of or played SimCity before so I'll spare you the details. You just place buildings and hope to attract as many residents as possible, which results in you earning money to build even more buildings.The graphics are okay, but if you zoom in you'll definitely notice the blurry sprites. So... don't do that too much. The music has a certain western vibe which is good, and the sounds are pretty basic but okay too, I guess.1849 wouldn't be my first choice when it comes to citybuilders, but if you have a younger family member, or an older one, start with this one. It's so much easier to understand and play for them, I think.[Rating: 70/100]			"

Teal DeerDevelopers: SomaSimPublishers: SomaSimInitial release: May 2014Genre: Simulation #Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorth Exposition, Concurrence and Summation1849 is something that at first glance looks to be nice, quaint, relaxing little affair. Build a simple western town from a single isometric perspective. No pesky angles and rotation to get in your way. It turns out 1849 is anything but relaxing. In 1849, you are tasked with building a city to support trade, commerce and the oncoming onslaught of tourists ready to strike it rich and find some gold.  Look, I thought this game looked fun, a nice distraction. But to be brutally honest, its bad. Its unbalanced, its tedious, its unfair.. for no reason. I started in on the campaign a bit hoping to get a grasp of things, sure enough I did. I figured it was more directed in during that type of mode so it was a bit tougher on you but it turns out that even in free-play its awful. I will attempt to explain, there is an economy of resources that your city can make and export or import with money you've earned through selling your products. The thing is you must first establish a trade route, so far so good, however there is no way to make trade routes for anything other than what 4 other cities want. As in the seed you generate at the starting of your map, should it not have lumber per se, you are completely left out in the dust. There is no way to make lumber and therefore no way for your city to expand. You need to collect rent from houses, you need to create jobs for the residents of those houses, However the cost of running the businesses to employ them is generally higher the the amount of rent you get from low income housing. So, what do you do to keep your city afloat? The short answer is sell any and all goods not needed for your people to whoever and anyone that will by it. You'll need food obviously, you'll need lumber for houses and expansion, and you'll need some variety of alcohol to satiate the peoples boredom. And because production and running costs are at a premium you'll need to import something most likely being lumber. Which in my experience costs three times as much as anything I was exporting such as shoes made from animal hides and brandy made from grapes. Without selling the goods I was losing money on production costs and even after I sold them any disasters like earthquakes or random fires and rampant crime do to unemployment  made my cost of importing lumber even higher. Bringing me and my city down further and further. A cycle I could not break and in fact saw fit to make me bankrupt.  I should mention that even though this is a city builder; it makes no attempt at any point to become automated. As in every time I needed to sell my exports I had to do it manually making it even more tedious. It's come to my attention this is also a mobile game and I have nothing inherently against those however I do know they are in general designed to be played in very short stints which this game does indeed evoke that sentiment maybe TOO quickly. It doesn't seem very in depth but its not shallow. Its just not worth your time, money or effort. THE GISTAll in all, I just can't recommend this game to anyone.. for any reason. Play Cities: Skylines. I honestly thought the throwback to static isometric camera angle would make things a bit easier to grasp but the game seems so tilted towards your destruction its just not fun on any level. No.. just say no.Follow my curation for more "

												I may not have many hours of play on Steam just yet, but I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say I have already clocked at least 100 hours on this game ever since I got it on IndieGameStand, so I thought this game deserved a nice little review for all potential fellow players out there.The premise of 1849 is a classic one, and the game may not have loads of different buildings to build or hundreds of different resources to collect, but rest assured that it has more than enough to keep you busy for a long time. The casual-looking interface hides a challenging city management simulation and everything in the game works together just perfectly. There are no electricity grids or traffic jams, but the simple yet challenging resource management and production chain systems are crafted wonderfully and the game stays engaging, inciting you to expand and to find the perfect balance between farms, factories, saloons and houses. Make no mistake, 1849 is casual and I love its refined simplicity because it makes the game so easy to pick up, but at the same time it plays like a true management game and it can get quite hard, and I love it equally - if not more - for that.And as if the game mechanics weren't enough, the game is also set in a period of time that easily speaks to the imagination and that has been crafted beautifully in the visuals of each little part of the game. In every building, every tree and every person walking through the streets you can feel the atmosphere of the bustling town you're shaping where only moments ago was nothing but forests and meadows. Combine that with the challenges from the management mechanics, and it's easy to see why this game gives you such a rewarding sense of accomplishment but at the same time gives you the need to keep going and keep making your town better.I got this game in the daily deal on IGS for only a few bucks, but knowing how much I've already enjoyed playing this game I would happily pay full price for this game that is quickly becoming one of my favourites.

												I spent a snowy weekend playing this game and I doubt I'll play it much more (if ever again.) In general, I am a huge fan of city builders and after reading the mostly positve reviews I was psyched to give this a try. It is probably one of the most limited and frustrating games I've ever played.The type of resources you can create/gather/mine/farm are pre-selected from the beginning and sometimes make no sense. I hda one game where I needed to export stone bricks, but couldn't build a stone quarry. so I would have to buy stones, then turn them into stone bricks, then export them for less than the cost of the original stone. Also, you can't tell the quanities of anything (this is a pet peeve of mine in city builders.) How many vinyards do I need to make how much wine, how much wheat makes how much bread (and how much bread is needed per citizen?) You can't unlock new trade routes. You can't unlock new buildings. Sometimes getting off the ground is incredibly difficult, other times, building a massive city, that can quickly become unweildy because for instance, the lumber cycle, lumber -> boards -> furniture, is extremely slow, so you may for instance, run out of room to put lumber yards.Anyway, overall, disappointed. Graphics were cute but you can't do anything more than zoom. You can't rotate the view or objects. If you're looking for an afternoon time waster, maybe try this. Otherwise, go check out Tropico 4.

												Overall, “1849″ has a lot to offer but does so in such a way to where you won’t need a lifetime supply of Excedrin Migraine to keep up.  It’s a somewhat casual experience but still can challenge even the most hardcore city-builder fans.  I suspect that part of the game’s design has something to do with the fact that it’s also available on mobile devices, though this isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  Don’t let the cartoony graphics deter you, however…there’s plenty of content here to justify its fifteen dollar price tag.  It would also serve as a great primer for tougher resource management games like those found in the “Caesar” series, I feel.  The campaign can be a little limiting at times with regard to the buildable structures available on any given map, but the sandbox mode helps to alleviate this problem.  All in all, a cute (but tough) “little” game.Full Review:http://www.dadsgamingaddiction.com/1849-final/Alpha Gameplay Videos:

												Pretty and simple city builder, maybe better suited for playing on tablet than on desktop computer. But it still offers about 10-15 hours of gameplay in campaign mode. Sadly there's no replay value whatsoever, there is a sandbox mode but maintaining a large population is a bit tedious and definitely not fun.Major drawback is the game's price, 15 euros is a bit steep.

												A nice casual city builder game where you have to manage resources to increase your population and in turn grow your city.  Nothing overly complicated and simple to pick up.   I enjoyed being able to play for an hour or so and finish a map and come back the next day to play the next.If you are looking for a complex game, this is not for you.  But, if you are looking for something to quickly pickup and provide a couple dozen hours of casual gameplay then this might be your ticket.  Oh and I love the soundtrack.*UPDATE*The expansion Nevada Silver is good too.  Not quite as good as the base game, but it does add a bit and mixes things up a little.			"

Score = 8/10 (Pretty Good)1849 is a modern, casual take on the classic Sierra City Building games of yesteryear. I like the fact that it's casual and accessible since it's a perfect complement to more intense games that I tend to play in my library - a perfect game to wind down to. If you're a fan of the old Sierra City Building games like Zeus, Cleopatra, Caesar etc. and a purist (i.e. you like a bit of a challenge) you'll probably be disappointed with 1849 - it's also not a game for those who hate micromanagement since you'll be doing quite a lot of trading of resources to keep your town going (and abstaining from trading is not an option). If what I've described doesn't deter you though, I urge you to give the game a try.http://www.choicestgames.com/2017/01/1849-review.html "

												I really enjoyed this game. It was quick to beat though, and I am already wishing there were more campaign missions available because I really enjoyed the different challenges of each one. I played through both the base game and the DLC since purchasing a couple of days ago.It has a nice balance of puzzle management elements, and city building for each scenario. It was super fun trying to figure out the best balance of things and also which starting opportunity to pick for each.Again, my only lament is there are not enough scenarios to play through even with the DLC. I thoroughly enjoyed this not too brain exhausting little game, and will reply it again in the future.			"

												If you are looking for amazing graphics and in depth city building and management, then this is not the game for you. If you are looking for an easy building game that can pass some time then look no further. I personally enjoy this game, even though some things can be quite annoying like; not being able to move buildings once placed or rotate them, buildings that are half in and half out of fire department lines still burn down, being robbed even with a sherrif building with the zone, building degrading back to shack and plenty more but I won't write a book... The difficulty does increase the further you travel, so a good strategy is needed.All in all for the full price tag on this, I wouldn't recommend, but if you enjoy city building, regardless of the graphics and management system, then I would recommend grabbing this at a discounted price.

It does just what it promises.  If you are new to these type of games, I really recommend to start with this one.			"

												1849 is basically a miniture city-building game where each game is 10-25 minutes, perfect when you have a short time to burn.  The mechanics are not very deep but it works and you usually get to make meaningful choices during each game when you are given optional objectives which could be difficult but rewarding.Again if you are bored and want a city game, this 1849 is quick and stress-free but still provides decent challenge.

												This is the worst simulation I have ever played. It is literally more profitable to leave your citizens unemployed than to put them to work producing goods to sell. The only reasons to employ them at all are because too much unemployment causes crime and because you have to meet the completely arbitrary goals of the scenario. For example, there is a scenario where you're supposed to make and sell pickaxes, but according to my calculations, you actually take a net loss of over $12 per pickaxe! Is it too much to ask that the developers of an economic simulation do a little basic math?			"

Anyway good game, nice graphic and nice western music.You need to satisfy residents so they want to live in your city. More residents will pay more rent making you profit. From your earnings you build farm to produce wheat and bakery to transform wheat into bread - food for your residents. Also you can build cotton farms to produce cotton, you can build orchard to produce fruit which you will distil in distillery into brandy. You can sell cotton and brandy to other cities making your budget even more surplus to buy lumber.			"

												I have played a LOT of building games but 1849 is my absolute favorite! It can be difficult at times but is also a lot of fun! The many, many hours I spent beta testing this game are not reflected in the time here on Steam so don't pay any attention to my play time... on Steam it was just the time it took for me to get card drops in Sandbox mode since I had already completed the game during the beta testing.1849 is a constant balancing act of resources versus people versus buildings. Upgrade one and it could send something else out of whack. It's not a game to play for a few minutes and then move on to something else. It takes concentration, planning and strategy to finish each city. And the strategy includes building and road placements since it is possible to build everything just about anywhere.I was also able to beta test Nevada Silver but didn't like it as well as the original 1849. It was a lot more difficult and required a lot more planning to finish each city.Whether you opt for the original game or include the DLC, I think most people that enjoy building games will like 1849.

												I enjoyed this little game. Sure, it is not nearly as complex as city builders from the good ol' days. But considering this is a gaming genre that most studios seem to think is obsolete, I'm happy it's there. If you enjoy tweaking a microeconomy (production versus housing, trade, etc.) to the point that you're structurally swimming in dollars, this game is for you! Don't read too much into the bad reviews: these people are either unhappy with the restrictions some scenarios throw at you (which causes a higher difficulty later in the game, duh) or are just not that clever as city-builders. And did I mention this game has a western theme?! Does it get any better than that?! With the DLC it got me a solid 20+ gaming hours. But I did get a discount (<$10 for the two) so part of my positivity is derived from the bang for my buck :)			"

												1849 is a straightforward and simple little city builder set to the California gold rush era. The maps are quite small, however, so your ability to actually build is limited more by space than any other resource. The challenges put forward at each map tend to be either remarkably easy, or frustratingly difficult (unless you're replaying the map after learning what the scripted 'surprises' for that particular map is).I'd hesitate in calling this game 'deep' by any measure, and as a city builder/sim it is below par compared to titles two decades its senior - but at its price point it is decent value for your money; good enough for a short pass-time game, though you'll likely not return to it after you've beaten it once. 1849 also gets credit for a soothing (if repetitive) musical score, and for being reasonably easy to get 100% steam achievements with. Altogether, that's what makes me give this a thumbs up rather than down.If you consider buying this game, I recommend getting its Nevada DLC as well; it introduces more maps with the added complexity of railroad cars over coaches for your trading game, meaning a fair bit more planning ahead than the base game requires. If they're bundled on sale, they're worth picking up for a few evenings of 19th century city building.			"

												Purchased on sale, played through the entire campaign and one sandbox game. This game was well worth my investment given that I'm a fan of strategy/city builder games. The challenge is to find the sweet spot between population growth and building new structures which generates various goods. A few of these goods can then be sold via the market (providing you have paid to open a trade route), and this - along with rent - are the two mechanisms which allow you to earn money in order to buy needed supplies (again, via the market and trade routes), and grow your community. Each map limits you in a different way. Some, you won't be able to create your own lumber so you'll have to buy that from the market. Others, you may have to purchase food, etc. The key is to determine early on what you can produce and sell in abundance to generate cash. Ironically, about the worst thing you try to produce is gold or silver because the pace at which these commodities are produced is far too slow to generate much of an income. I think this is an area that could be better balanced.The building/trade/town growth are fun to establish and nurture along, and each map presents its own unique challenges throughout the campaign. Occasional bonus goals also come along which usually offer nice rewards if you can complete them - though they sometimes lead your original plan off course which can be both fun and frustrating. The down side, for me, was the interface. Not horrible, but there was no mechanism to set a ""sell when this item exceeds 100 units"" or ""buy when this item falls below 50 units"" kind of thing, which would negate the repetitive opening and closing of the trade window. Also, when you purchase items from the trade window, they show up immediately despite the fact that the horse and buggy representing the delivery of these items doesn't hit your trade depot for several seconds. This also happens with lines of production, where the worker icons seem to just be there for show as there is no delay from producing an item do delivery. But for a relatively casual game, this is a fairly solid purchase if you like time management and city building games. Overall, I give this game 7/10. "

There is a smidgen of strategy, and kids theoretically would love this, but the 1849 is so unremarkable from facebook and flash games, without having a hook, that the only way I could recommend this game would be the specific scenario that you are downloading it for your kid so that they can play a game that requires no internet connection. There is nothing wrong with the game, but there is nothing that I could recommend about it either.			"

												What a great little game.  For some time now I've been looking for a 'build/construct' type game and this fits the bill.  Easy to play, it seems too simplistic at first but before long becomes challenging.  Whilst not the most in-depth game there is plenty to kep you occupied, amused and challenged without getting frustrated.			"

												I originally bought this game before it was on steam so ignore the hours I've played.  I've put I'd say around another 10 hours in the game outside of steam.  I'm currently playing through the campaign again and I think this is a fun little city builder.  There are some different goals in each scenario and different ways to start each town depending on your playstyle.It can get a bit repetitive after a while but I think the same can be said for most city builders.  I enjoy it personally and would recommend it on sale.  I don't know that I would pay 14.99 for it, but on sale definitely.			"

												1849 is like a grown-up version of Sim Town set in the old west.It has simple gameplay mechanics, yet is still challenging, especially when it comes to completing commissions on time. The main story only takes about 15 hours to complete, but the game has good replay value if you're the type of gamer that likes to go back into beaten levels to try to complete tasks you couldn't before or try again with more challenging starter resources. The sandbox mode allows for further messing around too, but I can't figure out how to save a custom town before proceeding to a new one. It features some nice isometric artwork and a solid soundtrack that doesn't loop too quickly (although, the sound effects do sometimes get repetetive).I agree with other players on the point that it would be nice to have a feature that automates trading at a pace that you could customize, since micro-managing trades for resources that you need a constant supply of can become REALLY tedious. The Nevada DLC features a railroad trading system that automates trades, but the quantity traded cannot be customized, so it actually limits the size to which you can grow your town/city.			"

												A great little diversion of a game with many well-crafted levels to play, each with different objectives. The expansions paying tribute to the Nevada silver rush and the post-gold rush era make an excellent addition to the 1849-driven story. The core gameplay mechanic is basically just balancing population, who pays rent, with workplaces, which cost upkeep but keep people from committing crimes. It's not a terribly deep game and the maps are pretty basic, but each level in story mode differs in objective and modifiers and presents you a few interesting choices as to how you're going to play. It spends a good deal of time on non-mining economics as well: after all, it was the vintners, builders and saloon owners who truly made their fortune on the gold rush.			"

												This is easy to play and enjoyable city building game with different locations and aim to achieve. It is similar to the Caesar II family of games but a little simpler to handle and less frustrating. Likewise, it has a continuing story and also has a somewhat similar sense of humour. It is fairly easy and therefore doesn't take long to be rewarded. The only issues are 1) there are no instructions or tutorial and 2) it is not long enough (it took me 9 days). Overall, it is a very enjoyable and addictive game andwell worth its price. Highly recommended!Hint: On each map, there are always two requests made, and the reward for fulfilling these is mostly well worth it. It is even worth having a dry run, finding what the requests will be and then if necessary re-starting that particular map.			"

												1849 is a rewarding and surprisingly deep simulation. Designing the layout of the town from the ground up is exciting and intuitive. The art style is detailed, charming, and provides a refreshing amount of visual variety. The soundtrack makes for a very relaxing, almost meditative experience. It's an old-school sim in the vein of Rollercoaster Tycoon and Sim City (when it was good). Great fun to watch your town grow and achieve all the narrative goals.			"

												I had a lot of fun with this game! It felt challenging enough without being frustrating. Some of the gameplay mechanics were a bit off-putting at first since I have played a lot of games of this type, but once I figured out the gist of it I had a good time playing right through all 20 missions. The length of each mission felt just right for a good play session. It could use a few UI enhancements (namely automated buy/sell orders) but too much of this would trivialize the game. I can say there were several times I was glad the AI did not autobuy/sell as the further you get into a mission, the money you have on hand can fluctuate quite a bit!I have to add that while there are not many tracks, the music is top-notch. I caught myself humming it outside the game on more than one occasion.			"

												Unless you want your city building game to be very ""light"" in game play then I'd have to say don't bother with this game.  It's more of a puzzle game than any sort of real city building game.On the other hand if you enjoy this sort of puzzle game (i.e. what do I need to build to make houses grow up further AND as if not more importantly, in what order) then maybe you'd enjoy this.I can't however recommend this to any hardcore city building fan.  It took me all of 5 minutes to determine that so take it with a grain of salt.I thought it might be a lot more fun than it ultimately turned out for me.  Once you know the formula to grow your houses, then it's a simple matter of choosing what ""city"" on the map you want to play, then check the random list of items (once you start the city) of items you can buy and sell and then you know what to concentrate your efforts on to make money.  Some buildings end up costing you money (such as gold or silver mines) where as others like a house you'd collect rent from and make money.In the real world it makes no sense that your gold mine is not producing oodles of cash.  I believe the developers decided to try to balance things this way and it's just sort of strange for city building fans.However, the worst offense in this game would be the lack of management information.  Due to that a lot of things are left up to simply overproducing resources to avoid shortages and personally I don't find that fun.  I enjoy number crunching and this game doesn't leave me much room at all for that.Sorry, but it's a pass for me.			"

			1849 follows the tradition of the Anno series. Many consider this a fairly niche gaming market and with very few non-FPS options in the wild west we have to wonder whether this game lives up to the...		

1849 is a city builder in the spirt of Anno.  But it's not as complex or interesting as Anno.  It's the mobile version of the game and it's very very small feeling.  Save yourself the time and just purchase Anno 2070.  It's damn near the exact same game... just better.			"

												I tried this game again after deleting it last year. They've fixed it seems most of the bugs, but not all.If you like modding, forget it, none here.Their idea of a boundless map seems like a small map to me, I think on tiny you can only fit 2 buildings on it.All building are available at start. All buildings pretty much have the exact same 2 upgrade, 15% increase in production and +1-2 extra items per week. You can't tell which buildings need upgrades and which don't unless you click on each one. Also when you run out of iron ore, you get no message on it what so ever, since it's expensive to run, you have to be constantly clicking on the mine to find out if all the ore is gone.When selling resources, you can only sell 500 at a time. Then 500 again, and again. This really doesn't make sense to me, if I have 5k of wood to sell, why not just let me sell it all in one click?The most expensive item in game is pickaxes, which are needed to upgrade some building and run your iron mine (if there's iron on the map). The mines also use a lot of pickaxes. So you either have to buy them our you have to build a smelter to make iron and a blacksmith to make pickaxes, so this just turns into a vicious circle until you run out of iron. I never was able to make enough pickaxes to actually upgrade any building or to be able to sell any.You'll only need a couple of houses and everything else is industry, police, & fire.When you run out of needed items, there's no warning, all you'll see is people moving out and then you have to figure out why.On the plus side it's easy to make money. And if you run out, a mysterious family member gives you 500 more.This game is tedious and repetative. I completed some of the missions and did some sandbox play, but frankly it just gets boring after a while. All you're doing most of the time is clicking buildings to check upgrades and seeing what you have in your storehouse that has unlimited storage. Once you've built everything (and that doesn't take long on normal speed, last game it only took 2 hours) there's nothing else to do but start a new game.			"

												Recommend? Yes AND NoI think I expected a much more involved and enticing game which 1849 unfortunately didn't deliver. I noticed that, within the first 10 minutes of playing, that the game hasn't been made nearly as well as it could have been and it seems it was produced very quickly without too much attention to detail or fine tuning given, which, in my opinion, is very necessary in a city builder since that's the main focus. I do enjoy a cartoony approach but this is a little too simplistic for my taste - maybe I've been spoilt with the likes of Anno or Cities Skylines, but in my opinion the classic Pharoah and Caesar titles from Sierra were much more enjoyable than this which is very sad as I'd love to play a good city builder set in this time period. My review isn't totally negative and I think the word 'No' in recommendation is too harsh, but a 'yes' is also not accurate. I would say that the game would be quite nice for city builder newbies as it doesn't throw too much micromanagement chaos at you at once, and is a good introduction as to how games like Banished, Anno, Cities etc work, but on a much simple scale. I'd recommend the game if you're new to city builders or just looking for a fun littleg game to keep you busy for about 30 minutes at a time but for city builder veterans I think you'd be disappointed, especially if you take the price into consideration.

												Throw back... Its 1849 and California is apart of a major gold rush! Your not really a mayor seeing as you govern most of the Cali cities but its okay.Basically its a tycoon game where you build towns to help a thriving gold rush age...OKAY HOLD IT! Real talk: Back in the gold rush people killed each other for gold, there where a lot of go-go girls, gambling, gangs, and shotouts. Thats not what I want in the game thats a history lesson from me to you. You just read a reveiw that educated you, thats a first.Moving on, if you like cute little kid tycoon fake disrespectful history games then this is for you... But if you do then there certianly ain't enough room in this town for the two of us.Lastly this game has possibly been dropped. It hasn't been updated in awhile so you'll be getting the game as it is.			"

												I really enjoy this game, it's addictive in a strange, perfectionist, control-freak sort of way. I love city builders but was looking for some a little more simple than a huge sim-city type deal and without the combat that other strategy games have.

As far as suggestions may go, I was hoping for a little more financial control, rather than really just balancing the wage-rent ratio.

												Though I liked the concept, it somehow feels unfinished...Expanding your town (which can be very expensive) leads to people settling in.If you don't provide room for them to build houses, they start building plots somewhere which you can't destroy.If you don't provide resources for them to upgrade their housesthey are probably going to move out again. But they don't just move out, they also take their stuff with them, so any upgrades done already will be dismantled and the resources are gone.If you don't provide enough jobs, they are probably moving out too.. The problem is. Building workplaces is very expensive. Sometimes you can't even come to a positive outcome, let me demonstrate this with a bit of math:Running a Bakery costs 50 $ / week and provides 4 workplaces. So each of these 4 workers cost you 12,5 $ / week. Plus you have to pay 300 $ to build the Bakery in the first place.Running a Goldmine costs 100 $ / week for 10 workers. So each one costs you 10 $ / week.A medium Townhouse with 19 residents brings you 115 $ income / week, that is ~6 $ income / week per citizen.In my games, I was always very close to bankruptcy, gladly, there are financial aids that save you once with a 500 $ cash injection. It took me some time to realize how essential trading is to succeed in a game. However, the trading system is a bit unhandy. You first have to form a traderoute, which can cost you up to 300 $, but then you can't set up automatic trades, you basically have to wait for your workers to mine for gold, and sell it yourself.Altogether, my games have been very brief, as I had to stay in a constant expansion to provide enough jobs and get the resources my workers needed to upgrade their homes (so they pay higher rents, which, however, wasn't enough either). And the constant expansion plus selling your stuff plus buying the stuff your villagers need - but you can't provide because you sadly don't have any lumber in this area - may take all your concentration, because there aren't really any tools to support you. Though I can imagine that the gold rush in California actually caused very rapid growth, it seemed kinda odd that I can't even build a single stable situation where I provide jobs, food, and houses and have a positive revenue...It was fun playing, but as I said, it feels kinda.. unfinished.

												I played this until completion of the main scenario and so that has to be taken into account while reading what comes later. It certainly had me compelled to keep playing in a way that something really bad wouldn't. I've always wanted something like this with a Western setting though. I'm a sucker for it. Also, Humble Bundle. I'm a sucker for that too. This was in one recentlyAnyway,All of the gameplay systems in this are either lifted from Tropico or the Anno series. It's like a cross between the two but not as good as either. And I know that those two examples will have had bigger teams and a bigger budget etc but that doesn't change the fact that 1849, while being decent enough, just doesn't have the style, grace, design or AI that those games do. I don't want to be harsh on it as like I said, I did complete it, and I'll always assume that the people developing things like this are trying their hardest, but when I saw that it costs £10.99 on Steam I was astounded. There is no way anybody should pay that much for this game in this day and age. Seriously. No way. It's not good enough or clever enoughAlmost anyone other than a resurrected John Wayne would be better off just getting the previously mentioned Tropico or Anno. You wouldn't miss anything by not playing this. Saying that though, I DID COMPLETE IT and if you're easily susceptible to getting sucked into this genre, in an almost hypnotic trance, then it's alright, just dont ever spend £10.99 on it. Wait for a sale. Sorry devs, but it's just a harsh reality that better games are available at better prices and you have to take that into account when pricing your own game.Actually. You know what?

												RTS city builder based on the Gold Rush. Kind of short, and feels like a browser game, with a disappointing sandbox.Edit: the sandbox is much more thought out and balanced now. I was just able to build a city with 1000 population. I would kill for some ranches on that specific map, though! Oh well. The campaign is fun for a playthrough or two. The Nevada Silver DLC also adds a fair amount of content. The pace can get rather fast towards the end! Pretty fun overall.			"

												If you like the Sierra city-building games of the past (like the Caesar series and such), or even if you're new to this, then you'd probably like this game too, if you could tolerate some of its flaws. I am hoping that by posting this, they could address and fix said flaws.First, the lack of multiple placement and demolish. Every time you want to place a house (or whatever), you have to click on that gold button on the lower right. You can't just place multiple buildings. You can't drag-and-place. This becomes an issue when you want to prevent homeless people from placing tents all over your empty lands by placing ""doodads"" on the vacant lots. Imagine using multiple clicks to place over 20 doodads, one by one. It gets frustrating. When deleting a building, you have to click on each building, then delete them - it's a 2-step process. You can't just select something once, then delete multiple buildings. Also, you can't drag-and-delete.Second, UI issues. You can't resize them. Also, certain UI elements pop out when you're placing certain buildings, which can interfere with placement. Sherrif and similar buildings do that.Another one is trading. It could be a chore. You can't set up something that will allow you to get or sell a resource automatically and to a certain amount automatically. It's all manual. For example, I can't import and maintain 500 lumber automatically, and I can't also export boards until I only have 500 left automatically. Because of this, you always have to monitor resources you need that you import and and export, then do it all manually, with many clicks.These are just a few things that could be deal-breakers for some people. To sum it up, I still recommend the game (I'm still playing it, despite the flaws), but if you do not like all (or any) of what I mentioned, then this game might not be for you. You have to be very patient with this game.			"

												1849 is a pretty basic economic game where you need to get the money flowing into your bank account by selling goods or by collecting the rent. Once you detect which is the key product to sell on each scenario you just have to set the production chain and wait for the goal to be accomplished. If you also pay attention to your citizens and provide them with the goods they need then your income will significantly increase making the scenario even shorter.If you want a casual management game to play a 20 minutes scenario from time to time then it's ok. That is everything you will get.			"

												I enjoyed the game, its not much of a city building game but was fun. The first few levels were really easy and I started to get worried, but it ramps up the difficulty as you progress. Once you figure out what to do to beat a level, you can quickly exploit that to get money to win that city.I enjoyed how every city was different, enjoyed it enough to spent 15 hours to beat the scenarios. A lot of the game is constantly managing inventory, keeping raw materials in stock, selling finished. Its got very tedious and made me wish for a way to unlock a way to automatically manage my inventory. Some of the scenario are quick, which I love because I could start and finish a city and not get overly involved before I ran out of time.All in all, a fun little game I'd recommend.			"
