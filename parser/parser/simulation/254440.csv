												Sometimes, you need a game that's frenetic, fast paced and full of chaos.  You need some escapism so you get away from the humdrum of your day job by pretending to be some beefcake named Slab Rockhard blast some bugs to bits with your AK - 22.  Other times though, you need to come home, kick back, crack a brewski and chill out.  Take it easy, shoot some pool like a pro and relax.  That's what you have Pool Nation for.  It's zero pressure, it's zero chaos. It's 100% cool, daddy-o.  It's got some great physics too, so you can shoot pool and feel like a king. Because some times, you need to come home and pretend that you're a slick mo-fo pool shark.  Because if you tried to play pool in the real world, people would realize you're a 40 year old dork in dad jeans try his damnedest to look cool. I uh...that may have gotten too personal. "

												Pool Nation isn't a perfect pool game, but it's a huge step up from what's come before. If you're not already a billiards fan, Pool Nation won't make you one. Conversely, for those dying to scratch the billiards itch, Pool Nation is sure to satisfy. An entertaining, highly varied and technically excellent pool game, even if lacking in innovation or new elements for its genre.With Pool Nation you'll get a pooling experience that you've never had before. The simulator delivers several game modes and a lot of options to choose from. Every kind of shot that you can imagine is possible to make in the game and because of that you can truly speak of a great simulator. Another big plus are the graphics, which are truly stunning for a low budget title. Overall, Cherry Pop Games's first endeavour has left us with a fantastic billiards game featuring stunning visuals, great audio and even better physics. The lengthy, albeit difficult career mode, will give you plenty of play time but perhaps for the wrong reasons. If you're looking for a realistic, stylish, and fun billiards game, Pool Nation is the cream of the crop.			"

												Pool Nation is one of my favorite games on Steam. The solid gameplay and controls were not enough for Cherry Pop Games, they went ahead and added some beautiful locations each offered during day, sunset, and neon lit night time. The amazing soundtrack gets you in the mood whether you want to relax or get pumped. The game modes for single player include 3ball, 8ball, 9ball, endurance, golf, killer, rotation, speed, and straight. In addition, you can play online versus friends in a friendly match or choose to be competitive in tournament mode. The most recent update includes ""box of tricks"" free of charge, allowing you to create a custom trick shot that you can share with the world. This game is the complete package.			"

												Pool Nation is a great pool simulator that will make you feel like a hustler once you master all the different trick shots. Lots of different game modes like 9-ball, 8-ball, endurance, and tournaments. Plus you can play online versus friends. The game offers good graphics, although they can be a little bit on the shiny side. The cue control system is mostly user friendly even though sometimes it can feel like a chore to set up a trick shot just right. Straight shots are extremely intuitive and the angle assistance makes it really easy to sink shots. Although bank shots and combos aren't so straightforward.This is the first real pool game that I have played on the PC and quite frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it was the last. I just don't know how it can get any better. The game trailers and screenshots really sold me before my purchase and the game certainly has not disappointed--really well done. The only blemish is that it occassionally crashes.			"

												One of the best pool sim to come along since the Virtual pool series.  The developers are a small group working out of Manchester, England and they do a whale of a job listening to their players.  They frequent all of the forum and community hub sites and update when needed.  They really do care about their product and want to make it the best sim on the market and to my opinion they have succeeded.  This game is a really ""must have"" for the serious and not so serious pool gamer.  Cheap and twice the price but well worth looking into...buy this game!			"

 “8-Ball - Corner Pocket” ‘Pool Nation’ is a fun, polished Billiards simulator and a bargain at its $1 pricetag (Steam Fall Sale 2014). Released as the maiden offering from Cherry Pop Games, it’s gorgeous visuals, multiple game modes, lengthy campaign and lots of unlockables will keep Pool fans coming back for more.   Campaign | Gameplay: Gamers have the choice of playing standard 8-ball or variations like 9-ball, Rotation, Endurance, Sudden Death etc across a variety of visually stunning locations / pool halls. A lengthy campaign mode (against AI opponents) allows you to perfect your game and strive toward numerous unlockables including new locations, pool table decals, new ball styles and cue styles. Additionally, the online mode allows you to match up with friends or other online players in single matches, Tournaments or King of the Hill events. Multiple difficulty levels (from Novice to Pro), a spot on physics engine, responsive controls, and a great soundtrack make this the best Pool game to date.Flaws: In considering its biggest issues – 1. Game Stability is poor (Tabbing to windows results in an insta-crash) and 2. Online Gaming is largely dead (Bring your own friends). Additionally, the developers have pushed the previously promised ‘Trick Shot’ mode to the next release, and the lack of Co-op play is disappointing as well.Overall, ‘Pool Nation’ is the best conception of a Billiards game to date and fans of the real game will find this a fun, polished distraction. But, even ardent fans soon realize that Pool without the smoky basement rooms, uneven cues, pitchers of beer, chatty girls, side-bets and bar-room trash talk, is a somewhat hollow experience.

												I remember a few months ago when it was on sale and i thought it would be one of those games that i buy and dont even play, And even when it was only a few euros, i didnt buy it!I was wrong....My boyfriend remembered that moment too and he recently gifted me the game.We've been playing it A LOT ever since.The game looks absolutely stunning! There is so much detail in this game.The controlles are easy to use, Its easy for beginners but you can make it more challenging for yourself if you want too, when your getting better. There are so many options in this game which makes it an awesome pool game for everybody. Yes, Also when you dont know anything about pooling lol. In single mode you can unlock different Rooms, Balls, Tables and so much more.Which is cool because you can make it totally as you want it to look, also online against your friends.That brings me too the  biggest plus of this game... The multi player option!Playing against others works great, but the sad part is that not many people play this game which makes it not so easy to find people to play a match with.So if you want to play it online i recommend that you find a friend on your friendlist to play it with.This game which i thought would get boring quickly turned out to be really addictive and extremely fun.Its even THAT good that i write a review for it and thats something that i rarely do.Its a must have, And since its on sale again at this moment i would say its worth to give it a try. You'll be amazed, I promise ;]			"

												A fantastic pool simulator. Frustratingly accurate! Turn off the assists for a proper experience but I warn you... It is frustratingly addictive. The A.I opponents will make quick work of you for making small errors in the later tournaments but it certainly isn't unfair. Just like real pool sometimes you will let your shot go & know you have messed up as soon as the cue touches the whiteball.			"

												Best pool simulator on steam.I really enjoy pool games like the miniclip's 8 ball pool I have on my phone and computer. This game is really awesome cause it even has workshop for special tracks you can make for balls as you unlock more stuff winning games in singleplayer. Truly an amazing game. And if you like taking screenshots, this might be the game for you aswell. You can take some really nice screenshots during through the campaign in singleplayer. The graphics are truly amazing.And even multiplayer? Woah! This is too cool to be thruth! All this needs now is local co-op versus mode.-={You can buy this game for 1$ on ♥♥♥. Its safe, I bought it there.}=-Pros: +Much custumization +Awesome graphics +No lag +Multiplayer +Trading cards +Full and good controller support +Workshop +Tricks/Stunts +Much to do. +No time limit while you choose which ball to hit and the angle.Cons: -Sometimes it bugs out. (For me - once it bugged out menu screen. Not a big problem) -If you play with mouse it might not be so good. I recommend controller.9/10			"

												This is one of the best pool games i have seen. Graphics look nice, the physics are good and it's pretty fun. A strange thing is the uncomfortable mouse controls, but i played with a xbox controller, what works very well.But now: Devs abandonned this game. They promised a snooker mode. There is none. They took ages to get the update for the trickshot mode which is basically a lure into buying dlc. This mode is also unpolished, as there was never an update again. And it should have been in the game for release. Well that's ok, i rather wait, than having an unfinished mode. Still no update or the promised snooker mode. Yeah bla bla small dev team...but:There is no reaction of the devs anymore in the forums. So they are planning on bringing a new game (which already is out on xbox) to pc, that is (at least in my opinion) what this game should have been and what we all paid for. But wait, it will cost you extra as it is a standalone game. The fact, that they promised the owners of this game an ""upgrade"" discount does not make it any better. So i say:Do NOT buy this!Such a dev team is not worth your hard earned money. And as there might be the ""real"" version of this game out, this is worth waiting for if you really want it. Might just take another year or so...			"

												An excellent pool simulator with great physics and excellent controls (both M+WASD and gamepad work very well). It has an extensive career mode, free mode, fun challenges with unusual game types, tournaments, and online multi-player mode. Pool Nation is gorgeous - right down the the details in the fabric. The only negative in presentation is that your opponents are disembodied as are you; no physical presentation of the players in the game. There are also no spectators. You play in these gorgeous modern venues with seating for dozens or even hundreds, but they are entirely empty.As someone who has had a slate pool table in my home for most of my life, I find this a compelling simulation and well worth the few dollars of the asking price.

AUDIOElectronicaVISUALDazzlingDIFFICULTYSharp Learning CurveVIBEChillCRAVINGBilliardsON SALEDiscountedPROS: Solid pool simulator with reasonably-dependable multiplayer. Fun single-player tournament mode. Game has a fair amount of complexity not offered in other similar games allowing players to pull off cool shots. CONS: Game has the tendency to occasionally glitch out. Planned features appear to be on an indefinite hiatus, and much-needed updates haven't happened. A bit tough to get a more advanced grasp on the controls. A lot of balls will fly off the table before you get a good feel for what will happen.WORTH: With how badly Pool Nation is beginning to fall apart and how sparingly things get addressed, I'd say wait for a sale. The developer has switched focus to other projects, so I wouldn't hold my breath for this version to come to full fruition.OVERALL: A fun game to share with friends, and it goes on sale for 1.00-2.00USD rather often. The game seems to have an active community, though it has been hard for me personally to get in touch with players I've reached out to. Hoping to see more updates.SCORE:7/10                                                                     Full Review Coming Soon "

												Right off the bat, one thing that will catch your attention is the variety of game types.  Most billiards games like to focus only on either 8- or 9-ball.  Those games are here, but they do not stop at that.  Along the game, other games like Rotation and Golf are in the mix.  With nine different ways currently available with Snooker and Trick coming soon, there are plenty of ways to play.Another strong point about the game is the controls.  Like in any other pool game, being able to control the cue ball is important.  Most games simply allow you to aim the ball and adjust the power.  Even though most games stop at this, there are more options to offer.  By being able to adjust the angle of the cue stick as well as where on the cue ball to aim, it gives the option of doing jump and swerve shots, something most billiard games leave out.  Additionally, with a full tutorial teaching how to do all of these moves, it does not take long before they become second nature.Beyond all the gameplay details, a nice touch about the game is the amount of customization available.  Even games that try to simulate pro billiards tend to stick to a single, sometimes sponsored look throughout the game.  This one goes beyond the basics.  As soon as you start a game, the highly detailed and moving locals make it feel like you are in what could be a real location.  As you keep progressing, at least a dozen locals, cue sticks, ball sets, and even table decals make it that regardless your taste, there is plenty to see even from a visual standpoint.Once the single-player game is over, there is still more to play.  Through online multiplayer, it is possible to keep playing with others.  It is even possible to create tournaments to learn who the best player is.  However, the one drawback is that there is no local multiplayer mode available.  This means that in order to play with another person in the same room, the two of you must play through a network.  This feels like a major oversight.  A simple hot seat patch would have made that the game could be a great party game.  Even without local multiplayer, this is still a great package that any billiards fan can easily enjoy.			"

												Pool Nation is a suprisingly good game. However annoying and cliche the music is it surpasses quite alot of the ♥♥♥♥ on steam. The gameplay works well. Physics are very good and accurate. Visually it is amazing and is an all round enjoyable game. You can play with a friend and having a nice game of pool. Are take a tournament by storm and listen to some tunes while your at it. I never thought I would buy a pool game but for £1.04 it was so worth it. It is definetely worth even £7. I recommend giving this game a go. Although it may not be a game you spend hours upon hours playing it is for sure a game worth getting.

												The difficulties I have with Pool Nation start in the fact that I already know ho to play pool. I will explain: The english in Pool Nation does not accurately represent the way in which a ball would travel with said spin. Top and bottom english when making a cut shot can cause the cue ball to travel more left or right on the deflection, and this is not represented at all.Left/right english isn't actually as useful on a pool table as an amateur might think. I rarely use left/right english in real pool, as top/bottom english can account for most necessary ball control.As I can best explain it: Top and bottom english account most for how the cue ball deflects off the object ball, and left/right english effects the way the cue ball deflects off rails. There is a small amount of effect with left/right on ball deflection, and top/bottom on rail deflection, but it is very slight.This has to do with the fact that the rail is a solid unmovable force, and ball deflection is sympathetic to mass/friction.My previous pool experience makes this game very unintuitive!

												Hands down the best Pool game out there. Beautiful textures, great physics and enough variation in games to keep you busy for a while. Best of all it runs great on my old-as-dirt PC.Multiplayer is a blast, especially if you can get a group together for a tournament. The free roaming camera allows for amazingly framed shots when you are brodcasting the game. Your spectators won't get bored!Multiple levels of difficulty are present, and should gbe used if you are looking for a challenge. The novice mode is only good for the first few rounds, as it reveals quite a bit of the ball paths. My only complaint here is that champion mode perhaps reveals too much as well (Cue ball only).Tricks shots are a blast to pull of and never get old. Experimenting with angles and english prove to be highly satisfying. Especially when you pot the winning shot with a knifes edge. Looking forward to the new mode: Box of Tricks, and maybe Trading cards? (wink wink).			"

												I don't really try to take this game too seriously. I mostly play it when I need to think or if I'm planning a grocery list.But in all seriousness, it has decent ball physics and there's a true to life satisfaction when sinking the balls in order and never sinking the cue ball.

												I play pool in real life and I must say, the physics are just as awesome as the visuals. However, the developers seem to only care about money. Just read the reviews on Pool Nation FX and you'll understand. Promised tons of great things with this game, only to drop it and make the same game with a new title. You had something great on your hands, CP, and you b**** slapped us all with it, then threw away the glove. If you have friends to play this with then it's totally worth it but that's about it, since no one plays this online anymore.			"

												Pool Nation is one of the most polished indie games of 2013- the animations are shiny and smooth, the gameplay is responsive and the physics are realistic. You won't find yourself screaming at this game for bouncing your balls in the wrong direction, or glitching out and dropping your cue ball through the table. With eleven game modes including tournaments, online play, and single-player endurance mode; as well as a slew of collectables to unlock, Pool Nation has no shortage of goodies to keep gameplay fresh.The single player component revolves primarily around tournaments where you take on AI challengers of ever increasing difficulty. Each match has an associated list of challenges, and completing them unlocks a variety of cosmetic changes like cues and balls. Standard games like 9 ball are present along with more interesting options like Golf, which challenges you to put specific balls into specific pockets. There’s also a time attack style mode, where balls spawn on the table and you have to sink as many as possible in the time limit. There are Free Play, Versus, and Online modes present too, but I had a hard time finding anyone to challenge online.Pool Nation is a great looking game that features bright and shiny graphics that makes each game, literally, feel new and different. There are some good themes on the game's soundtrack, and though the game's controls look difficult to use, they aren't difficult to learn. There are also options that can be easily turned on or off to give players assists in a game including arrows that point at the next balls that need to be hit or arrows that show where a ball will travel when hit. All of these features combine to make an excellent presentation for Pool Nation. But is it fun? In short stints I definitely enjoyed playing the game, but it isn’t the type of thing I’d want to play for hours at a time. Having said that, I think Pool Nation is the kind of experience that would be a hit at a house party. If you’ve been searching far and wide for a Billiards simulator, and don’t have room for an actual table, Pool Nation is probably the solution. The physics are solid, the controls allow for extreme fine tuning of shots, and everything looks super shiny. A few more game types would be welcome, but for $10 Pool Nation is the gold standard in the category.

												- All Racked Up -I quite enjoy Pool Nation.I find something soothing about it.Of course, I'm an avowed novice (I just loves my crutches), who would rather chat and play, in a more languid sorta way, than be champ. (Though, if by some miracle, I were to become champ, it would be sooo cool.)I mean, there's something very gratifying about being on a 6 ball streak, while carrying on a casual conversation, with friends, about the stupid decisions the characters on Walking Dead make.But, play on any other setting and I'd have to put on my ugly old game face and actually concentrate on each shot, and...well, I don't wanna.Oh yeah, I've also recently discovered that it's a wonderful little comedown after a long hard evening of pulling ""overkill"" jobs in Pay Day 2, as well.However...On the other hand, the game can be a bit glitchy.Like, it won't let me exit.  It asks me if I would like to exit, I say yes, and then it just sits there blankly looking at me.I almost always have to close it via task manager.Even worse, there was a point, early on, where it would just shut down and chuck me onto my desktop.  Once, it actually crashed as I was hitting the 8 ball in for a win.Thank goodness, that seems to have stopped, though the exit problem still persists. It's a minor glitch, which alone, will certainly not stop me from playing.I mean, it would be nice if they'd fix it... but, honestly, in my mind, task manager has pretty much become the default mode of exit now, anyway.Note: I bought this during a Steam sale for less than half the regular price.  A fact that  has, of course, influenced this rating. "

												Pick up and play pool fun with beautiful detail throughout! I have been looking for a good pool game for years, being a long time fan of the very early ""Yahoo Pool"" (was the only thing I did with Yahoo) I have been hunting ever since. This game retails for $9.99 but I got it for the week long sale for $1.49, I feel it's easily worth the retail price. If you are a fan of pool, and are looking for a legit game to play with friends, make sure you all buy this one, then let me know so we can play together!UPDATE: 7-29-14 I had some questions and suggestions for this game so I popped into the community hub to ask them. I wanted a lobby system where people could link up and pick rooms, and servers to play in with friends. I wanted it more social (like old yahoo pool) where you could have many people watching, chatting in the chat box and getting ready to play winner. Well, after asking the question I heard back from the developers. They in fact are working on a new pool game where these features will be featured. They are re creating a pool game engine from the ground up to allow these features. I am excited for THAT game!			"

												Hey guys, thanks for reading my reviews. Let me make this as plain as possible. If you like pool and can find this cheap, check it out. It's not bad at all. I think the controls are better here in many ways than I've seen in previous PC pool games, but what's the game really like? You get nine ball, eight ball, and a few mini-games. There is a trick mode that hasn't been put into the game yet apparently. The humor is painful mostly, but not always bad. Just never very clever or subtle.As for the negative stuff: I think it gets repetitious. It's also buggy. I don't like the AI at all, as it sometimes seems too transparent what's happening in the game. Some of the rounds a really good AI player will goof several times in a row to give me a chance to beat it. Other times it feels like it's cheating to win.  Sometimes the match challenges don't appear to count properly or are too literally applied, and it seems inconsistant with its application of what meets the requirements of a given challenge. For example, I played a match that wanted me to get a 3 ball streak with a jump shot. I got a 4 ball streak with a jump at the end and it didn't count it. The next time I played, it seemed to count it. So I just don't trust the AI at all. Also, some of the designer ball sets that you can unlock confuse me visually because the stripes and solids look too similar to me from a distance. The settings are very colorful, which isn't necessarily bad, but can be VERY loud. Anyway, even though this seems a negative review, it's not meant to be. The devs say they are working to improve it, and if they do I think it has a lot of potential. As it is, if you can get it for a very low price and you like pool, try it. I've enjoyed playing it, but it can be frustrating at times.			"

												Excellent game for a variety of reasons. I like the attention that was put into the details. Everything looks really nice, there are quirky opponents, and most importantly the gameplay is excellent.There are two campaigns: one for 8-ball and one for 9-ball. Both have challenges each match to help keep the game fresh. Some example challenges are complete a trick shot or have a streak of potted balls. Their are also a variety of opponents with little biographies that you can choose to read or not. It is nice how this game is not too story dependent as I feel that would interrupt the flow. Each campaign takes a while to get through and was fun for me until completion.Another mode I've spent time on is endurance mode. It is an addicting, time sensitive, mode in which you try to continuosly pot balls while new balls are being added at increasingly fast intervals. I've spent at least an hour just with that mode, chasing a new time record.The variety of modes is very extensive. There are also one off matches with a variety of rule sets as well as online multiplayer. It is hard to jump right into a match sometimes due to lack of online opponents but there are plenty of small groups on Steam dedicated to tournaments and matchmaking.Additionally, throughut all the modes, you can choose whether to play with an auto aimer on or off to toggle the difficulty.The upcoming free update Box of Tricks looks super neat as well. I'm sure it will further increase the replayability of this game.Overall, for the low price this game is a must buy.			"

TL;DRA solid arcadey pool game with a variety of modes. Despite the small playerbase and no previously promised snooker mode, I recommend it to any fool pan pool fan, especially on sale.+ User-friendly mechanics+ Gorgeous graphics and flashy gameplay (jump shots, swerve shots, etc.)+ A variety of gamemodes (honourable mention: endurance mode)+ Witty descriptions+ Fitting soundtrack+ Fair AI+ Lots of cues, decals, and ball sets- Small playerbase- No promised snooker mode- Minor bugsREVIEWPool Nation is an arcadey pool simulation game. This one takes the player to the world of fancy lounges, chillout music, and jump shots.The game is very accessible: tutorials are short but cover important basics to get one started. One can also adjust the aiming aid level (novice -> veteran -> pro -> champion -> off) which is a huge plus. Players can test their skills against the AI opponents in VS and Career modes, as well as against other people, and solo in the Endurance mode. The last mode is a time trial and requires quick thinking and precise shots, as the balls spawn faster as the time goes by and when the ball count on the table reaches 24, the game is over.The career mode is divided into two tournaments (9-ball and 8-ball), each with four cups. There are 12 matches in each cup plus a couple of bonus matches in lesser known modes, such as killer, 3-ball, speed pool, and the like. Each of the matches has two optional challenges to complete, for instance finishing a match with a skill shot, a ball streak, etc. Completing certain matches unlocks cosmetics. There are loads of decals, cues, and ball sets to be earned and the only problem is that they seem to reset to default ones every time the game is started. It is a minor issue but worth mentioning nonetheless.This game looks and sounds great. The sounds of cue action combined with jazzy muzaks in the background create a laid-back atmosphere. Sit back, take the weight off your shoulders, and pot the balls like a boss – this game lets one do just that. Furthermore, the AI is fair for the most part and the difficulty curve is not very steep, making the experience very pleasant and virtually rage-free.Overall, I recommend getting this game on sale to any fan of billiards games. While it may not be a realistic simulation and its playerbase may be really small, this game can provide hours of entertainment and satisfy the itch for some pool action. It indeed is a shame that the snooker mode was not delivered, given how much fun this game is.P.S.

												If you like pool, this is your best (and only) option on steam. It looks great and sounds great technically and stylistically. There are nearly no loading times after you start the game, making beginning and playing games as fast as you want it to be. For playing pool itself, there are lots of easy to use but hard to master options for doing more tricky shots. Curve balls, jump balls, bank balls. It's all there and can be executed with serious precision. Even when you knock a ball clean off the table, the satisfying crunch on the floor makes a failed shot sound so sweet.There's really not much that can be done to improve this game. The only trouble I've had with this game is using the replay function and the online multiplayer isn't very active, but the core game is as solid as an 8-ball. If you have any interest in video game pool, this is as good as it gets.			"

												Pool Nation delivers a solid billiards simulation experience.  It makes the grade in the areas critical to this type of game:  the physics are sound,the shot-making is clean, and there's enough variety in the game types to keep things fresh for a while.  On top of that, the game is downright beautiful.There are some flaws, but nothing game-breaking.  The most glaring (for me, anyway) was that the game feels literally empty.  When shooting, you're shooting in a seemingly deserted hall.  There's no crowd, no opponent squirming in the chair as you knock the balls down.  Speaking of your opponents, while their descriptions are modestly humorous, there's little to differentiate them from one to the next.  At times it feels a bit sterile.  Again, this isn't really game-breaking.  But part of the allure of playing at the bar or hall is the atmosphere, and the game is lacking in that regard.All in all, though, the plusses outweigh the minuses.  If you're a billiards enthusiast, this game is just about value for money at full price and a bargain if you can pick it up on sale.			"

Luckily, I got the discount item from one of my badge sets and was able to buy this game for $1.00. It is the best dollar I have ever spent in my life. The physics is amazing and gameplay is very smooth. I tried out ""endurance"" first and before I realized it, a few hours went by >_>As much as I enjoy this game so, I cannot recommend getting this game at full price because that would be hypocritical.. I do not buy games unless they are on sale :DThis game has online matches/tournaments, but I have not tried it yet.. Too busy jump, curve, kick shooting from across the table.tl;dI got this game for $1.00Best billards game I have ever played (I don't know if that is saying much from what I've had experience with).If you have any interest in pool table I would highly recommend this game.Has online matches and tournaments.Incredible trick shots.Rating 9.5/10 (+2 Price, +3 Great Game, +2 Replayability, +1 Simple controls, +0.5 Smooth game (crashes if you try to change windows while fullscreen. don't know if its just me.

												This game is really well made. Very realistic physics (despite the tricks I can do here, I could never do in real life). I have had no issues or problems playing the game. Single player - at time has been tough to get all the stars as I slowly make my way through it. Toughest is the time limit for me to pot all balls and 8 ball last - but fun just the same.Multiplayer - a bunch of us had a tournament (double elimination) for the game. It was a lot of fun. We even twitched games for each other to see and our subscribers/groups to view. It was a lot of fun. It because though noticeable with flow kb/m v controller.I think this is probably the best pool PC game I have played. It is well done and I highly recommend. I plan on continuing to work my way through single player and play against friends when I can.I recommend this game. "

												This game is not bad but AGAIN it got abandonned by Cherry Pop. Abandoning their games not long after launch is a trademark from this joke of a dev team. Stealing money is also their trademark and they are now recognised just for this. Avoid this game at all cost unless you plan to play alone or against the stupid AI.			"

												This game is just brilliant. If you're looking for a highly realistic pool simulator, look elsewhere. If you're looking for a reasonably realistic pool sim with awesome trick shot potential, you've found it and believe me, jumping the cue ball in slow motion, over your opponents blockade and potting your own ball in the process is completely badass.I love it.

												First off, this is the best looking pool game I have ever played.  Period.Beautiful pool tables, balls, and environments that are fully fleshed out and animated to give you a real sense of immersion.The game is full of details that kept surprising me.  Some of them are so subtle that you can't even notice it unless you are watching the replay.  Here are a few things you will find:* 3rd dimension: this isn't a simple pool game where balls stick to the table.  All pool balls can be knocked off, up in the air, and over other balls (given enough force).* When hit certain ways, chalk will fall off stick and sprinkle on the table.* Tiny woven texture on table material when you zoom in close* Sides of table (bumpers) actually give and bend in when a ball hits them with force (very hard to notice without replay!)For single player there is enough to keep you busy for awhile with tournaments in various game types against different AI.  One thing I found keeping my interest is bonuses you can try for on each game in a tournament.  For instance one might have a bonus for pulling off a jump shot during the match.  You can still win the game, but there will be a bonus for doing the jump shot.  Earning these stars while winning makes for a fun challenge.There are also many ball styles, cue sticks, and locations to unlock through single player.  So far every ball set I have unlocked has been great looking and is a good incentive to keep playing and unlock more.For multiplayer, it is fully functional in both same computer and online play.  Unsurprisingly you have to wait awhile for a game to show up, but that's less the fault of the game and more of the popularity of online pool :).Last I should go over the physics.  This is a tough point to argue because so many factors go into pool physics and without a doubt there is no game out there that is 100% accurate.  If you have ever seen a ball hit another ball at high speed in close up slow motion you'll see what I mean.  Not to mention there are many different ball sizes/weight, table materials and cue sticks used in different areas that add to the difficulty in comparing this to the real world.All I can say for sure is the physics seem real and have been really fun.  Added to the ability to hit the ball just where I want at power levels I never could in RL the game makes you feel like a pool master.Game is on sale for $1.99 currently.  Sell a couple summer trading cards and pick it up!			"

												The TL;DR: Amazing Pool game for both veterans and beginners. With many game modes(rule sets) and Free Play, local and online multiplayer, and several things to aid beginners, such as aim assist, an interactive tutorial to teach trick shots, and to always have the controls listed on the side of the screen. This, of course, can all be turned off.Great pool game! The main game modes in single player seem to be 8 and 9 Ball Tour Modes, where you play that ruleset against increasingly difficult AI opponents, who have humorous Bios. However they have other game modes/rule sets as Bonus Matches in the tour. Each opponent has 3 Stars you can collect as an added challenge, which can be completed for extra replayability. You get the first star simply by beating the opponent, which will also unlock the next opponent. The other 2 stars are gained by completing the objectives which are different for each opponent, then winning, since even if you complete the objectives, they won't count unless you win the match too. These Challenges range from doing specific trick shots, reaching a certain score, using no flashbacks(feature where you can redo a shot twice per match), etc. There is only one use for stars. Each of the Bonuses Matches are 'linked' to an opponent. When you beat that opponent, therefore getting 1 star, the next opponent is unlocked. However, to unlock the Bonuses Match linked to that opponent, you must have at least 2 stars, which includes the one you get for beating him.There are 2 Tour modes, each containing the same 4 competitions, each divided into 3 Rounds. Each competition is increasingly more difficult. In order of easiest to hardest: Sky Lounge Cup, Exchange Square Cup, West Coast Trophy, and Valley Lodge Masters. Initially you only have access to the Sky Lounge and Exchange Square Cup, but you can unlock them in order, starting from the Exchange Square Cup if you wish.Each Competition features a new area, and each Round features a version of that area at a different time of day. So Round 1 for the Sky Lounge During the Day, Round 2 for Evening, and Round 3 for night. Each time of day alters the look of the area to varying degrees, all of which look great. Beating a round will unlock that location/time to choose when creating a Versus or Online game.Now for the Bonus Matches I mentioned. In each Tour mode, there are various 'Bonus Matches' which deviate from the 8/9 Ball ruleset, which are Straight, Rotation, Killer, 3 Ball, etc. Completing the bonus match will award you a star, and also unlock a new graphic for either your Cue Stick, Table Decal, or Pool Ball skin. Bonus Matches are not necessary for advancing in the Tour.There is also a Versus game mode, which can be against a human player or against the AI. You start with one AI opponent on the easiest difficulty, and you unlock more by defeating them in the 8 and/or 9 Ball Tour. For a Human vs Human Versus game, it's a local multiplayer game, where you either share the keyboard and mouse, or 1 person uses the keyboard/mouse and the other uses a Controller. Theres many ways you can set up a Versus game: You can change the look of the Cue Stick, Pool Balls, and the Table Decal with skins/textures you've unlocked during the Tours Bonus Matches. You can change the ruleset, ranging from the classic 8 Ball and 9 Ball, to Straight Ball, Speed, Killer, Golf, 3 Ball, and Rotation rulesets. Online mode is basically the same, but with added ranked/unranked/custom options.In the main menu there's also ""Free Play"" mode. This give you the 9 Ball set up, but you can do anything you like. There's no human opponent, and you can consider it a practice mode, especially for practicing your trick shots. You can pick up the cue ball whenever you like and place it wherever you like. Once you pocket all the balls, it simply resets the table. I like to use this mode when I want to relax, practice trick shots, or just goof around and see how many balls I can send flying off the table in one shot. Pity you can't send it through a window. :pAlso in the main menu is Endurance mode. In this mode you need to make shots(also called 'potting' or 'pot') as fast as you can. New balls will constantly spawn, and when the active ball count on the table reaches 24, you lose, so you need to keep potting. After potting enough shots, you'll earn a brief period will the spawn rate will completely stop, giving you some breathing room.One thing that should definitely be mentioned, is the Aim System. There's various aim modes which will project not only where the Cue Ball will go, but the direction of the ball you're hitting. This is great for making not only regular shots, but making trick shots easy too. There's multiple levels of Aim projection, which will gradually decrease how far it will project the shot, then only show the cue ball's path, and finally no aim mode, where it won't even show the Cue Ball's path. This, combined Free Play, will help you become better and better.While we're on the subject of practicing, there's a Tutorial mode in the Single Player menu. This will teach you how to do various shots. From simple straight shots, to Jumping, Curving, Knife, Kick, Bank, etc shots. It's great for learning the various moves. There is an odd graphic bug/oversight. While the tutorial plays, it will always show the keyboard/mouse bindings at the top, but when it's your turn to try the shot, it'll show whatever control method you're using. It's not a big deal, since the controls are simple and there's even an option in the settings that will let you push the Help button, which is 'X' for controllers and 'K' for Keyboard, and will show all the controls at anytime and any game mode, so this game does great for helping beginners, but has the option of turning them off. You can save replays of your matches too, so you can view them again. Also works in Free Play mode. The replay feature isn't as fleshed out as it could have been, but it's okay.People have complained about controls, so I'll throw in my opinion: After playing it for a few hours with both the Xbox Controller and Keyboard, it does feel like it was intended to be played with the controller. HOWEVER, the keyboard and mouse controls are still great and nowhere near as bad as some have complained, and feel almost completely natural. I say 'almost' because I'm the type to keep my hand in a single position and dislike moving it too far. However, it's very easy to remap the keys closer, and honestly, only 2 or 3 keys I needed to move closer, and they weren't even necessary really. And in the Straight ruleset, the shot calling function was very awkward and overly sensitive for the keyboard/mouse. The replay modes keyboard/mouse controls are also awkward to use no matter how you map it.Anyway, to summarize: Great pool game, many game modes, online multiplayer, and great controls for BOTH the keyboard+mouse and controller. Most of the complaints on the keyboard controls are over exaggerated.Master Edit: Apparently there's a character limit to reviews, though I'm guessing it's rare for someone to waffle on enough to reach it. So yeah, I've edited this review over 6 times adding more info and correcting mistakes. Had to delete the other edits to make room for more waffle.			"

												Being a gentlemanly fan of both snooker and pool myself, I felt I should give this game a go, and I was most certainly not dissapointed! It is most certainly a woppingly spiffing game, and I must say, it does rather feel as if you are really playing this fine game in real life! You are able to do tournaments, do some rather excellent trick shots and although the challenges make me want to throw my tea across the room sometimes (which would be a scandal!) it only makes you want to play it more and take those challenges head on. By golly! I give this riveting game 4 Cups of Tea out of 5! Tally-Ho!			"

												Extremely fun game!Pool Nation has a very realistic physics engine, with very nice graphics. There is a ton of achievements to be unlocked and replayability is great.There are, however, a few problems with this game: a) If you simply want a quick game, it isn't so quick, because there are lots of menus to go through, and the cutscenes before the game starts are painfully long. b) the graphics are great, beautiful, but some of them very unrealistic when it comes to pool tables. The developers did a great job exploring the rendering engine they had in hand, but I believe there was no need for so many fancy and colored pool tables and balls. IMHO, a pool table has to be green. Forget about everything else, because it just gets in the way of the game.Neverthless, Pool Nation is a great game, worth every penny. I am not afraid to say it is possibly the best pool game ever made, and the closest thing to a pool/billiard/snooker simulator.If the developers ever read this, I have a suggestion: make it possible to create custom game rules, like we do in real life.

												This is an awesome pool simulator. I think it is even the only pool table game on Steam! That is great because I love pool table. The graphics are fantastic, and the style is very modern. You are usually playing in a tall apartment building. The AI's are very smart, I wish they could use the AI's as a feature. They could make two AI's play against each other, creating a randomly generated game of pool table. I think it would be fun to watch! Anyways, I read some reviews about the .exe crashing, and unfortunately, as good as this game is, the glitch is true. The game does crash, almost every play through. I got one in my first minute opening the game. Then I tried again, and then it happened after 30 minutes of playing. It is really hard to sit down and enjoy the game when it randomly crashes. You never know when either, sometimes it's during the splash screen, and sometimes during gameplay. It is hard to sit down, relax, and enjoy the game, when it crashes spontaneously. The developers have a gem, and they are letting a stupid glitch put it to waste. Please fix the game. And also do the AI thing! I'd love to see 2 AI's play against each other. It would create a randomly generated game of pool table.			"

												Recommended.Depending on what you're looking for the single player campaigns are lacking.  There are a lot of opponents but they felt very identical to play against.  However, I wasn't working towards the challenges against each opponent and going for those could be fun, although they're usually pretty same-y (x match score, x-ball streak).  Additionally, there are actual stand-alone challenges but of the few I played they were pretty boring.  While they did break up gameplay when I found it necessary, the AI is so unpredictable  that modes like speed challenge or 3 ball just aren't that much fun.As a 8-Ball and 9-ball simulator, though, this game is pretty excellent.  The physics work, there's a guiding shot marker to help  you learn how to shoot better (this can also be turned off, or reduced) and the game is pretty.  Pool Nations ia  large step up from those crappy flash games.Online play seems functional.  At the very least I didn't have any issues with it.  For online play there are a lot of interesting game modes past 8 and 9 ball including 3 ball, straight, rotation, speed, and killer.  Of those I only tried killer (possibly speed in the campaign) and it was fun, though it felt more like a quick distraction between a few rounds of 8 ball.So yes, I recommend this game.  It's much, much better for me than driving down to the Pool Hall, especially when I can't guarantee I'll have anyone to play.  This is something I needed in my life and it's nice to have, but I also recognize that it's probably not for everyone.  I've only played a handful of times and only for a few hours total.  It's definitely a pick up and play for a few rounds and then put it down for a few weeks kind of game, though that is exactly what I wanted.Oh, and I guess there are features that haven't been implemented yet but are on their way like the box of tricks.  That mode seems fairly interesting.			"

Do yourself a favor guys and play on Champion difficulty for maximum experience.  This makes trick shots still possible without having the guided lines to aim your shot. The game is just to easy on pro and normally see 5-7 pot streaks frequently. Aslo when you make shots you feel more of  a sense of achievement.anyhow BUY this game !!!			"

Also, the game stops working anytime you alt+tab. That's all, if you like pool, get this. I get nicely relaxed playing this, I love all pub-like games. 8/10 "

												A very addicting pool game that also has visual appeal added in. Online matches are few and far between to find, but hosting your own is usually the best way to get into action quick. An added bonus is that you can practice while you wait for an online partner to join. The single player mode is very addicting and it's my most played because the computer gets harder to play and you also have the added pressure of getting all three stars while still winning the game. There are trick shots galore which makes playing even more fun and makes the table open to basically any shot. One added huge bonus is that the developers are constantly reading the discussion forums and tailoring the game to what we discuss. Thank you for making such a wonderful game.Highly recommended.

												If you enjoy pool then you will enjoy this game.Really I have only one complaint, and that is the fact you want to do certain things you need to unlock them.I like the idea of trickshot mess around and yet I need to play to unlock and I only want to do them.The graphics are really nice, and the overal look of the game including the scenery is really good.The audio is spot on with nice clear sounds.The controls are easy to understand and get used too, and simply made.It is nice to see a game made properly and this is an indie game so it is hard to believe an Indie game is well polished and made as this.  Really happy I brought this game for the full price.  It is worth the money I spent and it is on sale a few times for £1 which is insane.So if you enjoy pool etc, then play this game and it is good fun if you turn off the aim assist stuff!			"

												If you plan on playing this in single player only then you should get some good fun out of this.  However the multiplayer appears to be a broken mess that failed to connect to any of my friends or find anyone in the game lobbies.  My friends who bought the game also have the same issues.

												I am a boomer from the Evergreen State.  I like this game because 7/8 of the games are not timed.  I love causual, simple games that have a high degree of simulated realism.  This is a game where you aim and shoot and no-body gets hurt.  I can even try outrageous trick shoots without worrying about ruining the felt or breaking a window.

												This is an excellent, laid-back game that you can play to kill time or relax -- either solo or with a friend. It brings back good memories of playing billiards on miniclip.com wayyy back in the day. The soundtrack compliments the game very well, and I find myself wishing I could download its music.As others have said, the keyboard+mouse controls are somewhat clunky. Luckily I was first introduced to this game on Xbox where I learned how to play with a controller, so when I picked it up on Steam I stuck with that control scheme. I recommend you use a controller if you're able to.I'm not sure if I would recommend this as a $10 game though, since I picked it up heavily discounted in one of the seasonal sales. If you're interested in getting it then wait for a sale -- it'll probably be like $1 or $2.			"

												Great pool game from the graphics to the ball physics. Controls feel great, especially using the mouse as a virtual cue system. Graphics are crisp and colourful with great reflections on balls. Sound is good, music isn't too annoying buy can be turned off if you prefer (which I do). Its challaneging with every game in its tournaments having 3 stars you can unlock for doing specific things like skill shots or winning without losing a frame etc. This means even if you win the tournaments you can go back to specific matches in the tournaments to try and unlock the stars. Lots of unlockable cues, ball sets, locations and decals for the tables.My only downside would be that I hoped more people would be playing this game online. I have found and played people online but there doesn't appear to be many. Hopefully this side of things will improve but even without online gameplay the game is great and well worth the asking price. Best pool game on the PC by far.			"

Honestly, you can pull off some great shots in Pool Nation. The graphics are top notch. The balls themselves show reflections while the camera angles themselves are informative while shooting. Directionals on the shot markers make searching for the perfect lineup acheivable without frustration.Single player looks deep enough, of course online is where i'll be most of the time. Played a match tonight and it was fluid enough with no lag. Chat is available to keep the tension while the game is close!Controller support is great and works wonderfully.

												It's all so shiny and bloom...  bloomy?You'll either take to the presentation or you won't, but the game itself will scratch any pool itch you're currently afflicted with.  Nice and solid, although clearly designed with touchscreens in mind, but if you're playing with a mouse you'll get used to the format in minutes. There's a limit to what can be done with a pool game, but this does its best to keep things interesting - you'll progress through rounds in several tournaments, but each will have little optional challenges to complete; get a streak of 6 balls, pot a ball with a jump shot, that kind of business.

This is great, relaxing and fun pool game, many gaming modes and lots of fun. The only thing I don't like about it is the fact it doesn't gave PUB location. All locations are a bit way too shiny for me. So, we do need PUB location, not so shiny balls and an option to insert our own music to game via jukebox in the corner, because to be honest, music in the game is as far away from the pool as I can imagine it.If you want to play a nice game of pool, look no further, Pool Nation is great.

												Having played alot of pool games over the years, i,ve  got to say that this is one of the best.You have lots of game modes to choose from and can be played to what suits you weather it be a quick game or to take your time with your shots.There is also a good tutorial to teach/show you how to make certain shot like jump ,screw and swerve shots.Ithere are also unlocks for new cue,s balls and baise pic's If i have to be negative there is a fair amount of bloom used in the back grounds.But i am just being picky.If like me ypu love pool this is a must.

												This game really caught my eye on steam, and how could it not, it’s so very very shiny. Released originally on PSN Cherry Pop ported their billiards game over to the PC and is available for $10 via steam.What we have here is really a modern pool game. A sparkling beautiful graphics engine combined with an impressive realistic physics engine all to send shiny balls flying around a table. It’s smooth, it’s pretty, it’s gorgeous. (click on some of my high-res screenshots and see for yourself!) Really what else do you need to know? If you like pool games then it’s for you, if you don’t, all the shiny graphics in the world probably won’t change your mind. What you might expect from a pool game is all here, an 8-ball and 9-ball tour to play through with slowly increasing difficulty as well as some other game modes to throw in some variety.There are also arbitrary points systems that award you points based upon added difficulty of shots (kinda like the way skater games give you points for harder tricks) and as you progress through each tour there are challenges to meet in each match to unlock extra goodies. It’s all your typical completionist fluff we’ve grown to expect from games these days but they do add some extra challenge and drives you to try to be more creative as you play. I also found I enjoyed most of the challenge modes that are unlocked during the tour play although a couple get a little tedious and boring.Everything in the game is well crafted, the table is high textured, the balls well polished and reflective, and even the backgrounds are rich with detail and eye candy. The art style is beautiful and there’s even interesting little blurbs written about each opponent you play against. But all of this eye candy is just background noise to distract you from pocketing those balls! The game really shines though when it comes to trick-shots. Jump shots, draw backs, kick shots, even riding the rail is all possible with the engine. With full control to put on as much english and angle on your shot as you’d like you can put together some pretty sweet shots. Thanks to the shot guides they are not very difficult to learn and once you start pulling them off with regularity your options with each shot open wide. Best of all, the AI knows and uses them just as well which creates quite a challenge as you progress through the game.The trick-shots are definitely best seen in video as screenshots cannot do them proper justice. You’ll be hopping over balls and making crazy draw backs in no time making you feel quite the awesome player. The game is, however, not without it’s flaws. A common complaint I have of many games, the music started to get annoying to me but this is not the first game I’ve had to mute the music and play my own. It is also clear that it is a port rather than designed specifically for the PC.The menus sometimes feel a bit awkward navigating with a mouse and I feel some of the controls are awkward. For example rotating my cue around the cue ball to line up a shot only involves moving mouse left or right, yet my natural inclination is to try to circle the mouse around the cue ball. It made for some very frustrating moments until I realized this. Also I found the video replay system to be- clunky at best. Still even with these small complaints I’d definitely recommend the game if you ever find yourself wanting to shoot some pool.Nailed it!Nailed it!Final Score:Graphics: 10/10Game Play: 8/10Music / Ambiance: 8/10Story: -/10Value: 8/10Overall: 8.5/10Read more indy game reviews on my blog!http://markofithian.com "

												Very nice pool game, even fun to play alone vs AISingleplayer has: Tutorial, box of trickshots (or something) 4x 9-ball tours, 4x 8-ball toursTours include certain ammount of AI matches.Each match can give you 1-3 stars.Usually you get 1 star by winning match which also unlocks next match and then other stars you get when doing certain task during the match (you still need to win the match also)Tasks like: Perform comboshot during match or kickshot or get streak of 7 balls in match + much of other stuff like that.Also getting 2 stars in certain matches will unlock bonus match in that tour.Each tour contain few bonus match to unlock.I have completed first 9-ball tour by 71% and it took me 6 hours, so if other tours take as much time it means total 48h of gameplay and still you havent compeleted everything by 100%, so this game has plenty of nice singleplayer content for your money.Totally recommend this game but be warned: Multiplayer is dead, so dont buy it for online multiplayer			"

												There really is no negative reviews this game should get.  People buying it know exactly what the game is: billiards.  It's not like there is at all any surprise.  You don't get surprised that Taco Bell serves tacos so why would you be surprised a game called Pool Nation is anything but pool? Overall I found it to be addictive fun.  When I bought it, the game was at I'd say a dollar and it was the best thing I've ever bought with only one dollar (NOT EVEN TAX!) I could have bought gum or soda with that $1 but that won't last me and is not as enjoyable as something you can share in an online session with.  If you like or would want to learn about playing pool, this game is honestly the best (and only) pool game I know of.  The only con is that because it is for the computer, the gameplay takes some time to get used to (whether you use the keyboard or a controller).  However, the amount of time it takes you to learn how to play with buttons (versus using an actual pool stick) is time that you also gain experience and tips; so realistically you are not losing anything but gaining more than you pay for!  Being taught how to play a sport (that can be used for real life) is so worth paying only a dollar for.  McDonald's doesn't even have a dollar menu anymore; it's like $1.50.  Though I was fortunate at the time and the game is back to its' original price, the pirce is $9.99 (NOT EVEN $10!!) so it's not too bad a price.  I SAY GET IT!!! But who am I to say?  See for yourself.  You won't be displeased.+Physics: Way too realistic! :)+Price: Cheap!!! :)+Customizable: To some degree.+ Music: Relaxing (If you are immature like me, I thought of porno background music). "

												Oh, this is addicting as heck. I can't put the cue stick down. What's great about this game is you can choose the aim style, from full out novice aim to completely off (which is really hard for me since I suck at billards in real life lol). This kind of reminds me of yahoo pool but more controls over everything! It's a great buy, glad I picked it up for $1.50 and I recommend everyone grab it while you can for this price!Edit: If you Alt-Tab out your game will probably crash. If you Tab-Shift to check your other monitor or change music etc, your game will probably crash lol. Hopefully they will fix this.			"

												Very well done Pool game. I'm a long time Virtual Pool player (15+ years). Physics could be a teeny bit better, like the english (ball spin) physics. In real life, pockets on a pool table have angled cushions around the pocket to help your ball in, should you hit them correctly...In this game however, if you don't hit the ball straight into the pocket, it's not going in. If you hit the angled portion around the pocket, it will just reject your ball much of the time, really unforgiving but challenging. Hard to explain...think of a basketball hoop where if you didn't swish the ball, the ball would never go in. I don't use that aim assist or flashback bullcrap either. That's for sissies!Easy on the eyes and shiny as hell, though. I think the lighting on the balls (ha, balls) could be a lot better. Also, like the virtual pool series, it's a great game to play and mute all the in-game sound if you're in the mood to rock out to some of your mp3s, you can fully enjoy your music and the game at the same time.The game is still in development so I think it will improve over time. There are few odd glitches here and there. Buy this game the next time it's on sale and come play with me!			"

												Pool Nation is how I imagine my life would be if I was a lottery winner, a pimp, or Jordan Belfort. The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before. You can’t quite tell what it is but it’s shinier, sexier, it’s got more curves and it leaves you wanting more every time. In the words of Jon Martello, this is a game where ‘I just ♥♥♥♥in’ lose myself’.			"

												I've read some people not reccomending this because of the controls, i have not had any problems with the controls... its quite simple really plus at any point you can press k to view the controls, what an awful reason to not reccomend a game. I've never been a huge pool fan but im very addicted to this, at first glance it seems like no ones online but host up a game and wait 2 to 10 minutes and you will find an oponent while you wait you can practice as well so its not just sitting there doing nothing. as far as pool games go there is nothing better that i have seen than this. the environments look really detailed even though most if not all your attention will be on the table. my ONLY two complaint about the game is you cannot alt tab without it crashing in fullscreen mode and the in game chat is pretty buggy.

												Being an avid pool player IRL I have downloaded a few billiard games both on PC and Android. I truly can say that this is one of the best poll games I have played. If you have never picked up a pool stick before this game is created to help you learn all you need to know on how to play. In no time, you will be preforming curve and jump shots. This game has everything an avid pool player would look for. I can see myself playing this game for years to come without the need to find a better game. I love 8 ball, 9 ball and straight pool. I am not into the other billiards games like Snooker, Carrom or Crokinole so this game is ideal for me. I like the fact that you have bonus achievements to try and accomplish during each match to obtain a 3-star winning. It’s not just point and shoot over and over. The graphics are sweet eye candy and the music must be from some relaxing waterfall video because it can almost put you to sleep. This game is a must have for my library.  RATE: 9 1/2 OUT OF 10  "

												As an avid pool player, this game is perfect, 9ball and 8ball are the two main games (no 10ball, perhaps an idea for an update) with extras including killer, golf, endurance and straight (amongst others). As of this review this game is still the only pool game on steam and quite frankly you don't need to pay for any other once you have bought this, hours of fun await if pool is your thing.One slight negative, and this is me being a little petty is once all the stars have been earned, they stay earned, there is no reset button that i am aware of.

												I'm not very good at pool - despite years of physics education I just can't picture in my mind how the balls will bounce because I can't ""see"" the trajectories in my mind.  But (or perhaps Because), I'm obsessed with pool.  I've played a decent number of pool games on PC and tablet and this one is - hands down - the best.  The physics are amazing and the graphics are a thing of beauty.  It's something you can play for 2 straight hours or just a quick 10 minute game.Honestly, if you enjoy pool at all, this game is worth it - even if you can't catch it on sale.			"

												It's a pool game and it's really good!  Physics seem spot-on, controls are functional and graphics are nice and shiny. I've been looking for a decent pool game for years, and this is definitely it. Campaigns were not particularly difficult to finish or long, but I would imagine online is where this game will truly come to life.So yeah, if you want a pool game, this is it. I don't think there really is anything else on the market of comparable quality at the moment. It's not even expensive![EDIT]: A lot of people seem to be complaining about the game being broken and buggy, and I feel I should comment on this. When I first purchased the game, it indeed was buggy, there were severe slowdowns during gameplay, and the occasional crash as well. HOWEVER, I tried this game again recently, and all stability issues etc. are gone. It works wonderfully at the moment, at least for me.			"

												These guys nailed it. I didn't think anyone could duplicate so perfectly the feel of a real game of pool on a PC, while making it easy to get into. They put a lot of thought into this game, polished it, loved it. The sound and feel is so realistic, I'm quite astonished. This is the kind of pool game that will stay in your library and will turn to for the indefinite future. It's an excellent party game if you have a bunch of friends over but no pool table in your home or cave. The graphics are beautiful and stylish, but yet not overdone; they're just right while being simulatenously eye candy. I've never played a PC pool game as nice as this. I will always cherish this game!			"

												Hands down the best pool game I've played. Graphically, it borders on being a tech demo for high end lighting and reflection effects. It's ridiculously shiny. The felt looks like felt. (I would not be surprised to see this game come bundled with every graphics card released in the next five years. It makes your GPU look like a hero.) The physics are just as good: crisp and consistent. Lots of game modes. Lots of cue sticks, balls, table decals, and pool halls to unlock. (I've played for 9 hours, I'm reasonably good at pool, and I've only opened up the easiest fourth of the unlockables.) Thanks to the quirky descriptions of your opponents before the matches, the game ends up having a ton of personality, considering it doesn't render the players at all, only their ghostly, floating sticks. It's got solid multiplayer, at least for two people. By people I mean friends. You can play big tournaments, in theory, with larger groups of strangers.Perhaps most importantly in the context of 2014 gaming, Pool Nation is getting continued love and support from its devs. Snooker and ""Box of Tricks"" are both coming soon as free updates, and the devs are active in the forums.As I write this, the game is on sale for $1.50. It's correctly priced at $10, so $1.50 is a steal.			"

This kind of reminds me of yahoo pool but more controls over everything!

												Pool Nation is how I imagine my life would be if I was a lottery winner, a pimp, or Jordan Belfort. The game deserves a solid 9/10, losing out on full marks quite simply because the only thing it’s missing is pornstars wandering around in 6inch stilettos and lines of coke and rolled up 20 dollar bills laying haphazardly about the place.  What this game does extremely well, is that it makes you feel important. It draws you into a world where you can be the person you’ve always wanted to be in real life, a world where paying $15 for a drink wouldn’t make you penniless by end of the evening, a world where every woman wants to blow you and every dude……. Well who gives a f*#k if every chick wants to blow you right?? Pool Nation offers something different than any other pool game I’ve seen before. You can’t quite tell what it is but it’s shinier, sexier, it’s got more curves and it leaves you wanting more every time. In the words of Jon Martello, this is a game where ‘I just ♥♥♥♥in’ lose myself’.			"

The game also gives enough of a hand to help you such as projection lines all of which can be tailored to your virtual pool skills (or lack of in my case). When you get bored you can set up some trick shots with this really great engine.Maybe this game might not be worth its full price (only because it is far to casual and is more a play for an hour a day tops sort of game but definately between $2 to $7 worth every penny (or yenny in my case).

												It's a pool game. That should be enough to get you to buy it. However, this game is fantastic. You can see the venue in the reflection on the balls. The controls are great and allow you to do swerve shots, jump shots, and knife-edges by setting power, cue angle, and spin. There are a lot of different matches in multiple single player modes (9-ball, 8-ball, etc.) and there are challenges in each one. Some matches unlock a bonus stage in which you can unlock new ball designs or new cues by beating your opponent in things like 3 ball, straight pool, and killer. The only thing it's missing is player models, but that doesn't take away from the game at all. Seriously, it's worth the 10 bucks, but if it's ever on sale, you really should buy it!			"

It's something you can play for 2 straight hours or just a quick 10 minute game.Honestly, if you enjoy pool at all, this game is worth it - even if you can't catch it on sale.			"

												Pool Simulator pulled directly from the imagination of a younger me..I remember shooting virtual pool for the first time on a cell phone, wondering when I would see a convincing simulation.This is pretty much exactly what I had pictured, with better menus and more intuitive controls.  Very smooth game, really captures everything I love about pool.If you can't make it to a real table, pick this up, it'll help keep you satisfied until your next knock around some real felt.  I get the feeling you might even pick up some new tricks to try out for your next real game too, I know I did.			"

												Good Stuff: Pool Nation is pretty. Well, okay, you can quite plainly see that, but it's fairly pretty gameplay wise, too. Once you get the hang of the controls... Which is easy enough, because the tutorials are quite helpful, and the aiming sight, even on default settings, is actually useful for everything except hardcore kick shots... The game gives you that little bit of extra motivation to up your game by asking you to do challenges while you beat the AI's ♥♥♥. ...Okay, the AI is also quite fair in this game, and so sometimes (especially on 3-ball, an event you'll love to hate) it'll kick your ♥♥♥. Beat a certain number of challenges, you'll get bonus levels. Beat bonus levels, or certain characters, and you'll get customisation for your table decals, cue decals, and ball style.Problems: There *is* online multiplayer for this game, but sadly, it's very, very dead, presumably because pool afficianados prefer a local fix (I sure do!) Also... The high reflection on the balls can sometimes make it difficult to tell what's what, even in Overhead view. Finally, the soundtrack, while chill, gets a little repetitive at times, and doesn't really cover that ""Playin' Pool/Billiards in a pub/club"" feel.Conclusion: Even for the non-sale price, this game is worth the cash (5 hours in, and while I could *theoretically* beat the AI players in that time, 100%ing each players' challenges is a slightly different story), and for something to relax to, then wonder ""Wait a minute, wasn't it 6PM a minute ago?"", there's few better things than a game of 'puter Pool.

												I think Pool Nation is one of those games that knows exactly what it is, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Pool Nation is a billiards game, that's it. It's a slick-looking multiplayer/singleplayer campain billiards game.And it's fun as hell.Weirdly enough, I'm comparing this to Sniper Elite V2. While the two games' topics are in no way similar, both play out in coincidentaly similar ways. For example, both Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2 hav slick, shiny graphics that look AMAZING. The graphics on both games look professionally made and I just love it. Graphics haven't been a huge thing for me, but wow, Pool Nation's graphics are actually better that Call of Duty Ghosts, and to top it off, my computer can run it.Another weird similarity is the ""killcams"". In Sniper Elite V2, if you hit the enemy in a certain place, the camera pans out to the bullet or the enemy, and you get to watch the enemy get shot up close. In Pool Nation, if you make a Skill Shot or just a nice looking shot, the camera sets up on the hole, and you watch the ball fly in. The only difference is, Pool Nation does this less. For me, almost every shot in Sniper Elite was a killcam, and it got annoying as hell (except the ball shots). But the killcams only happen periodically in Pool Nation, and THANK YOU SO MUCH for doing so.And the last thing, if you think about it just a tad, playing pool is almost like sniping. You have to aim carefully at a specifis target (and in some cases many targets) and shoot. Not only to you target all if the solid or striped balls in pool, but you also aim at a certain hole and shoot! How weird is that?So now you know why I compared Pool Nation and Sniper Elite V2. Pretty good comparision if you ask me, but overall I think Pool Nation is worth your money. It's an amazing pool game, but its not Steam's only pool game.Buy it and hit me up.			"

												i absolutely love this game.  the graphics are amazing.  the 11 different games are all fun and fun to learn and also challenging... i'm not a fan of pool very much in real life- i've played at these 10 dollar for an hour at a table places and there's the social aspect, and people wanting u to rush, and of course the- no trick shots- sign.  with this i just play in my room at my own pace, relaxing like a game of golf, learning new games.  i've played 30 hrs and am still barely into the first tournament.  i should note i have a controller but i use the mouse- i find that movement relaxing like on golf games- the pulling back and pushing forward.  but as i said, i'm not very good at pool but now i'm learning like jump shots and banks and such.  i cannot say enough about how enjoyable this game is- i can't wait for snooker. i would recommend this to anyone, pool fan or not.

												I was apprehensive before getting this game because I've had a few billiards video games over the years and to be frank they all seem to be lacking.  The control of the cue, the physics of the balls, and the plausibility of the shots either make me feel like I'm being guided through the game or is so uncomfortable playing that it's just not enjoyable.  Video billiards has always reminded my of video pinball in that there just isn't a video game that can capture the feel of playing.  While this game ""Pool Nation"" won't replace the actual feel of playing actual billiards... it's miles ahead of many billiards video game I've played that are out there.  The only comparable game is ""Virtual Pool 4"", which is a good simulation but ""Pool Nation"" graphics are a bit better and this game seems a little more reactive to your intent for playing.  In other words, this game ""Pool Nation""seems to be a bit more user friendly when trying to do what you want on the table than VP4 is.The game gives you excellent control of the cue that includes spin, english, angle, and power.  The controls are easy to learn but I highly recommend the tutorial in game to learn it.  It's short enough not to get boring and you need to learn the skills to play the game and the tutorial treats each lesson as a segment to complete and check off.  The ball physics are a good feel.  I can see myself lining up the shots and predicting the shots as I would on a regular billiard table.  Nothing's perfect of course but the devs did a good job here in my opinion.There are billiard circuits to play for single player and multiplayer.  There's leaderboards, achievements, and trading cards.  Steam Workshop seems like a natural for this type of game where you should be able to customize locations, cues, tables, rooms, or even players etc.. A good pool game for a nice price... on sale of course.			"

												Do you like playing Pool, but can't afford a real Pool table or can't find the space to fit one in your house? If so, then Pool Nation is a game you might enjoy.Modes include free play (which lets you do whatever you want, recognizing no rules whatsoever), Eight Ball, and Nine Ball. The latter two are done in tournaments, where you face progressively more difficult opponents. Each opponent has bonus criteria, which when met, net you more points but also some opponents have extra modes. These extra modes include bonus games (with varying rules) to earn new Pool cues, felt table skins, and ball designs. None of these really matter as far as the game itself is concerned, but it's nice to get something extra when you do better than average. Sound and music are basic, although the music I found a little annoying. Take that with a grain of salt, as I often find music in games to be irritating. The sounds fit the game nicely, although they were nohing to write home about.Graphics are amazing. I grew up in a house with a real Pool table and except for a few angles here and there, the table and balls all look incredibly realistic. You can also view the game from your character's POV or use a top-down view. I'd strongly recommend the latter.The controls include mouse and keyboard or a controller. I used a wired Xbox 360 controller, as I found the analogue sticks to work better than relying on the digital input of the mouse or keyboard. Every once in a while it seemed like the game interpreted my stick movement as much weaker than I intended, but for the most part, it worked very well.One thing that makes this game much, much easier than real Pool is the inclusion of guides. These guides show you where the ball will go when you hit it and adjust on the fly when you change anything about your shot. Some people might see this as cheating, so on higher difficutly levels the guides are reduced or removed entirely. Multiplayer is available, although I have no idea how well it works. I've stuck entirely to single player against the AI. Considering the overall age of Pool Nation as well, there may not be many players left actively searching for games either.I will warn potential buyers that Pool Nation's developer seems to have abandoned the game. If I'm wrong about that, I apologize. To be fair, Pool Nation is 100% done, so there really isn't much more to do other than fix a bug or two if/when they pop up. Pool Nation is on sale a lot on Steam and through third-party stores, like Humble Bundle or Bundle Stars. so I'd suggest waiting for a sale to purchase it. That wait shouldn't be too long.All in all, I'd recommend this game. It's entertaining, relaxing (for the most part), and doesn't require in-depth knowlege of sports or quick reaction times.			"

												Being an avid pool player IRL I have downloaded a few billiard games both on PC and Android. I truly can say that this is one of the best poll games I have played. If you have never picked up a pool stick before this game is created to help you learn all you need to know on how to play. In no time, you will be preforming curve and jump shots. This game has everything an avid pool player would look for. I can see myself playing this game for years to come without the need to find a better game. I love 8 ball, 9 ball and straight pool. I am not into the other billiards games like Snooker, Carrom or Crokinole so this game is ideal for me. I like the fact that you have bonus achievements to try and accomplish during each match to obtain a 3-star winning. It’s not just point and shoot over and over. The graphics are sweet eye candy and the music must be from some relaxing waterfall video because it can almost put you to sleep. This game is a must have for my library.  RATE: 9 1/2 OUT OF 10  "

												To say that Pool Nation is a great billiards game is an understatement. I dare say that it can take someone with little to no interest in pool and turn them in to a fan after just a few minutes of play. The controls feel very natural and with the help of tutorials, you will be pulling off jump, combos, and bank shots like the pros. This game is the yard stick that all other pool games should measure themselves by. The graphics are gorgeous and the music is very Zen. Mix in the clacking of pool balls and you'll find yourself a serene yet challenging experience. I highly recommend for anyone who wants a game you can play for a few minutes or hours on end. My only wish would be for more than two player support. Perhaps to watch an online game in a ""odd man out plays winner"" scenario.			"

												An outstandingly simple but well-executed game, Pool Nation does one thing but it does it very very well. Actually, that's not really accurate, because there are a great many components of the game that work seamlessly together, including the lobby, multiplayer connection, freeplay for practicing for a no-stress way to improve your game, and a wry sense of humor. The ability to play on your own in the lobby while waiting for friends to connect is one example of a small feature that makes a world of difference.The other wonderful thing has been the active and friendly development staff who have been available online to answer questions, address bugs, and take suggestions for improvements and changes. All in all a wonderful effort at a great price, and I hope the devs are able to continue to support it and continue bringing their level of quality control to their next game.			"

												As close as possible to get to the real thing.  The ability to take trick shots is well balanced with practical physics, making for an enthralling sim.  ...this game makes me laugh & smile.  If you're new Pool Nation is accomodating, featuring a few different ways to practice & easy to learn (if a bit slippery at first) controls.  A pro can appreciate the tournament structures, the spot on rulesets, the tricks, & the challenges, which are a bit like wagers in a bar.  Quite realistic, that.  Pool Nation is rendered beautifully & has all the charm & atmosphere of Poker Night 2's outlandish settings.  The music is well mixed, adding to the full effect.  Everyone should own this game.

BUT on the other hand this is what I consider to be the best pool game on Steam (of which there are like 3, and 2 of which are made by the same company). Back in my day there was only 1 pool game on Steam and you had to take what you could get because Steam didn't give 2 ♥♥♥♥s if you wanted another pool game, they were too busy putting crappy mobile ports on Steam for $10. But this game is good and you should buy it if you like pool, which I guess you do since you are here looking at this game.			"

												When I first got this game, I was hoping so much, that it would be pretty much just like Virtual Pool 3, but with better graphics. Essentially, that's pretty much what I got! At first, I wasn't sure if I liked the ""feel"" of it as much, but once I'd played a good few games, I find I do like it a lot! The only bad things I have to say about it (and it's not even that bad) is that there is a slight difference in the movement of the cue stick between single player, and multiplayer. I'm not sure if it's just my pc or not, but for me, single player feels very 1:1 in terms of how much I expect the cue stick to move in relation to how much (and quickly) I move the mouse. In multiplayer for me, it feels like there is a very very slight delay between me moving the mouse, and it moving the cue. When I say very very slight, I really mean it. It's easily the kind of thing you can get used to, and after playing several games, I barely even notice it myself, unless I actually jump from playing single player, straight in to an online game. The only other disappointing thing, is that it doesn't have Snooker. If it did, this would be the penultimate pool game! Certainly not a deal breaker though! If you like pool games, or are a fan of the Virtual Pool series, you won't regret purchasing this at all. I've played many many games online with a friend of mine (usually several matches a day!) and we both get great enjoyment from doing so! As you can see from my playtime, I've already spent a significant amount of time playing this, and it's only going to grow further! Trick shots are hard to master, but once you get your head around how to do jump shots and curve shots, whole new ways of playing become apparent, and you truly start to feel like a master!The single player is challenging and fun, and having mini goals in each round keeps you coming back for more, since usually completing those goals, leads to unlocking new locations, balls, decals and cues.At it's current price of $1.49, you'd be crazy not to grab a copy! I think I payed $3 or $5 for it at the time of purchase, but I would say that even if it was $10-$15, it's still worth every cent!			"

												This is the best virtual pool game that I've ever played, period. It's addictive and instructive. My Real Life™ game has improved, thanks to the accurate physics and cue aiming system. As an enthusiastic supporter, who wants this game to become a household name, I have a few humble suggestions for the developers:1.  Please add more tournaments featuring more game types:      a. British 8-ball      b. Snooker      c. Straight      d. anything else you can think of...2.  Maybe add more types of tables... at my local pool hall, there are, at least, three distinct styles of tables:      a. Quarter-drop - small green, big pockets      b. Big/Big - big green, big pockets      c. Big/Little - big green, itty-bitty pockets      d. Is ""Bumper Pool"" a real thing? I'd play it...3.  I am far more likely to pay for decals, cues, balls, and locations, than I am for trick-shot materials.4.  Some sort of local playlist ability for the background music.I'd like to say again...I'm a HUGE supporter of this game. If you like to shoot pool, in Real Life™, you'll love this game. "

												A pretty solid pool game, which is something Steam has being missing for a while. The physics feel right, the game looks pretty and it has several game modes to keep you entertained enough. Endurance mode is an especially neat game which tests the players skills over a prolonged (10-15 minute or so) session. With the Box Of Tricks DLC coming for free in the near future, and a (paid for) Snooker expansion planned as well, you can't really grumble at the game...providing you're into pool, duh!			"

												This is one game that made me hate the Steam special sales. I picked it up during the Summer Sale for 6€, asked a friend if he's interested in playing some pool and he was, bought it too and we enjoy the hell out of it, i would pay even 30€ for this game. I played PC Billard games from the 90's on, all the Virtua Pools and whatever is out there and i play Billard in real-life and this is the best simulation i've seen so far. There are a lot of game modes (3-Ball, 8-Ball, 9-Ball, Rotation, Killer, Golf, Speed, Endurance) and a small career style mode where you unlock locations, queues, ball designs and layouts for the table - so it's even fun in single player but absolutely shines in multiplayer. The graphics are nice an shiny and the music is greatBest thing of all is that the developers actually are active in the forums and listen to the fans and their wishes. I can't wait for the trick shoot stuff and the Snooker mode and whatever else they plan.			"

												Probably the best, of many pool remakes I have played. It's very humble-feeling, with fantastic, smooth graphics and relaxing music. Not much else to be said. It's got Steam Workshop and plenty of built-in gamemodes, worth a decent amount of play-time. The only notable drawback is the lack of multiplayer matches, but I'm sure the current Summer sale will alleviate that. It's good to have a buddy to play with though, just in case. Another issue is that you can only have 2 player matches, when in reality there are many potential 3 player gamemodes. I play with a friend over Teamspeak, and this is our go-to game when we can't think of anything else to play. Heavily recommend.			"

												I like this game alot. It lacks a bit of the old time sleazy pool-hall atmosphere, which, to me is a big part of the game. The settings are a little too modern for me but having said that, the game is solid. I like the aiming system and the AI players really need to be kept at bay or on the higher levels, they will run the table even though they can miss some very easy shots but like humans, they just plain miss now and then. I have not tried the trick shots much so I can not speak about those but if you just want to play some decent 8 or 9 ball, get this. It sells pretty cheap too. It just needs some snooker !Oh, and some more pub-like settings. I want to hear my mates swearing in the background :)Note, there are many complaints now about the devs abandoning the game and not updating in a bit so if that is an issue for you, take heed.			"

												Pool Nation is a fun fantasy pool game but I found frustration outweighed my enjoyment over time due to many small issues. I regularly had an issue where stars in levels would not be awarded after the match when the in-match tracking said I had completed the challange and I had won both the game and match. This lead to completing stars up to four times before the game successfully registered them. Another frustrating but not game breaking issue was that the overhead view became blocked on some levels which left me with only the on table view. This view is enough to play on, but still limited my options. A lot of little things like this detracted from the game for me and lead to me sending it to the done pile earlier than it should have been. I found this game to be worth the money I spent, but still fails to be something I can recommend.			"

												I spent a lot of time looking around for a good pool game. While there are a few options on steam, Pool Nation is by far the best option. I am quite satisfied playing it and, have lost track of time too often! The physics are great, it plays great and has a lot of different game options. The only thing I wish it had was Snooker, but it seems that most pool games do either 8-Ball & 9-Ball, or just Snooker.I picked this up while it was on sale and have been quite happy! I say even at full price, this game is well worth it for any pool enthusiasts!			"

												This is a really fun game, and if you really like pool then I recommend this game to you. It's fun to play both against the computer and online. Endurance mode is a good test of your skills as well. The only con is it seems like some of the bonus challenges are a bit too difficult to win against the AI, for example the one where you have to pot the entire table in less tim than the AI, that took a good 45 minutes of attempting. Overall it's a really nice game though and I don't have many complaints about it. I can finally feel good at pool.			"

												Time Bought: Pre OrderedMoney Spent: $7.50Worth The Price?: YesPosition In Game At Time Of Review: 2 weeks into the game, half way or 1/3 thru most of the gameOk, first off this game is NOT going to make you better in real life...unless you don't understand the physics and geometry of billiards and are just a point and shoot player.  The game takes getting used to and might even mess up your real life game.  Imagine a REALLY PRETTY pool on Yahoo Games, because the rails, physics,  table speed, and power value are kind of the same.  So I wasn't able to do the 5 cushion cross bank combos that I'm used to doing in real life :P  I also don't understand how putting more power on your stroke will curve your bottom right/left shots.  The physics of reverse english and carom pool are also off.  And stop shots are really hard to do.  I'd much rather play in real life than play this game online.  But maybe it's just me since I used to be a former billiards pro and am just being picky :PRating: 7/10			"

												Best looking billiards sim i've seen. But quite frankly, there are a basket of errors still clearly visible. The UI is wonky, and this game crashes every other time I play it. Its fun, but slow paced. I just hope that the devs continue to support this game as it has quite the potential to be a lot of fun. The biggest downside, is that it flat out does not use the correct rules. Maybe it's a licensing issue, but it certainly is a pain when your opponent scratches on the 8 ball and does not lose the game.			"

												Pool Nation & Bumper Pack BundleIncludes 6 items: Pool Nation, Pool Nation - Flair Pack, Pool Nation - Pack of Pipes, Pool Nation - Ramp Pack, Pool Nation - Skate Pack, Pool Nation - Sports PackFor S$1.95, it wouldn't be a big loss even it sucks. It's a port over from Xbox so there are many problems. It won't be a mainstay but worth playing once in a while, just waiting for multiple ball collision help to come out.PROS1. Good priceEasy entry price and I don't mind supporting Cherry Pop Games at this price level.2. Pool ExplainationsHelped me to understand Pool terms in an easy manner.3. 3D tricksThe old pool games on Yahoo were only 2D and you weren't able to jump balls. In 3D, being able to jump the ball is quite satisfying.CONS1. TutorialsTricks with fine adjustments had a major problem. If you pressed F, the tutorial would give you a green tick even if you we aiming all over the place. 2. GraphicsThe default graphics suck. I couldn't even read the words in the tutorial, I thought Left Click was Left Shift. Tried it on 1280 * 768 resolution @ 60Hz... Much better...3. Overhead viewAs I played the game as a newbie, I realised I would never bother with trick shots. I would just use the Overhead view 4. Multiple ball collisionsThe game can't show how multiple collisions work e.g. proxying a ball. If you hit the cushion to hit your ball, it will only show where the white ball goes to. This turns me off from trying more difficult shots vs winning the game. If the issue is player difficulty, perhaps the developers could create 1. Easy 2. Medium 3. Hard 4. Pro modes for players. With Easy showing how all the balls will move and Pro having zero help.On a side note : Just learned that you need 5 minutes of game time even before you write a review. I changed my review to Yes after playing 8 ball.			"

												the best game I have ever come across, I hit the cue ball towards the edge thing and it flew off the table and into my face!if I had 3d I would have ducked srsly it was that real. bloody screen so real!also you can play online or offline (whats that?) against ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE aka AI these are bots (""robots"") which have been developed by the developers in order to provide opponents for people who don't understand they have the internet or are lonely or something like that.apparently these ai's have been around for a long time in games, but in pool, nation they are extremely useful because your friend didnt buy himself the game but bought it just for you.graphics - 10 million out of square root cubedgeneral ambience - 80000%balls - 9 when you play 9 ball poolabsolute significant milestone in history of gaming			"

												Pool Nation is an all around great pool simulation game. It reminds me very much of the games of old, DOS era and such pool games. It get's a 5 out of 5 in all categories applicable for me. I have a very small  complaint, you can't walk around as the other player in Local Multiplayer. On that note for some reason you can't play Golf in Network Multiplayer? This though, are only a very small complaints.Score 98. Due to some small features missing from Multiplayer. "

												It's ♥♥♥♥ing pool. If you enjoy pool, buy this game about pool, as its representation of the game of pool is accurate to its IRL counterpart, pool. If you're dissatisfied with the game of pool because your gf's bffs are always beating you at the bar using the almighty distraction technique of cleavage, buy this game about pool because it has no cleavage to distract you from the game you're playing, which is pool. If you don't like pool because you're bad at pool and just want to watch some random guy at the bar's gf's bffs squeezing their num-nums together to beat him at pool, then you'll probably want to skip this game about pool, as you don't enjoy pool and this game is all about the game of pool.tl;dr it's ♥♥♥♥ing pool. It's good because it's about pool, which is a game.			"

												It's kinda tricky to review a Pool game so I will try and break it down into what matters. GraphicsAs you can see in the screenshots the game looks great, it is ported from the Xbox 360 so it will run pretty damn well on almost any computer set up you care to mention and with Anti-alising all the way up it is a very very nice game to look at. The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle thoughGameplayThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops. MultiplayerAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you. OverallConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up			"

												This game is a lot more fun than it looks! The online play feature would be great, but all it needs is more people buying this game. The single-player mode is extremely fun. This is one of the best pool games to exist, and well worth whatever price it's currently going for! I 100% recommend this for EVERYONE. It's currently on sale for $1.99. The more people who play this, the more matches there are for online play. There are ways to do almost anything you've ever imagined in normal pool, in a 3D Virtual environment. I recommend everyone have this in their Steam Inventory, and play around with it first chance you get!			"

												Good game of stripes and solids. Its called 8 ball in the game. I enjoyed this part of the game the best. The computer is good but not overbearing. It brings back a lot of good times playing pool in bars. 9 Ball I want to like but Hate the game play of the computer who seems to be able to make any shot sometimes and then other times will miss the simplest of shots. Its  annoying and makes my want to punch his face. The physics feel very good its not perfect and some of the time it just feels a little off but its very good.I like the unlock system but for whatever reason they made it progressively difficult with 3 stars needed later on to unlock some stuff. However the worst is some of them are busted and dont work like they should. The jump shot is needed to unlock on of the stars and I have done it and not gotten credit for it. Its annoying. A few of the others are just based on luck and thats very annoying as well. The locations you play pool in are very well detailed and looks super great. Sound of the pool is very good. The music can get annoying so I turn it down a lot. Not prefect but very fun and more then worth the $1.50 its on sale for.			"

												It's kinda tricky to review a Pool game so I will try and break it down into what matters. GraphicsAs you can see in the screenshots the game looks great, it is ported from the Xbox 360 so it will run pretty damn well on almost any computer set up you care to mention and with Anti-alising all the way up it is a very very nice game to look at. The UI is nice and easy to use as well although, whislt the controls have had there names changed. It still asks you to press A, B, Start and Back whenever you want to do something. That is more of a monor niggle thoughGameplayThe Pool on display here is very nice. The balls all act realistically and as far as I can tell things like friction have been modeled very well. In the close up slow-mo shots you get sometimes when a ball is potted you can see that the balls are lifting up and sliding about realistically. The sound design helps to sell this as well, with nice clear sound making it all the more satisfying when the ball drops. MultiplayerAs far as I can tell the multiplayer for this game is dead. Which is a shame and slightly confusing. I couldn't seem to find any games at all in any mode so unless one of your friends has the game it is most likely gonna be solo play for you. OverallConsidering The lack of a decent Pool game on PC and the promise of the release of the Trick Shot mode soon I would say this game is well worth picking up			"

												I play 9-ball and One Pocket a lot, so I was disappointed that there was no One-Pocket tourney option.  Despite that, I am just gushing with praise for this game.  I have never played a PC pool game that GOT IT RIGHT the way this game does.  The feeling of the stroke through the mouse, and the configurations options presented for adjusting that feeling, make this probably the closest one can be to playing the game of pool IRL that I have ever experienced.  Jumping balls off the table, kicking safe, figuring out how much you have to cut the ball with spin, everything.  It feels amazing to sit at a PC and really get the immersion of playing a match.I can't recommend it enough already, but if they ever add a 14:1 or One Pocket gameplay (with an AI that doesn't make me want to shoot myself)  I would absolutely go bananas.

												Enjoyable for like five minutes, that and it's pretty to look at. That's about the only nice things I have to say. I'm not going to rip this game a new one or pretend that I'm AVGN. The only things that ♥♥♥♥ me off is the controls. One slight twitch and away your cue aim goes. For a fast pace game you have to play slowly in order to even succed. I also hate the points system, it over shadows the whole ""clear up to win"" aspect of pool giving the impression that highest points wins. Why couldn't they just tally up a score at the end after you win, sort of like a Street Fighter kind of way. Don't buy this at full price, wait for a sale.			"

												Good looking game with pretty reasonable physics, even if the tables seem to have a lot of drag on them, balls feel like they slide rather than roll. Lining up shots is a chore with iffy mouse controls. This is one of those games where you are controlling something with the mouse (the cue stick), but there is still a mouse pointer in a different area of the screen and they don't correspond at all. It is frustrating and distracting and something I didn't expect to see this side of glitchy Windows XP games. It's like half of the game was designed around a controller and the other half was made for keyboard and mouse.I'm sure there is a bit of a gem buried in here if I dig long enough but it just doesn't seem worth the effort.On the plus side you can totally cheat using a straight edge on your monitor to line up your shots, if you cared enough.Bought on sale for $1.49.12-28-14 edit: Achievements are working again.

												Pool Nation is a game about, well, pool. You hit balls, get them in the pots, battle against AI or online, and rage at your friends for their skill at games. But there are a few flaws in this that make the game's screenshots exagerate how the game actually is.First of all, the physics in the balls are AWFUL. Atleast 20 times (not exageration) during my career I got the ball stuck RIGHT AT THE POT and it didn't go in. If we got it to atleast the edge, give us credit or something. It happens to everybody playing pool, but come on, you didn't have to make it THAT realistic. Besides, who has two extra fingers on each hand?Second, the camera controls are amazingly crap. You MOVE YOUR MOUSE to move the camera. That's nice. How about when I'm trying to hit the ball? Can you KEEP THE CAMERA WHERE IT'S AT????? Half the time I'm trying to fix my camera or looking down the cue or I'm a 500 feet tall man that looks on the very top of the pool table.Last, the AI in this game is the hardest I've ever played. If you don't hit a ball, this AI will hit every striped/coloured ball it sees and you realise that you should use your time wisely because he hit all the balls, he's ready to hit the 8 ball, and you have to hurry and hit all your balls. It took me 3 times to beat the first guy. THE FIRST GUY. I have played pool as well, and I've went through the tutorial.My honest review is that if this game is on sale, don't get your hopes too high but you could buy it. If it's at it's regular $10 price, it's not worth your money.			"

Virtual Pool 2 perfected the feel of playing pool with a mouse and did so in 1997, this console port can't come close to that level of fidelity 16 years later.  It's a shame that the most basic element of the game is so bad because there's certainly a lot of game surrounding it.  Maybe you'll like it if you're not a pool player and don't know what the real game feels like?			"

SInce i got Pool Nation, i now consider 8 Ball Pool a ultra dumbed down and stupid pool game .

												BEST POOL GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED !It all begun when i played 8 Ball Pool with my friend on Facebook . I really liked it, and we played it whenever we wanted . While playing, i was thinking getting Pool Nation (wich my friend considered it as a crappy game when he played it on the free weekend of this game) . SInce i got Pool Nation, i now consider 8 Ball Pool a ultra dumbed down and stupid pool game . Too bad that there`s not so many players who are playing in Online Multiplayer :/, it would have been 15/10 . If anyone wanna play Pool Nation with me, just add me :D .			"

												Shoddy port of a simplistic game. Options are severely lacking, and now the game is about to become yet another shelved locked down abandonware as yet another dev takes a dump on all the people who paid them in already search of more people to pay them again.I picture a ladder made of sycophantic gamers being being speedily climbed by a dev with extreme dysentery, each rung of said ladder offering thanks, and hoping the next dev will soil them in a slightly different way, and violently yelling at anyone who tries to talk them into not being a ladder.I suspect I'll get versions of that yelling as responses to this review. I hope I'm wrong about that :)			"

												Stay. Far. Away. From. Singleplayer. Play multiplayer only! the AI is stupid smart in this game, they won't show any remorse or any mercy to you IF YOU MAKE ONE SCRATCH! JUST ONE! they will decimate you like your nothing. Or they will put the balls in position where you can't win or make cheap moves to make the AI have a better or even greater advantage over you which isn't necessary because they already one they just want to rub it in your face some more.the tutorial doesn't help either or it does but the AI will still have that ""Better"" over you and also you might want to reconfigure the controls because this game is extremely senstitive I highly encourage players to play on multiplayer with friends and not play singleplayer until you are ready and sure of yourself.Honestly this game should be Multiplayer only and not singleplayer because the AI mechanics is broken adn this game is better with friends			"

												I have tried this game, and I found the controls to be far from intuitive for me. Maybe this game might be enjoyable to a dedicated gamer who has a passion for pool, but for me, it lacks the feel of a real pool table, and yet also lacks the arcade feel which makes casual gaming enjoyable to me.

												This is an ok game. I wanted to like it because of the great reviews, however sometimes the ball control is dissapointing.  Also, the ball color is difficult to distinguish on my laptop and the game frequently does not allow a complete view of the table.			"

												I only disliked one thing about this pool game.  The right joystick on a 360 pad is used to not only select shot power (pulling back the stick), but also to execute a shot (pushing up on the stick).  With all the strategy that goes into each shot, it's too easy to accidentally execute a shot in this manner.  Worse still, it is possible to push up on the stick with no options set, executing a medium power shot with no options set (power, stick angle, ball spin).  In the options, I could see where to remap some things, but not this.  I really want shot execute to be a button, not a stick that I can bump...otherwise, fantastic game, great price!  This flaw is gamebreaking for me though unless I have a solution to it.			"
