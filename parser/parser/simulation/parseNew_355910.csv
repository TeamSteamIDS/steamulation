												AVGN would say this game sucks♥♥♥♥♥Now to the review.Flying:- about flying physics there i'll say nothing negative. It looks like it works just as planned.- You need to get used to controls (btw. you can invert the input which makes the game much easier) and you master them pretty quick.Landing:- this is where the problems got started. Sometimes you land perfectly and fall down. Sometimes you don't land at all and it counts.- Impulse while landing is just horrible. It's 50/50 you can guess it, often it just makes no sense at all.Objects:- some objects in this game also need a rework. You can get stuck in a tree. You can get stuck on the fountain. You can even get stuck on a bench without dying.- You can land near the chair and it will count. Sometimes it counts too late, so like if you land and start instantly flying it doesn't count the landing and as i said, sometimes you don't even land on an object and it counts as a landing.Conclusion:It's fun for a casual game untill you get to platinum. First level is already ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Missions like ""land on every object in 26 seconds"" are 90% of the time not possible just because of the bugs i described above.It was disappointing for me, since i wanted to 100% the game, which is not possible without spending hours into platinum mod and it just gets annoying really quick.~6/10			"

												Piloteer is a nice and fun little game! It's quite hard to master but the process can be fun instead of rage-inducing. The great and soothing soundtrack helps. The art in it is gorgeous as well!Also the ragdoll is hilarious. I can't help but play around with it and find one thousand different ways to kill a girl in a jetpack.It's a nice game to play casually for only a couple minutes or even to go hardcore and play a few hours in a row, if you're up to the challenge.There are a couple of bugs that still need to be addressed, as it can unexpectedly freeze once or twice. But nothing that hinders the fun gameplay.Fully recommended - at 2.99, it's definitely worth its price.			"

												Suck city. Game appeared to have promise, but glitches with missions just ruined the whole experience. I feel sad everytime I see the game in my inventory. Should have returned it sooner. Damn optimism in me.			"

												Rage inducing fun, at a great price! I haven't run into any bugs yet, but for such a simple game, I imagine that the devs can handle them.			"

												Since I was a boy I've dreamt of having a jetpack. I imagine I'd die as quicky as I do in this game if I ever had one. It's a bit like QWOP where it's meant to be hard to control but you are really only balancing between two inputs. Not a ton of depth but a cute little distraction and certainly worth the modest price. Lots of physics / momentum shenanigans.			"

												This game is a bit fun and funny, as you try and fail repeatedly to control flight with nothing but left-right jet thrusters. Unfortunately, I experienced a great deal of glitchiness in both the handling and landing, as well as the game menus and campaigns. It crashed a few times. Kudos for a decent effort at something way different, but a reluctant thumbs down overall--the game lacks some needed tightening and polishing.			"

												Simple and fun. Using the left and right arrow keys you try to demonstrate to the media how easy flying a jetpack is by completing progressively more challenging tricks and courses, and likely crash hilariously 50 times before successfully landing once.			"

												pretty fun for the 10 minutes I played. It kind of reminds me of happy wheels. They could take this game and add different types of flight devices or other things to play around with and it would be a little more attractive to the player. With what the games offering right now I would not expect for this to be popular. Im only giving it a positive because it reminded me of happy wheels			"

												In the interest of full disclosure I was given a copy of this game for review.An entertaining variation on QWOP style gameplay, featuring an interpid inventor and her many, many crashes on the way to alternative aviation success. Once you get the hang of the game it's a lot more fun, but even when you're not the wrecks make up for it. You can't swim with a jetpack on your back, kids!I made a short video of my gameplay, viewable here:

												Full Disclosure: I was provided with a review copy of this game for YouTube purposes.Imagine Happy Wheels if it has a simpler premise with the same amount of hilarity. A lot of games try to use strange control schemes as a way to pull player in, but Piloteer makes the controls work in a quirky, but fun way. The only directions you can go are up and left or up and right, and like any proper jetback, there are no breaks to speak of. Whether you're completing challenges or just free flying, Piloteer will always give you something to do and something to laugh at!

												This game will be one of those I keep coming back to again and again.Has a lovely aesthetic, and a whimsical piano score to calm your rage when you fail.The best way to get the most out of this game is in short bursts. You will think you are trying to land on a car, but in reality you end up in a tree.			"

												Piloteer, a physics simulator game where you fly a jetpack around to do a bunch of challenges. Simple gameplay makes this a killer purchase. Everything is executed really well. It's overall difficult, but it has a great learning curve. I've had a lot of fun so far.It captures a lot of the fun of QWOP and other physics based games. Starting off deceptively simple, with only two buttons controlling the jetpack pilot. One thrusts to the left, one to the right. Taking baby steps is key. And the missions start off as little tutorials and slowly ramp up to real accomplishments. You eventually feel really good about each landing you do and every goal you complete. And any game that feels that rewarding is definitely worth a play in my book.It has achievements, making the climb to jetpack extraordinaire extra fun.It has trading cards, allowing you to catch 'em all.And it's graphics and music pack quite a charm. Overall, I definitely recommend the experience.
