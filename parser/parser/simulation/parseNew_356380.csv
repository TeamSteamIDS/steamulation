												A wonderful game for anyone interested in orbital mechanics.  A simple concept yet so challenging.  Great to pass the time.  If you know what a three-body problem is, then you'll love this game.Similar to:Kerbal Space Program and OsmosEdit: A builder mode would be nice.  Looking forward to seeing new features in future updates.  Keep up the great work, dev!			"

												You're a coment, you orbit planets etc.Basically you change the velocity and direction of your comet, each time you do, you lose shell.When your shell is gone you can't change your direction or velocity.You complete orbits around the planets X number of times to complete the level.You also can unlock skills to make the comet go faster, last longer, etc.Not terrible for an indie game.

Good low pressure gamingI was looking for a game to play after a hard day of gaming and I think I found it in Orbit.  Sometimes I'm not looking to build a space ship or castle, fight zombies or blow the crap out of everything.  In Orbit, you influence a comet orbiting around planets, but in doing so, the comets shell is slowly lost to space.  Lose all of your shell and you lose you influence and gravity completely takes over.  As you progress and gain 'Stars' you can increase the comets speed or the strength of its shell. It's not without it's difficult levels and I'm not sure how much replayability there is (it seems replayability is not a word), but I'll likely only play through it once.


YouTube™ Video: Orbit, Gravitating the Gilma Nebual 

			Views: 46		

			I explore the Gilma Nebual as a Comet in Orbit, a game I picked up of Steam. My apologies for the audio quality. I don't know what happened and I can't seem to get it to happen again.		

Overall I think Orbit offers good, low pressure gaming for a reasonable price and the casual gamer will probably enjoy it.GameFace			"

												In this game you play a comet, sacrificing your own mass to propel yourself forward, a similar mechanic to Osmos. The unique twist comes here with the element of orbital mechanics. Meeting the bare minimum requirement to pass the levels just requires a few stable orbits - getting higher scores, ratings and stars to unlock stat improvements and new avatars requires you to really think about three body mechanics and is addictive as all hell.The author is also clearly engaged with the community, and I expect this one to keep improving as a result. I reccomend this one wholeheartedly.			"

												Very challenging and fun game.  Orbit is a very fun yet technical game where you, in most cases, will plan out your moves to be as strategic as possible and at the same time avoiding collisions with other planets.  The levels range from very easy to extremely hard (not impossible) and I can honestly say this is a fun game altogether and I am still having fun with it!			"

												This is a good game for the price ($0.99 as I write this).  Completing levels successfully requires you to stay on your toes, and ""taking your time"" (for example, waiting a few orbits for your periapsis to be in the best position to transfer to another celestial body) will cause you to miss out on bonus multipliers, because the game rewards hopping to different bodies every orbit.  As a result, the game is a bit hectic and not relaxing at all.If you’re looking for a bit of a challenge from an unforgiving arcade game, Orbit HD is a dollar well spent.			"

												I personally don't like this type of a gameIt's not an infinite freeride, but a bunch of levels in which you need to orbit around some planets enough times to winIf you want a relaxing, infinte freeride, I recommend Solar 2 (which I love)The music is amazing in this game thoughIf you still like the idea of this game, buy it and if you don't like it, get a refund			"
