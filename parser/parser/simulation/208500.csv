												F1 2012 is the last good F1 game made by codemasters. From F1 2012, the series has been in a decline unfortunely. Apart from a few annoyances (the penalty system mostly) the game is awesome. Having played 500 hours plus both in single player and online, and all the modes, i can truly recommend this game for any racing fan really.			"

												After 70 plus hours in this game, I can confidently admit the game is broken. I can't recommend it in its current state. The game is dazzling to look at, and the sound design is nothing short of incredible with my Soundblaster Z sound card. The feel of the tracks are authentic, making it as if I'm really there. However, the game has a fatal flaw, which results in frustration and ultimate dissatisfaction. The penalty system in the game is simply too stringent. Codemasters said the issue was fixed in F1 2013, but it makes me wonder why they don't patch/fix the issue in this game. There is nothing more frustrating than to be trapped in a group of cars bunched in a corner, and getting a drive through penalty for ""illegal blocking."" Or a car driven by the AI bumping up against you, and acquiring another drive through penalty for unsportsmanlike behavior. I just spent an hour and a half in a race with 28 laps to go, and accrued two such flags in one lap. That pretty much guaranteed a last place finish. This needs to be fixed.			"

												I'm playing on win 10, with an xbox (PC) controller, no problems at all. My first try at an F1 official game, but I know how to play driving sims:+ Intro to Game (gets my adrenaline going before a race starts)+ Graphics (great for 2012)+ Execution (the accelerate and brake controls feel tight)+ Well thought out tutorial / entry into the game+ Cheap for an F1 game, these games are stubburn in pricing. Only costs £3 ish in sale+ Lots of achievements+/- I didnt like that brake assist was on, automatically. was a bit freaky to have the game brake for me but a great option        for children thoughHavent found any negatives so far, its what i expected, and it delivered it well. I'm a happy customer. For what I paid (£2.75) 10/10			"

												Overall its a great game especially if you have tetris instead of PC, Its hard, even at easiest levels its still hard and very very frustrating. Its extremely challengeing, and very rewarding. The longer you play the better you will understand the physics of your car. Then when you change it, it starts all over again :)This is the cheap way of getting to know a lot about F1 in general, before every race in real life I spin 20ish laps on the track to be sure to remember every corner, watching the real race after that is much much better and more understandable.The only con I see is trouble with online multiplayer, it does not work for me. All in all 10/10, my favorite raceing sim, and guys if you are not cheating, first time you win the race in career, you will feel extremely good and proud :)			"

												An entertaining F1 game, that brings you the intensity of a F1 race and the graphics to back it up. Although, the unaware A.I. and the infuriatingly broken penalty system keep this game from being a top tier racer. ~7.9/10Pros:-Good Co-Op Career-Graphics are good-Physics and feel of the cars are goodCons:-A.I.-Damage System-Penalty SystemAll in all, a fun and competitive racing game.

												Does it add lots to the previous years instalment? Not particularly. The game does feel considerably snappier though. Some issues like the AI still being a little stupid can be irksome, but such minor complains will not stop you liking the game. If you like driving games buy it while its on sale, if you follow F1 and don't already have this game buy it NOW.			"

												A good game but the penalty sistem is really annoying! It gives penaltys to the player for minor incidents and other cars are forgiven for bumping you hard. And the pit exit of some tracks is bugged because the game gives a penalty for crossing the pit-lane line, when the car is still controlled by the AI. I have to save rewinds for that moment for not, my race is going down hard. These kind of issues are gamebreaking, at least for me, but overall i recommend the game for the fans of F1 (if they can pass over little flaws)!!!			"

												I've enjoyed every minute of the game so far. And this is coming from someone who isn't a die-hard fan of F1. It appeals to the casual gamer as well. It's not arcady, but still thoroughly enjoyable.Pros:Great graphicsAwesome soundVery good ambience feelAddictive gameplayVariety of challenges in case you want a break from the Career modeCons:Could do with a lesser percentage of Race Length option - Currently, the minimum is 25% which takes around 25-30 mins for a single race to complete in Career mode. Having a 15% option wouldn't be a such a bad idea.Manual pit lane handling - AI taking control as soon as you enter the pits can be avoided as well. Perhaps having an option to turn that off/on would be great Perhaps needs a bit more commentary during a raceI had to really think hard for the above three points (none of them gamebreaking) which to me is an indication of how much I love playing this game. Deservedly gets 8/10 in my books.			"

The sense of speed while you're flying down the straight at Monoco is unmatched, and the sound of the engine whirring behind you is immersive matched with a good pair of headphones. I play it with a G27, and without many adjustments, the wheel feels just right in your hand. All of this bundled up in one beautiful looking package, is F1 2012			"

												What an incredible racing game and this is coming from someone who didn't appreciate F1.The graphics are pretty even by 2016's standard.At first I couldn't compete in qualifying against AI which put me in the last position consistently. Then I started to learn the tracks better and I began to improve in qualifying sessions. 19th out of 24, 18th, 7th, then eventually 1st and 2nd!! The reward feeling is incredible as you win your races.In career mode you have to also master your race strategy which means knowing which tire set to choose and when to go to pit. Temperatures of brakes and tires are simulated so if they are cold you will find yourself sliding in corners.As I started to do well in dry races, I encountered another challenge in the dynamic weather. When it gets from sunshine to rain, you need to time your pit wisely to change tire set. New tires are cold and take time to adjust to the rythm of racing so you can't just push your car mindlessly. I struggled bad when weather turns from dry to wet until I learned when to pull a pit stop and to watch out for the temperatures of both my brakes and tires.Again, this is a beautiful F1 game that's pretty with immersive sound effects. You can feel the competitiveness from the AI. Whoever coded the AI deserves a medal!Buy this even if you just have a slight interest in F1.UPDATE July 13th 2016After I bought F1 2013 which is deemed by many to be the best F1 title from Codemasters yet, I'm loving F1 2012 even more. While F1 2013 is a bit prettier than F1 2012, it suffers from water spray not being shown in replays. I often record my games and post the videos on Youtube as a personal album of sort and this water spray bug bugs me very much especially from an F1 title vaunted very much to be the best yet from Codemasters. F1 2013 AI is also much tougher and I simply cannot keep up with the AI. In races where I could get into podium in F1 2012, I must settle with 5th-6th place instead in F1 2013. Some people may like the tougher AI but not me. Thus, F1 2012 is very much the more accessible game. As for the vaunted handling of F1 2013, I found it to be an overstatement. Cars in F1 2013 may be more twitchy at slow speeds but that doesn't necessarily make them more realistic....only more difficult to control at slow speeds. High speed handling in F1 2013 is on par with F1 2012 if not slightly more arcade (easier to drive). I regret buying F1 2013 at full price in fact because of the marginal value it has over F1 2012 which I bought for very cheap. Aside from the lackluster DLCs F1 2013 has no obvious edge over F1 2012. Certainly nothing to justify buying it at full price considering Codemasters has maintained the F1 2013 at full price for 2 years without any discount whatsoever being offered.Here's a little comparison between F1 games that I own:F1 2012: Great value, great handling physics, capable but not overwhelming AI (AI is at the sweetest spot imo), a minor bug in helmet visor texture, still looks good for 2016's standard, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound and you get to race as or with Michael Schumacher (2012 is his final racing year)F1 2013: Bad value since it's not been discounted for couple years now, at slow speeds the cars are more twitchy while at higher speeds the cars feel a tiny bit more arcade than F1 2012, rather overwhelming AI that can shock new players, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, a bit prettier than F1 2012, cars have V8 engine with awesome sound though there's no longer Michael Schumacher in the game, DLCs allow you to race in 1980s and 1990s F1 cars although the track and team lists are lacking.F1 2014: Good value when discounted, handling is quite a bit more arcade compared to previous iterations and suffers from understeer, good AI that's not as overwhelming as F1 2013, bug: AI water spray isn't being shown in replay, prettier than F1 2013, all teams are unlocked from the start in career mode so you don't have to start in a low tier team, has unlimited replay option that alleviates any worry of you ruining a race due to short lapses of concentration, cars have new turbocharged V6 engine with underwhelming sound...

												     Now I'm not that into the F1 yearly game thing, but my god is this game fun. At first it was the most difficult thing in the world because learning how to do it was completely new to me. I just had no clue on how to do it and would be doing pretty bad. Then I slowly got better and boy is it satisfying to start to win things.     This game makes the racing and winning so enjoyable! Normally in the Dirt series the winning just doesn't feel great but in this game it feels like I accomplished something. This is pretty much the biggest reason why I am reccomending this game.			"

												This is perhaps the best racing game I have ever played. When I did bother to play it online with others, it was fairly easy to find racers and get some laps in. However I enjoy the single player aspects of it having found the scalable AI a sufficient and fair challenge. The various career and quick race modes plus the ability to do time trials and take on a variety of challenge events makes this a well-rounded product that has great graphics and sound, and a very approachable driving model.

												I mainly raced against friends (and AI), and did a few season challenges (among which 1 in co-op). Most were 25% races; I only did a 100% race once. I'm no Formula 1 aficionados, but I immediately liked F1-2012. Challenging but yet simple, enjoyable from your couch with a controller, I liked the balanced mix between arcade and simulation. Fuel and tires management is not much but it adds a little strategy aspect, affecting pit stop in a fun and sometimes decisive way. I progressively removed the driving assists, and I had tons of fun improving my lap times. Winning then gives you great sense of accomplishment, like ""Look 'ma, no hands"". On the down-side, AI difficulty isn’t very progressive, amateur or intermediate are too easy for me, but pro is just out of my league. And the penalty system is another thing that may be improved. Anyhow, I still like to race a couple of tracks now and then. And win, of course.			"

Pros:+Well built, works nicely without FPS drops+All the circuits and cars are in, quite accurately modelled+Champions mode adds some trials which make the game not being just simple races+Yas Marina day-night transition+Quick online matchmaking (when there were players on it...)+Comfortable to play with gamepads and wheels, with a huge variety of compatible devicesAgainst:+Penalty system is so bad it's nearly a glitch itself, preventing from a proper race most of the times+You can only have one flat tyre at a time (?!)+Strange lighting. There are no lighting effects, colour is so vivid that becomes unreal and not natural. That's my point of view.+Curb spin really is a problem. Physics in this game are horribly made.+Young Drivers Test is boring to hell. Such a great idea, but they made it just wrong.+AI never makes mistakes. NEVER.+Damage system is a joke.+Small details (if you are a mad F1 nerd) are missing, like pit limiter, bit more immersive menus...+Safety car never appears, even if there is a massive shunt or pile-up.

												this games physics engine is really accurate, and the depth in the mechanics when customizing your car is really good. The only downside to this game is the sensitivity in the steering. PLayng this game on a keyboard can be a challange at times because you have to judge perfectly the point where the apex of the corner and the time to steer into that apex; if you are too soon, you will understeer, and if you are too late, you will oversteer the corner. This sensitivity makes streemlining difficult too, because its really hard to maintain the colinear motion behind the car in front. This sensitivity does however make the game a lot more chalanging, and makes the F1 car feel nimble and makes chicanes a lot of fun.			"

												In a world of mundain arcade like racing games with unrealistic controls, sloppy physics and horrendous AI, F1 2012 is a light in the dark. My first impression on this game was like many who look at racing titles with a unenthused ""Meh"". However, after devoting time to it, you'll easily see how great this title is. Whether you're using a controller or you're a hardcore sim racer using a steering wheel, you're find many hours of enjoyment in this. First and foremost, the graphics are stellar. If you have a machine which can handle the graphics, crank it up. You'll be blown away by the level of detail. Next for me is obviously the gameplay. You genuinely get the ""race car driver"" feeling as you race in search of that extra .1 second you know that you can take off of your qualifying time. You race to get your team on top, your name on top and to come out on top. You also feel like you're part of a team as your crew chief/engineer gives you track data as it pertains to you. If you've never played a racing title before, you may find the learning curve of the racing terminology to be pretty steep. You'll have to learn about KERS, DRS, prime tires, optimal tires, intermediate tires, wet tires, when to use them and also about fuel mixes which can help you save fuel by using less of it (at the cost of speed) or use more fuel which makes you go faster. All of which play into your general lap time and track position. One of the best things I love about this game is the AI. They're smart. They don't try to run you off the road but they're aggressive just like F1 drivers are. If you leave a gap on your inside before a turn, they'll slide in and take it. However, when you're coming up on lap traffic, they'll slow down and pull to the other side of the track to let you pass. You can really get into some close racing action on here. The one and only downside I can see is the difficulty level. It's hard to find a middle ground sometimes as you can find yourself running away from the field or find the field running away from you. The gap between Intermediate and Professional is quite large. In Intermediate you may qualify 1-2 seconds faster than the next car whereas in Professional you may find yourself 2-4 seconds off the pace. But, there's a lot of ways to get faster and they all involve playing the game and simply getting better at it! All in all, this a great game which I would recommend to anyone looking to have some close racing action. Easily an A+ in my books!			"

												If you're looking for a die-hard racing sim, this isn't it. However, the career mode is a ton of fun. I love setting up my car for each track, and I like the dynamic weather system they have in place. The game is a fun and rewarding experience. The only real issue I take with it, is that it is very easy to get penalties. Also, the handling isn't quite up to snuff when compared to true racing sims like Assetto Corsa and iRacing. The career mode is a ton of fun though, and I would highly recommend it.			"

												Great racing game. Very good support for the force feedback racing wheel, the Logitech Driving Force GT. Although it always needs some tweaking, since every game seems to handle this hardware differently. Really like how you can start with easy AI oponnents and gradully make it harder. Same goes for the driving aids, just love how you are in control of your own learning curve. And that you can set the balance of your own mastery and finding the flow that suits your personal driving style: arcade, arcade / sim, or leaning to a complete sim.Wheather effects are very good, if you have your setup right you really get the experience of the extreme changes F1 racers can go through in a race. Formidable game that's really worth every penny. The game also helped me to understand the F1 sport better, so I enjoy watching the races more and more.			"

												Graphics are nice enough, controls after tuning are fine too.If you enjoy timetrials (90% of my playtime) and chasing yourself you will have fun.However carreer mode ...The AI is really really stupid and penalties are harsh. When it runs into you you will be punished (throttle limit for x amount of secs) despite having done nothing wrong and it continues as if nothing happened.Also I find that the rules are not applied correctly at all times, sometimes you will get no penalty for being in the grass with all fours, at other times you will get one (again limiter on throttle) while you are 100% sure that you had still one tire on the tarmac. I play in cockpit mode so I had a clear view on the front of my car at all times and I could repeat it while testing.TBH, I enjoyed '97 (PSX), '98 (PSX), 2001 (PC), 2006(PSII), and all other versions I have ever played much much more. If I had to choose between this version and 2006 on my PSII I would go for the latter (heck even 2001) any day of the week despite the graphics being dated a bit.I could suggest you try for yourself and make up your own mind and refund if needed but the game requires you to do all the tests before you get to drive races in career mode.Not sure if you will manage to get there within the two hour period as playtime included time to download and steam adds an hour (for some bizzare reason) when you go the the support section.Arcade mode is available from the start but is not representative of the 'real' game.See comments for more details about why it was not running for me at some point. ;)			"

												Look I'm not trying to give some big critical review here. I'm a casual racer. My favorite racing games are the Grand Turismo games on the Playstation consoles. I have the wheel that was designed for the 5th one on PS3. That game is awesome because I can just play it. But THIS GAME? No. Not so much. Maybe I'm just a novice, but I just can't even get past the first track on career mode. I use my wheel with this game and the cars are VERY twitchy. I've sat and tweeked the heck out of the wheel. I've gone to various forums looking for advice others have given on the best settings and tried those. And just when I thought I had the track down no less, which takes a lot of patience and time I might add, the AI just destroyed me; leaving myself wondering, ""How in the heck can I drive this much better with this game?!"" Oh and its not like I have it on Hard or anything. It's on the default AI setting. What was really sad to me was I did not notice a difference in how the cars handled when I pulled out my Xbox 360 controller to play this game. Dare I say it might make driving the cars a little easier? I don't know, but I know as much as I try to really like this game I just can't. I had more fun playing the Formula 1 games released on the first playstation. I had more fun playing the old Sierra NASCAR games on PC back in the day. You know why? It was because the controlls for the cars were easy to learn, and easy to use! The cars WEREN'T TWITCHY! Whenever I would break and then veer into a turn, I DIDN'T SPIN OUT like I do at least a few times per race in this game! This game is NOT FUN. It feels like work every time I play it. When I play a racing game, I expect to be able to just load, play, and be competitive. Not spend days and days trying to master a track only to finish in the bottom half of the pack. Screw that. Screw this game.			"

												El último F1 decente que Codemasters pudo hacer. El balance entre los que juegan con teclado, controller o volante es muy reñido, por lo que hace que el juego sea competitivo. El lag es casi inexistente.. a diferencia del 2013; 14 y 15... "

												Is a good game for the hours put in was worth the £15 I paid for it at the time. I would reccomend buying a newer game though as the controls in the later versions are improved.Ideal if you'd prefer to play with that seasons drivers and cars though, however there are mods available for later versions to do this.Still a good buy, but buy it cheap!

												F1 2012 is not a game worth purchasing over the likes of F1 2013, 2014 or 2016. I'm not going to talk about how it was worth purchasing at the time, just what it is now and what it is now, is a game that's cornered by all other ones that do everything better than it.When I played this on PS3, I was a very bad-to-average driver. It was the last of the 5 old-gen games I bought on PS3, so I could compare it to all the others.The handling is very unrewarding on controller, and nothing special on a wheel. When I was really bad at the game, I found it frustratingly difficult to drive consistently and at speed, because of the way you could exit a corner and the car would switch ends with little warning.When I got better at the game, I still didn't know any limits of the car and it wasn't fun.Graphics really were the definition of eh. Overall, they were quite good for the era, and a solid stamp in the generation of these games, but it looked bland and had a few share of glitches too.There is no Expert AI, meaning there is only 4 AI difficulties, all vastly spread in speed. Finding the optimum AI for your pace is difficult. The aggression of them is possibly the lowest of all members of the franchise, similiar to 2014.Career mode lost the paddock of the previous 2 editions, and just has the same features of the next 2 peices by Codemasters. Nothing special to be seen here.As for all other singleplayer content, the addition of the YDT, Season Challenge and Champions Mode was welcome, however 2014 and particularly 2013 (with the classics) does these things better.Engine sounds are the worst of the lot, painful to listen to in my opinion. The damage model is identical to all those around it.Online was quite good however with minimal lag and the ranking programme, moderately tarnished by the woeful penalty system. No one plays it anymore though.The benefits of playing now on PC are, of course, graphics and modding. The graphics are solid again, and it's quite possibly the easiest-to-run game of the series with these, but again, nothing special.Modding is more open than it's 2 predecessors but less than it's 2 successors. You could probably guess that to be fair.Pros:Easy to RunGood OnlineFun if you have none of the other gamesRelatively Cheap on SaleOkay Driving PhysicsModerate Mod SupportCons:Bad Penalty SystemNo Damage Model AlterationsTorrid Engine SoundNot Enough Mods on the InternetBelow Average AIDoes Nothing SpecialValue For Money?Do not buy this game if it is not on sale. £14.99 is humourous. When it goes on sale, I'd only buy it if you own no other ones or if you want to just finish your collection.It's not really a bad game, just at this moment in time there is no real reason to buy it. In 4 words:'It does nothing special.'			"

												I'm a casual racing fan (ride motorcycles and offroad, but this is a different animal) that plays anything from sims to arcade racers like N4S to Dirt Rally, Ride, Motogp, Mxgp, Mx vs ATV, Insane, Trackmania, Grid Autosport and Project Cars.I picked this up on sale and this is a decent game, graphics are a bit dated and only one form of braking, no e-brake for sharper turns or anything. If interested in Formula-1 I would say go with 2013-2014 for a bit more, but you can get some fun out of this still. Its certainly not the best racing game on the market but if you catch a sale it can be worthy of some time.			"

												F1 2012 is the best F1 simulator there is! You can really feel the difference in every way between driving a Red Bull and a Marussia and in between. The simulation under changeable weather conditions only makes this game even better and more realistic. It is a must have for every F1 fan in the world. The only downside to this game are the pit stops. I personally really wish the pit stops were more interactive and not simply a drive and pit scenario.			"

												F1 2012 looks a good game but when your start your career the probelms start to show. the biggest issue I have with this game the penalty system, first corner of every race the cars are fighting for every place trying not hit other cars and a ILLEGAL BLOCKING penalty comes on the screen then comes the A.I behind and hits you forcing another penalty of CAUSING A COLLISION, you can't avoid it unless you just let all the cars get through the first corner with you waiting in last. Bad points*Career mode doesn't last long enough*A.I never get punished*Handling of the cars (once your in a spin iy has gone spin your the wrong way, everytime)*Flags and penalty system*Young driver test a the beginning of the game( time wasting, pointless part of the game)good points* The graphics are very good* Online co-op season is fun* Career mode, starting with a small team and working your upI would recommend you avoid this game no matter how cheap it is in the sale.Rating 4/10			"

												I read somewhere that this game is the biggest waste of money and it is true.The AI of the game is just horrible: if it cannot take over it will just crash with you immediately. Not to mention that rule system of the game: the developers just missed the point. The game will punish immediately by time punishment or invalid lap once you leave track, even if noone is around. If an NPC contacts you the player gets punished not the NPC. The team dispatcher does not tell if any rain is coming though it lets you change your tires to dry when the rain is already falling. Fun fact: I got punished because I left the track...TO THE PIT!!! :@To summarize my opinion the developers should pay me for paying this piece of sh*t. F1 deserves a better game that means fun and entertainment not infinite raging after I got punished repeatedly.			"

												Fantastic racing, great precision control and excellent AI responses. At first though, had almost no control using my joystick and thought the game was terrible, then discovered the steering wheel assist button was on, so switched it off and suddenly had full and precise control - it was a mega moment. Worst thing about this game is the rediculous penalties - unless you start on pole, it is very difficult to get through the first few corners without getting a penalty. You can restart, but the game should be more forgiving, especially when it is blatently the AI's fault. Another slightly annoying thing was when in career mode, I accepted an offer to drive for Mclaren. I replaced Hamilton, but he didn't move to another team, he just wasn't in F1 anymore. I understand the commercial logic in preventing us changing the driver and team names, but it is warped logic. Teams change drivers mid-season sometimes and we should be able to edit those sort of things. In GP3 I had a full editing package and could change virtually everything, even horsepower, but I still purchased GP4. Tracks change, cars change, we F1 fans would upgrade when we could afford to. For now though, I just enjoy racing a few years old championship. Wonderful graphics and great racing. Despite the complaints, I am still a happy racer. 9/10.			"

												Just like the previous titles from Codemasters, F1 2012 brings you the intensity of a F1 race with improved graphics and physics, but with a completly unaware A.I. and broken penalty system that make this game feel more a step back over the previous interactions.The good:- Co-Op Career- Graphics- Physics and Overall feel of the enginesWorst:-A.I.-Penalty SystemIt still is a good game for F1 fans or racing fans in general, but the suposed improved penalty system, just end up breaking the pace and making things frustranting when the AI seem doesnt have awereness enough on most cases, but its the user that end up with penalties after the race.

												If your looking for a challenging racing game with intelligent AI, great physics, and a wide variety of difficulty settings to play around with (ABS, TracCon, tire options, etc.)  This game is a blast.  There's enough play in the settings to make your race as arcadey or as a real as possible.  After playing this game, I now have a better understanding of how F1 racing works, and the rules behind it.  I cannot wait for 2013, but I will get it on a sale.  This is the Forza of F1 racing, minus customization.  I'd rather have Forza or Gran Turismo tho.			"

												If you are a F1- fan, like me. You`ll love this game. Just add a steering wheels and you have the perfect setup. Nothing more is neccesary. (8/10)Although I don`t reccomend buying this Now. Since 2013`s season is out now.			"

												I've never owned any of the previous F1 games by Codemaster and I bought this game just of curiosity to see how it plays. After spending so much in open wheelers across various simracing titles I was pleasantly surprised by how fun this game actually is. The driving model feels familiar to me from sim titles, the AI can provide one hell of a challenge, the inclusion of career mode and generally plently of features across the boards make F1 2012 great and enjoyable title for all fans of open wheel racing and racing in general. Highly recommended.However, if you're thinking about playing this game with a wheel, avoid the default FFB like a plague. It's a piece of ♥♥♥♥. On RaceDepartment you can find so much better settings that what Codemasters offers. The difference is night and day. I was about to give up on this titles until I discovered that.			"

												Probably the best F1 they have done so far, 2012 is smooth fast and complicated with most of the modern functionality of the current series f1 cars. The game itself feels really solid, runs fantasticly on my system even at max graphics at 5760 wide resolution across 3 monitors.Id recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games as the multiple modes allows all skill levels to get in and give it a go. Unfortunately nobody races online. I regularly jump into multiplayer and its a ghost town which is a shame considering this is one of the only modern racers thats actually finished and can be considered a realistic racing sim.			"

												Okay, I realise this review is pretty much useless considering F1 2013 is out, and 2014 is coming soon. However, since 2012, 13 and 14 are basically the same game with updated rosters and new tracks, you might want to get the cheaper option with 2012. I'm still playing this now and enjoying it. The gameplay is marvelous, and I'm not really bothered it's not a full simulator; it has a good natural feel to it. The assists mean you can enjoy it regardless of skill level. As a racing game veteran, I play with all assists off, and its challenge is what I enjoy.The cheapest option of all the modern F1 games, I would recommend buying it for a couple of pounds (or your regional equivalent) in a sale.

												If you can get this game on sale (just got it for 5 bucks/sale continues until Monday 10/26 some time) and have an older F1 game or want an introduction to F1, it's well worth it. I personally wouldn't pay 20 bucks (I never pay 20 bucks for anything), but put it on your Wishlist and get it on sale if you miss this one. Or pay 20 bucks if you really want it; at least it's not $60. Fun and has a great Easy setting if you're not a hard core driving gamer (medium and hard settings as well, and plenty of driving assists you can turn off, so it's highly tuneable). I wish it had a practice mode instead of just re-running your qualifing lap over and over, but it's a small quibble for a bargain game.			"

This game is even better than its predecessor, at first I thought handling was problematic, but actually I realised that it simply has more realistic physics, you just need to steer gently, not like crazy monkey in F1 2011. Graphics are great, a little bit disappointed with the soundtrack as it doesn't have actual songs played in the paddock, multiplayer is competetive, new interesting game modes.

												If your looking for a challenging racing game with intelligent AI, great physics, and a wide variety of difficulty settings to play around with (ABS, TracCon, tire options, etc.)  This game is a blast.  There's enough play in the settings to make your race as arcadey or as a real as possible.  After playing this game, I now have a better understanding of how F1 racing works, and the rules behind it.  I cannot wait for 2013, but I will get it on a sale.  This is the Forza of F1 racing, minus customization.  I'd rather have Forza or Gran Turismo tho.			"

												F1 2012 is the racer's racing game. I've been looking for a sim racer like this among the throngs of arcade-y racers out there. It's not the gruelling sim like a Gran Turismo, but this hits a sweet spot between hardcore and casual appeal. It's got plenty of style to boot, and I think it captures that tense ""race day"" atmosphere.			"

												One of the better racing games I've played in a long time, and something that I cannot seem to stop playing! The career mode is extremely compelling - you want to improve in order to finish that place higher, to get onto the podium and to get the better contract for next year. The weather and track effects are very good. The handling of the car feels completely different on the dry, damp and wet track, and it takes practise to master them all (especially the wet!). The physics of the car feel satisfying, with the modifications you make to the tuning having a real difference that you can immediately feelSadly the penalty system is borked, which can be annoying. It's very frustrating when the game wrongly gives you a drive through penalty, ruining an otherwise perfect race and dropping you back down the field. Apart from this gripe, it's a game I would thoroughly recommend picking up, especially if you have an interest in F1			"

												It does take a learning curve if you want to get really technical but you can go low brow technical and still have a great time. You do need to learn and understand the different tracks. There are still a few minor bugs which can occasionally cause you to throw a race (Abu Dhabi seems to be the standout for me) but otherwise pretty flawless. Avoiding penalties in the first lap can be hard and for the beginner intensely frustrating but with practise you can eventually avoid them. The only bugbear I have which stops me giving it a ten is the one aspect of the penalty system which penalises you if you have a collision but if some clown AI driver knocks you out they seem to get away scot free which hardly seems fair. The only way to avoid this is be really careful in the turns and stay as far away as you can from the other drivers. But apart from that it`s just a blast especially in career mode which really makes you feel a sense of achievement when you do well in a race or even better get offered a contract with a big team. Hours of fun and well worth the purchase price!			"

												Best F1 game I've played in many many years. The music composed by Ian Livingstone adds A LOT to the experience, worth giving it a listen. The ""champions mode"" also adds some replayability (since I don't have much time for full-length races)			"

												Probably the best F1 they have done so far, 2012 is smooth fast and complicated with most of the modern functionality of the current series f1 cars. The game itself feels really solid, runs fantasticly on my system even at max graphics at 5760 wide resolution across 3 monitors.Id recommend this game to anyone that enjoys racing games as the multiple modes allows all skill levels to get in and give it a go. Unfortunately nobody races online. I regularly jump into multiplayer and its a ghost town which is a shame considering this is one of the only modern racers thats actually finished and can be considered a realistic racing sim.			"

												If you can get this game on sale (just got it for 5 bucks/sale continues until Monday 10/26 some time) and have an older F1 game or want an introduction to F1, it's well worth it. I personally wouldn't pay 20 bucks (I never pay 20 bucks for anything), but put it on your Wishlist and get it on sale if you miss this one. Or pay 20 bucks if you really want it; at least it's not $60. Fun and has a great Easy setting if you're not a hard core driving gamer (medium and hard settings as well, and plenty of driving assists you can turn off, so it's highly tuneable). I wish it had a practice mode instead of just re-running your qualifing lap over and over, but it's a small quibble for a bargain game.			"

												Hello everyone,Although there are a couple of weeks left for release of F1 2014, f1 2012 is still my best option to play as a student ahahah. I love Formula 1 in general and I love playing f1 games, I always seek for reality in career mode where I can't be higher than 5th place normally with Toro Rosso but in the career mode all AI Drivers go off track in certain turns in Malaysia, Bahrain, Spain, Canada and Valencia (sometimes). How can I solve this thing? I already verified the integrity of cahce twice			"

												Όποιος επιθυμήσει να έρθει για πρώτη φορά σε επαφή με τον κόσμο της F1, θα αποκτήσει ένα παιχνίδι που εξακολουθεί να χρήζει πολλών βελτιώσεων και παρουσιάζεται διχασμένο. Από τη μία κάνει σοβαρά πισωγυρίσματα (πρόβλημα με safety car, λανθασμένες επιβολές ποινών, αφαίρεση Grand Prix mode), από την άλλη προσπαθεί (βελτιώσεις σε πίστες, θετικές αλλαγές στο career mode) να αποτελέσει ένα σωστό βήμα προς το F1 2013, το οποίο και ελπίζουμε να είναι επιτέλους εκείνο το άρτιο F1 game που περιμένουμε εδώ και χρόνια να δούμε από την Codemasters.http://www.ragequit.gr/reviews/item/f1-2012http://www.ragequit.gr/specials/item/f1-2012-total-mod-rebuild "

												Understeer ... Understeer ... Understeer  ... and some bad CONTROLS issue ... with short words lolI guess it is better to play F1 2012 with Joypad, because game totally suck if you use Driving Wheel (you need to change wheel setting a lot to can make it to work well). For me F1 2011 was best in that way. You no need to change settings on your wheel.In general all other improves don't have so much means if you don't have good controls. :(Graphics ...          hmmmmm ... It is more light and maybe more good ... but just AA is not so good for me :(Gameplay is much better i think ...          Engineer talking have more means         Add Brake balance (i don't see a lot means .. lol )         AI are more hard to be beat         Car setup is more easy (quick car setup help a lot, if you are lazy to make own)         and all other old things ... whahahahhahahGame need some Patches and i hope CM to make it soon and to fix wheel settings.

												Whether it's fighting the car for top qualifying position for race day or keeping your cool during the big Race, F1 2012 is a great game for the formula 1 fanatic!This official licensed game brings your favourite team into your computer room. Whether it's battling the Red Bull team or overtaking the Mecedes F1 car, this will have you intrigued until you pass the finish line. Beginning the season with a team that supports your talent and working up to your favourite team is just the tip of the ice berg. Racing in different conditions with your chosen tires gives the player a more personalised feel to the game. Pole position awaits...Go McLaren..			"

NON mi dai il rango se arrivo primo e ho già il punteggio più alto delle persone che sono con me nella sessione  ....  NON cè la chat  se uno fa il coglione te lo devi subire per tutte le qualifiche e la gara  sei impotente su tutto ...!!!!!!!!!   Questo gioco è stato fatto per i coglioni delinquenti e farabutti che entrano e  distruggono tutto per il gusto di farlo ...  io ringraziando Dio faccio ancora parte di  quella fetta di amatori del gioco che corrono per divertimento anche se non sono forti , ma ce la mettono tutta per arrivare ..
