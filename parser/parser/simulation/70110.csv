												Having only barely known about ""hacking"" games, I decided to give it a shot, as this game was on sale for 2€. I found myself having mixed feelings about it, and writing a lot, so bear it with me. (skip to the last paragraph, above the PS, if in a hurry)Right off, you notice that the game doesn't support 16:9 or 16:10 resolutions and the text is small and hard to see, and nothing can be done about that. Still, I was intrigued and started playing. The intro of the story lacks a bit of depth and background, but you get the idea. The game is mainly played in a command-line console, with some other monitor screens that are the same throughout the game. Although the atmosphere is right (the music, though not brilliant, helps) the presentation is limited and repetitive, there's not much to see. Essentially, the gameplay is that of a slow paced puzzler where in each ""level"" you have to figure out the best way to complete the objectives (gain access to computers/systems, steal files/money, upload viruses/trojans, etc etc) by taking down security measures (passwords, encryption) in various nodes/computers in that screen, and also finding ""hidden"" ones. Each action raises your trace level; if it gets to 100% you get traced and loose. You’ll have to delete “footprints” of your activities and pay your ISP to reset your IP, etc, to manage that and avoid getting traced. It is very non-linear, you can never be sure what the best way to proceed is, and there are non-essential things you can do, which may or may not be to your advantage: for instance, you may find a link to new servers that have money to steal, but they can also have nothing of interest and only serve to increase your trace level. Also, you'll have to figure out if you'll risk spending money to upgrade your rig or save it to decrease the trace level when needed, which is always a tough choice. That said, progressing through the level and finding out what to do is mostly interesting, and the ""exploration"" involved actually makes you feel like you are ""unwrapping"" what happened, and helps telling the story and getting the plot forward.In the first two missions you have lots of help, which is nice if you start off without any knowledge about the series and/or command lines in general. In the third mission you’re more on your own, and that’s interesting. Then, I realized that your trace level sometimes carries from mission to mission (which was not explained), and you may find yourself in a situation where you raised it too high or didn’t get enough money on previous levels to have “room to breathe” to complete the next one. If that’s the case, all you can do is start from the very beginning of the game (!) which is extremely frustrating. There is no multiple save game slots, just the one! And there is no saving in the middle of a mission either! The fourth mission I found VERY difficult because of this. Then, on the fifth one, EVEN MORE DIFFICULT, I finally managed to proceed, but disregarding some “instructions” that were provided which supposedly I should have followed to get to the next level, which was a little confusing!! But apparently, there's (always?) more than one way to get past the level(s?). So, one can safely say the game is challenging and difficult.All this would still be ok, but the ending, let's just say, is just very abrupt, anti-climatic and unsatisfying. It's really a pity, I mean it wouldn't hurt to write some more lines of text and close the story properly...In short, the game has some fun if you like the hacking/command-line thing, but it is very a challenging game. Maybe that's part of the point of the game, but with the poor presentation, being repetitive, having a very bad ending, and sometimes being extremely punishing by making you start from the very beginning, I fear that unless you are very passionate about IT/hacking and also like very hard puzzles, it will more likely frustrate you than provide you with fun.(PS: comparing with the original game (Hacker Evolution), though, this one is better. Not going much into it, the previous one is even more punishing with some game-breaking flaws in the mechanics, imo. After finishing this one and playing a little of the first one, I find myself surprisingly cheering for this one. So, all things considered, if you want to try one, I recommend trying this one rather than the original.)			"

												This game, as all the other hacker evolution games, has such a slim margin of error that even getting through the tutorial in one piece will test your threshold for handling frustration. The hacker evolution games have a strong foundational concept, and solid UI, but the game suffers from arbitrary limitations (like the amount of times that you can use any computer as a hop point.) Typically, I like to give games the benefit of the doubt. Try it out if it's on sale, I usually say, but there's no point in putting down any amount of money for such a frustrating game such as any installment of the hacker evolution series.			"

  You'll Enjoy This Game If You Like:   Movie Style Hacking   The colour green   Text based games   High difficulty First off, this is not a game for the faint hearted - it has a very steep difficulty curve and you will need to put in some time to understand things. Put it this way I actually managed to fail the tutorial twice. This can avoided by really reading everything properly! It will also probably make sense to have a notepad alongside you so you can remember the difference between commands especially decrytpt and crack.The game is also not very forgiving as one mistake further on into a level can mean you need to start over. But once you accept this and you get over the difficulty hurdles, the game is great and strangely gives you sense of the whole thing being real which does make it exciting.There is no great difference between this and the original Hacker Evolution besides slightly more of a focus on the puzzle aspect.Enjoy hacking and don't give up too easily.

												The creativity in HE: Untold is more well developed, compared to the original Hacker Evolution, and the storyline is ok, to a point - then the storyline just gets dropped on the floor, and the game ends.Can i recommend it? Possibly, the cmd-based game style appeals to me, aswell as the storyline along the way.Will i recommend it? No, i will not! In a matter of 10 missions (tutorial included) the game will end, way too short!I would rather sit back with Street Hacker (same cmd-based style), or back to Uplink, and enjoy myself with something longer-lasting than this..Oh yeah, let's not forget the hardcore DLC, which introduces another 2 missions (yeah, only 2) - is it even worth bothering?

												Asinine game design:Complete all level objectives, including obtaining $2000 and reducing global trace level below 50%.  Continue playing.  Accrue more than $5000 and spend money on huge firewall upgrade.  Use large trace level buffer to hack hidden (bonus) servers.  Exhaust all options on this level and attempt to progress to next; cannot.  Hit F2 and review level objectives again.  Objectives for obtaining money and reducing trace level are now marked incomplete.  Cannot progress because elected to spend acquired resources on better equipment and use low trace level for server exploration.  Punished for playing too well.  Refuse to replay 30-minute level; uninstall.Play Street Hacker and mess around with mods for Uplink instead.  Please someone make a truly amazing new hacking game.			"

												A crappy knockoff of Uplink, a far superior, better engineered, and more compelling game.  Don't waste your time even thinking about this game, just get Uplink.If you must play through it, be prepared for unintuitive mechanics, a useless tutorial, and overly complicated visuals, which, while they make for great screenshots, only get in the way during gameplay.

												Unfortunately, the excellent level design of Hacker Evolution and Hacker Evolution: Reinsertion are not to be found throughout this sequel. The developer decided to make a couple of the levels overly convoluted and unnecessarily complicated for no good reason whatsoever. In Untold, it is as if one is put through a couple tedium and boredom filled levels as a form of punishment or through lack of design creativity. There is simply no enjoyment to be extracted from these exercises. These two levels are not fun, interesting, nor rewarding. It feels more like taking irrelevant and needless tests for nothing. The music in Untold is not nearly as amusing and entertaining to listen to during play as in the original game. The songs selected are bland, uninspired, and repetitive in comparison.Despite its level design problems, Untold still manages to be more developed and better executed than Uplink, but it remains a poor comparison to the original Hacker Evolution. Once you get past the two inferior levels, the rest of the game is enjoyable. Overall 6/10.			"

												This game is simply amazing, from the storyline to the advaced and simple to use edior program that come with the purchase of the game. This game challenges my mind more than any other game I have ever owned. The terminology is suprisingly correct, you don't type stupid commands like ""hack facebook"" no, no. The interface of the game and how you type commands faintly feel like a linux OS. Don't think that this game is going to teach you how to hack into anything, but it does give you a perspective on how websites are designed and the security flaws within them.  I have to say though, it is very much like the original HE just a different design, but same layout. Pros: Challenging Unique (The only game on steam store with hack in it)Many hours of gameplay (endless if you decide to create your own levels) heartpumping strategic Cons: extremely  slow loading times on the options screen and new level screen (I think it's because this game was orginally designed for linux and mac)   "

												Just like with the base version, if you don't mind staring at a plain, Unix-type interface and entering keyboard commands -- and you want to begin to learn how to hack computers and steal things -- then this game might be for you. Personally, I tired of it fairly quickly. Not exactly exciting gameplay.  But, could be appropriate for others if you enjoy this kind of challenge (I recommend, however, that you spend your time learning to progam rather than learning to hack, which will just get you into trouble eventually...).(Note: Acquired via a bundle)			"

												Hacker Evolution – Untold is pretty much the same game as the previous hacker evolution but with slightly added gameplay mechanics and a different storyline. While Hacker Evolution – Untold’s story is a lot more relatable, it was also quite boring. The scenarios were much more realistic and as a result feel less grand than the first one. The ending was just flat out ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on many levels, absolutely terrible closure. The levels feel way overdrawn for no reason whatsoever, and by the end it just feels like you are doing chores rather than playing a puzzle game. You can tell the developers were running out of creative ideas for running a hacking simulation game. Overall this game is a poor sequel to the first.			"

												You're an IT specialist contacted by someone warning you about a spy in your company. Guided by a mysterious person, you're being framed by them - it's up to you to reveal themselves so that your name is cleaned...The plot is the prequel to Hacker Evolution, showing how you came to be a reclused person on an island. However, the end is kinda abrupt. The last level is so easy that it's just a shame that the developers didn't put the work they did for the entire game.The gameplay isn't differing from the previous game, so allow me to copy/paste part of the evaluation I've written.Hacker Evolution: Untold is perhaps a writing simulator, as you need to type the command but you need your brains to avoid to be traced and to have a game over. Sometimes, you'll need to begin a new campaign because you can't do anything but try a different manner to avoid spending too much money you've ""stolen"" or to add to your trace level. That's perhaps the most frustrating thing in HE:U.You're going to read files, find passwords, find exploit files that will make your life easier, crack, decrypt, use your brains to know how many hosts you need, upgrade your hardware (should I add a faster modem or a better firewall or more CPU Ram?).Now, the product is stable, there was a time where exosyphen messed up with keyboards (mainly AZERTY) but they're really listening to their customers.For the graphics, they're simple: a map, a console, your config and messages. While you don't have choice in the matter of customizing the interface, I must say that the green one isn't bad all all.The best point for this game is the soundtrack, very electro/dance but very fitting. I loved it. I really loved it.Hacker Evolution: Untold comes with Flight Zero, three more levels to enjoy.While many will whine about how it's not realistic as hacking game, I'll say: I don't care about realism. I just want to enjoy myself. However, back then, the game had a breaking bug. I've written to exosyphen, like suggested, and they offered me the DRM version so that I could play the entire game. Since then, the bug disappeared, as I could write my solution.The game is worthy, so go for it!			"

												The game does a pretty good job at creating a hacking world, but is flawed in ways that ruin the fun. The gameplay reminds me of Uplink. In some ways I like this game better because the hacking is focused around fewer more specific actions. Things I didn't like: The global trace score is very confusing. It seems like most actions I take cause my trace to increase, despite bouncing my connection and finishing my hacks. The fact that this carries over from level to level means that poor performance in the beginning of the game can make later levels more difficult. I don't want to redo earlier levels to try to make later levels easier. Since resources like money and bounced connections are so limited, I found myself without enough money to finish the level I was in. It wasn't clear whether I should keep trying to hack or if I was really stuck. It's a cool looking game, but flawed.			"

												A low budget indie game, and sadly it clearly shows. Poor puzzle design, confusing clues, and a bare-bones interface consisting of text and stock photos. It's very easy to become permanently stuck due to your money and trace levels frequently carrying across levels, and I did a few levels into my first playthrough. Take a pass on this one.			"

												Hacker Evolution is a beautiful game of the series. But there is a lot of difficulty stage. Game do not recommend it because it is not HD and supports video modes.

												This is a pretty fun simulation/puzzle game. The hacker interface is pretty cool, I like to play puzzle games with some good music in the background like some Drum and base. tho the music on this game is ok but tends to get a lil annoying. Wish it had more of an up to date music list lol But its not much of an issue. But for 2 bucks i cant complain. Tho the instructions can get a lil confusing at times but with time and patience you will conquer. The game gives you a basic understanding of taking the role of a hacker and strategizing your way to make it trough to survive and not get traced or killed.  Not much of a story to this game but the concept is pretty cool.  I recomend the game to anybody who likes a good puzzle soving game and strategize and has alo of patience. Give it a try.			"

												[7/10]This is closest you will get in a game to real hacking (of course a way simpler than real life). The game lacks visuals, but the atmosphere is ok, the missions are interesting, finding the hidden servers is fun, but game is way too short. There's an expansion campaign but it is much harder than the standard campaing, so don't even bother playing the expansion if you didn't finish the standard one. Since there are actually no other games like this one, it's worth owning and playing if you're interesting in hacking, specially for 10$. It won't last much but it's an interesting concept and fun to play.			"

												Unfortunately, the excellent level design of Hacker Evolution and Hacker Evolution: Reinsertion are not to be found throughout this sequel. The developer decided to make a couple of the levels overly convoluted and unnecessarily complicated for no good reason whatsoever. It is not a matter of these couple levels actually being challenging. On the contrary. They have proven to being the exact opposite of anything resembling of fun and intuitive. In Untold, it is as if one is put through a couple tedium and boredom filled levels as a form of punishment or through lack of design creativity. There is simply no enjoyment to be extracted from these two exercises. These two levels are not fun, interesting, nor rewarding. It feels more like taking irrelevant and needless tests for nothing. The music in Untold is not nearly as amusing and entertaining to listen to during play as in the original game. The songs selected are bland, uninspired, and repetitive in comparison. I could barely notice the difference between each song. Another bad change in comparison to the original is that the game does not make use of a wide screen view. Instead, it has placed black bars on each side. As far as I have noticed, only one new command (""deletelogs"") has been added to the user's repertoire, and that only adds to the general feeling of doing errands in order to proceed. It is a shame that the badly designed levels are utterly unreasonable and joyless, since parts of the game offers truly fun levels that accompany a nice storyline, continuing the original's saga. Despite its level design problems, Untold still manages to be more developed and better executed than Uplink, but it remains a poor comparison to the original Hacker Evolution. Once you get past the two inferior levels, the rest of the game is enjoyable. As for the Flight Zero expansion, it is completely broken and cannot be played past the first level due to bugs. This can be confirmed through the official Steam forum for the game. As of this writing, there are no signs that the expansion will be patched into working condition. Sadly, Untold appears to have been rushed and is clearly uninspired, and Flight Zero is blatantly unfinished. This is almost disastrous, since the original game and original expansion were such wonderful examples of this rare genre. Perhaps Untold's biggest disappointment besides the level design flaws, is the weak ending. This is yet another poorly executed aspect of the game that showcases how overly uninspired Untold is in comparison to its predecessor from the same exact developer. The last level and ending are so pitiful and neglected, that it serves merely as a confirmation of the all-around lesser quality in comparison to the original. I hope the developer can pick up the pieces from this developmental stumble and improve upon the original for the sequel. It took me about 8 hours to complete the base game. The Flight Zero expansion could not be played due to game breaking bugs.Hacker Evolution: Untold is okay.			"

												You read my recommendation for Hacker Evolution? Well, that's pretty much Hacker Evolution: Untold. Everything's green now, instead of golden-brown, and you get some more interesting screens than the world map this time. There's also the added ""deletelogs"" command, which kills half your trace from a given server for zero cost. The last couple levels are a complete joke if you've built up your computer at ALL over the course of the game, but other than that, it's all good. If you liked Hacker Evolution, this is more of the same - and I'm okay with that.			"

												I enjoyed pretty much HE, and liked HE Untold too.HEU has some more interesting features, like ability to reduce global trace by deleting logs, or easy rescan of a server with a right click on the map. The different gameplay stories are variable in interest, more or less original, easy and difficult. Finally I find the HE original story to be more imaginative.Also, some crash experienced with the mp3 music handled by the SDL libs, not yet completely fixed. Needed some tuning (see discussions) to bypass those. About 3 or 4 crashes in 16 hours of playtime, so you can progress in the game anyway. This was not the case with HE, using ogg music, very stable and never crashed. Definitely, HE and HEU are well immersive, and that would be a dream to get some really creative scenario, like Tom Clancy’s or Ken Follett’s! "

												A nice puzzle/optimization game. With limited resources (machines, money, computer parts) you have to find out which machines to hack in what order to reach the goals of the level.This is the hollywood type of ""hacking"", but is very consistent clear. Different length of encryption keys and passwords determine how long the hack takes and the number machines/firewalls between you and the target determine how fast you can be traced. Additionally you have to follow clues to find other machines at all.The game has okay graphics, but is mainly controled with a terminal/console. If you have a problem with command line tools this game is probably not for you. I personally liked this kind of control a lot.In contrast to Hacker Evolution Duality you don't have much time pressure and there is no hectic. The emphasis is on solving the problem, not on being fast enough.I am playing the game on Linux and in contrast to other reports (mostly Windows): For me the game never crashed.I only had a level where it wasn't clear what machines are part of the objective and why.Also: Steve's tips are not always the best way to do the level.
