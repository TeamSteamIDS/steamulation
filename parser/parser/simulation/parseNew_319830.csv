Early Access Review
								--REVIEW UPDATED AS OF 07/07/15--(click the ""recommended"" to see the screenshot thumbnails)Do you like arcade flight simulators? Think back to the great games in the genre: Ace Combat, Crimson Skies, Fury 3, Lylat Wars, YAGER; what would you like in a game like that?Do you want pretty? Pretty you'll have. While explosions don't have the best effects by far and environment textures could use some work, AX:EL is one of the prettiest flight games out there in light, colors and environment. The camera and the moving planes give also a great sense of action alongside with non-annoying but very nice touches like lens flares, glows, refraction and lots of tiny details like some destructible structures, flora and waves.

Do you want campaign? The ""Mercenary missions"" mode currently offers 10 missions that need to be unlocked progressively, with objectives varying from destroying squadrons, running search and rescue operations, transporting sensitive cargo through storms, and fighting huge boss-like enemies. While the number might seem a bit small, they are highly replayable, fairly long, include their selection of music (also composed by the author, really nice music, too.) and feature no lives, meaning you'll have to do them on one try, which adds to the difficulty but doesn't make them especially frustrating.Do you just want to shoot stuff down? The Arena mode features deathmatch and team deathmatch, both with customizable bots. It also has multiplayer support, but only ip-to-ip or LAN modes. AI can get pretty intense on the higher levels.Do you want customization? Every kill in either game mode, Arena or Mercenary, or Mercenary Mission completion, will earn you MsM. You can use that MsM to purchase a variety of body, weapon, wing or tail modules, with specific bonuses to each one.Do you want spectacle? Not only AX:EL's visuals will keep you engaged, the planes control really nicely, and the combat soon gets close and personal, with planes struggling to shake missiles while avoiding explosions and pulling insane-G maneuvers. It would be safe to say it's a game one will want to come to time and time again.Did I mention the planes can go underwater at any time? And that once there they switch to an underwater configuration? And that there's underwater missions, as well? And that there's sonic booms, working in-cockpit first person view and different atmospheric densities?Now, while still weak at the finer points of the game and control (I feel like the weapon system should be more fleshed out and general presentation is still a bit lacking), if what you want is to fly planes and shoot stuff up, I couldn't recommend a better game to do so with. Easily over War Thunder if you don't mind the limited multiplayer, and easily over Ace Combat Assault Horizon, period.8/10. Not perfect, really *really* friggin' good. For a studio made game. For a one-man project such as this one, it's outstanding.GAMEPLAY VIDEO:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbXAmqgsazA&feature=youtu.be "

												AX:EL is Axe Eel Games, a one person developer, Steam debut and it is one of the strongest sci-fi aerial dogfighting games currently on Steam. The game spent significant time moving through the Steam Early Access program and was released in early December of last year. It has been met with mostly positive community feedback. Fans of the game appreciate the amount of work that it would have taken to make the game solo. Doing so enabled the dev to create and fulfill his ideal vision of the game.One of the best aspects of AX:EL is that you have the ability to build your own aircrafts. While that sounds cool in and of itself it’s not until you’re actually under the hood of the creation system that you truly appreciate its scope. You have the ability to choose an actual ship from twelve different varieties. Then you can choose your wing and tail modules as well as change and adjust weapons systems, counter-measures and the N.A.E.L. (Navigational Automated Evolutionistic Logger). Initially it can all be a little confronting and there’s not a lot of information provided as to what each component does but given a little time you’ll soon work out exactly what each part can do to help your playstyle.When it comes to actual gameplay players can choose from squaring off in the arena or taking on any one of ten mercenary missions. This doesn’t seem like as much as it should be and perhaps you’d be right. I can understand how early access supporters would have been disappointed with the retail version of the game. However, there is a lot of replayability within the confines of the available content. This, aside from the ship building hub is the game’s greatest strength. Even though the mission structures are the same it is rare to find two playthroughs that play out the same. The arena also allows you to match up against bots giving you an opportunity to continue playing even when nobody else is online. Speaking of, unfortunately, I can never find any other games occurring when I look in the lobby.Gameplay is surprisingly fun and somewhat addictive. Some players have reported issues but generally speaking the dev has been very quick to polish areas of weakness in the game. He is continuing to work on the game post-launch and is supporting the game and his developing community. You’re getting exactly what is advertised in the game. That’s a strong dogfighting game set in a sci-fi world  where you can fight in the skies above and deep in the oceans below.A great first up effort with signs of a lot of potential to come.For similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.comTo become fully Steamified join our Steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified "

								About the game:Is an early access, so, right now its like an alpha. Gameplay wise is robust and well made. Graphics are okay-good  (still I readed in some place graphics will be update a little).IA is.. annoying, I mean, really annoying, They really try to kill you at all cost, and in a dogfighting game its cool because you actually can die, its challenging. For now missions are half-made, so I cant really review it (there is some good surprises in missions though)My conclusion: The game concepts and the execution its good, a challenging arcade dogfighting game with customizable aircrafts. Its just that, If you like this kind of game I recomend it 100% because its fun, if not, avoid it.			"

								Update:The Developer responded promptly and resolved the issue with the framerate. The game is promising, and plays somewhat like War Thunder with smoother mouse controls.

			Turns out not every early access game is a waste of space.		

Old review: Well I tried and failed to play the first mission multiple times. Some horrific optimisation issues broke the framerate and it sat like a fat dog stubbornly at 1FPS. I want to love it, but it seems I can't even play it yet. My system specs can run Crysis 14 at 12k. I suggest not buying Early Access games if you want them to work instantly. I even made a video about it because I'm that salty.

Early Access Review
								Incredible work for a game done by one person OoThe flight feeling is really well done, it doesn't feel like a regular plane but more like a real spaceship who can go underwater. Because yes, I totally know how a real spaceship who can go underwater drives. The customisation is great and the graphics are beautiful. They may be less beautiful under the sea, even if a certain singing crab called Sebastian could disagree on that point. The solo mode at the moment is really satisfying, I still didn't tried the online multiplayer but I already have a lot of fun.If you want to craft your own personnal amphibious Starfighter and pilot it in an awesome world, take this game.

								EARLY ACCESS 30/10/2014UPDATE 11/12/14This game was reviewed with a press copy of the game.Ok the game has just updated and now the game is a lot better and is now definately worth picking up if you like dogfighting ship games, although no one still plays the multiplayer you should still pick it up for the singleplayer!==Overview==---CUSTOMISATION------The game's customisation is very simple as you just simply pay (in game currency) for various parts for your ship, for weapons they offer 3 stats 'Radius' 'Direct Force' and energy drain.  Then you can buy wing modules which effect 'Recharge' 'Repair RT' 'Max Speed' and 'Engine PW' this is the same for tail modules. There are also various premade ships which you can also buy that have their own stats.----Flying----The flying is simple, the ship follows your mouse while you speed the ship up, there isn't anything unique or cool to it it's just simple and works fine.I give the game an 8/10 for being a really well made dog fighting ship game, even though no one plays multiplayer the Single player is decent and now with all missions available.YouTube: Coming Soon			"

								Absolutely great game; has a LOT of potential to become even better.Pros:Great combat flight model, theres no flight assist here.Graphics are amazing for a guy doing this on his own, don't get me wrong it's no AAA graphics on a multimillion pound engine but you'll struggle to complain about them.Missions are challenging but there's moments of ""oooooh i get it!"" when you realise what you need to do, and whether you need to turn and fight or just run.Fast paced combat(Jump in an Arena match, 32 bots and a high score threshhold, you'll see what i mean).Potential Potential Potential, the dude developing this game seems very active and i've had a few conversations with him about improvements/bugs, his head's in the game.Cons:The menus are basic, but not hard to navigate, the light blue/cyan can be overpowering; needs a polish?A few bugs/glitches but any i've raised have been fixed.Few things missing that make flight combat easier; enemy direction pointers on the hud, if you get outturned it's difficult to find the enemy again as the combat is very fast pacedYOU HAVE CRASHED, you'll see what i mean :PFor the price of this game it's great, it's one of those games you can dive in for an hour/2 hour and just blitz, save your progress and jump off, rinse, repeat. There's things that could be better, and new things that could be implemented, though as of writing this i've already put a fair few hours into it and i've enjoyed it a massive amount.Get involved, it wont dissapoint you.

												at 1st there were major issues with very erratic gamepad sticks, but was ok with a mouse, however the dev fixed this in 24hrs with a very smooth test patch. Physics - the serene boost/glide flight style with airy sound effects make this feel like a starfighter 3000 [ps1] sequel to me, which is the best flight game i ever played. Gameplay - varied, challenging missions like underwater caves and above ground canyons, with a mix of air/ground targets.GFX - has some pretty basic [even ugly at times] ground texturing, but the water, sky and seaweed is ok. explosions are satisfying.SFX - love the eerie atmospheric sound [with music off] while underwater			"

												Well this is really more someone mucking around with a 3D gaming engine than an actual game.It's a lot better than the tired old 2D retro pixel platformers that people with no talent push out just because they think if they release a game pretending 30 years of advancement in video gaming hasn't taken place, they can quit their job at Starbucks.  This is more of the foundation for a real game that isn't there yet.A lot of effort went into making this game work and it shows.  The visuals in the engine look nice.  There's no sense of ""laziness"" that you get from other games, rather the feeling that it's an incomplete project.Unfortunately as far as games go, it's not a huge amount of fun, you have some ""morphing"" advanced fighter plane that can change shape and turn into a submarine, there's 10 mediocre missions where you shoot uninspired enemies and the game engine gets shown off a lot. It's a good tech demo but not a game you should buy expecting to get Wing Commander or a decent flight sim or anything.			"

												I've been playing this game for a few days at this point, and here's my first impression after finishing the main campaign (with the alt. ending).PROS:-Game adjusts to your movement style-Controls are easy to change-Extreme customizability (main wings, tail wings, guns, body, and skins for each of those)-Decent framerate (with more than 4GB memory)-Aerial AND underwater fightin?! AT THE SAME TIME?!-Decent plot for single player-Option for Single player and multiplayer (although I haven't tried multi yet)-You can replay missions any number of times-The developer is very kind and has quickly replied to (at least my) concerns (bugs and the like), and is generally a very nice person in my experience.-The game is pretty challenging, which is good because that means that it takes that much longer for you to finish teh campaignCONS:-It can take a bit for the game to adjust to your style-If you're dealing with a lot of enemies, your FPS can drop from a relatively smooth 30-45FPS to 7-15FPS-Some of the ships are quite expensive (they're worth it tho)-The main campaign is a little bit on the short sideRATING: a solid 8.5/10. Very good game, with support easily within 24hrs (dev contacted me within like 5 or 6 hrs). Controls are easy to learn, the fighting style is fast-paced and will leave you on the edge of your seat with your butt clenched tighter than it's ever been clenched before (trust me, your mom said so ;) ).

												This game sounds awesome; something like a more customizable Ace Combat. At least, that's what I imagined. Unfortunately, the game doesn't really deliver on that. I really enjoy flight sim games, but this one was pretty frustrating in that regard; there were times when I would spawn into a match dead, because I became targeted before I had the controls, the enemies do high amounts of damage that is largely unavoidable, and the controls are clunky and sluggish. As for the customization, you can only pick from about a dozen aircraft, with different options for tails, wings, and weapons, and that's it. The weapons and customizations are identical for all vehicles (except for the few that can't be customized at all), so they can all only look slightly different, and fly slightly different, and play slightly different. I was so excited by the idea of this game, but it has done nothing but disappoint me.			"

IntroductionPublished by KISS ltd and developed by Ace Eel Games, AX:EL is a flight simulator done right. The gameplay is fun and somewhat addictive, which is a little strange for a game like this. The graphics are well presented and polished up nicely.GameplaySo what are you going to expect from this game that is basically a flight simulator? Well first of all there is a rather nice feature which is implimented into the game that really brings this game up and past the other flight simulators on Steam. This feature, is the ability to be able to create your own aircrafts and be able to fly around in them. For me personally, I am one of those people who will happily take a hour o rtwo to create my aircraft, it does take a little bit to be able to create your aircraft so don't expect to be done in 5 minutes and off you go. It has a rather nice variety of different types of ships that you can choose from, I think there are about twelve different types that you can choose. After you have chosen that, you can then choose your wing and tail parts as well as change your weapons systems and the Navigational Automated Evolutionistic Logger (N.A.E.L). When you first make your craft, it may be a little tedious, as there is rather little amount of information provided as to what each component that you put on your aircraft does. But if you are willing to take a little time and consideration into finding out what each component does then you will figure it out soon enough. When you are finally ready after creating your aircraft, you can then start on the actual gameplay. When you start, you are able to choose fromsquaring off in the arena, or choosing any of the ten missions that they set you on. For a game that is fully released on Steam, to me it didn't really seem like there was much content in the game than there should've been for a fully released game. However, the game does manage to keep pulling you back into some of the missions because of the replay value of this game with the content that is avaialble. Despite the missions are similar structures to one another, it is very doubtful that you will find that two playthroughs of the same mission play out the same way. The arena mode for me wasn't as fun as the missions that you can embark on, you are matched up against bots giving you the ability to continue playinf even if there is nobody else online in your lobby. However, it was rather unfortunate that I couldn't find any other games that where going on in the lobby as I looked through. Overall, the gameplay is rather fun and addicting to play.The graphics of this game are really well done, there seems to have been a lot of time and effort that has gone into every little detail of this game as you play it through. The atmosphere really works well, with this type of sci-fi feeling with the sky really works well when you are flying and shooting in combat. Each ship variety is done really well, they aren't just copied and reskinned like some other game. They have all of their own unique features of them making each of them look really polished and nicely presented.Pros+ Ability to be able to create your own aircraft+ Nice variety of componenets to create your aircraft+ Lots of replay value+ Fun and addictive gameplay+ No two playthroughs of the same missions are the same+ Nicely polished and presented graphics.+ Trading Cards & AchievementsCons- Creating your aircraft takes a fair amount of time,- Not much infomation about what each component does when you build your aircraft- Not as much content as I would of hoped forResult / Final thoughtsWith this dogfighting simulator that has a lot of vairety and replay value to the game, I really recommened this game to anyone who likes this genre of gaming. With the ability to be able to fly in the skies and then dive into the ocean is a satifying feeling that you won't instantly crash when you hit the water. All of the graphics are nicely presented and the gameplay is fun and addicting. Just a few things that need to be polished up here and there, which aren't major things at all.Rating: 8.5/10For more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow ReviewExperts curator group here.

												It looks alright. Cool that you can go underwater...I think that's all the positive I can say about it....which (being underwater) might be the best part of the game.I went in with good expectations. Those even raised in the controls menu, where you could say it is suggested you should hook up a joystick if you have one.After I was set, I went for some quick action against bots...and my expectations instantly crashed into oblivion.Gameplay is anything but enjoyable. Options what you can do are second to none. Sure you can pimp your craft and there are several to choose from (no, I did not try either), but I really can't see how this game could be enjoyed.There are different daytime conditions and weather/visibility conditions, but not something that can improve the rest of the game.So, quick action, you can set amount of bots and some conditions, then it is standard dog fight...well, not really. AI is OK, it can surely shoot you down. There are 10 difficulty options for it. But once they got near, it just became a beehive...a swarm. Several aircrafts spinning and turning in an area around 300 cubic feet :D :(Campaign...some forgettable debrief, boggies fly in, you shoot them down, more come, you win again, land. Writing this line gave me more fun and adrenaline.I have played many 3D flying games (arcade, sim and all in between) and I don't recall one so depressing. Excuse that this is one man team...come on. 1 or 1000 can make a good game or a bad game. Saying something is good because it's a small team invites just more projects to fill Steam store with time and money wasting products...and we have several 1000 like that in the store already.Instead of this I can easily recommend 2 20 year old games from DOS times. F29 Retaliator and F-15 Strike Eagle 2. Graphically they are no match to this, audio is about on par, but these 2 are masterpieces in comparison in gameplay/fun/tactics/options/... departments. I don't know what to recommend on Steam that is similar, since everyhting else I have is Steamless, but surely there are other games on Steam to feed your need for dog fights.My first use of: Remove this licence from my Steam accountIt felt good :)			"

YouTube™ Video: AX:EL - Air XenoDawn Honest Review 

			Views: 1,234		

			Air XenoDawn mite not be the Game for me but it doesn't stop me from Enjoying it and talk about how good it actually is for a Game made by one Man looking to create a Game like nothing else out...		

I'l be Honest Air XenoDawn is not my sort of Game Butby no means does it mean i have not Enjoyed my time with the Game.As i spend more time with it, the more I realize its actuallyReally freaking Good especially when you consider its madeBY ONE MANYes a single person has manged to make a Game completelyUnqiue with almost nothing else like it that i can find.Now i lack the Wrighting skills and i don't think i couldDo the Game Justice so i'l leave that to my Video Review butConsider this when thinking of Buying the Game.Don't Judge it by Looks or the TrailerHave a look at it and pay attention to the Gameplay.Look at the style and for the feel of how it plays.If you like Hardcore Aircraft based Dogfighting gamesThen grab a copy and have a go at it and what could you lose?.Steam has its refund systemAnd Yes it sounds harsh but the only way i feel you can truly Understand and appreciate the Game and the Experiance is toPlay it yourself and experience it.I really do Hope we see a succesor to it once work has stopped on itAnd using something like the Unreal Engine.I would love to seeHigher Quality Visual Assets and this Gameplay to make a Gamethat not just Re Invents but bring back the Hardcore Aircraft BasedDog Fighting Genre that was way more popular it seems years ago.I most likely won't do it justice with words alone but hopefullyThis combined with my Video Review is enough to get my point accross That it is well worth Trying before you Judge it.Update 2/05/2016Games still getting Updates and has improved a lot more.Props to Alex for taking Critique and Feedback and using it toImprove the game for the Better :)			"

												Strange game. Visuals are a mixed bag.. the 3d environment looks quite good whilst everything else is a steep curve in the opposite direction. The sound design is good for the most part. I gave up trying to use a controller as it felt horrible no matter how I configured it.. which is a shame (can't roll & pitch at the same time.. dafuq?). Lots of long pauses and stuttering with the framerate throughout the game. Upgrading ships and weapons is kind of pointless since you can finish the entire game in the default loadout with relative ease, which I'll admit was a race to the finish.			"

								Like pretty mutch the rest of the reviews. the concept is a really good idea and should be worked on! But for now my main complaint is the run speed! i have a decent computer and im forced to use the lowest graphics and i still only get around 18 FPS! But like i said, this game has a really cool thing going!			"

												This game may appear dead from the discussions page since there is not much going on there, but the Dev is still active and working on the game. Although the controls can feel a bit wonky and the objective can be unclear sometimes, you eventually figure it out.By all means, this is not a great game, but it is also not a bad game. Give it a chance and you'll probably enjoy it. I am, even though its not my type of game. I'd rate it a 6/10, low 7/10 in the current state.			"

												I'm clicking thumbs up just because I got it for free and I know there is this one guy who develped this game so I won't blame him.My reviewI had a headache because of the controls just for playing 25min.The sounds are very old.The effects are not that impressive and the graphics are a little dark.I got bored from the first 5 min that I played.The multiplayer is dead, you can host your own match using port forwarding or somthing like that.The game is not worth 11$ or even 5$.The game looks like in the very early development and not yet ready.

			Greetings fellow gamers! This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Indie Action Flight Simulator AX:EL - Air XenoDawn.		

The ""Too Long, Didn't Watch"" Review:Fun flight sim. Great Action. Awesome for One-Man Crew! 4/5The ""Meat & Potatoes"" Review:Another hidden gem has been found on Steam! Are you a fan of Flight Sims, Dogfights, Airplane Combat, etc? This may be your ticket to fun here. This is not going to be the most detailed as far as simulation goes, it's not Flight Simulator X or anything, but it is an awesome flying combat simulator. Especially for the price! This one-man project is absolutely a thrill. There is a solid Solo campaign, complete with a good story and a pretty cool Report you are given for each mission. Very nice touch. Speaking of nice touches, the interesting thing this game has that no other game like it does? Your plane is fully capable of going underwater as well, continuing the combat below the surface. A really neat mechanic that adds to the fun and chaos of some of the battles. There is also an awesome arena for Multiplayer combat. TONS of fun can be had here and also, you can play the Arena with Bots if you would like to simply practice or mess around in that way. You really have a lot of options for customization too as you progress and earn money. All in all, this is a great little find for under $15. It made it through Steam's Early Access and the developer is still quite active and friendly. If you want to enjoy some flying combat, without having to plop down big bucks, this is the title for you. Great effort from just one guy, 4/5 and worth every penny of the $13.Happy Gaming!			"

												Disclaimer: The review key for this product was provided by the developer free of charge. Check out this review and others at Nouse Gaming: http://www.nouse.co.uk/muse/gaming/------------------------------------------------I'll admit I went into AX:EL with some fairly high hopes. Having recently got into War Thunder with some friends I was looking for some fun dogfighting action and the 'undersea' mechanic had me interested.The first impression of any game (whether you realise it or not) is from the main menu screen and other elements of the GUI (Graphic User Interface) This is where AX:EL hits probably its biggest problem. The interface is at best poorly designed and in truth feels like an afterthought. Whilst a simple utilitarian GUI is never great it's better than having an overly stylistic and confusing one like AX:EL. Navigating the menus is a task in itself and especially in the hub where the cut off words on buttons and lack of tool tips means that I've very little idea of what's going on. The poor GUI really shows through in the 'Hub'. The Hub is where you buy upgrades and paint jobs for your ships. The problem is it's very difficult to tell exactly what you're buying and what it does. There seems to be a fair amount of customisation to your ship. I say seems to be because despite the large number of buttons and sliders it didn't seem to actually do anything.The game also looks pretty poor. The texture quality is downright abysmal and even the plane models look like they're from the early PS2 era. Whenever you get close enough to anything be it enemies, the ground or the aircraft carrier you immediately notice how bad it looks wrenching you out of any immersion you may have had. And for the most part there's not much to look at, most of the fights take place over or under an empty ocean.Graphics however aren't everything. It's been proven again and again that even with bad graphics and GUI a game can still be great, just look at 'Consuming Shadows' for a recent example. AX:EL's game play however is about as good as it's graphics. Upon starting it up and finding the controls strange I decided to rebind them which lead to, interesting consequences (LINK:

(The Developer has since responded to this and fixed it)Having reset to default and after a bit of playing around I somewhat got a hang on the controls and then set about on the missions which are the standard fare. Go here. Shoot down these things. Find the plot point etc. With a completely forgettable story the game boils down to navigate the space and dog fight with anything that comes your way. The problem for this is that you feel like a tank with wings. The plane is so totally unresponsive to your input so the fighting is a long chase until you eventually manage to luck out and blow them up. And how about the underwater mechanic? Well it's exactly the same as in the air. As in I didn't notice a single difference besides the blue tint to the screen and the obnoxious bubbles that come off the back of your plane. No slow down, no different controls or feel to the flight. This meant that the underwater component feels very much like a gimmick, not even one that much effort was put into.AX:EL is a title that I can't recommend at all. All it offers is some poor quality dog fighting and there are far better options out there. I mean with War Thunder being free to play there's nothing that AX:EL offers over it.			"

Early Access Review
								Keep in mind this is kind of an early access overview.When you first start the game there is some minor opening dialogue to try to create a sort of back story.  The premise behind the story may seem fine as a concept; however, the dialogue and grammar leave a lot to be desired.  The interface is very basic right now and a lot of the elements are not very user friendly.  I experienced some flickering on the craft mesh when in the 'Hub' menu going through aircraft options.  There are a lot of graphical options that can be tweaked under options, but once I launched the first mission with all of the settings on high the quality wasn't what I expected.  I understand that this game is still at a very early stage of its development, but in given game's current state I cannot recommend it.			"
