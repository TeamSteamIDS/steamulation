For those interested in this game, here are some details that are useful to know.You are a bipedal tank:--- Your torso moves separate from legs, and some Mechs have Jump Jets, which allow short flight depending on the number of JJ's equipped.This is a team game:--- Stay with the pack, especially when you first start. Don't be the only Mech the enemy sees.One Life to Live:In standard ""Quick Play"" game you drop in one Mech, after you die, you will have to wait until that game is finished before you can play that Mech again. In Faction Play (Clan Warfare) you get to drop with 4 Mechs.This is a ""slow"" paced shooter:--- Movement and turn speeds are based on the Mech you are in, not the speed you set your mouse to. Variation:---The speed difference alone between the fastest and slowest Mech is over 100kph, leading to huge variations in play style. Aside from this, Lasers, Ballistics/PPCs, Long Range Missiles (LRMs), and Short Range Missiles (SRMs) all have different methods to success.Location based damage:---  If you ""spray and pray"", you will get damage in, but fail to kill your opponent. Targeting vital spots is key to putting the enemy down. Let your lasers burn the whole duration into your opponent to get full damage. The opposite is true if you are getting shot, make sure to turn your torso to spread damage.Heat management is very important:--- Almost all weapons create heat on use, and if not managed will put you into a shutdown state, or if you override the shutdown, do extreme internal damage.Customization: --- Setting your Mech up with weapons and armor of your choosing is the one of the best parts of the game, but you don't get to do that until you buy your own Mech. This does not mean you have to spend real money however, as they give you large bonuses for the first 20 or so matches. Do make your first choice wisely, the forums are a good place to get suggestions.Cost:--- You can get a lot out of this game for free. The way you earn money (C-bills) to buy Mechs is by playing more matches, so I can't really consider it a grind. You do need to have Mech Bays in order to buy Mechs however, and these cost MC, which is real money currency.  If you are patient PGI does give away MC and Mech Bays during special events for participation, and task competition. Some Mechs, called Hero Mechs can only be purchased with MC, the only thing that makes them worthwhile is a bonus to C-bill earning, otherwise they are mostly just novelty paint, on a somewhat unique loadout, however never really better than what you can buy normally. If you do want to spend money, I suggest buying MC in a quantity that gets a good discount and buying Mech Bays when they go on sale. Competitive: --- The Match Maker works fairly well, though it is population dependent. If you are new, you will start at the bottom ""Tier"" which is 5. As you move up, not only does individual skill ramp up, but so does group cooperation.NGNG has a good youtube channel if you want to see some gameplay.			"

												Soon I'm sure you'll see a flood of reviews, highlighting the best and worst MechWarrior and Pirrana Games has to offer. On one hand, you'll have people who have played this game for three years and have never had a problem with it. On the other, you'll have people who have felt burned, rightfully so, and still have residual resentment for it. I want to be a slightly more moderate voice, and try my best to review the game as I see it.I want to start, by saying I find the game fun, and I've been playing it on and off for three years. It's a very niche game, even if it didn't have giant stompy robots which is a niche genre all itself, it's ""a thinking man's shooter"" which takes a more slow, methodical approach to First Person Shooters. Because of this, it offers a very unique experience which, if you like that sort of thing like I do, it's very hard to find another game that quite scratches the same itch. The game is Free to Play in the same sort of way that Ketchup is a vegetable, it's technically accurate for some value of the term. For the most part, at it's best, the game is Pay2NotGrind and Pay4Vanity. At it's worst, however, you have things like the Stalker Hero ""Misery,"" a $30 dollar reasonably solid 'meta' mech that is only available with cash money.Which is actually the real bulk of the problem, the pricing for the game is very, very high for very little. You can take a look for yourself at the ""DLC"" on this page - each of those Performance Packs are for two mechs, which - minus a boost to the earnable in-game currency - are identical to their earnable with in-game currency counterparts. I'm sure you'll hear about the $500 gold mech packages they offered a year ago, ( technically, still are offering from a year ago ) but that really is a extreme, argueably not entirely PGIs fault since they were still under IGP at the time, and I'd like to believe everyone involved has learned their lession and will never do anything like it again ( although, like I said, the offer is still available. )  The more consistant reality of it is somewhere around $20-30 for a mech, which is still fairly high.The good news is, for the most part, nearly all mechs become available with the earnable in-game currency some months after they're released to people who first ""pre-ordered"" the mechs in early access packs, and after they're released to people for cash money. ( Pay2NotWait? ) Usually this isn't a problem although sometimes the mechs are slightly to very OP and unbalance things, making the game unfun for anyone who didn't pre-order. The only real exception to this are ""Hero"" mechs which normally are slightly underpowered but gimmicky varriants of a mech, sometimes with ties into lore, but generally aren't the best version of any mech. Usually. There are exceptions. A lot of the residual resentment I mentioned earlier stems from the previous tendency to remain close-lipped about the direction the game was going, to ignore any real community feedback, and a very slow development cycle. Most of these have been improved upon since PGI got out from under IGPs thumb - Development has severely picked up pace and new things besides mech packs have been added to the game fairly frequently. PGI is much more open about what they're doing / what direction they want to move the game into. Feedback from what I've seen is still somewhat spotty, although from my understanding they decided to not go through with ""ghost damage,"" a mechanic that was nearly universally hated - where in the past they would have just gone through and added it anyway ( looking at you 3rd Person and Ghost Heat ) - so, I suppose that too is improving. Overall, since I need to select Yes or No to ""Do you recommend this game?"" I have to say no.I like the game, I find it fun, but that doens't make it a good game by default. Between shaking off the ghost of IGP past, elements from three years ago which still feel unfinished ( mostly looking at Community Warfare here, which while ""still in beta"" has been worked on since launch ) and a high cost of premium elements ... It's just not a good game for the everyman. Added onto the fact that even if this game was perfect, it would still be kind of a niche game - and some people would just not be able to get into it - it makes those flaws even more hard to overlook when considering a binary ""Yes or No"" answer.I would, however, suggest that if you think you might be able to get into it - to at least give it a try and find out. Don't spend any money on it until you're sure you like it, but if you do - like I said, it's a fairly unique experience and hard to find games quite like it.Small, Edit : Everything up until this point is aimed for potential new players, not members of the prexisting userbase. I don't need to explain what's good or bad with the game to you, you already know and have your own opinions, and that's fine, you're more then welcome to make your own review or tell me what you agree or disagree about mine - conversation is good.But, this, and only this is specifically for the prexisting userbase - I understand you like this game, I understand being critical of things you enjoy can be hard, but be a little respectful, would you? If you're so concerned about one negative review turning people away then how do you think they're going to react when they read the comment section?			"

												Always press RTurn off arm lock and throttle decay when you learn how to walk. Press X to stop.Use arrows and right control to assign weapon groups.«CLAN» doesn't mean «unit of players» in this game, it's lore stuff, google for «Battletech clans» (you will also find out why 90% of players have Kerensky in their nicknames). Ammo can explode. Except Gauss ammo. Other equipment doesn't explode. Except Gauss rifle.You can switch ECM modes with J button.Pegular PPC doesn't deal any damage in range below 90 meters.You will get banned for mentioning Hitler. 40 years old men playing this game don't get jokes.Hold alt while entering 3rd peson mode to keep minimap active.And don't forget to add smurfy mechlab and Sarna to your bookmarks.Now you can robot.

												New to the gameI definitly recommend this game. This game is so much fun that i have to do my first review on it! :)Pros(good):-Gameplay experience is outstanding. It's probs because I'm playing on a high end computer so if you have one of these, the game will run flawless for you.-Graphics is up to a really good standard, it you want to be picky, the only thing it's laking in is that your surroundings isnt really real enough-not including the fact that you nock trees down when walking through them because thats including real features-able to customize the weapons,skins,engine,armour and skills of your mechs, skills is more for your piloting of the mech-when you start, you get a lot of bills (which is the mechwarrior earnable currency) which quckly gets you what ever mech you want early, just make sure you save up-There are trial mechs for you that rotate all the time so you can try out different mech stylesThere arn't any major cons but there are some minior ones(not so good)-it's sort of a unnecessarily hard grind but it's kinda not there when your have so much fun on the game-no close combat action because mech warrior is more a fps with mechs-It's a little pay to win but this is not a big factor due to the fact that they have trial mechs that you can use until the rotation of the trial mech change. this trial mechs can have some of the strongest battle configurations.If you played League of Legends, the trial system is basicly the same as thatPlease give me a thumbs up if this review is helpful in anyway, please do because this is my first review			"

												Edit:There seem to be a lot of people who are eager to downvote reviews for no reason.I'm up for criticism, so if you find my review to be not helpful, let me know why.The Thing:Since it's release I've been coming back to this game and it will very likely remain one of my all time favoritesDon't let my relatively low play time on Steam fool you. I've been playing this game for a long time before it was on Steam. [hipster]And obviously before it was cool.[/hipster]The thing I probably like most about it is it's complexity. It is indeed a rather complex game and it requires time to learn and overcome. If you prefer a more casual approach to a game similar (similar, not the same!) to this, I'd recommend Robocraft.(EDIT: I do not recommend Robocraft anymore!)But this here is Robocraft for grown-ups, for people with fully developed breasts and beards.I'm serious. You will have to invest time into this game for it to be good. And, if you do, it's going to be really good, that much I can tell you.What to expect: Very tactical and very team-oriented games of 12 versus 12 giant robots from the future, armed to the teeth. Mostly extremely customizable mech-loadouts (depending on faction).Any mech plays differently, some of them fundamentally differently. Even a single mech can play very differently, if you just change the weapons.Do you like to let rockets rain down on your enemies from 1000 meters away? Or do you want to do sustained damage with lasers over medium distances? Maybe you like to just go in and brawl face to face with short range missiles. Maybe you feel like a supporter and want to help your mates by providing visuals on enemies for your team to lock on. The four weight classes (light, medium, heavy, assault) are very distinct from one another.Lights, for instance, are able to easily outmaneuver the rather cumbersome assault mechs. But lights also have very little armor and, of course, not as much firepower as the bigger ones.Medium mechs feel like a good allround-weight class, probably best to start with.Heavies to me are, well, heavier mediums. That's not meant to sound derogatory. After all, heavies are heavier than mediums, because they have more room for armor and weapons. They're probably as good of a weight class to start out with as mediums. Within the game itself there's both a casual approach, as well as a more competetive player base.You can drop (your mech gets deployed by a dropship) in games alone with other loners, who might play well as a team or mess up completely, because they're bad at communicating. These drops are referred to as PUG-drops (Pick Up Group). Or you can form a group of up to 12 players and drop with them.There's faction play, where units (basically the name for the guys with tags in front of their names, in other games usually called 'clans') come together to fight for star systems. They can control star systems and have to defend them against other units, or they will lose control over them.There's also a lot of people role playing, who enjoy lore-based... stuff. I mean, lore-based things, you get the idea. Duels between two mechs for instance, with important things like, I don't know, honor and♥♥♥♥♥♥ Read the books. The devs are cool and nice and react and interact and everything. They stream on Twitch on a regular basis where you can watch them work on new content and watch them just generally be in touch with their player base. The devs also reward players for playing. There's been customer appreciation reward programs. Within these you'd receive rewards varying from C-Bill-rewards (C-Bills are the ingame currency you earn by playing) just for playing the game. Plus, if you've decided to put money into the game and buy MC (the ingame currency bought for $$$) or one of their mech packs, you usually get a whole bunch of other things (including MECHS!) for free. This game has one of the most mature player bases I know. People usually are more respectful and more helpful. After all, there's a high likelihood of them having fully developed breasts and beards.You can easily drop into a game at any time, ask for new friends and what you get is people who want to marry you. There's also a looking for group function in the main menu. This way you can easily group up with strangers from all over the world. It's like OKcupid, but with giant stomping robots, war and explosions. What more could you wish for?There are a few things that shouldn't go unmentioned, though: In the beginning, meaning for your first 25 matches, you will receive very high C-Bill rewards. Same goes for completing the tutorial, which you should play in any case. You'll have a few million C-Bills after completing those first matches and the tutorial. After this, however, progress will be much slower.You have to be aware that sometimes earning C-Bills feels like grinding. Other times it's a lot of fun, because it just happens while playing. After all, there's a certain satisfaction to melting through your enemies' armor and soldering off their arms to cripple their firepower. I mean it. This is something I haven't experienced in any other game so far. It is after your 25 first matches and after the completion of the tutorial when you should start looking for which mech you want to buy first. For this you'll have to read into the meta a little, at least that's what I'd recommend. There are some helpful videos on the Tubes of You, too.Search for mechs that are good, avoid mechs that really are bad (not many, but they do exist at the moment).And if at first you don't like the mech you purchased, don't worry. It might just take some time to get used to it and figure out the way it's played best. This really does take some time with any mech, especially if you're just starting out. So take your time, don't get frustrated too easily.If after a while you still don't like your first mech, try different builds on it. If you still don't like it, try a mech of another weight class. You will have to use trial mechs for your first games. These mechs are being interchanged every now and then, so people can try out different ones.There are 4 mechs free to use in every weight class. 2 of each belong to one of the two factions: The Inner Sphere or the invading Clans. The game is not pay to win.Yes, certain mechs are only available for MC. But they are not superior. Some (few!) of them happen to be within higher tiers of the current meta, but they are surrounded and outnumbered by mechs for C-Bills. Others are only available for real $$$ over a period of time, before getting released for the purchase with C-Bills.Some of the things you can buy for MC include premium time and cosmetic items, such as paint jobs for your mech or cockpit items.By the way, there are lots of events that let you earn cosmetic items, mech bays or even mechs, simply by participating. You will need free mech bays in order to park new mechs.In the beginning you have a few free mech bays. Once they are full, you obviously need new ones. Mech bays can only be bought for MC OR have to be earned by participating in events. If you really, really don't want to invest any money whatsoever in this game, you can do so. But then you should make sure to participate in most of the events. Otherwise you won't have enough free bays to park your mechs at some point.tl;drWow. This was a long review.Unfortunately there is no way for me make this short. It is a complex game that deserves a long review. I recommend you read the whole thing.Ultimately I recommend you play the game. "

												New player here. I really enjoy this game and don't really see whats up with the stream of bad reviews rolling in. Use your head, play it safe and you'll make it, most of the time. This is not so much a game you can jump into and be good at. It seems like these days that's all people want out of a game, an easy, instant gratification game. You have to put some work into your play's in order to win here.Its free, give it a shot.			"

												Being a mechwarrior since 1995 and MWO player since beta, with over 500hrs actual playtime on the battlefields plus around 400hrs more in the mechlab and over 500€ spent in mech packs and MC, I guess I can proudly call myself a mechwarrior veteran.Even this game has nothing much left to do with the former serie except the lore itself and its technichal gameset, I can still say that MWO is the best free-to-play game on the market, next to Planetside 2 and War Thunder.Overall it wins mostly because of its community. Really, the community is massive. You dont get that often in the F2P era...Pros:+ hundreds of different mechs+ all highly customizable+ complex loadout editor/mechlab+ multiple classes/roles to play+ events with free stuff every week+ big legit, active and nice community+ both competitive and lore friendly+ leagues+ a lot of different factions to fight for+ 4 gamemmodes+ decent amount of maps+ runs smooth and stable+ thousands of units to play with+ voice chat+ frequent updates (yes they work on it 24/7!)+ tiersCons:- tiers- time and money consuming (as all F2P titles)- steep learning curve- unforgiving gameplay- ""sometimes"" frustrating- minor bugs- no AI (yet!)- still no coop (but announced for 2016)- some mechs can only bought with real money (they are not better or something - NO PAY TO WIN HERE!)- too few maps imo- THE META!Pro Tips:- look at the map constantly- find allies, stick together- make friends, join a unit- don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥ no place for Rambos- read about the lore, know the enemy- get used to die asap- get better and stronger, gg(Please dont expect a new mechwarrior game...this one is a competitive version of it!

Let me preface this by saying I am still playing MWO, off and on, and will continue playing it because it does enough things right to be a worthwhile game.  If you don't care about the background skip to the pros and cons!Keep in mind when reading MWO Steam reviews that there is a huge community schism regarding MWO.  Many old players (sometimes called 'Islanders') are justifyably frustrated by PGI's handling of the game.  Others (the 'white-knights') believe that the game is finally in a good place and is getting better, and that PGI is therefore forgiven for past transgressions.  Most probably fall somewhere in-between.  I would like to imagine I fall somewhere into the third camp.Now for the bad news.  As many things as MechWarrior Online does right, there are still so many things wrong with it I cannot in good conscience recommend it to new players.  I will skip the diatribe about PGI's terrible history with community relations (I was a Legendary Founder which means I paid way too much money during alpha for a product that fell short of almost all of its design goals) and focus on the pros and cons of the game as it stands now.  Other reviews adequately cover the game's rocky history.What I like-Very graphically appealing-Sound is immersive-Combat feels visceral and intense.  Inflicting and recieving damage involves a lot of sparks, explosions and camera shake-Battlemechs have never felt stompier!-Matches are generally fast and tight-Weapons feel thematic (Lasers travel instantaneously and 'burn' for an extended duration, missiles are fired in swarms, ballistics throw sparks on impact and cause the victim's cockpit to jerk)-Is fairly simple to learn and play without lacking strategic depth -Teamwork is paramount and rewarded through play-The community can be great-A number of people have correctly pointed out that new players get a number of c-bill injections to help them outfit their first mech or two.  It's a nice touch, as long as new players are careful about what they spend this cash onWhat I don't-The grind is obscene.  There are people who will tell you otherwise.  They play a lot more than you and have the skills, equipment and chassis to rack up those c-bills.  As a new player, you won't have this luxury, so expect an uphill battle to afford even one properly equipped chassis with double heat sinks, endo-steel structure, an engine that doesn't suck and a loadout that won't overheat after one alpha this isn't entirely true anymore, new players will likely be able to afford their first chassis relatively quickly but will suffer from a rapid dropoff of income once their rookie bonus runs out-Related to the above, PGI prices content like mechs higher than any other F2P game I've ever played.  Hearthstone and League of Legends both require far less time and money to 'max out' an account on, and many complain about the grind in those games-The metagame is somewhat rigid and PGI hasn't done a great job of balancing it-There is a serious lack of variety in terms of maps and modes - while it is not as bad as it used to be pretty much there are only two things to do, competitive community warfare matches (meh) and random queue brawls (this is almost all of what you'll be doing)-Grind-New players aren't given any freebies, they have to play with garbage trial mechs that use stock configurations from the tabletop game until they can afford to invest in one of their own It has been brought to my attention this is no longer the case.  The trial mechs are far better designed than they used to be, I might even pilot a few tonight!-While the bonus cash for new accounts is nice, the falloff afterwards can be pretty staggering.  Especially since you still need to skill 3 variants of a mech in order to unlock the elite skills-Lack of variety is crippling to any long term enjoyment from this game.  You will VERY quickly memorize the map pool and even if you are one of those crazies who enjoys community warfare you'll find the only novelty in the game comes from the new overpriced chassis they churn out.-Few game modes-The community can suck-Did I mention the grind?ConclusionI usually don't review games on steam, but I felt compelled to in this case.  MWO is very close to being the great game it always had the potential to be, but PGI needs to seriously reconsider their pricing model as well as the pacing of in-game rewards if they don't want to drive away most of their new Steam players.As a prospective player, my recommendation would be that you play the game and find out for yourself.  It costs you nothing but the time it takes to download and play it, so unless you're an impulsive spender it can't really hurt to see if it appeals to you.  There isn't really anything else like it on the market.Edit: for those who don't understand why I gave this game a negative review despite its merits, there is no option between 'recommend' or 'not recommend'.  For the time being my opinion leans towards the latter.Edit 2:  I pretty much ditched this game entirely shortly after writing this review.  At least at the time PGI's energies were almost entirely spent on dishing out new chassis they could sell and the myriad problems with the game appeared to have mostly fallen by the wayside.  As such take anything I've written here with a grain of salt as it may be out of date.  Probably not though, knowing PGI.			"

												I have played a lot of Mechwarrior Online. To qualify that: I was one of the first 500 invited into the closed beta in 2012. I have also played community warfare (CW) with some of the best players in the game since that game mode was added over a year ago. In 2011 I bought a 60 (Canadian) dollar founders pack for this game, because I feel that is a sane and reasonable limit to spend for a quality videogame product. And, despite the thumbs down on this review, at the time I was completely happy with my purchase. That 60 dollar founders pack came with an exclusive mech, 30 days of premium time, and 20 000 MC (the paid for currency of this game).Today to buy the same collection of things in mechwarrior will cost you over 100 American dollars, and brings up the real issue I have with this game: The fun you will have is a byproduct of a gaming experience that has been designed from the ground up to take from you.If you decide to play this game, you will face an extremely punishing grind. ""Mastering"" a mech involves grinding out three tiers of skills with xp, which unlocks various bonuses that are straight upgrades. If you want that 7.5% faster run speed (huge) you will need to basic out all the elite skills on 3 mechs of the same chassis, essentially slightly different versions of the same mech. This is assuming that you have ground out enough cash to purchase the 3 mechs, and outfit them with good weapons, and upgrade them properly. It goes without saying that all of this takes a significant amount of time.The classic rebuttal to this is the argument that this is a free to play game, and people are free to pay to bypass the grind. That fails to denude the fact that this game will either take a lot of your time, or a lot of your money, or sometimes both (you can't buy those mastery skills but you can buy premium to help you grind faster). The carrot of mech stomping laser blasting fun lies at the top of a steep greasy hill, and the people on that hill will be firing at you the whole time you're climbing up.This is the price you are expected to pay as a new player, and it is why I cannot recommend this game to any of my friends or you.""review the game play"" - Man in comments sectionThe basic controls and movement in MWO are actually pretty solid, it's probably the thing this game does the best. You feel like a big heavy mech, your arm weapons can track different target than your torso weapons, you get stuck on tiny rocks a LOT. That last item was sarcasm. You will constantly be clipping up against small pieces of terrain that don't really serve a purpose and can't be destroyed or crushed like a proper mech should be able to do. Also, as a related issue, there are problems with the hitboxes on a lot of terrain. You will often see your lasers and autocanons impact a rock that is visually several feet to the side. Also, there are no targets in this game other than enemy mechs. There are no tanks, vehicles, helicopters, or infantry to give you a sense of scale to undercut how much psychotic power you should be feeling while driving a multi story killing machine. The hitboxes on mechs also suffer a lot of problems related to their geometry. You can take damage on your back armour when being shot from the front sometimes for no reason.The weapon balance in this game is atrocious, but I'm not going to be able to talk about balance in this game without incurring a LOT of vitriol from old timey mechwarrior fans who's deluded iron grip on a tabletop game that ceased to be relevant 20 years ago turns every rational discussion about balance in this game into a horde of mewling cries of ""th th thats not like the tabletop!"" So I expect to have a lot of fun with the comments section after this edit. The battletech tabletop game doesn't let players control which part of the enemy mech they shoot, it's decided with 2d6 instead. In the land of first person shooters, you get to decide how you want to click on the screen, which is something a lot of the diehard tabletop crew isn't very good at and doesn't understand. In MWO, the best builds are the ones that do a ton of alpha damage to a concentrated specific part of the enemy mech, usually center torso or legs. That is just objectively the fastest way to kill someone. The best weapons for this are lasers, because they are hitscan, have decent range, and also weigh much less than their counterparts, ballistic and missile weapons. For the most part, there is no reason to use anything else. On the other end of the spectrum, you have long range missiles (LRMs) which are laughably useless. They require a target lock, and then you need to wait for a long arcing travel time while maintaining that lock for the missiles to connect. They hit in a spread pattern which doesn't synergize with the whole ""kill them quickly"" plan. They also have a minimum range, where the missiles just impact and do nothing. Also, the expensive and costly ""target deprivation"" pilot module breaks target lock as soon as you break line of sight. Experienced players who know how to position themselves almost never get hit.Clan vs Inner Sphere is also a big problem. In Battletech lore, the clans are a seperate faction of militant space facists who show up halfway into the timeline so FASA could make some more money. Clan mechs run faster, carry more weapons for less weight, have improved cooling, carry more armour, and take more internal damage before being destroyed. They also have the only mechs in the game with MASC at the moment, which is basically a sprint button. The developers initially added clans into the game with the same values they had on the tabletop without really any balance considerations. Whoever had spent real money on a clan mech was god for several months. The developers tried to bring Inner Sphere mechs up to par by giving them ""quirks"" internal perks that are bound to specific chassis that do things like increase heat dissipation or decrease cooldown on specific types of weapons. This system works but only for a small handful inner sphere mechs out of hundreds of possible choices, the rest of them have mostly useless quirks, like increased range on anti missile systems (nobody uses these).The reality of this is mostly ignored by a huge section of the community. You will rarely see good builds, even at the highest matchmaking tier. You will also run into a lot of people who call themselves ""support players"" which is just another way of saying that they will be the last on your team to die hiding behind a hill because they only brought LRMs. If you ask for advice, most of the time that advice will be wrong. I can honestly say that this is one of the most fanatically ignorant gaming communities that I have ever born witness to.If you plan to play with anything less than 11 other friends this game is miserable to play from a team co-ordination perspective. Most solo queue matches involve teams milling around aimlessly until one of them is dead. If you queue up with a buddy, you will end up in the group queue with a bunch of other small un-cordinated teams usually sided against a full 12 man most of the time. If you queue up for CW by yourself things only get worse, because those games take longer, usually end up more lopsided, and have no actual matchmaking to determine who plays who.This game is basically the video game interpretation of the malebolge from Dante's Inferno.

												How can I sum up something so great as Mechwarrior Online into a short, readable review that won't sink too deep in analysing the techical aspects of the game?Let's start by explaning what this game is all about...Mechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe (1984), where different clans fight from planets and resources. You play 12 vs. 12 matches in various game modes and maps. Fighting, winning, and getting more money according to your combat performance has a great role in the game, but tinkering and customizing your 'Mechs is also a HUGE part of MWO (Mechwarrior Online).'MechsSo what are Mechwarriors then? Mechwarriors are the brave pilots of these huge lumbering mechanical tanks that have evolved from the basic battletank design into more efficient walking weapon platforms, 'Mechs.'Mechs are divided into different categories according to their chassis weight: Light Mechs (35 tons), Medium Mechs (55 tons), Heavy Mechs (75 tons) and Assault Mechs (100 tons).Lights are commonly used as scouts and intel 'Mechs, but they're also very efficient at taking down bigger assault mechs due to their great mobility. A pack of fast moving Light Mechs can easily swarm a bigger, slower 'Mech punching holes into the armors, tearing down weapons and limbs, eventually destroying it. And that can happen very fast if you're stranded too far from your team members.Medium and Heavy Mechs are bit bigger, slower, carry more armaments and armor and can take up more beating than Light Mechs.Assault Mechs are the biggest, slowest heavy hitters that you can see on the battlefield. A good Assault pilot will wreck everything coming it's way - but do not think that more weapons always means more success in combat. There are so many factors that you have to think during combat.

'Mech LoadoutsEvery new 'Mech you buy comes with a stock loadout. Every 'Mech has 3-7 variants, which means the chassis of the 'Mech is pretty much the same, but the weapon hardpoints are different. One chassis might be more suitable for missile focused loadouts and other might have only hardpoints for energy weapons. On top of that, every chassis has Quirks, that give bonuses for movement, torso rotation speed, laser range, missile cooldowns etc. As I'm writing this review (Jan, 2016) there's been some rumours about the Quirks system going away somewhere in future, but I can't verify it at the moment. Personally I've always like the Quirk system, as it makes even the ""crappiest"" 'Mechs still good when compared to the best of the best Clan 'Mechs.The great thing in MWO is that you aren't limited into certain builds on every 'Mech. Once you select a 'Mech and open the loadout screen, you can fine tune pretty much everything from it and these all have advantages/disadvantages on battlefield. For example engines: you are free to tear down that small engine and replace it with a bigger, more faster engine. That'll make your 'Mech jog around faster, but bigger engine always means more weight too. More engine weight means less free tonnages available for weapon systems and other equipment. You can replace the normal STD-engines with lighter XL-engines. XL-engine weights less, but takes more space - and every 'Mech has a certain amount of free slots for equipment. On top of that the XL engine takes up space from both sides of torso too (Normal STD engine only uses center torso), so if someone punches a hole into your side torso, the engine is destroyed immediately. Destroyed engine means, blood, tears and game over.To combat the tonnage limit of every 'Mech, you can modify the chassis by replacing the stock structures with more lighter Endosteel structure. This will free up some more tonnages for armaments, but once again, takes up more space. When juggling for a balanced build for your new ultimate 'Mech, you should keep in mind that all weapons create heat too. The constant shooting of lasers for example can overheat the systems, which causes the 'Mech to shutdown. You can disable this overheat protection manually in tight spots, which basically means you can strain the system longer, keep on shooting and let your 'Mech take some punishment. If you overheat too much, it could lead into ammo explosion inside torso, which equals a wrecked 'Mech - or the weapons in your arms might explode, which usually means the losing of that arm.The possibilities are quite endless and I don't want this review turn into a full 'Mech building guide. I'm just trying to give you an idea how vast the 'Mech customizing options are. There are lots of advanced guides available in the Internet about 'Mech builds, module usage and group tactics. Some of the biggest clans also help train their pilots.Everything you do on the battlefield gains you points. This means doing damage to enemy 'Mechs, making the final killshot, assisting other with target painters, UAV drones, protecting your fellow Mechwarriors with ECM blanket etc. These points gain you pilot AND Mech experience (XP). These XP-points can be then used to unlock new modules and perks for your 'Mechs - making you better equipped and more skilled in combat. The list of the skills, modules and one-shot consumbales is quite vast, so there's no point of me listing them here.But you'll probably get the picture now. You can fine tune and micro manage alot of things in your 'Mechs. But this doesn't mean you have to. The basic loadouts are decent and there are Trial 'Mechs available for new pilots. These Trial 'Mechs change from time to time and they are a good way to give you a feeling what might work best for you.Free tipIf you're interested in the game and want to give it a spin, I'll higly recommend you first go through the tutorials. Not because ""we don't like noobs in the battlefield"". Well, we do hate it - but completing the tutorials give you a generous amount of starting capital for your first own 'Mech. And as a new player your get cadet bonus from your first 25 games, so if you go there with no idea how to play the game, you just probably f*ck up your first 10 games, get sucky points, gain less money and cadet bonus on top of that.Be a valuable asset to your team - get more points - earn more money - earn more Cadet Bonus. That'll be enough to give you a good amount of money to buy a decent 'Mech with a custom loadout. Oh, and don't accept every opinion you read as the only ""truth"". There are many ways to play this game and if some 'Mech is especially good in one thing, it doesn't mean you HAVE TO play it like that. F2P? P2WIN? C-Bill? MC?Like any other Free-To-Play game these days, MWO also has micro transactions for cosmetic stuff like colors, camo patterns, cockpit items etc. If you feel like supporting the game - or just want to save time - you can also buy 'Mech packs or MC (Mechwarrior Credits) with real money too. MC is the premium currency that you use for cosmetic purchases, but you can also unlock 'Mechs with it. On top of that, you can speed up your personal progress by buying some Premium Time, which means more XP and credits after every match. Nothing game breaking in my opinion since it still keeps the battlefield even and everything in-game can be obtained just by playing the game too. (Excluding the Hero-Mechs that offer a +30% money boost)I've been playing this game before it came into Steam around 400+hrs and that's just counting the hours in a fight. There's no telling how many hours I've been sitting in the loadout screen, fiddling with the next setup. So, it's easy to say I'm pretty addicted to this game. Mechwarrior Online is one of my long time favorites and I'll heavily recommend it to anyone who loves fictive combat simulators with a good amount of realism on the background. It takes some learning to understand the game mechanics, but it's definitely worth it!			"

												As a new player, I think MWO is great. And as a new player I notice that this game gets a lot of hate for the product it used to be, rather than what it is.As it stands, the game is generally very stable. I've been disconnected twice at the time of writing this and once was because of an earthquake at their server locations. It's a deep, tactical shooter with a lot of customization available. If you value positioning, constant map reassessment, tactics, and precision over snap accuracy then you should try MWO.The F2P model is reasonable enough, and the game is not P2W. Within the first couple dozen games, anyone can afford a top tier mech layout. I don't know if MWO is going to continue with the frequent events they've been doing, but with them the grind is much less noticable with things like mech credits (paid currency), c-bills (in game currency), and premium time all being given out for free. I'd actually say the rate at which you get new stuff is about right with these events, so it may be too slow without them.There is a little bit of an extra grind to get to the top which is with modules. Modules require global XP to learn the skills to use them and the modules cost a lot of c-bills (like as much as a new mech without being outfitted). Because of the ELO system in the game, Pilot Skill Rating (PSR), you won't really being playing against people with this gear in quick play. You will, however, be playing against these people in Community Warfare (CW).CW is a fun mode that's a nice alternative to quickplay as the objectives are no longer symmetrical. It's meant to act as the global scale war that fits in with the lore of MechWarrior. It's not fully fleshed out yet though, and the main benefit for participating is ranking up with the various factions which do have some unique rewards. But the feeling of making a true impact isn't there yet. It's also not completely balanced between the factions.Customer service has been good so far. I had an account issue that they resolved quickly, even with the holiday hours.Bottom line: MWO is fun to play, offers a good freemium model, and the company seems to have changed their mentality in running this game for the better.

												TL;DR: - If you do random decisions and are unwilling to learn in advance... do not even start this game. - If you are willing to read all that is below and much more about game, then it may be for you.- - - -Disclaimer:Instead of telling you all the good and bad stuff, You should decide for yourself.MechWarrior Online has: - 2 ""sides"": Inner Sphere, and Clans - Each side has separate modules and weapons preventing you to install ""IS"" weapon/module into ""Clan"" mech - > So study your 1st mech wisely before you buy it - There are 2 general types of mechs: Battlemechs, and Omnimechs - > Battlemech allows player to optimize Everything there is to it except types of weapon slots available on each part of mech (Including Engine power/size, armor type, inner construction material, ...) - > Omnimechs on other side comes almost allways with most of basics stuff predetermined (Fixed power/size engine, fixed armor type, inner construction, ...) - > But Omnimech offers ability to take any mechanical part from other variant of given mech (except main torso) and use that. So You can have more Laser slots as you take arm from other variant with lasers instead of rockets.Progression: - For playing matches you get reasonable amount of credits which can get you anything and everything in game - You get XP spendable directly on mech you are playing in match (Unlocks bit higher speed, cooling, rotation rate, ...) - > Mechanics: Each mech has several ""Variants"" of chasis with different weapon/equipment slots. 1st Tier of unlocks is available to every mech. 2nd Tier of unlocks becomes available only after you have 3 ""Variants"" of same mech with all Tier 1 unlocks purchased. Same goes for Tier 3. - You get tiny bit of global XP used to unlock global pilot skills/mech modules - > warning: Clan skills are not compatible with IS mechs, so if you go for Clan increased laser range, it will not fit into IS mech with lasersSize/Speed/Weaponry: - Huge ""Assault"" mechs are very slow to move,to turn and can't aim at their feet = Tiny mechs which get to their back up close can eat them if they are not protected. But they carry a lot of armor and often a lot of weapons. - ""Heavy"" Mechs are often nearly twice as fast as some Assault mechs in all ways. In some cases they can carry nearly same weaponry as Assault mechs. But always come with lower armor. - ""Medium"" mechs are kind of odd in most cases. Even lower armor than Heavies. Speed is often not that much better. Lower weight limit to carry weapons. - ""Light"" mechs on other hand are more often than not very fast and hard to hit. This benefit is paid by low armor and light short range weapons.= = = =Most important thing: - 1st steps in game: - > You read about ""IS"" vs Clan mechs incompatability. About Omnimechs vs Battlemechs difference. And about need to have 3 Variants of one mech Chassis to fully unlock all passive upgrades for mech. - > That means You will be stuck with your 1st choice for quite a while unless it was very bad pick and you sell that mech for some loss of credits - > So how to pick 1st mech? - = > Game offers ability to preview all mechs in ""shop"" and as you select them, you can go and click ""View in Mechlab"" where you can completely remove all there is from mech to see how many Tons you have for gear/armor/engine. - = > You can check what is locked and what is customizable. - = > You should look at other variants of same mech to confirm that they will be up to your different weaponry/play style choices (as you'll need 3 variants to unlock all 3 passive skill tiers to make your mech awesome as possible). - > How to buy 1st mech? - = > 1st 25 matches on account give you credit bonus which is quite nice and this bonus is moltiplied by premium time which You'll get 24hours of at account creation. This gives you 8~12M credits in total. - = > Basic Training completition gives you additional ~2.5M credits right at start. - = > Each completed match gives you credits based on your performance/team play and game mode selected. Usually between 0.1M and 0.25M credits. - = > So after 25 matches you'll have plenty to buy 3~5 variants of Light mech. 3~4 of Medium Mech. 2~3 Variants of Heavy mech. Or 1~2 variant of Assault mech. But that depends on your spending during those 25 matches on different weapons, engines, modules as that can be so expensive that you only got 1 mech and a lot of weapons you can't use at same time. So spend wisely. - = > Or you can buy Mech for real world money to support game. - = = > What applies here is same... Think before you pick your Mech(s)... Yes, Mechs. Because packages often contain 3 variants of selected mech = solving your problem with unlocking all passive skills. - = = > There are different packages on Steam and on game website - = = > Steam packages contain 2 different Chassis mechs = only 1 variant per mech, but those are ""Premium""=""Hero"" Mechs giving you additional 30% boost fo earned Credits + Steam package has premium giving you +50% credits for 30 days. That's 80% boost, so it is not so hard to get those missing variants soon enough. - = = > On other side is game shop where you can buy package of 3 variants of mech of your choice + getting 30 days premium. (No ""Hero"" variant of mech included, so if you want that additional 30% credit boost, it is additional mech and money) - = = > or there are just ""Hero"" mechs available for purchase: No premium time, just unique skin, sometimes unique weapon slots and +30% credit boost while piloting this mech. Cost of hero mech is based on weight, so Light Mech Hero comes much cheaper that Heavy one... Both on steam and game's webshop. - = = > Last option for purchasing mech is not exactly for new players: You buy ""Early Adopter pack for upcomming mech with a lot of bonuses, but it comes 4 months later when it is developed and put into game""= = = =Side notes/warnings: - Buying mech for Credits in game is instant. Buing for real world money from steam/webstore gets you your new mech on full hour. So buy 12:05 and you'll get your purchased mechs on 13:00. - You can own multiple ""Versions"" of same ""Variant"" of mech and they do not count towards passive skill unlock. - > This means that you have ""Orion"" Mech in Variant: ON1-M, ON1-K, ON1-V = 3 different Variants and allows for All passive skill unlocks. - > But if you have ""Orion"" Mech in Variant: ON1-M, ON1-K and you decide to buy ON1-K(C), that stands only for (C) version of ON1-K variant and therefore you have 2 Variants and one additional Version and no Passive Skill unlocks. - Key binding will not remove existing bind. So if you dislike 3 level of zooms on Mouse Wheel button and assign ""Max. Zoom Toggle"" to ""Mouse 3"", it will not work till you remove ""Mouse 3"" from original assignment. - Game is more limited on CPU side than on GPU, so adjusting some settings may not result in higher fps. But may result in easier gameplay. (60fps is easily achievable on average 4 years old PC.) - Game has good support team, so if you run into trouble... Contact them. (Unless 30 seconds on google reveals your solution on forums.)			"

												Mechwarrior Online is an excellent addition to the Mechwarrior series.The game is by no means perfect, so it is not entirely surprising to see so many negative reviews, but it is sad when many are ill considered rants rather than objective assessments. My favourite was someone who played over 500 hours, saying only 'worst game ever'. Completely useless review, and clearly a lie too! Gave me a good chuckle. In all seriousness it is not a game that everyone will get in to and there are some important issues to be aware of before you start.1) Configuring a Mech is complicated. I know Battletech well, but for my friends it was daunting and can be quite a put off. My advice is to persevere, the complexity keeps the game fresh for a long time to come. 2) There are only a handful of maps to play on. This can definitely be frustrating given that some maps are biased towards particular weapons loadouts. Skill still plays a huge role though, and games are short so you don't suffer long if your loadout is completely inappropriate!3) Spend as much time as you can stand with trial Mechs before spending any C-Bills. You get money rapidly per game over the first few days, then it dwindles to a trickle. You'll find your first and second Mechs really have to last you a long time so choose wisely. My advice is a Clan Heavy OmniMech such as the TimberWolf-S. OmniMechs have the most configurability, and this is essential when buying a brand new Mech costs a small fortune!4) Although definitely not Pay-to-win, as skill and teamwork always trump any minor advantages of an individual Mech, spending money is very tempting as it can really ease the grind to get new Mechs. I don't begrudge the developer wanting to make money. Every Free-to-play game does, so don't pretend they don't. Overall I have enjoyed my Mechwarrior Online experience. The ability to customise Mechs with a range of weapons, and the small advantages and disadvantages of each Mech really help to maintain interest. The gameplay is surprisingly well balanced with skillful individuals and team maneuvering being vital to winning most of the time. I'll admit to frustration at the expense of Mechs and the push to spend money. However it truly is not necessary in order to advance through the game steadily. Matches are short and frequent enough to keep your bank account growing, and there is nothing more satisfying than saving up for a new Mech. Spend money only if you really enjoy it and want to support the developer. Games don't get made for free!P.S. I thought I should add that this is one of the least toxic games I've played. After playing Dota 2 for so long, and putting up with swearing and childish tantrums, it's been a breath of fresh air to have a game where 99% of the time people talking are positive and helpful!

												As a MASSIVE mechwarrior series fan with way more hours in this game than I should have on a separate non-steam linked account, I can only begrudgingly recommend this game. Do you have a serrious adiction to mech combat? Massive fan of BattleTech? Did you play countless hours of the old Mechwarrior games? You'll probably love this and spend way too much time and money on it, knock yourself out! If you are new, be forewarned, the grind is real. If you want to get a decent collection of mechs expect to spend real money, And if you are new expect to die horribly; a lot. You only get one life per game, so the learning process is going to be a bit painful as you spend a lot of time in the lobbies between matches, and then get utterly smashed for overheating, being out of position, missing your shots, targeting the wrong components ect. The new training is nice, but once you start fighting real people you'll probably get wrecked your first 20 or so games. If you aren't a fast learner, you should probably avoid this game. Also, another con is that you won't be able to customize many mechs. You have to own mechs to customize them and they are very expensive. You dont get many mech bays to start, and you need to buy three variants of the same type of mech and grind with them to unlock the piolet traits that make a huge difference in the mechs combat effectiveness. To buy more mech bays so you can own more mechs requires premium currency as well. So if you do grind enough to buy more than a few mechs you will need to spend money. I recommend that you spend a lot of time testing the trial mechs extensively. Get a good feel for what you want to play. The trial mechs are now always champion variants as far as I can tell, and this is great because they are often the best builds possible for the given mech type. Although, “Best” is relative to the meta at the time, and understanding how to play any given mech is not exactly self-explanatory for a beginner. Still, give them a spin, figure out what you like, and start grinding. If you like the idea of slowly building up to the perfect set of mechs optimized to your taste then you might just get to see where this game really shines. Once your past noobdom, or if your a veteran of the series, the combat is as rewarding as it is challenging. If you are looking for (What IGN called) ""A thinking person's shooter"" This game is for you. Manage heat, ammo, armor, target lock, weapon groups, and target key components where enemies' main weapons are, memorize mech layouts to engage and strip them faster... On its base level, if you are a fan of huge mechs trading blows in team centric combat, this is your game.7/10 They should have just launched a real $60 title, but this is way better than nothing for another 10 years.

												I'm a veteran player who has played since Closed Beta, spent a ridiculous sum of cash on this game, and logged over 4000 matches. I'll keep the review brief for those looking to get in.Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. But a warning:* If you're a diehard Battletech fan looking for a very deep experience such as Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries or Mechwarrior 4: Mercenaries, you will not find it here.* If you're a diehard Battletech fan looking for a deathmatch shooter with Mechs and customization options that you recognize? You will find that in Mechwarrior Online.To everyone else? Give it a shot! The game is not without it's flaws, but the core gameplay is solid and a ton of fun.			"

												There's little more for me to say when so many other reviews have aptly described the issues with this game, so I'll be blunt:Try it if you really, really want to. There's no loss involved. But expect to be punished unless you're a veteran coming back or you've already spent money on the game.Since other users have already thoroughly warned you about PGI's track record (and if you haven't seen that yet, you should glance through a few negative reviews, because they're valid,) I'll focus instead on warning you on what you, as a new player, should expect to see starting out.The community is insular. They'll go on for hours and hours about how they want to be inviting and friendly, but their behavior and conduct don't reflect this. Teamplay is important, so pugs are referred to disparagingly by even the most polite of players. Most people still playing are still playing because they have intimate ties to the Battletech or Mechwarrior licenses; the game preys on their nostalgia and they in turn feed the machine and defend it from disparaging remarks. If you play other video games, expect to hear players lamenting about the ""call of duty"" crowd or other such stupid garbage - further distancing themselves from the general community of online PC gamers at large.The grind is deceptively monumental: you get a massive boost in cbills (ingame currency) via your first 25 matches and by completing the tutorial, which is generally enough to purchase (though not properly outfit) a single inner sphere mech. If you want to be on even remotely even footing with anyone else, you will need to do this three times: purchase three variants of a single mech, outfit those three variants so they're viable enough to play (stock builds are enormous garbage,) and then play them until you rack up enough experience points to grind out all their ""basic skills,"" which are flat percentage increases to your mech's performance (reduced heat generation, increased acceleration and deceleration, the works.) This will allow you access to a chassis' ""elite skills,"" which are even more powerful advantages afforded to you for greater XP cost (including increased top speed.) Unlocking all four on a variant will literally double all bonuses conferred from basic skills. Yes, you read that right. Grinding obscene amounts of experience into a mech makes it infinitely superior to the same variant, same build, piloted by a new player, regardless of player skill.After your cadet bonuses are gone, your average income per match as a new player may run anywhere from 50,000 cbills (on a loss) to 300,000 cbills (on a well-played win. You will not see this much money as a new player, as the game's mechanics are relatively complicated, poorly explained, and map design is extremely unforgiving to inexperienced players.) You can probably expect about 100k to 150k per match if you're new. Mech prices vary wildly depending on tonnage, stock loadout, and technology (a clan heavy omnimech with a gauss rifle is going to be much more expensive than an inner sphere light mech with medium lasers and machine guns.) You can expect a decent IS heavy to run you about 7-8 million cbills, then outfitting it with decent weapons, upgraded systems (endo-steel and double heat sinks are generally a must) and a good engine may cost you as much as 7 million more. You can expect a decent clan mech (the stormcrow and timber wolf, both clan mechs, are still bar-none the best vehicles in the game) to run you anywhere from 10 million to 14 million cbills, but luckily there's less to upgrade. Sure hope you know what actually performs well, though, because if you ♥♥♥♥ up and build something ♥♥♥♥♥♥, you'll be selling it back for a fraction of what it cost you.Weapon balance is comical. There exist entire weapons systems in the game that are completely useless, including machineguns and flamers. No one will tell you this, because A) PGI doesn't understand their own game and balances around a meta they know nothing about, B) the game is loaded with whales who believe themselves to be experts on the game's balance who will tout that you can pilot anything and perform well, as long as you know what you're doing (they don't.) and C) knowledge is steeply guarded by anyone who actually knows how to play the game. ""Comp"" teams are fiercely protective of their strategies and aren't about to share tips and tricks with every Tom,♥♥♥♥♥♥ and Harry fresh off of steam. There was a line from the old Battletech cartoon that the players think is a hilarious meme: ""Information is ammunition."" Well it's true, and ammunition is both in shortage and at a premium.Suffice it to say that lasers are almost universally better than any other weapon.Map design and the existence of 12v12 matches also have a massive impact on weapon balance, and very few players seem to understand this. Small arenas defined by chokepoints, DotA lanes, massive sight lines, and confusing geometry are the order of the day. Scale is confusing and map geometry frequently makes little sense (why are there rocks in the middle of river city if they offer poor protection from literally any angle? Why is forest colony so huge when there's no objective but to head straight for the middle and fight with the enemy?) Because teams are composed of 12 mechs, the key to victory is focusing targets. Even a premade composed of 12 clown-shoed morons like NKVA can stomp all over the game's population (which is likely to include you, new steam user.) The community will frequently lament the TTK (time to kill) being much too fast, blaming this on the weapons systems and completely disregarding that despite the game's glacial pace for an arena shooter, their woes can be attributed to the fact that the Smart Strategy is to move in a big blob and shoot the same target. These are the same people who sarcastically remark that ""teamwork is OP"" if you try to bring up disparities in the weapon and technology balance department.TL;DR the game is stupid, the devs are stupid, and the community is either stupid or uninterested in sharing with you how to get good. The game is enormously rewarding to those who have invested ungodly hours into it, and severely punishing of those who have not. The players and devs alike are confused at how this formula continues to drive away new blood, which the game desperately needs to survive, and don't understand why it leads to a mind-bogglingly steep pricing scheme, like paying 120 US dollars for a mech pack. But they totally want you to come revitalize their game. Because it is their game, after all. Not yours.			"

												Don't get invested in this game, that's the short version. I'll list some reasons for those who would like to know more:Incompetent devs who don't play their own game and balance it by dice and darts. Nerfs and buffs come and go, making some mechs god-like for a period and making some walking coffins. Small adjustments are rare.Core gameplay features still changing after release. Energy draw coming to replace Ghost heat (a failed, complex bandaid in its own right) after some sort of balance has finally been achieved using Ghost heat.Releasing completely untested mechs for real money, resulting sometimes in completely OP (Kodiak) and sometimes completely useless (Phoenix hawk) mechs being released.Rampant hacking and PGI has no way to deal with it. The small amount of people who have been banned, have not been detected using hacks. They have just been banned because PGI had reason to believe they were hacking.Broken promises and deadlines. For example, Community warfare (a big selling promise made very early) was supposed to be out 27th January 2013. It was released in December 2014. It was horrid then, it is horrid now. The maps are just chokepoint running where the defenders just have to wait for the attackers to walk into their guns. Russ has stated that the maps wont be redone.Every patch just adds more bugs, breaks working features (minimap fiasco, the current situation with dropdecks etc.) and very, very rarely, adds low quality content like Community warfare and all of its features, bland and similar maps, bland and similar game modes, visual reworks that kill peoples frame rates and so forth. New weapons can't be added to the game because PGI just doesn't know how to do it. And if they ever find out, they still wont do it because they won't be able to balance them.If there is something good about this game, it's the mechs. They are gorgeous.And yes, I have unholy amount of time clocked on this game. I'm an addict and I'm trying to get clean of this game. If I ever ask for mechpacks, don't buy me any. Don't buy any for yourself either.PS: I apologize for bad english, I hope this is coherent and understandable enough.			"

												Some background:  I'm a backer of this game, huge fan of Battletech and long time mechwarrior fan.  This game could have been so much more than it is and to make matters worse, the devs have largely lost the trust of the community.  So much so that very very few people were willing to fund their followup game(known as transverse).  But lets get to the positives:-The art design of the mechs is pretty nice.  Alex Iglesias nails the concept art.-Its the only mechwarrior you're going to get that isn't ancient in game industry terms.-Lots of mechs and variants to choose from and even more to customize.  -Good controls for the most part despite the defaults being goofy.  Check the options menu.-Community Warfare features are starting to turn into a fairly appealing mode.-The clan equipment sound design is top notch.  I wish the IS stuff sounded as nice.And then the negatives:-The weapon balance is awful and so many little jury rigged fixes have been placed on the system to ""fix"" the problem.  PGI's gameplay design team is horrid at math and has been since beta.-The game is growing more and more poorly optimized and it stutters on systems that used to run it silky smooth with nothing to show for it.  NVidia cards can have serious problems despite the made for nvidia intro vid advert.-The player base has largely been chased off by false promises and bad ideas so there aren't a lot of people playing the community warfare.-The game is buggy enough to be frustrating.-The community mildly toxic but not the worst.-Clan tech is implemented as though its 1:1 with IS tech and you'll be matched against it as such.-All these assets and no mechwarrior single player campaign...-The mechs are horridly out of proportion.  This makes the speed of the mechs feel extra sluggish since you're closer to 20 meters up rather than 12.  Additionally, some mechs are punished a lot more by their size.  The Centurion, for example, is heavy/assault sized despite being half the weight of the Atlas.  Mechs should be in the 8-12 meter range not 6-20 meters.  That range is insane.  Update:  The recent rescale did nothing to fix this although it did bring mechs in the same weight class more in line with each other.Hopefully you enjoy the game.  I grow quickly frustrated with the choices the design team makes.  Give the game a shot though, it is free to start playing after all.			"

												The year is 3535.  Humankind has made great progress, especially in terms of finding new and unique ways of killing one’s neighbor.  Unfortunately for the denizens of the 36th century, theirs is a future that was conceived by bored DnD players in the mid-1980s.  This is manifested in their weapons of choice: large legged robots the size of apartment buildings.  Tank treads?  Puncture-proof off-road wheels the size of a barn?  Nah.  These bots have size 357 feet, ferro-fibrous shins and thighbones made of endo-steel.  As you might guess, this makes them clunky as all get out.  They have 1987-esque optics to match.  As you lumber along on your skyscraper legs, you might see enemies peeking out over yonder hills.  You might want to flag them for your teammates.  Not happening.  Not until you can see the whites of their cockpits.  Your futuristic laser pointer has a similar range and makes a visible line that lets the enemy trace it right back to your armor-encrusted jeep-sized fist.  And when that enemy shoots at you, you do what any 36th century advanced attack platform does: flinch.The above is what makes this game absolutely awesome (or should I say atlas?).  Driving around big clunky robots makes for far more strategic combat than your typical 2016 FPS.  The least clunky robots are light mechs.   They move almost like they’re not the size of buildings.  Mediums behave kind of like the heavy in TF2.  Heavies behave like the TF2 heavy wearing concrete boots, and assaults play like the TF2 heavy with concrete boots and a concrete helmet.  What does it all mean?  It means that you need to lumber along with your teammates instead of just doing whatever you want.  It means you really need to capitalize on terrain and cover to protect yourself or creep up undetected.  Perhaps the best thing is that driving an armored skyscraper means that you have a lot of armor and will not crumple the first time you get hit.  Don’t get me wrong, there ARE snipers, but these snipers do not sit around one-shotting everything that enters their crosshairs.  I have been headshot once and scored a headshot once (totally by accident).This brings us to the mechs themselves.  You have two varieties.  The more traditional ones are like tuner cars and hot rods (Inner Sphere).  The latter are more like Italian sportscars (Clan).  One requires a lot of time and tweaking to get up to speed.  The other is pretty solid out of the box.  The great thing is that there is a vast variety, and you see people using every make and model out there.  There is, of course, a metagame, but builds beyond the meta are viable, and you have enough room to come up with something that personally works for you that may not work for the greater MWO population.  I like that.The greater MWO population is generally a friendly, well-behaved bunch.  Yes, there are some droolers and screamers, but they are a decided minority.  The community as a whole is older than you would find in most games, and the kids you encounter tend to be the ones who are grown up enough to sit at the adult table without being childish.This is a result of the gameplay.  Strategy trumps reflexes, and the game encourages you to linger after you die in order to get more assists and, while doing so, learning from watching more experienced people play out the rest of the game.  This pace is not for everyone, but I enjoy it.  In between matches, I do a combination of watching my team, researching builds, and at times surfing the net.  With a max of 15 minutes a match (and the average probably around half of that), you play the game in bite-size chunks.I really enjoyed my initial day or two with the game, but I was playing while traveling in Europe.  Living somewhere off the beaten path, I feared that the servers would not be functional from home.  I was wrong.  Pings are not as solid, but the game is still very playable, and it plays incredibly well at pings that would make other games unplayable (150+).The devs are engaged with the community.  I’m still on the fence about how this relationship is going.  After all, what online game doesn’t feature players criticizing the devs for anything and everything?  At the same time, what business entity is angelic in its handling of online games?  The good that I see is that we are now playing a game that has 3 years of development put into it.  That means those who came before me sorted out the worst problems.  The bad is that certain aspects reek of greed and price-gouging.  Paint, for example, costs more than real life paint that you would put on miniatures.  One discussion I saw about improving the HUD seemed framed by how the players would pay for such an improvement.  In the realm of neutrality, there are a lot of game modes and whatnot that may or may not be coming out in the future.  I’d love for them to be implemented, but I’m reviewing what’s there.  Furthermore, the game has the licensing from the tabletop game, which means this IS the DnD of mech games.  That is important to me because it attracts the diehard, long-term fans and thus makes me feel like this is a solid investment that will not suddenly go bust or implode.  It’s not perfect, but it’s stable.And investment brings us to money.  This is THE best f2p model I’ve ever seen.  Instead of paying to win, you pay for variety.  Variety is more meaningful to me than bling, and the variety here is compelling.  There are scores of mechs, but you get only 4 mech bays to start with.  If you want more mechs, you have to pay for more bays.  The bays are cheap.  Beyond that, there is the temptation to shop for more.  Yes, the mechs are expensive, but I get to pick and choose as opposed to being forced to pay a subscription fee or some such.  And, if I only want to pay for mech bays, I can do that, too.  The game will proceed far slower, but no one is being denied the best gear because they don’t want to pay cash for it.  Is this a grind?  Yes, but the grind is the game.  I’m enjoying the ride.  Along similar lines, even newbs are vital parts of the team, and even newbs can get out there and hurt somebody.  You aren’t out there getting the floor mopped with your corpse on your first days out, but it is obvious how little you know about builds and mechanics.  There is sooooo much to learn, and yet so much fun to be had before you actually understand the half of it.  Perhaps most importantly, understand that this game was out for years before it came to Steam, and that means most of those playing it are not visible at the Steam community hub.  The community is larger.  Not huge, but again solid.  And there ARE new people joining.  You will not be the only new arrival, and it’s not too late to get in on MWO.In short, I love this game.  If I could compare it to anything, I’d say it reminds me of the days (in fact years) I spent playing Random Arenas in Guild Wars I.  Those were good days, and it’s nice to be back in a similar place.

												So, what to say about a game that shows I have almost 500 hours logged since it arrived at steam and that I have been playing quite a while before? Simply put, I enjoy the Mechwarrior Universe where you do litle else than running around in a giant walking tank that is highly customizable. I've been playing this game since Mechwarrior II that I got with my Matrox Mystique in 1996 (oh dear) so I assume that nostalgia is one reason I keep on trucking. Of course, the Mechwarrior game is only a fraction of a much larger Battletech Universe that I find derivative and utterly boring; there are some factions at war and then there are some more and so on.Mechwarrior Online is the latest version and has improved several key items from the MW games. I cannot recall spending so much money on a free-to-play game (though you do not have to) and what you get is a game that basically never left the docks. At this moment, a new, major change is coming (again) to the game, this time new tweaks replacing old tweaks and this is pretty much how that game has been for the last years. The developer, PGI, is continously changing the game but rather than thinking it through they use hit & run tactics; it typically ends up as a large change for the worse from which they try to tweak further, loosing more players with each major change while the months tick by. Suggestions from the fiercely loyal fan base appear to be in vain and at this point I see each new patch as a weather report; you hope for clear skies, but usually, well, no luck for you.The game has been end of life for quite a while now with no other content added than new mechs, that become increasingly more expensive and usually just that little better than the previous batch. Sometimes an old map is updated, again typically made worse, and the game limps on as your battle-damaged mech would. Slowly, clumsily, and you can nearly feel the agony of its pilot. Which is me, by the way, so that comment doesn't make sense at all.The main reason I still play is because they game plays well with your fellow team mates and I've been part of a great group. Without it, I would have stopped playing years ago, because there really isn't much to do.Recommended? No, not really.			"

												This is the MechWarrior game I've been wanting since my childhood days playing MechWarrior 2. So how to describe it compared to other games? Well, it's not exactly a shooter and it's not exactly a sim. It's somewhere in between. The F2P setup is actually reasonable which is a rare thing to see, especially after my experience with World of Tanks and World of Warships and the obvious money sinks built into those. With MWO throwing money gets you nothing gameplay related that you couldn't get otherwise for free. Yes you can get cosmetic stuff, yes you can get first access to new mechs for a bit before they're available to earn for in-game currency, and yes you can buy ""hero"" mechs that give a little boost to XP earned, but little Billy with his daddy's credit card is going to get wrecked because cash won't do anything but save you time in unlocking things.Other than that, there's events for unlocking free stuff that happen on a very regular basis, and the community is actually full of (mostly) decent folks who just want to have fun blasting the crap out of each other in giant stompy robots.

												Going to leave a quick review here. Personally I think MWO is a great game. I have spent, and will continue to spend, many hours playing it. I've been a player for over 2 years now. It takes a little bit of getting used to it because of the learning curve, but if you want a first person, big, stompy 'mech battle with different types of weapons, then you should try out this game.You can drop in quick play for a 12v12 match or go into community warefare with longer matches and more 'mechs. Teamwork is a top priority. Take time to outfit your 'mechs with the right equipment for your playstyle as you go, and unlock skills with your experience points, to improve as a pilot.Pros:-Big stompy 'mechs-Good graphics and sound-Dedicated playerbase from before the Steam launch, but even more players with it-Free to play and not pay to winCons:-Steep learning curve (I stongly recommend completing the tutorial)-Technical loadouts for 'mechs can be time consuming to research or build, including the grind to get enough in-game money to purchase equipment and unlock skills (though you don't have to go too hardcore)Overall I say if you're unsure give it a try as it is free, and see if you like it yourself, because everyone is different. The community will give advice if you ask for it.So see you on the battlegrounds! o7			"

												Your mech will be made into scrap and you will feel almost powerless to the enemy. Everything will happen so fast its almost blinding. But if you keep coming back for more and practice moving your mech like its second nature you will find yourself more involved in the battles. Being able to see the enemies tactics for what they are. Then you will find your place, weather it be a light assasin removing the rear armour of a 100 ton mech who can't turn as fast as you can run or a long ranged weapon platform making the enemies think twice before leaving the safety of their cover. Personally I prefer to group up and smash into the enemy position with short range weapons and communicate with my team to single out and focus down targets until their team is split and in total disarray. This game has been through a lot of changes and still has many more to come. Anyone who says its glory days are over have not been paying attention. It is regularily updated and this game will still be in development even after Mechwarrior 5 is released in two years! Add me if you decide to join the invasion weather you will die well to spread the greatness of the clans, Stand up for the freedom of the innersphere or are only in it for the money as a mercenary. I look forward to meeting you on the battlefield.			"

												TL/DR: As a long term (~30 years now) fan of all things Battletech, MWO does some things incredibly well, but the glacial pace of progress combined with a dev team who at this point can only be described as occasionally well meaning but incompetent results in a hollow and frustrating play experience. For fans of MW2 Mercs, MW3 and MW4, sadly this is probably not the game you're looking for. I can only hope that in the future there will be more and better Battletech games.Longer version:I paid for a founders package for MWO back in September 2012, long before the game was ever available here on Steam. I paid based on the advertising that was on the MWO site at that time. I paid based on the notion that we were going to get some sort of simulation of warfare in the Battletech universe, the game being some sort of mech-simulator-lite with a long-term game based on actual war, from the grand strategic level across the Inner Sphere (and beyond) all the way down to the tactical battlefield level. The game then came out in closed beta and I was thrilled to finally be back in the cockpit of my beloved Atlas assault mech which, in one guise or another, I've been piloting since the mid 80's.So why the negative review? Several reasons. Before I get in to them, I should say that the artwork, mech design and general aesthetic of the game is the best that I've ever seen in a Battletech PC game. The chap who models the mechs, the textures etc. has done amazing work and fully deserves to find employment in any AAA game dev studio.The issues I take with the game are:1. As a founder & huge Battletech fan, and therefore having financially contributed to the very existence of both the game and PGI as a viable company, being bluntly told by a senior member of the dev team that people like me (hard core Battletech fans) are, and I quote, ""Not the target audience"" for the game felt like a brutal slap in the face. Thanks for your money, but you're not really who we're aiming the game at. Really? Really? As one of very many founders who directly contributed to enabling the game to be made, being told that felt alienating in the extreme, and was frankly very difficult to forgive. This one thing above all else still makes me feel bitter to some degree.2. The glacial pace of actual content release. As time went on it quickly became apparent that mech pack after mech pack was produced and released (for exorbitant prices, but that's another discussion) in an obvious ploy to distract the player base with shiny stuff so that fewer complaints would be made about the lack of actual content. Almost FOUR YEARS down the line, and we were given something other than endless variations on the theme of team deathmatch... A couple of months ago? Many view the game as having an unacceptably slow pace of development.3. Lack of community engagement & listening to the vocal minority. I can understand the lack of engagement on the game forum, considering how blisteringly critical it can be, and I understand that the player base has hardly ever been united on anything. That being said, the two things that come to mind on which the entire player base did agree were that nobody wanted a 3rd person view in the game and that nobody wanted a coolant flush. What happened? We got both, pointlessly wasting an unknown amount of dev time that could have been better spent on other areas of the game development.4. Communication again. There never really was any sort of 'golden period' of communication from the dev team. I thought, and continue to think, that it's inexcusable that every form of communication is used except the official game forum. Back in closed beta hundreds of early CB players made lengthy detailed threads there, suggesting features using well reasoned and polite argument. Pretty much all of it was summarily ignored. Later someone, I don't remember who, suggested that for the dev team to make more use of the forum - the official game forum - would constitute an unacceptable drain on company time. My response: utter drivel. How long does it take to type an official post on the forum? Minutes? By all means use all available means of communication, but the fact that the least engaged method is the official game forum does not exactly engender confidence in the communication abilities of the dev team.5. Game balance. Wild changes are made to weapon and mech stats with each new patch, with obviously barely any actual play testing being done. Newly released mechs are usually vastly superior to older models wihch serves only to create a power creep dynamic that essentially forces players to buy incredibly expensive new mech packs in order to remain competitive. I have no idea if this is deliberate or an unintended consequence of the inability of the dev team to play their own game to a high level.Having taken part in organised team matches and also in the solo match queue I've both been pleasantly surprised and at the same time horrified by the differences between how the game plays in team matches (e.g. MRBC games) and the actual group / solo queues.Whether or not PGI had or have passion for the BT universe is open to question. From my personal experience I think they at least did at the start of the development process. What I think is more open to debate, and what I'm starting to seriously question, is their professionalism and competence. More fool me really - had I bothered to be diligent and researched their prior history as game developers I would have been unlikely to have ever paid them a penny for anything.From a personal perspective the game as it is can certainly be fun, but I look back today at what I was lead to believe MWO would be and I can't help feeling frustration at the obvious waste of potential, broken promises and utterly incompetent PR efforts on the part of the company.If microtransaction-supported e-sport team deathmatch is what MWO is destined to become, then I'm done with the game. I will not support something that has only a thin, superficial veneer of Battletech IP over a fundamental game that I no longer derive any pleasure from playing. I never dreamed that I'd get to this point, but I'm done. I'd genuinely, dearly love to be proved wrong and see some amazing changes in the future, but from everything I've heard and read I think the direction being taken is fundamentally flawed, and certainly isn't the MWO I thought I was signing up for. Those of you who enjoy the game, more power to you, I hope you continue to do so.Original game founder signing off.			"

												(Edit: I haven't played this since sometime in May in 2014.)I was one of the original 120$ Legendary Founders back in 2012. I played this daily for 2 years, clocking in a ridiculously large amount of time and Mech collection. I watched whole clans come and go as a community spiked up over the hype then died off when the game didn't deliver. It spiral downwards since it was created. We used to talk about it coming to Steam back then, and now, only out of desperation to save this doomed product, has it finally come. This is now the THIRD release for this game. The second one was falsely touted as the first by its own creators despite already having been out for a year... and now it's releasing again on Steam. They're trying to save what I used to call a sinking ship. I'd now call it a sunken ship. Btw, the Steam version still requires you to make a MWO account... defeating any point of having been put on Steam to begin with. This port tells me that the game is finally dying, which it should have done LONG ago.But hey, since they want to port their crappy game over to Steam, I guess I'll port my review too. This is for you PGI. I still haven't forgotten the times you wiped my CBILLS bank for not liking one of my Mech builds and unnecessarily suspending me off the official forums. As I said back then, you can't censor Metacritic. That applies to Steam as well.MechWarrior Online, August 18, 2014, from my Metacritic.PGI is a horrible developer; one of the worst I've seen. They go back on every promise. They miss every deadline. They make fake pipedream promises that'll never come. They censor or ignore their own community. They totally wreck things that were already working fine beforehand. They put in garbage no one wanted like ECM, ghost heat, 3PV, and UI 2.0. These things only hurt the game, not help. But any attempt to tell them this is met with a ban hammer, assuming you get read at all. MechWarrior Online as a whole has only gotten worse since closed beta, not better. Despite being a huge fan of the MechWarrior franchise and old games, I'm not one of the many fanboys that are going to stick up for this crap of a game or developer.The most pathetic part of this game is the money grubbing. This isn't just incompetence of ""not"" knowing how to do... well... anything properly, it's shameless greed. Originally promised with no hero mechs/variants, no consumables, they did exactly that as soon as Founders refund period ended, basically saying ""shove it"" to everyone that supported them. They then made the cash shop their # 1 priority, filling it out every month with stuff to sell while features the game actually needs continue to go long over due. The stuff they did waste their time on was stuff no one wanted, like 3PV. They'd waste half a year of Dev time for 3PV. Ya, thanks, that worthless feature that shouldn't be in the game that no one wanted nor supported at any point. You wasted all that time just to shove it down everyone's throat. They didn't even deliver it with the option to queue without it as promised. They went back on a big promise by putting in something they originally promised they'd NEVER do, made a new one to do it a certain way, then didn't even bother to deliver on that one either. It also took them well over a YEAR just to put in a no-base TDM. That should have been a day 1 release mode. All that time just to copy/paste a previous mode and take the bases out. That's the level of talent we're talking about here.""Community Warfare"" is slowly becoming just an obvious pipedream. It's like being on a ship and the captain promises you that he knows where he's going and will soon hit land. Surprise, there's no land coming. It's just an inevitable sinking ship. Instead of deliver on promised features, they just make more Mech packages to milk this dying cow for all its worth before it sinks. They now offer 500$ Mech skins. Not even League of Legends did this when they made that ridiculous Ezreal skin. Blizzard doesn't even charge this much for mounts or pets. How much is the newest Blizzard title with all DLCs/optional paid content? Not 500$. You could build a gaming computer with that. The only ""Community Warfare"" for this game was on the forums, where everyone voiced their complaints to the betrayals, but was met only with deaf ears or ban hammers. During the Founder period, PGI pretended to give a crap about its community and its feedback, but as soon as the refund period ended, they stopped acting, and very obviously so. Well, unfortunately for them, they can't censor Metacritic.Please do not support this game. I'm honestly asking you because I'm a true MechWarrior fan, and this game is just one big slap in the face to us. It's an insult and abuse of the license. Worse yet is that for as long as it remains active; the longer we'll have to wait to get a true MechWarrior game again. If you support this game, you're hurting the franchise and every real fan of the series. Please let the game go bust, the sooner the better, so that the long wait for the next MechWarrior game won't be as long. PGI is a terrible company that I can only hope gets shutdown as they deserve. They belong at a Mcdonalds flipping burgers, not trying to make video games. They flat out scammed everyone and continue to try to leech as much as they can from this license's rotting corpse. This was not the revival anyone was hoping for, not even close. The license was better off in retirement. I'd rather it remain dormant and continue waiting for the next game than have a parasite dig it up just to feed on it like a vulture while ripping everyone off in the progress.I leave you with these articles if you want more evidence as to just why you shouldn't even consider giving these shameless people money. While I can't directly link, a single copy/paste into Google will find them.""What Happened to Mechwarrior Online?""""Underwhelming ‘MechWarrior Online’ Launch Falls Short of Expectations""""A Cautionary Tale: The Rage of the Mechwarrior Online Community""""Free-to-Play MechWarrior Online Offends Players With $500 Golden Mechs""""Shutdown imminent: MechWarrior Online is beyond salvaging""-Drain (Steam)			"

												I have to say this game is fantastic.  First off, I don't think it's really pay to win nearly as bad as most free to play games.  I see alot of complaints about this and I don't agree. Here are my reasons:-You start out with 4 trial mechs from each weight class (trial as in they're set loadouts, you can't customize them, that's it). So in other words, you start out with 16 mechs to try out. That's plenty for me to start with personally.-Secondly, you can purchase and customize mechs with c-bills you earn from matches.  It's not too bad really, Ten 8 minute matches got me a good mech that I was able to deck out and start getting more kills with during matches.-You really could not spend a dime and get a fulfilled mechwarrior experience from this game. I know I did for the first few weeks without spending anything. You can earn everything you need pretty quickly to get a handful of decent to good mechs going, and the game starts you out with some c-bills and some premium time. I only spent money because I started really getting into the game and decided I wanted to get some premium time going and to purchase a champion mech pack at some point. Plus, I honestly felt like the developers earned my money because the gameplay is that good.OK, let's talk about the heart of the game.  How is the actual gameplay you say?  Well, as a pretty big Battletech fan and someone who played Mechcommander and Mechwarrior 3 & 4... IT'S EFFING FANTASTIC.  God, this is the best part of the game for sure.  I love the gameplay, the visuals effects, the sound effects, the tactics and potential for teamwork, everything.  The battles are how I would imaging actual Mech Combat. The autocannons roar, lasers tear, missiles swarm.  It's so good, I love it.  Even if you're not into battletech, I think most people can appreciate the realistic feel of the mechs, and the roles of the weightclasses: assault mechs brawling, heavy mechs dishing it out, and medium and light mechs supporting. It's beautiful.  I thought Piranha Games nailed mech combat.  Also, customization is awesome and relatively balanced as far as I can tell so far. I will give a fair warning that you have to use a little patience and thought when starting out.  This isn't CoD, you don't charge in and kill.  You have to stick with your team, use cover and try to use hit and run tactics.  Also, try not to drive an Assault mech first thing, you need to work up to that to utilize it properly.  If you're not a Battletech fan, I definitely recommend this game.  If you're a Battletech fan, you have to play this game!! Alright, so I'll telly you what I think the downsides are.  The quickplay matches are a little repetitive. Not as bad as some people are saying, in my opinion the gameplay more than makes up for it.  That said, there are about 8 or so maps currently, and 3 game modes (assault, conquest, and team deathmatch). It could use a little spicing up for sure. Games typically last 5 to 15 minutes.  However - this is only the quickplay version of the game.  The main feature of the game takes place in the form of faction play, which I'm only beginning to get into and understand.  This gameplay takes place in the form of territory conquest in via assault and defence of planets.  This form of gameplay definitely has some more meat to it.  For instance one game mode takes place in the form of defending a base with friendly defense turrets and gates at the front (highly reminiscent of mechcommander i thought) which was awesome.  This is pretty cool, but my problem with faction play so far is it seems more than a little elitist (tons of premades and clans steamrolling PUGs) and not only that but it seems very difficult to break into. Like, it feels like in order to get serious about faction play, I have to prove I'm good enough to join some group that meets every Sunday, etc. Don't like that, a little too reminiscent of WoW or some other mmo for me.  This part of the game is probably a little more pay to win, or, invest a ton of time and reading online forums to win.  I don't like that too much.  The game doesn't explain the faction play very well at all, and the interface is kind of a mess and overloading the player with options.  You have to look it all up online to learn anything.  Anyways, despite a few things I don't care for, I think this game is great.  I'd give it a solid 9/10 to anyone interested in picking this game up.			"

												I've played MWO since closed Beta, over 3 years, and I love it. After playing for all this time, I can easily say that MWO has had better staying power than nearly any other computer game I've ever played. I also, for the most part, like the MWO community. I've met some great friends and have a lot of fun playing with them. Although, you don't have to join a group to have fun. I've had hundreds of great games playing solo.The ability to customize your mech to fit your chosen game style is great. Scout, brawler, sniper, missile boat, leader or follower. Fast mechs, slow mechs, big mechs or small mechs. Lasers, canons, missiles, or support roles like NARC, ECM, and tag. The game has some real depth to it, and the developers continually work to make it better. My experience with the support team has been good (and I really have had to work with them on some connection issues). It's not like most shooters, where your life span is measured in seconds. In games like Halo and COD, I always disliked that the average life span seemed to be 10 seconds or less. In MWO you can live for several minutes while taking fire and get into some insane brawls with opposing mechs. Minor mistakes can be overcome (provided your mistake isn't walking smack into the middle of the opposing team) and you can really make a difference to your side's success even after half your mech is blown off.Having said that, the game does have a learning curve. There can be real depth to the gameplay. Teamwork is very key. You have to watch your position relative to your team, your enemy, and the map itself. Some locations on the maps are better than others, and you'll have to discover them. You have to pay attention to your heat, your mechs armor and internal structure, your weapon status, and to be a good player you also have to pay close attention to your opponents status and aim with precision at where they are weakest; all the while maneuvering as best you can to absorb incoming fire while delivering your own. The tutorial is pretty good and a must for new players. Several of the existing player groups will also welcome new players and help you learn. I know mine will. If you can, get into one of the teamspeak rooms and ask around, or look at the gaming fourms in the faction groups. Most players are helpful in answering honest questions. I would recommend premium time at a minimum if you're serious about playing. The 50% boost to Cbills and expierence really add a great deal over time and let you customize your mechs in a relatively short time. I would also recommend you find what kind of mech you like and then give a Hero Mech a try. The Hero Mechs give Cbill and experience bonuses that stack with the premium time. Make money with a Hero Mech and you can purchase and kit out your garage nicely without having to pay a dime more. I have way over a hundred mechs, and most of them were purchased for free, with Cbills earned in the game (or even given away by the developers during special weekend events!).Of course, some mechs are better than others, and there's always going to be ""meta"" mechs and builds that are at the top, but the developers really have done a pretty good job of balancing the mechs. The game is definitely NOT pay to win. The Hero Mechs and Premium time ease the grind, but they are not an ""I win button."" I love that it doesn't matter so much if you are in a light, heavy, or assault mech, if you are a good pilot and play it right, you can beat your opponent regardless of what they are driving. So long as you don't take yourself too seriously (remember, it's a game!) you can have fun with all of the mechs, and there are a ton of them to choose from.So what don't I like? I wish the game had better visuals and sound effects for internal ammo explosions (basically the MWO version of a critical hit where ammunication inside a mech starts to explode). I wish some of the original iconic mechs, like the capapult, looked and played like they did in closed Beta (give me back that torso twist and the monster PPC barrels!). I also wish that scouting and support roles gave more rewards than they do now. Oh, and I hate how the gauss rifle works. Other than that, I'd say I'm extremely satisfied in my experience with the game.One other point to add is that this game is pretty sanitary for a young person if you are a parent and concerned about your kids watching and/or playing violent games. There's no blood; no humans with guns killing other humans with guns (or worse). It's giant stompy robots blowing up other giant stompy robots, so the sense of human on human violence is much less than other first person shooters.So, if you like first person shooters and are looking for a game with great gameplay, good graphics and more than the ten second life-span of HALO and COD, the game is one you should give a chance. It's free to try, so you have nothing to lose, and alot to gain. Good luck, and see you in the next drop!			"

												I have played MW, MW2, MW3, MW4, its expansions (including MechTek) and the Mech Commander games.  MW4's multi-player PvP was awesome and all of the above were great games... MWO sadly is not.I really wanted to like this game and gave it a solid try, however it is nothing but a PVP grind designed to tempt fans into forking over money so they can experience their favorite battlemechs.  The assets and design are fantastic and beautiful works of art.  There is so much potential to use them to make a proper Mechwarrior game.  Right now the assets are used to charge fans ~$10-30 a mech (or a very very long grind).  Why anyone would use their money to buy these and not better games on Steam is beyond me.I love Battletech, but you PGI have turned it into an empty shell with only pretty graphics and no substance.  We have TWO options: PUGs or CW with forced 12v12: turning every game into a pop-tart shooting contest – where is the fun in that?  Shame on all of you (except your artists, they did a phenomenal job).Hopefully Harebrained Schemes can redeem Battletech with their new project.			"

												Probably the coolest and most realistic MechWarrior to date besides their upcoming game announced at Mech Con. Pros:- Lots of customization- Pretty to look at- The devs constantly give free stuff away by way of in-game events (currency, parts and entire mechs)- Can obtain everything by being completely free to play (buy to play mechs are only available in such a capacity for a limited time before their purchasable through the in-game currency)Cons:- No tank tracks for legs like the Armored Core games (used to be my personal favorite)- Public groups sometimes get stuck dealing with 8-12 man premades- There's no Co-Op campaign or any other sort of campaign period			"

												I joined closed beta in June 2012 and havent stopped playing since then. I have logged thousands of matches and have spent a few hundred bucks on the game. That said, you'd think I could offer up a recommendation for this game, but I cant really do that. It's literally only the fact that it is a Battletech related game that has kept me involved and willing to deal with the multitude of issues MWO has.The most prominent of these is the developer, PGI itself. Much of their more malicious and disengenuous history can be atrributed to the earlier years with IGP calling shots ($500 mech packs for just a golden skin spring to mind) but the absolute glacial progress MWO shows is the most grevious. Its been 3 years and MWO is still just an arena shooter, with next to no actual lore involved in regular gameplay beyond the mechs themselves. Community Warfare attempts to simulate the actual struggle between the IS and Clan forces, but its shortcomings are vast. The game mode itself is extremely limited with extremely unrealistic (an illogical) goals in place in each round. It allows no seperation between solo players and united 12 man groups, something you'd be hard pressed to encounter in any decent online game. Absolute miniscule, extremely necessary changes take weeks, even months to be implemented or corrected. PGI has a now legendary history of being completely incapable of small tweaks to balance. Instead, large and sweeping changes are made despite extremely vocal player feedback in test servers. The users who frequent the MWO forums often provide spreadsheets and their own data collection, with reasoned and well versed feedback as to how to make MWO balance better and fair, and it falls on deaf ears.I dont want to include PGI's pricing scheme in this review, as Im sure it will be mentioned over and over. At the end of the day, I dont think the value even begins to approach what you get, especially when it seems like so little progress gets made. In no exaggerated terms, as someone who has played from the very beginning, MWO is different now after three years of progress: There are more mechs, more (but not many) maps, far worse graphics, more Cockpit novelty items, and a broken community warfare module. It's primary mode of play is still arena shooter, despite having three different ways of calling it (Assault, skirmish, conquest). There is no depth to any of these modes, and no attempt has been made to fix that after all these years.Despite all of these shortcomings, I continue to play because Ive played Mechwarrior games since 1995. As soon as someone else is given the chance to make a Mechwarrior game, I will wholeheartedly jump ship, because I have a hard time imagining another company could do so little with so much time with the Mechwarrior license.

												I have been playing MWO for quite some time. I am not a hardcore fan. I did play MW on the Playstation and PC back in the 90s.MWO is a great game, there aren't many around, not many games that are not pay to win. A lot of cosmetics to your mechs and plenty of discounts and freebies. If you love Mechs or if you watched Pacific Rim and felt like you want a mech game I really do recommend MWO.Bear in mind that the Mechs are sluggish, they are huge mechs after all, they also behave like tanks, legs and torso move independently. The game is quite similar with World of franchise.In regards to gameplay, you can customise your mech with any weapons mods and gear you wish which is great as you will never meet the exact same mech on the battlefield. This is where the fun starts. There is no cookie cutter build, some would argue but really there isn't and I suggest to experiment and play YOUR way. Especially if you PUG and don't join a serious Clan. I did but I didn't like the fact they were dictating my mech set-up.Quick do and don't list:DO stick together with your team, else going alone you will get picked up and you will die.DON'T go alone unless you are very confident and you play a fast scouting mech, light/medium mech.DO quit the match once dead as you can start a new one without having to wait until end of match (something I did not know and wasted so much time looking at my team play, then again by doing so I did learn about mech setups and strategy)DO experiment with your mech, don't listen to people saying an Assault mech should not have LRMs. Many of the maps in MWO are LRM firendly. After all how will you get LRM 60+ if not fitting on an Assault mech?DON'T listen to Assault should never have LRMs on them.DO use LRM (homing missiles) when you first start playing regardless of the mech you use, it is a noob friendly weapon, hell it is a any player friendly weapon and you will do massive damage.DON'T go for Heavy mechs they are over used and will take forever to queue for a match. Also they take an Assault class spot.DO manage your heat, try to have rating of at least 1 heat management if not 1.2+DON'T fire all your weapons like crazy, get heat spikes and shut down, you will die. Cycle your weapons if you must and go for double heat sinks but bear in mind they take 3 slots. You will be surprised how efficient it is firing 3 4 5 LRM's by cycling (BACKSPACE key) than all at once. Same goes for lasers if you overheat.DO Lock your targets, ALWAYS, no matter what mech you are in. You help others see the target and LRMs hit it. It also helps you see where the target is damaged so you can do even more damage by hitting the same locations.DO check your weapons details, especially range. Some weapons have a minimum range so if you shoot them at close range they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. You would be surprised how many people shoot PPCs and LRMs at close range. Others that shoot them hoping to get people at 2Km distance:(DON'T test you weapons when you enter a game, you will just shoot your team mates and cause friendly fire. Use the Testing Grounds or If you must turn around find a safe area and do it but remember you will waste ammo if you use ammo. That 10 ammo wasted could make a difference when you have none left.DON'T block your team mates, and DON'T be a hero going first hoping to get them kills by blocking everyone behind you. You might get a kill but will also die and cause others to friendly fire you. I had highest damage in the game without any kills (you also get an achievd for this). Even with plenty kills your rating can be lower than someone that killed none but did most damage.MECHS: Remember you need 3 different mech variants to level them up. If you buy a medium as your first mech you need to buy it's borthers too (2 more). You have to play all 3 variants get XP and level them up. There are 3 levels, most important ones are 1 and 2 as 3 only unlocks a new module slot. I would suggest going for the heat management skills first 750 and 1000 XP, then the 3500XP which does rotation.LIGHTS: I have a few but I don't really enjoy playing them. Hit and run tactics, scouts, you will die very fast, frustrating for new players and for old. Can have a light 5x5LRM which is a trolling build but fun as hell. 8 9 medium lasers which wil do a lot of damage but do bear in mind that you have to constantly move and if you go toe a toe with any other mech you gotta circle it, move legs and torso independently to run circles around that mech. Something I can't do well.MEDIUM: Similar to Lights but can be fun, they are quite fast and can pack a punch, would be used mainly as hit and runs, brawlers or LRM. You will be surprised how much damage 5x5LRMs can do (over 1000 damage in a match). You are an LRM boat that can move around the battlefield at 80 to 100 Kph. Can fit a number of high damage weapons. IE: Cicada with 4 ER Large Lasers which will be a great sniper.HEAVY: My first mech was a heavy, the CAT, a lovely LRM boat, all I did was sit back and shoot a rain of missiles on my enemies:) I have the least Heavy mechs than any other one. They are great but everyone is using them and it takes FOREVER to queue up for games. As I mentioned earlier they also take 1 assault spot from the team.ASSAULT: Well, what can I say about these walking fortresses. They pack a punch and can take quite a few. Just remember to stick with other mechs, mediums lights especially as they can protect you. You will be surprised how fast an Assault mech can go down if even 1 good light pilot starts running circles around you and shooting your legs. As you will need 3 different versions of the same mech I say have at least 1 LRM boat. When people say it is a waste of 100 tons, I say well my score and damage says something else. So many maps now are long ranged that if you have any other weapons you are a waste of 100 tons, especially the snow maps which everyone selects because they cannot manage their heat or because they are LRM or long range weapons.As I said, experiment, you have 3 different versions of the same mech variant so you might as well go nuts. Put 10 medium lasers on an assault, 8 medium pulse lasers on another, 4 x 15 LRMs, 4 x LBX10 or 4 x 20LRMs. Same on heavy or mediums. By all means if you do not wish to get 3 variants, you don't have to, just level that mech up to level 1 of the skill tier and you are sorted. Since you will be making more money at start I would suggest to get an Assault mech first. Get one that has the weapons you need so you don't spend even more money on upgrades. Test the trial ones and remember if you buy the trial mech you have been using, it has the XP saved which is great as it can be used for skills once unlocked.I would say to go for a Heavy mech first but due to longer queues it will take you longer to make the money back so I say get an Assault first then a Medium and a light if you fancy that (run the trial mechs first for as long as you need as it will help you decide which you prefer and you will also see the difference in queue times for the different mech sizes).

												MechWarrior Online is a game of thirds. 1 third is the actual game, i.e. using giant stomping mechs to shoot lasers, cannons and missiles at other mechs. The next third is build said mechs, the mech lab and coming up with builds is one of the best parts of the game. It isn't like most other games, you can make terrible mechs if you don't know what you are doing, but if you know your strengths you can make amazing mechs. The final third of the game is the people, I didn't enjoy MWO initially because I was playing on my own. I connected to the Comstar NA team speak channel and just met people who also play MWO and had a great time. I also lurked and eventually contributed to the forums at http://www.mechspecs.com and I enjoyed the game even more.You can drop some real money in the game to buy mechs, and I recommend you do to support the game, but you don't have to because there is no ""Pay To Win"" aspect of the game.I've spent more time playing MWO than any game I have ever owned and I still keep coming back for more. Highly recommended.			"

												I'll give it a thumbs up because the game is free, and what it does it does very well. butIt's really a pity that it is little more than arena deathmatch. Battles are glorious, mechs are awesome and the tactical level is very well done. Customizing your mech is fun. But that's it, there is no real ""reason"" to do things. Why am I on this planet, who are these guys, what's going on? Even ""faction play"" is little more than slap your name on a planet with no real consequences. No repairs or maintenance, so no consequences for loosing/dying. No salvage after a battle, no loosing mechs permanently. So basically, why go to battle? To grind money for another mech, or a piece of equipment, so you can grind money better for another mech or another weapon and..so on. This games lacks logistics, economy, more player interaction, a sense of real ownership and development. In a word, it has the tactics right, but it completely lacks the strategic side. Maybe the game is going to be updated in the future. In the meantime, it's a pity. But it's good. But it could be better. lol			"

												A multi-layered cooperative tactical first person shooter. Your skill matters, but so do your choices regarding what weapons and equipment to put on your battlemech. Instead of being able to respawn, you have a durable giant stompy robot. Armor protects your internal structures (legs, arms, torsos, head) and components, and 'mechs are often able to stay in the fight with multiple destroyed sections. There are a variety of weapon systems, covering short & long range, and burst or steady damage -- with a cooldown & heat management system to keep you from firing all the weapons all the time. Battle awareness and communication play are crucial, as you work with 11 other players to encounter and destroy a roughly even opposing force of 12 rival pilots. There is a full spectrum of mech sizes (20 ton ""light 'mechs"" to 100 ton ""assault 'mechs"") that slot into a variety of roles (scout, close range brawler, mid range fire support, indirect long range fire support, long range sniper) that are needed in every battle, and rewarded for doing the job well.This game can be frustrating at time, and seems to have a fairly steep learning curve, but rewards strategic (loadout, map & mech knowledge) and tactical (positioning, targeting, communication) skills and keeps me coming back for the challenge and variety.

												For those new to mechwarrior, allow me to provide an introduction.These are not ultra fast, missile dodging anime style mecha.  These are big slow stompy deathbots that will get hit by hundreds of missiles, get annoyed and fire back.  Fast kills are rare, instant kills are extremely rare.A battlemech is a 20-100 ton battle machine.  Each section of the mech has it's own independant health, and you can lose most of them without dying.  For example, if you are running a standard type engine you can lose both arms, one leg, your left torso and your right torso and still keep fighting.  You get to customize everything.  We're not talking putting skins on your guns, we're talking what guns do you want to carry where, how many rounds for each, how many heat sinks to keep the machine from getting to hot?  What size engine?  How much armor on your left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm, head, left torso, right torso, center torso, left tear torso, right rear torso, center rear torso?  - oh yeah, you get to paint everything too if you still care.Teamwork is the deciding factor in matches, the nature of the machines and how they move and take damage means that even the most skilled player can't overcome a team that abandons them to the enemy.  Putting your team in a bad spot will lose the match even if you are better shots than they are.  This is chess with more layers of complexity.Play intergalactic war.  There are 10 factions vying for control of the universe, pick one and start claiming entire planets in their name as you fight your way across the galaxy.  Now that you have the basics, here's the details on how this game has been.  I joined in closed beta and have been an active player the entire time, including all the massive meltdowns caused by actions of the publisher.  These incidents are incrediby public and easy to look up.  Yes, they earned a bad rep.However, the game itself is quite fun.  It is not pay to win - the cash only mechs are not inherently better.  Different, but not better than the ones you can get for free.  If anything this game is only pay not to grind, which is fine.Honest final recommendation?  If you are tired of fast action, actually want to see who is shooting you, and want to actually fight the other guy give this a shot.  If you like it, then put in a few bucks for a pack of mechs, skip a ton of grinding and enjoy yourself.  Also, join a team.  If you don't join a team, you will get constantly stomped in the community warfare mode.  Cannot stress this enough - no team, don't join CW.			"

												Mech warrior online is a thinking mans shooter based on the Battle Tech system.You have to select what parts of your mech are armored the most.You have to select what type of weapons to install on your hard points.You have to setup good cooling, or you will not enjoy this game, anything above value 1.1.For new users I would recommend nothing below value 1.3 cooling.You have to decide which mech is right for you.A light mech with the best speed, low armor, superior maneuverability, most often jump jets. Little room for cooling.A medium mech with balanced armor, slightly more fire power, good speed, and lesser to great maneuverability. Some times has jump jets, has a good balance for adding heat sinks and pretty much any equipment you may need.A heavy mech, the back bone of mech warrior arsenal, great armor, slower movement, and low to lesser maneuverability. Fewer heavy mechs have jump jets. You will have to decide what is more important. A higher alpha stike with higher heat spikes, or better sustained fire with very balanced heat.An assault mech can have the most fire power, the highest armor, slowest speed, and poor to very poor maneuverability. Very rare to use jump jets in an assault. Heating a cooling on these mechs is completly custom and up to the user.RolesLight mechs often are the tie breaker of any match. If you take out the enemy light lance early on you have almost full control over the battlefield during the course of any match. Lights are the bane of assault mechs. Light mechs are the scouts and the ace in pocket for advanced users.Medium mech are great for support. They can take a few more hits than the lights and are well balanced to fullfil almost any role long range or short, scouting, sniping, anti missle. You name it there is a meduim mech that can do it, they just make poor battle tanks.Heavy mechs are the real bread & butter of battle tech. Not always slowed down by a massive amount of armor and the can carry enough fire power to topple almost any mech in seconds 1v1. Heavy mechs also are some of the hottest mechs in the game, so beware of cooling issues.The assault mech is more than a tank. If built right, an assault mech can wipe out an entire lance quickly, but their slower speed and poor maneuverability make them prime targets for enemy light mechs and lrms. Do not chase the squirrels in an assault mech it will always end badly for you. If you have a squirrel climbing up your leg, call out to your team for assistance, or you better pray a lucky snap shot can take dispatch them quickly, otherwise your SOL.Very immportant words,, STAY WITH YOUR TEAM or die alone.Any first time player should stick with Inner Sphere medium or light mechs for the best playable experiance, they dont cost much but the equipment to add to them can cost a bit more than the mech alone.Plus the Inner Sphere light's have the most customization and max speed of all current mechs.Then work your way into a medium, heavy, or better, or even Clan mechs. The bigger the mech the slower it is and the bigger target you are for the other team. Light and fast is what I enjoy the most.I can not recommend Clan mechs for new players. The clan mech are sometimes gimped on tonnage for custom equipment because you can not change your engine on the common omni varients, and the heat build up is sky high. They do have better range and more custom hard points, but the heat build up is crazy, not easy to balance max fire power with max cooling. The max cooling is never enough for a Clan mech. The Origin ii c mechs trade omni pods (custom hardpoints) for the ability to change engines. They actually work quite well and can be cooled very well.Hope this post was helpful, and do remember to torso twist.			"

												Disgusting butchering of the original mechwarrior series, crowdfunded as a mechwarrior 5 game that turned into a freemium money maker aiming for the esports audience (for some reason)Mechanic wise it is a dumbed down version of mw4, which was already a simpler mw gameThe only game modes available are different variations of straight pvp matches, (walk forward until you see the enemy) and base defense, which is a regular pvp match with only 3 mechs to deploy and a wall in the middle of the way, which is destroyed in less than 2 minutesOnly a handful of maps available, and they only contain mechs. No structures to resupply/repair/DESTROY, no military vehicles or aircraft, but you can pay to get a one use artillery strikeThe powercreep is growing exponentiallyCoolant is a consumable item. WhyHorrible grinding, pay2win barrier Horrible graphics design. All mechs look like they were built using the same 5 pieces of legosIt is free, you can download it and enjoy it for a while until all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t overwhelms you, just dont spend money on it. The basic mechanics had the potential to be a decent mw experience, but it's all buried under layers of ''balanced matchmaking esports fp2 experience''. It is another example of a good idea ruined by the freemium standars, and like all the f2p games following these standars, it took all the money it could and started to lose playerbase quicklyThere are alternatives to this game if you feel the need to pilot a giant mech. Mechwarrior living legends for example, even if it's still unpolished, is what this game should've been and it was accomplished by a small team. Mechwarrior 4 still has some online matches going using the mektek packs "

												As a member of this community for nearly 3 years, I can confidently say that this game is worth your time.  It has had its up's and down's, even dissolved the original publisher (IGP).  But thats all in the past, lets talk about what the game is now.-- MWO Smurfy Mechlab is your best friend! -- I highly recommend using this site to build mechs before you spend your hard earned c-bills.The Good -Lots of stompy mechs (300+)Amazing CustomizationGood core gameplayGood beginner tutorialThe audio is pretty good.Graphically it is pretty good, however the pilot model should updated at some point.It is not a pay to win game, the pay features are to earn c-bills faster, the paid hero mechs aren't any better than the standard mechs, aside from earning 30% more c-bills.As long as you take your time in this game and dont just rush everything, you will do fine.The Bad - Mechbays are not easy to aquire for new players.  You get them from Community Warfare, events, or buy them.  However if you are enjoying the game, mechbays ARE worth the cost.Community Warfare - It is in beta and it IS being worked on.  If you want to try Community Warfare as a solo player, or in a small casual group, it can be quite frustrating. Especially when going against organized teams.Some of the free content is behind Community Warfare.  Example : Rank 2 of any faction gets you a mechbay.No tutorial for the mechlab / customizing mechs.  And no way to test the loadout before your purchase.Some information can be difficult to find.There is a lot of information to absorb in this game, and it can be overwhelming to some.  I am NOT adding balance to this list, because balance will always be changing.MechWarrior Online has been going through some massive changes in the last year, after the removal of IGP.  Rebalancing will always be an issue, nothing will ever be perfect, this is the nature of an ever changing game.  They have been adding more and more content and attempting to make Community Warfare something that we can all enjoy.  just take the game slowly, it is a bit of a grind to get heavier mechs, but it will be worth it if you are patient.Also if you have issues piloting your mech, drive it like a tank, its the same concept.

												As a veteran player, a long time Mechwarrior fan, one of the first 600 players to sign up in 2011, and a closed beta tester I will say that this game is a disappointment. The in-game new user experience is still dire after 3 years of the game being active. As of this year a new tutorial system has finally been implemented which helps players with movement, shooting, and controls but there still no in-game tutorial on how to navigate the MechLab (where you spend a good deal of time and build/customize 'Mechs). You're at the whims of the community on this one and will need to spend time reading guides and researching player suggested builds, which may be outdated or include biases. Since the MechLab is where you spend money (in-game and real), there's a good chance as a new player that you may spend money on the wrong thing and waste your time and money. The overall gameplay once you get past the customization is shallow. In closed beta it was quickly found that the most optimal strategy was to ball up as a team and have everyone target one enemy 'Mech at a time as this would kill them quicker. This creates a snowball where once one team suffers one or two losses it's very hard to bounce back. This is the extent of strategy and tactics years later. It becomes quite repetitive.Even though there are several game modes they all just devolve into team deathmatch, and some people even get real mad if you decide to play to the game mode objectives instead of just fighting.Community Warfare, which sounds like it would be the main draw to the game, is just an afterthought. It's a bland Attack/Defend gamemode that, like the other modes, devolves into a deathmatch. Objectives are usually ignored. It has such a low population that it's tough to find matches at certain hours, and the matchmaking system has pretty much been stripped out and geared towards 'hardcore' players, which means if you decide to play some matches you'll be going up against veterans with years of experience and hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of kit.Visually the game used to look better. There was better damage modeling, the animation was better, and much of that deteriorated or was actively removed from the game in patches for some unknown reason. Some of it I'm sure was for performance reasons, but some of the changes over the years were baffling.Overall, it's a disappointing game when you compare it to what it used to be and what it could have been.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially with so many other great games on Steam.			"

												PAYWALL: No. There isn't a paywall, it's not P2W. Let me elaborate: When you first create an account, your first twenty missions each will reward a buttload of cash. More than enough to buy ANY mech in the game of your choice off the bat. After your first mech, the boost goes away which does lead into a grind, but that's in any game. For instance, a match on average gives you 100,000 C-bills. Most mechs can range between 6million to 14 million depending on the faction and its weight ratios. These are daunting looking numbers, but they're not as bad if you managed to get your favorite mech with your starter money.In my personal experience, being a big fan of the Timberwolf from previous mechwarrior titles (Mad Cat) I saved my noob bonuses until I had enough to buy one. I was beyond words with my excitement, and found myself forgetting an economy even existed. Why would I care? I got my favorite mech. Naturally I started looking at other mechs, and by then I had played my Mad Cat so much that I had enough C-bills to buy them. So yes, it's a grind. But they give you some lube by letting you choose a mech to start your grind with.They even have ""starter"" mechs which are builds the Devs make themselves that you can use free of cost. And they're by no means bad, either. Edit: Not entirely true. As someone pointed out to me, the trial mechs are builds created and voted on by the Community, not the devs.Moving on from the noob experiences, gameplay is actually quite fun. It's intense enough to have you on the edge of your seat but simple enough to where you can actually take your time and enjoy it. The learning curve isn't as rough as other games, and Mechwarrior is easy to sit behind in terms of actually piloting the mechs.Enagements can lead to being fast, agile light mechs attempting to weave between the armored titans and strike at their weaker rear armor to playing the massive skulking titans and delivering devistating volleys into your enemies. Keep in mind, however, that it is a TEAM game and that the biggest may not always be the best mech for the job unless you're working with your team.Customization on the other hand can be daunting, so I suggest maybe watching a quick guide if you're planning to play.

												As far as f2p games goes, this is one of my all-time favorites.  You can get a vast selection of mechs that you can purchase with in game money.  The mechs allow you to add a variety of weapons as well as adjust perks (such as seismic sensors) and adjust armor slots.  Their business plan is fair and you don't have to spend any real world money to be completive.  The most important thing to mention for those who are thinking about downloading this is that this game requires teamwork to be successful.  If you decided to go out on your own, you will die nearly every time.  Stay with a group, call targets, focus fire.  This isn't call of duty son.   "

												'Mech Warrior Online is an incredible shooter that, while not as 'simulation' heavy as the older titles in the series, still ends up coming out feeling like the only decent 'Mech Simulator on the market for the last 10 years. Forget that Hawken junk.'Mech Warrior Online is set in the battletech universe and as such brings 30 years worth of history and lore with it, though admittedly most of is left on the table and instead you're given a solid, action packed shooter that focuses on what matters: The 'Mechs. And it pulls the combat off excellently. No absured spotting mechanic that plagues these kind of games, no stupid dice rolls and 24% deviance on impact, no sloping and facing that unrealistically bounces shots (Thoug this skill is replaces with your own skills at spreading damage) and of course, no Russian Bias.BALANCE, as with most shooters is a hard thing to talk about. It's constantly in flux and tryhards always use the current meta builds that weild the most damage in a single strike and nothing else. However saying that, balance is in the best place it's ever been for a long long time. Sure there are still some usless weapons (Flame throwerers) but now it's more about what works on your 'Mech rather than how many of weapon X you can squeeze on. I have never once found a death in MWO to be annoying or 'cheap' in MWO. Something I don't think any other game can claim.'Mechs themselves are also generally well balanced however there are 'Mechs that are simply better than others in certain weight catagories. They usually have tradeoffs, and many of the ""Worse"" Inner Sphere 'Mechs have ""Quirks"" to make them more appealing, like better refire rate on a weapon, more range, more damage, etc. You'll never disregard a 'Mech as fodder when it runs at you, but there are certainly others you'll back away from while calling to your team for help.MAPS are generally all good in the regular queue. The maps that the community dislikes are being remade with new features added to them and old design issues ironed out and the rest of the maps are for the most part perfectly fine. Everyone has their own favorites but there are no maps that are beyond unplayable and straight up unfair . You'll never find yourself spawning in and thinking ""Oh no I'm at this side of the map"" at least.And the big one: MICRO TRANSACTIONS\PAY WAL. Long and short there ain't one. It can be a bit grindy to get up to speed, it can feel like a chore to master a 'Mech you've grown to dislike and it can feel like you're so far away from earning that next 'Mech, but it certainly achivable and easily done for free. I have been playing this as a Legendary Founder since day 1 with a friend, who has never every, beyond that first payment put a further penny into the game and he currently has around 80+ 'Mechs. If you do pay, it's going to make your life easier, wether it be getting 'Mechs from packs or enjoying the benifits of premium time or perhaps a hero 'Mech (A middling 'Mech on a partcular chassis, only used because they generate 30% more C-bills.) but there are no guns or 'Mechs that you can never have sooner or later.Pay responsibly!And now a little newbie guide:A new player should hop in the tutorial and complete that, trying to score gold in the movement challenge before moving on to the main game. In the game you'll now get 25 matches that will grant bonus C-Bills known as a cadet bonus. Use these 25 games to get a feel for movment, positioning and managing heat in a range of chassis weights but do not spend a penny of your C-Bills until you get all 25 games done. You should come out with between 15-19 million depending on how well you did. This will let you get pretty much anything you like and I personally would recommend either the Timberwolf or Stormcrow, two very forgiving and powerful units.A new player should stay _far_ away from Assault 'Mechs and should really really think about if they can handle a light before jumping on it. From here you can now customise your 'Mechs though it's likely going to take a handful of games to earn enough money to do that. Be sure to spend your 'Mech XP in the Skills tab after each game and then use that 'Mech to build up a large stockpile of cash, once you've got three of the same Chassis (But different Mechs, so like TBR-Prime, TBR-C and TBR-D) all skilled up you'll be able to do the Elite catagory of skills and from here you should be able to fend for yourself.Now find a unit!Good luck, 'Mech Warriors!!

												I've been playing MWO for around three years now. During that period it would be fair to say that the game has seen some ups and downs. However, over the last year or so, the game has got noticably better and it seems this trend is likely to continue.The things are like about it are*The combat is extremely deep, and tactical. The ability to specifically target different components to destroy or disable a mech is absolutely brilliantly done*The building of mechs. You can totally customise every single mech to your playstyle and liking*Balance. This game was horribly unbalanced between Clan Mechs and IS for a long time, but its better than it has ever been before currently*Strategy and teamwork. This game rewards intelligence and teamwork over quick reflexes and lone wolfing.The things I think could use some work are:*Maps. I'd like to see more maps*Community Warfare. Currently is too complicated and takes too long to find a game for casuals*The graphics. Some parts of the game look great, some like dire. Needs more polish overall.*There are still some terrible bugs that need fixing (like the stairs on Viridian bog)But overall, the game is great fun, and probably my most consistantly played game of the last few years. The learning curve is steep, but I urge anyone with an interest in big stompy mechs exploding to give it a go.Reactor....online.....systems.....online.....weapons..... online...... All systems nominal! See you on the battlefield, pilots! "

												I'll preface this by saying that there are a lot of problems with Mechwarrior Online. Some things just don't seem to act right, the economy -feels- F2P, and you'll quickly come to despise your teammates. Also Faction Play has a population problem but that might be TZ-dependent.However, if you're not obsessive about lore, you're okay with running suboptimal builds (Yes balance is an issue but it's not game breaking and if you think it is my Vindis would like a word), and really just wanna blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up with big ol' robots?

												Mechwarrior Online came with great promises and expectations in 2012, hoping to revive the abandoned genre of Battletech, which was one of the most influential genres back in the 90's. There hasn't been a real Mechwarrior PC game since year 2000, so when the MW:O was announced, hype was real and genuine. The developers of Mechwarrior Online, PGI, stated that MW:O is going to be a credible representation of the rich Battletech universe, with tactical combat, simulator experience of piloting a battlemech, including a large, community driven territory expansion and character development ecosystem, combined with real-time lore timeline progression. PGI called their game “thinking man's shooter”, due to how deep the battlemech customization, information warfare and combat roles are compared to any other arena shooters in the market. They weren't entirely wrong, but MWO left a lot of things to be desired. Game has been available for 3 years, however many of the promised features are not in the game, will never be implemented, or are bare bone functional. MWO offers  two game modes, available to any player. First mode, called “Quick Play”, is an arena game team deathmatch mode, where a matchmaker puts you on a random map of 13, with random people within your skill pool. There is nothing particularly worth mentioning, it is a Team Deathmatch of 12 players per team with no respawns. A quick, straightforward game mode, with high ingame currency and experience gain ratio. It is a recommended game mode for new players, until they grasp the basics of the game, then maybe join a clan and select their faction.Second game mode is called “Faction Play”, previously known as Community Warfare. This is an advanced game mode, meant for intermediate players. You can play it as a novice, but you will be severely handicapped by doing that. FP/CW is a team deathmatch with objectives, where a team has to defend or destroy a mission objectives on the map to win the match. It is a slightly deeper in regards to tactics and drop preparation, since you can take up to 4 battlemechs in a match, however it is more time consuming and less currency friendly than Quick Play. This is meant to be the main game mode, but is currently in BETA 2, which is a PGI term for not complete. It should receive a  significant updates in the future, but is severely lacking currently.Mechwarrior Online is a game that is really unique in this genre. It is the only mech combat simulator on the market, and the feeling of piloting a giant combat machine is really outstanding. This is the thing PGI got right. Unfortunately not many other things are on the same level. Once you make through very basic new player experience, you will have a limited amount of really good experience exploring new maps, battlemechs and different strategies, but once the dust settles, MWO is only a mediocre team deathmatch arena shooter with mechs, played on a seriously flawed maps, lacking the promised combat roles and information warfare. Severely lackluster game modes, combined with slow content release cycle and non-evolving balance due negligence of developers leaves little hope for the future of the game.  "

												Great game! been playin since early beta 2011. Im a causal player who only plays a 1-2hrs a day tops, maybe more on the weekends/days off from work. In total ive only spent 160$ on the game over the last few yrs, 55 for a ""a al crate"" MadCat, another 55 for the Mauler that came out not to long ago.. and the rest on MC for PremTime, mechbays, Xp-to-Gxp conversions sales and 2 hero mech when they were 50% off. The Only thing you NEED to BUY in this game is MechBays and they are pertty cheap.. I have 41 mechbays maybe 10 were paid for.. the others were won from weekend events/CW rankings. I own 36 mechs, 8 were paid for with real money (Mauler 55$ = 3mechs, Madcat 55$ = 3mech, and 2Hero mechs) the reast are all earned with cbills. Yes it takes some time to build up cbills to buy mechs.. but plz keep in mind this isnt Pokemon you dont not need to get them all. Find a mech or weight class you enjoy and focus on that. WARNING: MWO is not a P2W game, more like pay-2-get-ahead... as in you dont have to play a bunch of games to earn cbills to buy mechs u can just use real money to get them.. buyin mechs for realy $$ will not give you a advantage. If you do feel the need to throw money at the game buy a hero mech when they are on sale, they provide a 30% cbill boost to your end match earnings when playing that mech. But i would really sugest that you play for atleast a month befor you do, this should give you enought time to play the trial mechs maybe buy 1-2mechs for cbills, and get an idea of what mech/weight class you enjoy the most.Hope this review is help full.. if you have any questions i highly suggest goin to the NewPlayer section of the forums on the MWO website to get real answers.

IntroductionI started this game 100% fresh to MechWarrior and BattleTech in general and am loving every minute of it. I don't feel as though it's pay to win, I'm no stranger to tactical shooters so maybe that helps. After my first 25 Cadet games I had ~20 mill C-bills which seemed to be enough to get either a few IS mechs or a single clan mech and completely kit them out with a custom loadout. Which may not seem like alot, considering the vast variety of mech choices there are, but for the most part it's a solid starting point.Free to Play modelI will argue that c-bill gain without premium time after those 25 cadet games can be very slow, but just like any similar game to this (World of Tanks, War Thunder, etc) it's just a grind, and for the most part the mechs are fairly well balanced at the moment. Some mechs are argueably just flat out worse than others, but if you learn the game mechanics and play properly any mech can work in the right pilots hands. So far I've spent very little money on this game and I have played it for a solid 2-4 hours minimum per day since I downloaded it and it's still a blast. I personally do not consider this game to be pay2win by any means.CommunitySo far I have had very little problems with the community, the occasional salty teammate in chat, but what game doesn't have that. Not alot of people use the in game VOIP which is relatively disappointing considering the game revolves aren't alot of focus firing and communication, but it hasn't seemed to dictate the overall results of my matches (though the matches go much smoother when communication is present). There is tons of useful information for new and verteran players alike on the forums, pretty much anything I've wanted to learn about the game has been readily available via a simple google search.Gameplay MechanicsBeing new to MechWarrior the gameplay mechanics at first were a little overwhelming but even the most average of gamers can readily grasp how to play the game and even more advanced mechanics like shielding and such. The introduction tutorial isn't anything incredible but it does give a fairly solid overview of the basics of the game such as targetting components, firegroups, and mech movement. For a little fun shoot the captain a few times after you finish the intial tutorial and are at the MechWarrior Academy.Overall VerditI would 100% recommend this game to anyone who enjoys shooters in general, especially tactical team based shooters such as Arma or most Tom Clancy games. Team play is pretty key to success, very rarely does a lone wolf accomplish much in a match of MechWarrior, but even when your team doesn't communicate via chat or VOIP as long as you pay attention and try to focus targets down with your teammates the game doesn't feel like a complete landslide.As for a number rating for those who enjoy those silly things, I would say somewhere around 8/10, definitely a game you can get very involved in and play every single day for extended sessions, or even the type of game you can just hop on for a couple matches every once in a while.

												The game is good for what it is. As it is, and not what it could have been.Because if you delve in what ""it could have been"" then no game is good ever. Allow me to say this: MWO is a ♥♥♥♥♥on of half released promises and a development with a snail pace, seemingly incompetent devs and really questionable design decisions that have made this game get the bad rep it has. And still the game is addictive and fun. It just is. The fact that so many want to moan around the game is because we're all in the stockholm syndrome. When you're hunting down another mech and land that AC20 and see the explosion from afar is priceless. The one man last stand win or the one last MPulse Laser knife fight makes it worth it. As an arena mech shooter it works, and it's fun, and if you like robot ""simulation"" adn multiplayer this is as close as you will get for the decade. Alex Iglesias art is beautiful and the Battletech redesigns are really good.I'm not defending PGI's past ♥♥♥♥ups, or the future ♥♥♥♥ ups, or the fact that this is going to be a slow year AGAIN with patches and content, but the game itself and what they have done right is a game that is fun at its core. Sometimes anger inducing, sometimes pure adrenaline fun.So if you plan to play this game just download it and test it for yourself. Don't let the golds and the jaded super fanboys tell you it's a straight bad game because it would be a lie. But as for their salt and hate, they wouldn't be wrong either in many points.			"

												TLDR: MWO is a solid Mech combat game that suffers from an Apathetic, minimum viable product developers. It doesn't have the depth of many previous Mechwarrior/Battletech titles but can deliver a decent mech simulator experience with up-to-date graphics for those wanting.It's hard to find a game as polarizing as MWO. Some love it, some hate it, but both sides have their points. The game is far from new, at the time of this review its a little over 2 years old and just hitting steam now. It launched in 2013 to middling reviews, many can agree the core gameplay is solid. But on launch it only had two gamemodes, and in the two years since they claim to have added 3 more. Though one is Skirmish (Deathmatch) which added nothing new gameplay wise, and Invasion/Invasion Counter Attack (Same mode mirrored). A vast majority of games will come down to destroying the enemy team, and to do so you have a very wide selection of mechs and loadouts. The meta of which has been evolving over the life of the game. As a Legendary Founder who has played on and off since beta I've seen the rise and fall of OP Alpha-strikes, LRMgeddon, Poptarting, etc. Currently the game revolves around mid-short range brawls, generally playing peakaboo at the line of skirmish until one side finds an edge and pushes through to vitctory. Games tend to play out a little one sided. At the core of many arguments is the pricing model of MWO. At launch they offered tiered packs with exclusive mech variants to raise support for the game. While many accepted it as a good way to kickstart the games development, few suspected it would carry on as a common occurance. In 26 months there have been 5 more drives for money including Resistance I and II, and Clan invasion 1, 2, and 3. Not counting pre-order exclusivity to new Mechs for cash only. These typically offer a range of mechs from Light all the way up to Assault in increasingly expensive packs. A common criticism is the option to buy mechs 'a la carte' being much more expensive without offering many of the benefits of the pack. Making heavier mechs arbitrarily cost more as you will either have to pay the fee or suck it up and buy the rest of the lighter mechs bundled together. Another criticism is the exclusive variants of mechs marketed as ""heroes"" for cash only. While they are generally considered on par if not worse than ones available for in-game currency. Many find it distastful to lock potentially gameplay and balance effecting loadouts behind a paywall. In recent months they've began running tournaments which make it possible to earn their premium currency and time without spending money. But you'll be grinding for a long time to catch up on all the mechs they've released since. MWO is not a pay to win game, but its definitely pay to skip the grind. It can be unfriendly to new players with a steep learning curve (Tutorial has helped somewhat), uncooperative community, and combination of unfriendly game mechanics. To master a mech you will need to own three variants of it, which means you will need to do your research if you don't want to waste your initial cadet bonus C-bills on a mech that you'll abandon down the road. It will also take a fair amount of games in each chassis to reach your maximum potential. Even just maxing out your favorite mech of each weight class will be a large undertaking without shelling out money for a mech with Cbill or Exp boosts and premium time. While not mandatory, it is a competitive PvP game and you're going to want every advantage you can get. The developers objectively haven't handled the game very well, they are typically slow to react to the players or occasional controversy such as the backlash surrounding the infamous $500 golden mechs. Their actions, or in-action has lead to the current climate in the community where it seems to be a 50/50 split between die-hard supporters of the franchise who love the game for what it is, and those that are upset with the direction the game has taken and that it doesn't stay true to previous incarnations of the series. At least within the vocal minority, many have silently left or continued to enjoy the game. Which if you intend on playing is my recommended course of action, avoid the forums/subreddits/discussions unless you want to see the toxicity first hand.			"

												WOO HOO! 1000 HOURS OF LEGIT GAMEPLAY! that should tell you how addicted i am xDWow, Im supprised at these reviews for MWO though, ""most toxic community i have ever been in""? far from it, most players are loyal mature people in their 30 - 60's, and have been playing since the boardgame.the game truely is however, punishing on newer players, for a good month of play people wont be proficiant enough to help their team win matches, and cbills(money) comes gradually, so mechs take some time to aquire in addition to having only 4 mechbays at the start of the game.theres so many choices and options and for builds, that i had some people shut down on me and quit, just because they dident know what to do, RELAX, this is normal, take a deep breath and consult any of the number of players you meet. someone will be happy to help you with a good build. it's not hard at all and it should be quite self explanitory once you get used to it.there are weekly events for more mechbays and good chunks of premium money, enough so that one wouldent have to spend money to get far in the game, once you get up there though, things are super smooth sailing.heres to hoping the faction play rework will be any good, and theres some hope for them remaking the skill trees soon as well,Edit 12/27/2016: 1200h's aw yis.

												Game can be fun, and how to keep it fun, is DO NOT buy any mech packs. Just use in game C-bills to buy your mechs. You will get them fom playing.  If you buy mechs, you will start to hate the game, because PGI like to swing the NERF bat.  So just play have fun, and don't spend real Money ont his game.  You can get Mech bays from doing CW, just take a 2 week contract and rank it up a couple lvls then move to next faction. MC you can also get from CW and weekly events. With the MC you can buy mech bays, or save up for hero mechs. (they are not worth it other then the 30% c-bill boost) Most all the free mechs are better than Heros. So play the game, have fun... and don't spend real money on anything. Plus the stuff is way over priced, you can buy new games for the price of a mech pack.  It suxs when you buy a mech and then it gets nurfed.  They say it is for balance, and I give them that, but Clan tech should be better then IS tech, not even. if they want even for the e-sport they want to turn this game into, then advance the time line when IS and Clan tack are even. I will keep playing MWO, because it can be fun, but I do have a bitter tastes in my mouth from spending real cash on NERF bait. Just trying to save you the bitter taste. Take it from a long time player.  See you on the field, Happy hunting. Zom			"

												I probably have close to a thousand hours in-game with Mechwarrior Online and have certainly had some great times across its lifecycle, but I would not recommend putting a single cent into the game.MWO should serve as a warning to what can happen with a crowdfunded/early access title when incompetence and greed align. The game's original publisher (IGP) was created specifically to organise parts of MWO's development, yet for years it bled the developer (PGI) of incoming funds and directed them towards other, failing, projects. Actual work on the game would pretty much cease for months at a time, or end up focused on features that would increase IGP's revenue without improving the experience.Eventually the developer and publisher parted ways and just enough change occurred to make you hopeful. But through years of genuine criticism PGI's leadership team has hardened against any kind of feedback, resulting in increasingly slapdash decision making and implementation alongside very public hostility towards parts of the community.At this point the playerbase has declined precipitously and the free-to-play 'whales' have been bled dry. A complete redesign of one of the core pillars of the game has sat announced for almost a year, with very limited testing and no word on what the final decision will be. Not a positive thing in a game that exchanges real cash for in-game effectiveness.A palpable sense of desperation lurks in almost every aspect of Mechwarrior Online's experience, in the UI, in the gameplay changes, in the pricing structure and in the organised events. By all means check it out, a solid Mechwarrior title lurks beneath, but make no mistake MWO is dying. It's reached the point all free-to-play products risk hitting, more ponzi scheme than workable game.			"

												If someone tells you this game is bad, they're bad, their mech is bad, and they should feel bad for talking this way about the game.  The epitome of team work and balance, a tactical game where knowing key map points and the weaknesses of mechs is impertive, if you're looking for a game that's immersive and balanced almost to the point of stupidity, this game is for you.  Work with your team mates, communicate well and call your targets, you'll have good games.Pros:- Extremely balanced.  Because all mechs in their respective factions pick from the same pool of weapons, you can't blame something for being overpowered unless you're just approaching it from the wrong angle of attack.  Everything has a weakness from not being able to aim at certain angles, to being slow, to being a large target, to being extremely squishy in certain areas, to not being able to turn fast.  Over time you learn what mechs can and can't do well, and you can exploit this.- Huge variety for customization to suit every play style from people that like tanks and huge damage to people that like stealth and fast jabs at enemies.- Lots of mechs to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.Cons:- Huge learning curve.  Your first 10 or so games you will do less than 100 damage, perhaps a bit over 100 if you're in an assualt, and after 50+ games you'll be happy if you get 400 damage.  A damage amount for a skilled player is anywhere from 500-1000, and over 1000 for long games.- Sometimes you get matched up with people that don't communicate.- Poor optimization.  I've got SLI 1080 ti with a 6700k OC to 4.8 and in some moments I drop down to 40 fps.  Turn down settings if you have issues.			"

												Full disclosure, I'm a founder that's been playing since closed beta.Even if you ignore all the controversey including PGI selling a bill of goods and then pulling a bait & switch, most of which is detailed in this article http://www.gamefront.com/mechwarrior-online-forum-ragesplosion/ -addition of real money consumeables(buying power)-addition of 3rd Person View allowing players to peek over ridges-addition of ghost heat limiting viable builds that are already limited by a chassis weight class, number of critical slots, number of hardpoints and their locations to discourage laser/PPC boating due totheir pinpoint accuracy. Resulting in players being cored within seconds of a match. This resulted in lasers and PPC's being suboptimal as they were never buffed after the devs limited how many could be viably equipped relegating them to supplementary weapons because of high heat output, delay between shots on standard lasers or reduced range on pulse lasers.it doesn't change that the game itself isn't for casual Battletech fans. Especially with mech pack pre-orders in the hundreds of dollars that are withheld as timed exclusives until an arbitrary date after they are released. 'Whales' are willing to pay which is why the pricing structure hasn't changed since the beta.Virtually everything in the game besides non-hero mechs carry a premium real money price in the form of MC(MechCredits), including literally paint, none of which can be unlocked over time via the in-game currency you accumulate through normal play(c-bills).One of the biggest problems is the mechbay gating system. Each mech you own artbitrarily requires an available corresponding mechbay. If you have 10 mechbays and 10 mechs, you cannot unlock an additional mech until you either sell at a loss that you've already spent time leveling up, or you purchase an additional mechbay which can also only be purchased with MC. Effectively, you will always be spending money on the game. It fails as an F2P title because you cannot unlock using time as a currency by simply grinding out enough in-game currency through nomral play.TL:DRBottomline, I love Mechwarrior, I've been a fan since the 90's. Even in MWO I love tweaking the mechs, the combat is fun even with the flaws and I like being able setup various weapon groups to control which weapons fire independently of others. It's been proposed in the past that they offer a VIP system where once you've spent a combined minimum total on the game, you would unlock VIP status that would remove the Mechbay system and give you a permanent XP/C-bill bonus and maybe even a permanent 10-15% discount on premium items that would stack with sales promotions, if not also unlock the all the paints. I would gladly spend another $50 or $60 on the game if it granted those benefits. Sadly, however, I cannot recommend the game in its current incarnation. Hopefully we will eventually get a proper Mechwarrior 5.			"

												tl;dr it's fun to play, and it's a good team gameprotip if your just starting: give every weight class a shot, they play so fundamentally differentI played this a bit in beta when it was still just lance vs lance (squad v squad) battles, not that great, so I figured I'd let it run and run and if it was still around in a few years strong I'd give it a shot. Now that they've made their release on steam I figured it'd be a good time to jump in finally.I haven't had this much fun in awhile. I've been digging in and I love the gameplay of this game. I hear bad things about the development overtime, bad decisions that have been made. The interface is lackluster. There's terrible community implimentation. You can't even view a 'recent played with' list to find new friends.All that being said, this game has depth and it's fun.			"

Help, is just a Google search away.And, if you're lucky, you'll make a group of friends that you'll be playing together with often.

(It's worth it.)+fun alone but more fun with friends+can have fun without paying money or grinding excessively+there are events every 2-4 months where you can earn premium cash (MC)+has a faction/community-warfare mode where you battle over star systems in a permanent map+/- I heard the guys over at support are pretty nice.-probably gonna be infested by Russians in a year's time-no Linux client			"

Product received for free
												Mechwarrior online is a Free to play shooter where you pilot mechs from the battletech universe against other players, this game has a few features i really like and i felt the need to voice my own oppionons about this game, so let's begin.#1 this game is free with in-game premium content. Now i know what you're thinking ""OMG P2W BLEEEEEEH"" i promise you it's nothing like the ""World Of"" games. The mechs you can access with only premium money are no more or less powerful than any other mech in the game. The only diffrence is a 30% boost to your chasis EXP and C-bills gained from gameplay, and of course a unique paintjob. You CAN buy only a limited amount of mechs before you start needing to buy mechbays, but even these go on sale and are usually only about $2.50 a pop usually. But once again, this game is free.#2 This game is easy to learn and hard to master. When you boot up the game you get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of information thrown at you unless you play the tutorial, which is about 15 minutes long and explains everything you need to know about the basics of gameplay. BUT there are many high-level tactics such as twisting and jump-jet fluttering you'll need to learn about before you get to tier 1 or 2 play.#3 This isn't call of duty! This game is a bit slower paced and about tactics and position. Teamwork will make or break you almost 100% of the time, don't expect to get many kills early on, it takes about 25 games before you start getting one or two kills.#4 Trail mechs. My god do i love the devs for this. Every week or so the free mechs switch, and you never have to buy them, thinking about buying a timberwolf but you're not sure you want to spend 15,000,000 c-bills? play the trail version a few times and see if the mech suits your playstyle.#5 This game is beutiful, the sound effects, maps, visuals, and mech designs are stunning and you really feel as if you're piloting a 30+ ton war machine. Plus the faction warfare map is awsome to zoom in on and look at all the diffrent planets. The battletech universe is incredibly lore-heavy and the game reflects that.alltogether i give this game 9/10. the gameplay is amazing, as are the sound effects, but without a group of friends you won't have a whole lot of fun with the grinding.now a few tips for new players:your first 25 games you will get a ""account injection: cadet bonus"" this will give you a bunch of c-bills, you'' feel rich and want to buy a mech but take it from me: wait until you know what you're getting into! Outfittting a chassis takes A LOT of in-game cash and can eat your money up if you spend recklessly.find yourself a mic and a player who knows a thing or two about this game, listen to what they have to say and you'll start crushing in public games! Dont feel discouraged if you die without getting kills, damage is where new players need to focus, support your team and stay with the group. You can't take on 2 or 3 enemies by yourself!			"

This in my opinion is the best free to play game I have ever played. You can play solo or with friends, or do both (Sometimes do random sink drops for fun). Lets point form it.Pro's ; Great Future Feel of being in a big stompy robot and working with a team to win the match's.        ; IT'S FREE TO PLAY (Even a non leveled trial mech, can mess up any mech in the right situation)        ; You can solo play, join factions, do community warfare, and more to come.        ; MECH LAB - This is the heart or the core of mech warrior, if you like simple to complex puzzles, engines, lasers, and more then this is the game for you. The build of your mech is up to you.         ; Did I mention BIG SToMPY ROBOTS, Warhorn's, decals, cockpit items and big friendly stompy playersCon's ; Steep learning curve, got to give it a couple of week's to months of casual play to really get into game (But can understand the basics within an hour or so)          ; No animation for legs being blown off          ; No waa waa waaaaa sound when you use a key to open a supple case and only get a narc (Or some basic item)          ; No Warhorn available with the sound ""MINE<MINE< MINE<MINE""          ; No melay or knocking over mech'sEvery month they update and try different events for players to win new item's, mech's and more.

												I wanted this game to be great and amazing, but it has become rotten egg...Keeping this review really brief...because writing any more about this review is a waste of time.  Game really doesn't have much depth or multi-layered depth.  An example of a game that has multi-layered depth (combines different gameplay/game-mechanical features) is warframe.Positives..+Has a good UI for customizing mechs+Graphics for mechs and Cockpit are done well+Game runs wellNegatives-Developer doesn't seem to know what to do with MWO.  They changed Faction play into quickplay mapsmodes, some of which are horribly designed to work for Faction play-No Salvage system like in other mechwarrior games-No AI, except for static targets-Game favors rewards based on kills/damage dealt, versus completing missions.  I thought mechwarriors was suppose to be more than this?-mission payouts are too low-very repetative gameplayIn relation to the comments for further reading, more indepth reasoning for the negatives...Salvage has been in nearly every mechwarrior game in some fashion.  Winning a battle and being able to salvage a mech or being able to salvage parts for a mech could have great feature added to the game.  It might have been outside the scope of the intial developement, but you do get salvage credits at the end of every match.  They could be instead be used for further depth into MWOAI added to the game let the developers add the escort mission into the game.  Imagine if they could do far with AI to bring a sense of immersion into the game using a lot of the battletech units.  Tanks fighting along side us mechwarriors as a simple example.The negatives mentioned above in ""negatives"" list could have great impact on what MWO could become, but like stated ealier the developers seem do not know what to do with their IP.  I am glad the timeline has been moved forward though, but then again some of the battlemechs added are in the wrong timeline.. (so does the timeline really matter?).			"

												After logging in about 120 hours in a little under 2 weeks, I think I can safely say I am addicted to this game.Being a long-time fan of BattleTech and MechWarior games in the past, I was very excited when I found out about this game a few years back. I tried it then, but it failed to catch my interest. I think this was mostly due to the lack of classic mechs from those earlier games, mechs like the: Marauder, Archer, Crusader, Phoenix Hawk, Locust, Wasp, Stinger, Rifleman, and WarHammer.Here we are a few years later and I decide to give it another chance when I see it become available on Steam. The game play is fun and the graphics are really good. There are strategic and tactical elements to the game. There are advancements for both the pilot and the mechs. Between the large variety of chassis and the numerous variations of each chassis, plus the ability to customize your builds and looks, there are a huge number of options available.The one major thing that this game has done to capture my interest this time around is to include classic mechs from the early days of BattleTech. The Locust and Marauder are already in the game. The WarHammer, Rifleman and Archer are all on the release schedule with confirmed delivery dates. I still hope to see other classics like the Phoenix Hawk, Crusader, Wasp and Stinger eventually, but at least they now have some of the most important classic mechs available in the game.There is a lot to grind in this game, but that is a good thing. It means you will have plenty of work to keep you motivated for the long haul. You have the option to grind any mech you want in whatever order you want. Nothing is time-gated or level-gated. If you want to pilot an Assault mech from the start you have that option without having to work your way through Light, Medium and Heavy mechs first. The boosters and bonuses you receive during your first 25 missions are more than enough to help any new player get into whatever mech they are interested in. The company also seems to do a lot of promotions offering free in-game currency and gear. I come from War Thunder, where it took me over a year of playing to unlock top tier aircraft and max out aircrews in just one of five countries. The grind in this game seems like nothing compared to that. At least with MWO you have access to everything right from the beginning.MWO is a free to play game, but like with other such games, they do need a source of revenue. They earn this by selling early access to new content, cosmetic options, subscription time, etc. None of that is mandatory. The early access to new content is for things like new mechs, which everybody gets access to eventually anyways. The cosmetic options are nice to have, but are completely optional, and they let you earn some options during events. The subscription options are actually very beneficial if you are at all bothered by ""The Grind"", and give you a +50% bonus to XP and C-Bills. If you don't mind grinding content like me then you can just enjoy the journey and feel good when you complete your goals on your own merit.In addition to your normal quick-play modes of Capture, Assault and Skirmish on numerous unique maps, there is a more advanced mode called Community Warfare. This is the mode for experienced players that have built up a collection of fully loaded mechs, understand tactics and strategy, and work together in teams. This mode is about capturing and defending planets while fulfilling contracts for the Houses of the Inner Sphere or the invading Clans. The stakes are much greater, but so too are the rewards. It will be quite a while before I am capable of participating in Community Warfare, but this seems like a excellent mode for extending a player's interest in the game. I look forward to getting involved in this mode.I am very happy with the progress I have seen in this game since I first tried it a few years ago. It is much improved, and definitely worth playing for anybody interested in mech combat or fans of BattleTech.			"

												So many mechs!My background:  I haven't played tabletop, nor a huge Battletech fan.  I have played previous titles.  I don't normally play Shooters.  That said, here is an honest review...PROS:*Maps look great (graphics tend to the more ""real"" feel)*Good tutorial (Mechwarrior Academy)*Can run around solo on the multiplayer maps in Trainings Grounds*Almost unlimited configuations (once you can afford to buy mechs)*Earning in-game currency is easy at first*Mechs look amazing and there are plenty*Lots of weapons to choose from*Map voting*VOIP*Slower, more time to think than a Shooter*Simulation feel of being in the cockpit of a giant mech (has both 1st and 3rd Person available views)*Community Warfare shows initial signs of being a cornerstone of the Great Houses/Clans conflict*Matchmaker seems to generally do ok pairing players together*Excellent sound effects for weapons*3 Quick Play game modes plus Faction PlayCONS:*Navigating the UI can be a challenge.*Steep learning curve (previous titles in the franchise were just as difficult)*Only trial mechs to start out with*No tutorial on how to build a decent mech*Game mechanics seem complicated*No respawn (although limited in Faction Play)*No matchmaking in Faction Play*Game modes seem similar*Minimal destrucible environmentGRAPHICS: 8/10 (tend toward realism, uses CryEngine)GAMEPLAY: 7.5/10 (mainly Deathmatch/Destruction, with an occasional base cap)MUSIC/SOUND: 8.5/10 (Music decent, sound effects awesome, no music during matches)UI: 6.5/10 (it's pretty, but overly complicated)MAPS: 7.5/10 (13? distinct maps.  They recently reworked 3 that come with some destructible terrain, dropship, and time of day changes)MECHLAB: 7/10 (Building a mech itself is as deep as any previous title, but no tutorial and overly complicated at first)COMMUNITY: 7/10 (Most are friendly, some very sour apples...forums at http://mwomercs.com/forums/REPLAY VALUE: 8/10 (Enough maps, mechs, weapons, and game modes to replay, but can get repetitive.  At that point might be a good time to switch over to Faction Play)PRICE: 9/10.  It is totally F2P. Biggest complaint I've heard is that there are mechs P2W.  Not true.  Can buy any mech except Hero mechs with in-game currency.  Only about 10% of the mechs are Hero and do have different hardpoints, but they are rarely seen on the battlefield because they are not any better than others in the associated chassis.  They do receive a 30% Cbill boost which is why pilots buy them - to earn cash and not to dominate the battlefield.  If you are going to buy a mech I would suggest looking at the in-game store first.  A $14.95 MC package can get you 2 Medium mechs (Cicadas), or it could get you 4 Light mechs (2 Commandos, 2 Locusts).  Obviously Heavies and Assaults are more expensive.TLDR:  8.5/10.  Game is a blast, needs work, but bi-monthly patches introduce regular new content and fixes.

												This is a great game (if you want something different than any other FPS right now)(1000 hours on this game pre-steam release)MWO is a strange thing for sure. Will you like it? Well it really depends on what you expect from a FPS.In here, you will not run like a headless chicken (except if you drive Locusts), you will not instantly kill your opponent with a lucky (or skilled) headshot, you will not respawn, you will not magically heal the damages you took during the fight.You will take care of your team mates, you will run for cover under heavy missiles fire, you will sacrifice part of your Mech just to shield your engine while charging, and you will unleash the power of 20 tons of weapons (or more) against giant walking tanks.Pros:- Mech building: before you fight, you have to build your Mech. You choose its weapons, its engine, how much armor it has for each part, how much ammunitions, electronics... The Mechlab is a place where you are gonna spend a lot of time, as it determines a  lot of what you will be able to do in a game, but you'll spend Good time on it. - Simulation feelings: you are in a huge machine of death, but not a fast Japanese Meka. You're heavy, slow, and the controls feel that way. You have to plan your movements because you can't turn back in the blink of an eye if enemies show up. Then again, you are just driving some kind of a giant tank with arms and legs, so it's not that hard to master.- Unique combat style: in MWO, you can shoot with lots of weapons, on the same Mech, all at once... The only thing restraining you from non stop fire is the heat your weapons generate when fired. You have to manage this heat so you don't shutdown from overheating (which means standing still while your Mech cools off - a bad thing). You also have one life per drop, and no healing. Your Mech will lose some parts during a game, and learning how to spread damages as the fight goes on is a key component of being good at MWO.- Beautifull visuals: the Mechs are amazing, all of them. Of course, you will love some and hate some, but the redesign are all incredible. Why ""re""design? Because next point:- A 30 years old universe: yup it's an old license, with lots of famous heros, feared mercenary organisations, long stories for every factions and clans.- Continuous development: there is a full team of developers on this game and you can see it. 2 updates per month since  3 years is pretty awesome, as the game is still evolving and switching towards a great balance (which has its Cons).- Giant robots!: we all love them, you know it, and there's currently undreds of mechs to choose from.- Trully Free-to-Play: All the game is available for free. You can't buy with real money better gear or Mechs. There are Hero Mechs you can't buy with the in-game curency, but they are far from being even ""top"" (some even far from being good - but that's another story).Cons:- Very steep learning curve: This game is hard. It really is. Movement, damage, heat, weapon firing, Mech building, all need a lot of time to be mastered, and you have to re-learn some of those each time you buy a new chassis.- It's not CoD: as said before, this is a slow paced game where you need to think. You need patience, teamwork and strategy to avoid getting wrecked.- Balance??: MWO comes from a 30y old franchise, ok, but that license has its flaws. Rules from the TableTop games were broken because they were not meant for a real-time FPS, and the MWO team does his best to rebalance everything while not going to much away from the original material, but there is still room for improvements (still, there aren't real ""cheezy"" Mechs or weapons, just some that are a bit better and some that are useless).In the end, the game is really enjoyable if you want a tough game that has nothing to do with any other game on the market so far. The feelings from moving from a cover to another under enemy fire while twisting your torso to spread damage all over your Mech, running and harassing while in a Light Mech- knowing you will die if you get hit-, or being a tower of destruction in an Assault Mech... In MWO, you feel like fighting, and the fight is a 12vs12 brawl. With missiles. And giant lasers.You don't need money so give it a try. Maybe you'll stay (I know i did, since 2012).			"

												Definitely not without flaw, but still a very fun game to play with friends and teammates.The community overall is one of the best I have ever experienced from any prior game. Much more mature players than an average shooter. There are the occasional bad eggs, but for the most part those people are not embraced by the community as a whole.Lots of units to choose from with varying skill levels or focuses. There are various recruitment threads on www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG as well as the hiring hall and recruitment forums on mwomercs.comPGI has been doing a lot better lately making positive changes and working with the community to make the game better. It is difficult the please everybody and they have made quite a few bad balancing decisions in the past, but it seems like they are starting to get more in line with what needs to be done.Some of the new maps have been focusing more on being pretty and large instead of functional and balanced. The fact that they redid the maps in the first place was a step in the right direction, but I feel like at the time they could have gathered more info from the community as to what needed to be done to make the maps better. They listened to the part where people wanted destructable trees and stuff, but then took it a step further and put so much of it in that it obscures vision. Also the fog needs to GO. Poor visibility does not make things enjoyable. We'll see if the next map the do fixes some of those issues.The 3rd party competitive scene is solid, and is only getting better as the community grows. PGI has been paying attention to 3rd party leagues and have been supporting them with prizes and coverage. They even had a team made up of their developers in the most recent season of MRBC!Come play with us!There is a handy player made starter guide here:https://www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG/comments/3w6ll1/welcome_to_mechwarrior_online_resources_and_faq/Edit: still playing religiously			"

												Well, I didn't even use Steam to play the game so far, apart from just logging in to compare, and I'll just play without Steam, so, the play-time is very likely to remain... low =]I've played MWO couple of years ago, when there were only Inner Sphere mechs, and not a lot of them, no Community Warfare, and mechanics were very different. Got bored after a week and gave it up.I've came back 4 months ago, following friends' interest in the game, and this time instead of joining random battles and getting tired of the game, I've read some guides, push-farmed my first Community Warfare drop-deck (4 mechs), joined a big and active unit, and still having a blast so far; making new friends, having fun, actually enjoying the game.So, is the game good / interesting / worth a try? Yes.Is it a "" Battletech lore masterpiece""? Not even close. It's a MMO, based off Battletech universe, with everything that comes with those two things. There is a very strong and active community of players, but also a very steep learning curve, with ""veteran players"" not pulling any punches. And to boot it up - a lot of the active players also very critical of the game, despite playing it. And there are a LOT of bitterness from former players as well.So, both a pro and a con. Developers did introduce various mechanics to ease it up for new players, by making separate match-making ques for solo-players and for groups, and also according to their ""mastery rank"", which adjusts accordingly with one's experience and how well they play as well.The game is constantly updated, with various changes, not too fast to become a blur of constant instability, but fast enough not to get too stagnated and boring... in theory. New content, and especially events - every week or two. On the other hand - most of the new content just cosmetics: new mechs, sometimes redone maps etc. Mechs just recently got re-balanced, and not for the first time, but a lot of people feel, that changes could be far more substantial.The map for the Community Warfare (territorial wars) was reset recently, opening new possibilities etc - but no actual changes to mechanics of the wars there. Which make quite a lot of people sad...Would I recommend people to try it? Yes... but: After trying it out, finishing the tutorial and getting some games in various trial-mechs behind your belt and pocketing all the newbie-freebies - read manuals, get some non-trial mechs (remember, that your own mechs you can refit - and for Inner Sphere, green by default, you can change the engines and what kind of armor and structure to use, and for Clan, gray by default, you can change arms/shoulders/legs, to get different weapon-slots and bonuses), learn to play in those, and then look for a unit. The game is fun when you're with a unit, and not fun at all when solo.Then the learning curve won't be as brutal. And then you'd be able to judge the game for what it is and if you personally enjoy the game, and not feel frustrated at the starting learning curve and judge the curve instead of the game.Unlike some other ""match-games where one team of armored vehicles fight another team"", where they lure you in with easy and fast progression at ""low-tiers"", and then stomp some huge grind on top of ya on later ""tiers"", MWO doesn't have vehicle tiers or levels. Mechs differ in classes, but anyone can get any mech they wish at any point. The prices don't change either (it'll cost exactly the same for a newbie as for a veteran). So, they bite when you just start playing, and they are easy when you've been playing for a while.New players get it rather hard, because despite the huge tutorial and first-games pays off - it's barely enough to get you some mechs, depending on what you went for and without reading guides - one can easily spoil everything for oneself. On the other hand, once you did that first proper drop-deck to go join Community Warfare (I'd recommend mix of mediums and heavies to begin with - lights, despite being extremely fun, require fast reaction and some knowledge of tactics and maps to be good, and assaults... are very situational, despite being brutal in right hands), and manage to find yourself in a team, that accepts new players but also do organized drops that win games - getting new mechs isn't hard. After a while (after 5 weeks of playing in my case) an evening or two worth of playing would get you a heavy mech. That's when getting mech-bays (slots) will become more important, than getting money to buy those mechs =]P.S. yes, you can play it for free, without paying. Resisting the urge to ""boost it up just a bit"" may be hard, if you can pay, but if you cannot or just have a strong will combined with patience - it's very playable without any cash put into the game. Especially since often enough various ""extras"", including premium time, are parts of prizes for various challenges in events, that happen every week or two.			"

												I thought it might be some pay-to-win nightmare wearing the skin of a legend, but thankfully it isn't. Paying for *anything*, or not paying for anything, won't make any difference to your capacity to win (or lose) at this game. You don't even need to buy things with the in-game C-Bills you accumulate for simple match participation, as a rotation of community-designed mechs of all classes is available for free play anytime!You can even win the normally paid-for currency in events; I've been playing this for one week, and in this time an event has been launched which will last for 10 days where you can win all kinds of unique or normally paid-for stuff.Well done Piranha, well done.Now if you can only integrate the Steam market so people could trade bits of kit, mechs, camo's, etc. this might be the only game I'd ever play.

												After putting a fair time into attempting to play this game, I have to say this game is too unforgiving for new players that want to learn to play the game today.  New players will find themselves in matches that have been playing for some time.  This results in them having unlocked skills that can take some time to get.  While there is a match making system I can not say this system is effective as I often feel outclassed with games that I actually do ok feeling too infequent.  As a fan of MW2-4 I love Mechwarrior but this game is frustrating to me.  I can imagine it would be worse for those that have no clue when it comes to certain game aspects.MWO is F2P:  I can honestly say that players that pay will not kill you soley because they have paid money.  The money spent allows players to own more mechs, earn resources/exp faster and buy cosmetic items.  I would recommend anyone interested in this game to try before looking to spend money.  If you like the game there are 4 steam packs that allow you to grind faster once you find a class style that you enjoy.There are positive aspects to this game such as the complexity and potential for group tatics but in random matches you may not often find this.  You may lose when you should be pushing forward when other times you should employ other tatics.  Perhaps playing with several friends and work together will help you fare better.			"

												I have played every Mechwarrior game since MW2 and this is the best yet. Obviously the graphics are a huge step up, but Faction Warfare also makes the universe really come alive, especially now that there is a parallel Scouting mode. The Quick Play game modes are also very interesting.Even though this is a free-to-play game, there isn't really a pay-to-win component, and the mech customization is on par with what you would expect from previous MW games. You can really get into details and have a lot of fun with it. And there is a huge range of mechs to choose from which keeps things interesting.There is still work to do: 1) Faction Warfare needs an endgame, i.e. if Clans capture Terra they should win. 2) Add even more modes to Faction Warfare 3) Fix queues in Faction Warfare, the waiting is too long, 4) If a planet is completely captured then a new planet should open up for the attackers, 5) More in-game lore, 6) Better documentation for new players, 7) More mech customization options, especially more weapon types.Those are just my suggestions but on the whole I really, really like this game!

												Installed the game (last time i played was over a year ago.), not much has changed, still the same broken system I left over a year ago. They added more mechs to sell in the cash shop, new skins, new perks etc.After playing 3-4 games I uninstalled one more time. Here is a great article describing my frustration with this game:http://www.destructoid.com/mechwarrior-online-s-community-warfare-has-taught-me-what-it-feels-like-to-be-the-frustrated-parent-285078.phtmlI was so hoping for a great mechwarrior game after many years, I had great expectations from piranha games but after coming back and seeing the same stuff with different skins my hopes are even lower....I would suggest playing world of tanks if you want to blow smthg up if you have 10 minutes of time. One positive side is the community, it has a great community still waiting smthg to happen after 3 years.			"

												Giant Mechs shooting eachother and plenty of cover to make your 20 ton Locust effective at hit-and-run sweeps against a 100 ton Atlas.One match I was deployed in a Locust (smallest mech) and I was up against an Atlas (one of the largest mechs).  We found ourselves facing off as the last two alive.  Effective use of cover and a lot of running happened.  In the end, I took the Atlas down.  The learning curve can be steep but keep in mind it's free to play.  The mechs which require real money to buy aren't any better than other mechs but simply offer unique loadouts and paint schemes.  Additionally, all the pre-order mechs that you can purchase will eventually be available for the free in-game currency.  The camo specs, and paint colors that you have to purchase currency for can typically be picked up during the frequent weekend-based events by participating.  In short, this is a fun game.  Get teamspeak and play with friends.			"

												I have to admit I rage quit this game before it came to Steam, it was over LRMs.I even complained about LRMs in Steam forums.But I thought I would give it another shot. But before I did I research the game more and developed a better idea on how to play.Once I got back into my old account I was given a crap ton of C-Bills and some achievements so that was a good start.I owned 3 Hunchbacks because I like Hunchback and I decided to trick one out with a build I found online.I developed a long term plan and have been sticking with it.I die alot but I got all my Hunchbacks to elite and I am making my way to Master, that was the plan.I have yet to get any in game currency and don't own any special mechs.I have to say the game is better this time around.I die alot, I get blasted by LRMs, I am certainly not THEB33F but I also kick some♥♥♥♥♥from time to time and have fun.If you are looking to play for a weekend and have all the stuff then this isnt the game for you. if you get frustrated in games you can't lone wolf to get all the kills then this isnt the game for you. You have to take the good with the bad.Don't take MWO to seriously, have a plan on what you want to accomplish, do your research on how to play and you will find a great lobby shooter that stays exciting.

												Great game if you love vehicular combat simulators. Lots of 'mechs. Lots of customization. NOT a pay to win game! The only downside with this game is that it is Multiplayer ONLY. Implementing a singleplayer/co-op mission mode against A.I. would be really great for the more casual players who just want to hop in their mech and have some fun, alone or with friends, without the frustration that comes with the multiplayer arena.

												Matchmaking hasn't been fixed since I started playing. Tier 3 forces you to play against people between tier 5 and tier 1, lowest vs highest skill.Dying community is not assisting in any way and a very large number of individuals are toxic and will moe lances around just to mess with people.Grind is okay in my opinion, but it's understandable how so many people would be irate at earning only 200k (If you win and do well, otherwise expect only 50k in earnings) when a light mech requires 6 mil in cbills.With ghost heat, there are OPTIMUM build in this game. Go either Gauss Rifles, or an ERPPC supported by lasers. For lights: Take an SRM boat or a mech with jumpjets and the ability to mount an ERPPC to poptart with. No other way to play the game and be effective.Horribly balanced as a result of ghost heat and that DOUBLE heatsinks only provide a piddly 15% increase in heat dispersal, and guaranteed to only get worse with the suggested 'energy drain' mechanic.No map differentiation. Every map is either an open plain or an open plain with mountains occasionally in the way. Even the 'urban' maps are still an open river with cover on either side or a mountain with no real cover at all. There are no maps built towards brawling, being in close confines, and no map statistic variation such as E/MAG blanketing from tabletop (Which stops your radar from working properly), hints that close range combat with non-light mechs is a  pipe dream.Developer: Stop adding mechanics and just give us tabletop battlemech construction rules. Give us better and more complicated maps. Give us the option and ability to play more than one type of mech.If you want to play a Mechwarrior game... well... look up a game called MechWarrior: Living Legends. Buy the appropriate Crysis title. Play that instead.			"

												First of all as a long-time player before the steam release, my hours clock in at around 300. If you don't believe me and you're one of the 2 other people who use the Raptr gaming client, go look me up there.Mechwarrior Online is a shooter that brings a lot of unique things to the table, and while I could tote the customizibility and unique feel of each chassis that makes owning over 60 mechs feel insufficient, I'd rather just explain the main reason I love this game so much. Not only is this a ""thinking man's shooter"", rewarding tactical thought and teamplay to a far greater degree than most others, Mechwarrior Online also has an immense skill-cap. Pilot skill has more to do with the effectiveness of any given build than any other factor. The game is well balanced in the sense that everybody has access to the same tools to make their mech perfectly suit them, and once you find those builds that just feel right, you can take on a 100 ton direwolf in a 35 ton panther with nothing but 4 lasers and come out with a solo kill as long as you know what you're doing. But this game doesn't only reward individual skill: far more valueable is your ability to position and work with your team. That's what makes the release of this game to the broad audience of steam so exciting. Players who are used to voice chatting with random strangers (hint: the current community does not utilize the built-in VOIP at all) and who can breathe some life into this stale yet unusally friendly and passionate community. The learning curve is steep, but at its peak lies a game that you can sink just as many hours into as TF2 and CS:GO only with a kind of gameplay you won't find anywhere else. And ignore those people who complain about ""paywalls""; the developers frequently hold challenges where everybody can earn rewards such as the paid currency (in good amounts, too), mechs, mechbays, and colors, as well as a ton of in-game currency. My only advice to new players is: stay behind cover and check your mechs for ghost heat (when you fire too many of the same weapon at once they generate exponential heat). While this game is definitley not for everyone, it's definitley something worth trying to see if it's for you.			"

												Would like to recommend but...The pros; Mech combat feels great, they have some nice custimization available. Battles can get fairly intense. The game can be very enjoyable. The addition of events helps makes things feel a little more fresh. They seem to always be adding new mechs and maps. The cons;My biggest beef with the game is that its really only feels like its half a game or that its still in beta. There is no single player, there is no coop mission modes, only multiplayer deathmatches. To which you will be doing the same death ball attack pattern in every match. There is different factions but really there is nothing that makes you feel like you are on two different sides. I get that its free to play so maybe no single player camp, doesn't mean i give it a pass as the in game charges more then make up for it being ""free to play"". At the very least coop event missions or something that actually utilizes the lances and brings in mission objectives and tells a little story. Encourages people grouping up. Bring back that squad feeling that the previous games had. You will also find that you and a few others stand against the rest of the team while the rest of your team run and hide. This happens at an alarming frequency. No faults of the devs but i feel this goes to the previous point of no small group work.  There is other issues but they are small in my books, hit boxes around objects can get frustrating, weapons will be hitting air and wont be getting past. Some places in the map's where if you hop up on jump jets you will bounce around like a trampoline but really i'm not too worried. Jump jetting is still very buggy, blown off legs from jumping bugs? One of the bigger bugs is warping that happens when you get too close to an enemy mech. All of a sudden the enemy isn't in your sights but a few feet over. Little glitchyOveral i would like to recommend, could just be my childhood influencing that but there just isn't enough here. Numerous bugs that go uncheck, team balance issues where 12-2 is frequent in hours of playing, events are the same thing with a different package on. Feel like this free to play model makes developers think they can release half a game and say its complete; now would you like to do some in game purchases for $60 for a mech.			"

												As a long time Battletech / Mechwarrior fan I've been one of the suckers who bought the super expensive Legendary founder package and Phoenix package. I've played MWO since closed beta, stopped playing some time ago. On the PLUS side I have to admit the game looks nice and is mostly fun to play. On the other hand the game and its developers have also disappointed severely, never really delivering on the promises. Development is slow and new release sometimes introduced more bugs than it solved. Wild changes in mechanics or effectivenes of individual weapons happened every few months, rendering previously successfull mechs useless. It felt that devs never really listened to the community. The contents (mech packs, camo paints) are incredibly expensive. Progression is non-existent, there is not much to aspire to. It is just a brutal grind to earn XP for one mech, then for another variant of the same chassis, and for the next one......... or grind to earn credits to buy the next chassis. And let's not forget MWLL - the free Mechwarrior-like game that was at least as good as MWO and had to be killed to make room for MWO.			"

												This is great example of a game that should have been a classic, but instead is merely mediocre.The graphics and sound are decent, and it is a good foundation on which a great game could have been built, but wasn't. Essentially the game is just an arena combat game using mechs  - there is a Community Warfare mode which seems very unpopular, but really the game is just deathmatch. Having played on and off since the original Beta, I can't help but feel that if the developers had put a little more effort into fleshing the game out with a bit more depth and variety it could have been so much more. Essentially the game we have now is little more than the core functionality upon which a game world could have been constructed. Calling it an MMO in its current form is pretty funny really, as there's only the skimpiest of metagames or player interaction. This would be fine for a simple FTP game, but as the inheritor of one of Sci-Fi's finest (if cheesiest) franchises, and bearing in mind the frankly incredible amounts of real money demanded for Mechs, it's just not enough. In addition the rich lore and background of the Battletech universe has been largely ignored or contradicted when large parts of it could have been exploited much more cleverly.In my view the IP should never have been given to these developers (or indeed their even shadier former publishers) and I'm afraid it seems that they just weren't up to the job of turning out a solid game that's worth the money that so many have already spent on it.

												I've played this game off and on since 2012, starting with the Founder's beta.We'll start with the good things: the core gameplay, is solid and actually works fairly well.  The weapon effects are nice and some of the artwork is very good.    The game has very good sound design and effects.Now, for the bad: everything else.It is an arena shooter with long queue times, lousy matchmaking, bad netcode, a terrible community, and terrible balance decisions.  It is extremely grindy, the cash shop packs are insanely overpriced, and development on the game has been virtually non-existent for three years now.   Oh, and the game is extremely buggy.  And I can provide examples.Let's begin with the queue times.  My average wait to get a solo match in the 'public' arena game queue is usually about three minutes.  My average wait to get a group game (groups have an entirely different queue) in my last play session was over five minutes per match.  The average wait to get a community warfare match during peak hours is typically about fifteen minutes.  Sometimes, after waiting for fifteen minutes, you don't even get a real match, but instead you're forced to grind out turrets for minimal reward.Let's continue with the matchmaking system, which recently ditched ELO in favor of a 'skill tier' system that is actually just a grind.  If you win a match, your skill rating will improve.  If you lose a match, but displayed more activity than a moldy potato, your skill rating will improve.  The game literally rates player skill based on the number of matches someone has played.The netcode is bad.  You can play the game and see for yourself, if you don't believe me.  However, suffice it to say that it is entirely normal in this game for shots to simply fail to register on the target at all, or for other weird things to happen, such as taking fire from the front and noticing that the damage registered on your back.---The game is badly balanced, because the designers of the game do not understand their own game.  With every other game update, certain mechs and/or weapon systems will go from being completely worthless to utterly overpowered, and there is absolutely no rhyme or reason to how, when, or why this will happen.  Actually, I take that back; I do know why balance changes happen.  When the lead game designer actually deigns to wade in and play his own game, he is typically embarrassed on account of being awful and not understanding what's going on.  But rest assured, that he will nerf the hell out of whatever killed him, because clearly that must be overpowered.  For instance, look up ""Goons Heart Paul"" on Youtube and then consider that the mech knockdown mechanic was COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM THE GAME FOREVER in the patch immediately after that video was recorded.Oh, and there are also two different levels of technology in the game.  Inner Sphere (IS) technology, and the more advanced Clan technology.  Clan mechs are faster, more durable, and hit harder.  They participate in the same matches as IS mechs, and there is no penalty on the player for bringing a Clan mech into battle.  You may have noticed that the Clan mech packages are more expensive than the IS mech packages.  Surprise, that's because they're better! ---When I say the game is grindy, I mean that the game is grindy.  You get a huge cash bonus in your first 25 matches, enough that after playing 25 games, you will be able to afford a mid-sized Inner Sphere battlemech.   Then you have to buy equipment for it.  Double Heat Sinks: 1.5 million c-bills, MANDATORY on all IS mechs.  Endo-Steel structure, MANDATORY, will run you maybe another million c-bills.  That's not counting the weapons and engine you're going to have to buy when you customize your mech, assuming you actually want to run a good build on it so that you can be competitive and kill people. Note that you have to buy three variants of each chassis (full price!) to ""elite"" a mech, which is ultimately necessary to be on even footing with veteran players.---Development on this game has been dead pretty much since release.  I don't think I need to go into fiascoes such as Transverse (when the developers decided to abandon development of MWO in order to try to kickstart a Star Citizen ripoff) or the $500.00 gold mechs (Google it), but ultimately the development of this game has been nothing but one mech pack grab deal after another, with pretty much no development at all of new gameplay features or content.  The game is buggy.  The HUD is frequently glitched or displays incorrect information (generator displays were broken for MONTHS in Community Warfare matches), but is also poorly optimized and tanks the game's framerate.  Crash to desktop remains a persistent issue.  I wish I could add more, but the character limit on Steam reviews prevents me from doing so.			"

												Solid F2P game that is not P2W.  If you like Battletech, this is a pretty good arena shooter set in that realm.  The mechaniics are NOT the same as tabletop...because, frankly, that would not make for a good FPS.I recommend new players join a unit like The Praetorian Legion[praetorian-legion-merc-company.enjin.com] and going through BootCamp.  It will give you everything in the tuturial plus reveal a variety of hidden mechanics in the game.A variety of guides and new player friendly advice can be found on the official reddit OutreachHPG.

												Great game, Gimmicky name:MechWarrior Online is bar-none one of the greatest team based shooters out there. It is extensively well balanced and has a great deal more strategy and teamwork than any other shooter I've played. The mechs are diverse and in the right hands even a garbage mech can be a war hero on the field of battle. Moreover there aren't any game breaking builds, which is unheard of in competive multiplayer games. It has a steep learning curve and takes awhile before you can find a mech that best suits you, but once you do the game is extremely rewarding.My biggest complaint about the game it is the name. MechWarrior Online sounds like a trashy free to play mech game so the fact that this is free to play doesn't do itself any favors as far as marketing goes. I've been a fan of the MechWarrior games for over a decade but I took years to try this because I assumed it was going to be a piece of crap due to its name. My Steam friends don't want to try it for this sole reason.Beside the name I have no issues with the game itself, in fact I would say this is leagues better than other strategy based shooters like CSGO for instance. If you are looking for a game more involved than hiding out in a bomb simulation I would highly recommend this.			"

												I've played MWO for a bit over a year now, and it's the only game I've consistently come back to in that time. I really loved MW2 experience and seeing the mech lab for the first time and customizing my mechs really brought those feelings back. Then dropping into a match and unleashing destruction upon the enemy is extremely satisfying and cathartic. Good play is often rewarded and you can really see your tactics help. There are rolls from both sides, but there are the games that both teams had something great going for them and it gets down to one or two mechs left dueling it out. Those are such great moments that really keep your on the edge of your seat, especially while spectating after having dropped earlier in the match. The faction play is fun, but still has room to grow. There will be a 3rd phase update soon that will hopefully add a lot to the game mode. The faction play is a bit difficult and higher skill level than the normal solo queue or group queue. I highly recommend new players tough it out in those queues before attempting the face-rolling potential of faction warfare. This game definitely has my support and I'll still be playing it for years in the future, I think. This is one of those games that I'll constantly come back to. That list of those games is short, but there was definitely a FPS Mech shaped hole in that lineup that this game fills.			"

												MWO has come a long way from where it was when I started playing it in January of 2015. PGI has made great strides at improving MWO.Now how is the game itself now? Pretty darn good. The game is easier to get into than say World of Tanks or WarThunder as everyone has access to to pretty much everything from the start. With the playingfield far more level you also do not get oneshotted as easily making MWO far more forgiving to the new player.When trying to learn MWO do the tutorial, do the optional parts of the tutorial not just for the bonus Cbills but also to get a better idea of how mechs handle. Learn how each weapon system handles, look up some guides, and if you are in doubt, suck up the high price tag of clan mechs and get one with your cadet bonus. Trust me it is worth it, use it to learn how heat works, how to torso twist, get yourself a Hunchback, Stormcrow or Timberwolf and go to town. Seriously go grab a Stormcrow it is one of the most forgiving medium mechs in the game. If you want to get an Inner Sphere mech? Hunchback, any of them, but, best would be the one with the AC/10 which is the Hunchback HBK-4H. The Hunchback and Stormcrow are very, very forgiving and flexible mechs. Also everyone wants to pilot a heavy mech as well, so a medium mech will help with queue times.Another advantage of grabbing a clan mech first is that when building your mech you have far less things that you can do wrong, like under-engining your mech and making you an easy target. Get to also know what the various upgrades do for your mechs, get to know how much ammo you use.Reading guides on the meta is a good idea, it will give you an idea of what you will be fighting, it will also give you an idea of the weaknesses of each weapon system is and strengths. You do not, and I stress this, and should not blindly follow the meta, learn why the meta is the way it is so you can tune your mechs to capitalize on how the game works.Most of all, find what you enjoy to run in your mechs and run it. Also don't forget to find some friends, look up the faction team speak servers and do group queue drops. Trust me, working with friends or just communicating in general will do more for your match score, cbills, and exp gains than any metamech build.Before getting into Faction play, otherwise known as Community Warfare you should get a good grasp of how your mechs work and get four of them that add up to 240 tons. Make certain they are all basiced.MechWarrior's, I look foward to meeting you as friend and foe on the battlefield.			"

												Don't even think about starting MWO.If you love the lore or story you started playing a long time ago, for all others this game just falls flat.The grindwall for new players is gigantic, even if you pay for exp-boosters in this F2P game.  The new skill system currently on the PTS will probably do very little to change that. If you decide to spend money in this game the return per buck spend is very poor. Mech packs or Exp-Boosters are very expensive, the cosmetic patterns are chassis specific and you even have to pay for the colors (account wide) you'd like to use.The asymmetrical balance widens the gap between new players and veterans with clantech being better and more customizable but also too expensive for most new players.The lore (and playerbase) prevent all adempts to balance or enhance the gameplay. Because of the small playerbase and to reduce wait time, the matchmaking system doesn't take any skill into consideration but only matches similar tonnage of mechs.This means as a newcomer with a standard mech, no modules, no map- or timing-awareness you WILL match against the best players this game has in their completely outfitted, optimized Mechs.There are different game modes like Capture the Base or Conquest, but 90% of all games end with killing off one team, making them essentially all team deathmatch on a limited set of maps.Faction play, supposed to be the serious end game, is played on a random map/game mode with 4 mechs for each player.Additionally to the flaws in Quick Play the matchmaking here also pairs random groups with 8+ player premades resulting in lots of games being spawncamps starting after the first wave of mechs.With your limited (not optimized) mech pool as a new player there is no chance to get into serious organized group play in a reasonable amout of playing time.Edit: As discussing game balance in a game review is pointless I striked the balancing part of the review and also the skill tree part because it has been (indefinitely) postponed.

												MW:O was my first contact with the Battletech universe.I started playing around october 2014 and did enjoy the game from the beginning. Although, at this time, there was almost no help for new players and the whole game was quite confusing.But I kept playing and with the help of some other players I got the hang out of it and since then I just love the game (and the whole universe, which I learend about after getting both legs in the game).You have endless combinations of 'Mechs to build, tons of different 'Mechs, with tons of different variants. Every variant can be customised with a lot of weapons and equipments. You don't need to take ""meta"" builds and you don't have something like ""the OP super cool"" 'Mech. More importantly than the meta is, that you find a 'Mech and a fitting, which suits your very own playstile. Although, of course, some people would disagree: I would say the game is balanced good and you can have a lot of fun with every 'Mech.There is absolutly NO need to pay money, if you don't want to.You won't get an advantage ingame, for paying real money. But there are some variants, which can only be achieved via real money (or premium currency won by events). But these 'Mechs (called ""Hero"" and ""Champion"" 'Mechs) aren't better than their ingame-currency-variants. They ""only"" give you the ability to gain more income or more XP from battles (30%).Real money can only be used to lessen the ""grind"", but if you play regularily, you won't need to spend money, you can get enough income over time to afford your own hangar full of 'Mechs :)The game is developed further, every two weeks there is an update on tuesday, which provides new content, or updated game aspects.You should try MW:O and make a decision for yourself :)A happy MechWarrior.

												Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10DISCLAIMER: Please do not be fooled by my amount of time played on Steam. I have been playing this game since Beta 2012, so I assure you I have many, many hours logged on this game. More hours logged then all other games I own combined for that matter!Review:This is an excellent game with great potential and a bright future ahead! I recommend this game for anyone looking for more tactical gameplay in their FPS gaming.Last year, the devs introduced Community Warfar, a gamemode targeted at hardcore players with an entire star map and several factions to fight for. If you decide to give this game a shot, I recommend shying away from this gamemode for the first while until you get a grasp of the main concepts of combat roles and loadouts, and decide this is a game you want to continue with. If you make it to ComWar, you will enjoy increased rewards, frequent events, and the final end-all Battle for Tukayyid Tournament to end each season of ComWar. ComWar is currently in Beta II, with Beta III just around the corner. In Beta III, players will be able to choose from several unique Career paths, vote on planets to attack, pool C-bills for tactical bonuses & ordinance (TACTICAL NUKE CONFIRMED), and perform either full out planetary Assault or planetary Scouting missions to collect intel for additional bonuses.The devs are continuously pumping out new content in the form of Battlemechs, Camo, (coming soon) Decals and Maps. They are also dedicated to perfecting player balance as much as possible, so one can expect one or two updates to gameplay mechanics every month, on top of new content updates.MechWarrior Online got off to a rough start in 2012. Whether you talk to the haters or the lovers, everyone can admit this fact. This was largely due to the now defunct company Infinite Games Publishing (IGP) and its control over the project. The good news is that since its departure, progress on this game has been swift and positive. The game's 'mech concepts are lauded as one of its strongest points, with much of the beautiful 'mech designs now slated for use in the upcoming turn-strategy game Battletech (if you don't know about this game, also worth a look! www.battletechgame.com).The game's UI has been improved frequently, but new players will still have some difficulty navigating some tabs. Notably, new players may struggle with customizing loadouts. My best recommendation for this is to visit the game's forums (mwomercs.com/forums/) and get advice from the playerbase, most of whom are very helpful.The game's Tutorial zone has been revamped recently! All new players should visit this zone first, because this is not a game that you can simply skip the tutorial unless you are a returning player (the tutorial even has in-game rewards for completing challenges). As a veteran player, I still use this zone to practice with new 'mechs.Some may get turned off buy the game's MC currency (money purchasable currency) that allows players to skip a lot of the grind and get the good stuff. While this game may seem Pay-To-Win, this is certainly not the case, as virtually all chassis, weapons, equipment and upgrades are purchasable with C-bills (gameplay generated/earned currency). The only things unobtainable without MC are vanity items & a select group of 'Hero' mechs that come with unique camo patterns and weapon hardpoints (which are arguably no better or worse in performance when compared to their standard counterpart). Also purchaseable with MC-only are designated 'Champion' 'mechs, but do not be fooled! These mechs are simply optimized versions of standard C-bill purchasable mechs, they do not differ at all in performance potential!In summary, this is a great tactical shooter with very unique gameplay concepts. As such, the learning curve can be rather steep for some, and there are still a few rough spots that require development. The future of this game is bright, however, with constant updates and some really exciting new content lined up for spring. In the words of the game's devs, they are ""far from finished"" with this game!			"

												I recommend this game if you're a fan of MechWarrior or if you're looking for something unique amongst the F2P catalogue.MechWarrior Online is definately a game worth trying simply because it is free. But be warned: the game is very grindy and difficult. Matches will seem unfair to someone new. This game is slow paced, which is different from other shooters.This game is also very niche. Even if the game was perfect, most will not like it because it's only fun for certain people.The main issue this game faces is the grindy nature of the game. You will spend a lot of time playing to get the end game stuff, which is acceptable. However, you have to specialize in a mech (buying three varients of the same mech) in order to get high-level ""masteries."" If you make the wrong choice, you could find that you just wasted millions of C-Bills (in-game currency) trying to play.Real-money prices are also high. So expect to drop serious coin if you want a small advantage. Like with everything in this game, you have to educate yourself before you buy. You might not like that sweet mech you just spent 10 dollars for. Personally, I don't mind throwing a little money here and there to stack up my real-money currency, because it adds up fast. To cut on the grind, you can throw some money for an XP and C-bill boost, which is nice and adds 50% to all earnings. Certain mechs that cost real money also carry a XP or C-BIll bonus when using them. You could be earning upwards to 70% extra money and XP due to these mechs.Overall, try this game out. I love it, but it's still a work in progress. The say it's released, but they need to address some things.			"

												Its quite simply the best stompy robot game out there, and its the first game of the Franchise for years, that isn't homebrew, if you like Battletech, Mechwarrior, or  just shooting stuff with Lasers piloting a big♥♥♥♥♥♥♥robot, then you should try this game.Its not a fast paced game, unless you play a light, but that doesn't mean it takes little skill, you have to be aware of your surroundings, and work as a team, Rambo's that think individual skill will win all before them, are going to be the scrub that fails, as TTK is high when your focus fired on, and there is a high learning curve, unless you are an exceptional gamer, you are not going to master this game in a week, or even a month, for many players, but people that genuinely desire a challenge, should take to this game.Now the negative first for old time Battletech,Mechwarrior fans, last paragraph more general.Its the least like the franchise that has been produced, though it looks visually great, there are only mechs no support troops of aircraft, P.G.I decided that they couldn't produce a match maker that has uneven numbers in teams, so clan tech will not be recognised as anything like as powerful as it is in Lore, athema for clan fans, myself I never liked the OP bestest mechs that brought totalbalance fail, so I'm fine with it.Customisation is also a balance issue, though hundreds disagree. None of the load outs will look anything like the Canon mech's which is pretty sad, if you are a real hard core fan of the old lore. Very few close to Canon builds  work in comparrison to what you can  built with the custom system, its sad to see Warhammers, and Marauders, handing in their AC5's SRM's and of couse PPC's, for laser and more lasers.  or warhammers with twin AC20's where the Machine guns went.This is I'm afraid from my point of view the big negative, even ignoring the lore and the canon builds, the game has lots of weapon systems but  various  hit detection issues and the use of HSR has made many weapons nonviable and turned the game into a lasers with everything meta, because they are hitscan and can have the beam corrected, as opposed to point of impact damage which can be ducked more easily,  and at times miss because  hit dection is out, so a PPC is a rare sight on Mechwarrior online, and that says a lot, because if there was an Iconic weapon in  the lore it  is the Partical Projection Canon, but sadly  the Laser Aces it in every way.

												A word from a Legendary founder who crowd-funded the start of this, and a veteran of Closed/Open beta.This game has a steep learning curve, but does not restrict you to underperforming mechs like War Thunder does with its tier system.The grind is as expected of a F2P title, plus there is no glimmer of P2W, most complains about P2W come from players who just end up running into freshly relesed mech piloted by veterans.A word on the mech packs, they first sell them as preorders(mostly), after release they are locked only to the people who preordered them, after some time they can be bought for MC(like golden eagles in WT, or RP in LoL), then some time after that they are released for c-bills( your ingame monopoly money). So there is no mech chassis that is permanently locked behind a paywall. Play the game for yourself and form your own opinion on it.Good luck mechwarriors. "

Good teamplay is vital to winning but commander interface is poorly implemented. Game has a beta level of quality with slow developement and a plethora of long lasting bugs. Some maps are more finished than others. Official support is nearly nonexistant. Grind is tough on normal players. Hard to tell game has been out for over 3 years. Game can be very expensive if you choose to buy into it. Pros: Good concept art. Good graphics at times. Mechs and weapon effects look nice. Easy to understand controls. Fun and established lore. Lots of seasonal content. Fills stompy robot niche. Short matches.			"

The new tutorial is the easiest 6mil cbills you'll make, perfect to buy a mech you want, or you can run the trials for the first few matches and get a nice Cbill injection as well.

												Its a good game. Feels like a slowed down version of Armored core with a harder lock on system. That said, this game feels more achin to chess then to Armored Core. You will die from the pawns as a queen, knight, rook whatever, if you are in the wrong spot. Through trial and error or success you'll learn where risky places are and where safe ones are and how to pander to bad situations or simply to know when you've been outclassed. You WILL be outclassed, some people are simply better. Good news is, its not about how quickly you can sight cross hairs on someones head from 100 meters (although you if you get good at that in this game you will wreck) its about awareness and team cohesion.The mechs DO look amazing, all the hype about the models is real. They look amazing. THe maps are.... interesting. They range from super long range, to super short range, but there is no way to say whether as a short range mech, you get the map you want. I feel that not all the maps have somewhere where every play style shines. I look to TF2 for map design, and feel they did very well. There are tight corners, little nooks, long corridors, hoppable outcrops and cover smattering everywhere; all things, that each seperate class looks for to allow them an advantage. Not quite so in this. Pretty much it plays similarly to real life. Life occasionally hands you lemons and you need to deal with it.THe rewards system i would like to see buffed, but as it is, being a heavy brawly mech is the best way to get C-bills *in game currency*It is NOT pay to win. Eventually, everything that you can pay for with $$$ you can also pay for with C-bills. *with some exceptions* eg. hero mechs. (which don't break the game, just another variant of existing mechs)I recommend this game. Its a solid title that will scratch the mech-customization-fps itch some people may have. Its not the best, but as far as mech games on a PC goes,  its brilliant.			"

												Okay, so... Here's the thing. Although steam only says I have 1.3 hours in this game, I have a total of roughly... I don't know, I don't feel like doing math. Let's just say I play an hour to three hours of this five-six days a week, roughly, and have been doing so for the past year.I grew up playing Mechwarrior IV Mercenaries and the Battletech Tabletop game. And I loved both. MW4 was fun as hell, even if it completely screwed canon. There was not really a ""learning curve"" to it. And that's not even going into the arcad-y shoot 'em up that was the Mechassault series.So, Mechwarrior Online is interesting. It's the closest to tabletop rules a Mechwarrior game has gotten to in recent memory. But it's player versus player only, undoubtedly a loss or turn-off to a lot of people. And there's a hell of a learning curve to it, seriously. People play a few matches, freak out because they die every time, and give up, leaving a bad review before even actually getting to play. To like this game, to get good at this game, you have to put in the effort. You have to grind for experience-not in-game currency/mech experience, *Actual* experience. You have to know your mech, you have to know your role, you have to know the maps. For as much of a ""Thinking Man's Shooter"" as this game used to be, it still is, even if people say it's not (And they are wrong.). You *NEED* to use teamwork. You *NEED* to communicate. Otherwise, your team gets rolled, and it's a slippery slope when you try to get out of the hole you dug yourself and the rest of your team by lone wolfing it.Don't let the nay-sayers get to you. This really is a great game, but you have to be willing to learn to play it. About a 7.5/10, in my opinion, and it's slowly getting better for me personally even now, especially with the upcoming Summer updates.			"

												Have been playing this game since closed beta. Had some ups and some downs along the way, but the past year has been especially positive with leaps forward in every aspect of the game. New players will find a challenging and rewarding experience here, with a generally very open and friendly community full of people who are patient and willing to help. Keep an eye on twitch.tv as well for players who stream to get some real insight into the do's and don'ts.			"

												Mech Warrior Online is a great videogame that requires skill, and you should all check it out.I strongly recommend that you use the millions of credits you get from the first 25 rounds on a mech that you have tested.The light mechs are great in this game, and they can be very annoying so don't think that size always matters in this game.

												A fairly well executed rendition of the Mechwarrior universe. The game, however, is an obvious cash grab to nostalgic Battletech fans in their late 20s and 30s with disposable income. The expansions/chassis are grossly overpriced and the playerbase is remarkably small for what one would expect.			"

												There's no doubt about it. MWO is a flawed game on a number of levels, and the development of this game has been troubled.I mention all of that because it helps to explain why there are such different views of the game.  The game has fans who enjoy it greatly, and yet certain things with PGI in past years have left some people bitter and angry.  That's reflected in the comments, and so you really need to take both sides with a grain of salt. (Ok, a salt mine.)That said, for the real ""review"" part of this.  For all of its flaws, I find the game to be enjoyable, and it's improved greatly in the last 18 months or so.  To my mind, the fact that I have fun with it is the most important part of the review. It's easy to post lists of flaws and strong points (many of both) and I could certainly add my own list of complaints.  That said, for the flaws, the false starts in development, the game is still fun, and I'm not sure that you can ask any more.			"

												In a nutshell, Mechwarrior Online is a multiplayer battle arena with gigantic robots. Unlike many other games with mechs however, Mechwarrior Online does an amazing job of actually feeling like a robot,rather than a big metal man.Pros:-Looks very nice.-Feels like a real mech. Huge stomping strides and the cockpit rocking are very... Mech-like?-A huge amount of depth and customisation for those who look into these areas.-A blend of medium and fast paced combat and variety of Mech classes for varied playstyles.-Fairly fun to play in general. Very rewarding for team players and those who put in time.Cons:-Very complicated to new players. Can be overwhelming if you're not willing to put in time.-Some cosmetics are incredibly expensive.-There's a lot of grinding to earn enough credits to purchase and upgrade Mechs to a useful level.-Furthermore, many Mechs are rather bad in their stock state, which can be misleading.-Rather mercliess gameplay; no respawns can leave those unprepared feeling destroyed. (Well, you were, I guess)Overall, Mechwarrior Online is a surprisingly high quality battle arena styled game that doesn't getthe attention it deserves. It's  very complex and hard to learn at first, but behind that, it's an incrediblyfun game that can have you playing many more matches than you'll expect. If you enjoy giant robot gamesand are willing to learn, give it a go. If you enjoyed games like Hawken but want something a little more complicated andinteresting, this is your game.			"

Posted: December 14, 2015
												I have been playing MechWarrior Online since closed beta (summer 2012) and have to say that this is one of the most gratifying and addictive games... once you climb the learning curve. The gameplay is unique in that you can customize your 'Mechs with a very wide variety of weapons. There are no re-spawns in 2 of the 3 game modes, which forces you to play smart rather than run and gun, like most FPS games. It can be frustrating to die in the first few minutes of a game (solo and group queue matches are a maximum 15 minutes, but usually average about 10 minutes, while Community Warfare matches typically last 20-30 mins).If you are an FPS gamer, you will appreciate the higher level of tactical play and it rewards good aim and movement. In fact, the component/hitbox design of the 'Mechs really rewards players who have precision aiming. Headshots (cockpit kills) are extremely difficult, but highly satisfying in this game... more so than any other FPS I have played.There are 4 weight classes of'Mechs, ranging from Light through to Assault, and offer you different roles to play within a team and changes your playstyle. Some people specialize in one or 2 roles/weight classes because it suits their playstyle and others are flex players who like variety.Team Damage: Yes, it is a real thing and it is annoying as hell to be on the receiving end from trolls (which are few and far between, I might add). Thankfully, you can monitor your team damage at the end of round info screen. Do keep your firing lanes clear and apologize to your teammates if you accidentally shoot them in the back (where there is MUCH less armour and can destroy weapons or even kill them in one full volley of your weapons if placed in one spot). If you are tabbed out of the game and click back in with your mouse, you will fire your weapons, so please alt-tab back into the game instead.Interface: The out of game user interface in the game has changed a lot over the past couple of years and it still isn't perfect, but it MUCH better than older ones. The lack of customizable UI is understandable, due to the sheer volume of parts that make up the info needed and it still can't all fit on one screen. This is a game that is very complex when played to its fullest potential, yet offers instant action once you become familiar with the ideal builds for each 'Mech. Expect to spend a lot of time initially tinkering with Mechs and unlocking skills and items (modules that enhance your weapons, movement or ability to gather info). The in-game interface is pretty cool and has recently introducted additional info within the cockpit (you can also play in 3rd person view, but it highly affects your aiming for precision shots and people can see you are in 3PV because a drone flies above your Mech... you may get a bit flamed for it, as it can also be a visual cheat due to terrain design).Team-Play/Communications: As with any team-based game, you are highly recommended to find a unit and utilize voice comms, but you can play strictly in the solo queue to build your experience, level up your 'Mechs (skill trees take about 30-40 matches to complete for one Mech chassis), or experiment with different weapon loadouts and heat management. Voice comms are available in game, but not used by everyone. You can mute annoying players quite easily. Clans, House Units or Merc Units (aka guilds) are constantly looking for players and have their tag displayed in game next to their name. If you start to see players with a given tag and like your cohesion (and win rate!) with them, I advise you find out their voice comms info and play with them in a group. Just request to join them in chat or add them as a friend and use the in-game messaging feature.Heat?: Ah yes, heat management... this is a layer of complexity that requires you to really be aware of your heat production caused by weapon use and movement. Learning to squeeze out the most of your Mech takes a lot of time and understanding, but there are some great community resources out there. You eventually can do it by feel, but there are visual and audio cues to help. Overheating causes damage to your internals and you can even blow yourself up by riding in the red too long. In those last ditch attempts to squeeze off a final kill, you can choose to override your auto shutdown when past 100%, but do so wisely! Suiciding due to overheat can still reward the kill to a player shooting at you.Community: there are always toxic players or trolls, but you will find an overall very nurturing community. The game is no doubt a niche game, but has a very, very loyal following with some very big whales who love the BattleTech universe. There is no other multiplayer game on the market quite like this one and it induces a lot of passion within the MWO forums and MWO sub-reddits.eSports: There is a budding attempt to turn MWO into an eSport with a $100K prize pool world tournament starting in Q1 2016. Those in the competitive-minded community hope that enough new players with great skills enter MWO to spawn new teams or revive some old ones that have felt that the competitive scene is stale. Most competitive play is accomplished via community-run leagues (MRBC, RHoD, and a few 8/12/16 team invitationals). The publisher did host one official beta tournament, which brought out a lot of new names to the competitive scene and we hope that will be the case in the near future with the influx of new players from Steam.Pay Model: The game is F2P and used to be very limited in this regard, but has opened up widely since Community Warfare started. Initially you begin with 4 Mech Bays. You had to buy additional ones in the past, but now you can earn them through in-game rewards and special events. There are some Hero and Champion Mechs that are only purchasable with real money (MC), but they are not mandatory to buy. They do offer enhanced XP or C-Bill (in-game currency) bonuses, so it can be a good way to farm cash to buy additional 'Mechs. As with most F2P games, you will end up paying more for this game than a retail box model should you get into it... and there is nothing wrong with that at all! Mech Packs are pricey, but it is more of a pay to early access feature rather than a Pay 2 Play/Win model. There are only a few Hero Mechs that you may want to buy should you wish to get into competitive play. Wait for paid items to go on sale at 50% off to get the best value, which happens often.Matchmaking: There are 5 skill tiers and that is how the base matchmaker tries to pair up players. Sometimes you will be matched with players a tier higher or lower, but the idea is that both sides are matched as evenly as possible. There are also weight and chassis limits per side, so as to maintain some degree of balance of teams. The past saw some issues with queue times due to lower populations, which has been less of an issue since Steam release. However, the Community Warfare (CW) mode still suffers from a lack of popluation due to lack of real incentives to play that game mode vs time per match. We hope that an increased CW population will reduce the wait times and increases the potential of this game mode. More on CW below.End Game: Community Warfare is the persistent universe game mode and is not based on any matchmaking at all, but a specific weight tolerance of the 4 Mechs you can bring to each match. Yes, this is the only game mode where you have respawns, but you still need to use each Mech wisely, as matches are more prolonged with different phases to the fight. There is a defense and an offense mode to each map and new game modes are going to be introduced to increase playability of CW during off-peak times. Here is where you can unlock in-game rewards and also earn MC, the real money currency that can unlock more Mech Bays (character slots, per say), cosmetic items, or even Champion or Hero Mechs, if you grind it out.

												Please note that despite my listed hours played, I've actually been playing since the closed beta.Pros: *Huge* catalogue of 'mechs to choose fromGreat loadout customizationSome good looking mapsConstant stream of weekend events, and tournamentsVisceral and engaging 'mech combatVery active development teamFaction Play/Community WarfareAll competitive/meta grade 'Mechs are avaliable for free-player currency.Mech art design is really quite gorgeousNeutral:Sound design is functionalDevs *can* have a problem listening to the communityUnlocking 'Mechbays pretty much requires paying money, or playing every weekend eventHighish investment price, about on equal footing with World of TanksFrequent sales on cosmetics and paid 'mechs'Unique' XP unlock systemSteep learning curve, but an okay tutorialCons:Jarring disconnect between 'old' and 'new' map design philosophies and qualities.Some 'Mech textures can be downright uglyOnly five gamemodes and 18 mapsCumbersome frontend UISmall team can lead to slow fixes, and glacial development speed on some features.Nickel and dimingPoor optimization leads to a poor performance to fidelity ratioSome bizzare 'balancing' options come down the pipeline, sometimes.Conclusion:It's a great arena shooter, with decent customization depth, but not much to do beyond fighting. Graphics and sound are good. Updates come frequently. The real-money stuff is way too expensive, but anything worth half a damn goes F2P within a couple months anyway. Anything else becomes avaliable for MC, which you can earn for free. The devs can be rather ignorant to the realities of the game's meta, but it kind of, a little bit, maybe seems they're starting to listen to the community, but they could *really* work on that. It's probably worth a download, and some free-play, but keep your wallet closed unless you find you're enjoying yourself.			"

												Its quite clunky, especially the graphics/physics, but overall i enjoy this game, and even decided that its worth spending money on it.The damage/weapon-system is interesting and the battletech universe in which MWO plays is rich in lore and there are over 100 novels since the 80s. The balancing was not good the last years since its release as far as i uncovered (there are 2 sides Clan and Inner Sphere which battle each other with different levels of technology), but there was a recent patch in December which seemed to turn everything to the better. I started late December so i cant tell the difference. :)The game is not overcrowded in CW and its not adviseable to join those as a random because you will get stomped 9 out of 10 matches by highly organised and trained units, but its easy to get into solo battles and pew pew away.If you want to do more team oriented stuff like CW or the soon to be introduced 4vs4, join a unit.There is a skill-matchmaking in place, which has 5 levels.You start with 5, and you can be matched with ppl that are 2 levels up or down.This just grants you to make the first steps in peace, after like 70 hours you come to level 3 and can be matched against the best.If you want to play in the long run, you need at least premium time if you want to get new mechs regularly,but unlike WoT you can buy any mech you want immediately and level it.Its not so easy to get to know the game, since the factions mechs have differences with Omnipod and Quirksystems and the weapons are very different, but if you just use google and read the MWO guide for beginners and the comics, you should be fine to start.If you like vehicle combat, just give it a try.

												I have been playing this game since open just before Clans were added. It is a great game with the chance to be greater, once CW moves into phase 3 (Beta 3). You will find most on community are happy to help new players, including the bigger units/clans. They will share Team speak, advice, and in some case give you a learning match 1 on 1 (if you both have Premium Time). My advice collect all 25 cadet bonuses, complete the mech warrior acadamy, and then look at smurfy (mech build site) to work out the cost to buy and outfit your mech. I found the hunchback (HBK) a great starter as it can boat just about any weapons (Laser, LRM, SRM, Ballistic) and Meduim's cost less to Endo Steel. Look forward to seen you out there.Knight2416General Macross Mercs			"

It is for real, mature players, it is not a plug n play slugfest to fulfill anyones flavor of the week.  FTP, but with a small cash investment, you can get a few moneymaker mechs going to build your foundation.  We buy other games, so dont  see what cash complaints are for.  After a small initial investment, no need to spend money unless you choose to.  All FTP, will jsut take longer to develop is all.  Big thumbs up.  Give it 50 hours before you judge.

There has really been no improvement to performance of the game, they scraped their original Community Warfare idea, which scraped the waiting hours for a game, but it's 9/10 times a steam-roll. So no improvement to the game performance in ~2 years, but cerntainly hundreds more mechs and micro transactions.

												MWO is a very enjoyable game - but it is not a perfect game.  So, let's look at the pro's and con's shall we?  (Also, I played on the original launcher and have only recently moved over, so add roughly 150 hours [over the course of about two years] or so to my 'Time Played' count please)It is a F2P game with good graphics, a stable engine and solid game mechanics - though note that the ""Faction Warfare"" gamemode is still fraught with problems but is still an enjoyable if sometimes taxing on your sanity.It is NOT a BattleTech game - though if you don't know what BattleTech is then you might not care.  I care, but it is still a good game regardless of this VERY important misstep.  The game struggles very much with the technological disparity between IS and Clan machines and equipment - this 'struggle' comes from the artificial 'balance' between the two rather than using the already well-established BattleTech rules that this game is based upon.  VERY important misstep.The player base seems to consist mostly of people who are looking for fun and are willing to help as much as they can rather than to fall under the ""Internet is for a**h***s"" standard of user base.The game does rely on microtransactions, packages and other bits of the game that require real money to be used - HOWEVER - I personally have yet to notice any real ""Pay to Win"" - but the so-called Hero 'Mechs are certainly ""Pay for Variety"" and ""Pay for BattleTech"" - in the case of the Yen-Lo-Wang for example.  NONE of this a bad thing, however, as it is almost solely used to pay the company, expand the options for or allow access eariler to players who are willing to pay for that, but does not allow access to things that give the ""wallet warrior"" any appreciable edge during gameplay.The META is REAL! - Real BattleTech is better.  I play BattleTech in here, it makes it harder but also gives me satisfaction to use that and kill META users...hehehe.While the basics of the gameplay are easy enough to learn (keyboard and mouse), they are a bit more complex than a run-and-gun shooter.  More important than twitch shooting (see above for that) is your ability to read situations, plan ahead and keep awareness beyond often what you can currently see.  It WILL take time to learn the how/when/where of its combat, but it is well worth the struggles earlier on.The best and worst parts of a multiplayer game are the players - what else is new.  No, this is not a contradiction to what I said earlier.  Both are correct and it was worth mentioning twice.  This is a team-based game.  Leave your team or get left behind, and you're life expectancy will drop drastically.  And yes, you will have bad teams, bad luck and bad timing - no honest person will tell you life (or death) is fair.If you like the idea of using a giant walking tank to shoot up other people in giant walking tanks with guns, lasers, missiles, countermeasures, electronic warfare, positioning and maneuvers - and of course are willing to accept its faults (which you really should IMHO)...PLAY THIS GAME!

												Pains me to re-write the reveiw of the game negatively. But after all the years of optimism I just haven't seen PGI making enough good decisions and thus I have lost faith in their ability to fix this game's issues. Nowadays I just see maps being made worse (though some have indeed improved) along with questionable ""balancing"" as well as a continued trend of power creep. While the power creep may not be intentional it still doesn't change the fact that it is there.  New mechs are still constantly released with many having various unbalanced (both under powered and over powered) traits often and they only get ""properly"" balanced when released for cbills (in game currency). However the game itself is still playable and still much better than most other free to play games out there. Skill will still beat out running op builds. And even then most builds can be countered with the correct application of tactics and other builds. I do still recommend trying the game out for yourself. Find a good team and you can still enjoy the game's community (so long as you find the right groups). With PGI now also developing Mechwarrior 5, I do wish the best of luck with that and the fresh start it brings. Hopefully you can learn from the mistakes in MWO and develop a wonderful game from the start.			"

Those expectations are as follows (in no particular order)1) Sweet looking mechs. 2) Decent matchmaking. 3) Sweet looking mechs.4) Varied maps.5) Relatively responsive developers.6) Sweet looking mechs.Only thing that bothers me is the money I have sunk into buying digital robots that look super flippin sweet and are a perfect modern 3D representation of the mechs of my childhood is appalling.10/10 will play like a bad habit until somehow a better MechWarrior game is made.

												Solid game. I'd avoided it earlier when I heard bad things about the dev, but having gotten into it now I'm really enjoying it. Manages to capture some of the classic Mechwarrior feel, and it's a pretty solid tactical vehicle combat game.But whatever you do, don't buy the current steam ""Performance Packs."" These packs are _terrible_ value for money compared to normal in game purchasable items. Use the trial 'mechs for a while, figure out a playstyle you like. The game works just fine at the price of free. If you want to support the game and speed up your progression, research good hero 'mechs to buy ingame a la carte or in a Mastery Pack.

												MWO is a free to play game based on the Mech Warrior series which is based on BattleTech. The mech combat is good, possibly some of the best in the series' history. I've played the TT and franchise for over 20 years and can safely say that at its core, MWO is true to the premise of piloting a big battlemech.There is an extremely steep learning curve for new players that is not helped by lack of good documentation explaining some of the more important mechanics. The community is really good at filling in the blanks though and most are more than willing to help new players get acclimated. The artwork is gorgeous and if you are able to play on higher settings the game really shines. Although a bit dated now, you can see that the artwork is top notch. It's a very fun game, especially being free and I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a new game. This isn't your typical shooter though, it tends to move at a much slower pace when it comes to combat and it is heavily team oriented. Those that try to take down the enemy team solo ala CoD will find nothing but frustrating losses. That's not to say it is without issues. The gameplay itself is repetitive and most modes equate to stomp forward and kill them all. There are additions in the pipeline to include new modes that should break up the monotony but if you're the type of gamer than enjoys a lot of diversity in modes such as CtF, KoH, etc. this may not be your cup of tea. The pathfinding is frustrating, especially when you're stomping along in a 100 ton assault mech and are brought to a complete stop due to a ""rock"" no higher than your mech's ankle. The mech customization is amazing with literally thousands of mech and weapon combinations. It's one of the few F2P games out there that does a very good job of walking that line without getting into P2W territory.    The developers are very responsive and interactive with their community via Twitter which is exceptionally rare in this industry. Overall I would give it 3 out of 5 stars (which could easily jump depending on what the company does with the recently released Phase 3 of Community Warfare). It's a free game and within a few hours of playing as a free player you can easily accumulate enough cbills (the free currency) to buy and outfit 2-3 mechs.  "

												A friend of mine recommended this game and before commiting to it I read a bunch of reviews on this site.  There were several ""Do Not Recommend"" reviews which complained of a grindy nature, lack of infantry/vehicle targets and a power imbalance due to skills unlockable through regular play which noobs have no access to.  So I was pretty skeptical but DLed anyway to give my friend the benefit of the doubt.Gee, I'm glad I got this game.  Despite there being a fair amount of truth to the negative reviews this game is great fun regardless.I would like to address those issues from negative reviews mentioned above:  The game is grindy?  Well, if you call playing a lot of games driving around in giant stompy robots shooting lasers in the faces of other giant stompy robots a grind, I guess it is.  The whole point of the game is to drive around in giant stompy robots and blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up.  Not to level up those skills.  First: Blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, second: gets skills.  Blow♥♥♥♥♥♥up, it's so much FUN!  When you unload on someone with a bunch of lasers or short range missles and their arm falls off or you cripple their leg, or your first solo kill!  Revel in it.No other targets besides giant stompy robots shooting lasers and massive autocannons around the place?  Well, if I was infantry and there were giant stompy robots blowing♥♥♥♥♥♥up all around me, I wouldn't want to be poking my head out.  And if I was driving a tank around said robots, I'd think it prudent to drive away as fast as posible.  There should be NO other targets both from fluff and gameplay perspectives (though there are infantry and vehicles in the original game and fluff, once the Mechs arrive, the little guys don't really matter anymore).IMO, anything other than Mechs as opponents would be a pointless distraction.  Any infantry or light vehicles would have to be AI as they would die in droves, no one would want to play them.  The players are there for the giant stompy robots afterall.  That these have been left out of the game serves to keep the gameplay focused on the PvP, robot vs robot theme of the game.There is an imbalance between newer and experienced players?  And this doesn't happen in any other game?  When you start out in any new game you'll likely to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥handed to you a few times.  The learning curve might be a bit steeper in this game as it doesn't play like a typical FPS, thank Google for variety!  Persevere, click on ""Spectate"" when you get killed, watch how other people are playing, learn and get better.  Games are over pretty short and there are no significant repercussions for dieing in a dozen games, except that you might get a bit better each time.Yes, there are skills that can be unlocked on Mechs which give them small bonuses.  I don't think these are especially unbalancing towards a new player in a trial Mech.  Though it might be if the game was one on one.  It's not, you have 11 other allies backing you up.  In fact, a much more significant factor in whether you survive a game is how well your team co-ordinates together.  And it's also likely that the other team will have as many noobs or vets as your team does.  It balances out.If there is anything i would gripe about it is the cost of purchasable packs.  Especially the Steam bundles.  I'm not sure how they have decided on their pricing for these packs but it would be great if they were about 50% cheaper.  But would they sell 50% more packs?  Saying that i've still bought two 3 Mech* bundles.  These are the lowest tier on the purchasable packs and are pretty good value at $20US.  Even better value if you preorder and get early adopter rewards.  There are also periodic sales on various things in the store.  So if you are patient you can make savings.(*  Three Mechs of the same chassis are required to fully unlock all tiers of skills available and these bundles come with a months premium time which gives extra XP to help you along.  Each chassis also has distinct quirks and weapon hardpoints so you don't have three identical Mechs.  You get decent variety)The game also rewards noobs quite generously with bonus in game currency for the first 25 matchs.  After this time you could get virtually any Mech you wanted that is available for cBills.  Buying bundles is not necessary.So, in summary:  Yes you grind, if you call game after game of robot battles a grind.  If you don't want to battle giant robots you came to the wrwong game.There are no other targets to shoot at or drive around.  If you want tanks there is a game for that.There are skills.  Your teammates will have a greater influence on the battle than the skills will.  See who plays well in your games and Friend them, then ask to group and learn from them.Bundles can be expensive but there is some good value in there too.Your biggest hurdle will be getting past the CoD playstyle and learning to play within the limitations of what sort of mech you are driving.  There is a lot more to this game than running around the map blasting people.Oh yeah, you wont respawn either.			"

												MWO is for you If your looking for a game with individual skill (shooting, torso twisting), battlefield tactics (teamwork is OP) and customization (mech weapon loadout, camo, cockpit).  Don't be discouraged in the beginning (you will die) this is a game that takes effort to play well.  Communication and teamwork are important factors in achieving victory - and necessary for Faction Play.  There are Challenges/Events that give rewards (c-bills, MC, mechbays and even mechs) that really helps with the grind.  They also have sales often so taking advantage of them helps too.  Teamwork brings an whole other dimension to the game and many units have their own teamspeak server.  Joining a unit (the Apocalypse Lancers) was for me a major factor in making the game still enjoyabe to play.  Many veteran players are more than willing to help new players get the most fun out of their stompy robots.			"

												I've played MWO for 3 years almost nightly.It had huge potential and fell short.BUTEven having fallen short, its is still the best Mechwarrior game available.  (Its potential was out of this world)What make me say that?  Gameplay.  Customization of your Mechs. Progression. Teamwork means winning or losing, not how much you paid for your Mech.  To become a great team player and mechwarrior there is a bunch you need to know.  Which brings me to my next point.There's a learning curve.  You'll get your butt kicked for about a month straight until you learn the weapons and the mechs.But if you stick with it then you'll start getting kills which is where the fun begins.JOIN A GROUP TO PLAY WITH.  The game is infinitely better when played on voice comms on TS with friends.Groups will accellerate your learning too as you will be taugh as you play and chat with veterans.The future of MWO is friendly... now that its done spinning its wheels in the mud.  I'm eager to see what they do with the new Community Warfare, Faction Warfare, and balancing.On the subject of joining groups.. Why not take a look at our group.  I've not found a reason to drop with anyone else for three years and counting,  The Skye Rangers have a bit for everone in every timezome.

												Short and sweet - this is a good game with lots of depth for those that want to find it. That will turn some people off but for those that dig in and do some reading and work in getting better it's very rewarding. The only thing to look out for is that some of the community is still pretty upset over some of PGI's early mistakes so there are some overly critical people out there. LIke any community you can jump in with them or ignore them and have a great time playing. It's your game and your choice.			"

												The core game had a lot of promise. A decades old franchise with tons of lore, background story, technology, etc. There has been a great stable of games based around Battletech. While this game has shown off some great mech designs and renders, it falls very short in play-ability, some of the worse Free to Play grind of any other steam game, and a learning curve so severe that the few new players that do try it, leave frustrated. It`s even worse when new players put real money into the game only to be matched by so few, much higher skilled players who have stuck around so long, me included. The game population is so low, wait times are long, and the skill disparity of the so called ""matchmaking"" system will leave new players disappointed. The underlying reasons for these issues start from a unwillingness to listen to the community, and severe censorship of any one who tries to criticize them, including streamers who won`t do what they tell them to do. A once great franchise is being ruined by a inexperienced deceitful game company.			"

												I've been playing MWO since closed beta, Summer 2012.  Four years is a loooong time to be playing any one game, but it's kept me and my crew together.  If you want heavy firepower wielding mechs, this is pretty much the best game in town.  Less twitchy than other FPS titles so better for older players.  The Good:Art and Design of the mechs.  By far this is the best that battlemechs have ever looked in a video game.  Just go look at MW4 and cringe.  While a few of the redesigns were a bit of a miss (looking at you WarHammer), the major are unbelievably good (Atlas, Catapult, Cataphract, Summoner) etc.  Even o es that never looked that good to being with (Jager mech, Stalker).  Gameplay is solid.  The arm+torso movement for aiming is simple brilliant and this is the best mechs have ever handled.  Assaults (except Kodiak...) feel heavy and methodical.  While something as small as the Locust feels insanely fast and nimble.  Mech customization is damn near infinite.  Not very chassis can do what you want, but there's a mech or variant somewhere that CAN.  Build variety and the near endless way to build a mech is solid.  Negatives:Harsh to new players.  Much like Eve, opening this game up the first time is less of a learning curve and more of a vertical WALL.  There is finally a new player tutorial for driving a mech, but still absolutely nothing for the mechlab.  That said, the community is very helpful, and there are many community run Team speak servers avail with people glad and willing to show players the ropes.  Tiny community.  MechWarrior just isn't that big anymore.  While huge during the 90s, it's very much a niche product today.  After 11 or so Pacific, you'll start seeing familiar faces every drop or two.  Just not a big enough pool to build matches.  Big fish in little ponds.  This game has a ""Pilot Skill Rating."". (PSR) Basically it's an XP bar that fills to move you up in tiers.  Play really poor early on and you'll probably start at Tier 5, and over time you'll move up.  Big issue is it is HEAVILY biased to move players up, so you'll hit tier 3 pretty quick.  After that you're just food for the Tier 1 elite crowd.  They tend to be the players that support the game the most financially buying the pre-order mech packs, so to keep them entertained the game is geared to throw easy targets at them.  Unless you run with a crew that WANT to be the best and focus fire and build to the meta, you're going to be rolled a lot at higher tiers.  My crew is a very casual group that play because we love big stompy robots and want to play something that supports 2 to 12 of us at a time.  But because the PSR is biased so heavily, most of us are tier 1 or 2, but we're NOT that caliber of players.  We've just played enough it shoves us against MS, 228, KCOM, etc.  So we get rolled. Small community though so MM is designed to put as many people into the same port as quickly as possible.  Limited game modes.  You've got Assault (kill everything or capture their base), Conquest (kill everything and capture enough bases), and Skirmish (kill everything).  There's none of the real objective based gameplay that MechWarrior is known for.  There was an attempt with community warfare for two years, but it's largely died off because of poor design and developer miss steps.  Glacial development.  The last real issue is development is at a snail's pace.  The core gameplay really hasn't changed since Alpha.  They do have mech creation down to a science, but actual Ballance changes or adjustments are once yearly, at best, with huge imbalances receiving no attention for months at a time.  Overall what you see is what you get with MechWarrior Online.  I don't see it changing much in the next two years, but for solid Team Death Match with Robots, it's pretty much unbeatable.  Just don't go in expecting the Battletech or MechWarrior heritage for objective based gameplay or more.  It's not here			"

												Closed Beta player, so I have been there from the beginning in 2012. The game has substantially evolved since that time period, from 5 'Mechs and a single map with 8 vs 8 and one game mode (Assault), to 3 Quick Play modes, 2 Faction Play modes, 12 Quick Play maps, 7 Faction Play maps, over 60 'Mech chassis (totalling 300 variants), 12 v 12, and a host of other improvements.But this review isn't about a chronological list of stuff that happened, you wanna know how the game plays, right?The new Player Experience is still a little rough. Once you've gone through the MechWarrior Academy (a welcome recent addition), there's no real tutorials on proper teamplay with other players, as well as any information on customizing your own BattleMech. However, the pace that PGI has been going at of late, this stuff may all come soon.Once you've actually learned basic and advanced tactics, it is a proper BattleMech simulator; your 'Mech has a limited pivoting torso, you have loads of weapons on your 'Mech that can make you overheat if you're not careful, and of course, speed is still life. Assault 'Mechs, the biggest of them all, do indeed struggle with much smaller 'Mechs (such as almost all Light 'Mechs, and the Cicada and Ice Ferret), because of the much slower pace of the lumbering giant compared to the relative agility of the gnats surrounding it. This sort of inherent balance, coupled with different scouting mechanics that feel closer to World of Tanks than previous MechWarrior games (a good thing) already makes this feel more balanced and visceral than those earlier MechWarrior games.Maps can and do restrict tactics in places, and many  of these maps can also change up the gameplay or make it stale. They're not quite as pretty or realistic as some of today's AAA titles, but I think they're very much sufficient for what they're trying to do, especially for trying to realize BattleTech's universe.All this and I forgot about the pricing model. 'Mechs are EXPENSIVE when paid for with real money. If you want to build a collection, you will have to fork over a little money for MechWarrior Credits [MC] and buy some bays, and if you're not patient enough to accrue C-Bills (keep in mind that your first 25 matches, you get a major bonus to get you your first couple 'Mechs sooner), you can buy 'Mechs with MC, too. Fortunately, PGI runs sales and events rather regularly, so you may be gifted with some scraps of MC or some free 'Mech Bays, and rarely, even a new 'Mech! Keep an eye on their website for more information!Give Piranha Games some patience, the greatest has yet to come. They are overhauling Faction Play a bit, and someone's pet project is proper Single Player/Cooperative. TD;DR: This isn't your father's MechWarrior. It comes with its ups and downs but it is very much worth a play. Just be mindful of your wallet, 'Mechs are not cheap.			"

												If you enjoy shooting big robots then this is the game for you. I've played just over 3000 matches and still enjoy blasting mechs.It's f2p done well, you can earn almost every thing in game using the in game currency and there are events most weekends that reward you with ingame currency, cosmetic items and sometimes premium currency and mechs.The game does have some issues however, some of these are the lack of game modes (currently only three) and balance has been an issue in the past but is getting better.Overall I'd reccomend this game, it's fun and free so why not try it out?

												If you're a long-time MechWarrior or Battletech fan like me, you're going to be disappointed. This isn't the game we were waiting for. It doesn't respect the source material, in ways that are especially frustrating because there seem to be some fairly straightforward solutions. Also, through various dumb decisions better explained elsewhere, it's pretty clear that the developers simply don't care about the hard core fans of the series.However!The game itself, taken in isolation, as it is right now, is very good. It's fun to play. So, in all fairness, it gets a thumbs-up. When it's good, it's VERY good. Teamwork is not just rewarded but demanded - if you try to go off and solo you'll get swiftly destroyed and put your team one player down. It can be frustrating when you get a team that scatter like headless chooks, so you'll need to cultivate a bit of a zen attitude, but the good moments are worth it.There's a very satisfying cycle of customising your mechs, trying them out in battle, tweaking them, salivating over the next big engine upgrade or new chassis, taking that out in battle, eyeing the next big upgrade, and so on.I wouldn't spend any money on it, though.NB: I've played for a fair bit before this was on Steam. Apparently I have 97 hours of in-cockpit time all together.-------------------------------------------e: quick PSA here: you need to stick together. You NEEEEEEED to stick together. You also need to use terrain to your advantage. Going off by yourself to try to flank the enemy WILL get you killed. Pushing through a narrow pass WILL get you killed.See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail . You'll be more successful with your whole team fighting together, targeting one enemy at a time, occupying ground that allows your team to focus fire, than you will by trying to 1v1 everyone. Even in the very heaviest mechs, you cannot reasonably expect to win against more than one opponent at a time, and if you win a 1v1 you'll take far more damage doing it than if you and your buddies were focusing on one target instead.Even if you don't agree with where most of your teammates are headed, sticking with them will win more often than going off and doing your own thing instead. Trust me. For the sake of your future teammates' sanity, please stick together.			"

Only negative thing I see is how much worse it is to be new in this game when upgraded mechs is so much better, and upgrading them takes a lot of time. Matchmaker does seem competent enough to match people of similar skill though but I still feel it will make people stop playing early if they don't have any reason to stay (like friends/family who plays).

												If you've ever played a mechwarrior game, the combat mechanics will be pretty familiar to you. All players are offered a variety of trial mechs which change frequently. The trial mechs are very competitive and often 'hero' variants are available as well. If you wish to modify your mech you'll have to buy one with c-bills or real money, which is easily done after playing your first handful of matches. Premium content includes mech patterns (skins), colors, war horns, dashboard bling and experience/c-bill boosts. The built in VOIP is excellent and allows for even random quick match groups to be extremely well organized. Graphics are excellent, audio is excellent, no input lag to speak of.The user interface can be a little overwhelming at first, but after some experience you'll find that the flexibility that comes with having a ton of options can be extremely rewarding.10/10  "

												DISCLAIMER : THIS GAME HAS A MASSIVE LEARNING CURVE, BE PREPARED TO FEEL THE SUCK FOR A FEW HOURS OF PLAY UNTIL YOU GET THE HANG OF IT.I HAVE BEEN PLAYING SINCE CLOSED BETA AND AM STILL PRETTY TRASH.Having put hundreds of hours into this game before its steam release, and with a large number of mechs in my stable without spending a single dime despite having a premium mech and cosmetic items earned entirely from in-game Events (Which happen quite often actually, or did before steam release, we'll see!) I have to say that I enjoy this game far too much, The thing is, even if you buy things you are getting NO ADVANTAGE. This game's ONLY deciding factors are player skill, luck (Just like anything else luck is a factor) and utilizing the built in communications to coordinate with your team.TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS :1. Turn off the ♥♥♥♥ing 3rd person, there's alittle camera drone behind and above your mech with a flashing red light EVERYONE CAN SEE when you're in 3rd Person, and its actually detrimental to your ability to aim.2. Controller support is wonky, and you DO NOT want to use a controller anyway, M&K is going to serve you much better, tracking targets smoothly and quickly is ESSENTIAL in this game.3.Never go out alone, you will die faster than you can say ""What's going on?!""4. Save every C-Bill you earn until you can afford an IS assault or Clan Heavy, then save a few million more to outfit it as best as you can.5. USE OUT OF GAME UTILITIES LIKE SMURFY'S MECHLAB AND METAMECHS. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.6. The community has developed a Utility called ""Fire Control"" it has a weapon toggle feature for things like machineguns and TAG Laser designators, It is not against the game's rules and has other features as well like fire sequencing multiple fire groups instead of MWO's chainfiring mechanic, I only use it for very specific builds that are heavy on constant fire weapons like MGs/Missile boats with a TAG, but it can be used for other things as well.7/10 This game has its problems, and will continue to have problems, but It's had a great year this past year and with it's deadweight publisher IGP gone since like two years ago IIRC PGI has been making massive strides to regain community trust and has produced an enjoyable if frustrating stompy mech shooty game. Its not battletech, but then again mechwarrior has never been battletech, its just set in the same universe!Server Disconnections are semi-common for me its kind of annoying but has been getting better lately.SCREENSHOT! : http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/395552769137893977/105682C1B28BA38BAE6FBF0F31C7C8960EEA272C/ "

												I'm a long time battletech fan that grew up with Mechwarrior 2. I absolutely love the franchise and played Mechwarrior Online before it was ever released on steam. Played closed beta since 2012, and revisited the game after a long hiatus to see how the clan mechs were in game. Revisited the game again and logged in over 400+ combined hours with my profile. Scroll down to TL:DR if you don't want to read this long review.If you are a new player in this game, beward of the skill tree that these devs plan to torture you in the future with. There is a SEVERE lack of commuication between the devs and the player base. While the game has a forum for suggestions, it is often overlooked in favoritism by the devs for Twitter. Yes that's right, Twitter. If you spot something that needs to be fixed in the game or a suggestion I hope you can get your point across in less than 121 words.With this being said, they are planning to drop in something called the Civil War tech era which will introduce new mechs and new technology to try and breathe new life into the game. Sounds good right? Well, PGI has some kind of short sighted vision to make MW:O into an e-sport so ""balance"" takes ""top priority"" (as CEO Russ Bullock tends to repeat) as something akin to CS:GO. May I add that this is the only game in the mechwarrior franchise that has GAUSS RIFLE CHARGE UP TIMES. So wan't a sniper weapon platform for your mech? I hope you like holding down your firing button precisely at the right time or else it won't go off. Not to add on top of that how unlore friendly this entire concept is.Another thing that proves how disconnected PGI is to their own game is when they start nerfing things with no logical reasoning behind them. Certain mechs got hit in the past with nerfs THAT WERE UNDERPEFORMING TO BEGIN WITH. I can speak for myself since the Executioner I have in game feels like a card board cut out than it does a war machine. And while the playerbase rose their voice about it, nothing ever came of it.This doesn't even cover a fraction of the problems that this game has.PGI's dependency of income now is the occasional steam player that might buy a mech pack for $20, and the nostalgic whales that still lurk in the community that are living in denial for a better Mechwarrior title. They already lost most of their founders that backed the kickstarter project for the game. PGI also has unfortunately a monopoly over the battletech franchise title. Their holding over the license won't expire until 2018 to 2020. Rumor has it that they might have been responsible for disbanding titles like Assault Tech 1: Battletech and Mechwarrior Living Legends. Now they are working on MW5:Mercs which will be an single player focused game. Why don't you fix what you have now for more customer confidence if you want people to buy your new game?TL:DR A game that had a lot of potential during that went to the wayside over the years.I'll change this review to a positive one if there are any permanent positive changes. As of right now, I honestly can't recommend this game to anyone. If you wan't your mech simulation fix, I strongly suggest revisiting the older titles or checking out MW:LL for online multiplayer.

												Piranha Games has done an amazing job with the BattleTech/Mechwarrior franchise here. MWO plays a lot like a ""tank"" simulator requiring every pilot to consider range, heat management, hit loctaion, ammunition depletion, weapon payload, and many other details when preparing their mech ""build"" or dropping in to combat. The gameplay reminds me of a mix between Ghost Recon 2, World of Tanks, and Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. I feel like for the casual tactical simulator player, MWO can be pretty punishing. I also think this is one of MWO's many strengths. To be a successful pilot the player will need to be co-opertive (most lone wolves aren't gonna make it), understand good mech build practices, and watch the changing meta-game so as to inform them on those mech builds.MWO is amazingly a Free-to-Play game. Yes there are many things a player can spend their money on, camos, warhorns, special mech types, BUT unlike WoT, Hawken and other F2P (pay-to-win) models, buying a specialty mech rarely affects actual performance on the battlefield. The MWO devs have done a spectacular job balancing this game. The specialty mechs do appear on the battlefield, and they perform generally well, but rarely will they outperform a variant chassis with a good build. MWO is one of those game it is easy to jump into walk around in your mech and shoot at other mechs.... that's easy. Performing at a high level requires practice and good judgement on the player's part. This is a great game and although I'm not great at it, I am getting better.  "

												I keep reading this is a game that has a steep learning curve...Briefly, you are inside a building tall robot, with 1 to 5 sets of weapons, you fire them at the group of 3 - 5 enemy mechs that seem to want to kill YOU first than the rest of your team...There are several ways to play it, but there are no classes, its your speed, choice of weapons and your team behaviour that determines what you'll be that game.Customizing your mech will take your time but not at first, take one of the trial mechs, I recommend a ""Heavy"" for decent armor and firepower.Despite the flaws, there are some things that make this a different game. No other ""fps"" moves like this, torso and legs are independent, the speeds, the vision angle limits, the arms range, everything matters. The weapons feel good and you can for example have an arm destroyed, or a leg and still carry on fighting as long as the Center Torso is intact and you can walk.As a game engine (graphics/gameplay) its awesome, how it plays and also the visuals. It is demanding and seems to be getting more, you might need a powerfull PC to run medium/high.Finally, MWO has a very decent player base so you'll get in a game fast by clicking quickplay and can try against other starting Tier 5 players. In the end spending money might give you a little advantage but you still need to know how to make it count. It's mostly for cosmetics.--			"

												You now all that ******* grinding and invisbily tank/ship crap from Armored Warfare, World Of Tanks, and World Of Warships?   Well none of that crap. ALL non premium mechs are available for in game currency to ALL players, premium mechs are balanced ot where they only carry different load outs and aren't really pay to win or carry troll guns/armor due to the customization in the gameNo mandatory premium since you don't pay for ammo replenishment or repairs every matchYour first 25 games and achievements make a lot of bonus XP/GXP/C-Bills(money) allowing you to buy any two mechs you want just about OR  one mech and a hell of a lot of equipment for itThe 'end game content' offers easy to get free mech bays (garage slots) so you don't need to spend a bunch of money on them. Also the things you can spend money on in bundles and such are MUCH better in this game than in competitors, A month of premium time and 3 chassis (with all the equipment involved) for 17-45$ or so,  compared to the 50$ for one ship and a bunch of gold for experience converting while you grind the ship or tank till you're miserable and bored playing the same vehicle over and over and over.   Meanwhile I take my mech out with a different weapos and equipment load out every other match.			"

												Fun gameplay and one of the better online communities. The latter being what kept me playing. I've started to play many PvP games online both on PC and the consoles I owned pre PC. Rasict pre-teens telling you they banged your mom reduces fun levels for me. The MWO community however, floods its text chat with friendly greeting and ""GL HF"" before almost every match, and only a few times have I muted players (some of those were just me being a grump and not wanting to listen to people being silly and having fun). If you like Mech gameplay and the customization that should go with it grab this game. It's free to start (trial mechs do the job nicely) and if you're patient you can earn in game currency to buy almost every mech anyways.			"

												Faithful recreation of the tabletop game? Probably not....but as close as you can get in a massive multiplayer arena?Absolutely.  Granted PGI does everything they can to entice you to spend real money, but MWO is a great time if you get off work and just want to climb into the cockpit of a 80 ton robot with giant cannons and laser beams. Oh, and missiles, did I mention drone boats?Yes, I didddddddd.Weapons systems are a bit off from the tabletop (ESP. EW, ie ECM / Beagle / NARC)  due to playerwhine, but ultimately it's all here, save a Long Tom (I suspect that's not long in the coming). Perks truly make each varient of the mech chassis unique and weapons oriented, so you can load up that Mauler with PPC's and the correct varient will SHINE. Best played with a team. Lance. Company, whatever you can get - but if you go PuG you're likely to get a bit...disappointed as the team skill ration isn't very high. However, there are a BUNCH of high quality Merc Corporations you can join to get the full feel and training if you so choose.			"

												I've been playing this game since Beta. It has come a long way since then. It is a smaller development team than I would like for such a large title and cult following, but they are doing a fine job considering. And they've been doing MUCH better since they split from their Publishers (IGP). If you love BattleTech and want to try out driving your own customized Big Stompy Robots against a Team of enemy players, then give this game a try! If you've never heard of BattleTech but you like the idea of Giant Robots that drive and fight similar to Tanks, give this game a try! They have been constantly tweaking their matchmaking system to give as fair as possible games to everyone. Of course, with any matchmaking system, the more players the better the matchmaking will be! Tell your friends to give this game a shot. It has a lot of re-playability and hundreds of different mechs to collect and customize.			"

												MWO is unique in the world of modern games, the F2P model is solid (though I find the prices a little high, you are not forced to buy anything to be competitive).  It's definitely more of a sim than a shooter, heat management and trigger discipline net you more kills than charging in with guns blazing.  A couple things you should know before you drop in:1. Stay with the team - A solo 'Mech gets scrapped in short order, always.2. Press 'R' befpre you start shooting at something - Your target lock is shared with all other players on the team, by letting us know what you're shooting, you might get some assistance befor you get scrapped.3. Trigger Discipline (this is NOT CoD with robots) - As you fire weapons, your 'Mech begins to heat up, keeping an eye on your heat gauge and knowing how much heat your weapons generate per shot is vital to your success.  If you overheat, your 'Mech shuts down until heat levels are within spec again, leaving you an immobile target in the middle of a battlefield.4. Jump into VoIP!  - MWO is a game that heavily emphasises teamwork, grab a headset and coordinate.  Even if you don't have a strategy, you can call out targets that are too far away to target lock, and you can call for help if you get ambushed.  The difference between winners and losers is coordination.5. Read up! - MWO has some great guides available to help the new MechWarrior in understanding his place on the battlefield, read some of them (Google is your friend) to get a leg up on the competition.

												I have not played that many hours via steam, but have played extensively through the direct play client, so don't let my lack of hours play time on steam fool you.Mechwarrior Online, at an initial glance, seems to be a continuation of the Battletech franchise. After all, that's what it bills itself as. However, when you take a close look at the game, what it really boils down to is a giant robot combat sim that borrows some names from the B-Tech universe and some very basic mech designs. Using the Inner Sphere vs. Clan theme, there are supposed to be two technology types. In all previous renditions of the game (including table top), Clan was always superior tech wise. However, thanks to the very venomous and rabid community, PGI has decided to nerf Clan back into the stone age and buff IS way beyond what it should be. Clan is now ultra fragile technology while IS has become the tankiest of the bunch. PGI has tried to reason this away in an attempt to appease the crybabies of the community instead of making other changes that could have addressed this in better ways.To top it off, most of the player base is very toxic. The most vocal of these are those who prefer to meta a game to death and look down their noses at anyone who doesn't play according to their ideas of how it should be done. If you post something on the forums that these self appointed ""elites"" disagree with, they'll let you have both sawed off barrels. In game, if you make a mistake, take a loadout they don't like or anythine else, you'll get verbal abuse like you can't imagine. The moderators are not much of a help either.As someone who has been playing  Battletech since the late '80's, I'm very distraught over the direction MWO has gone. If you're a die hard fan of the universe, a lover of the lore and everything that made Battletech great, stay away from this game - especially if your allegiance is to any of the Clans. If you are a lover of generic giant robot combat sims, someone who doesn't give a care about the B-Tech universe, is someone who only wants to meta a game to death, and is someone who has a very toxic personality, then this game is for you. I'm done with this b a sta rdization of a once great gaming system. I'm so disgusted with PGI now that I won't even purchse their Mechwarrior 5 release due out in 2018. They haven't done anything to earn another cent from me.------------------I just posted the following on my unit's message board. This is how bad it's gotten for me...Over the past week, I've found that I haven't really been playing too much. I haven't been able to nail down why until today's patch and my reflections upon it.I haven't been having fun any more. It began with the nerfing of my favorite mech, the Kodiak. Then PGI decided to nerf the hell out of Clan tech. In addition to that, they mismatched the weight in faction play between the two sides. The Stormcrow (whom right before the nerf I spent $20 to get the Jade Falcon camo) was no longer able to be used for scouting. So, the Kodiak package and the storm crow camo were both things I spent money on which became basically useless. That was wasted money down the drain.Then PGI went on to nerf Clan missiles and autocannons. SRMs generate a ton more heat, ballistics do too as well as an increased chance of jamming on the ultras. That ruined a lot of favorite configurations that I had. Having a mech with a single UAC was basically useless. When I tried to address this on the forums, I got nothing back but venom from the forum regulars. This opened my ears to the truly venomous player community and what happens during drops - how the other players' attitudes are.I used to love faction play, but now I hate it every time I play it.Then PGI continued to ignore Battletech lore, starting earlier in 2016 with setting up the Mercenary loyalty (Clans hiring mercs? What?).Now PGI has struck again with more nerfs to Clan while continuing to buff the Inner Sphere.I just don't have it in me any more to play this game. It's no longer fun. I've wasted money on mechs and patterns. I still have 30 days of premium time waiting to be activated due to all the money I've spent and time banked up. But I don't even have the desire to use that any more. If this was a game where I paid a one time fee of $40, then... I dunno. But I've spent a heck of a lot more than that in this ""Free to play"" game. It's just not worth my time or money any more because I no longer have any fun.This is why I haven't been playing much, and this is why I won't be playing for a while, if ever again.You guys are my friends and I've really enjoyed getting to know you. I'm very sorry.			"

												I was sceptical at first with it being ftp and the usual expectation of p2w. thankfully my wealthy friend came along and proved i had nothing to worry about. having all the mechs doesnt mean you have an advantage. There is a higher then normal skill cap i would say, the way the skill lvls are tiered means if you are not great like me, you are against equally as bad people.Really fun team play either in quickplay or faction, oddly nice community for the internet, oh and 07 is a salute.. it took me a while to find out.Wanted to add, even though it is free to play they put events on pretty much every weekend, that give you access to alot of the cosmetic items that you usually have to pay for (skins etc)Some people seem to moan alot about LRM mechs, its down to the lights and quicker mediums to get round and deal with them before they become a problem. with alot of new people playing this seems to be happening less. Alas it will get better, or if you cant beat them join them, its actually fun >:)			"

												A totally solid Mechwarrior game.  While it does have issues such as a limited number of maps and game modes, it is clear that the developers want to expand the game greatly in terms of content and game experience.  There is already robust support for multiple playstyles.The need to balance player experience with sellable content is obvious in a F2P game, and I feel the developers are making a fair and earnest effort to provide a great game for those on a budget while offering the big spender ways to part with their money without completely breaking the balance of the game.All in all, the game art is beautiful and the game tries to adhere to Battletech lore insofar as is possible, so fans of ""armored combat"" style shooters and Battletech fans alike should all be able to find something that keeps them coming back.

												I have to recomend this game (sigh)I have been playing it for about 3 years now. If I didnt recomend this game, I would feel bad for the last 3 years :PPro'sThe mech's look amazing, and allot of the graphics are pritty goodPGI has really stepped up their game in map design, and allot of the new maps have depth.The difference in playstyles of each mec can be vastly different, be it light, med, heavy, or assault. Not all mechs are viable but allot of them are, so there isnt one or two mech's that are the best.If you get onto a decent team, you will have alot of fun, dosnt matter if you want to do compeditive or just tool around in community warfare.If you played WoT(World of Tanks) you will have a one up in this game being that they are very close in play style and form.Cons:The hitreg varies between the different weapons and is infuriating. Some times your damage numbers reflect exactly the work you put in, then other times it dosnt and then some time you get no hitreg and you dont even effect you target by shooting him/her...it. It is theorized that if you can have a ping of 120 consitantly you are in the sweet spot and your hitreg will be perfect, and that if you have a stable ping that dosnt vary allot, it will be even better.The balancing of the game by PGI is real, they over balence them to try and make every weapon viable and nerf mechs just to make them less usefull, instead of realizing that they are only balancing the game into frustration. The new player experience is very difficult. Most of us have been playing for several years, as such we have become really good at the game, figured out what mechs we are good at and are up on the current meta. new players arnt, and often get frustrated because the biggest and baddest mechs arnt nessessarly the best. once they figure that out, most of them have already sunk allot of cbills into bad mechs. Also the learning curve can be brutal and unforgiving, between knowing where to go on the map, to just maneuvering around in your mech. Sticky walls that break your legs, and small rocks that keep your 100 ton mec from moving are just some of the frustrating things that can run you away from this game. It dosnt happen as often as it used to, but it still happens.Finnaly the community, this community is the most loyal, and at the same time can be the most hateful. There have been and are allot to trolls, at the same time, a game can be won and lost by one person doing somthing really stupid. This is a team game, not a single player game, and is much more unforgiving than all other shooters. Your teamates rely on you not doing stupid things and staying with the team. "

												Played this game quite a bit since 2013. I really do like it. It is not a perfect game, but it is pretty good fun. While it may seem kind of expensive for some 'mechs, the truth is you can use the free 'mechs you get and still do very well. The only real thing you would want to buy is more slots for 'mechs. The devs make consistent updates to the game every 2 weeks on Tuesday, usually consisting of balance tweaks and bugfixes. We are supposed to be getting a fairly large addition of content in the form of a ""Phase III"" for the Community Warfare aspect of the game in the near future. There are new 'mechs added regularly, and they have been doing a pretty good job recently of making them moderately balanced against each other.As far as the grind goes, it recently got much better. The in-game currency earn rate was increased by a pretty significant amount, which means less time spent to buy a new 'mech. There are also very regular events during the weekend where you can get a good chunk of premium and in-game currency, and somtimes even new 'mechs or mechbays. This game looks pretty good graphically, though if you look too close some of the textures are a bit low res. It is running in Cryengine, so the optimization is iffy at times. You may need a pretty good machine to run with all the bells and whistles, and even then probably won't want to run things like particles too high, as that can cause FPS dips. The 'mechs are mostly well modeled, and look good. There is the occasional low res texture on a 'mech, however.PROS:-Can do good as a pure F2P player-Grind is not so bad anymore-Core Gameplay is pretty solid-Constant in-game eventsNEUTRAL-Need to spend money on mechbays in order to build up a large stable of custom 'mechs-Pretty steep learning curveCONS-Runs a little bad on older machines-Not too much mode variety currently-Textures bad in some spots			"

Pro's- Great Gameplay - Extremely satisfying combat- Easy to pick up controls and get strait into the fighing but extremely hard to Master a Mech and become an Ace pilot (Pick a Mech and carve out your own Piloting Style)- Fantastic sense of developing your armoury and customizing Mechs to suit your Play style- Great replayability and sense of earning/time invested for tangible rewards- Regular Community wide tournaments and events which reward all players with real money purchasable items from the store (cosmetic colours and commos/Mech Bays/War horns/Cockpit Items/Free Mechs etc.|)  - Can play this game Free2Play, there is no Pay2Win except temporary pay walls when new Mechs are released- Teamspeak address known as Comstar to find players to play with or clans to join mwo.syn-games.com or na1.mech-connect.net- Doesnt need a high-spec machine to run. Those two videos were filmed on low settings on a low-med spec computer.- Cadet bonus and tutorial give new players a good chunk of the in game currency allowing them to kit out any Mech of their choice to start earning some C-Bills

Con's- Dev's who often apear to have no understanding or experience playing the game- Some really bad maps - Forest Colony, River City and Caustic Valley (ironically these maps used to be fine but the dev's tried to improve them)- Quite a grind before you have any decent variety of Mech's- Conquest and Assault both are lacking as game modes leaving skirmish as by far the more popular- One of the most toxic gaming communities around although i personally enjoy this as it means you get raged at regularly by the feeble opposition you just slaughtered single handedly. However most of the abuse will come from critical members of your own team. This similarly is a source of entertainment for me. If you are dead and i am alive your criticism means nothing! - Did i mention how bad the Devs can be? If you want a game that you can play regularly on your own or with friends that includes big stompy robots blasting bits off each other then look no further. Combat that stays satisfying after the 1000th time you have walked over the vanquished corpses of your enemies and shot a 100 ton Mech that towers over you in the♥♥♥♥♥with all your weapons and watched him topple like a giant tree to come crashing down at your feet.

												Let's start simple. Try the game for yourself. I can only tell you that my experience with this game since 2012 has been good. That is my experience alone but you can make up your mind by trying it yourself.Play the 25 matches for the in game currency to see if you truly like the game or not._______Let's break this down into several components. Gameplay, UI, Graphics, Content, End Game.Gameplay 8/10:This game down to its core is a very fun game when you play it and learn it. Its an action shooter but it doesn't have the cartoon speed of some other FPS where you die after stubbing your toe on a bullet. No you can take a hit and if you are smart can survive for as long as you can. There's a sense of tactics in there somewhere. It's knowing when to attack, when to retreat, when to work with your team. You don't just run and gun and respawn.That is just half the game to launch into a match though. The second half is to make and create your own mech builds. To be able to tinker and change a chassis to how you want to play and not some stock loadout. To own and change every mech that you can get. To collect and master all the mechs you want provided you get the mechbays you need.It isn't perfect, balance could be better in regards to lesser used weapons. There could be more balance between the two major 'Factions' the Clans and the Inner Sphere.Overall it feels like a fun game to play,UI 7/10:The first incarnation was terrible, the second incarnation horrific, and now we have this current '2.5' UI that has honestly been a success. There's a lot of clicking but in comparison to other games like say Armoured Warfare it isn't actually as bad as it use to be. A lot of information that needs to be presented to you is but there is room for improvement which will come.What the game needs? UI Tooltips when you work in the Mechlab. UI for Mech Modules (Extra addons for mechs), and just quality of life improvements.Overall the UI is not special but its not terrible.Graphics 8/10:Mechwarrior: Online is showing its age. It runs on a outdated engine that has high demands for less gains. We've seen the power and scale of CryEngine 3 as a FPS but it demands much more when you see 12 vs 12 Giant mechs that take up a lot more power to render. The graphics are however still quite amazing. The visuals of seeing your lasers, cannons, and missiles fire is amazing. You won't be disappointed by all the effects.However you would want optimizations out of this game. It definitely needs to be optimized across the board.Overall its a great visual overall but it isn't the type of visuals you would expect from some triple AAA title which you shouldn't anyways.Content 8/10:In my opinion the story is not rich but the lore behind it is. It leads into having a lot of room for content in the future. It already has hundreds of mechs to choose from which is the meat of the content. There's so much room for variety that it provides so much content already. Could it have more than just mechs? Yes.I want to see more than just PvP Matches. It lacks in content that isn't just PvP.Overall its still good but that leads into the last component.End Game 5/10:The end game is unfinished. Plain and Simple it is not done. It is an interesting Idea of a moving world but it just seems like a map and place to fight right now.The future looks bright for it with new modes of play, the ability to use guild/faction/unit money to buy things with but its not there yet._________Overall this game is 7.5/10 until more patches come out. I have some faith but it needs to be proven at this point.			"

												This game is the worst piece of trash game i've ever had the missfortune playing and actually be intrested in.If you are new and want to check if it is worth playing, no it is not. The game doesn't teach you anything and actively spites you for giving it a try. Let's get this straight:the client - let me quickly mention that it crashes all the time and then get to the REALLY BAD things about it. Like it having to load all the ****ing time. Did you crash to desktop or just got dc'ed again ? Thank god PGI frontloads their advertisement and newsfeed. Once this is loaded your mechs need to laod in, all while you impatiently just want to get back into the game. finaly everything is loaded. Let's just click ""rejoin"" and suddenly the pgi manager comes screaming into your room saying that that would be WAY TO CONVENIENT, better remove that and make it unneccessary complicated.Finished a match and won something, enjoy your loading times!Lost a match and just want to play with another mech, loading times!And no i'm not complaining about that there ARE loading times, i am complaining of how long they are and how they are staged. You know how in World of Tanks it takes less than 30 seconds to exit a match and get into another one, yeah that's a good standart to measure against.the UI - utter trash and most of all, useless in conveying information, want to skill up one of your mechs? well have fun clicking yourself through one of the most annoying and convoluded interfaces designed to this date. want just to ""quickly"" upgrade a weapon have fun finding it!I think the ui is best described with this, there are three buttons that all have the same function! GENIOUSThe gameplay - well it's 12 vs 12 battlearena gameplay what possible is there to mess that up ? - was the question PGI set out to answer when they decided to develope this tragedy.Hint: they f***ing nailed answering that question.So let's see how they accomplished this from the ground up:You know how in good games multiplayer maps allow for a certain kind of flow?Where there seems to be the right amount of cover so you just barely can make it.Open fields that are just long enough that you dare sprinting across themBottlenecks to funnel your enemies into and always corners to retreat to?Yes?Good, because this game has none of those elements, map design apparently was amateur hour.Long streches of nothing and more nothing then suddenly cliffs that all funnel everyone to that one ramp from where you emerge into a city, djungel or what ever random scenario they came up with next.But hey those are just the maps your first players and new users get in contact with, i mean it could be worse, they could play one of the braindead factionplay maps. Implying that new users even are able to play in this mode in the first place. Since you couldn't just let me pick a house i want to fight for better make this too overly complicated by needing to sign contracts, create units and clans. No the faction play maps are the worst from floating objects and assetts, over invisble walls and horrible hitboxes that block your shots in mid air or making a casual walk out of bounds while heading straight torwards the objective, because reasons. Yeah, slopeing the out of bounds inwards makes total sense. no really. And let's not forget the respawn points for both teams, undefended & unproteced open to everyone but hey if they design it like this you can surely pick different drop zones, have many ways to run to cover, right?So how is the weapon/ mech balance?Well let's put it like this, if you are cool with selling all your favorite mechs in favor of the NEW & SHINEY and SOOO MUCH COOLER mech PGI promotoes this month then yes you can play always with a well balanced and most devinetly not overpowered mech. But, let's cut some slack, if LoL can get away with this kind of design while raking in millions, PGI has just as much right, no not right! A CALLING, to do so too.I hope you also like either reading patchlogs and crunshing numbers or you might as well guess which weapons currently are best. Why not play a few matches with different systems to find out? well it seems that blasting for minutes at that assault isn't working out. You barely made a dent in his backarmor when you suddenly exploded into a violent burst of nuclear fire. because now you can read that,.... well that you died of engine failure and isn't that what is really necessary to know?And last let's talk about who you are playing with.I have NEVER met a bunch of more desperate, friendly and borderline psychotic people in my life. Let me explain this:These people are so desperate for a good mech based battle game that they are openly welcoming everyone who is willing to play with them they know that this game lives on each player because the fewer players there are the lower the chances for PGI to still turn a profit.But if you DARE to speak out, point out obvious design flaws they flip their crazy button, ""the game couldn't possible be bad! you just suck at playing!"" ""no everything is perfect they just played better in team like when that one guy came torwards the three of us facetanking everything and then just blow us up, you just don't realise that yet.""These players, players in general deserve better. But noone is demanding it because they are either not into gamedesign or just want to be happy to have at least some mech game.If you play in faction warfare the whole thing reverts, you find clans and groups that will actively stall games to maximise their rewards, you will encounter people camping your respawn or just walzing in there and farming your mechs while you can do nothing.Well i am not happy anymore, the straw that broke the camels back was today when the entirety of clan -MS- decided to walk into the dropzone of the map and start respawnkilling and on my remark that this is bullsh*t, someone replied ""we deserve to be respawnkilled here."" Well i don't think so, and any course on basic game design would support that.It's not even that they were respawn killing without repercussions except some slight dropship turret dmg, it's that PGI and the way rewards are given in this game actively encourages this behaviour. It's a disgusting thing to encourage in people and brings out only the worst. And most of all it would be easy to fix.UT 2003 had short invincibity for respawned player and a canon at the spawn points that would one shot anyone walking into the entrance.Rtcw: ET had a freaking mortar that could be aimed at the enemy respawn point and again, short invincibility for respawning players, choice of different spawn locations and several exit points for each of these spawns.But hey you could fix it much easier reward extra points for remaining time that outweight the points killing give - ♥♥♥♥ like this you could also give the defenders points for enemy time wasted making that despereate light mech push that much more rewarding.Or how about negative feedback, punish killing in the respawn zone or just make it simply - pointless, Or some positive reinforcment, award more points for killing pilots that have done more damage and 0 if they just respawned.The possible solutions are endless, some of the implementations really simpel, but PGI does none of them and this community still defends this behaviour. And this is just one of the countless problems this game has.I don't care anymore, i won't waste any more time of what little i have left, with a game that does so much wrong and yet gets defended by a community that has developed severe stockholm syndrome.Can't recommend this game, not at all.

												I've played this game heavily since closed beta (2012). It is one of the few f2p games that I've been consistently playing. I will admit I have heavy bias on this game as I am a mechwarrior franchise fan, but I would recommend any prior mechwarrior series player to give it a try.Good:Great mech combat.Great visuals and art.Grind is much better than most f2p games.Best mechs are all free.Bad:New mechs are paywalled for a few months.Limited game modes.Slow balance changes.Heavy learning curve.

												Not an easy game.Controls are tricky at first, as in difficult to get used to immediately, but, not impossible. But, extreme amounts of customization! Very well made game overall. Like mecha combat? This is it. Probably the best free to play mecha game I've played so far. I mostly play a lot of World of Tanks, and this definitely caught my attention.Although, I'll admit, I still suck at mechwarrior, I'm still learning.If you think something like Robocraft's gameplay sucked♥♥♥♥♥ try Mechwarrior. Put away the legos, and get into a mech. Strategy, weapons, mech loadout, etc will take you some time to learn. But this is a very excellent game. Very well made.Highly reccomended.			"

												I hate to give this game a thumbs down since I'm not a fan of Mech Warrior and only played it once before, but as someone who comes from Armored Core 4 and below and LOVE mechs, this game feels extremely slow, it's more like a tank game rather than a mech game. This is a shame since Mech Games have all but completely disappeared and the only ones left are indistinguishable from piloting tanks.If You like Mech Warrior this game looks solid but It doesn't seem to have a lot of content and the prices for some Mechs ""Performance Packs"" are downright stupid! 50$ for a mech??? No thanksIf you like fast paced action, proving yourself as a pilot and a dog fighter, this game is definitely not for you. If you like slow methodological games then give it a try, you may like it.			"

												Mechwarrior Online is a worthy followup to its legendary predecessors, and the best large robot tactical action game on the market. It hits the rarely achieved sweet spot between first-person twitch gameplay and methodical strategy, combining extremely deep customization of beautifully brutal war machines with intense moment-to-moment combat. The pace of battle is somewhat less than the warp speed found in most first person shooters, allowing the player's tactical awareness and strategic creativity to come to the fore, in contrast to other games where raw reaction speed is king. This more thoughtful pacing is consistent with the game's stylistic choices as well, which hew to a more traditionally ""western"" aesthetic of plausible tank-like distopian death machines stomping across war torn cityscapes and dangerous alien worlds, in contrast to the glut of ""Japanese"" style lithe robots that dance across most videogames today.  The game's free-to-play economy has gone through various permutations before appearing here on steam, but has settled into a comfortable place, providing adequate resources to free players in normal play, along with increasingly generous special event prizes most weekends that prevent any ""pay to win"" problems. Additionally, they have reduced ""XP"" requirements to narrow the gap between old-hands and neophytes, making this the best time for a new player to enter the arena since it's original closed beta launch. While the enormous variety of potential player customization makes balance devilishly tricky, the developers have consistently improved it over time, and managed to move it to a remarkably tight band that permits significant variety of viable playstyles. In sum, I give this game my highest endorsement, I have been playing it since closed beta and it is undoubtedly the strongest it has ever been.			"

												Great Mech game. Endless customization, great immersive feel...you really feel like you're there, piloting a Mech.  The controls are almost as complicated as getting acquainted with the game systems and HUD, but a decent tutorial and remapping keybinds makes it easy to get into this game and on your way after the first hour...but mastery would take hundreds of hours. The combat is great. the graphics have held up beautifully. Game is gorgeous. Lots of maps and play modes. Gripes: The menus are pretty bad and there are many things, such as simply changing the basic color of your mech, or worse, elite consumables, that you won't get unless you pay big bucks. You even get ""crates"" with potentially good stuff, but have to pay for ""keys"" to unlock said crates. I get it, its a store model, but games like LOL do it best, where 95% of the game is available to you for free, it'll just take more time.Overall, this is a great AAA quality game with dozens of hours of fun for free.

												I want to start off my being clear that I'm a returning founder who left the game initially because of problems with balance, meta, and PGI's inability to deliver.I picked the game back up again about a month ago, figuring i'd get in, check out CW, and lose interest within a day or two.  And to be honest, i still feel like i could lose interest any time now.For better or worse, this is not a direct port of TT.  To be hoenst TT had some mechanics in it that were just not suited to real time simulation.  PROSThe mech models are really good.  There are some technical issues with some models (hit boxes, scaling), but i think that on the whole, the mech models are in good shape.We got the Unseen showing up.  While the mech modles are altered, they are still immediately recognizeable.Most of the weapon and component implementations make sense when ported over from TTCommunity is generally less toxic than most others (That said, this is a team-based game and people do ge frustrated when people ignore attempts to organize in match)The number of mechs now available makes it less likey that during drops (at least in the lower 3 tiers) you will encounter  cookie-cutter meta teams.CONSBallistic weapons aer still just a hair to accurate.  While rounds drop in flight, they don't really seem to deviate in any other way.  Some of the weapon conversions are just badly implemented:  A 5 second cool down on gauss rifles, then charge time before you can fire, which really adds up to a double-lencgth cooldownClan implementation was just baddly handled, and it still causes gameplay and balance problemsGameplay/Mech balance issues can take some time resolve, and are sometimes knee-jerk reactions (Ask a veteran about tackling)Community Warfare just isn't ready yet.All in all, despite having some issues, the game does have promise, and is fun most of the time.  There are some changes coming up in the immediate future that address some of the outstanding issue and open up more content for Community Warfare.  So with all of that, for now, yes, I'd reccomend it, because you can get damn near everything out of the game without spending any money, though obviously people who spend the money get access to new chasis sooner.

												As a fan of any game that has big, heavy and powerful mechs to pilot I could already recommend at least playing this game for free. It starts you off with four ""Trial Mechs"" for each weight-class of mech. You have Light, Medium, Heavy and Assault mechs to try out with rather optimized loadouts, but on the whole they'll be suited towards default playstyle rather than individual tastes. The game's intro academy run and tutorial is very nice and simple, it even gives out some free in-game currency (C-Bills), and for the first twenty matches you drop into you get cash injections. By the end of the twenty matches you WILL have enough to buy your own mech to fully customize.For those who want to drop cash on a starter kit? I'd recommend it, though I also recommend looking at the website for the developer, ""MWO Mercs"". It has active bundles for specific mechs, iconic mechs, pre-order packs and ""al a carte"" style purchasing to pick and choose. It is a bit of an advantage over other players earning mechs via hard fighting, though trial mechs also build XP for those buying that variant. All in all, the game is fun. There's many ways to play and be a credit to your team, and this isn't even touching upon Community Warfare which introduces more organized combat that offers rewards such as in-game items for decoration and ""real money"" Mech-Credits to buy custom colors and such with.In the end, it isn't Gundam, it plays heavier and slower for most mech pilots. You're in anything from a 20-ton Locust with high-speed capabilities to a 100-ton Atlas that can literally bludgeon through enemy lines to open up holes for the team.I recommend this game, while it might not be for everyone, it's definitely a ""Freemium""/Free to Play title that is worth trying.

												Pros- Beautifully designed Mechs by Alex Iglesias (the man is a god)- Not a twitch shooter. Needs map awareness and thinking to play well.- Kit out your mech- Play as a team or lose.Cons- Developer has no clue about game mode mechanics- Developer has no clue about map design- Developer has no clue how to optimise a game engine (DX9 runs better than DX11 here)- The game will never be finished. Developer is constantly fiddling around with it.- Faction Play (Community Warfare) is a bust- Conquest modeHaving played this for 2-3 years since before Steam release. I have to warn you that the learning curve is fairly steep. There are a lot of things to know about the game, and they will not come quickly.Most of the guys who have stuck around are hardcore Battletech/Mechwarrior fans who just want to pilot their favourite mechs into battle and blow up other mechs.The core gameplay loop is improving how fast you blow up the other guy with well placed shots. But the game modes are standard. Skirmish, Assault, Domination are all just Deathmatches with some twist or none. I personally hate Conquest mode because it simply doesn't work without respawn mechanics.A lot of this review sounds negative, and that is intended. I would recommend this game, but ONLY if you like the few things it does right, and if you like beautiful mechs.			"

												Its not bad.If you're looking for a modern day Mech Warrior game, this is a pretty good fit.  The game play seems to blend the best part of MW3 and MW4 together, while at the same time eliminating some of the most annoying parts of each.  Gone are the laser bunnies that dominated MW3.  Gone are the crippling customization limitations that made MW4 bad.  While you don't have complete freedom, the game gives you enough to capture a good experience - if you're willing to grind for it.The C-bill grind wall is pretty massive after the first 25 games.   You cant just jump in your mech of choice as in past games, you instead have to buy it and you'll farm for quite sometime just to gear out a good sized mech the way you want it.  This kind of sucks.  The games microtransation system is not required at all, but is also not very generous.  If you do want to support the game, be prepared to pay 20$ just for 1 medium sized mech.All and all, if you're looking for some old fashion mech action, this game is good.  Just make sure to buy the mech you want in the beginning, otherwise it's going to be a long time until you get it.			"

												Title: Mechwarrior Online (MWO)Platform: PCGenre: MMOFPS (kinda), Its currently restricted to 12 v 12 pvp.Non-Spoiler Opinion: Since there aren’t really spoilers I will post my general opinion here and in the spoiler section give my tips to playing the game effectively.Pros: Balance seems relatively good however I prefer the Clan mechs over the Inter Sphere mechs because of the omnipod system. I have heard people argue Clan vs IS supremacy but I have seen relatively good balance on both sides. IS gets more quirks (bonuses for specific things) and Clans can swap out omnipods for greater customization. Player skill seems to make up for many things but nothing beats good team work in this game. It really doesn’t seem like a tank combat game as a light mech, its more like sniping or fast pace brawling game depending on build. The heavist mechs (assault class) do act rather tank-like and the balance of speed vs damage is quite good.Cons: This game appears to have some glitching issues. There is quite a benefit to people who pay money to get a hero or variant mech by giving a 30% C-bill bonus from each match. Of course, it is more cost efficient to at the very least learn to play and find which mech you like the most before you spend money on a hero mech.Overall Rating: 8/10*SPOILERS*Story Arc: None.Opinion in full: (my favorite builds) Light mech- Arctic Cheetah (you will need to buy omnipods for arms)ECM,6 - Small Pulse Lasers. How you want to play this build is to flank the enemy and pick off any mechs that break off from the rest of the group.Medium mech- Shadowcat B-variant ECM, 2 ER-PPC. You will want to snipe with this build and use the MASC ability in short burst to assist you in evading enemy fire. Heavy mech- Hellbringer 4 medium lasers, ECM, LBX AC 20 (shotgun autocannon), lots of ammo for the LBX. This is a strong brawler heavy mech with high damage output, just watch out for overheating if you fire the lasers too much. "

												As a long time Battletech and Mechwarrior fan i've been in love with this game for a couple of years now(ignore the playtime, got 100's of hours in it before it came to steam). Its F2P so you got nothing to lose trying it out. Never spent a penny myself so far but do intend to for some paint jobs and maybe a hero mech or two and also to support the developers who i think deserve it for producing a game i've had so much fun with.Excellent game!P.S Dont give up if you keep getting destroyed all the time when you first start, Its a steep learning curve which makes it all the more sweet when you start getting better at it.

												I read a number of positive & negative reviews before writing my outstandingly positive review of MechWarrior Online!The anger I saw from the community of 3+ years ago and from the founding members about some of the problems with changes the developer made are just nonexistent in the game today.  I also feel the community back then was mostly just upset about changes that weren’t fair at the time but have been fixed from the game I play today.  So, don't let any of those reviews deter you from trying this fantastic game.MechWarrior Online is free, worth a bit of your time to try out, and if you enjoy playing it grab a few Mechs to support the continued development of the game, and if not, you paid nothing!The game I found is very competitive, fun, and nothing short of amazing.PS: Use the “Dakka” Dire Wolf mech seen on the “Metamechs” mech building website; it has been my favorite so far!  Anyway, no more time to write, there are enemy mechs that need a good Dakka!Enjoy, Have Fun!			"

												For fans of the Mechwarrior series, this is the online competitive version we've been waiting for. It certainly lives up to the previous titles. It isn't 100% perfect, but I think the positives certainly make up for the faults and the dev team is actively working on the game and improving on it. They also listen to and interact with the community pretty regularly through podcasts and town halls.The most important part is the mechs in a game like this, and in that regard they've done quite well. There is a huge variety of mechs of all sizes from 20 ton lights to 100 ton behemoth assaults and everything in between. Each mech has multiple variants with different hardpoints and options so it's easy to find something to fit your playstyle. They're also operating on a monthly release schedule which sees a new mech released mid-month every month. Initially mechs are sold in packs for real money but become available for in-game currency shortly after, so paying players effectively get the first crack at the new mechs.Maps could use some work. The maps themselves are great, well designed, look nice, and have pretty good diversity. The problem is they could stand to add another 4 to 6 maps to the game as currently I believe there's only around 10 or so for quick play.The gameplay is a nice mix of FPS and vehicular combat. While it does operate like an FPS in a sense, you are in giant robots and they do act like giant robots. Once queued and a match is found players are presented with a vote screen to vote for map/mode, which is something I wish other games like this would offer (looking at you War Thunder). The matches themselves are 12v12's and each player has the one mech they dropped with and that's it. There's no respawn, there's no heals, and no second chances; so play smart. This is probably the part of the game that can be frustrating for new players, but I think once you get past the punishing nature of the game you start to prefer it the way it is.One of the games current negatives is its faction warfare system. This is meant to be a sort of faction versus faction warfare system and is supposed to be more competitive. Unfortunately it's just not very active as the majority of the players still just play in the standard play queue and the motivation to play in the faction system is really rather lacking. It's a good idea, I just think the scope of it is too great for the limited appeal, particularly in a more niche game like this.One of the games best parts is the mechlab where you can customize your rig. Decide which weapon combos you want, how many heatsyncs, extra hardware, and so on. Clan and Inner Sphere mechs do operate a little differently in here as IS mechs allow you to modify the engines, while the engines are generally locked in clan mechs. However clan mechs offer the benefit of being able to switch out components with those from other variants which IS mechs can not do. Using your mechbay to upgrade and modify your loadout is extremely key in this game to be able to make the most of your mech and how you play it.The economy of the game is generally done pretty nice. It doesn't take too much to earn the credits in game required to buy a mech unless you're going for the biggest and most expensive clan mech. It really isn't pay-to-win as most of what you purchase using MC's (premium currency) are cosmetics like colors, decals, camo's, and so on. There are hero mechs that are available only for MC's however these mechs don't really provide an advantage, more a c-bill earning bonus while piloting them and a camo that is unique to the hero. I think the biggest hurdle for newer players are the MC costs of some things, particularly mechbays since the number of mechs you can purchase is always limited by how many bays you have available. Colors are another issue as their costs are pretty high and there's only a small selection of maybe 5 basic colors you can buy for c-bills, though once a color is unlocked you can use it on any mech. Camo's may seem expensive at first, but there is a ""one shot"" option that you can use that will apply the camo to your mech and it will remain so long as you don't change the camo later. Buying the camo outright costs 10x the price and really has no value unless you're constantly swapping camo's.The game does almost weekly run events that do allow you to earn MC's just through gameplay, and generally one of these events will net you enough for a mechbay. Prizes also often include things like c-bills, cockpit decor, MC's, and occassionally even colors. The events are very practical unlike some other games that offer event prizes where the requirements to get the prizes is often ridiculous.All-in-all I would say this is a great game that is worth a shot. It offers a lot of gameplay options through mechs of different sizes, speeds and styles and the community is generally pretty decent. I mean, sure you're going to get some jerks now and then, but overall the community is not overly rude or salty. This is particularly valuable given the game does have built-in VOIP for communication in matches, but there is a mute ability if you do run in to the occassional loudmouth you'd rather just not hear. So I would say definitely give the game a shot, particularly if you enjoyed or played previous Mechwarrior games.			"

Then tactics start to get hard when you get to tier 4 as they are the 'above the noob' skill group.Grind?YES YES YESbut the play is fun, if you like ALOT OF TEAM WORK...Bad graphics?Nah, that are decent thanks to cry engine, but sometimes newer rigs lag due to the age of the engine.50-60 on rx480 8gb "

												The game has flaws. It lacks variety in game modes, some maps aren't balanced well enough, some weapons don't work as supposed to like LBX, team work is difficult without proper ingame commands except for chat, Faction wars are pointless at the moment but, damn, this game gives a proper MechWarrior feel.It appreciates team work and tactical movement around the map, flanking and other stuff, it gives you epic moments when staying on top of a close and tough round with a new mech and loadout.Do you need to pay to be able win? Nah, only learning and thinking brings victory. All mechs are available for ingame currency sooner or later except for Heroes and Champions, which are not a must.Do you need to follow the Laser Meta? Not at all, any variety of weapons can work out if you utilize them properly.There is a ton of various loadouts you can come up with for most of the mechs.Stay away from Trials as soon as possible, but they sure helps to take a look at various Mechs.The game gets updated often enough and it's a lot better than it was in 2013 and still getting better.It's great to play this game in a split with Megamek to help visualize the last one. :)240 hours since Steam release and still enjoying it.

												Been playing this game for years before it came to steam. At the time of writing this, It's easily in the best state it's ever been in. If you want to try your hand at a solid mech simulator, pick this up. It's entirely possible to play and do well without spending a dime, all it takes is practice practice practice. Nothing that can be bought with money is any more competetive than what can be bought with in-game currency, it just might net you a little more reward at the end of your matches.That said if the game catches your attention the way it has so many others and you find yourself a true fan, it can be hard not to spend the money to get those shiney mechs with special paint and increased match rewards.

												Great game. PGI has brought it up from what it was (not that it was ever bad in my eyes) They continuosly work on fixes, balancing and any other issues that arise, props to PGI for getting it to where it currently is. Will continue to throw money at them since I'm that happy with what they're achieving for the Mechwarrior fans. GAMEPLAY: The game plays as a slower paced thinking shooter which I find very nice. Making one wrong decision in this game can turn disastrous for you very quickly. If you've ever played a game where you drove a tank that's what this is like in terms of controls. Being able to change Mechs that you own to your style of play allows for near endless combinations (some vastly more effective than others). You can build from Long Range Missiles (LRMs) Short Range Missiles (SRMs), Lasers, Autocannons, Gauss Rifles and you can often pair up many together depending on the Mech you are running. All in all it's a very solid game and can be completely free to play if you choose to go that route and not preorder for early access to Mechs before they are out for C-bills(in game currency). So far I would not say I've run into any particular area of the game where it is pay-to-win only pay-to-early-access.TO ALL NEW PLAYERS: You have nothing to lose and everything to gain by trying this out, it will appear grindy at first, and undoubtedly you will be pulverized by those more experienced than yourself. Remember this though, you'll enjoy every second of seeing that Atlas round the corner and lay into your face with it's massive alpha and in turn you will find yourself striving to learn how to avoid and combat such situations. I look forward to seeing you on the field Mechwarrior.UPDATE: Many new Mechs are available for in game currency compared to when I last revised my review, as well as many upcoming Mechs that will be first available for real money but will come later for in game currency. Some of the included Mechs for in game currency are the Archer, Rifleman, Warhammer, and Marauder. Others on their way that are available for preorder include the Viper (July 19th), Cyclops (Aug. 23rd), Night Gyr (Sep. 20th), Huntsman (Oct. 18th), and my personal favorite the Linebacker (Nov. 15th). All of these dates are for 2016. Many changes have come to how the Faction Play (previously known as Community Warfare) works and all of them are absolutely great in my opinion, there are now scouting missions which will land you bonuses for when you invade etc. As well as changes to the Faction Contracts and Career Choice options. Freelance, Mercenary and Loyalist are the options and all have their bonuses and drawbacks.			"

												Polished mech game definitely woth the download. It feels like a moba with two teams going for objectives or just skirmishing. If you've played World of Tanks this is the same thing with mechas. Earn enough to buy new mechas or upgrade modules. A nice touch is that you can customize your loadout to be a missle, laser, speed, low heat, or ballistic mecha. I can see how this would be a little grindy but its not bad compared to WOT. there is also a good rotation of free mechas every week but you just cant customize those easily.			"

												*Edited: This was before I began getting into the faction (ranked) gameplay. The mode is way more tactical with actual strategizing, that the community often engages in. However, the queues are extremely long, even longer than gameplay somtimes. Here's the rest of the review:I have mixed feelings about this game, but overall I feel it's a pretty fun, semi-tactical combat arena game in the Battlemech universe. I've been looking to play something like Mechwarrior but more recent, and this fits those old games with improved gameplay and graphics.I haven't been huge into the Battlemech universe, so part of the game is overwhelming. There is a lot going on in this game; so many Mechs to choose from, weapons and builds to go with.The community has been pretty solid thusfar. I've only had 1 game where a teammate purposely shot off my arms. I expected more, but everyone seems to either be going along with the gameplay or actively tactical and supportive.The gameplay is very short and can miss a lot of the tactical aspect. The maps are diverse and offer some strategizing, but within the community, the strategy features aren't used often. The same can be said for any gameplay mode that isn't deathmatch; all objectives tend to be to elimate the other team.Some purchase aspects are mainly skins, or things that can be grinded for. So it's not unfairly balanced to those who pay to win. The challenges add some objective and diversity to the gameplay, but I feel it is really lacking in tactical-based objective seeking gameplay.This is a game that works well, plays great and has the community to support it. You get dig deep into the immense Battlemech universe, grind and build limitlessly, or just skirmish in a well developed combat game.			"

												Been playing this game for years before it came to steam. At the time of writing this, It's easily in the best state it's ever been in. If you want to try your hand at a solid mech simulator, pick this up. It's entirely possible to play and do well without spending a dime, all it takes is practice practice practice. Nothing that can be bought with money is any more competetive than what can be bought with in-game currency, it just might net you a little more reward at the end of your matches.That said if the game catches your attention the way it has so many others and you find yourself a true fan, it can be hard not to spend the money to get those shiney mechs with special paint and increased match rewards.

												Fun free to play game. I always loved robots and mechs so this is right up my alley. Was a fan of battletech universe as a kid too. the cartoon, ccg, and table top games ive dablle with them all. MWO does the brand/lore justice even if its not exactly like what you may be used to. The game plays a blast at first but some frustrations to arise. So id reccomend it but its not perfect. It seems pretty close to WOT or Warthunders business model.The best part, is that bad♥♥♥♥♥feeling of taking control of a giant robot and fighting other bad♥♥♥♥♥robots. You get those sweet FPS moments to where you clutch for your team or beat the odds. Its got the collecting and progression model which can be fun to sink your brain teeth into but becomes pretty grindy. Customizing the mechs is super fun too but its kinda diluted with min maxing.Biggest gripe has got to be the price point they targeted for paided content. Ill always support games I like but my commitments gotta be relative to all the game out there. Theyre looking for $20-60 for mech packs witch seems quite high to me.  Ill play a few dozens games this year and cant be shelling out that much regularily for trinkets to play the game. if that same content was $5-10 i wouldnt sweat it and could do it over and over again through out the year. think of having to pay >$20 for a new League of legends character. That price just doesnt work for me. Id happily spend $100 a year on a game I like but I gotta feel like im getting good value for that and a few playble characters doesnt really do it for me. not when that totals the amount of a new AAA title.Second gripe, the meta seems kinda flawed. For a world imersed is so much history and story the games kind of diluted by the shooter game at its core. Min maxing seems to be the most popular style. which take you out of the immersion. Everyone seems to strip off the classic mech configurations to load on the seemingly op weapons. feels like every ones got a million lasers. The light mechs go as fast as possible with biggest engine no matter what. peek out for a second and your bombarded by dozens of missle strikes. players strip the armor of the backs and unused limbs to max out stuff. anywhere people can, they go for the extremes. and why wouldnt they. they are kind of rewarded for doing so. its simply the math of it all. even tho the practicality of it would rarely exist in the battletech universe. in a shooter it does work. dps is king. you just have a round to work with and little consequence for losing. The last few decades of FPS gaming strategy doesnt exactly allign with the classic battletech universe. I think it needs work. Compromises to be made. Id like to see them address this. id like playing true to lore to feel more viable instead of a liability.All in all I say give it a chance it might be for you. Ive definitly sunk some hours into it ive even bought a few things and not regret it. The devs seem commited to it and the games improved in the short time ive been playing. I like it but im on the fence about my commitment to it long term. I hope it not just a flavor of the month because it really could become a classic.			"

												Fantastic game. I own 3 Orions, which make fantastic brawlers becuase of their seemingly endless armour, already elited my K. Contrary to what most believe, this game is not Pay2Win. If you pay, it's just to reduce grinding. Hero mechs are only a bit better than standards, and purchasing Clan mechs with real money is only useful if: 1-You're lazy 2-If the mech just came out and you can't wait.The ONLY thing that I dislike is the amount of grinding required. Once that cadet bonus is gone it can take almost 20 matches to earn enough for a mech.			"

												The game MWO is solid and can be a lot of fun if you take the time to practice and learn about the mechs and the weapons.  It is challenging and very team based not to many times can you be a solo killer in this game at all if any.  MWO looks very good and there are tons of things to do with building out weapon verients of each mech you get.  The game is very much free to play but you have to be willing to put the time into getting the ingame money for each mech you want because there are not very many that are cheap most you will have to spend at least 12 hours just to get the money for the avrege priced mechs if you play it smart.Great game over all			"

												Long time MechWarrior fan, and I have to admit this game feels very much like, if not better than, the previous MechWarrior titles from way back when.  Teamwork and knowing the particular strengths / weaknesses of the Battlemech you take out will drastically affect how well your matches will go.  My only cons with the game is that there's no single player or at least some kind of co-op vs AI mode.  Also not having any game mode population sizes outside 12v12 can be annoying....I'm much more of a 4v4 or 8v8 match playstyle as the smaller numbers allow for more individual player skill to shine rather than deathballing in a 12 man match.  Despite the cons I mentioned if you like tactical 1st person shooters then you should give this a go.			"

												Crunch has been playing MWO since open Beta in early 2012. He only recently added MWO to his Steam account. He has more hours in game than listed by Steam ... far, far more (but not as many as a lot of players).Crunch is a long time fan of the Battletech/Mechwarrior game universe stretching back to the tabletop and the first computer versions, Crescent Hawks (circa 1990). He has played multiple computer versions (including the Crysis mod Mechwarrior Living Legends). The long dry spell between computer games (2001 to 2012) led him to other games, with the Mass Effect series supplanting Mechwarrior as his all time favourite games series. Then Mechwarrior came out, and slowly won it`s crown back (as it worked its´ way out of Beta).Crunch could sacrifice many innocent and defenseless electrons telling you MWO is a great game. Many others have already. MWO is a free to play title. Give it a try. Make up your own mind. Be aware, there is a learning curve to piloting a mech well. Use the Academy to get used to the controls. Try out the testing grounds. Play around with the trial mechs.Personally, Crunch gives MWO 9/10. Even nearly 5 years after open Beta, there are things that need to be improved.			"

												The team behind this game is like a headless chicken. But the game is great fun, especially with friends. If you have played world of tanks, you know exactly what kind of gameplay and business model your getting into. It pays to pay for shiny new mech packs, which are locked for several months to people who do not by them, but you can totally play this for a very long time and have a lot of fun without spending a cent, the new mechs often change up the formula, but they never make older mechs unviable.

												+ Satisfying Combat++ In Depth Customization of Mechs makes your mech made just for you+ Awesome Community+Money does not make you better in combat... might make your mechs look coolio tho.+Nice graphics-This game might seem abit grindy to some.-Customiztion may be overwhelming at first.Combat in this game really satisfying, you can really tell you did a number on your opponent... when you completley blow off his mechs arms or send him running with a silly limp :D. The nice visual effects really add to that as well.Its more of a shooter that involves more strategy, teamwork and knowledge of your mech and, with experience, the weaknesses of your enemies mechs to succeed.Tho, having skills like a stready trigger finger and good situational awareness will also get you far... plus it keeps you from being deadz.The main thing thats really got me hooked on this game is the in depth customisation of mechs in this game. I've spent hours endlessly customizing and testing them on the battlefeild just to find that sweet spot, only to have my taste of weaponry shift again and again depending on me wanting more pew pew or dakka dakka. Or whether i want to be a ""In Your Face"" role or a support role. To simply put it, I love it!That being said, the customization does look quite intimidating to beginners and new players may be lost at first with all the numbers and different components. But the high amount of detail you can go to customizing your mech, right down to the armor in each limb and type of Missle, Cannon, Laser, Sensors, Engines, makes each mech tailor made to your intended play style.Glad to say, this game is far from a pay to win kind of game but does allow you to use real money to get what you want right away if your not willing to grind for it. But gives no real edge in combat in the end of the day.However, the game showers new players with loads of in game money when they start out. Which leads me to the biggest advice i can give to new players.Try the trail mechs first before spending all that c-bill moola. The game affectively gives new players the choice of any mech in the beginning due to the extra c-bills players get in their first few matches (first 25). So get a good idea of what matches your play style first THEN buy your dream mech.Last few words : Stick together and TEAMWORK is king.			"

												I watched all the videos.  Everyone said it's a ""thinking player's shooter.""  Sounded good, since I'm an old school RTS gamer and I've always prefer games that weren't twitch-based.So...I started trying to play a laser mech because they don't run out of ammo.  Lost 5 games out of 6.  Badly.  I decided to try something different, so I bought 2 new Omni slots on a medium mech and outfitted it with 3 LRM10's and decided to play fire support.  Won 3 out of the next 4 matches.  Actually survived 2 of them to the end of the match, too.So my review of MWO is basically this: it's a shooter where you CAN be tactical, deliberate, and patient.  You just can't play like that right up in the enemy's face.  If you aren't looking for a twitch shooter, you can still find a home here, but just do yourself - and your team - a favor and switch to a missile mech because that's the only class where someone with slow reflexes (like myself - hey, I admit it) can really be more help than harm.And who knows.  You might get lucky and kill someone with the lone Medium Pulse Laser you have.  Like I did 2 matches ago.  Hey, it happens.EDIT: Just wanted to add a little tip.Once you die in a match, it's helpful to watch other players and learn how they play, but if you don't want to, you can quit the match.  When you do, your mech will show as ""in mission"" and you can't play another match until the game finishes.When this happens, switch to another mech and queue for another game.  You will still get credit once the other match finishes, and you can switch back to your other mech for the next match.  In this way, you do not have to sit on your hands for several minutes waiting for the game to end.And if you love one specific mech, you CAN own two of the same mech, too.			"

This game has it all, and it does pay homage in part to the original board game.  Clan mechs fight beside Inner Sphere in 12 vs. 12 matches that take place on battlefields larger than you can comprehend.  Survival is an art--as is the kill.

												Despite its questionable pricing model, MechWarrior Online is just way too much fun to play.It's relatively complex when it comes to customization, but the game is tons of fun. My opinion is somewhat biased (or not biased at all, as it would push me to scrutinize the game harder) because I have been a long-time fan of the BattleTech/MechWarrior franchise and series. I've played the MechWarrior games since the first, and always enjoyed them.All that said, I found myself pleasantly surprised with MWO. I feel like they have done the franchise justice quite well, and, although I had concern that the Clans weren't getting a lot of love, we have gotten quite a hefty hand of Clanners recently, along with IIC 'Mechs, and more Clanners incoming even.If I have anything to complain about, it's that the 'Mechs don't totally feel like 'Mechs at times. They control a little too... Smoothly? I guess? Smooth is good, but something about it feels 'too' fluid, if you know what I mean. Also, when a 'Mech is destroyed, it feels like there's no real weight behind its descent... But these are minor, minor complaints. I adore this game, and if you want a fun technical shooter with a strong focus on teamwork and patience, start playing. You don't lose much if you don't like it, really, the game is free.			"

												Warning! This game can be extremely addictive!I am a Tier 1 MWO veteran who has been playing this game for 2 years almost exclusively. You won't understand why until you are the last pilot alive, forced to confront five enemy Mechs with a cored centre torso, having only half your weapons at your disposal. The adrenaline rush in this game is real.When you achieve victory on those situations, your satisfaction is immense: both intelectual and physical. You can't win at this game with just twich reflexes. You need tactical and situational awareness, teamwork (not even the best MWO players can win their matches on their own) and some serious multi-tasking skills. You need to know your Mech inside out: temperature thresholds, weapon ranges, cooldowns and projectile speeds, just to name a few, all while you aim at open components and hide yours from enemy fire.The learning curve is steep and extremely rewarding: you learn from every defeat and victory. You hate some Mechs or weapons until you learn something new that makes you love them. You learn how to handle your legs independently from your torso, and then it's time to spread damage by torso twisting...I have been playing this game for 2 years and every day I learn something new. And that's why I keep coming back.The experience is so rich and engaging, you just can't get enough of it. I know I can't.			"

I dont think you would ever have to pay a dime to win, i find the Ebon Jaguar is great and if you buy it and customize it, you will dominate the battlefeild from afar.What's important is its free, not too hard to get the hang of (if your willing to learn) and NOT PAY TO WIN. I dont usualy play f2p games, but i just had to give this a go, and i regret every time i gave this game a pass simply because it was f2p.Money is not very easy to earn however, and this could have hurt gameplay if you were limited to the mechs you own, but instead you get trial mechs that let you change up your play style, and get a feel for the game without spending any of that hard earned Cbills. There is special currency that is kind of expensive in real money, and lets you buy special mechs, and lets you buy normal mechs cheaper. Overall this game is worth your time, and honestly, your money. i would go ahead and pay 15 bucks to get enough of that yellow currency to buy a mech that best suits your favorite playstyle.			"

												I've been playing this game since right before Clans dropped, when fellow clanmates got me into it. As such, I have no gripes with what the publisher and devs did before I started playing, unlike so many people who are still salty about this game's beginnings. As it stands now, it's a fun mech game which focuses on player positioning, teamwork, and mech customizability. One factor that the salty ones are going to rant about is that they think the devs are greedy. Yes, the monotization model is rather expensive, but the game is not pay to win. You can play and enjoy the game just fine without shelling out any money. In fact, as a closed beta World of Tanks player, I can say the game is better priced and less pay to win than world of tanks is.I suggest you play and make up your own mind about this game. No point in not even giving it a chance. After all, it's free to play.			"

												I love Metal Gear Solid and I liked MechAssault well enough....needless to say this only has big stompy mechas in common with those series. Delivers tons of content for a Free-To-Play game and I don't mind saying that I've spent some hard cash on it as well. Need that new 'Mech for mastery, ya know? A game that really relies on teamwork and communication with some room for crazy heroic antics as well. The Faction play is rather slow (dead) but Quick play is always there for 10 minutes of fun. MWO has become my go-to game to chill out; the playerbase is the friendliest and most talkative I've encountered thus far. Outside of combat is the excellent and initially confusing metagame of customizing the loadout of your BattleMech after you purchase one of the four classes: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault. Trial 'Mechs are available to test out and they change periodically but you're really gonna want to get your own. I could go on but it's free so just try it. Lasers and air strikes, base captures and missile boats. Don't miss out.			"

												This game used to be a disappointment to me, and in a few ways it still is. The development cycle seems to be dragging at a snails pace, and the community has a shaky history. However If I were to compare it to other free to play games on Steam it comes out on top of a lot of them with really solid gameplay and customization, good graphics and sound, and on top of that probably the best in the big stompy mech genre for now. The greatest amount of naysaying you will hear is going to be from the old NBT Hardcore Vets. The real Battletech badasses of a bygone age. This game is not even close to a carbon copy of the good old days of Mechwarrior 4 Mercs some of the most well organized league play I have ever seen. I was very young when I watched my brother's Dad play on Clan Smoke Jaguar, The Jade Falcons, and even The Blazing Aces (of which I was a member of sometime until the MWO went through a period of great stagnation.)All in all, if you play these games for fun, you are going to have fun. If you play the game wanting to get back in to league play the exact same way you did back in NBT, you are gonna have a bad time.  "

												Overall this game feels like it lives up to the MechWarrior standard we all know and love. I read reports of it feeling incredibly Pay2Win in the early stages. This discouraged me quite a bit until I decided to play just recently. And I have to say, they have fixed this massive issue from my experience so far.This game sets you in the seat of any one of dozens of building-sized mechs (with variations for every appetite of carnage) as it pits you against one another in a thought-provoking strategy. Run&Gunners will not like this game, outright, to be successful you need to utilize what you can with your team and weigh strategies. A single mech can turn the tide of battle depending on the game type and the strategy employed.PROS:-High on the thought-provoking based gameplay. (Moves/actions/assaults require tactics)-Built-in Voice to assist with this-The mech choices feel endless and nearly every style of ""approach"" can be found in at least one mech-Weapon balance is very sold, something you expect from a MW game-Builds for any mech can keep even veteran tinkerers happy-Maps have variety (even if people only choose a few maps)-The game feels organic and very immersive as you are set in the cockpit of a 30-100 ton war machine-The smallest mechs have strategies to employ against the largest, and vice versa. Not one mech can truly reign as ""king of mechs""CONS:-New players will feel overwhelmed with the amount of options and how to actually build/load a mech-The tutorial is nice but not as extensive as the game itself-There is no ""try before you buy"" unless your mech of choice happens to be in the weekly(?) trial mech line-up-EXP gain and Credits gain after your first few battles feels molasses in January slow-Game requirements may be high for some older PC'sOverall the gameplay is as solid as titanium with a few flaws in regard to resource income. Good visuals, good gameplay, and the community is actually quite friendly for a team-based competitive game. Let's just say I'd rather meet with MWO folk than LoL/DOTA2 folk any day of the week.Solid 9.5/10Promote whoever did the improvements for this game.			"

												I do recomend the game it self yes. But there are 4 problems with it.1) (Weapons) The use of lasers is the recomended weponery in the game it self. I use them myself quite a lot but the difference between Laser, Balistic and Missle Weapons IS ATRETOUICe. Its so bad I mean not to say anything bad to the developers but you guys need to please balance them. (Laser weapons are the pinnicle weapon of the game it is the most used weapon on the battlefield but its exteamly unballenced betweem Clan and Inner Sphere. The InnerSphere type weapons have less range and damage and even have more Heat than there Clan Counter part, However Clan Tech have increased Range, Durration and Damage(Whitch I think is totally unfair). (Ballistic Weapons InnerSphere Ballistic type weapons are probably not the way you want to go if you want a ballistic type.The InnerSphere type ballistic weapons are HORRIBLE comparred to Clan. 1. More Relod time 2. More Heat in numbers 3. less range and last but not least fire mobility. With the InnerShpere Ballistic you only have one shot which is totaly fine its just that you can never seem to get a hit unless under 120 Meters Away! I Mean I fit and AC/20 on a mech of mine and( I do know all of the Ranges of the weapons) absollotly do no damage at all even though I can Clearly see the mech Rock back and the explosion on the mech it self. However Clan Mech balistic weapons have 1. More damage 2.More range 3 less weight 4. More range and finnaly Having thae chance to be able to hit somthing. The clan Balistic waepons are almost aoutomatic with the C AC/20 has a four round Burst comparred to the C UAC/20 which has I think 6. But of course the InnerShpere has only one shot. the Clan weaponry in balistics is Far supirrior to InnerSphere.(Missle) How do i start this.................MISSLES ARE USLESS UNLESS YOU HAVE LIKE 6 SRM 6's ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIT ANYTHING WITH THEM EVEN IF YOU HAVE A LOCK! Especcialy when you have that guy with Radar Deprivation or have a Clan ECM or its counter part its bassicly impossible to even get a hit unless you hve Streak but thats not the point missle damage is so Messed up like I willbe in the trial ATLAS (AS7) with the AMS and the Missles just keep on coming  but guess what the AMS DOESNET HELP! all it does is fire a bunch of pretty lights that do nothing! 2) (Mechs) The Differnces between Clan and InnerSphere mechs is way ou of the Border line. Clan comparred to InnerSphere is So Unbalanced. Clan has more armour, MASC and even come with Lighter Weapons and equipment I mean if you gety Double Heat Sinks the Clan ones only take up one less slot (WHICH IS TOTAL CRAP) Becasue some of the mechs have so much more carry weight than Innersphere plus thay can fit almsot twice as many on theres! (Cost) The cost between Clan and InnerSphere is UNBARRABLE like a Locust will only cost 1,207,304 C bills but the ADDER Cost's 6,998,709 C Bills. I mean come on Lower the prices becasue ven if you want a Clan Mecha it will Take YOU MONTHES TO GET EVEN CLOSE! it took me 3 days with the Cadet Bounuses plus the good games! You could Comparritvely buy 1 Clan Mech commpared to 3 InnerSphere I MEAN WHAT THE HECK DAYS OF GRINDING FOR ONE MECH WHY!!!!! It takes forever to even get money if you lose your minimum is 50,000 which isnt even enough to get anywhere but even if you win with 3 kills you only get 100,000! The only way to even get money is to Pay to win Unless you pay for premium time! 3) (Matchmaking) One word......HORID............I am a rank 3 player and somethimes ILL BE IN A RANK ONE MATCH! (best players) Ill die instantly to these pros and my team completely sucks! I will also get in a lobby with one of my freinds and it takes 10 min to get in a match! Please Fix it!4) (Other Players) The other players in the game ether 1. dont listen and get themselves killed or 2. Get in the way. the players need to understand this is a Team Based game not some La De Da FPS it takes Real teamwork to Get good and beat the other team. Which you will take time to get skill and you will have Triumph in this game but thats not the matter the matter is the players dont respect the fact that this game is for team building and teamwork among the Lances on your Team. It takes skill and Effort to win. "

												As a person who has played the game for two years I can honestly say that this game has kept my attention longer than any other game to date. It has an extremely high learning curve and isn't very new player friendly. The developers are extremely slow to balance imbalances within the game and often listen to twitter posts more often than the actual ""competitive"" players so there is a bit of incompetency within the games development cycle. Additionally, the game runs like poo if you dont have a really good cpu. Ignoring that, the gameplay is solid. It is a battle mech arena styled shooter and doesn't really cater to any other gameplay.			"

												I strongly recommend this game to anyone who likes the idea of fighting in customizable stompy robot tanks.If you are a Battletech/Mechwarrior fan and haven't yet picked this up, you owe it to yourself to download it and play.  If you played it back and left, you should try it again.  I've enjoyed playing both quick match (which I rarely have to wait more than a minute), and community/faction warfare games.  As a fan of ""Instant Action"" games from MW 2/3/4, this scratches that itch perfectly.  I really like the variety of maps and mission types.  Plays great with a mouse and keyboard.Unlike a lot of other F2P games, you don't have to put in money to get enjoyment out of the game.  There are bonuses for completing the tutorial up to about 6 million C-bills (currency), and you get a bonus for the first 25 quick match games you play - win or lose - which amounts to about another 8 million.  This is enough to buy one of the really large assault battlemechs or a couple of the smaller ones (I personally recommend medium or heavy for newer players).  I also don't feel that it is pay-to-win, since real money can get you more variety faster - or cosmetic items, but it won't make you a better player.   Money can't make you more situationally aware, a better team player, or a better communicator.  Summary: If you like customizating robot tanks and shooting at people in a 12v12 team environment, play this game.  It's free.  If you like it, support it by buying a Steam pack or a premium/mastery pack from the MWO website.Side note: I'm glad that my friends taught me the phonetic alphabet.  It has been really useful!-----The stuff below are things that I think new players should know going into this.- I recommend that you have a mic or headset.  It's not required, but it helps since you aren't going to have time to type meassages while driving your 'mech.- Weapon groups.  Life is easier at first if you set your weapons to groups 1 & 2 (left mouse button, right mouse button).  Change it once you get a little better and can handle a larger variety of weapons & groups.- In-game money & grind: I would say this isn't as much of an issue if you are careful with your purchases.  Really try those trial mechs so you can focus on what you like.  - Inner Sphere or Clan?  Pick one to focus on - since in community/faction warfare you will be limited to IS 'mechs for the houses or Clan 'mechs for the clans.  The weapons and equipment are not interchangeable between technology bases.- Understand that you will lose matches at first - and that's okay.   Learn to communicate, call targets, be a team player.  A lot of the ""veteran players"" have given good advice on staying alive and being effective.  If you do die - spectate other players to see what they do right and wrong.- Don't go it alone.  Alone = dead.  Coordinate with your teammates.  A team that talks together wins together.- Spending *real* money:  Once you have played through the trial mechs and found a size type that you prefer, then look into spending real money.  The Steam packs are pretty good when on sale, and I would buy one if you *really like* one of the 'mechs in the pack.  Just be aware, that you need three of a chassis (which have different weapon loadout possibilities) to ""master"" a mech, which provides performance perks.  Also look at ""mastery"" packs - which are sold in the MWO gift store, or premium packages which have different price points.  (Note: before you buy a mech, see if it is included in one of these - that way you can buy a variant that isn't included so you don't have a duplicate mech). I personally have purchased the light 'mech pack from Steam first, since I thought it was good value for money, and the Marauder pack from the MWO website since that is one of my personal favorites.  I have been happy with both purchases.			"

Posted: January 5, 2016
												Love this game so far. Fair warning to new players though..... Within my first hour of playing and learning I was bombarded with name calling etc. by veteran clan players on my team about every other game for not knowing the maps, what my mech's role was, etc. It was pretty harsh.... and of all the time I have played online MP games this was probably the biggest bash-fest on new players in the game I have ever seen.... They are easy to ignore... Just keep playing on and learn!! I look at it this way.... if players take a loss in a random, match-making battle so personal.... They aren't worth the bits and bytes of text data they type when they cry about losing in a match with mixed noobs and vets...Game is free to play as it says and lots and lots to do for free. Trial mechs of every class to learn on or decide which you like, you can buy your first mech or 2 and load it out, as well as add some perks and what not all from playing the game. No purchases really needed. If you want more advanced mechs and components....asthetics... yea it is a little pricey with real money. All in all this one can be played without spending a dime and still have fun doing it. If you are obsessed with kill ratios, cool paint jobs, clans, and want to take this game from recreation level to ""my day is ruined because I lost again"" fanatic....You will need to open your wallet up a little...Graphics are pretty decent for what it's worth. Gameplay is great... A LOT of different mechs and configurations for them are almost limitless...and free. From what I have seen so far, there really isn't a balancing issue bc of this... Everyone uses all different mechs that are custom built to their style...and none really overpowered considering this is a team effort game.... The guy who goes out solo away from the group always dies.... No matter how good he is... A group of baddie mechs will tear a lone player apart.			"

												I played this game since closed Beta and I can say for a fact that since then, this game has improved DRASTICLY. I would have said early on that it was pay to win, but that is most certainly not the case anymore. That said, the game is not without it's flaws, but those flaws are minimal compared to what they used to be. *cough nonfunctioning AMS cough*I feel that PGI is taking a good route with this game and is saturating this game with enough mechs and enough unique builds that even if you have the same battlemech as someone else, your build isn't the exact same. And that's a fact.			"

												I love this game and it really is free to play. You can have a lot of fun, and be competitive, without spending a single penny. But if you're like me you'll probably like the game so much that you'll start to spend some money here and there. And thats what I think the developers of this game were after. They offer a great game for free knowing that the majority of folks that try it will like it. Then if you want to spend money you can to ""speed up"" acquiring things that you can eventually earn for free anyways. Or you can buy paint, decals, and other items to pretty up your mechs - none of which effects how they fight in battle so its purely cosmetic. If you like big robots slugging it out, or are a fan of the BattleTech series, then this games for you!			"

												I love this game and it really is free to play. You can have a lot of fun, and be competitive, without spending a single penny. But if you're like me you'll probably like the game so much that you'll start to spend some money here and there. And thats what I think the developers of this game were after. They offer a great game for free knowing that the majority of folks that try it will like it. Then if you want to spend money you can to ""speed up"" acquiring things that you can eventually earn for free anyways. Or you can buy paint, decals, and other items to pretty up your mechs - none of which effects how they fight in battle so its purely cosmetic. If you like big robots slugging it out, or are a fan of the BattleTech series, then this games for you!			"

												As someone who LOVED MechWarrior 3 and 4 and played the hell out of these games, I first was not confident, that a F2P-MP-game might be the right for me. I was afraid of P2W, OP mechs not properly balanced by the devs and all that stuff.After a friend convienced me to give it a try, I got addicted. This is the ""shooter"" I was looking for. Not that focused on reflexes and fast pace movement like CS:GO or similar FPS, but more tactical approach with steady aim and a deep thought in positioning to maximize your damage outpot while staying alive. And the theorycrafting, oh good, I've never thought that you could talk 3 hours about the best loadout for a certain chassis of a mech. But you can. And I friggin' love exactly this kind of depth this game delivers.Patches are rolled out on a monthly basis. The devs, well, TRY at least to be as much community driven as they can, the playerbase, although you find your foul apple every now and then, is mostly calm and mannered, which is absolutely rare for a F2P-title. But, you have to be that honest, there IS a small, but really really small, Pay-2-Win-factor in this game. There are some mechs that you can only buy with real money that have a specialised loadout and weaponry that may seem OP in certain situations. But a mech is still only as good as the pilot and when you suck at piloting, the best mech falls in a few seconds because he doesn't know how to torso twist or how positioning functions.As a BattleTech-fanboi, I rate this game a solid 9/10. The one point missing is for maps like Viridian Bog. ♥♥♥♥ Viridian Bog. Oh, and ♥♥♥♥ LRM-Boats on Polar Highlands, too. That♥♥♥♥♥♥s awfull.			"

												MWO is an FPS simulation (and yes, I saw that walking simulator tag...sigh) where you drive 35-100 ton death machines around and blow things up.  If this sounds awesome welcome to BATTLETECH, a universe where war is decided by these giant mechs.  Each mech has a ton of customization with the different weapon groups.  Lasers, balistics and missiles.  The game can be daunting for someone new, but it does come with tutorial missions and practice missions to help get new players up to speed.  Of course, you could also jump straight into the action and that's fine as well.Graphics are good.  It runs off the cryengine which while dated can still put out some good images at the highest settings.  Of course, it's also scaled pretty well, so if you experience performance issues feel free to turn down some settings.  The only gripe I have with the graphics is low-light vision.  Sometimes it gets hard to see enemy mechs, especially on night maps.  There are two vision modes designed to help with that.  Thermal (triggered by pressing H) allows you to see the heat signatures of enemy mechs.  Hot objects glow bright white in this view, but be careful not to use it on the Terra Therma map or you'll go blind.  It can also sometimes be hard to drive with this mode especially in cities as buildings don't show up too well.  The other vision mode is night vison (Triggered by pressing n) which is the same green-screen that you would expect.  It works well most of the time and provides good contrast but it has problems with smoke.Controls are pretty simple but you have to get used to thinking of your mech as a tank.  Comming from World of Tanks and a longtime battletech fan, it wasn't hard for me to get used to this but some people really struggle not being able to strafe side to side.  You have to turn your legs first!  I've tried it with a controller as well and it takes some configuring but you can set it up no problem.Gameplay is awesome.  It's an FPS but mechs have lots of health so you can take a few hits and trade with enemies.  Position and line of sight is also really important, as is TARGETING.  There is a radar screen but only the mechs you and your team target will show up on the map.  There is a lot of info warfare demonstrated in this game and I love it.  There are target painting lasers, beacon rockets that can light up enemy mechs for the world to see, ECM and counter ECM, active probes.  I could go on all day.  There are a lot of really skilled players out there that have written and videoed great guides, or just, had fun!  The game is fairly balanced for the most part but it is very heavy on teamwork and focus fire.  Individual 1v1s are rare, and sometimes they aren't always in your favor as different mechs have different roles, some mechs are superb duelists while some mechs are more long-range fire support.  If a duelist gets in close to a fire support mech that fire support mech is probably dead, that's why this game relys so much on teamplay.Mechwarrior, and battletech, has a lot of fans.  If you love battletech, you'll love this game.  However, I have some tips and warnings for newbies.A tip: Don't get intimidated!  Battletech has a rich lore and a vast customization system.  Look up metamechs (its a website :P) mess around in smurfy's mechlab, above all else, keep an open mind. This can be a slow game, but it can also be very fast, it all depends on the flow of the match you're in.  Don't listen to people crying about P2W, for the most part, the game is pretty balanced on that front.  It's more, 'pay for convenience' and PGI has a habit of releasing mechs in stages, first stage is like a preorder, then it's available for premium currency, then it's available for C-Bills (The standard currency)A warning: You need a lot of patience to play this game.  The cadet missions and training missions give out some C bills, but mechs can cost upwards of 9million Cbills when fully decked out.  It will take you some time to get up to speed, but it's worth the wait, as once you have your own mech you can do whatever you want with it.  Fight in community warfare!  Master your mechs!  And have fun!			"

												Ummmm Yeah... This is Bill Lumbar reporting in for my first review of MWO.  I started playing MWO around 2 years ago.  I have always been a fan of the BT table top, grew up playing it as a child and young adult.  38 now, and through the years I have played many of the BT games on sega, super Nes, playstation, xbox and pc to name a few.  I used to head up to chicago to the BT center as a kid with my dad to get my fix.   Life took over and I found myself not playing BT games anymore, and for years.  I got that hunger again around two years ago and googled new BT games.  First hit I got was MWLL and I happened to have the old Cyris game so I was all set.  Jumped right in and I loved it... then bam!  MWLL got shut down/they stopped developing it.  I then read the rumors surrounding the ""why"" and came across MWO and downloaded it and started playing it more then I would like to admit.  For a solid 6 months, I dropped over 6000+ matches.  Within the last two plus years I have spent around $90 dollars on this game between two accounts, one IS, and the other straight Clan.  This game has faults..... that is for sure.  One of the two biggest issues for me has always been the painful ""grind"" and snails pace one progresses at in this game, even when spending hundreds or even thousands of dollars on it.  Thankfully, right before the Steam release... PGI decided after 2 plus years of very low ingame earnings to increase the C-bill and XP earnings.  I don't believe its where it needs to be, but it is up around 15-25% of what we all used to make per match.  I wanted and felt a 50% increase was long over due, but hey its a start.  Secondly, Prices for everything in this game besides Mechbays are pretty much crack priced.  How they unlock camo, patterns, and colors is just insane for the price.  All the bling for the cockpits, prices are pretty much insane IMO.  Third game lacks serious content and depth.  It needs so much more, and it has been screaming for more for a very long time!  Now to the good things,  Core game play is fun.  I am looking for more of a sim type game when it comes to BT... because I like to build sim pits... I love BT... and I hope they keep it moving more towards that style of play in this game.  for what ever faults this game does have, PGI has come a long way with this game.  I took a several month vaction from this game... going from playing around 100-200 matches a week, to only 5 matches a week.  The  last 3 months I have just got back into playing this game and am back up to maybe 30-50 matches a week.  This was mostly to do with PGI ignoring the pleas of many on the forums/forum warriors that earnings needed to be brought up so this game didn't feel like a snails pace.  Even with PT it still felt very slow, making not buying PT a no brainer.  All in all I would recommend this game to others, core game play is fun.... and I have met some really cool people in game.  The forums are a trip some times... much hate...but there is also a lot of love out there and some really cool people that love to help and also even share/give aways.  One piece of advice...spend wisely, and don't go on a crack spending spree....seriously, its not worth it IMO.  If you have the dollars to do that and want a place to blow them, by all means, knock yourself out.  Plenty to blow money on in this game...golden mechs.... you name it, PGI will sell it!			"

												Hello potential MechWarriors,I am Khan CoffiNail Tseng a unit leader of the Clan Faction loyalist unit Clan Ghost Bear International. I have been on and off heavily active in MechWarrior since May 2010, a year before MWO was even announced playing in a MechWarrior mod for the game Crysis. I was a zealous fan of MWO from the start of announcements for MechWarrior Online using a daily puzzle of the Atlas concept artwork and twitter to stir a buzz felt around the net. I was so crazy in love with this game I ended being the 25th register forum member. I still play this game and am more a grey knight than a zealous fan for various reasons, but I am a die-hard Mechhead and love to see MechWarrior in the spotlight it had back in the 90s. The game has its flaws, but so does any game that is in development still, it may be out but it is a perpetually in development game. So the MWO you play today, will not be the same one in a year, as content is continuously coming out and being teased with.It is a great game. It has very well done artwork, and the Mechs are extremely well done. Animation is great as most mechs feel weighty and others make you jump if you run in to them around a corner and you skid to a stop to try and get back around your corner. Scale could be considered a little off by some, but with the addition half a year ago with destructible light posts, knockdown trees, etc the scale seems fairly well for Machines only a dozen meters tall. The environments are beautiful and I still find myself getting lost in them at times. Do you want a game that can be both twitch and slow, where good aim pays off to take down critical components, but someone who’s aim is mediocre can still do decent damage and have a great time doing it? MWO is a good FREE game to add to your library. If you want a game with a lot of weapons fire going off and an often chaotic battlefield or something to get a fill of stompy big robots this game is a great FREE addition to your library. You are someone who just loves to tinker with things until they are just right, shedding armour off this leg to add a bit more armour or heat sinks, crafting the perfect build and playstyle this would be a great FREE addition to your library. Honestly, it is free, so give it a try and do not take my word for it but experience the battlefield of 1980’s 31st Century Battlefield Technology. This game has had its ups and downs much like any develop game and the fact their game has been in a large sense open to the public since November 1st 2011 and the very start of their development, now this means they have had a lot of scrutiny and under the microscope. They have been developing a nestablished universe with a fairly strong fanbase. These fans have not had a game since early 2002 in MechWarrior 4. Of course these loyal crowd, to which I am one love the core universe MechWarrior Online was place in, Battletech. It has a deep and rich backstory that is the effect of an alternate history starting in the 1980s.PGI’s announcement of MechWarrior Online had a very exciting start. With a twitter feed giving daily in universe news written by the current developer of the tabletop, backstory universe Randall Bills. It had hints of the setting, a puzzle of concept art. The month of October 2011 was fairly amazing from a Mechwarrior fan’s point This is getting to be a very balanced game. No longer do you have a arms race to the largest Mechs with the most advanced tech. Every mech in the right hands could be a very deadly opponent. Like in this universe the elite skilled were some of the deadliest pilots, who could operate their machines like and extension of themselves. A green and fresh pilot in a Atlas, should come down to a veteran in a light Mech Jenner.The Customization of Mechs via the Mechlab. Giving you hours of lost time playing around to get your warmachine just the way you like it, with the weapons you like. The deeper meta of the mechlab is an art all in itself and is a core aspect to master in competitive scenes. Role Warfare: Where your Assault Mechs going in force alone would mean nothing, but a well-coordinated team, mixed with different weight classes and loadouts could crush a more numerous opponents. Your Heavy Mechs were the support and the force going in with the assaults and crushing the opposition. Medium Mechs the backbone of the game, your go to for price and power. The light Mechs of your team were experts as going in behind enemy lines and at using Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) to shield your team from enemy sensors.Intelligence Warfare: From the above lights, to other, heavier chassis with ECM and other electronics of the battlefield. Using your gear to assist in spotting for you Long Range Missiles allies in the rear or to jam the ECM of your foe.Community Warfare: The creation of units in-game. Guilds, clans, communities. The larger picture of the glory that is a game set in the war torn Inner Sphere of the Battletech Universe. There is always war, and this give the community as deeper meta game to bring to the table.Something always feels great about piloting 20-100 ton Bipedal Warmachine of destruction and smashing them around a forest or city. The rush you can have being the last pilot in a match, or as you take on a mech in a higher weight class, or even as that Assault crashing in to wreak havoc with your team.Thanks for reading. I hope I have given a bit of sway for you to try MechWarrior Online, or at least to keep it on your scope to try soon. We see the same games in different forms, and MWO has a bit of a different take on the FPS. I hope to see you on the battlefield MechWarrior. -Khan CoffiNail Tseng, Clan Ghost Bear International ghost-bear-command.com "

												I find it a little difficult not to recommend a free to play game, especially one that has the polished look that MWO has. One that has the look/feel of a complete pay to play game. That being the case I won't say - no, I don't recommend it. Instead I will say don't get into this free to play game expecting great things. As some reviewers have mentioned the grind is real. I don't really care about comparisons of other games and how much you have to grind on them to get anywhere. From my personal experience I have probably in the neighborhood of 75 hours into this game. I also have well over $80 into this game. If the cost of MC is the same it has been for a couple years then I have $95 into the game. So that's nearly 80 hours and $95... Know what I have? Ten mechs currently. I believe I have sold one that I decided I'd never use again, and it was a mech that I had won. Also one of the mechs I currently have I won as well. Three of the mechs I have I bought with real money essentially. So that means I've been able to afford to buy six mechs in the game with nearly 80 hours worth of grinding. And this includes using ""Hero"" mechs that net you more c-bills per match. If you spend real money on this game know that the ""value"" simply will not be there. I have never spent $95 on a single stand alone game. A full copy of a game, then DLC that comes out later, yes. But $95 for a game that completely lacks any kind of story mode, only allows for online multiplayer and last I knew in order to ""host"" a game yourself with buddies that cost real money. Bottom line is if you put any kind of money into the game you're essentially paying for - at best half a game depending on how you want to look at it. Because real money doesn't even come close to unlocking or allowing one to use all of the mechs in the game. Worst case scenario dropping $50 on the game has the potential to allow you to play with... 5% of the game, at best? I think that's pretty fair. And if you're one those that doesn't spend any money on the game be prepared for some major grinding. And if the grind wasn't bad enough the game becomes very monotonous because of the underwhemling gameplay.			"

												I was on the ground floor back in 2012 for this game and it sucked when it first came out.  However, on a whim i loaded it up and started playing it 4 years later.  The tutorial is a big plus into understanding this game and playing it better.  Aside from some of the prices of the add-ons in the game can be a little high, it is solid and it isn't a pay to win.  You can always use the trial mechs they give you and just keep earning money to buy whatever you want.  It is worth it and fun now and look forward to the single player game this company is doing for 2018.			"

												One of the best F2P games on Steam, if not the very best.  Outstanding depth and complexity but it's easy to pick it up and learn the basics.  The paid content is pricy but entirely optional - excellent mechs are available for in-game currency and pilot skill matters much more than any other factor.  Definitely worth a download, a great homage to the glory days of Mechwarrior.			"

												As a new player I kind of have to wonder where all the bad reviews are coming from. I almost didn't give this game a shot because of them, but when I eventually did there were plenty of powerful mechs to play for free and I didn't do bad at all. You get a nice fat bonus for your first matches and you'll be able to buy one powerful fully up-to-scratch best-level mech for yourself. I reccomend choosing carefully. The grind gets real bad after a while (to the point where a second full-power mech is paid DLC), but at least the game itself is fair. You can always use the free mechs if you don't care about the metagame and just want to walk a hulking mech to shoot people. Plus the unleveled versions of mechs are kinda affordable, and they aren't too much worse than top-level mechs.The core game is more strategical than most shooters. Because it takes a while to kill someone and you can't easily reposition, the tactics behind your attacks are invaluable. There is strength in groups, because in this game there's no cheap one-shot kills. If someone shoots there will be plenty of time to react for the opponent, because you won't kill anyone with just one shot and going back behind cover takes getting that robot up to speed again. If the guy you shot has 5 friends you'll be shot back way harder. So attacking goes in groups, that way the odds won't be stacked against you. More people is more joy, because if you brought 8 friends along the enemy will have a lot worse of a time. Then of course there's flanking and attack routes to keep in mind, maybe sending 4 guys to flank can be an advantage etc., you get the gist. Shame there's a lot of pubnoobs who don't care for strategy.The meta-game is building your mech, which is another collection of strategic decisions I won't go too much into depth on. The basic idea is that you can't have it all, you'll have to choose your strengths and weaknesses. The grind is more important. Basically free players can have 1 mech up to full power, if you want to max level another mech you'll have to buy space and get the mech you want 3 times over. Grinding up the money and premium currency for a second fully powered mech takes so incredibly long I'd actually say it's not possible. For all intents and purposes you get 1 max-level mech, you'll have to pay real money for more or settle for not-max-level-mechs. That sounds really bad, but keep in mind that not-max-level-mechs are pretty decent and usable.			"

												As a big time fan of Mechwarrior 2 and 3 I greatly appreciate the direction and feel of this game.  Much more of a simulation than Mechwarrior 4 and the more arcade like games that came after.  Also it is a definite improvement when I played the Beta in 2014.  Runs ALOT smoother on my computer now.  Downside is, is the amount of time it takes to be able to purchase your own mech especially if it is in the 12 mil C-bill range.  Still lots of fun and you are able to try out other mechs with the trial mechs they provide.  If you like mech combat simulation games definitely give it a try.			"

												Overall this game is fun, I have been playing before steam release, if your thinking about trying this game out you should play the tutorial because the controlls can be quite hard to get around to begin with, same with the machanics.i would recomend playing evey trial mech in the game to see what style pilot you are before you go buying your own. my reasoning for this is that i made the mistake of buying a mech that didnt sute my playing style, witch put me off for a while. A really handy website for this game if you get into it is; http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlabthis website allows you to look at mech querks and build your mechs before spending the CBills			"

												Long time closed beta vet. Very deep and rewarding mech game. It has the right mix of sim/fps/team tactics. It also stays true enough to battle tech to keep it interesting and nostalgic. This game is not perfect but it is super fun and it's not impossible to play for years without spending any money.  It does have a pretty expensive pay for convenience and early access system. These do not break the game balance as PGI is mindful to avoid pay to win. Speaking of balance, the game is a modders dream so balance is hard and constant. Lately PGI has done better responding to balance changes and issues. In short this game is my favorite game I currently play and worth a few weeks try to see if you like it. It's free so try it. My in game name is bradleyusm friend me and I'll be happy to help newer players get acclimated.			"

												In a single year this became my favorite game of all time. When I first heard of it I thought it would be terrible, and only gave it a shot because there was nothing else quite like and, well, it's free. And I'm very glad I did that.The gameplay is really good, with a lot of depth and customization. It features hundreds of different 'Mechs variants that can be customised: loadouts, cockpit items and camo patterns. Some 'Mechs and weapons are inferior to others, but overall the game is pretty well balanced.As for the F2P aspects, there are C-Bills, the common currency earned in every match, and MC, the premium currency. The best things that MC can buy are premium time, that increases C-Bills and experience earned in every match, 'Mech bays, that increased the maximum number of owned 'Mechs, and Hero 'Mechs, unique variants with a 30% C-Bill bonus.The Hero 'Mechs are not overpowered (some are actually worse than their C-Bill variants) and so players that spend money on them have to rely more on their loadout, skill and teamwork rather than the type of 'Mech they own.One of the biggest problems with the game is the lack of more advanced tutorials. The in-game tutorial only teaches the very basic concepts, and for everything else I had to watch tutorials on Youtube.The performance of the game, while not terrible, is still worse than it should be, especially for a F2P game.That being said, Mechwarrior Online is a really good game, albeit with some flaws. It is the only game I never get tired of,  and I can't wait for the new content planned for 2017 (new weapons, equipment, 'Mechs and skill trees). "

												If you have been reading the reviews, then you will notice a trend of either bitter long time players, or veteran players with a new hope for this game. These view points are obscured in broken promises, gameplay features, or the feeling that a childhood game is not what they wanted it to be. However, this review should be based on the game in question and not the previous titles, or the best laid plans of a company that has never developed a title like this before. If you take this game as a stand alone product and review it fairly based off its production, content, and concept, their is really nothing like it in the gaming community. However, players that have played Battletech games in the past, or played table top versions of this game, and use that as a back drop to compare this game are always going to have problems with what the developers do to this game.The truth is the player base is much older in this game and most are not skilled FPS gamers like in other titles. So the great whole of the communty wants balance to the game and often blames a lot of their own inadequacies on the developers rather than holding themselves acountable. While, the small percentage of gamers with skill in the game are left unsatisfied because their is not enough competition in the game. This is where the Steam launch means everything and where players thinking about trying this game should really give it a chance. This game came out in 2011 (Beta) and I started playing early on in 2013, but to many people this game is just now being released. If the player base expanded, with the current opportunities in this game, as well as the improvements PGI has been making in the past year, then this game could become truly great. However, players that have been here since 2011 have lost faith and are a little burnt out with the process. The bottom line if you like big stompy robots, and a thinking man shooter, then Mechwarrior Online is the game for you.My advice is check out the reddit pages, use the mwomerc.com website, watch streamers on Twitch, and try to find a unit in game so you can ask questions. Take this game as a stand alone product and have fun, as someone who plays it everyday I recommend it. See you on the battlefield!			"

												     >>>>>Good game, Good devs with fairly constant new maps and mechs, Not P2W, Free, Generally good community<<<<<      If your not familiar with battletech/mechwarrior it can be a bit confusing but once you get used to it its fun (the new tutorial is alot better) so be prepared to dedicate a bit of time to getting used to it.      You can pay $$ but its not really pay to win since most ""hero"" mechs have very similar models available so more pay to shortcut not pay to win, soem mechs are OP but they usually get nerfed relatively quick.     Also realize that its more tank like not one of the games where you have a instant reaction super mech (aka more strategy (battlefield) than twitch (COD)). Very team oriented as a result the solo guys always gonna be the first to die so stay with your lance especially when your first starting out.      Only real issue i have is no that is multiplayer only but hey in terms of mech combat its still the best imo. There were some issues with AMD processors on occasion(Fps spikes/drops(primarily regarding smoke/steam particles))  but they seem to be fixed,  "

												I love MWO. I think it's a great game. Reading negative reviews, i am seeing alot of people saying, ""The Devs don't care about the community."" I dont get that feel at all. Reading any game, there are always those that think because its a F2P game and they paid in some money, they feel they should get a dev to rock them to sleep everynight. IDK. I can't speak for them but i know every game has neg players like these. All i can say is, its F2P. The game is what it is, and to me it's fun. Recently just installed from Steam to make updating/matching up with friends easier, but I have to have at least 300+ hours in and have been playing since it came out. Took a break for a while and am back. and what i see from that year long break is a ton of new maps, new mechs along with CW, which i have never done. The Devs are always trying to balance mechs. THEY TRY and i see them trying more in the future. Sure your favorite weapon may get nerfed but that's part of the all games. You adapt or try a different mech with different weapons. Even the most severe nerfs still have all weapons still being effective. Plus nerfs and buffs actually can add fun. As of the Dec 2016 patch, machine guns just got a buff and are way awesome. Its fun then to take out that 6 machine gun blackjack and watch it wreck face you know? Victors got some love on the last patch - now you get to see a few victors roaming the bf again. They try guys. That's what i see. Overall it's a good community. I try to give advice to new players that i see sucking horribly. they just not might know that you need to be 90m away from a target when firing a PPC. Or they try and shoot LRMs at targets well out of range (over 1000m). As mentioned in other posts, there is a learning curve. My advice is start with a medium or heavy mech and stick by other players. Dont know where to go? stay with your lance. Dont know what to do? Stay with your lance. Live or die with your lance. and if your lance is full of idiots well...then you learn one way or another right? there are ppl that bark orders sometimes and my experience is, they usually know what they are talking about. Listen to them. Then if you die, you can say, it's that guys fault. ;)			"

												I'm an old-school gamer, gaming since I was in my early teens (13-14) and a veteran of MechWarrior 4 (Mercenaries + Vengeance). I played competitive CS and Battlefield most recently at a high level. My usertag back then was ""3N3RGY"".I have friends from MechWarrior 4 that have been waiting for the newest installment of MechWarrior since 2003. I, myself, and others, literally built PCs (computers) for this game when it was announced. Everyone had VERY high expectations. I played the game in beta and upon release.The game had numerous drama since, and if I talked about it all, I could write a 100 page paper. I'll try to keep it short. I'm stll a bit salty because I feel this game, MWO, has a lower skill-cap than MechWarrior 4, but there are simply NO mech games on the market. Thus, if one is looking for a ""mech"" fps game, then this is it.I still wish the game implemented suicide options for the mech, crouch ability, active/passive radar ability, and more freedom with movement, as-well as bigger maps and weapons with longer ranges with high skill cap to allow more elite/skilled players to master that have more hours in the game, to show their expertise over more novice gamers. I feel currently with the way the game is setup, a good player can peak at 100hours, and there wouldn't be THAT much difference with someone at 1000hours, but this skill cap just isn't that high (i.e. CS:GO).Anyway, as mentioned before, there are simply no other mech games that compare, thus I have to recommend. I guess I also have immense nostalgia from MechWarrior 4, and I truly have not met, not in Battlefield or Counter-strike or ANY game I played, as many DEDICATED, DIE-HARD battletech fans as you find in MechWarrior. There has been a lot of critiscim on PGI and Russ Bullock, but they have made efforts thus far and I have to support though (Though I am still banned on MWO Forums and they refuse to change my ingame name, ""ENERGY"").Nevertheless, try the game, love or hate it, it is one of the best if not best mech game on the market currently. I would love to write a more comprehensive review, since the drama around this game has been insane, but instead I recommend new players log-on to HPG outreach on reddit, as it's a very good MWO resource.Energy signing off....

There is a bit of a meta game but you can have fun and win without strictly following it. I love this game I have bought serveral mech pack and have no regrets from that.

												Free to start(first hit is always free, right?), real money to get into the competitive game, but worth it. Good game balance, quick match or longer term combat. So far very loyal to the original tabletop game it's based on, but with a few tweaks to bring balance and account for online 3D game requirements, and to rebalance due to min/max tendencies of modern gamers. The game is still evolving slowly, new mechs, weapon tweaks, new maps, and changes to combat rules.			"

												Free-to-Play PvP action-packed maps full of giant robots with guns and lasers. What's not to like?Unlike most other F2P games, this one is not Pay 2 Win - you can buy almost anything with in-game currency, and there's no huge grind. You even get a bunch of free (and very decent) Trial Mechs to learn on.Excellent graphics that run well on even a low-end machine, but look great on a high-end one.I can't really fault this game at all. If you like tactical PvP action, you want to download this right away.Noobie tip: DO go through all the training missions! Not only will you learn the game better, they also reward you with a ton of C-Bills (the in-game currency) that you can use to buy your first Mech.Noobie tip 2: Get into a decent unit and learn to play with a team if you can. I'm fighting in a unit for the Free Rasalhague Republic right now, ping me on Steam for an invite if you'd like to join us!			"

												Although this game does have some flaws and unfufilled promises (like a lot of negative reviews will say, which is sadly ture), I feel it is better than a lot of games on the market--more importantly, the developers are VERY active and patch the game twice a month. Pros:+No velicle tiers: every 'Mech will meet every other 'Mech in a game.+No optical camo system. I mean no ""the guy is right next to you but sorry you can't see him because reasons"".+No reapair fees or ammo costs. Every cent you get from a game, it's yours! No more ""premium or broke"".+NOT pay to win. The game sells newly made 'Mech for cash but eventually they'll be CB (game currency) available. Heroe 'Mechs are just slightly different version of normal ones, they are NOT ""better"" because they have to follow the same limitations (tonnage, sapce, heat, etc,etc) and basically use the same weapons.+Short but action filled games. Average is 7-10 minutes, great when your time is fragmented.+Depth in both 'Mech customization and gameplay. I played 5000 games and I still have a lot to learn.Cons:-1st person: some of my friends have motion sickness and can't play the game. :(-Acess is somewhat troublesome from places out of North America.-Hard to learn. According to developers you have to play 100 games before you know what you are doing.			"

												While I am glad to see the MechWarrior series get a reboot, this game falls seriously short of what people expect from a MW game. First of all is the F2P format. Though great for exposing people to the MechWarrior/Battletech Universe, it makes for a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ online experience. There are quite a few hackers, as to be expected, since the game offers ZERO hack protection. Secondly, this is still for all intents and purposes a Microstank version of MechWarrior, if only slightly truer to the lore than the MW4 games. Purists (like me) beware. Lastly, it doesn't feel anything like a sim. Try to use a joystick in anything other than the tutorial, and you quickly find yourself at a significant disadvantage due to the game's focus on twitch-shooting with keyboard and mouse.I'll be waiting on MW5:Mercs to come out, which is supposed to feature REAL content and not expensive perks. Although considering it's being developed by PGI, I don't have high hopes.			"

												Alright, where do I start?Also this review is written on 12/21/2015, so some information may change.- F2P -The game is a free-to-play game, so give it a shot. The grind in-game isn't as bad as it used to be. You can now gain in-game currency at a reasonable rate whether you do well or not. There is some content that's locked behind a paywall. There's some stuff you can purchase with the premium currency (MC) and some stuff you can purchase with cash directly from the mwomercs.com website.The premium currency stuff is mostly cosmetics. You can purchase mechs and stuff with the premium currency, but that's a waste. There are some premium only mechs with unique hardpoint configurations.Thankfully, PGI is rather generous, as there are ways to gather the premium currency in-game. As for the direct cash purchase items, they are typical pre-order mechs that'll eventually get released for purchase via the in-game currency. Some of them have special stuff that's exclusive to the purchase, so if you're a sucker for some of those aesthetics, feel free to purchase?- Gameplay -As for the gameplay, its a more tactical shooter, with a simulation game feel. It significantly slower than most shooters in the market, so don't try to play it like those other games. You get to pilot some stompy robots and shoot some lasers, ballistics, missiles and stuff at each other. And you get to fully customize their loadouts and such. It's rather entertaining.There are 4 weight classes of mechs you get to pick from. Lights: Played fast and twitchy. They typically have little armor and weaponry, but they get to run all over and wreck heavier mechs in various situations. If you have a twitch shooter background, playing lights may help you ease into the game. Mediums: Relatively nimble and armed. I recommend playing mediums if you have no clue where to start. They have enough tools to show you the range of what mechs can do. Heavys: Well armored and armed. Heavies are the bread and butter of the team, as they have the mobility and firepower to influence a match greatly. Most players play heavies for that purpose. Assaults: Heavily armored, and armed to the teeth. Playing a assault makes you a walking turret. You're supposed to tank damage and push for your team, as most players will follow you. If you get cold feet or are indecisive, don't play an assault. There's a ridiculous amount of awareness you need to play an assault well.- Learning Curve -The learning curve is steep. There are a ridiculous number of mechanics to keep note of. And a lot of them aren't explained at all in the game. I could type endlessly about it and probably not cover it all. But thankfully, there are various external informational outlets you can find to tell you about those. But for the most part, there's a lot to take in. So don't be intimidated by that fact. Just play and learn from your mistakes. Also, big tip: use the minimap and don't use 3rd-person view.Give the game a shot, its a genre that's been overshadowed, and who doesn't like robots?Also on a side note: PGI has done some shady stuff, so keep note of that if anything seems to be going south.

												Dezgra scum! You dare refuse my Batchal?!I've been playing MechWarrior Online since open Beta (August 2013) and the road has been a bumpy one since the original release. Though, it has come a long way in terms of user friendlyness and content. It's at the point between ""it could be better"" and ""just right"" for a multiplayer only game.MWO was once only 8 versus 8 deathmatch early in development, then became 12 vs. 12 with team play queue. Now, we have tutorials, ease of 'Mech customization, and Community Warfare (still in Beta, but can participate to gain the highest rewards) with more in production. So, content is slowly being added, but the speed of release can be a turn off to some. There are plans for PvE, co-op, and smaller 4 vs. 4 events in 2016.This is a fun game if you do not take it seriously and would rather role-play a Clammer (Clan pilot) with 11 other drunk, uncoordinated players. The PuG games will make you rage quit if you have a nack for skill and winning, so it is wise to pick up a team or join a faction and use TeamSpeak/Ventrillo to better your chances and reap greater rewards.I recommend this game to any true die-hard MechWarrior fan, as it is the only MW game availalbe (until Hairbrain Scheme's BattleTech in 2017) that has a resemblence of MW4's multiplayer. It's still a decent simulator/shooter despite most of its flaws.MWO is one of those games you can splurge for a month, drop it for a while, and come back and enjoy relearning after some major content patches. It's easy to pick up for the price of free-to-play.However, MWO does suffer from poor optimization with many players crashing and disconnecting at the beginning or mid match, which is another off-putting minus to the game. Especialy, since loosing an Assault in a critical point can make battle exchanges lopsided before they rejoin.I hope to see some of you on the battlefield and as they say: ""Die well"" (because you will die a lot).

												If you are looking for a FPS with mechs and nothing else this is for you. If you want a game like MW4 that had single player and multiplayer this is not it. The problems with this game are a lot.  From very unbalanced unlocked mechs to the unbalanced teams.  A new player will find that they are at a disadvantage until they get all the unlocks for their mechs. And even after that you will find the match making is not that great. Many, many times you will find yourself on teams that are not balanced.			"

												Edit: As people didnt seem to find my review all that useful (9 of 15 as of this edit), lets try to fix that.Slower paced than hawken, much more unforgiving.  This is a thinking man's shooter; if you want to mindlessly kill things without any real skill involved, CoD is probably more up your ally.  Basically, you play a big♥♥♥♥♥stompy robot, loaded for bare and ready to ♥♥♥♥ up the nearest scrub to cross your path.  Think Gundam.  There are 4 mech weight classes in the game, Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault.  There are many mechs of each weight class, just pick one that fits your playstyle.  Each weight class has a different purpose.  Lights act as nimble scouts/Assault killers/Fire support.  Lights are typically fast moving, highly mobile, low damage mechs.  GOTTA GO FAST!!!!  Mediums act as nimble fire support.  Mediums have a nice balance of weapons and speed to out manouver your enemies while still putting decent fire down range.  Heavies are your fairly hard to kill well armed mechs.  Heavies act as moderately mobile weapon platforms that you dont want to get in front of in a light.  Assaults are your heavily armored slow moving death machines that can kill you in a couple volleys, but get shreaded if a light gets behind them.  Pick a mech and and stick to your team like a sad lost puppy (especially if your buddies are bigger than you, give those ♥♥♥♥ers a hug).  If you're in a light/medium, use your heavy/assault buddies as human shields while plinking the enemies in their weak points (which vary).  Shoot anything that gets near your heavy/assault buddy  If you're in a heavy/assault, pick the nearest/most damaged enemy mech and pull all your triggers (plural ♥♥♥♥ing triggers).  When you shoot, your weapons ganerate heat (IT'S JUST LIKE REAL LIFE!).  Therefore you have to watch your heat generation and not just mindlessly fire your weapons into the abyss, you'll overheat.  Much like a computer when it overheats, you shut-the-♥♥♥♥ down, and damage your internal componets, leaving you vulnerable to enemy fire (as you cant dodge/shield the damage).  So, check yourself before you wreck yourself.  Lasers generate a lot of heat, but have infinite ammo.  Missiles generate moderate heat, but have limited ammo.  Ballistics generate low heat, but have very limited ammo.Credentials:  I'm a veteran player (since beta) and I love this game from a PvP persepctive, it forces team cohesion and team play.  I almost always have a good time, even in defeat.  I have 1749 games on record (quick play games, not CW), given that ever match is about 10 minutes, that's 291 hours on record (just in match time, double/tripple that time if you count the time i've spent in the mechlab and CW). This game used to take a bit of a beefy computer.  Optimization has improved tremendously in the past couple years.  I wasn't able to play much in beta or through initial release due to having a crappy PC, but i got a new computer about a year and a half ago and picked the game back up.  I was amazed by all the improvements made to the game in the time i was away, and I've been playing since.The game has improved EXPONENTIALY since initial release, and it's only getting better since the Steam release.  Give it a shot, it just takes a few minutes and a little bandwith.This game's community is phenominal, if you want to learn something, go check out some of the streamers or youtubers, especially NGNG (No Guts, No Galaxy).  If you have any questions about anything, multiple people will be happy to answer you in detail.  NGNG is the largest group of MWO content producers.

The old publisher IGP (Infinite Game Publishing) was ruining what the devs PGI (Piranha Games Incorporated) was setting out to do.  This caused IGP to see the game as a flop and return the game rights to PGI.  Many of this game's founders and vereran players felt wronged by some of the actions forced upon PGI via IGP.  Since PGI broke away from IGP, the geme has been on an upward spiral in every respect.  IGP was a group of money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that wanted a flow of income from the game they had the rights to (to an extreme degree).  Many people are still butthurt over these things.Intense Con:  Mechs are expencive with IRL money, keep in mind, this is a small developer making a very high quality game, and they have to eat too  (plus the Mechwarrior Community is a niche with many whales who will throw money at a develpower willing to make a game in the nearly dead franchise)Potential Pros:  With the influx of new players from the Steam release, prices of things in game (IRL money) may become cheaper due to the larger player base.  PGI has hired many more people to work on the game (i caught this bit of info from on of the devs in a twitch stream chat)The free to play model is actually not too bad, with 16 trial mechs each on rotation (that actually have good loadouts).  Back in beta, and early release, there were only 4 trial mechs with garbage♥♥♥♥♥loadouts.You don't need to put any money into this game to have a good time, but hell, if you find that you're having lots of fun just with the trial mechs, toss $20 at the game, and get a mech or two.  If you enjoyed the game for many hours already, it's probably worth atleast a couple dollars.TL;DR:  New players, give it a shot, it's free.  Old players, give it another shot, it WILL surprise you with all the improvements made since beta.Edit:  I will happily answer any questions if it is not within my review, just leave a comment and i'll do my best to get back to you ASAP (assuming the question is something i can answer).

												Great game, has a learning curve, but good gamers will be fine. Get mechs fully mastered before you judge. You dont have to pay to play. Dont listen to the negative comments, just play. The devs work hard, they cause issues but fix them eventually.  If you like lasers missles first person shooters with tactics this is a pretty good game. Lots of the skill comes from experience. Cons, the community can be negative, there currently isnt a system to catch cheaters, and the good players will Crap on bad players even in victory. This is mainly with the top tier players including myself, thats just cause we are nerds who have no life.Recently since gaining the rights pgi has been doing larger patches, more events, more prizes. There are competitive leagues. There are social club units, there are units that do both. You can drop by yourself or with a group. There is a voice over program or you can use teamspeak and or Steam. The achievements are easy, some are tedious.  Yes you can CHOOSE to pay, but you dont have to buy mechs to have tier 1 viable competitive mechs. There are very few toxic players, but what game doesnt have those?! Alright have a good one and enjoy stomping robots.			"

												Free 2 Play - but you have to pay with your soul. Easily the most addicting game I've played yet. Nothing quite puts a smile on my face like powering up your mech at the start of the round. If you like tactical shooting games that require some thinking this is the game for you. It's very similar in game play to WoT, however it's nothing like the horrible money pit that p2w game was. However, some rigs might have issues. I have a 3930k and a gtx 980 (all under water in a custom loop), and I have some serious problems with crashing. Reformatted to windows 7 (from windows 10) fixed some issues. Rolling back to the 390.00 drivers fixed some other issues. I still get the occasional crash and restart into black screen but it doesn't stop me from putting 14-16+ hours into the game every day.Overall, I would highly recommend the game, and if you would like some free premium time to get started please drop by my stream @ twitch.tv/phone_microwave - New players are always welcomed and questions are encouraged!

												I had played this game before it was on Steam. It kinda makes me happy to see that it has been released on Steam.MW:O had an iffy launch, the publisher made a ton of f-ups and gave many people a sour taste in their mouths. But since the developers cut themselves away from the publisher, the game becomes better and better. I enjoyed MW3, MW4 and M4: Mercs. And this game feels like a good MP adaption. Destroying enemy's with PPC and lasers is just as fun as it was then. Hell the impact the weapons gave in this game are even better.There is 1 thing I kinda dislike, the consumables like airstrikes. IMO they should just be deleted from the game. But overall this game is a ton of fun.PS: Many people (mostly trolls) are crying about Hero mechs, claiming that its P2W. The truth is though, most of them are crap. Another thing is, they are pre-assembled loadouts which you can make yourself for free (and often better since most of them are crap). The only thing different from Hero mechs and free mechs is the paint job.			"

												I've always been a big fan of the Mechwarrior Series back since Activision had a tender-loving grasp on the franchise.. and CERTAINLY before the Mechassault Atrocity became a 'THING', not unlike how pancreatic cancer can become a 'thing'. But looking at what Pirhanna Games has done with it, I can safely say that whatever the future holds for the series.. it's in good hands.Now.. If you know me outside of cyberspace, you'll know that my position on ""Microtransactions"" (Also known as, ""More money for the money-god! Bend over, here's my fist! POUND POUND POUND POUND...!"") and how I like them about as much as I like Comming-Of-Age Parents who bring their SCREAMING deamon-children into R-Rated movies with the specific intention of being the reason why we've failed as a species. However, it doesn't detract from MWO's base-experience AT ALL. The 'Mechs feel solid (what little ones you get without having to max out your credit card to acquire them)The weapons hit with the satisfying force of a wrecking-ball covered in Thai-Orphans and F/A-18 Turbine Bearings.And the environment is ABSOLUTELY STUNNING......That being said.. I do have some gripes.LAG: BY THOR'S BEARDED PUBIC LICE.. THE LAG... WHY?!Hit Boxes: .. More like ""DID i HIT?""- Boxes..Crashing: More than a visually impaired Asian in D.C. Rush-hour traffic in a SuburbanMicropayments: ...(CENSORED) Micropayments..-----All-in-All, definately a worth-a-look game (especially since it's free) for ANY true 'Mech fanatic and newbie alike to enjoy!

												Pros: - free to play- easy to learn- not pay 2 win when it comes to playing casually- not hacked to death, unlike most other free shooters- unique, niche simulator, with fast-paced and, at the same time, deeply tactical gameplay- instant access to 16 Trial Mechs (4 different mechs per each of the 4 different mech classes) without having to pay or grind anything. The only downside to these mechs is that you can't customise them, they're all pre-built- new players get massively inflated rewards for their first 25 matches- plenty of diversity in terms of various mech classes, mech types, mech builds (weapons, modules, etc)- team-based game which rewards you for sticking together and helping each other- some maps are huge with varied terrain and plenty of cover, which promotes tactics like flanking- lazorz- lazorzz- lazorzzzCons:- very little gameplay variety: instanced PvP matchmaking across 3 very similar game modes on 18 maps, of which you will usually only play the same few, because people vote for the same ones most of the time- no PvE, no Open World, no real M M O gameplay - unless you count instanced matches for control of planets on a global map- some maps are somewhat linear and so small that you will engage the enemy within 30 seconds after a round starts, and the round will then devolve into head-on barrages with minimum tactical elements- key elements of combined arms from previous Mechwarrior games (and mods) are missing, like being able to pilot Elementals, drive non-mech vehicles, fly aircraft, etc- after your inflated income for the first 25 matches dries up, the game becomes a massive grind for enough in-game currency and XP to fully upgrade and tailor your mech- if you buy a mech and then decide you don't like it and want another one instead, you might as well make a new account- you will have to play hundreds of hours to get properly upgraded mechs to be competitive in Community Warfare, unless you want to buy your way to pimped mechs, which cost dozens (if not more) dollars per unit- some consumables are low-skill and incredibly cheesy, like air strikes and artillery strikesVerdict:9/11 ign			"

												The only way to get entertainment of this game is if you have a basketballhoop recycling bin to freetthrow it into.4/10 too bland and they force you to sign up and do training that dosent even touch on the various features of the menus and numbers and displays and such.  The older versions are much much better.  Sorely lacking the physics to make this game truly awesome, also city crushing, planetary conquests in single players with an in depth team/base simulation remenis of something like metal marines on snes would be alot funner if you ask me.

												MWO is a very teamplay focused 12v12 tactical shooter. Teamwork and good positioning including good use of cover are key to winning. It is free to play and there is no pay to win. Definitely worth to download and give it a try.There is a nice, short ingame tutorial that teaches you how to move and kill stuff. Beyond that there is the mechlab, where you can customize your mechs and adjust their loadout to their playstyle. It's easy to spend more hours in the mechlab than in the matches themselves.In higher tier matches, even the geometry of the mechs and placement of weapons on them become important. The higher the weapon mounts, the less you have to expose yourself from cover to shoot your enemies. In short: There is a lot of depth to the gameplay to explore.The usual MWO Quick Play match lasts for about 10-15 minutes. Faction Play matches last longer, usually about 20-30 minutes. MWO is perfect for one to three hours of gameplay in the evening and a ton of fun. For longer playing sessions, it feels a bit too repetetive, but that's just my personal experience.Quick note for newcomers:If you are new to the game, you should finish the tutorial first and complete the callenges in the Mechwarrior Academy for extra CBills (ingame currency). Try out the different trial mechs available to you in Quick Matches, until you know which kind of mech suits your playstyle best. Once you earned your complete cadet bonus (you get extra CBills in your 25 first Quick Matches), you will have gathered more than enough money to buy your first mech and start to customize it.That's about it. Good hunting mechwarrior!			"

												I Beta Tested. I Backed it. I left it a long time ago.It was refreshing abit to come back, but the core issues on the game keep coming back to me on this, and as such - I just cannot reccomend it.There is so much in this that ""isn't"" how it should feel to me, making this off-putting, at least as it is for this specific game/goal.It is not Mechwarrior. It isn't anywhere close to BattleTech. That much makes the naming only for the looks - but I have to admit, it looks great. Its just not the same in either the lines of the old Mechwarrior games, and the translation of the numbers from BattleTech makes this feel choopy.The gameplay is much the same as it was. It feels ""floaty"" in a way that can only be described as this is a FPS with a mech-skin. Think Modern Warfare or Call of Duty and the gameplay makes so much more sense.The biggest issue for me is the mechs have no weight. They feel light as a feather, responsive as any twitch-shooter, and as such breaks the immersion of the idea - you forget you are driving 100-ton mechs when the respond like a sports car.That to me is why this doesn't feel right. But that's my feelings on it.The game itself, the way it plays, the intent the devs have put into this is... alright, but its just not how I would think the game should be. It doesn't strike me as Mechwarrior outside the appearance. And that's it.The other major reason I gotta complain? When I backed this in its beta the cost for mechs and parts were reasonable. Cheap, effective - now? Its like pulling teeth through your toenails. They bleed you dry in this Pay 2 Win. And it is P2W. You need to grind for perks, grind for credits, grind for that mech - until you grind to the parts that work and eventually the neigh-broken Clan equip. All the while others are standing on the top of that shooting you back down to the ground.It just doesn't feel right. The MM is dodgy that way, often placing vets against newbies, slanting the games into a slaughtering ground. All and all.. it feels much the same it was back in the day. With a direction that just doesn't feel like it should. Not Great by any means - but also not horrible.So long as you get into it knowing and understanding its P2W, grinding, and its somewhat off-kilter approach to featherweight mechs you'll probably enjoy it - but don't expect much more from it.

												By todays standards MWO just isn't a good game.If one loves mechs, yeah, that game is worth a try, but you should ask yourself, why have I missed it for three years?The grind is epic.The developers have no vision, a bad track record and basically held a good license hostage and force mech fans into their bad product.The 'core' gameplay is good, but everything else just isn't. Compare MWO to todays games it just can't compete.The F2P model is one of the most new player unfriendly i've seen so far.I play in Clan, since open beta and even players that invested hundreds of dollars complain about the grind.And the lack of players.PGI has created a viscious circle.Really good is the game for anyone who wants to become a dev and likes to examine bad development to avoid those steps in their own career.Should be tought in computer sciences.

Posted: December 13, 2015
												First things first: I'm reviewing this game based on what it its now, not on what happened in the past or what it could have been.Be aware the devs made quite a few mistakes in the past and didn't hit all the goals they set when pitching the game for crowdfunding (which was to be expected, since the goals were quite exorbitant for such a small studio). They made mistakes in their communication with the playerbase. There is a vocal part of the (former) community which is ""very"" disgruntled over these mistakes (and decisions they didn't like), so take reviews with a grain of salt. When reading reviews or discussions be aware that there are some guys on a crusade to make this game fail. Furthermore many guys are wearing the thickest rose-tinted nostalgia glasses I have ever seen in any game series (regarding previous Mechwarrior games).I'm recommending this game. It isn't perfect, but it is better than many games on the F2P market. Take it for what it is: a tactical, slow paced, vehicle combat arena shooter. As of now, it doesn't have an evolving endgame, but Community Warfare Phase 3 has recently been announced to be released around spring 2016, which looks like it will add long term goals. The game always had balance issues to some extents, but since the last balance overhaul it's the best it has ever been. The devs recently fixed some issues that plagued the game for a long time, and the overall state of the game is better than ever.Pros:- The core gameplay (mech combat) is really good, probably best of any Mechwarrior title- Lots of customization- All mech classes play differently but fun- IT IS NOT P2W- Graphics are above average for a F2P game- You can play this game without ever spending money (mechbays can be obtained in CW)- Devs frequently give away ingame and real money currency through events- Overall a really good communityMixed:- The maps swing between really good and bad- Balance still not where it could be- Game is not easy to learn- It seems to be pretty grindy in the beginning but it gets alot less once you understand the game betterCons:- Community has some self-proclaimed gamedesigners who depreciate all but their own opinion and constantly bash the devs for not designing the game after their (often terrible) ideas- Community Warfare is not where it should be- Prices are pretty high (don't buy at full price, there are plenty of sales)- Game is not optimized well (hardware)- The 3 gamemodes in quickplay play pretty similarVerdict:Try it, it's free. If you are looking for rock solid mech combat, this is your game.  You currently won't find a better one. Don't decide based on reviews, give it a shot. Ps: Don't buy stuff without reading a guide or asking the forum. You ""really"" don't want to waste  your cadet bonus on things you don't need.			"

A game that could be great held back by a terrible developer.Short version first:I had played this game during closed beta and for roughly 2 years after that. I stopped playing just after the release of the Clan mechs. I was disgusted with the developers choices and behavior. This made me and my friends decide to stop playing entirely. The game could be good but the developer holds it back.ProsIt's a new Mechwarrior game.The controls are pretty good.Deep and rewarding customization.Combat can be pretty rewarding.Team play can also be rewarding.Deep backstory.ConsThe developer.Long delays in changes, balance, and content releases.Many lies about release dates and pay to win elements.Convoluted and sometimes frustrating game systems (Heat Scale is the big one here)Did I forget to mention the developer?Bait and switch sale tactics for content releases.Balance, but this is typical in a game with such freedom and inherently built-in unbalance in the original game this is based on.Russ Bullock, Paul Innouye (Trained by Nexon), and Bryan Eckman.The grind is beyond ridiculous last I played.Oh and finally, the Developer.Seriously, these guys made Navy SEALS: Weapons of Mass Destruction.Now for the long version.Through a glitch in the developer's website I got an invite into the closed beta. The game was much simpler then and was actually pretty fun. I told my friends about the game, got them into the open beta, and we had a lot of fun. Then they started adding in some missing gameplay elements and we started to see how the developer was going to handle introducing systems and balancing. As timed passed we've played through an LRMpocalypse, Squawkalypse, ECMalypse, Splat-cats, Poptartpocalypse, and the Return of the LRMpocalypse: The Quirkening. We played through all of this. All during this time it seemed as if the developer that was creating these new systems were not the original developer of the game.Once Clans were released ($500 for a gold-plated one) is when we really saw the developer's true colors. You could not purchase the 'Mechs in game unless you spent money. They were quite a bit more powerful than the regular IS 'Mechs (they technically were supposed to be...). This forced you into a terrible situation where you were playing with IS 'Mechs and losing often or spend money and winning 90% of the time. All of us gave up on the game shortly after this. We've watched the descent of the game's population ever since.The grind, last I played, was particularly awful. It required many days of consistently good matches to be able to afford a single new chassis with no upgrades. You also could not test-drive them. If you choose the wrong one, you were out the money... no refunds.I mean, I really like Mechwarrior and Battletech. I used to have a spinning wireframe Timberwolf from Mechwarrior 2 as my Avatar. I really wanted to like this game... but, after ~2 years of abuse from the developer I just couldn't take it anymore.tl;drI do not recommend this game, especially if ""[you're] on a bit of on an island"".

												As somebody who played since way back in the alpha and for a couple of years after that:  DO NOT GIVE THESE DEVS ANY MONEY.PGI does not care about you as a player, and never will.  The people in charge of the game are a mixture of belligerent, arrogant, and willingly ignorant.  The game balance is... horrendous, but they will happily tell you that it's fine, ""in their experience"".  And it's been terrible for years, made even worse by Clan mechs.  The devs refuse to fix any of the problems with the balance, and instead just keep churning out mechs so people will buy them.  EVERY kind of content beyond new mechs is released at a glacially-slow pace.Not to mention PGI has employed some of the sleaziest, ugliest money-grabbing moves attempted in gaming.  Look up the ""gold"" Clan skins for some info about that sort of behavior.  And probably the best example of player confidence in PGI?  Look up Transverse, PGI's aborted Kickstarter campaign of a blatant attempt at being a Star Citizen ripoff.  The campaign was cancelled after less than a month and garnered slightly more than ten grand, well short of the minimum of $500k for development.Yes, there is enjoyment to be had here with the free portion of the game, but do NOT give these undeserving scumbags your money.  Keep the money in a jar, throw it away, spend it on devs that actually deserve it, but anything besides giving PGI money.They won't earn it, and the game isn't worth it.			"

Only complaints I have is that I havent noticed any new maps and with the map voting system there are some maps that I simply never get to play on, PGI should keep track of this and rework/replace the unwanted maps and match types. Also, faction play takes FOREVER to queue. I wish there was a single player or PVE campaign just something that didnt take 30 mintues just to get to the 60 second countdown to enter a match,the constant waiting makes grinding C-bills a pain.

												Sunday, January 31, 20162:34 PMThis is the game! I have been playing for a while and have never had a game I cared about as much. The level of customization is superb. Game play is intuitive but challenging. The community (fans and Devs together) is probably the best there is for a free to play game. You absolutely do not need to spend any money to be competitive at this game. It is a thinking mans shooter and stays as true to the Battletech universe as I care for it to be.			"

												I'm playing this game constantly since open beta in 2013. Main reason is because it is a pretty damn good mech simulator and there is nothing similiar out there. Huge stompy robots with lasorz, rockets and many dakka in arena fights. Perfect to me :)			"

												No other ""shooter"" type game has kept my interest like this one.  I've been playing since 2012 and I still enjoy logging in a few times a week.  There's a tremendous amount of depth to the game, but it also serves that need for a quick break when you just want to decompress after work.  Its true to the history and lore of the Battletech franchise.  The graphics are impressive and the gameplay is fun and strategic.			"

												You will not find a better FPS F2P game with giant robots that let you group up with your friends and annhilate the enemy.   You can customize your mechs too!I've played this game since closed beta.  YEARS, and I have STILL not become bored with it.For you to have as much fun as I do in this game there is one thing you have to do:Find and JOIN a UNIT.  By far, the greatest attribute of this game is the people and the community that play it.   There is an abundance of healthy, helpful, and highly skilled units eager to help integrate newer players.  It is strongly advised that you take some time to get plugged in to the community, particularly before you decide to purchase anything.  Though you will never HAVE to purchase anything.  There is no ""Pay to Win"" in this game at all.  I buy things because I am impatient and have more money than time, even though there is very little grind to unlock your full potential... even the out of the gate trial mechs are rotated and well crafted to be fairly competetive.The game is constantly improving, and new maps and mechs are added all the time.

												Alright let me ask you something, do you like 1. giant robots?2. lasers?3. tactical combat?4. Mech warrior?5. a f2p that is not heavy on the f2p aspects?Well then this game is worth a look for those who said yes to any one of the above questions.I currently have about 15 hours into this game, and yes as a kid I did play bits of of mechwarrior 2 and 3 so I am aware of a few short comings.LIke the lack of a single player mode, but hey let's be honest it is at least a new mech warrior title and it is free.Additionally, meta game is not as strong with this game, there is a deffinate lack of background story, but that is mostly because this is more of an online title more than anything. Honestly, for a free to play, I would recomend giving it a go.			"

												Great fun with friends, probably not the greatest time if you are running by yourself.  A constant stream of new content and events keeps things interesting.  There are no real P2W aspects, most mechs are buyable in game.  Certain achievements allow for Mech Bay slot increases and MC (the buyable currency).  All in all, I'd have to say one of the most fun F2P games I've messed with, and with very few of the business practices I hate that usually come hand in hand with F2P.  Highly recommend.			"

												I've already logged thousands of hours in this game before the steam release.I have only two gripes about it.1st gripe is, invisible corners and or walls.  You can obviously clear a corner, enough to make a shot and you end up hitting an inviso wall.2nd gripe is, when you run into someone, sometimes it glitches out and you teleport behind them or to the side, or just get stuck for a moment.  This is more noticeable in a light mech, and it really screws with you when you are trying to circle a bigger mech.  All to often has someone back into me when im shooting their back only to find my self glitched infront of them all of sudden enabling them to get a kill shot on me.Those 2 gripes im pritty sure its just bad physics bugs or bad coding, would really like to see those 2 cons patched ASAP.Other than that the game is puuurfect.  You can seriously waste alot of time on this, and it can quickly turn into a sport for you.  And thats exactly what this game is, an E-Sport, this is not a little kids game, this is full on mech battle simulation.  You are a Pilot when you log in.  Learn to pay attention to the letter of the alphabet thats on top of your enemy, because people will be calling targets by those letters, example - Target A will be called ""Alpha"" focus fire on alpha, beta, charlie, ect.  Learn to read and navigate the minimap/radar properly , those numbered squares are coordinates that will be called out to move to, to watch for flanks, or to attack.  Be prepared to strap in and learn millitary lingo lol..   ENEMY SIGHTED IN CHARLIE FOUR, FOCUS TARGET ALPHA!!			"

												Mechwarrior Online has been a regularly played game of mine for 3 1/2 years now.  I enjoy it because the mech customization and uniqueness is very good and that translates into many different potential play-styles. I continue to play because it is a game that still has the ability to give me an adrenaline rush and white-knuckle game-play occasionally on those close or come-from-behind matches.  It is a tactical shooter and rewards a good sense of awareness and the ability to work as a team.Community Warfare is fun, although there isn't much of a lasting effect of winning or losing a Community Warfare match, but that system is being continuously worked on and there are some big changes being made that will improve the system.  I recommend this game if you prefer a more tactical, unit-based shooter where you generally must work together with others to be most effective.			"

												I like it, I play it. Big stompy robot-on-robot action with a complex mechlab system to outfit your mech allowing for pretty crazy customizations. An interesting ""WAR"" option called ""Community Warfare""(I hope that they change this name pone day to something a little cooler).What I like:Combat is very, very, VERY funLooks goodSounds goodMechlab is well done(finally)Very nice tutorialGrind isn't bad when you consider that there isn't a tech tree to climb. This means that you can buy any mech or equipment from the beginning(as long as you have the C-Bills)So many events and chances to get free mech bays/mechs/items/MC that you could almost spend no money into the game and still grow your hangar every month.What I don't like:CW for many reasons. Many of which PGI is said to fix in the next 2 months, but we'll see. The combat is even better than in regular matches, but victories/defeats feel empty. Capturing planets means nothing as wel as losing them.Balance still needs work. I think that PGI's eyes were bigger than their stomachs when they decided to go for the 3050 timeline as it is insanely complicated to balance all of these different weapons systems while at the same time making them each unique and useful. Hopefully this will be adressed before any big tournaments are launched.Finding modules/cockpit items is still a pain. Better than it used to be, but still not ideal. I often don't equip them just because I don't want to go through the hassle of looking for them and removing them later. "

												Been playing awile. At first I thought I would be a light scout pilot, but found myself enjoying 300 meter or less scrapping in brawls. Situational awareness is more of a strength for me than being a good shot. I found myself being good enough in the Assualt Class mechs while still enjoying every other class of mechs. I find some Mechs to be higher skill mechs than others. I know Pilots that you give one small laser and a high skill Mech (need skills to hit with or stay alive)and they get massive damage done, a bunch of assists and a couple kills. That is not me in any way. This game caters to each individuals play style and differenciates everyones skill levels. Each pilot can build a mech that hightens skills or hides the lack thereof. My builds hide my lack of skill shooting while taking advantage of my abilty to know where the enemy is or is moving to, in a brawl, in a flank, or smashing down on my team. I am better than I was, but you long time Steam players start with more skill than I will ever have! That said, I like my chances against you. Thinking mans game, and you are a child my friend ( just kidding, almost).Smash and grab play style, long range sniper, big ballistic crusher, short or long range missle havoc wrecker, or the sneeking little evil back stabbing elite scout light that has the temarity to do such to a Majestic slow moving Assault Mech that rightfully and normally strike fear and apprehension to the enemy, showing it's superiority in almost every way, right? heh heh lolAnyway, I think this game is great. There is a learning curve some find tough, but every hard core gamer I ever met that stuck with it, they loved it and were too good at it to suit me, unless they were on my team stealing my kills.Do not use the center torso button as a crutch, get on teamspeak, fix your armour and get double heatsinks. Buy 3 of the same chassis leveling them up on the pilot tree, do not spend a dime on the game if you shouldn't, spend whatever you like if you can. Nobody needs to spend money to to be good at this game. gl hf			"

												I've been playing on-and-off since Closed Beta, with most of my time played after the original publisher (IGP) departed.I'm not going to touch on the history of the game, nor its previous states. If anyone out there hates PGI or this game for its history, I think their opinions are valid but I'd like to focus my review on what the game is here and now.Mechwarrior Online is a game about piloting giant walking tanks.As far as these things go, this is the best on the market. The initial learning curve can be pretty steep, but once you get your bearings this game provides an experience like no other. Half of the game is customization; swapping out weaponry and equipment on your massive death machine. The other half is tearing other players' mechs apart; shearing off limbs and blasting holes in their torsos.This is a game where your hitboxes, health, and loadout all go hand-in-hand. You might be missing your entire left half, about to die from one more shot to the chest, but still have armor on your right arm. Many times victory will hinge on your ability to shield your critical components just long enough to get one more shot at the enemy. This game truly shines when both sides are locked in this desperate struggle, trying to mitigate incoming damage while simultaneously finding moments to strike.There's nothing quite so satisfying as firing the massive, deafening AC20 and watching an enemy mech rock with the impact. No other game makes me laugh with such maniacal glee, as my 100-ton Atlas obliterates an enemy with a cluster of short-range missiles. Nothing gets my heart racing quite like speeding around the map in a light mech, scouting the enemy team's location and harassing mechs several times my size.I couldn't possibly hope to cover all the tactical elements or loadout considerations in this review. What I can tell you is that all the research pays off. The more time you invest in looking up strategies, loadouts and mech roles, the better you will perform and the more fun you will have. You'll learn which mechs to fear, and the range of their most likely loadouts. You'll learn where to shoot each mech to most efficiently disable or destroy them. You'll learn the best way to play to your mechs' strengths, and the result will be a game that keeps your mind racing as you work to counter each new enemy.This is a game I can't recommend enough. Nothing feels quite as cool as becoming a Mechwarrior.			"

												""The Thinking Man's FPS""TL;DR Big mechs shoot each other in a rich setting and beautiful maps with a focus on tactics and customization and teamwork.I've heard this game called that from the community as I've played and I must say it is very accurate. There is a LOT going on in a typical match for MWO. Constantly knowing where my allies are moving, keeping an eye on the Assaults (the slow behemoths) to make sure we don't leave them behind, scanning the targets that the lights (the small speedy ones) are scouting, and always monitoring heat while being under fire by the enemy team. It is exhilarating!Mechwarrior Online is set in the Battletech universe that has a ton of history and lore to back up the mechs in the game. While this game is less canon and more action, it is a still a great place for lovers of the setting to get their fix. The lore is unimportant to gameplay, so there is nothing stopping a complete newcomer to the game to feel left out.This is a game about tactics. You choose your mech from a starting roster of trial mechs after a tutorial that just BARELY gets you ready to dive into the deep ocean that is MWO. There are four ""weight"" classes: Light, Medium, Heavy, and Assault. Upon first look, it appears to be a rock, paper, scissors type of scenario, but that is entirely not the case. This game offers a ton of customization to certain mechs (which are available in two separate ""makes"" that are similar to factions) so that your assault can run with the heavies, or allow your light to carry more firepower than some Heavy mechs. It can be tough to pick a mech in the start and there is no right or wrong mech, but after a good game and some quick deaths, one quickly learns the pros and cons of each class.As I mentioned before, there are two ""factions"" that really only shine in the Community Warfare gamemode, which puts the player in a mercenary position accepting contracts from one of the separate factions in the game. Otherwise, a mech's faction has no real difference besides the level of customization. Mechs can be outfitted with weapons based on the ""hardpoints"" found on the frame. For instance, an arm could allow three energy weapons while the right torso could allow a ballistic and a missile. Mechs must be build around what is allowed by the hardpoints and weight limit while keeping survivability in the amount of armor and heat management that the build will allow.The Inner Spere mechs (IS) are special in that they allow one to customize engines, jump jets, and a host of weapon customizations. However, the IS mechs have special ""quirks"" that allow them to really shine with a certain weapon type that should be taken into consideration. This allows the IS mechs to be specialized to a certain blend of combat and makes for each mech to be slightly different from another mech of the same build but on a different frame. The Clan mechs are a different beast entirely. While the IS mechs can change engines and loadouts, the Clan mechs cannot change the default engines or jumpjets in their mechs. They do allow one to swap out pieces called omnipods that change the hardpoints on a certain piece of the mech to allow for greater variety in weapon loadouts.This game has a great community with a nice dry humor while at the same time being very competitive. From my time with this game, salt and toxicity has always been rare, something that I contribute to the personality that is drawn to the lore and gameplay. Being a free game, there is an incentive to buy mechs with cash to gain early access, but every mech in the game has a variant that can be purchased with in game currencies. There are also ""hero"" and ""champion"" variants to most mechs that give a boost to mech xp or in game currency rates, but they don't feel necessary. If you enjoy the game, the grind will be something you enjoy and not a burden. The only cash item that is ""mandatory"" or addition mech bays that allow you to own additional mechs. These are occasionally given away during events, but mostly will need to be purchased.In the end, I recommend this game to anyone who considers the RTS style games enjoyable and to anyone familiar with Battletech in general. It is a fun game and a great way to spend an evening.			"

												I work full time, and play a lot of mechwarrior, so I don't have time for a big review, but here's the gist of it:Come in with no expectations, and be very happy. It's pretty much like getting to play multiplayer mechwarrior of old. The effects are cool, the graphics are okay, the gameplay is slightly different but still about shooting lasers, autocannons, and missiles at enemies and blowing off their limbs.However, I have never seen such visceral hate for the developer as I have in this game. Everyone who plays routinely poops all over PGI (the developers). I understand the REASON people are mad. The mechanics are so solid in this game, that it's just BEGGING for some cool stuff. Cooperative missions, single player campaign, more multiplayer modes, really cool base sieges and destructable buildings. Those would all be really, really great. And yes, the developer talks about how those are going to be in the game, and yes, they are not in the game yet. Should that equal anger and a vicious attitude to the development staff? I guess that's up to you to decide.As for me... I still play for a few hours every day, so I can't complain. It's a good game, and it's a mechwarrior game. See you on the battlefield.			"

												Ive been playing MWO for a few months now.I do like this game a fair bit, and find it fun to play however there are some problems Im sure EVERYONE would like to see fixed or changed at very least.First and foremost is COST, buying mechs, MC, and ""decals"" such as paint colours and cockpit items is FAR TOO EXPENSIVE. Yes the vast majority of mechs are purchasable with some grinding, and there is a huge in-game-currency bonus for shiny new players; however many mechs one may want cost cold hard cash and are TOO EXPENSIVE.Experienced players have a huge advantage as there IS a learning curve, and on top of that the bonuses for ""working in"" mechs and buying ""modules"", which is really cool and gives motivation for grinding. Some new players may feel intimidated.PLEASE PLAY THE TUTORIAL. PRESS ""R"" to target (to share targeting data and help with teamplay).A Great game, please give it a chance.			"

												The good:>Lots of customization of mechs AFTER you buy one (there are lots of guides available on which mechs to buy for what playstyle once you've familiarized yourself with the game.) Want bigass cannons? Go for it. Like EZ aim mode lasers? Pew pew.>Graphical update in March made this game look amazing. Every mech has 2k textures and the game set to ultra high looks awesome on systems that can run it.>BIG MECH. Knock over ALL OF THE TREES. RaaaaAAAAAAA.>Smart play and tactics get rewarded. Idiots that rush in alone die, even if they bought a ""pay to win"" mech.>There is no pay2win model here. Most purchases are cosmetic; extra mech bays can be earned thorugh faction warfare (please save this for when you've played lots) and most mechs you see only for sale for real money are later available for in-game currency.>Your first 25 matches have a HUGE bonus to in game currency earnings. Save it for when you're ready to buy; the 17 million total plus whatever you earn playing will be enough to buy an assault mech.>Hot damn, the animations are great.>PGI is somewhat connected to their playerbase and actively tries to improve their game.>Free to play; if you don't enjoy it, all it costs is time. If you love it and never spend a cent, WOO. Free game!>Active and helpful community. If you have questions, there's always someone or somewhere you can go to get them answered.>Supprt is generally helpful and almost always polite yet concise. Even though they have a small team, they are a damn good team at that.>It FEELS like you're driving a 20 to 100 ton machine of doom. Even the smallet of these things dwarf some of the buildings in this game. The scale is AWESOME.>Every cockpit of every mech is different. It's awesome.The bad:>Limited maps in both quick play and faction warfare. You will learn them all fairly quickly.>If you want to own ALL of the mechs, you will have to pay for them in the long run. For some people, that's fine. Just be aware of what you're buying first. Do research on mechs before you buy. DO RESEARCH. You will hate yourself if you get something you do not enjoy playing.>Despite the few years this game has been out, not a lot has come out aside from a couple maps here, a UI update there. PGI has a small team; expect the game to evolve somewhat slowly.>Not every mech is a good one. There are balance issues like in any other online game with player versus player, but it sucks to buy a crap mech. But yes, research. You can avoid this with KNOWLEDGE.>No single player mode. There is work being done for a PvE campaign, but I don't expect it to be done any time soon.>Meta play gets to be a bit.. well.. obvious. Just be ready for the occasional tryhard with a 100% optimal build that can three shot you with alpha strikes. Of course, you can always shoot them back.>In game currency earnings gets really slow after those first 25 matches. Sorry. It'll be grindy to get that second or third mech you want.>Premium time in-game is used even if you are not actively playing. If you have 3 days of premium, it will be gone in 3 days. Regardless of if you play or not.>Faction play needs work. I'll not say more. It's fun and all, but it needs work.>Third person mode sucks. If you despise first person, well.. good luck?(who hates first person though lol psh)>NOT GAMEOAD/JOYSTICK FRIENDLY OMG Even with custom inputs it blows. You're stuck with KB&M.Overall: 9/10 game, would recommend			"

												If you are looking for a team based, tactical, first person shooter with big stompy robots this is a great game to pick up. Quickplay will get you matches fast but the best part is finding people to play with regularly in Faction Warfare. It is the most cordial PvP game I have ever played. Trolls are pretty rare, whiners are rare, and you enemy often will salute before a match. Teamspeak is a must if you want to coordinate with other players. Find the house TS you like and blow up other big stompy robots.			"

												Grew up with BattleTech and the MechWarrior series, so my opinion might be a little biased, but I love this game. F2P isn't the easiest thing to balance apparently, but I think they did a good job here.There will be grinding if you want diversity and mastered mechs (you need to obtain 3 of a chassis and grab tons of XP to get this) - not to mention the pilot skills which require an XP hit to unlock AND a C-Bill hit to purchase.New mechs are coming out all the time and the devs are pretty good about releasing new maps and/or upgrading the older ones. You've gotta pay to get into the new mechs when they're released, but eventually they become available for either MC (premium currency) or C-Bills (grind money).It's free, so you should try it out. Read up on some lore, too - BattleTech's is pretty awesome. :] And if you do end up playing, don't feel bad when you inevitably spend the $20 to get some new mechs + early adopter rewards. The devs gotta eat! "

												Ive been playing MWO for a few months now.I do like this game a fair bit, and find it fun to play however there are some problems Im sure EVERYONE would like to see fixed or changed at very least.First and foremost is COST, buying mechs, MC, and ""decals"" such as paint colours and cockpit items is FAR TOO EXPENSIVE. Yes the vast majority of mechs are purchasable with some grinding, and there is a huge in-game-currency bonus for shiny new players; however many mechs one may want cost cold hard cash and are TOO EXPENSIVE.Experienced players have a huge advantage as there IS a learning curve, and on top of that the bonuses for ""working in"" mechs and buying ""modules"", which is really cool and gives motivation for grinding. Some new players may feel intimidated.PLEASE PLAY THE TUTORIAL. PRESS ""R"" to target (to share targeting data and help with teamplay).A Great game, please give it a chance.			"

												The good:>Lots of customization of mechs AFTER you buy one (there are lots of guides available on which mechs to buy for what playstyle once you've familiarized yourself with the game.) Want bigass cannons? Go for it. Like EZ aim mode lasers? Pew pew.>Graphical update in March made this game look amazing. Every mech has 2k textures and the game set to ultra high looks awesome on systems that can run it.>BIG MECH. Knock over ALL OF THE TREES. RaaaaAAAAAAA.>Smart play and tactics get rewarded. Idiots that rush in alone die, even if they bought a ""pay to win"" mech.>There is no pay2win model here. Most purchases are cosmetic; extra mech bays can be earned thorugh faction warfare (please save this for when you've played lots) and most mechs you see only for sale for real money are later available for in-game currency.>Your first 25 matches have a HUGE bonus to in game currency earnings. Save it for when you're ready to buy; the 17 million total plus whatever you earn playing will be enough to buy an assault mech.>Hot damn, the animations are great.>PGI is somewhat connected to their playerbase and actively tries to improve their game.>Free to play; if you don't enjoy it, all it costs is time. If you love it and never spend a cent, WOO. Free game!>Active and helpful community. If you have questions, there's always someone or somewhere you can go to get them answered.>Supprt is generally helpful and almost always polite yet concise. Even though they have a small team, they are a damn good team at that.>It FEELS like you're driving a 20 to 100 ton machine of doom. Even the smallet of these things dwarf some of the buildings in this game. The scale is AWESOME.>Every cockpit of every mech is different. It's awesome.The bad:>Limited maps in both quick play and faction warfare. You will learn them all fairly quickly.>If you want to own ALL of the mechs, you will have to pay for them in the long run. For some people, that's fine. Just be aware of what you're buying first. Do research on mechs before you buy. DO RESEARCH. You will hate yourself if you get something you do not enjoy playing.>Despite the few years this game has been out, not a lot has come out aside from a couple maps here, a UI update there. PGI has a small team; expect the game to evolve somewhat slowly.>Not every mech is a good one. There are balance issues like in any other online game with player versus player, but it sucks to buy a crap mech. But yes, research. You can avoid this with KNOWLEDGE.>No single player mode. There is work being done for a PvE campaign, but I don't expect it to be done any time soon.>Meta play gets to be a bit.. well.. obvious. Just be ready for the occasional tryhard with a 100% optimal build that can three shot you with alpha strikes. Of course, you can always shoot them back.>In game currency earnings gets really slow after those first 25 matches. Sorry. It'll be grindy to get that second or third mech you want.>Premium time in-game is used even if you are not actively playing. If you have 3 days of premium, it will be gone in 3 days. Regardless of if you play or not.>Faction play needs work. I'll not say more. It's fun and all, but it needs work.>Third person mode sucks. If you despise first person, well.. good luck?(who hates first person though lol psh)>NOT GAMEOAD/JOYSTICK FRIENDLY OMG Even with custom inputs it blows. You're stuck with KB&M.Overall: 9/10 game, would recommend			"

												I've been playing this game since beta.At first, I was somewhat hesitant about MWO. You see, I’m not all that into PvP games. And, when I learned that MWO was all PvP, I really wasn’t interested at first. But, the lure of Big Stompy Robots eventually dragged me into trying it.So, there I was grinding out my twenty five cadet bonus matches in a Trial JM-6 Jagermech. My first mech purchase was a Blackjack as they were first released. I realized that this was a different kind of PvP game- it was slower, the concept of walking tanks did a good job of mitigating the twitch play that I didn’t like. Sure there was still twitch play with light mechs, but it was still a little slower and methodical that other FPS games I played.Now, a few years (and a bunch of mech packs) later, I find I truly do love this game.What I like most about this game, compared to other tank games, is the method in which you get your vehicles. See, in other tank games, you have to contend with tech/progression trees- forcing you to drive or fly equipment you don’t like in order to work your way into gear that you do.Not so with this game. If I want to drive a Timberwolf, I can either grind the CBills to get them, buy the MC to get it or buy it straight away from the gift store. Can’t do that with an M1 Abrams, German Tiger or P-51.I love how customizable the game is. Much of the fun of the game is spending time in the mechlab finding that perfect build that synergizes my playstyle with the mechs quirks and hardpoint arrangement. See not all build fit all, some build that work great for one guy may not work so well for other. But, finding that great build that works for you is truly satisfying.Another thing I love about this game is the regular events that PGI holds. Grab bag events, Leaderboard events, Faction play events and Cumulative stretch goal events, there’s always something going on.There’s a lot of good stuff on the horizon for this game-The fabled Unseens are being released on a monthly basis as we speak.  If you’re a Battletech aficionado, you can truly appreciate the return of these classics.PvE is coming; we already see glimpses of PvE in the Mechwarrior Academy.A large update is coming to Faction Warfare that will appeal to small groups (4v4) as well as large.If you’re new to the game, do check out the Spike Brave tutorials on youtube. Also, play the Mechwarrior Academy, play it a lot, play it some more. The Mechwarrior Acandemy is a great resource.Give the game its fair shake, just like I did, and I think you will be impressed with it, just like I am.			"

												I've always liked the mechwarrior franchise and this game, for me, delivers. That being said this is a multi-player only game with the exception of some training missions. The mech lab is a game in and of itself and I enjoy outfitting my mechs to meet whatever game mode I am going to play. This game has a strong focus on team play. That's not to say you can't jump in a quick game and have fun, but if you run off by yourself most likely you will get smashed. Stay with your team and communicate.I recommend this game to any Mechwarrior fan, or anyone who likes simulation type games.			"

												TL;DR - It's not perfect, but it's my perfect.First off, my credentials to write this review: I've been a fan of Battletech and Mech based games and shows in general since I first picked up MechAssault for the Xbox around 12 years ago and shortly thereafter fell in love with the MechCommander games for PC and have been a giant stompy robot lover since.  I've also purchased every top package for MechWarrior Online from Legendary Founders through the latest unseen mechs and have probably sunk about 300+ hours of play time into this title before the steam launch and have been playing since beta.  Ok, on to the review: MechWarrior Online has had it's rough points in the past and it's still not entiely perfect.  The graphics aren't mind blowing.  The in game music basically has to be supplied by you running an old mechwarrior OST in the background.  The camos and paints are overpriced.  The cockpit items are cheesy and borerline immersion breaking.  The UI is inherently flawed.  The gameplay can be repetitive on certain maps.  The default keys and some of the game options are questionable.  Some of the warhorns can be headache inducing.  And the power level difference from a new mech to a ""mastered"" mech with modules and a custom build is a vast bottomless chasm.  However, it is fun.  The community is fantastic.  The in game chat is professional.  The devs do listen and are trying.  The redone maps are fantastic.  The selection of mechs is excellent.  The weapon and chassis balance is a lot better than it used to be.  The customisation is awesome.  The gameplay is tactical and skill based.  And finally the feeling you get from coring a mech with your last salvo while limping and with only one arm barely hanging on is unparalleled.  I have experienced some of my favourite gaming memories from this title and I don't regret a moment of it.  I have no doubt there are both positive and negative points about this title that I've failed to mention, hell, there's probably things I have never encountered having not played through the ""new player"" or f2p experience.  But I've had fun with it and if you're a fan of Battletech or of giant stompy robots in general then I'm sure you will too.  One more thing, if you're just getting into the game here are some basic tips:  Fight from the cockpit, unlock your arms, torso twist when you're reloading, use double heat sinks, assign left click = left arm, right click = right arm, side mouse buttons = torso weapons, press R to lock target, remap shift to full zoom, set your FOV to 0.75, concentrate fire, stick with the team and watch your heat.  With that all said, I hope you found this at least a little informative and it helps you out with deciding whether or not this is the game for you.  Good luck, Mechwarriors.			"

												Firstly, this game is not a Pay to Win. For more info, scroll down to the micro-transactions section.Mechwarrior Online is a game that (despite my hours on it so far via Steam) I have played since its open beta and friends I play with have played it since closed beta. In reality, I have around 1000 hours (maybe more, maybe less) on the game before its launch on Steam.This game has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs as well as a game that has seen huge changes. If you were to compare the open beta and my first match with the way the game is today, it is almost completely different.If you are looking for an honest review from an experienced mechwarrior fan (fan of the original battletech board games and of the older mechwarrior games) then look no further.------ GRAPHICS ------9/10The graphics for this game have always been on point, however at times this can cause PC problems if you do not have a decent setup. It is a graphically demanding game, make no mistake. The grahpics have seen huge improvements to not only how they look but their impact on the game.  The first wave of graphical overhauls saw outrage in the community due to the bugs and lag they caused (due to the high polygon count of the textures). This has been fixed for the most part but it is still demanding on the graphics side of things. I would recommend a GTX 650 (or AMD equivalent) or above for this kind of game if good graphics are a must for you.------ MOVEMENT/DISPLAY MECHANICS ------8/10The movement mechanics of this game are complex and different from most shooters. If you are not familiar with how to steer tanks and similar vehicles in other games, then it may be tricky to begin with. Mechs essentially work like tanks in this game in that your control the lower half of the mech with WASD and you control the upper half of your mech with your mouse. In terms of jumpjets (built in jetpack devices for some mechs, to allow them some extra movement options) are a keyboard feature. The mouse is simply for aiming with. There are also two view modes in the game: 3rd and 1st person. However you will need to know that you will be easier to see in 3rd person from the enemy's perspective. Due to 3rd person being enabled by a drone that hovers just above your mech, the enemy can see this and locate you with more ease.For both 1st and 3rd person, the crosshair is fluid and easily seen in every environment in the game.TIP: You may want to disable arm locking, as this will lock your arm movement with your torso movement - rectricting your firing arc.------ MECH BUILDING MECHANICS ------10/10The mech building mechanics of the game are like no other game I have played. For older fans of mechwarrior, this game replicates the older games (and the board games). For the newer fans, the cusomization can be confusing at first (especially with the UI) but with practice as well as the tutorials, you will get the hang of it.In this game you are able to customize the following:- Armour (for specific parts of your mech, i.e legs, arms, torso etc.)- Weapon Systems (lasers, cannons, machine guns, rockets etc.)- Engine Size (more powerful engines = faster mech) (XL engines are lighter however span across more of your mech, however they make you more vulnerable to being destroyed.)- Heat Sinks (for cooling systems)- Ammo Types- ECM (radar cloaking device), BAP (probe for countering ECM)- Jump Jets- Camo patterns (paint, colours etc. - however cosmetics cost money)And other equipment (too much to list everything)There are also four main types of mech:- Light Mech, main roles include Scouting, Locking Targets, Capturing Bases and support of heavier mechs. (really fast, really weak armour, low DPS)- Medium Mechs, main roles include support of heavier mechs, targeting light mechs, supporting light mechs. (moderately fast, average armour, average DPS)- Heavy Mechs, main roles include support of assault mechs, targeting medium mechs, dealing damage. (slow, above average armour, above average DPS)- Assult Mechs, main roles include leading a front of mechs, absorbing damage, dealing damage, need to be supported. (very slow, heavy armour, high DPS)There are two main categories of mech:- Inner Sphere- Clan MechsInner sphere clan mechs tend to be more robust whereas clan mechs can be brittle in comparison (depending on the mech). However Clan mechs have more powerful weaponry compared to Inner sphere. That said, Clan mechs tend to be the more favoured of the two but I am an Inner Sphere, light mech pilot.In terms of the mechs themselves, Inner sphere tend to have better light mechs and the clans tend to have better assult mechs. The heavies and mediums being around the same.The best part of all this is that it is true to the lore.------ MICROTRANSACTIONS ------5/10The microtransations are soemthing that have always been argued about since the game's launch. Most of the cosmetic features will require you to spend real money. To own a vast collection of mechs, you need mech bays - which cost money (however you get four free mech bays to start out). Some mechs can only be bought with real money, however these mechs do not give you any advantage in a fight - they just provide you with better bonuses (such as more in game money and more XP). You can also purchase mech packages, for a collection of new mechs that come with mech bays.This game is NOT A PAY TO WIN.If you decide to spend money on this FREE game, you will simply skip the grind of saving in game money to buy your own mechs. I have played well over 1000 hours before it went onto Steam and only spent money on a few more mech bays and one mech.THERE IS NO DLC.All the maps and extra content added to the game are not DLC packs, they are added to the core game. The mechs added to the game will always have varients you can buy with in game cash. Generally, new mechs are released and for the first few months you can only aquire them via real money. After these few months, in game money varients are released for you to buy.------ ADVANCEMENT ------7/10The game's grinding system can be tedious after a while but is not as long as some other games I have played (such as RPG MMOs). The grind will not be really easy but it is not so bad that you cannot get anywhere - it just takes a little time. You can put money in to skip this grind but it usually does not take long to earn enough in game money for your first mech.The only downside is the mech bays, as you only start with four.------ SERVERS ------8/10The servers are generally quite good and do not suffer lag now as much as they did. They have dedicated servers in the EU, US and in Oceania. Meaning no matter where you are in the world, there will be a server with a decent latency for your to join. You can switch where you are playing via the main hub screen.------ USER INTERFACE ------6/10The user interface is a part of the game that has seen massive changes. In my own opinion, the oldest UI and original UI was the best in terms of layout as it was not complex or confusing. However the new UI is more fluid, is nt as buggy as the older UI at the cost that it is more complex than the old UI.If you are a new player, it can be confusing at first but not too bad to get the hang of. If you are a returning player, it will be like a different game.------ MAPS/ENVIRONMENTS ------In the beginning, the maps were few but the quality was high. As time went on more maps were added into the map pools and (you'll be pleased to know, they do not require additonal DLC). With the advancement in graphical technology in computing and gaming in general, the older maps have been reimagined and re-released with an even higher quality than before. You'll find yourself fighting on desert planet mech scrapyyards to swampy, steamy bogs and on moon bases in outer space.I ran outta space, GG steam!			"

You will never make it back alive if you're going to play solo.Requires a good graphics card to play or you'll be missing out on the details and the crappy render distance, so you'll always be shooting at walls but you won't know because its too far and not rendered yet.

												Fun game, much improved since a last played a few years ago. Only complaints I have is that I havent noticed any new maps and with the map voting system there are some maps that I simply never get to play on, PGI should keep track of this and rework/replace the unwanted maps and match types. Also, faction play takes FOREVER to queue. I wish there was a single player or PVE campaign just something that didnt take 30 mintues just to get to the 60 second countdown to enter a match,the constant waiting makes grinding C-bills a pain.

												Giant stompy robots. What more do you need?Fair warning: the new player learning curve in this game is steep. Like 90 degree steep. Do yourself a favor and DO THE TUTORIALS. Run them until you're very familiar with how to handle yourself. You don't want to start a match off and get stuck running into a wall, getting you butt shott off, because you don't know to move your legs independantly from your torso. Once you've mastered the basics then hop in and get ready to be shot up to pieces. You're probably going to lose right away - or at least get blasted pretty quick. Like I said, the learning curve is a wall. But if you can push through your initial deathfest and learn a few things in the process you might just have what it takes to start racking up the kills yourself.This game is also F2P, and as far as free-to-play games go this one is pretty forgiving. The ONLY things you cannot purchase with game-grinded monies are additional mech bays (you start with 4), and Hero Mechs (honestly, nothing special. Just different varients of a chassis, none of which are amazing.) However, between monthly (or bi-monthly) events, contests, competitions and whatnot you can earn premium moneyz to buy those things, or earn them outright. So yeah. It's pretty forgiving.That all said, I've spent over $200 on this ""free"" game. FML.			"

												I have a full time job, 2 kids, a wife, and other responsibilities... I still find the time to get in 11.5 hrs in 2 weeks.  I know that doesn't sound like a lot but for someone who plays maybe an hour a week on a good week...It is also worth note that this game does have a learning curve, and tier 5 is full of derptastic derpdom and things like friendly fire, but on the whole I have seen it as having one of the least toxic, albeit at time salty as hell, communities I've been apart of in a while.  As a rough rule people are willing to teach and learn... though more use of the coms would be nice.Great game, loads of potential, and hopefully will continue to move forward in a similar track. I love this game, it is fantastic, and while the packs here are garbage, even on 20% sale, it is well worth starting and if you want to sink in some money often you end up going straight to the source.

												Generally speaking it is a fun game to try after looking for some tutorial and vastly improved since CBT (I'm a founder pack buyer)However, even though I recommend it, I would need to point out that this is only if you play SOLO or in large organized group preferably in 12. I have to teach my friends either through video or private matches...and forced to REFUSE teamming up with them so that they will have a better experience and time to enjoy rather than being stomped by 12-men team.Why? because, if you ever want to play with even just one friend, you will be dropped into the group queue and has to bear with the very likelihood of being steamrolled by a bigger premade group (a bunch of 2-4 mech teams vs an organized 12 mech team is quite common). and I have no idea why PGI still had not allow a 2 mech team in 'solo' queue as I failed to see, contrary to those forumites, how it will make the game unfair. See, WOT, WT and many other online session based games are allowing 2-4 men platoon, they don't have any problem with that.2 men team = 1/6 of a full team for MWO (16.7%)3 tanks = 1/5 of a full team for WOT and others (20%)And just throw the 4-12 mech teams to CW (even though people crying that it has long MM and whatever things they dislike). They don't belong to pub games. Or just get rid of large teams and make a cap for Lance-sized (4 mechs) premade queue. You will want to allow veterans to bring in and teach their friends rather than giving those people a hard time to do so, so that you will have enough population to support Community Warfare and larger group queue. (and everyone will be happier other than the 12-mech seal clubbing jerks)			"

												Mechwarrior Online has been a regularly played game of mine for 3 1/2 years now.  I enjoy it because the mech customization and uniqueness is very good and that translates into many different potential play-styles. I continue to play because it is a game that still has the ability to give me an adrenaline rush and white-knuckle game-play occasionally on those close or come-from-behind matches.  It is a tactical shooter and rewards a good sense of awareness and the ability to work as a team.Community Warfare is fun, although there isn't much of a lasting effect of winning or losing a Community Warfare match, but that system is being continuously worked on and there are some big changes being made that will improve the system.  I recommend this game if you prefer a more tactical, unit-based shooter where you generally must work together with others to be most effective.			"

The mech lab is a game in and of itself and I enjoy outfitting my mechs to meet whatever game mode I am going to play. This game has a strong focus on team play. That's not to say you can't jump in a quick game and have fun, but if you run off by yourself most likely you will get smashed. Stay with your team and communicate.I recommend this game to any Mechwarrior fan, or anyone who likes simulation type games.			"

												""Who is Piranha Games?""8 out of 10 Tell your friends Mechwarrior Online is live!-----Skip the first two paragraphs if you just want to learn about the game play.When I first tried it in 2013 I felt a nostalgic tug for the game Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries that I used to play. I lost interest for reasons. But I do recall the game felt like it was missing a lot of mechs.A year later I turned the game back on and found the developers, Piranha Games, has been busy adding content and even a whole new series of game play modes related to the Inner Sphere and Clan factions and taking place on a star map of the inner sphere. If you're a fan of the Mechwarrior games you'll like MWO. It turns out Piranha Games has been busy on MWO since 2011!If you're not a seasoned Mechwarrior expect a steep learning curve, the game is very strategic. Then expect long periods of learning. One fast huge tip -- Don't sell anything ... keep all the stuff you get because you'll want it later. Just keep increasing your C-bill worth. Every piece of equipment is c-bills you dont need to spend later for a laser and can go to a new mech chassis. If you save up and buy a mech, don't sell it, or the parts that came with it. It will really pay off after you own your first few mechs and want to change them up a bit. The game itself is a multiplayer Omnimech, Battlemech, Mechwarrior 12v12 (first person or third) with 2 modes, Quickplay and Clan Warfare. There are three game types for Quickplay mode. Skirmish, a team battle - last mech standing. Conquest, there are multiple points on the map which teams must capture to earn victory points. Assault, when the teams can capture a single base to win the game. In any Mechwarrior Online match the game is won when all enemies have been killed.The second gameplay mode is Clan Warfare. This mode puts the mechwarrior in the front seat of a battle on a galactic scale. Incorporating a star map of the inner sphere, players can battle to gain territory or defend what they have. Players must choose allegiance to a faction (Innersphere houses or Clan). The mechs you can select and play in Clan Warfare mode depend on your faction. For Clan factions, only clan mechs will be available, same for IS factions. Players can then select the star planet they wish to attack (or defend). Depending on the status of the contested planet different game scenarios can play out. Players might find themselves ""Holding ground"" on a recently conquered enemy territory, in this case an attack mission has become a defense mission. Eventually, if your faction persists and succeeds, the planet will be converted to your faction's territory. The starmap changes over time as different factions gain/lose territory.Add up to twelve of your friends to a unit and smash the opposition. This game features automatic matchmaking and in-game voice communication on par with other popular games. The game has a great ""Play for Free"" model. You can become a powerful and rich mechwarrior with out spending money and eventually will unlock items that cost money for free in special events held frequently.EDIT---------September 15, 2016After having this game on my computer for years and now steam for almost a year, I have to say, it is on the list of my favorite games. Coming back to it and comparing it to when I started playing in 2013 isn't even fair. This has become a whole new game, better, faster, more versatile -- more fun! This is the Mechwarrior game you've been dreaming of since the late 90's.			"

												Definitely a good game to get into if you're into Mech combat. While not exactly a fast pace game, there are moments of all out slug fests when head to head engagement over a point become inevitable. This game comes in second place just under Mech Warrior: Living Legends mod, only because that mod allowed the use of air units and tanks along side mechs. There is the issue of expensive mechs, and I agree the prices for them are pretty steep and the grind for them is tedious. However when it comes to mechs it isn't about having many, but mastering the one you own. A light mech can just as easily out manuever and harrass the heavy tonnage mechs. Though the risk is there for being outright killed if they get a shot on you. They do a good job at immersing you into a battle as well, with game rounds starting with your pilot doing a systems check in a drop pod into a battlefield.			"

												I, personally, love this game. Take a look at that word there, ""personally"".I say that because this game isn't for everyone. It's not CoD, it's not Battlefield, it's not even Hawken. It's a robot simulator with 30+ years of Lore, books, and other games behind it. It's slow, it's grindy (when leveling up new mechs, when you choose to do that), it's got it's own share of problems constantly popping up, or constantly being fixed and hammered out.Don't come in to MW:O looking for your next singleplayer robot game, or come in expecting to kill everyone forever, or expecting your robots to fly around the maps while doing backflips.Come into this game looking for a unique, fun, slower paced game. Come into MW:O looking for kick♥♥♥♥♥robot battles, missiles flying overhead, lasers everywhere. Come for the giant land-slide games where you and your team crushes 12 other robots into the ground with giant guns... stay for the games that drag on. Stay for the games that come down to the wire, with a panicking Light mech falling apart while darting around the map to spot the last few guys on the other team, so your last few nearly-exploded friendly mechs don't walk into a trap. Stay for the games where you're the last-mech-standing on your team, going full Rambo on the last lance of enemy mechs.Yes, the game has its flaws, but it's a free-2-play game that's actually fair and paying money gives no in-combat advantage. Give it a try, just understand this isn't your average robot shoot-em-up.			"

												QUICK REVIEW:If you're looking for a fast paced FPS mech shooter this isn't the game for you. STOP READING If you enjoy teamwork and stratagy focused game with some simulation elements this is the game you been looking for! Cont. reading...It's a great fun game once you grasp it! I've played it off and on for 3 years. It requires good communication, situational awareness, and methodical thinking. ADVICE:My advice use the tutorial and practice in the Mech Academy and the Mech Lab for the first few days. Look at the controls and button mappings. Try out different Trial Mechs BEFORE YOU BLOW YOUR CADET AND TRAINING BONUS! Think of your play style check out the guides on YouTube, in the forums, and here http://mwomercs.com/game then buy and build your mech. The game does have grind that is curved by spending money after all it is the F2P model. But if you follow the advice above the grind won't be so bad because you didn't jump the gun and buy the wrong mech before you found your play style. PROS/CONS:Pros:-Solid gameplay -Robots-3D cockpits -Customization -Hard Working Dev Team-Continually updated product-Never ending updated mech roster coming to the game Cons:-Steep learning curve-Not as new player friendly -Lacks Campaign / Co-OpINFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW:Features to being worked on / added:-Comunity Warfare phase 3-Single / Co-Op Campaign -Decal mech customization -More balance passes (these won't ever stop) -VR HTC Vibe and Oculus Rift support -Map and model updates and makeovers (Ongoning process) -Dynamic Weather in gameThings being considered TBD:-CryEngine Update and DX12-Collisions (Knockdowns / Physics) "

												I've loved MechWarrior ever since MechWarrior 2 back in the day. MWO improves much of the gameplay aspects (espectially the multiplayer balance) over the past games, and despite other big name shooters - Titanfall, Battlefield, Battlefront - I still come back to MWO. There is no other equivalent to customizing your mech, taking into account each chassis' quirks, weapon types and equipment, and having that all play out in real time during a match. For instance, did you store ammo in your leg? Well, if someone strips your leg armor, there's a chance that the ammo will explode and take your leg with it. How about a heat sink instead? On certain maps, there are large pools of water; submerging your legs in them will make those heat sinks work more efficiently. On top of all this, you can pick your opponents apart piece by piece; or opt to try and core them out and take them down as quickly as possible.Now, the drawbacks: Visually, the mech designs are awesome (and by far the best this franchise has seen). However, the actual art direction (coloring, textures, map design) are only just adequate. Colors are often over-saturated, bloom is used too much, and texture resolution is hit and miss (mostly due to the complexity of having so many patterns and giant vehicles to cover, which can wreak havoc on install size if not toned down). The other drawback is the lack of a single-player component, which is probably my favorite part of the series. The devs have it as a future goal (and have started to implement AI) but it will likely be a year before we see the beginnings of that coming to fruition.Overall, I've sunk more hours into this game than any other in recent memory, so if you've got a stompy robot addiction like me, then this should provide your fix. Plus it's free and has no equivalent to 'gold ammo' or other pay2win mechanics (hero mechs generally range from terrible to just ok, anyway) so there's no hurt in giving it a try. Just be sure to go through the Mechwarrior Academy training mode first.			"

												Ladies & Gentlemen, boys & girls.  - This here isn't your average run of the mill game, and the amount of hatred & white-knighting is immense, when it comes to this game. - Where does the great divide stem from?- The Former Publisher IGP's calls of pushing PGI around. Right after IGP left the scene and PGI took over as a Publisher... everything changed. - Within 6 months, Community Warfare Beta Phase 1 was released. By now, in around two years PGI has took the 'nigh toxic community by the horns. Cleared the air, voiced concerns & opinions. This sounds more like a company that loves its community, instead of whines for more money, like it originally was.- Was I about to abandon ship when IGP was around? I seriously was. I would be raging here with the negative feedbacks along with the rest of 'em.After PGI bought the publishing rights from IGP, everything changed:PGI is fixing the game, a milestone at a time, and thus far... it has delivered. +100 mechs & variants, and they all feel different. - This alone, is quite a feat to accomplish. The core of the game is 'nigh rock-solid. Extra content is on its way for 2016 to bring first vehicles for the game as well.***Everything in the game can be bought with in-game money, including basic colors.- Events are held where you can get free Mech Bays.- Anything that you can buy with money, won't give you an advantage.- Grinding is a lot smaller in part in comparison to most f2p games, though getting C-Bills(in game currency) fast is mostly up to your pilot talent.- What is in major part is the simulation, and finding the right role for your talents.Best community in TS Servers I've thus far met. Also, the most mature & the most aged in general.- This isn't for those energy drink whopping, twitch shooter friends who crave for their next fix.This is for us, who require a blend of wisdom/tactical thinking, and strategy, while commandeering a role that will either make the team, or break the team.- Teamplay is the key word, so think wisely... This game is unlike any other simulator out there. Keep a cool hat and see only after 25 matches how things go. 5-10 rounds won't get you nowhere(you just might thank me later).There's also a lot of great youtube videos out there to help you get acquinted with various roles, weight classes & ""How To Build Your Mech"" kind of schematics.And one more thing: www.sarna.net ||| Use the Search, this is your IMDB of Mechs & Battletech history, including weaponry & what they are primarily used for.

												Hello everybody. I write this review as a fan of Battletech, MechWarrior in particular, and as an MWO player since late closed beta. According to the stats page of the game, I have spent 205 hours in-matches. Note that this does not include Community Warfare matches which should be roughly another 30 hours and tinkering with mechs inside the mechlab or one of the many player-made mechlabs available on the web. The money invested into this F2P title is around 70 dollars which includes the Hunchback IIC package (40$) and a few other MC (MechWarrior Credits, the IRL money currency in-game) transactions for hero mechs, premium time and colors. I primarily play as a Heavy pilot, with a few choice Assault and Medium mechs. I am also a Tier 2 rating, so I like to think I have an O.K. understanding of the game and it’s Meta. All these things may have colored my perception of the game and the experience it offers.The Good:-Unique gameplay that seems to be underrepresented in today’s market-Vastly improved controls over its predecessors-Complex and meaningful customisation (MechLab)-A mostly mature community that is supportive and enjoys explaining their passion about stompy robots-A great selection of mechs with varied play styles. This game has so many of them, there will be one for you. During the writing of this review 12/9/2015, most mechs are in a good spot with some underpowered exceptions.  The most recent balance patch was on 12/1/2015 so the new meta has yet to solidify.The Neutral:-Starting Trial mechs are a mixed bag. Try all of them-Steep learning curve-Lacking in-depth tutorial about most important part of the game (MechLab and Mech Customisation)-Runs on CryEngine and has performance issues on weak CPU’s. Recommend lowering “Particle” setting-A fair selection of maps, but could use more. Maps also vary in quality-Owning 4 mechs of each chassis allows you to “Elite” your pilot with the chassis, used to grant you considerable buffs. Those buffs were since nerfed hard, but are still noticeable. Investing in a mech chassis you enjoy is still recommended and somewhat expensive- Mech Upgrades are expensive, required for competitive play and are NOT factored in the initial mech buy price (hidden costs). Same goes for different engines ratings or engine types. It may look like Light Mechs are the cheapest but a competitive Light Mech can run you the price of a Competitive Assault Mech (hidden costs)-All new mechs release in a Pre-Order Pack model, where the mech becomes available for those who pre-order, a month later it releases of MC and a month later for in-game CBills-Community Warfare technically no entry requirement, but having 4 custom mechs is highly recommended-Performance based economy. As in any game, you probably won’t be amazing at it right away. The game can be somewhat grindy between your first and second mech. However, once you perform well consistently, the money will be flowing in.-Controversy around developer and their practises-Community Warfare lacks a matchmaker. It’s considered the “hard core” mode where people play with their units!The Bad:-Limited base game modes .Quick Play only has TDM with a base, pure TDM or Conquest. Community Warfare features an asymmetrical Attack/Defend mode with turrets and dropships that let you deploy up to 4 of you mechs (Each mech acts a as a life) as well as a TDM mode where the invader team defends the destroyed base from a counter attack. That’s it until a new “scouting” mode drops sometime next month.-Signature game mode Community Warfare has low population on off-hours and work days (This may change with steam release)-Somewhat slow development rate on big features. However, there are 2 patches per month and fast hot fixes (even on weekends).-Hit or miss balance patches-Minefield of an in-game store. Somewhat expensive too! Please research a Hero Mech before purchasing, not all of them are good!Overall, the game is solid enough to warrant a download. Most importantly, even if I find it somewhat stale nowadays, it has a way of being FUN. Try it out, but it’s not for everybody. Look up some of the excellent player guides and resources.I recommend visiting www.reddit.com/r/outreachHPG it has a great player resource selection. MechWarrior has a passionate community that are willing to help out new players. It might be overwhelming at first, but this game can grow on you easily.			"

												Mechwarrior Online continues the tradition of a proud franchise. This is a sim-light shooter that maintains all the greatness of the previous versions while also providing a fantastic community of people to play with in a simulated galactic war that, while still in development, is shaping up to be a very unique experience.Most importantly this ""freemium"" game has a very reasonable grind and practically no ""pay to win"" elements. The Hero mechs are a nice way to ease the grind, but after playing 2 years I can honestly say that most of my best mechs were purchased with the in-game currency - ""C-Bills"", which are earned by simply playing the game. There is no ""gold ammo"" or any other such pay to win devices here. The only thing that costs money that is essential are mech-bays, but these are frequently rewarded in weekend spanning ""events"" that offer many prizes for scoring ""points"" for game play. Many of these prizes are ""real money"" items and PGI has proven very generous. That's not to say that there isn't a reason to spend money. There is plenty of ""swag"" that can be purchased to deck out your favorite mechs, such as - War Horns, Camo Patterns, Paints and cockpit items. You can also purchase mech packs or if you want the hot new thing, you can pay for early access to new mechs before they are available for C-Bills. Last but most importantly there is ""premium time"" which increases the XP and C-bills earned during matches. This decreases the grind and when coupled with Hero 'Mechs practically removes the grind completely. I have spent more money on this game than any other in my life, and I will continue to do so, simply because I don't feel I have to.. There is no extortion here, no ""pay to win"". The grind is hardly a grind at all. If you enjoy playing the game, forget about your bank account and check on it occassionally and be surprised by how fast it grows.To sum up, MWO is perhaps the best ""free to play"" game on the market. It hits that perfect balance of ""free"" and ""grind"" without aggravating ""pay to win"" mechanics. I have been playing it solidly for over 2 years now and still play it more than any other game I own. Be warned though. The learning curve here is very steep (2-3 months). Don't be surprised if you go a week before getting a legitmate kill. But in return MWO offers an incredibly deep and diverse ""thinking man's shooter"" experience unlike any other.			"

												I highly recommend this game. 6400 drops and I'm still having fun.My Favourite Parts:- piloting a giant stompy robot with a customized load-out of lasers, missiles and canons- teamwork is very important- able to group up with my brother and real-life friends and have a good time battling it out online.- met lots of cool people through the in-game ""Units"" (like a guild or clan in other games)- seriously... teamwork, explosions, cannons. I don't know what more you want in a mech game!- here's a good example of a really fun match. It was a come-from-behind victory:

												Even though I never was involved in the tabletop games and have zero clue about the lore behind the MechWarrior franchise, I've always been a fan of the MechWarrior games throughout the years on PC.  I came into MWO pretty late in the game, having started playing in March 2015, and have no clue how it released and slipped under my gaming radar, but totally love the game.   It appeals to a certain type of gamer outside of the lore fanatics, as it isn't your fast paced COD like game that appeals to the ADD crowd.  Give it a try, run the trial Mechs, and judge for yourself after throwing a few hours into it.  All you'll lose if you don't like is a little bit of time, but if you do like it you'll gain a solid title in your Steam library that you'll keep coming back to.			"

												I have been playing since the open beta in 2012. I'm still playing it. Why?It's a lot of fun.It is as simple or as complex as you wish to make it.  You want simple? You can run around using default loadouts not caring where you shoot. In that sense it is 'just glorified deathmatch in giant robots' You want complex? Use targeting information to find weak spots on enemy mechs. Make tactical decisions about whether to destroy an arm or a side torso that contains the most dangerous weapons on your opponent before finishing them off,or go straight for the kill through their heavily-armoured centre torso section. (Or maybe, if you think they might have an XL engine, go for a less-protected side torso first and get a quicker kill).Pilot nimble, lightly-armed mechs or massive lumbering weapon-laden assaults. Learn which tactics work for each mech class and each weapon, on each map.Spend hours in the mechlab customising mechs with the balance of speed, armour and weapons that suit your playstyle.-These latter points are what lays the foundation of the game's claim to being 'the thinking man's shooter'.It's also possible to do all of this  without investing a penny , but you have to invest the time to earn the money to buy what you want. Personally, I have paid around £60 over the 3 years, which for the amount of hours of fun I have got out of the game beats the value of almost all the AAA titles I own. The main reason I paid money was to show support for the game, so that it carries on being developed and played, not because there was something behind a paywall that I desperately needed.Try it out. If you have never played a mechwarrior game make sure you play the tutorial!			"

But for an online fast paced action packed Mech game... this is bad♥♥♥♥♥ Definetly worth playing. Click PLAY, give it a shot with your a free trial mech, grab the huge C-Bill increase for newbies (1st 25 matches) then buy whatever mech you want.

												So... I don't like FPS games in general. Hey - come to think of it, I barely like any games.But, I like this one. I've played it for nearly two years, practically every day.Two reasons: 1) You are part of a team.Sometime your team is a blessing, sometime it's a curse. The game is unforgiving and does not keep tabs - make the wrong choice of 'mech or loadout, forget about where the team is and what they're doing, play in a match of random players doing all kinds of funny (bad) stuff - one misstake (yours or a team mate's) and you're out. Cry and moan every way you want about the outcome of the match or the performance of your team, but there's always something YOU could have done better  or better communicated with someone else about. Every now and again you have nothing to do with the outcome of a match - learn to live with it!2) It's Battletech(tm).Yes - It lacks some of the elements seen in previous titles in the franchise. It also is better than previous titles at other things. The last year, I've seen improvements in development I never would have thought possible when I started playing. There's also a lot of great improvements in the roadmaps, which I hope will adress many of the current shortcomings.I know many care about what have been and what will come. Me, I just play the hand I was dealt - Adopt, and have fun.			"

												I have been playing this game since before it ever came to Steam. It is very well done, and any MechWarrior fan will be pleased. They have added a lot in recent years, and continue to do so. This game is far from ""Pay to win"" since custom design mechs don't replace skill all that well, and most stuff in the game can be bought through winning and participating in matches. Stunning visuals back a long established mech destruction game that brings back the same feelings I had with the series.			"

												I have over 300 hours in-game on Mechwarrior Online and probably another 400 hours in-game on Mechlab Online. I have been playing Mechwarrior Franchise since Mechwarrior 2, also playing the Battletech CCG.  Love it all, always have.  This game is a great change of pace from any other FPS on the market.  Different guns, different armor, different speeds and different mechs.  It is sweet.  Will continue to support the game.For a starter or newbie this make take awhile to get into, the game is definitely a grinding game, or if your wallet is deep enough.  I don't have an issue with the pay vs grinding.The Pilot Tier system is a little odd just because it takes forever to rank up, but that is expected.To anyone new I highly recommend Clan mechs over Inner Sphere, at one point I had a full IS mechlab and now stricly Clan mechs only.  players choice but Clan is awesome.

												The core game play experience is well worth people trying it out and seeing for themselves if they like it or not.  The game is fun and deep compared to many other games out in the F2P space and well worth the time of anyone to download for free and try it out to see if they like it or not. Particularly of note for those that do play other F2P games that will make this game more appealing: - No tier system.  If you grind your cadet bonus' in trial mechs, by the end of your cadet period you can buy literally any non-pre-order mech in the game to start out with. - No golden ammo or boosters that directly affect the game matches. (Only booster is premium time that boosts earnings and experience grind. - In general no P2W mechs.  The ""hero"" mechs are fairly different but not inherently better then their counterparts. (No boosted weapon damage etc.) And the company sells mech packs under a ""pre-order"" moetization system that as a generalization isn't pay to win.  Full disclosure though, every now and then one or two mechs defiantly creeps over the power scale before being nerfed leading up to a more general release. But for every mech that tends to break this curb on release ends up being about 3-4 mechs that are either mediocre or under-powered during their pre-order access and are buffed at a later time so it does even out in the grand scheme of things.The game isn't perfect, but trying it out for yourself and let you form your own opinion of it. Its good enough to at least give it a try on your own. Of particular note is that MWO has been getting better with every patch, and in particular the past year of development has really stepped up the pace when it comes to meaningful changes made to the game.  If they continue the pace of development they have been maintaining up to this point, the game will only get better in the long run.			"

												Mechwarrior has been a fantastic series of games, but in the past, the multiplayer options never even began to capture the feel of the old pen and paper.  It was always a race to the top.  Run the biggest mech or die!MWO has fixed that.  This is a tactics game.  This is a game where how you play your role is REWARDING.  This is a game where two large teams enter, but every player counts.And this game rewards you for finding your favorite balance of speed, armor, firepower, and battle field enduance (heat and quantity of ammo).This is a game about trading blows, taking risks, and defining the envelope.And the best thing about this game, is it truly is free to play.  The light mechs are cheap, but POWERFUL in skilled hands.  The medium mechs are affordable and are the standard battlefield units.  The expensive assault, though expansive, may have a role to play, and are worth every penny, but they do NOT own the battlefield.And every patch rewards people who play their role more and more.I am a freelance mercenary.  I am not a part of a unit, I do not use team speak, I am a pug player, and I still thrive in Community Warefare.I cannot say how amazing this game is.  It is amazing, it has been amazing, and every month, more and more value is added to the game.DOWNLOAD IT!!!! You cannot lose if you get it for free, so what are you wating for?!			"

												After taking the Mechwarrior Franchise, making unfulfillable promises, and shoveling out constant microtransaction laden content, its no wonder that MWO has hurt fans of the franchise.  Grinding for mechs takes forever, and once you fill the very limited number of mech bays on your account, youre left with either not growing your hangar or shelling out money for the opportunity to grind even more and purchase other mechs.  While occassionally fun, PGI has massively mishandled the game and lost out on an opportunity to make something special.  Long time fans will enjoy the gameplay, but find the grind tedious and unrewarding without spending money.			"

Once you get past the steep learning curve (which should be easier now, thanks to the Training Academy) it's a lot of fun.It's got flaws, sure, and balance will always be an issue, but even most of the bittervets would agree that the core gameplay is good.

												What a Gem.I have to admit i was a bit sceptical running around in robots over using a marine type toon. But the gamplays great. Its got loads of depth too, there must be hundreds of machines and 1000's of load outs/ways to equip your tin can/mech. Mature loyal game following too. This is a FPS that is not too heavy on your PC too but that doesnt take away from great gameplay. Games at first are bit like hide and seek but when you get in front of your target you either got to have back up or hope your mech's set up can dish out more DPS than the other guy because it can be over in seconds.Also you can get into games very quickly compared to others in this genre. One of the things that i really liked is that even as a noob you can have value on map. If you pick a trial mech that has one preferably 2 AMS (anti missile system) hard points on it you can offer anti missile defence to your team mates, just by standing near them, as your learning the game by watching others.Also for a free to play! you can earn alot of in game cash at the beginning  so you can try out different tin cans/ robots and find your own style of play. Dont be like me though, play tutorial and first 25 games before you actually buy anthing in game (its about 500k a game which is enough to get you going), thats what  the forums said and its true.With about 10 free mechs you should play these because it will take you a while to actually work out what to buy. Its best to find out the best style of game for you be it machine guns or LRMs/missiles/lasers etc or 5 different classes of Mechs. Its got Faction warfare too, that takes the strategy and depth of the game to new level, I have not really got  into that just yet but the player base is friendly and solid. This franchise has been around for years but its been a well kept secret!			"

												I've been a Mechwarrior fan for over 20 years, and have been playing MWO since just after it started (missed the founders packages). I still don't get bored with it, even with the limited progress in game modes. I currently own over 100 mechs.Note to new players:- The main ""whiners"" on the MWO forums are people who refuse to join a unit- You should join a unit- there are many that are very casual- ""Pugging"" or playing solo in this game can be rough... so maybe don't?- Join a unit, get advice from long time players, and have fun destroying stuff in big stompy robits.

Posted: December 10, 2015
												It may not look like it, as it's new on Steam - but after hundreds of hours in this game I can safely say it's one I heartily recommend.Not recommend without reservation, mind, but heartily reccomend.The game is difficult.  Screamingly difficult.  The learning curve is steep, mostly because it's unlike any other shooter out there.  It moves like World of Tanks, but plays slower, and with near infinite customizeability.  When you die, you're out of the round - no respawns in quick play, and a new mech in Community Warfare.  Ammo matters - you can't resupply, there are no 'pickups' or in-game mods that matter.  Taking damage matters - you don't repair in a match, can can lose entire sections of your mech or just a gun here and there as you are beaten by enemy fire.Your environment matters - how hot is the world you're on?  Can you stand in water to help disssapate heat? Can you see your enemies, or will the ground clutter make targetting difficult?Your teamwork matters.  No one's rambo here - your mech has hard limitations that mean you simply cannot win a game by yourself.  You can customize every mech - mechs can suit your playstyle and loadouts are up to you, from engines to capabilities, with no real 'best'.It's fantastic.  A ""thinking man's shooter"" indeed, where every decision has consequences that can be extremely far-reaching for a match.  Signal intelligence matters.  Knowledge matters.  Skill matters.  Make the learning curve and you'll have near infinite permutations to experiment with.  Hell, put on a different weight class and learn how to play an entirely different game with the same parameters.The downside?  There are two solid gamemodes, with only a handful of objectives.  While this will expand (and it's going to take a while for them to feel stale), it's currently somewhat limited.  The initial learning curve is a cliff - it's not an easy entry, though the new tutorial helps a great deal.All in all, though?  It's a fantastic experience, one that gives a great deal of reward to those that can get over the initial learning curve.			"

												A little background on my MechWarrior Online (MWO) experience:    Joined MWO community on November 3, 2011.    Closed Beta Tester starting in late May 2012.    Broadcasting MWO exclusively on Twitch since October 2012.I know this sounds like bragging, but I want to be clear on how much I love this game. Is it perfect? Nope. Does it have a steep learning curve? Kind of, but it really depends on your previous experience with MechWarrior/Tank games. But it is very fun to play once you get the hang of things.The graphics are good. Especially if you have a good processor and graphics card. The sounds are well done and help with the immersion. The game maps are fun for the most part (PGI is in the process of rebuilding older maps) and everyone has their favorites and most hated maps (Caustic Valley is my least favorite). The Quick Match game modes are OK and currently don't have a lot of variation in how they are played due to people being stuck in their ways, but there is enough variation to keep things interesting. Usually. I suggest you stick with the Solo Queue until you are more comfortable with the game as the Group Queue tends to be a little more competitive.Faction play (aka Community Warfare (CW)) is still in development and can be fun, but right now it is really only a game mode where you get four lives instead of one. I highly suggest a new player avoid CW until they are more experienced because it is considered to be ""hardcore mode"" and you will be put up against some of the better players and their friends.The community can be very helpful and I strongly encourage you to check out the Twitch streams as the broadcasters and viewers are usually very knowledgeable and eager to help new players.If you love big stompy robots blowing up other big stompy robots, give it a try, visit the Twitch streams, and ask questions.Good luck and send me a friend invite ingame. I'd be more than happy to help you out. Gimpy			"

												It's improved since I stopped playing over a year ago, but not by much. It still runs the horrible UI.It still seems like a non stop push for cash. Constantly releasing packs of mechs without much other improvements.It's painful after having spent over $600 on mech packs and credits to constantly have more mechs shoved into your face without any improvments to the base game.

												This game is like mustard: -There are people who hate it while others who love it. It all depends on what you personally enjoy.- It takes a while to get used to so dont get discouraged if it leaves a bad taste after a while for it does get better with  repetition and experience. (steep learning curve)Pros:- It's free so you wont lose anything if you give it a try.- No pay to win through added steroids and costly rare seeds.- Many and continued improvements throughout the years- Enjoyable and clean game play- Plays best when accompanied by other helpful entities (TEAMWORK and friends)- Many play styles to choose from like up close and personal or support (I like my mustard off to the side)- Occasional free items through eating contests- Many varieties to choose from (mech variants)- Friendly community of enthusiastsCons:- Lack of teamwork will make the game sour and spoil the experiance - Stains carpet- Pay for branding (colors/camo/aesthetics)- Some minor ingredient imbalances but nothing really worth throwing it out over- Learning what play style you enjoy EARLY in game given limited starting resources can be frustratingFinal thoughts: I dont really see this game as much of a grinding type game due to the enjoyment i get out of it. Given that, either you will enjoy it or you wont. I find this game relaxing and fun to play, plus it's free which is just an added bonus and gives ME an incentive to help the developers through in game purchases such as camo, colors, warhorns or to obtain mechs sooner. Not like other twitch FPS but requires thought and stradegy given lots of different variables.There is a lot to learn so do the tutorial and look up mechspecs to help you out and then fine tweak it to your play style.  I sucked at this game at first but at least give 10hrs(?) of play time to develop an understanding of game play mechanisms and tactics before leaving the community which may be hard to ask for someone to do.

												I'm not sure if I can fully recommend this game especially newer players from steam. veteren players will constantly verbally assault newer players because of their lack of skill which also brings up the fact that they need a playlist for newer players to get adjusted. Before there was no tutorial good enough to prepare you for the brutal multiplayer where veterans would slaughter new players often turning them away from the game. They have a new tutorial which teacher you mmuch needed info but still not enough to just thrust you into hell. I had played this game before it came to steam and decided to bring along a friend and teach him how to play but he quickly stopped playing after three matches of toxic players calling him trash and to uninstall the game even with warning to these players that he was newer and its to be expected especially with the games terrible tutorial at the time. The gameplay is solid and exciting for sure. If you have assistance breaking the learning curve and have friends that you can communicate with you will have a much better experience like most games.One final complaint is the horrid grind to ""master"" specific mechs and the game often puts you in uncomfortable positions grinding out currency to pay for varients of the mech you want.I would recommend this game but its to steep of a curve for new players mixed with the toxicity of the veteran community. If you can handle that you probably could enjoy the game but bringing in new friends is hell.			"

												First and foremost, if you are into the Japanese anime style mechs that have faces, lazer swords, and move around like the mutant offspring of a fighter jet and Jackie Chan (shame on you) you should bail right now. This is a tank warfare game where the tanks happen to have legs and are designed with an 80's retro vibe. For those of us that envision mechs as believable (abiet cheesy) machines of war, you've come to the right place. These things move with a sense of weight and momentum that simply isn't conveyed by other vehicular combat games. The torso section of the mech moves independently of the legs (think tank turret), and the arms can in many cases actuate indepently of the torso. All these factors require you to think about motion and positioning in a way most other first person games never touch on. This is also a fiercely team-oriented game, so all you lone wolves out there best stick with CoD. Pros:-giant robits!-Not pay-to-win-actively in developement with features added regularly-Completely unique even among other vehicular combat games-increadible mech customization options-good weapon variety-great sense of weight and impactCons:-really steep learning curve-game is more resource intensive than you might expect-LRMs (you will understand when you play)			"

												Definetly a money milker, but even with all its faults its still the best free game on steam. You do NOT need to pay to win in this game... but paying definetly saves time. I recommend this game to any and all interested people... just know that this dev is shady af and will most likely screw you over eventually one way or the other. I've only been playing a month now and they've already done it to me. I payed real money for a mech pack, and within a week they nerfed the stats of every single one of the mechs included in that mech pack. I'ts not a huge deal to me personally, but it was by all means a swift kick straight to the nuts. Stuff like that happens quite frequently in this game, so be weary.			"

 TLDR: Great game, try it, it is free (better to say ""free""). If you want play it seriously, you have to pay some real money. I am playing this game for years, since it started. I used to play it a lot, every day many hours, I am also Legendary Founder, and I've put to this game a lot of money - simply because I wanted, and I trusted that this game will be awesome.And it is. I love BattleTech (BT) universe, I love BT board game, I've played Mechwarrior PC games, red BT novels, I was immersed in reading BT manuals, readouts, and other BT related things.Gameplay of this game is great, and it is better and better over the time. They are adding more and more things, improving a lot of details, adding a lot of new mechs etc.And this game is free. Better to say ""free""...You can play it without paying any real money. You can buy a lot of Mechs for earned in-game money. You don't need color and decals to paint your mech, you don't need cocpit items. You don't need a lot of things in this game, but if you want play a lot, you want (and maybe need?) more mechs to be able to switch to another and play different game style etc. But mechbays - slots for mechs (1 mechbay = 1 mech) are obtainable only for MC, which you - guess what? Yes, which you can get only for real money. And this is from my point of view the biggest betrayal from developers.Also a lot of (better?) mechs are available only for MC.Developers often reveal new mechs, mech packs with a lot of variants for every mech, with a lot of benefits, etc. - sure for real money, and for a LOT of real money. Look, I am an adult, I have own home, work, I am paying bills, I don't have problem with money to be sure. But I always compare the value and usefulness when I am buying something. Paying tens of dollars for ONE MECH and a few other variants (this mean, you will have a few, for example 4 same chassis mechs (same type), with some differences) is not worth imo.So I can recommend this game, but I hate this style when game is ""free"", but developers are milking players for almost everything, in particular for key things such as mech-bays.I, as Legendary Founder and buyer many of these mech packs want some kind of respect and appreciation, not to be milked again and again for everything as other player who did not payed anything.By that I mean, that loyal fans (who paid (a lot of) money) should have some kind of discount reward system, or something like that.For my loyalty I got almost nothing, except some mechs (4?), some premium time (provides some exp. and money bonuses), and an cocpit item or something like that... that caused that I became tired of this system of milking and almost stopped playing this game.But as I told, even with this, I can recommend it, especially if you're a fan of BattleTech, MechWarrior, or just big fighting robots in simulator-like game :)			"

												I played this game from closed beta. Many fun times where had, it felt like a reasonably good battletech game, there was only a handfull of mechs, there was no Double heatsinks basically 3025 tech. When wanting to play a match it was easy to get a drop in, click launch and wham you were in and playing. If you wanted to play with friends you could group up and easily get into a match. There was repair and rearm mechanic which was a good way to govern people running munchkin builds.Over time numerous changes were made that made this game less and less fun, until finally I was forced to stop playing with the introduction of cockpit glass, since then I never went back.Now with the introduction of steam I thought I would be fair and have another crack at this game I used to like playing, however sadly it just does not have it. It is not what I would expect from a mechwarrior game, it is very shallow, limited repetive gameplay. The tier system is not a true ranking system and the only goal in the game is to pokemech so you can collect them all.The mech chassis are mostly just skins, and lack real variety or flavour, you have a few key loadouts replicated multiple times with just a different look. Since I last played it looks like they introduced the quirk system, this attempts to provide some unique flavour to mechs, but is more complicated then it needs to be and you need to play spreadsheetwarrior to be able to make sense of it. If mech customization was a bit more restricted I feel the balance would have been more natural then the artifiial quirk system that was introduced.Since the lack of repair and rearm munchkin builds became prolific, and continue to do so to this day, there is no consequence to running the most expensive kit in your assault mech. Every other F2p games introduce a repair mechanic and it works quite well as a natural balance mechanic, ala World of warships, World of tanks ,Warthunder and Armored Warfare and it manages to work quite well but PGI could not make it work.The graphics looked great back in Closed beta and were amazing, nowdays they are very hohum, the mech Models up to a certain point look pretty decent, but looking at some of the more recent releases, it looks like they are just calling it in doing the Bare minimum to pump out mech packs. The textures and effects are very dated looking now. Whether that is the age showing , or as Ihave heard they have dumbed the quality down because they couldn't make the game run optimally on higher settings I don't know.The community is polar opposites generally, you have black knights who hate the game with a passion, and the white knights who love the game like it was brought to us by the messiah. In my eyes both are wrong and the game is just meh.I may try a few more sync drops with friends that still club pugs over the next few days as that is the only way to get matches going quick enough, but taking the game as it stands today I find it a very shallow and meaningless game, unable to easily and quickly drop with friends for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles anymore. The beauty of it being F2P is you can try it out and make your own decision as to whether you want grind away or pay to skip.			"

												Many hours played 500+ prior to Steam. Long time fan of the MechWarrior games. MWO doesnt feel as ""mission based"" or customizable as previous single player campaigns of course. But for an online fast paced action packed Mech game... this is bad♥♥♥♥♥ Definetly worth playing. Click PLAY, give it a shot with your a free trial mech, grab the huge C-Bill increase for newbies (1st 25 matches) then buy whatever mech you want. It's well worth putting a little time into just to check it out.			"

												So... I don't like FPS games in general. Hey - come to think of it, I barely like any games.But, I like this one. I've played it for nearly two years, practically every day.Two reasons: 1) You are part of a team.Sometime your team is a blessing, sometime it's a curse. The game is unforgiving and does not keep tabs - make the wrong choice of 'mech or loadout, forget about where the team is and what they're doing, play in a match of random players doing all kinds of funny (bad) stuff - one misstake (yours or a team mate's) and you're out. Cry and moan every way you want about the outcome of the match or the performance of your team, but there's always something YOU could have done better  or better communicated with someone else about. Every now and again you have nothing to do with the outcome of a match - learn to live with it!2) It's Battletech(tm).Yes - It lacks some of the elements seen in previous titles in the franchise. It also is better than previous titles at other things. The last year, I've seen improvements in development I never would have thought possible when I started playing. There's also a lot of great improvements in the roadmaps, which I hope will adress many of the current shortcomings.I know many care about what have been and what will come. Me, I just play the hand I was dealt - Adopt, and have fun.			"

												Really enjoying this game.I'm finding it to be superior to other arcade games such as world of tanks or warthunder in quite a few areas. Namely the fact that you can never lose more money than you make im a battle, allowing players to play how they wish knowing they will progress positively after the match. Recieving 12 trial mechs is also nice.My only possible complaint is that the game can be grindy to make credits, unless you buy a good money making mech or have premium. That being said there is no rush to buy your own mech, it isn't pay to win in that sense since trial mechs can comfortably hold their own against normal mechs. hope this was useful to u scrubz			"

												Hello mechwarriors, and potential mechwarriors.I'am a long time player, original founder, and competitive team vet. I also played ALL the previous iterations of this franchise, going all the way back to the beginning. For what it's worth. I have played in well over 5000 drops, own 200+ mechs.On to the game itself.Oh I have spent money, but mostly, because I wanted to, I buy mech bays, and premium time mostly and up until recently every mech pack they sold. I took a small hiatus from purchasing packs until some game issues were resolved, I did not stop playing, not even a little, but I voted with my wallet for a while :).The game is fun, it's fast paced, and it requires you to think about what you are doing at all times, stop for a minute to look around, and you might be dead. There is a unique variance in how you play based on the type of mech you bring in the game, light, medium, heavy, assault. You can play the game as a solo participant or as a group participant, here is the divide, teamwork is OP, and always will be in a game that boasts a 12v12 atmosphere.Many people are reviewing this game, and many giove it negative reviews, mostly, because they are now, or at least were at some point, very passionate about this game, this is the common theme you will in reviews on steam for MWO, passion, it makes for a diverse and interesting commentary on how this game effects  the people who play it. Many people come and go, some say the ""best"" players have gone on to other games, tired of waiting for changes, and that may be true to an extent, though there are many current players that would argue the point :).Try the game, see for yourself, if you like shooters, this is the ultimate one, the diversity in how you kit out your mech is completely astounding, you have tons (literally) to play with, as I noted above I have 200+ mechs, and each one can have almost unlimited different configurations, just this alone is worth hours of ones time, mech lab is the game within the game, who can build the best robot? who is going to set the next ""meta"" ? no one knows for sure. There are so many resources and established units within the game, you won't be alone for long if you want to play with people, use HPGoutreach on reddit for many good guides, even though sometimes you need a salt filter in there, this is normal, and there are good people that simply will help you for nothing. If you want fierce competition and are willing to put in time, the competitive scene is pretty serious, you can get lost in tactics and builds and, well all the things.......one thing, always have fun when you play, try new things, run through the new tutorials, they are very good! play the trial mechs, they arent bad. You will start with others who have not played vis a vis the newish tier system implemented, you start at tier 5 and walk your way up to tier 1, tier 1 is pretty broad in scope, but be ready to play if you get there!!! some people do not miss, almost ever :) take your time in tier 5 and see what you like to do, shoot some stompy robots.If you see me in game, say Hi, my in game name is the same as here, and I will be happy to help however I can.come play my favorite game of all time, you might get hooked, you might hate it :) but it's free so why would you not try, I bet most will like it, who does not want to shoot giant stompy robots after all :)Never mind the occasional jerk in game, rats gonna rat, ask questions, have fun...

												An overall Average game with good customization (though Meta inhibited) let down by a lack of polish and progress.Bought into the founders pack years ago, buying Piranna's hype talk as if Microsoft didn't shove the game in their laps and force them to develope it.  Unfortunately there really hasn't been much improvement/optimization nor really any signs it's not a stagnated project that they keep around to farm money from the die-hard BattleTech fans who spew dosh to avoid the grind and coat their cockpits in swaggle.Maps -                  4/10Gamemodes -      6/10Server Health -    4/10Customization -   9/10 Communication - 5/10Graphics -             4/10F2p Grind -           5\10Maps:They're nice and open, but have dated textures even on the highest setting and they're poorly polished with the small selection getting extra boring extra quick-like.Oddly enough despite the 3+ years Piranna has had with the same maps the object collisions are still goofy. thin radio towers with mech wide invisible physical bodies or structures with giant gaps you try to shoot through/around only to be blocked while quite a few large rocks seems to have no collision presence.  You'll have to constantly struggle with your Mech catching on physical barriers that can't be seen and each slope is a gamble wether or not you can traverse it.Gamemodes:Standard f2p fare with your capture the flag and deathmatch that's about it, unless you do clan wars which is just the same.  Platooning is a nightmare, pairing up with only 1-2 peeps and you'll be facing whole teams of the same clan sync dropping to farm pubs. or come hauling a teams worth of pals and you'll still only go against clans.The pubcrawl is awful, there's a small player base which if you ignore the oceanic server for ping reasons gets even smaller, so you'll be in queue alot.Server Health:There's a worringly thinning player base, and everyone pinned their hopes on it spiking after the game was added to steam, but http://steamcharts.com/app/342200 .Customization:You can make a large variety of custom builds, but all mechs look the same unless you put actual money into it, which is fine.  The main stinker is the awkward balancing that creates a standard that everyone uses to stay competitive.  Worst thing is ballistics never seem to get a spotlight.Graphics:Dated and poorly optimized.Grind:I would compare it to WoT, you grind to get your mech, then you grind to make it useful.  You'll buy your mech, let's say a medium for 5mil, then you'll need to grind another 1.5mil for Dheatsinks, then another 1.9mil for a practical engine (hopefully your build doesn't need a 4mil XL engine), then another 500k for a lighter frame, then 1.6mil for weapons.  You'll need to do that 3 times so you can have enough of the same chassis to unlock useful perks for it.  Painful even with premium.			"

												As a three year vet, I love this game.  There are too many reviews to wade through for me to egotistically believe that a long meandering review will cut through the rest.  So I'll keep this short and sweet.It's a free to play FPS game where giant stompy robots shoot each other in 12 v 12 matches.  To the new Steam players that are joining us: this is not a simple game.  Your twitch skills from other shooters will definitely help you, and may even give you an edge over the old timers eventually.  But prepare for a steep learning curve.  There is SO MUCH nuance to understanding this game, let alone succeed at it, that no one will be an elite pilot without some serious time logged.  But, if you want a challenge, this game is it.My advice to you, the new player, is this.Join the game.  Jump into the tutorial system and get the hang of the basics of movement and shooting.  Play 10 matches or so in quickplay to get a taste of combat.  Save up that starting cash and play trial mechs at first.THEN: Ask in team chat or General chat if there are any vets that would be willing to help answer your questions and show you around.  You can lone wolf all you want in this game, but there is simply too much to understand if you don't ask questions.  Established units all have teamspeak servers and would love to help you learn the game.  Please take advantage of the existing community.  Most of us are drinking beers, having fun and are ready and willing to share both with anyone that wants to learn.  You don't need to make any commitment to joining units.  The community of vets truly want the game to succeed and grow, and we know that the best way to do that is to tutor new players.  When you know what you're doing, you've built a stable of mechs that fit your playstyle and you drop with a group of pilots that you have grown comfortable with, there is simply no better gaming experience to be had anywhere.  Crack a beer and look me up on the Steiner Teamspeak hub.  ts1.housesteiner.com  No Password.  My Callsign is Veritae and I'm the XO of Team Cortez Merc Corps (TCMC).  I'll vouch for any unit on the hub.  Peiper and the Devil Dogs are a great group of guys that switch between Wolf and Steiner and enjoy roleplaying.  FFI is a growing and emerging comp merc unit that switches between Clan and Inner Sphere and are a blast to hang out with.   6RCT, 5RCT, OCP, LoP and on and on and on all have vets that play every day and would love to help you out.  Play the game.  Join the community.  Welcome to Mechwarrior: Online.			"

												A very 'thinky' shooter. You'll spend just as long tinkering with your mechs as you will using said mechs to facesmash people. Few games have the amount of satisfaction this game does when you make a good mech or when you do a good shot and cripple another player.Insanely moreish, not too grindy and definitely worth playing!

												My review of MechWarrior Online:  Jan 15 2016Mechwarrior was one of those games I grew up on when I was younger.  The player pilots an armored mech and does battle with eleven other players on a variety maps.  Graphics:  I have nothing much to compare this against except maybe Hawken and Titanfall and it can match some of their look.  Maps are generally good looking ranging from desert wastelands to artic towns.  Weapons like lasers glow, leaving heat marks. and missles/rockets general smoke trails.  You can tell the damage of mechs by how much smoke they can sometimes generate from the damage they have taken.  Cockpits are fully detailed, though you can't push the buttons, and are unique for each kind of Mech.  Sound:  There is not much to say about the sound as much of it is muffled.  You get verbal warnings and indicators for what is happening on the map or happening to you.  What I mean for muffled sound is;  you are hearing what you would hear inside your mech.  The thumps of your feet stomping around and bumping into terrain. The hiss of your heat sinks trying to cool you down.  The bang of ballistic weapons being fired and the cycling of energy weapons as they discharge.Gameplay:  In the main menu players can select which Mech they want to pilot.  Once you pick a chassis (general shape and character of the mech) you pick a varient (loadout options)  and you are ready to go.  The roles are broken up into weight classes.  Light mechs are your small light weight fast movers.  Mediums mechs and Heavy mechs seem to be your general all round mechs and Assault mechs are the heavy hitters.  While fighting players have to manage their Mech's heat and torso while they manuever around in battle shooting enemies.   After each battle awards players with xp for their chosen Mech and credits that they can spend on getting new mechs or customizing the ones they currently own.  You spend your XP on skill boosts that affect the performance of your Mech.New player experience?:  After installing and signing in, players complete a tutorial to learn how to effectively pilot mechs.  Though many of the more advanced systems are not discussed or gone over in the tutorial, players can complete challenges to see said systems.  They recieve a stack of credits where they can save up to buy their first mech.  Trial Mechs are freely given and rotate regularly to allow players to try out different styles.  Overall:  It is a fun game,  you could lose many hours of sleep into it.  The community seems fairly friendly as the game does have built in voice chat.  Games tend to be more group friendly as you get awards for fighting together.  It does have a bit of a learning curve but what game doesn't.  Just remember to not go alone,  lone mechs are tasty. "

												Back a couple of years ago the grind was real and the choices of mechs was little. The game looked to be in a dark place. I came back this year and was plesently suprised. Heaps of content added, things seemed pretty balanced and the grind has been massively reduced, especially for new players.Definitely recommened.			"

												I love this game and it really is free to play. They have rotating trial mechs in all weight classes so you can take anything for a test drive and figure out what fits your play style best. Purchasing mechs can be done by using in-game money given after each match or by purchasing currency with real money. Purchasing mechs lets you be able to customize them and save load-outs but is something anyone can grind away enough to buy for free. There are premium mech designs that are real cash only when they first become available but these are mostly pretty eye candy and become available to be purchased with free in-game money after awhile I've heard. This may sound like a P2W aspect but it's really not. The pilot is more important than the mech. You can spend as much money as you want and still get your a$$ handed to you by a grade school kid who knows how to pilot his freebie mech.  It mostly comes down to this: If you want the newest thing right now today you can buy it, but you're willing to grind away you can get it for free down the road. If you're like me you'll try it for free and then want to make some purchases to get some neat stuff and support an awesome game at the same time.			"

												I started with MWO back when it was in closed beta and loved it. I took a break for a while after ECM was first implemented because it seemed to force everyone into running ECM/Brawing builds. I pikced the game up agian when I saw the steam launch and its been great. The build diversity is back! Community Warfare is live and still needs some work but the changes coming down the pipe look very promising. As it is, the game is a fantastic tactical team oriented shooter. The customizaton is nearly limitless and I swear I spend almost as much time in the mech lab as I do in matches. Its a fantastic F2P sim/shooter. A must for Battletech fans and most other folks should probably try it out too.			"

												As a long time player and as much as it hurts to say I just can't recommend this game. It really is a hollow game with little in the way of depth. At its base the game play isn't bad, but that is about all that it has going for it. Lack of real content wouldn't be a problem exactly if this was a brand new game, but this isn't a new game and has been in development for a long time. The devs just can't seem to do it. Between absurd decisions and poor communication there is little reason to trust things will ever actually get better.			"

Despite some issues the balance is largely there and the grind compares favourably to similar games (e.g. World of Tanks) - which is just as well as there is some severe price gouging going on for mechs if you go down the premium route.Strong roster of mechs and a decent mechlab keeps things fresh.

												If you are looking for a team based, tactical, first person shooter with big stompy robots this is a great game to pick up. Quickplay will get you matches fast but the best part is finding people to play with regularly in Faction Warfare. It is the most cordial PvP game I have ever played. Trolls are pretty rare, whiners are rare, and you enemy often will salute before a match. Teamspeak is a must if you want to coordinate with other players. Find the house TS you like and blow up other big stompy robots.			"

												Grew up with BattleTech and the MechWarrior series, so my opinion might be a little biased, but I love this game. F2P isn't the easiest thing to balance apparently, but I think they did a good job here.There will be grinding if you want diversity and mastered mechs (you need to obtain 3 of a chassis and grab tons of XP to get this) - not to mention the pilot skills which require an XP hit to unlock AND a C-Bill hit to purchase.New mechs are coming out all the time and the devs are pretty good about releasing new maps and/or upgrading the older ones. You've gotta pay to get into the new mechs when they're released, but eventually they become available for either MC (premium currency) or C-Bills (grind money).It's free, so you should try it out. Read up on some lore, too - BattleTech's is pretty awesome. :] And if you do end up playing, don't feel bad when you inevitably spend the $20 to get some new mechs + early adopter rewards. The devs gotta eat! "

												Ive been playing MWO for a few months now.I do like this game a fair bit, and find it fun to play however there are some problems Im sure EVERYONE would like to see fixed or changed at very least.First and foremost is COST, buying mechs, MC, and ""decals"" such as paint colours and cockpit items is FAR TOO EXPENSIVE. Yes the vast majority of mechs are purchasable with some grinding, and there is a huge in-game-currency bonus for shiny new players; however many mechs one may want cost cold hard cash and are TOO EXPENSIVE.Experienced players have a huge advantage as there IS a learning curve, and on top of that the bonuses for ""working in"" mechs and buying ""modules"", which is really cool and gives motivation for grinding. Some new players may feel intimidated.PLEASE PLAY THE TUTORIAL. PRESS ""R"" to target (to share targeting data and help with teamplay).A Great game, please give it a chance.			"

I have been playing Mechwarrior Franchise since Mechwarrior 2, also playing the Battletech CCG.  Love it all, always have.  This game is a great change of pace from any other FPS on the market.  Different guns, different armor, different speeds and different mechs.  It is sweet.  Will continue to support the game.For a starter or newbie this make take awhile to get into, the game is definitely a grinding game, or if your wallet is deep enough.  I don't have an issue with the pay vs grinding.The Pilot Tier system is a little odd just because it takes forever to rank up, but that is expected.To anyone new I highly recommend Clan mechs over Inner Sphere, at one point I had a full IS mechlab and now stricly Clan mechs only.  players choice but Clan is awesome.

												The good:>Lots of customization of mechs AFTER you buy one (there are lots of guides available on which mechs to buy for what playstyle once you've familiarized yourself with the game.) Want bigass cannons? Go for it. Like EZ aim mode lasers? Pew pew.>Graphical update in March made this game look amazing. Every mech has 2k textures and the game set to ultra high looks awesome on systems that can run it.>BIG MECH. Knock over ALL OF THE TREES. RaaaaAAAAAAA.>Smart play and tactics get rewarded. Idiots that rush in alone die, even if they bought a ""pay to win"" mech.>There is no pay2win model here. Most purchases are cosmetic; extra mech bays can be earned thorugh faction warfare (please save this for when you've played lots) and most mechs you see only for sale for real money are later available for in-game currency.>Your first 25 matches have a HUGE bonus to in game currency earnings. Save it for when you're ready to buy; the 17 million total plus whatever you earn playing will be enough to buy an assault mech.>Hot damn, the animations are great.>PGI is somewhat connected to their playerbase and actively tries to improve their game.>Free to play; if you don't enjoy it, all it costs is time. If you love it and never spend a cent, WOO. Free game!>Active and helpful community. If you have questions, there's always someone or somewhere you can go to get them answered.>Supprt is generally helpful and almost always polite yet concise. Even though they have a small team, they are a damn good team at that.>It FEELS like you're driving a 20 to 100 ton machine of doom. Even the smallet of these things dwarf some of the buildings in this game. The scale is AWESOME.>Every cockpit of every mech is different. It's awesome.The bad:>Limited maps in both quick play and faction warfare. You will learn them all fairly quickly.>If you want to own ALL of the mechs, you will have to pay for them in the long run. For some people, that's fine. Just be aware of what you're buying first. Do research on mechs before you buy. DO RESEARCH. You will hate yourself if you get something you do not enjoy playing.>Despite the few years this game has been out, not a lot has come out aside from a couple maps here, a UI update there. PGI has a small team; expect the game to evolve somewhat slowly.>Not every mech is a good one. There are balance issues like in any other online game with player versus player, but it sucks to buy a crap mech. But yes, research. You can avoid this with KNOWLEDGE.>No single player mode. There is work being done for a PvE campaign, but I don't expect it to be done any time soon.>Meta play gets to be a bit.. well.. obvious. Just be ready for the occasional tryhard with a 100% optimal build that can three shot you with alpha strikes. Of course, you can always shoot them back.>In game currency earnings gets really slow after those first 25 matches. Sorry. It'll be grindy to get that second or third mech you want.>Premium time in-game is used even if you are not actively playing. If you have 3 days of premium, it will be gone in 3 days. Regardless of if you play or not.>Faction play needs work. I'll not say more. It's fun and all, but it needs work.>Third person mode sucks. If you despise first person, well.. good luck?(who hates first person though lol psh)>NOT GAMEOAD/JOYSTICK FRIENDLY OMG Even with custom inputs it blows. You're stuck with KB&M.Overall: 9/10 game, would recommend			"

												I've been playing this game since beta.At first, I was somewhat hesitant about MWO. You see, I’m not all that into PvP games. And, when I learned that MWO was all PvP, I really wasn’t interested at first. But, the lure of Big Stompy Robots eventually dragged me into trying it.So, there I was grinding out my twenty five cadet bonus matches in a Trial JM-6 Jagermech. My first mech purchase was a Blackjack as they were first released. I realized that this was a different kind of PvP game- it was slower, the concept of walking tanks did a good job of mitigating the twitch play that I didn’t like. Sure there was still twitch play with light mechs, but it was still a little slower and methodical that other FPS games I played.Now, a few years (and a bunch of mech packs) later, I find I truly do love this game.What I like most about this game, compared to other tank games, is the method in which you get your vehicles. See, in other tank games, you have to contend with tech/progression trees- forcing you to drive or fly equipment you don’t like in order to work your way into gear that you do.Not so with this game. If I want to drive a Timberwolf, I can either grind the CBills to get them, buy the MC to get it or buy it straight away from the gift store. Can’t do that with an M1 Abrams, German Tiger or P-51.I love how customizable the game is. Much of the fun of the game is spending time in the mechlab finding that perfect build that synergizes my playstyle with the mechs quirks and hardpoint arrangement. See not all build fit all, some build that work great for one guy may not work so well for other. But, finding that great build that works for you is truly satisfying.Another thing I love about this game is the regular events that PGI holds. Grab bag events, Leaderboard events, Faction play events and Cumulative stretch goal events, there’s always something going on.There’s a lot of good stuff on the horizon for this game-The fabled Unseens are being released on a monthly basis as we speak.  If you’re a Battletech aficionado, you can truly appreciate the return of these classics.PvE is coming; we already see glimpses of PvE in the Mechwarrior Academy.A large update is coming to Faction Warfare that will appeal to small groups (4v4) as well as large.If you’re new to the game, do check out the Spike Brave tutorials on youtube. Also, play the Mechwarrior Academy, play it a lot, play it some more. The Mechwarrior Acandemy is a great resource.Give the game its fair shake, just like I did, and I think you will be impressed with it, just like I am.			"

												Ignore the salt and try for yourself.  I've been playing since open beta and have had, and am having, a blast.  A lot of great people on here who are willing to help out new players.  Fairly large learning curve, as far as shooters go, but stick with and things will click into place.  Go to twitch to find live streaming or on youtube for tons of tutorials and matches.  Watch some comp matches to see how it's really played.... but please, form your own decision from your own experience, don't listen to the salt pushers....			"

												I have been playing this game since late 2012, and it's amazing how much this game has changed since then.UI, graphics, FPS optimisation, mechs(I remember when there was only like 6...), change from 8v8 to 12v12, the beginning of clan invasion, OP srms, no overheat damage, and of course what is most obvious to a lot of you, the Steam migration.The community for this game has never dissapointed me, and the frequent addition of mechs to the game added new reasons for me to continue playing. If you have not tried this game out, I highly recommend doing so!Loved it in 2012, love it in 2016...			"

												Very fun game overall.May not be the best combat experience for those who like quick kills, but it is interesting with all the variety of Mechs that you can play as. Has a wide variety of mechs that suit each persons needs, whether that be fast movement and scouting, support spotting, high damaged support, tank damage or tank damage and high damage output.The immersion that I get from playing this game is not like any other game that I have played before, it grips me into the experience and makes me believe I am inside one of these mechs.There are no abusive text chats that I have seen so far in the total 2.3 hours I have played this game, only supportive unlucky man or nice shooting.I may not be the most experienced player but I highly recommend this game to anyone who maybe having thoughts of whether to play it or not. It is free so why not just try it? You may like the a lot.			"

												The learning curve is very high, it is a game heavily based on skill (and skills that are very specific to this game due to the unique mechanics) and your performance in the game is very dependant on the other 11 players on your team.However, it offers some unique experiences unlike anything else on the market. And the best part is that none of the mechs are ""upgrades"" of others, each chassis has it's role, play style and flavor and you have access to most of the mechs right off the bat, without having to do anything apart from creating an account *.Best idea is to find an in-game unit to join soon after starting the game and getting your bearings, because playing in an organized team is miles ahead of playing with 11 random people.* when introducing a new chassis, they are usually only purchaseable with real money, for the first couple of months.

												As a long time HAWKEN fan, I avoided this game as I constantly heard pay to win and outlandish mech pricing claims.Having just started playing, one thing I can say is this is no Hawken and I was wrong to draw comparisons. This is much more of a simulation experience and not a FPS - in the style of something like Elite: Dangerous or World of Tanks. It has a slow, deliberate pace focusing on the strength of the unit and not the individual.It's deep and complex but once you buy and outfit your first mech (which can be done straight away) you absolutely can compete with those who have been playing since the beta. A few novice light mechs can take down or disable any Behemoth, if they work together and target the right areas.If you're a big badass robot fan like me who was really skeptical about about Mechwarrior Online, now's the time to give it a try. It's not perfect and the interface is pretty clunky but on the battlefield, where it counts, Mechwarrior Online is the game we all remember.			"

												Don't worry about the negative reviews, it's just salty long time players who are struggling.The game has a good hard learning curve, you'll need patience to gather a foundation of suitable META mechs to play with and compete well. Look up meta builds and good mechs, join a unit to play with and learn. Playing with people is better than playing alone.Buy mech packages once you know if you want to play Innersphere or Clans.You will get stomped in pub matches and community warfare often, learn to move around and not sit still !GL HF !

												Its a really fun game, but the dev's are awful and make the grind even worse than it should be. Under the current dev plans, you have to pay an exhorbitant amount of money to respec your mech which is half the fun of the game changing it up and experimenting with different builds(Imagine lol with dedicated runes per champion and having to delete the runes and buy new ones any time you wanted to try a new build). But they are punishing you for it. The devs are out of touch and I cant recommend this to anyone thinking about playing when they are ruining one of the best parts of the game...			"

												HELLO THERE EVERYBODY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'll keep this simple. This game does take time to learn. You will feel like your being stepped on sometimes. But it's worth it. As a vet player from the original closed beta days, I can tell you that it HAS gotten better. The UI has improved a lot. Matchmaking is WAY better than before. Community Warfare still needs work. The map and mode selecting I don't like that much, but that's just me. :)  Some very classic BattleTech mechs are coming and some are already here. There are many vet players like myself, who are willing to help new players enjoy the game we enjoy. Take your time and learn how to play. Don't rush it. Have a question? Just ask us, and we will help you. Yeah this isn't much of a review. But it's a fun game. GO DOWNLOAD IT ANY START KILLING GIANT ROBOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

CW was promising but as fallen flat on its face with pugs being stomped on by teams/clans, plus there is no real feel of doing anything as your playing the same maps on the same planets all the time.

												MWO is, and probably always will be, something of a work in progress. It has it's faults, but can be an amazing game as well.Pros:- BattleMech customization: They have struck a fairly good balance between the standard tabletop construction rules and a hardpoint system to prevent rediculous boating and encourage customization. You CAN make pretty much an kind of variant you want, even if it's not always smart (See the Cons)- Variable gameplay: You can make your play as involved (or not) as you want. Quickplay gives you the ability to jump right into a match, which lasts for a maximum of 15 minutes. More depth can be had in Faction Play (also known as Community Warfare), where group play is strongly encouraged and players fight across various planets in the Inner Sphere. Keep in mind, this mode is scheduled for significant changes in the next few months (CW: Phase 3)- Community: This can be a negative in any game, but MWO at least has the redeeming feature of a strong population of mature gamers and Battletech veterans to balance out the annoying trolls. You can find groups to match what you're looking for.- Visuals: It's made by a small dev studio, and some of the graphics can show it at times, but they are rescued by an indredibly talented art department. Mech models in particular are almost universally superbly done.- It's an F2P that is most assuredly NOT Pay2Win. Real life purchases are for cosmetics and boosters, as well as early access to newly released Mechs. It may take a month or two, but any mech that is initially released for $$$ will always subsequently be released for in-game currencyThe Cons:- Time-sink: Yes, it's a time sink. The grind can be pretty severe at times, as in-game earnings can take quite a while, especially if you are playing as a solo player.- Release Schedule for mechs: This can be a matter of perspective. While the game is not pay2win, there is a tendency for new mechs to be initially relased (during the real life $$$ period)  with ""op"" characteristics. Sometimes it's oddly coded hit-boxes, sometimes it's poorly thought out design quirks that give an advantage. The design is then fixed/nerfed just as or shortly before the design becomes available for in-game currency. Taken individually, any of them appear to just be mistakes by the devs, but it is slightly suspicious that the pattern has repeated itself so many times.- The ""pro"" or ""comp"" community: MWO has a small but dedicated group of competetive players. They play in the Faction play, and third-party tournaments. While there are plenty of good people who participate, the overall comp scene can be quite abrasive, and it's members pompous and annoying. It likely stems from being the top dog in a very small community, like being boastful of being elected Class President of your home-school class of 1 person. If you've ever known that team in an adult rec league that take things too far, as if they're pros or something, that's exactly what this is. Most enjoy showing how ""leet"" they are by clubbing seals over and over. It's possible that revisions to CW and the influx of new blood from Steam will help, but that remains to be seen.- Teamwork is required, but rarely to be found: Teamwork is huge, people playing as a team have a huge advantage. The game has built-in chat and VoiP, but they are usually just used to troll/abuse. Especially on the weekends, there is an influx of low-skill players who simply do not work with their team at all, and this can be frustrating as it can virtually guarantee losses if you get stuck with that team.- The ""meta"": While you can theoretically build any type of mechs you want, certain weapons/combos/variants are just plain better and stronger. If you want to have any success at the higher skill levels, you have to use the meta.			"

												I'm not sure if I can fully recommend this game especially newer players from steam. veteren players will constantly verbally assault newer players because of their lack of skill which also brings up the fact that they need a playlist for newer players to get adjusted. Before there was no tutorial good enough to prepare you for the brutal multiplayer where veterans would slaughter new players often turning them away from the game. They have a new tutorial which teacher you mmuch needed info but still not enough to just thrust you into hell. I had played this game before it came to steam and decided to bring along a friend and teach him how to play but he quickly stopped playing after three matches of toxic players calling him trash and to uninstall the game even with warning to these players that he was newer and its to be expected especially with the games terrible tutorial at the time. The gameplay is solid and exciting for sure. If you have assistance breaking the learning curve and have friends that you can communicate with you will have a much better experience like most games.One final complaint is the horrid grind to ""master"" specific mechs and the game often puts you in uncomfortable positions grinding out currency to pay for varients of the mech you want.I would recommend this game but its to steep of a curve for new players mixed with the toxicity of the veteran community. If you can handle that you probably could enjoy the game but bringing in new friends is hell.			"

												This game is like mustard: -There are people who hate it while others who love it. It all depends on what you personally enjoy.- It takes a while to get used to so dont get discouraged if it leaves a bad taste after a while for it does get better with  repetition and experience. (steep learning curve)Pros:- It's free so you wont lose anything if you give it a try.- No pay to win through added steroids and costly rare seeds.- Many and continued improvements throughout the years- Enjoyable and clean game play- Plays best when accompanied by other helpful entities (TEAMWORK and friends)- Many play styles to choose from like up close and personal or support (I like my mustard off to the side)- Occasional free items through eating contests- Many varieties to choose from (mech variants)- Friendly community of enthusiastsCons:- Lack of teamwork will make the game sour and spoil the experiance - Stains carpet- Pay for branding (colors/camo/aesthetics)- Some minor ingredient imbalances but nothing really worth throwing it out over- Learning what play style you enjoy EARLY in game given limited starting resources can be frustratingFinal thoughts: I dont really see this game as much of a grinding type game due to the enjoyment i get out of it. Given that, either you will enjoy it or you wont. I find this game relaxing and fun to play, plus it's free which is just an added bonus and gives ME an incentive to help the developers through in game purchases such as camo, colors, warhorns or to obtain mechs sooner. Not like other twitch FPS but requires thought and stradegy given lots of different variables.There is a lot to learn so do the tutorial and look up mechspecs to help you out and then fine tweak it to your play style.  I sucked at this game at first but at least give 10hrs(?) of play time to develop an understanding of game play mechanisms and tactics before leaving the community which may be hard to ask for someone to do.

Has a wide variety of mechs that suit each persons needs, whether that be fast movement and scouting, support spotting, high damaged support, tank damage or tank damage and high damage output.The immersion that I get from playing this game is not like any other game that I have played before, it grips me into the experience and makes me believe I am inside one of these mechs.There are no abusive text chats that I have seen so far in the total 2.3 hours I have played this game, only supportive unlucky man or nice shooting.I may not be the most experienced player but I highly recommend this game to anyone who maybe having thoughts of whether to play it or not. It is free so why not just try it? You may like the a lot.			"

												The learning curve is very high, it is a game heavily based on skill (and skills that are very specific to this game due to the unique mechanics) and your performance in the game is very dependant on the other 11 players on your team.However, it offers some unique experiences unlike anything else on the market. And the best part is that none of the mechs are ""upgrades"" of others, each chassis has it's role, play style and flavor and you have access to most of the mechs right off the bat, without having to do anything apart from creating an account *.Best idea is to find an in-game unit to join soon after starting the game and getting your bearings, because playing in an organized team is miles ahead of playing with 11 random people.* when introducing a new chassis, they are usually only purchaseable with real money, for the first couple of months.

												Don't worry about the negative reviews, it's just salty long time players who are struggling.The game has a good hard learning curve, you'll need patience to gather a foundation of suitable META mechs to play with and compete well. Look up meta builds and good mechs, join a unit to play with and learn. Playing with people is better than playing alone.Buy mech packages once you know if you want to play Innersphere or Clans.You will get stomped in pub matches and community warfare often, learn to move around and not sit still !GL HF !

												Been playing this constantly from Closed Beta and still loving it after 3 years. Developers of this game are true fans of the Battletech and work on this game with passion, for what they did with with their limitations is just amazing. They make and give us as munch as their resources allow it. Yes, game is not perfect, but man it's good! :)My favorite MMO for over 3 years and I'm proud to support it.If you like complex and deep in all good of this meaning FPS MMO, then MechwarriorOnline is at leat worth a try.P.S. On my expirience this is the least grindy MMO I ever played.			"

												Its a really fun game, but the dev's are awful and make the grind even worse than it should be. Under the current dev plans, you have to pay an exhorbitant amount of money to respec your mech which is half the fun of the game changing it up and experimenting with different builds(Imagine lol with dedicated runes per champion and having to delete the runes and buy new ones any time you wanted to try a new build). But they are punishing you for it. The devs are out of touch and I cant recommend this to anyone thinking about playing when they are ruining one of the best parts of the game...			"

												Awesome Fun Game. Can be Overwhelming at first, and the tutorial doesnt do much to teach you about things like ammo conservation or heat issues but does inform you of the basics. Stick it out until you can customize your first mech to create a monster mech you can work with. Building them to make them better is half the fun.			"

												Mechwarrior has been a fantastic series of games, but in the past, the multiplayer options never even began to capture the feel of the old pen and paper.  It was always a race to the top.  Run the biggest mech or die!MWO has fixed that.  This is a tactics game.  This is a game where how you play your role is REWARDING.  This is a game where two large teams enter, but every player counts.And this game rewards you for finding your favorite balance of speed, armor, firepower, and battle field enduance (heat and quantity of ammo).This is a game about trading blows, taking risks, and defining the envelope.And the best thing about this game, is it truly is free to play.  The light mechs are cheap, but POWERFUL in skilled hands.  The medium mechs are affordable and are the standard battlefield units.  The expensive assault, though expansive, may have a role to play, and are worth every penny, but they do NOT own the battlefield.And every patch rewards people who play their role more and more.I am a freelance mercenary.  I am not a part of a unit, I do not use team speak, I am a pug player, and I still thrive in Community Warefare.I cannot say how amazing this game is.  It is amazing, it has been amazing, and every month, more and more value is added to the game.DOWNLOAD IT!!!! You cannot lose if you get it for free, so what are you wating for?!			"

												To truly enjoy MWO:1) Get a microphone2) Get used to team work3) Remember that FF is on and to not overheat because you will damage yourself and you will kill yourself.-Short Review: It's a good game that is very addictive, very fun and very team oriented. If you're a lone-wolf type prepare to be disappointed because this game isn't for you.  MWO uses a number of effects that you rarely see in FPS shooters and requires more thought to kill one mech than I have ever seen in any game before.Things that I liked about the game:+ HEAT: Mechs don't just fire lazers endlessly, you have a certain amount of HEAT before you pass the thresh-hold and just shut down. This makes firing something as unlimited as lazers tricky. HEAT is effective by the ambient temperature as well as other enviornmental quirks. What I liked about HEAT is that it balances the fire-power within mechs. +A lot of variants: MWO has tons of variants and classes of mechs to choose from. Don't like being a big clunky and slow target? Pick a light class mech. Don't like using only lazers? Well there's different variants for different chasis. Because the variants are so easy to get and the upgrades for them are cheap this makes experimenting with the bots less costly and more fun. +FACTIONS: This conquer and defend style of factions kept me in a very happy mood. Loads of banners to cast your loyalty to and loads of perks and rewards for siding with those factions. FACTION PLAY is the big leagues for MWO. With thousands of planets and maps to explore you will be occupied with more than just the DM style of quickplay. Not only does FACTION demand a sense of loyalty but a sense of tactical approach I have never seen in an FPS. You will find that players are actively trying to call out and use plans to thwart their enemy combatants. From defending a planet you own to attacking another to increase your factions control of the galaxy this is something that I really enjoyed!-What I didn't like: -Mech Bays: Mech bays limit the amount of mechs that you can buy and add to your MECHLAB. This doesn't seem like much of a big deal but the SKILLS for certain variants of mechs require you to buy and maximum level 3 variants. You only get 4 empty mech bays at the start and you can only aquire more by either paying real money or by earning them through faction promotions. This makes it difficult to get EXPERT into mechs and limits your choice of weight class if you're interested in experting in a certain chasis.----That's all I feel about MWO. The content is grand and the players are fun. "

I plan on buying more mech bays and actually planting my wallet into this game, it should cost money to play. The gameplay is brilliant. The graphics are good. The engine is great. The proggression, mechs and upgrade system is the better than any other game (Even world of tanks) The only downside is that someone might disconnects from your team and you loose!

												MW3 nastalgia.Play a Cata A1 Missile boat. Ran out of ammo. proceeded to run around and distract/tank shots while team mates around me dropped the Mechs. after getting them down to a single light, i took an opportunity and pinned the silly little chicken while my team pounded him with a hail of fire. Funny Business aside, this is at first glance a battle arena ""shooter"". However, you have to think with this one. if you're not a MW fan then you may fumble with the controls initially but just think that its a tank. the Tutorial is quick but you learn the basics. This is definitely a good one to play, especially Fans of the universe. The major Drawback in my opinion, is the lack of Modes and maps. it has somewhere between 5-8 maps but only 3 modes, Assault, Conquest, and Skirmish. There could be a bigger selection of Game modes and a few more maps and this would be a lot better. Hawken, another F2P Mecha shooter, has several modes and a hanful of maps. the mode selection is what caught me on that game. If a lower budget Mech shooter like Hawken can have multiple modes why doesn't MWO have more? In conclusion, I think this is a great Mech Shooter. its not the simple shooter mechanics, it stays true to the MechWarrior playstyle. the MW3 Nastalgia hit my in the gut hard. The game suffers from the lack of Modes, a few more would really benefit this game.			"

The gameplay is amazing and for a competitive game the community is surprisingly helpful and non-toxic. The game is very heavy on teamwork, which is refreshing in this world of games where you just go around and do your own thing. You'll find your teammates to be usually helpful and there's a built-in voice chat system when in a match so you're able to communicate more easily with your team. I would definitely recommend this game, especially to anyone who loves games with giant robots, as MechWarrior is THE best mech game title ever.			"

												After taking the Mechwarrior Franchise, making unfulfillable promises, and shoveling out constant microtransaction laden content, its no wonder that MWO has hurt fans of the franchise.  Grinding for mechs takes forever, and once you fill the very limited number of mech bays on your account, youre left with either not growing your hangar or shelling out money for the opportunity to grind even more and purchase other mechs.  While occassionally fun, PGI has massively mishandled the game and lost out on an opportunity to make something special.  Long time fans will enjoy the gameplay, but find the grind tedious and unrewarding without spending money.			"

												I like taking a giant death robot out and stomping other giant death robots into the ground.That being said, this is one of the most balanced free games I've played, you don't gain a significant advantage by putting real money into the game, keeps it fun for poor folks like myself.  If you're looking for a shooter, this probably won't fit your fancy.  It's slow going with a steep learning curve, and you don't rack up kills with any speed. Far more rewarding in my opinion to play with a group, but I played solo for a long while before teaming up in game, and it wasn't a terrible experience.If you're looking for something that is going to give you tons of customization, and make you think tactically, this game is solid.

												SOOOOOOO, i have spent a happy amount of time playing this game and my conclusion is, it's reallly fun. However it's not the kind of game that's intuitive. Sure you'll eventually figure stuff out but in process you'll probs waste a good ammount of ingame currency like i did. So watch/ read some guides on what some mech builds look like as well as look at some stratagies for keeping yourself alive. I recomend watching some videos by SideStrafe. He's a pretty savy Mech warrior and you could learn a few things from him. Here is a link to his ""begginers guid to customization"" vid:

			Having trouble customizing your first few mechs in MechWarrior Online? Then this guide is for you! I cover the basics as well as the thought process that goes into outfitting a chassis that suits...		

 Does this sound like a hassle? Perhaps a little, but the game really shines in its long term attractivness. The combat is more strategic and slower than other shooters (that being said, you will probs find youself in some really fast paced situations pretty often, especially if you are a light mech), there is a TON of stuff to unlock so you'll be kept busy, and you can get pretty occupied with customizing your mechs as well. Also, don't permanently sign your allegience to a faction till you farmed them all for some free mechbays. After that, THEN choose the faction you like. I hope the review was helpfull m8s.			"

NEVER seen this in real life ever and i work as an it seller and we do PC service allso so its quite anoying!!!I have Intel Ci7-4790K 16gigs ASUS GTX970 4GB. No other game is doing this to me :/ if anybody knows how to repair this, let me know!If the game runs ok for you its a charm !!!One of the best online games ever!Cons: except my problem... its the mechlab that was a lot better few months before.. where i could see what weapon where fits right on the mech. (mechs was like allways shown not only coolored boxes like now.			"

												I've been a fan of the BattleTech Universe for over 20 years.  I've played many iterations and versions of the games.  I've decided that this is probably the best BattleTech based game I've played in a long time.This game is a Free-to-Play game, with in-game purchases available.  However, it's perfectly playable without spending anything.  It puts you in the cockpit of a giant robot weighing anywhere from 20 to 100 tons.  The game does take a little bit to get used to and the initial learning curve can be steep.  I found I had to reprogram the default keys to match my play style better.  Once I did that, I found myself doing much better.  There is a plethora of guides and tutorials available as well as a large number of communities.  Give it a chance.  If you're into this genre, you won't be disappointed.  It's like World of Tanks, but with BattleMechs.			"

												If you have played the other 4 mech warriors then you are most likely going to enjoy this one, the mech customization is a little different but the basic system is still in place. there are heaps of mechs for each of the two sides, and each mech can be modified however you want, making your mech for the most part unique, wich is nice.the community is nothing special as far as i can tell but if you are like me and dont really care either way you will have a great time.

												Let me start by saying that this game has a lot of flaws, including but not limited to:-Getting your 100-ton death machine stuck on a small, unrendered pebble is occasionally a thing.-Getting your 100-ton death machine stuck on a small, rendered piece of gutter is a thing.-Trees stop railcannons, lasers, missiles, and autocannons, but will never hinder movement, even if they are saplings.-There are only ~25% of the mechs in the battletech universe available for play.-Clans don't get a lot of their guns.-Missiles are broken, albeit still useable with a great deal of effort.-Certain weapons are misused-Glitches can cause issues with the HUD and other important gameplay aspects-""Rebalancing"" measures often cause problems rather than solve them. For example, there are two factions in the Battletech universe (during the era the game takes place in); Clan, high tech badasses who use GMO troops and lasers, and the Inner Sphere, who have more resources, mechs, land, and everything, really. In the tabletop game, the Clan's superior guns and tech are offset naturally by going up against seas of richer opponents. In MWO, the Clans have to deal with the IS advantages, but are often left without most of their advantages. I understand that this is mostly to allow a 1 Clan : 1 IS ratio in fights. But I think the game could be made far more dynamic by ""de-nerfing"" Clans and giving IS more troops per fight, thus making Clans and IS require different playstyles and tactics. Presently, there isn't a huge difference between Clan and IS, which is just a shame, as there's just SO MUCH wasted potential.But this game is an excellent one, despite its flaws. Why?+Great community.+You can blow giant robots to bits with other giant robots.+The game has rebindable conrols that work reasonably well with keyboard and mouse, joystick, or controller. +It's ""pay to not play"" and so anyone who tries to ""pay to win"" will find themselves lacking in skill, which is a great offset.+They add new mechs about every 1-2 months. These are available for 1-2 months as ""paid only"" and then can be purchased with in-game money. +None of the mechs are in the ""invincible"" or ""overly broken"" category. Some may say ""you can't have it both ways"" when talking about this and what I mentioned with the Clans, and that may well be so. Still, it's a shame to see your favorite mechs artificially nerfed or given tech they didn't have. The IS is also a victim here, as they lack things like their C3 advanced targeting computer, and are instead given a ""command console"".+The controls are really good.+Customizing your mechs is SO fun. You can adjust the armor point-by-point, shedding tenths of a ton in order to fit just a little more ammo on, and it's made so that you can spend years tweaking a mech without ever feeling like you hit ""perfection"" since builds are always being changed to counter the latest trends.+For all the mechs they have, only THREE fall above the power curve, and they all have some detracting factor that evens them out, like the Adder lacking jump jets, or the Ice Ferret having a bad loadout.+Almost any of the mechs can be used to great effect.+The game encourages teamwork, and you will never win without it.+There's never a ""correct answer"" in any situation. If I send in a really big mech and three medium sized mechs, you might want to kill the smaller ones first and quickly, or beat the big guy to a pulp. Either way, you take a lot of damage. But if you have lighter mechs than I do, you might be able to outmanuver them and take no damage. Or you might have heftier mechs to kill me first and still live.+Money can be made really fast, and you can get mechs for in-game currency really quickly.+Teamwork and tactics will often beat skill. The clever, charismatic commander will find that his enemies pose little threat when the enemy can be placed at any sort of disadvantage.+The maps are well made and only one or two are ""bad"". *Glares at Terra Therma*Now, CW Phase 3 is purported to fix many glitches on release. I'll change this review accordingly. This game is free, and you're short-changing yourself to not give it a shot if you like giant robots.			"

												Absolutely fantastic gameplay with tons of variations you can do your mech. TBH its a bit intimidating to get started but just pick a ""trial"" mech and go. Save your money at the beginning. Dont buy anything till you have completed your 25 Cadet matches and you know EXACTLY what you want to build into your mech. Eyefinity is great in game, but messes up the main menu and spectating options a little. Still worth doing.			"

												This is a fun-to-play multiplayer game that I believe is in sync with the  Battletech universe.  You can customize your 'mech with an array of weapons, items, and, if you want to spend actual money, paints.  The home menu interface is confusing untill you play it for a few days, then it is simple enough.  One reason that I like to play this game is that, if you are good enough, you don't have to spend any actual money at all and you don't have to pay any fees to keep playing.  This game is complex, but fun once you master it.			"

												TLDR: The game developer is $hit, resulting in a poor game.The game is dying. This is mostly due to an inept developer (PGI) that is incapable of any thoughtful improvements. They produce 'mech packs which they sell for money. When these packs are released, they are unbeatable (pay to win), and then they balance (nerf) them three months later when they are released to the free-to-play crowd. Rinse and repeat. This money making action is in lieu of any improvements to the game engine, game play, maps, weapons, etc.Feel free to play it, just don't spend any real money.P.S. Did anyone notice that is game is Mechwarrior Online TM ? Who puts a TM after a game title except an a**hole developer?			"

												Game seems to be ok but with all games these days it appears you will need to spend a fair amount of time in training. I don't have the slightest clue as to how to build my own mech or be able to choose something besides the trial mechs. I can see how this game would be very entertaining once you make the initial time investment in video watching, tutorials and practice. There also seems to be a glitch where a ""file error"" window pops up. I uninstalled and re-installed thinking it was a install flaw but it wasn't. I remember playing the Mechwarrior game years ago on my playstation and that was a kickass game. This appears to be very similar yet they've picked it apart and have done everything they can to make every little facet of the game as difficult as possible. Personally, I really just want to play a game, not devote hours, days and weeks just learning how to play it.			"

												Probably one of the most comprehensively balanced multiplayer games ive played. The matchmaking seems to be spot on and matches are consistently tactical and thrilling.  A huge variety of mech's backed up by an even larger variety of mods, addons, weapons.  You can tweak your mech's to your preferred playstyle and more importantly, take premium Mech's out for trial. The community is great, the surrounding ecosystem of forums, Smurphys Mechlab and wide variety of clan specific pages remind me a lot of the commiunity around EVE.Overall, one of the most consistently fun multiplayer experiences I have had. I dont even mind the grind for credits and skills simply because I get to drop into battles and mash other players in walking tanks bristling with lazers.			"

												I have been playing this game for years, and really enjoy it.if you are looking for a simple shooter look elsewhere, this is a complecated game with a lot of diferant mechinics which you will need to learn if you want to be sucessful.think of it like a tank game, the Mechs are giant robots on which the legs move inderpendantly of the torso and arms where the guns are mounted, initialy you will be using ""trial Mechs"" which are player designed builds on a variaty of diferant Mech types, after completing the tutorial (I strongly recomend doing the tutorial because it does cover the basics and rewards you with 5 million cbills) and the first 25 games you should have 18-20 million Cbills (earned ingame money) enough to buy and outfit any Mech you want, or 2-3 less expensive Mechs, after the first 25 your earnings slow down.on any Mech you can change the weapons for whatever you want provided it has the relevent hardpoints and tonage available, Omnimechs have fixed engine and some other equipment but can swop e.g. an arm, leg, side torso or head to change the hardpoints, Battlemechs have fixed hardpoints but you can change all the equipment, including engine and upgrades, most of which are a tradeoff internal space for tonnage.some Mechs can be realy expensive to upgrade, most Light Mechs look cheep to purchase but you will have to spend double the purchase price upgrading it to get it combat ready.the comunity is extremely helpful, so if you have any questions visit the new player help forum where veteran players will try to answer all your questions.this game is not pay to win, the ""premium"" Mechs are no better than the regualr ones, they just offer faster earnings, all real money gets you is time saving, cosmetic or early access (getting new Mechs a few months before they become available for cbills) in natureif after that information you are still interested please give it a try			"

Has a wide variety of mechs that suit each persons needs, whether that be fast movement and scouting, support spotting, high damaged support, tank damage or tank damage and high damage output.The immersion that I get from playing this game is not like any other game that I have played before, it grips me into the experience and makes me believe I am inside one of these mechs.There are no abusive text chats that I have seen so far in the total 2.3 hours I have played this game, only supportive unlucky man or nice shooting.I may not be the most experienced player but I highly recommend this game to anyone who maybe having thoughts of whether to play it or not. It is free so why not just try it? You may like the a lot.			"

												As a long time HAWKEN fan, I avoided this game as I constantly heard pay to win and outlandish mech pricing claims.Having just started playing, one thing I can say is this is no Hawken and I was wrong to draw comparisons. This is much more of a simulation experience and not a FPS - in the style of something like Elite: Dangerous or World of Tanks. It has a slow, deliberate pace focusing on the strength of the unit and not the individual.It's deep and complex but once you buy and outfit your first mech (which can be done straight away) you absolutely can compete with those who have been playing since the beta. A few novice light mechs can take down or disable any Behemoth, if they work together and target the right areas.If you're a big badass robot fan like me who was really skeptical about about Mechwarrior Online, now's the time to give it a try. It's not perfect and the interface is pretty clunky but on the battlefield, where it counts, Mechwarrior Online is the game we all remember.			"

As a vet player from the original closed beta days, I can tell you that it HAS gotten better. The UI has improved a lot. Matchmaking is WAY better than before. Community Warfare still needs work. The map and mode selecting I don't like that much, but that's just me. :)  Some very classic BattleTech mechs are coming and some are already here. There are many vet players like myself, who are willing to help new players enjoy the game we enjoy. Take your time and learn how to play. Don't rush it. Have a question? Just ask us, and we will help you. Yeah this isn't much of a review. But it's a fun game. GO DOWNLOAD IT ANY START KILLING GIANT ROBOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Don't worry about the negative reviews, it's just salty long time players who are struggling.The game has a good hard learning curve, you'll need patience to gather a foundation of suitable META mechs to play with and compete well. Look up meta builds and good mechs, join a unit to play with and learn. Playing with people is better than playing alone.Buy mech packages once you know if you want to play Innersphere or Clans.You will get stomped in pub matches and community warfare often, learn to move around and not sit still !GL HF !

												MW3 nastalgia.Play a Cata A1 Missile boat. Ran out of ammo. proceeded to run around and distract/tank shots while team mates around me dropped the Mechs. after getting them down to a single light, i took an opportunity and pinned the silly little chicken while my team pounded him with a hail of fire. Funny Business aside, this is at first glance a battle arena ""shooter"". However, you have to think with this one. if you're not a MW fan then you may fumble with the controls initially but just think that its a tank. the Tutorial is quick but you learn the basics. This is definitely a good one to play, especially Fans of the universe. The major Drawback in my opinion, is the lack of Modes and maps. it has somewhere between 5-8 maps but only 3 modes, Assault, Conquest, and Skirmish. There could be a bigger selection of Game modes and a few more maps and this would be a lot better. Hawken, another F2P Mecha shooter, has several modes and a hanful of maps. the mode selection is what caught me on that game. If a lower budget Mech shooter like Hawken can have multiple modes why doesn't MWO have more? In conclusion, I think this is a great Mech Shooter. its not the simple shooter mechanics, it stays true to the MechWarrior playstyle. the MW3 Nastalgia hit my in the gut hard. The game suffers from the lack of Modes, a few more would really benefit this game.			"

The gameplay is amazing and for a competitive game the community is surprisingly helpful and non-toxic. The game is very heavy on teamwork, which is refreshing in this world of games where you just go around and do your own thing. You'll find your teammates to be usually helpful and there's a built-in voice chat system when in a match so you're able to communicate more easily with your team.

												First off: This isn't a twitch game. Being a good button-masher isn't going to make you a good player.Second: This isn't Call of Duty. You can't carry your team's weight. Teamwork is necessary, so use that option to talk to your team.Third: Big stompy robots with big weapons are awesome. This game takes it to a new level in the sheer variety of what you can do to make your big stompy robots YOURS. You have a mech with two ballistic hard points that has enough slots for a pair of AC 20s, go ahead and slap 'em on. Not to mention the game is balanced. Having a big mech isn't an automatic win.Fourth: The game really is free to play. It isn't pay to win. You pay for things like different colors for your mech or some cockpit bling. Maybe you just really want that mech right now, so you can use actual money. There is not one thing you need to buy to be an actual, competitive player.			"

												SOOOOOOO, i have spent a happy amount of time playing this game and my conclusion is, it's reallly fun. However it's not the kind of game that's intuitive. Sure you'll eventually figure stuff out but in process you'll probs waste a good ammount of ingame currency like i did. So watch/ read some guides on what some mech builds look like as well as look at some stratagies for keeping yourself alive. I recomend watching some videos by SideStrafe. He's a pretty savy Mech warrior and you could learn a few things from him. Here is a link to his ""begginers guid to customization"" vid:

			Having trouble customizing your first few mechs in MechWarrior Online? Then this guide is for you! I cover the basics as well as the thought process that goes into outfitting a chassis that suits...		

 Does this sound like a hassle? Perhaps a little, but the game really shines in its long term attractivness. The combat is more strategic and slower than other shooters (that being said, you will probs find youself in some really fast paced situations pretty often, especially if you are a light mech), there is a TON of stuff to unlock so you'll be kept busy, and you can get pretty occupied with customizing your mechs as well. Also, don't permanently sign your allegience to a faction till you farmed them all for some free mechbays. After that, THEN choose the faction you like. I hope the review was helpfull m8s.			"

												Free to play tactical FPS shooter.  The pace is slower than most FPS games, and it is brutal in punishing poor tactics, and lack of teamwork.  I enjoy the less twitchy nature of the gameplay, and have been a rabid battletech fan since the early 90s. This game definitely scratches that itch, and I find the moderately steep learning curve to have ultimately been rewarding once I got the handle of the game mechanics.  If you are at all interested in this genre / flavor of game (big stompy robots) give it a go.			"

												As a long time fan of Battletech / the Mechwarrior, I'm glad to see the franchise has been picked up and dusted off. I've been playing this consistanly game for 3 years or so now (using the stand alone client) So I've come to share my opinon of this game as a true vet.So what is Mechwarrior about? From the very beginning, it's always been about piloting giant, multi-ton battlemechs into battle. Smashing trees, stomping cars, high-powered futuristic weapons. Carnage. Destruction! Battlemechs operate as walking tanks. You can move the torso independently from the legs. And you can Aim Arm mounted weapons independently from weapons mounted in the torso. It takes a certain finesse to get the hang of it, but it does lead to a pretty fun experience in battle. That said, MWO is a solid tactical shooter. It can be a bit slower paced as you really have to be able to land consistent shots in the same component location to effectively destroy your opponents armor so you can get to the internals, who will be doing their best to spread that damage all over his mech. But on the other hand it can be brutally fast paced when a coordinated team focuses down targets. Though there are a few lone wolf roles that can be quite disruptive to the enemy team, Team work as well as positioning and situation awareness is Key in this game. It cannot be ignored that there is a learning curve to Mechwarrior. It does take a certain finnese outside of twitch shooting. It can be frustrating if you're new and trying to get the hang of the game, as it does take a while to learn proper maneuvering, how to manage your heat and preserve your armor. There are no respawns in MWO, but if you play it right, most mechs can take quite a beating. Once you get the hang of it, combat is seamless and satisfying. Another crucial part of the Mechwarrior franchise that will keep you coming back for more is the Mechlab. Here you can browse thoughscores of available mechs for purchase (Most mechs and ALL weapons / equipment in the game can be purchased with in game currency that you earn in battle), choose your ideal mech, strip it down and build it up to your preferred role / play-style, finding that balance between heat management, firepower, mobility, ammo and any other support tech. Here is where you will fine tune your mechs and try to squeeze after last bit of performance out of it to fit your needs.  Each chassis is different. They will have different hardpoint types / locations and / or quirks that may make them excel in some areas. PGI has done a great job of making each mech not feel exactly the same as another so there is lots of variation to be found.Mechwarrior also offers several types of weapons that you can choose from to equip on your battlemech. They fall into 3 main categories. - Energy - Those are your lasers and particle projection cannons. They come in different sizes and beam duration lenghts for different roles. Damage is done instantly to your target. But damage is DOT, so you have to hold the beam on a specific spot on your target to get the full damage to that location. Energy weapons generate the most heat but require no ammo.-Missiles - Again, come in different sizes and salvos. Short and long range versions. Can end up weighing a lot. variants that can lock on to an enemy do less damage. Generally low heat, but can get hot with long periods of sucessive fire.-Ballsitics - your Autocannons and Guass rifles of different calibers. Require lots of space and tonnage to equip on your mech. Rounds do have varying travel time and range depending on the calibre of the round. Ballistcs that don't burst fire will do their full rated damage on impact if within optimal range. Generally very low heat weapons.Mechs come with combinations of these hardpoints and it's up to the player to figure out what works best for them.

			Trolling, harassing and thinning the herds with the CERPPC shadowcat.		

Above:Sniping and harassing in the shadowcat: Medium Omnimechs equipped with Dual Extended range PPC's. Heat managment and positioning are key on this build.That said there are 4 classes of mechs to choose from.20-35 tons - Your nimble annoying light mechs that will pick and peck at you. Infuriate you! Low armor, low to decent firepower, high speed and maneuverability. Very effective against slower targets. 40-55 tons - Medium mechs which as less mobile but carry more armor and firepower. By lore, they are the workhorses of the battlefield.60-75 tons - Heavy Mechs, Good armor, good firepower and decent mobility.80-100 tons - Assault Mechs - Expensive, Slow, lumbering heavily armed behemoths of destruction. With just as heavy armor.As far as DLC goes, there is a lot out there. But you don't really need to get any of it. New players only have access to trial mechs, most of which are decent but cannot be customized, but new players also earn money bonuses for their 1st 25 games. Completing the tutorials will also net a nice tidy amount of cbills which should allow new players to buy 1 or 2 maybe even more Mechs of their down. And yes, any mech in the game ouside of hero mechs can be purchased with in game currency. Hero mechs are usually not the preferred variant of a mech, they may have a couple hard-point changes and come with their down custom camospec and a 30% boost to money earned in matches. The only thing that a new player that is into the game should buy is Mechbays - you only have 4 to start with, and if you want more mechs you'll have to sell mechs to free up bays or by more mechbays. Mechbays can also be earned in game by playing faction warfare, completing weekend challenges and more. Sounds and graphics are all nicely done, though the game could still benefit from some optimization in some areas. This is still a work in process and there is new content in the making and improvements are always being added.I'll end this review with another video of some of the sights and sounds of mechwarrior.  Hope to see you on the battlefield Future Mechwarriors!

Download this game. Play it. It's free.I definitely recommend this game to any fan of:BattleTech UniverseStrategic FPS (more Battlefield, less CoD)Rompy Stompy Robots with LAS0RZThe mechanics of this game are similar to previous MechWarrior titles. You pilot a Battlemech, have to deal with ammunition for your guns and missiles, and manage heat and cooldowns for your energy weapons. There's 4 classes of battlemech (light, medium, heavy, assault) and a variety of roles that each can play, based on loadout, which for mechs you own is fully customizeable. There are two multiplayer game modes: Quick Play and Faction Play. Quick Play is where the majority of pilots spend their time, dropping into 12v12 matches on a variety of maps and with varying objectives (Skirmish/Deathmatch, Conquest, Domination/King of the Hill, Assault/Base Capture). Faction Play allows pilots to participate more in the lore/IP; by signing on with one of the Inner Sphere houses or one of the Clan tribes as a loyalist or mercenary, and shape the Mechwarrior universe (unfortunately, in practice this is not as cool as it sounds - more on this below). I'm 100 hours in as of this review, here's what I like and don't like so far:Pros:Free to play, but not pay to win. More grind involved if you don't want to invest any $.A very strategic FPS (if you're a fan of World of Tanks, you'll enjoy this)Tons of diversity when it comes to the different classes of mechs, as well as the weapons and equipment you attach to themVery similar feel to the old MechWarrior titlesThe community, from what I've seen, is pretty forgiving to rookies, and if you ask for help, people will help you. As a former League of Legends player, this blew my mind.There are pretty regular community events, in the month I've been playing there's been 2 (as well as a sale on mechs), that allow you to obtain pay-only items as rewards for performance. Rompy Stompy Robots with LAS0RZ!Cons:Because the playerbase is smaller than a lot of other F2P titles (daily uniques range between 1200 and 2500), you're usually in matches with people of varying skill level. Their matchmaking service wouldn't be able to launch games in an acceptable time frame otherwise.If you're a big fan of the IP (read the books, played all the previous titles, maybe played the tabletop game), their 'Faction Play' mode doesn't delve much into the lore. In fact, Faction Play is difficult to get into as a rookie pilot, as you're typically up against pre-made teams who've been playing together for awhile.Learning curve - not so much if you're familiar with Tank mechanics a la Battlefield, or old Mechwarrior titles, but definitely takes some hours to 'git gud' at.Overall, if you've got a few hours a week (or more) to kill, this is one of the better F2P 'puter games I've played. The publisher definitely doesn't get everything right all the time, but I think overall they've done a good job, and I will definitely be playing this game for awhile. Not convinced? Watch this. "

												I cant really promote this game.  Dont let the short playtime confuse you. I'm a huge mechwarrior fan from the old days and as such this game was what I hoped for..or at least I thought.  I was an early backer / founder and put a fair few hundred hours into the game  prior to it being added to Steam.  Soon enough it became apparent that the games a cash grab rather than offering content and  little has changed with the game since being added to Steam. The Devs are more interested in selling you mechs rather than adding any form of gameplay. Feel free to play and enjoy without buying any of the ridiculous overpriced mechs on sale or paying for premium but you'll soon find it's an unbalanced grindfest (i.e constant weapon rebalancing) with little to do but play the same handfull of maps over and over again. But dont take my word for it. Just go google the controversy that has followed this game since it's early days. The game is about milking you for cash for mechs and paint jobs, not giving you content to use said mechs in.			"

												Actually very good for a free to play game (or really even for a full price AAA title.) You could very easily play this game and not spend a dime if you wished to. This and Star Trek Online have the best 'free to play' models that I have seen. Combat is very fun and engaging. Obviously there is a wide variety of skill level in opponents so you won't win every time, but you likely won't lose all the time either. You're always in a large team, so if you struggle, you can always stick with the pack and up your chances. Going off on your own is generally not a good idea.If I had to say something bad about it, it can be a little complicated at first, it has a somewhat steep learning curve and that can be intimidating to new players. It's best not to spend any of your early money on a mech, play the free 'trial' mechs until you know what style you like and then buy something that fits your style. There are A LOT of Mechs to choose between and you're likely going to have to watch some videos and do some research, it's not a simple game. I'm not normally a guy who likes PvP type games, but this game is great. If you can get 2 or 3 friends and travel in a pack it's even better.			"

												I enjoy it, even with only 2 'Mechs of my own, and low FPS. It does get annoying though... it felt more like a grind with how many battles I have to enter into, because i get low scores, because I die REALLY fast. But that is due ot bad piloting, and because I only run 2 Jenners (light Mechs with certain very weak ""critical"" spots"".It's been a while since I've played it, but I have a LOT more time in it than Steam has on record, because I played it before it came to Steam.Still can be enjoyed, especially with a good, coordinated team.Sorry for the lack of description. I must return to this review.			"

												Elite Founder here - I supported the game late in its closed beta period.  It showed amazing promise back then.  Its a shame that, 4 years later, they've only put a coat of polish on a busted machine instead of actually addressing the core problems with the game.  PGI has always been more interested in producing monetizable content than actually making the game that founders like myself were sold on.  Matchmaking is a mess, always has been. Poor engine implementation, with a major CPU bottleneck, which is doubly sad considering that this game was in beta using this very engine back in 2012 and has done little to optimize these issues.  The Publisher, PGI, has engaged in a variety of shady, scummy business practices; serial overpromising leading to broken promises, a failed Kickstarter for a Star Citizen clone in 2014 while simutaneously pleading poverty and lack of manpower on MWO's promised feaures not being finished (aka ""The Great Founders' Reunion""), solely focusing on producing more monetizable 'mechs, all while failing to actually optimize the core game as promised.Don't even get me started on balance, the generally terrible way PGI has interacted with the community, or the generally haphazard why this thing has been handled since beta.  It's abundantly clear that PGI just started throwing it all against a wall to see what stuck.  What was promised to be the definitive battletech expirence became little more than a microtransaction-laden esports-style arena shooter.BTW, this game is literally the reason I will NEVER purchase an early supporter pack from any developer, ever again.  Ever.			"

												Been playing MWO for years now. It is my favorite free to play game hands down. If you like fps,give this game a try. It can be a little daunting. It is fairly complex. There are endless variations for loadouts on mechs and play styles that go best with certain loadouts. You have to balance power, cooling,ammo,rate of fire,etc. You have to put in effort if you want to have fun. This means learning how to play your chosen mech and unlocking upgrades for mech to give you a bit more of an edge. Modules for mech also play a big roll. To give a couple of examples. These can be consumables in the form of coolant shots that greatly reduse heat in one shot or weapon modules that increase the rate of fire or range on a particular weapon. Your loadouts are fully customizable. This is a great game!			"

												Well here goes Jocks..... I was many many many years ago a Battlemeck/Battleteck/Mechwarrior table top player. And have always followed most games based on the universe. And this game i've been following since its launch.. not her on steam... but since the first trials and errors for the pas couple of years.... Well all i can say is congrats to the Devs... a game with so much content (f2p mind you), the faction system finally implemented, new mechs everywhere galore.It captures the feel of being a real meck pilot, down to the minute details, and they're adding those details all the time. So all i can add is get this game, learn how to survire and thrive.. cause it aint easy in the 30th millenium. You'll get stomped on, burned, obliterated and much more... but when youll score that perfect cockpit shot and take down an Atlas with one shot..... oouuuhhhhhhhhhiwwwwiiiiiiiiii!!!! Also, encourage the devs, get some points, add some flare or colors to your mech... anything to show them that this game is awesome!!!!!!Congrats.... now DROP DROP DROP!!!!!!			"

												The game has been out for 4 years and it still feels like it is in beta. I have played early acess games that feel more complete than this game. If they didnt have Mechwarrior in the name PGI would have gone under a long time ago. Support is powerless to help with anything so if you have to put a ticket in expect that it will take a week for them to get back with you and when you do they act like you are inconveniencing them by having a problem. Maybe in 5 years it will be a finished game and i will change my review to reflect that.			"

												From FAKE STEAM REVIEWS to vote brigading on Reddit to FAKING MATCHES and/or spoofing players in the game, PGI spends more time trying to make this LOOK like a successful game than actually trying to make a successful game.As for those that do play, they are the Absolute worst, most TOXIC COMMUNITY I've ever encountered gaming. MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF HACKS, trolling and griefing, all allowed by uncaring and mostly absent admins. And if you find out they're faking matches and spoofing players, the ADMINS THEMSELVES WILL HARASS YOU UNTIL YOU LEAVE THE GAME.I wasted my time becoming proficient in this game because I love the genre, and now I can't hear the word mech without feeling disgusted.

												quickie review:I'm really enjoying this game.A couple things:1) This game is a lot slower and more methodical then your standard FPS2) your mech can take a lot more punishment then your standard space marine/ww II soldier.  Its OK to take some hits.3) there is a rather steep learning curve with this game.  You will be killed.  Don't get discouraged.  You'll get better with practice.  Your first kills and wins will be SUPER satifying.4) This game is very playable without spending any real money.  The tutorial and your first 25 matches give you extra in-game currency (C-bills) which can be used to buy a mech or two.5) join a faction and dip your toe into Community Warfare (youtube: 


YouTube™ Video:  

			Views: 0		



getting to level 2 in a faction nets you a free mech bay.6) Mechs that can only be purchased with real money will either be: A) not as good as mechs that can be purchased with in-game2 earnable currency, or B) will eventually be available for purchase with C-bills.7) This game has two currencies: C-bills and MC.  You earn C-bills by playing.  MC is purchased with real money.  The vast majority of the content can be purchased with C-bills.If that doesn't scare you, or if it sound interesting, give it a try.

												I've played this one since the open beta and really enjoy the combination of tinkering with the mech you bring into battle and the slightly slower pace of gameplay as a fairly tactical shooter (the mechanics mean you take quite a few hits to die in game which, in turn, slow things down a bit). There is a good range of different successful gameplay tactics and a huge range of customisable different mechs you can bring to a fight. After several teething issues (pre-steam, so don't worry) game balance is now pretty good between the two main factions (""inner sphere"" and ""clan"") and the online population are fairly friendly in a wallaby-name-calling sort of fashion (see Gh1d0ra's review later!). The ""storyline"" part of the game, ""community warfare"", is fun with much more structured in-game challenges. However as it is pretty much ""end game"" content, it works best as part of a pre-organised team (lots of these accessible via the MWO website community links) and needs a top-line mech.It's main limitations are the initial learning curve and a limited number of maps and game types. Hopefully the developers will continue to respond to this in the next few months. Personally, I'm really hoping for some sort of intermediate gameplay between the random quickplay maps and the involved CW game (some sort of FFA deathmatch tournament would be great...)  All-in-all, it is good fun, especially as a free-to-play game, and I would recommend having a go through the initial cadet bonus stage, customing a bought mech until it is suitably bristling with lasers, ballistic weapons and missiles, blowing up the opposition team/going down in a blaze of glory and seeing if you enjoy it!

												I started playing MWO back in Closed Beta and have played it consistently since that time. It has gone through a LOT of changes and is STILL undergoing changes (which isn't a bad thing). For me, it is still a lot of fun to play.Is it perfect? Of course not. Few, if any games are perfect. Is it Pay to Win? Not at all. There is nothing you can purchase for real money that gives you any advantage over those who use ingame currency. It may give you the opportunity to play new mechs early, but other than that, no advantages at all. All the Weapons available in the game work the same no matter on what Mech they are equipped (now, Clan weapons work differently from Inner Sphere but they work the same across all Clan mechs). There are no ""Gold Weapons"" or ""Gold Ammunition"".Why do mechs cost so much? That is indeed a good question and one I wish they would explain myself! Personally, I feel they would be better off selling them for less money to sell more but I guess they figure their price point currently maximizes their profits. And they are a company out to make a profit (who isn't)! That said, every mech (other than Hero and Champion Mechs) are available to purchase at some point using ingame currency that you can earn while playing the game.Hero Mechs? P2W!While it is true those mechs are only available for real money, they aren't P2W mechs. They are just mechs with a special paint/camo, and offer a Cbill % Bonus to your earnings. Hero mechs will have a weapon loadout that is not available on any other current variant usually but then suffer from some other disadvantage (perhaps it can't carry as many weapons as the others). But, the key point here ... all weapons perform the same, regardless of the Mech on which they are installed. So a Medium Laser is the same across all the Inner Sphere Mechs.Champion MechsChampion Mechs are exactly the same mech as their normal variant, just with a (C) designation and a boost to your Experience earnings. Trial MechsThese are what you will start with if you do not purchase any mechs with real money. They are free for you to use. You just cannot modify their loadouts whatsoever. You don't own them but you can play them to earn Cbills to purchase your own mechs. Learning CurveMWO is going to be wildly different from most other FPS type games. It is supposed to be a Mech Simulator, whatever they mean by that. Anyway, there will be a pretty steep learning curve for this game! To me, it was worth it and makes it so much more fun and involved. You have to learn how to Torso Twist to spread damage across your mech to increase your survivability. What this means is the upper half of your body can turn independently from your legs. You can be running one way and facing another (the degree of twist is dependent on the mech...some can turn more than others). Mastering the ability to Twist your Torso independent of your legs is a MUST.Aiming Reticles. You will likely have 2 sets of reticules. Your Arms can also move somewhat independently of your torso (depends on Mech) to some degree. The small Circle reticule is where your Arm mounted weapons will fire while the + reticule is where your torso mounted weapons will fire. Oh, the OTHER thing you have to keep in mind is WHERE on your mech these weapons are mounted as far as height goes. While your Reticule may not appear to be obstructed by terrain, low-mounted weapons may not fire over the hill you are standing behind (for example).Heat ManagementThis is going to be one of your MAJOR things to master in MWO. Every weapon you fire (with the exception of the Gauss Rifle) generates some measure of Heat. Your Mech can only handle a certain amount of heat before you risk shutting down and/or doing internal damage to your mech. Each mech has Heat Sinks that add to your heat capacity and also contribute to dissapating the heat you have accumulated. So, the greater the number of weapons you fire at once, the greater the amount of heat you build up. Also, the faster you fire, the more you generate heat. Heat is your biggest concern and the thing you HAVE to learn to manage.Ghost HeatThis is something the developers added as a ""balance tool"". It's not very well described in the game. What this means is they have set up a limit to the number of weapons of the same type that can be fired at the same time without incurring a ""Ghost Heat Penalty"". If you fire more than the allowed number at the same time, then you incur additional heat, hence the term ""ghost"". This penalty increases quickly based on how many more weapons past the limit you fire (so 3 more than the limit is penalized much more than 1 past the limit). You will get an indicator in the Mech Lab that warns you of the limit if you have more weapons of that type installed on the mech. For example, you can fire 4 SRM 4 missile packs without a penalty but if you fire 5 at the same time, you start incurring the Ghost Heat penalty. This is only if you fire them all at the same time. If you fire them one after the other (Chain Fire) you are fine or if you fire in smaller groups and pause at least .5 seconds between you are fine as well. So, it is a rather complicated game to learn but once you begin to understand and master the skills, it becomes second nature. The game still has some improving to do...matchmaking isn't the best in the land and the game really needs a Lobby available full time in my opinion, but they are slowly getting those things added. I find the core game a lot of fun to play.			"

												Let me start by saying that I have played this game more or less continually since closed beta.Everyone asks if it is pay to win. No. It is NOT pay to win. Pay for convenience, absolutely. I spent the first year or so that I played without dropping a dime. It will take you time to build up a large reserve of cash and mechs if you don't invest anything but you absolutely can. Sure there are a few things that you can only buy with real world cash, about two dozen mechs, mech bays and paint. The mechs are nothing special, the bays can be won in some challenges/in-game achievements and the paint is purely aesthetics.The next problem I see people have is that there is a large learning curve. The game has become much more newbie friendly recently with the addition of a training academy tutorial and a tier system that will help to place you with similar skill level pilots. The issue many people have coming into the game is expecting a Hawken or CoD like shooter. This game is about tactics and attrition. You will need to hit your opponent more than once to bring him down at the same time avoiding as much damage as possible. My number one recommendation is to join a unit. Your peers are going to be a HUGE help with teaching tactics, mech building and the like.There is also a quickly growing competitive side to the game with PGI even hosting a tournament with a 100k cash purse. There are player driven leagues with cash prizes and a shout casts on twitch and with the new spectator tools allow for some really fun to watch battles.Overall I strongly recommend this game.			"

												How i got to MWO? - SKIP it if you dont like personal introductory stories. Or else be my guest.I was looking through my games while moving and then i remembered I had a MW 4 - Vengeance CD somewhere. Didnt find it though but then I had an idea. Lets look it up on the interwebs. I found out no MW4 Vengeance around anymore so I read somewhere there was a MW ONLINE and then researched and did a very scientific survey - nah, just kidding - no survey but i really got excited and tried it out - Failed so badly that i tried more and more and after a couple of months MWO was my thing. I am in a very eligible unit but lawschool means sooooo much playtime while exams.Joined the battle February 2015.My Steam playtime doesnt represent my actual play time.I joined in on steam and do play on both the MWO Client and Steam Client.Have seen some changes til then and mostly they have been well received.*Mostly been playing quickplay and just got into community warfare - faction play lately so this review is quickplay originated.AND I am not going to talk about pug play because i am a pug myself. My experience is heavily positive but sometimes i encounter people that cause me to lose my temper.Because it has gone under changes various times i dont recall that much of em.*The ones i remember are the mechlab changes which now provide a good overview at everything. positive.*I definitely am a fan of the c-bill grinding but that only goes perfectly with premium time.So long i have been investing in the hero and champion mechs meaning i spent money in this f2p concept. - kinda negative.*I dont regret spending money on premium content but i figured it would be a little better if the game didnt have the mc thing going. This then would mean that without veterean founders the game might not even have made its release.So thank you veteran founders. You da real mvps out there.*if sales are going on - buy as much as possible especially if you get to win mc from events definitely spend em on mechbays. - definitely positive.*Also getting into faction play and achieving higher ranks will get you the MC and free Mechbays necessary. dont say no to free stuff ;)-BUT its very hard at the beginning even with the Cadet-bonus. At least that was my experience back in the day. - negative.THEREFORE definitely get to know other players and play together. We are a newbie friendly community and we'll help.-I am kinda upset that there arent any champions or hero mechs available for c-bills. There should have been just a couple heros/champs for c-bills at least. I am looking forward to every event and sale.You need to invest some serious amount of time and thereforeit gets really addicting - you ll spend your day playing and playing and playing.Remember to drink and eat and sleep enough.

												I used to hate this game- I drove around the 50 ton hunchback because it was the first mech I drove that I broke 100 damage in. When it came out again on steam recently I sold my hunchback for a different mech that suited me much more, love the game now. In short this game varies a lot from mech to mech and weapon to weapon and just when you start to think one playstyle or build is boring you find another one that you thought wouldn't be viable because you built it while laughing maniacally to your friends. This game is what you make of it and while some things are marginally unbalanced skill and ""comfort"" (one-ness?) with mech you are driving can overcome any tiny imbalance's that the game throws at you.

Very responsive. The mechs look amazing. The community overall is very relaxed compared to other games. There is still a competitive scene for those who are looking for one. There are plenty of resources and knowledgeable players willing to teach new folks if you look in the right place. I love collecting mechs and customizing their camo and colors and can't wait for the decal system to come out. If you ever played a Mechwarrior game back in the '90s, you need to give this a try.

												Download and play if:-you played a MechWarrior game before-you like strategic shooters-you are a fan of simulation games-you like driving a tank but can't relate because it doesn't have legs like you-you are cool with losing a big portion of your time to reading strategies and thinking about this game-you can work together with 11 other people for ten minutes at a timeWe all know you have to ""grind"" your way through f2p titles, but there isn't another game that makes you forget instantly that you are ""grinding"" anything.  Playing Quick Play over and over again to work out your masteries on a chosen 'Mech is just fun.  Your first 20 matches gives you an insane amount of money to buy just about any 'Mech you want, and depending on what class and chassis you pick, you can even get your three variants to achieve mastery.Here's how not ""grindy"" the grind is: I played my first 17 hours and bought three heavy 'Mech variants, and achieved mastery of them without getting bored at all.  In fact, every match that I start, every time I click Quick Play, every time the oh-so-familiar 'Mech computer says ""weapons online, sensors online, all systems nominal"" I get goosebumps like I'm that kid I was back in 1995 when I first played MechWarrior 2, or when I saved my lunch money instead of buying lunch in middle school so that I could buy MechWarrior 4 in 2000.There is near limitless fun you can have just jumping in with Quick Play without ever giving PGI a dime.  Seriously there is not any reason someone who casually wants to shoot big robots in a walking tank would need to spend money.  But once you start finding yourself reading guides, learning strategies, working through your masteries on your first three 'Mechs, something will change.  You'll probably buy a 'Mech bundle, which somehow feels ok, it feels like an even trade, you won't look at your bank account and cringe at that impulse buy for a f2p title and you'll probably get more hours of enjoyment out of those three+ 'Mechs than you would from most $20 title on Steam.Play this game and:-you will become a MechWarrior, when you see the animation of your character booting up the 'Mechs systems and jiggling the controls, you will be transported to that cockpit and your chair is now the pilot's seat-you will call out contacts as they appear on the map, you will work together with your lancemates to flank and confuse and split up the enemy forces-you will turn your head and cringe when you hear ""warning incoming missles""-you will cheer and sound crazy to the people around you when you kill an assault 'Mech while you are piloting a medium or light-you will be late to work and you will lose sleep-you will see lasers converging on a point when you close your eyes			"

												I am not an old school mechwarrior, but I have played this game since 2013 and have enjoyed it immensely.  The community is great (although, there is quite a bit of disagreement between players about the game itself), and it is easy to find a friendly, mature group of people drop with.  People who say there is a learning curve are correct, don't be surprised if on your first drop you find yourself bouncing off walls and dying in a hail of fire.  Stick with it though, the controls are tight once you get a handle on them, and it gives you a sense of satisfaction when you finally get it down enough to effectively pilot a light mech.  I have enjoyed all of the game modes, although I wish there were a few more, and find customizing the mechs with the in game credits you earn to be endlessly enjoyable.  In short, this game is definitely worth a try for free.  (That said, saving up for mechs takes a good deal of time if you are going straight though in game credits and last I checked you do still need to buy mechbays to hold them.)			"

												Great slow-paced shooter  (akin to a World of Tanks, etc) but still needs some work to really capitalize on the deep universe Battletech has to offer. The gameplay is solid with killer Mech designs and and combat that has a strong element of tactical positioning and smart management of various mechanics from heat buildup, one-shot artilleries or airstrikes, memorizing locations of enemy equipment to shoot it off, etc. Sadly, anyone looking to ""exist"" in a time and place in the BT universe will be sorely disappointed. There are A LOT of Mechs but only a small handful of roles that they all share so there really isn't much depth to the core gameplay. Again, the gameplay is solid so as long as you don't mind the ""Warrior"" part being underconstruction, you'll definitely dig the ""Mechs.""Great community (http://reddit.com/outreachhpg), patches like clockwork,  I've been playing it a few hours nearly every night since I started playing 4 years ago with friends and I play with them even today.

												Writing the review from the POV of a mainly solo-queue player who has been around since the beta.Positives:Giant robot death machines.It's free-to-play.The game looks and sounds great, and the designs for the Mechs themselves have never been better.The core mechanics and ""feel"" of the game are fairly solid, with the team deathmatch and conquest game-modes being in a pretty good place right now.Mech customization leads to a particularly compelling meta-game.The weekend challenges can really spice things up a bit, if you are lucky enough to have the time to grind through them.Giant robot death machines.Negatives:The payment model is still far, far too expensive for what is on offer.Balance is still an ongoing issue, leading to a rotating roster of overly powerful ""Meta-Builds"" tending to dominate proceedings. Given the price of outright buying mechs, this can give players willing to pay over the odds a significant headstart in earning a strong gameplay advantage. (In PGI's favour, this aspect of the game has been steadily improving over time.)""Assault"" mode is still a complete waste of time.The auto match-maker appears to take great joy in setting up hilariously lopsided matches.The weekend challenges, while spicing things up a bit, can quickly turn into a chore for those who aren't lucky enough to have a lot of free time to grind at weekends.TLDR:The game, while still having issues relating to balance and pricing, is fun, and it is possible, with a little research and pre-planning, to play successfully as a free player. Just be prepared for some frustrations along the way.			"

												There are already a lot of reviews covering the pro's and con's of the game mechanics.So please read one of these for more details on graphics, game style etc.  MWO is the only game I have played for 3years continuously - ever. The combination of short battles and the Mechlab that allows changing the setup of your warmachine again and again is just addicting. Everybody can find their niche to excel in battle. And once you make some friends in the game and play with them it is just rewarding. You can easily switch between concentrated high performance play and just doing a few drops with a fun build to relax. For me it is my go-to game.

												Terrific game, enjoying every moment of it. If you are familiar with the Mechwarrior franchise, battlestyle-wise the game feels very similar with big bad robots stomping each other. Most matches are done in 12v12s. Each match earns you C-bills, the in-game currency, which you use to buy new mechs or new equipment. There is a great deal of customization offered from the kind of weapons you can opt for, to the different variants of each chassis you can pick from and even down to what color or paint pattern you want on your mech to make it as visually distinguished as possible.One remarkable feature that I have to put out, the community is amazing so far. Most players I have came across are really helpful and patient, save for a few, but those a very small minority. Most players here are polite in response and will gladly help out new players in need. There are plenty of units (aka clans / guilds in layman terms) that are recruiting new players so if you have the time, you may want to check them out on the forums to help you get settled faster into the game.Overall experience: 8.5/10 "

												I've played MechWarrior titles since 1995. It's my favorite genre and I've purchased every title in the series since. A few years ago I played this Open Beta for a couple weeks, and left very disappointed. I thought the title was doomed. But loyal fans spending lots of cash have kept the developers motivated. Improvements were made, so I decided to have another look. I've been back for 3 months now and while it's not the MechWarrior 5 I and many other fans hoped for, it is still quite enjoyable to play in its current state. Fortunately I picked a good time of the year to come back as multiple sales were going on both with in-game and premium currency. I was even motivated to spend some real cash for premium purchases which is out of character for me.So you're here to find out if this title is worth your time? If you love the series or the genre, I would say yes it certainly is worth installing and playing. There is a learning curve if your background is all Player versus A.I. of the previous titles. Humans are infinitely more unpredictable. (that's not saying they are always smarter) If your background is Player versus Player, especially First Person Shooter titles, this game's tactics will be familiar, yet different enough to be a new experience worth trying. You move much slower - depending on the chassis size, have multiple weapon groups to choose from - depending on range and heat levels, and must orient/steer your upper and lower torsos independantly.There is a strong focus on team logistics. You'll see it time and again: a lone wolf playstyle will get you killed as isolated mechs of any size can be overwhelmed with even just a pair of attackers. Then once you're gone, your team has a numbers disadvantage and the odds of them losing rise quickly. If you're the kind of person that likes team-chat, defined combat roles, and focused fire, you'll love this title.The in-game chat is 99.9% adult and respectful. Most are willing to give free advice and understand the challenges of playing the game well. Those that choose to swear/slur or team kill can be easily reported and seem to quickly disappear. The out-of-game community is alive and well. Searching the official forums, youtube, or the relevant reddit sites will give you links to many external resources for role-tactics, mech customization, chassis purchasing advice, social ladders, and just about anything you need to be successful except the actual in-game skill of keeping calm while 12 strangers (or possibly even friends once you've been around a while) are trying to melt your face off.I intend to play this game for quite a while, and I encourage anyone reading this to give the free install a shot. It might just be exactly what you're looking for. It doesn't take long for a new player to have several vehicles in the garage and feel like they can contribute or even turn the tides of a battle. Suit up!			"

												Few hundred hours played before Steam release.On to the game. Do you like the following: Big stompy mechs and sometimes smaller, faster, but less stompy mechs? Firing lazors? Big autocannons? Or perhaps you like being a scumbag who provides ""support"" fire with long range misiles? Creating the most awful awesome custom mech setup? Playing shooters that focus on thinking ahead rather than twitch reflex?If you answered yes to any of these, the game should suit you fairly well. It's a thinking man's shooter with a good ammount of customisation provided within a number of varied mech models. The weapons loadout boils down to four major groups with seemingly minor differences between them, but that still suffices to make for a number of opportunities to make something that feels, plays and is unique and hopefuly suited to how you like to play.Keep in mind though, this game is NOT the following: P2W - you can buy all mech variants for premium currency and there are premium exclusive mechs. That said, the only advantage the premium exclusive mechs really have is making more credits, you can put together a virtually identical mech and often enough a superior one if you like. Money gets you places faster, but given that it's not an easy game to master, going places faster may not be helpful... Easy to master - as mentioned, this isn't easy to master, but the community is relatively helpful and mature, so at least getting the hang of it isn't hard, there's ample tutorials around and plenty of people willing to advise. Developed fast - the game has changed a lot since I first dropped in four years ago, but given how long it's been, I'd say progress could definitely have been faster. Partially forgiven due to behind the scenes problems, but still rather slow.Now that I'm back following the Steam release, I expect to put in quite a few hours once again. Hopefully if you try it, you'll like it. Nothing to lose since it is F2P after all.			"

												This game is ridiculously fun. Giant robots blasting giant robots, not sure how that's bad? I would like to see some of the game modes refined, and the community warfare to have some more depth added, but this is a free game that lets you hop in a 100 ton battlemech and blast other battlemechs. The mech designs are awesome, the maps are pretty good for the most part, there are very real differences between how the different weight classes of mechs play, but all can be effective. I just finished a game in a 50 ton medium mech (CENTURION) with top damage for the match and won a free mech. Also, the laser sounds are soooooooo good. WUB WUB WUB. PEW PEW PEW.I usually play outside of steam (I started with the steam release, but the game works better outside of steam for some reason?) hence my low time played. I've got maybe 100 hrs at this point.Super fun.			"

												First...I've only been playing for about 6 months. (We'll come back to that in a minute).This game is a ""Stompy Robot Shooter"" game. Basically an FPS but with robots of varying size and abilities. In some ways it's like Hawken but less of a 'video game' and more of a simulation. Which is what attracted me after getting burned out from COD (especially it's new Infinite Gymnastics release). So...if you're an FPS guy....this is a good FREE TO PLAY robot FPS. 3 out 5 stars right there with no othere considerations (see below) and it's free...you can spend a LOT of money in microtransactions but you don't have to if you just want to play it casually. Now...If you are a Lore-♥♥♥♥♥ then this game could be bad or good depending on how you want to view it. Yes, it does have some non-cannon parts. Yes, PGI can sometimes play fast and loose with mech design and weapons....but....you can't go from tabletop to video without some changes. I, personally, like the changes.....but those with OCD might not. (More on that in a minute).So...the game itself is pretty much like a lot of FPS games. You have teams. You have certain modes (TDM, Escort, Dom,o etc). Your weapons, while futuristic, break down into beam, ballistic, and missile. The mechs go from small to large. With the smallest being the fastest with the least armor and arms, while the Big Boys are slow but are walking bunkers.. The maps are, mostly, open so you can engage at range. (though there are some tight maps too).  If you are an FPS player its  an easy transition. You do have to watch your consumeables. You do have UAVs, System Cool Down Shots, Air/Artillary strikes...so it does have a more 'thinking' aspect to it than some of the other FPS games.  You can drop into random matches...or...join ""Faction Play"". Faction Play is currently a work in progress but has already, in my short playing time, gotten much better. You pick a side and either defend or attack to win all the planes in the games universe. You have the 'clan' (human descendents who are invading) or the ""Houses"" (star kingdoms ruled by a family or official who are defending from the clans). You'll need to read onlin and in game...LOT's of info.Now...let's talk about the community.I have met many awesome players and youtube posters who love the game. I've played with a few and had an absolute ball. One of the things (some) players talk about is how great the community is. For the most part it is....but....DO NOT GO INTO THE GENERAL FORUMS...STAYIN THE NEW PLAYER FORUMS!!! >>>> There are a large percentage of 'older' players who are NOT happy with the game. They're called ""Bitter Vets"" and they can be really mean and ugly. Most because of lore...some because they don't like the way it's morphed into more of a mainstream FPS game. but mostly because the tabletop lore is not the same as an online game. (NOTE: there were PC games in the MWO genre from the 80's and 90's and some can't understand why we can't have that kind of gameplay on MWO now...so still Lore ♥♥♥♥♥s but from a different generation of players).  Many of these ""Bitter Vets"" really really want this game to crash and burn  because they are so offended. Many of them have spent thousands of dollars to get every mech and they expect that the game should cater just to their needs. TLDR Rating?4 out of 5I play atleast 15 hours a week...so it does keep my interest. You CAN play this game and spend no money - There are many ways  to earn in game cash for anything you want to own.  "

												Arena combat shooter with stompy robot's that function similar to tanks. This game has a lot of content, and lots of customization. Fan's of classic MechWarrior will feel familiar, and new players have a great tutorial to study.Don't expect 360 no scope headshots, mech's take time and tactics to kill.Despite critisim from some battletech loyalists, the game is on par with most popular F2P titles like WarThunder and WoT. It recently become more balanced and less 'grindy' and you can unlock 95% of the games content for free (playing monthly events also rewards you with free swag).Investing in Hero mech's and premium time is well priced, and worth doing to keep the game alive.

												I have played this game since it was a boxed set for tabletop, saw the whole saga, decrepit inner sphere mechs half-patched together, very few new ones made, and suddenly there is this Merc Unit that has some peculiar weapons, seem to be Darn Good, and then left, bringing back Gen Kerensky alright, But NOT in the fashion they had in their wildest dreams imagined. Aside from the expense of the game (although that fits too since ONLY the Rich had mechs) this is a very well done creation of simulation to a fine degree. If I were not a disabled Vet on SSI I would be buying large numbers of mechs and packs etc... and playing them up to full levels.  Not much one can do once sedentary, yet this is something that helps with the cardio-vascular and mental alertness sides.  I am 54 and been going thru all the different versions of this game, but only heard about THIS a few months ago, and immediately found my old favorite, waiting patiently for me for me to return.Thank You for the Enjoyment!

												This is an awful game.The balance and gameplay changes have consistently taken a turn for the worse, and the equivalent of the star wars NGE experience is about to hit it.Most mechs that you use will be bad, or one particular variant of it will be good. In order to actually use it, you will have to grind out several variants of it that are abominable and make you farming fodder for long-time players (which is everyone still playing)The pricing for the F2P is catered exclusively to a few remaining whales. Unless you want to pay the full price of a regular game for one mech chassis (why would you?) then don't bother.The developers are known scam artists. They have consistently missed deadlines and outright lied about promised features or things they would never do (clan mechs, 3rd person view, etc.)My verdict is do not buy this game. You will be farming fodder for long-time players in a dying game with an intolerable grind, lying developers, and an obscene pricing system. If you love mechwarrior, go install one of the older games instead of playing this.			"

												Do not bother to download or play this game, I truely can not say this strongly enough. I have put over 3 years of my time into this game and alot of money as well. PGI (this games creator) does NOT care about its player base. First let me say I don not like any games that are pay to win, while this game is not intended to be pay to win it has become so. PGI will take your money and laugh that you were foolish enough to do so as they release mech pack after mech pack and steadfastly REFUSE to address ballence issues that have nearly killed this game. If you do decide to play this you will quickly see that purchasing mechpacks that get nerfed after general release  (unless they are Clan mechs) because PGI simply does not play test new mechs for ballence. What you buy at release quickly gets nerfed after pgi understands that it is simply broken  (if Intersphere). Yes new mech packs especally Clans mechs are pay to win. The usuall time these new mechs are nerfed is JUST after or on the day of general release to be purchased with ingame (not real money) C bills. In fact in Competive play 99.9% of the mechs used are clan mechs due to this insane mech/tech imballence. I have been involved in this universe (battletech) for around 28 years and with what they are doing to this game I can only hope that PGI NEVER gets ahold of Star trek or Star Wars License. What they have done to this game should be Criminal. I know that I can not get my money back from PGI at this point so all I can do is warn others to stay away like it is contaminated with the plague. Simply move on and dont bother with this game.			"

												Tried this game out and I have to say:1) good gameplay with good mechanics2) As expected a customziation system that takes into consideration heat management and weight and other stuff.3) Great teamwork rewarding system and a decent in game currency output for your efforts.4) controls while all over the keyboard arent as bad as I thought it would be 5) really makes you think on strategy over games like Hawken, that is fun but more quick paced shooters with classes that are lopsided.But I dont want to play this game anymore because:1) in game currency system makes you pay out the♥♥♥♥♥for super mechs,2) some mech you buy from in game currency are like those super mechs but then you still have your 'God'-tier mechs that are some odd $32 which I get a game from 2012 still needs to make money to run servers and such but take an example from other MMOs cosmetics and some boosters make alot of cash3) for a game that has been out for about 3 years the graphics have alot to be desired. 4) Premium time? what my regular time im putting into this game isn't worth enough to you guys?I know people would say ""oh jsut because premium is there doesnt mean you have to get it."" While obviously true it still means that no matter how much time i put in some other person with more cash is gonna buy a better mech that took me XX amount of days to work for and thats not something that makes me feel like a valued customer or gamer to this community.

												They could have kept closer to BT lore. But they didn't. The gameplay isn't bad however it has no progression, MW:O really is just an arena shooter. It's not an MMO in any sense, but if you like arena shooters give it a crack, I like playing this game with my friends/mates. But the reason I give this game a Negative review, is the lack of progression beyond an arena shooter. Every other Mechwarrior game has had a single player campaign and after three years why don't we have one? More so why didn't the steam launch have one?  "

												I've played the game since founders beta so on and off since 2012. This game hasn't fixed its huge issues for years. Mech combat is poorly balanced, favouring clans, the more expensive faction, since they were released. The grind is rough, the first 25 matches gives you a large bonus so you can buy one IS mech and most of its upgrades. But that is only once and each new mech requires some basic upgrades like double heatsinks, a necessary update at 1.5 million for every mech, endo-steel, and new engines and weapons. After you get one mech you need to master 2 other variants of the same chassis to unlock the skills required to compete with veterans who have been playing for a long time.The queue times are probably the biggest killer, taking 5+ minutes to find a basic match for the game's most common game mode and that's the fastest it gets. Community Warfare queues can take up to 30 minutes.Game modes in this game are all really simplistic with the TDM and team conquest styles because really basic kill-all-enemies is fine but the community warfare mode is completely lacking on any deeper roles or meaning despite it being supposedly the final game mode for faction vs faction warfare. Factions are so empty that everyone jumps around to whatever faction has enough people and there's no meaning to planetary losses or gains.Overall, this game has been developed poorly for years, minimal viable product being an actual term used to describe it by the developers, and this is just an attempt to gain a few more people before the game goes under. The free to play game is usually described as having whales to make money and a large amount of people to fill the game so everyone's happy. MWO is a game that only has whales left and they're desperate for the game to appeal to people who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on this game. "

												I'd like to be able to recommend this game given the hundreds of £ and hours I have spent on it, having played since closed beta. Unfortunately I can't really due to the constant stream of band aid nerfs and no real worthwhile additions to the game (new maps and features are extremely rare), with the focus for the direction of this game purely being on selling over-expensive mech packs (see Downloadable Content For This Game for some prime examples of this)There's always the chance that this will change in the future, but given the modus operandi of the last few years, I doubt it.Fun enough if you just want to stomp around in mechs for a bit and shoot some things without really trying to get into it.

												As a veteran player, this game is a substantial letdown. Gone are the mechanics and thrill of piloting a mech that was present in Mechwarrior 2, Ghost Bear's Legacy, and so forth. The game itself is graphically beautiful and may take a recent graphics card to handle it at a good frame-rate. Sadly, this is the only real good thing going for it.Much of the control system has been entirely removed, opting for an extremely ""streamlined"" method of play. This is to such an extent that one wonders if a keyboard is really necessary anymore. The sheer amount of customisation that was in previous entries is vastly reduced. While the predecessors gave the feel of a simulator, this rendition feels more like an arcade game.Although the publisher claims the game to be free, it is instead paid through numerous, pricey ""microtransactions"". It would be far, far cheaper to just buy a game outright. There is no option for that here (it would be significantly cheaper).As a note to those who have played MechWarrior Online in the past, you will be forced to play through a tutorial before you can return to active multiplayer gaming.If one is completely new to the genre, they may enjoy it. For others, I strongly recommend running the older games or looking for an open-source game that competes with this.Requiescat in pace, FASA. It was a good run while it lasted.			"

												If you are a battletech fan, you might try the game out. But dont spend Money on it as theres no need for it for now. After few weeks , if you still like the game, drop some dimes on it. But until then let the game impress on you. The developer dont have a good track record and are known as to be incompetent.The core  gameplay itself might be pretty fun, but after some times it gets extremly boring. Maps are bad designed- The battles going on mainly on the middle of the battlefield- same old nascaring is a big issue. You aint see much hard content- there are only 3 gamemodes basically since a few years which all play pretty much the same. Community warfare is a very bad designed ""hardcore"" mode which has been abandoned by the community and pgi.Speaking of content, you will notice that you get pretty much spammed with mechs for $ sale. After some owned mechs you ll realise  that most new mechs are a repeat of already existing mechs. Speaking of Mechpacks, if you dont decide to buy them with $ you have to wait up to 6 months to buy them for ingame currency. And in any mechpack there allways  a broken- outperforming mech, which only get fixed  - if even - after a few months while the rest of the non package payers have to suffer facing those new broken mechs( broken in terms of hitb oxes mainly).  Mechpacks and pricing in that game is extremly unreasonable. Mechpacks cost between 80 and 120 dollar, which i find disturbing as you can buy 1- 3 AAA games with it.The veteran/core  fanbase can be very ignorant to criticism. They have a bad habit of defending the game and the develeoper  even if you have a obvious and valid point to critique.Income used to be terrible so it took you up to 1 or more months to colllect the ingame currency for the mech (3 variants of the same mech) and then you have to level all 3 variants up in order to benefit from unlocked modifictions such as speedtweak.)The dev who in charge of the game mechanics and weapon balance has no clue what he is doing and is pretty much disliked by the community. Over nerfs and absurd buffs following each other.I Played the game over a year but then left when  i realized that the devs are really untrustable and incompetetent.Pgi was  previously known as jarhead games. They developed those shady 5 dollar game. http://www.ign.com/companies/jarhead-gamesGlassdoor reviews will proof that the head of pgi is incompetent			"

												Ok, so unlike alot of commentaries here I'm not going to discuss the progression of this game since Closed Beta, through Open Beta to today. Today is what matters, as the game goes to STEAM.  To be up front, I have about 11,500 matches under my belt and hundreds of hours of game play so I'm not new to the game, it's background or it's challenges.Video fx/Graphics (8): The artwork for the Mechs is fantastic imo. Even if you don't necessarily agree with the direction of the Art team or modeling of the Mechs, they still look well done and attractive. Intimidating and lethal, they look much as any fan of the intellectual property of BattleTech might imagine. I deducted points here due to some pixelated terrain that looks like a game from 2003 in places and some odd modeling/animation mistakes. Additionally, some of the mechs need a scaling overhaul, as some smaller tonnage mechs are larger than mechs in heavier weight classes. Overall tho, a great effort and all indications are this will get better. Audio (9): Again, barring some minor aesthitic disagreements, the sound effects are well done and the game sounds good during gameplay. Autocannons have a great bang/crunch mechanic, lasers sound vicious and explosions/getting hit add to the immersion. Immersion (6): This is where the video excellence and audio excellence fall short, in tandem with other things that are decidedly lacking. The musical backdrop is solid usually, but there are no immersive ingame sounds. While you are in the Mechlab/game join screens. If I'm in some giant bay somewhere modifying a 60-ton warmachine, shouldn't there at least be some air-wrenches screaming or the sounds of metal clanging or SOMETHING besides simple music? Missed opportunity there. Additionally, there's no tie to a back story within the game. If you're not already familiar with the IP, most of the game will mean nothing to you nor does the game give you much information in that respect. Backstory (0): PGI makes no effort to tie the grand-lore that sets this IP apart from any other ""walking-tanks"" battlesim and misses out hugely there. Hiring some writers or poaching directly from the novels/game books that are associated with the IP would make sense here, but there's no real history at all. Just some forum links to community based websites (such as sarna.net) that are great efforts, but in no way as reach, or as accurate as actually being source material. With the addition of ""communit warfare"" some of the planets have information about them, but no context really. Ultimately, you know this IP/background already or you're finding it from other sources, as PGI hasn't bothered.Gameplay (7.5): Purely from a gameplay mechanics and fun aspect, I enjoy playing it BUT I've been playing it for years now. The initial stings of playing through the learning curve are long past for me. I can enjoy the new Mechs as they are introduced immediately for their various strengths and weaknesses. This is not the same for new players.New Player Experience (2): I only grudgingly even give it a 2. The tutorial is a great (recent) addition to the game, but the game mechanics are not explained well anywhere, forcing new players to learn through pain or comb through dense forums. The occasional tip at the start of the match isn't enough, and usually have to do with reminding players about key-bindings to use. It has no centralized resource to explain how the Clan, Inner Sphere, Trial, Hero, or Champion mechs work differently, how certain weapons when ""boated"" in larger quantities cause ghost heat, etc to help people understand what the heck they are doing. The cadet bonuses to your first 25 matches are substantial but easily squandered by new players who are completely clueless on what does what. A PDF file attached to the game with all of the tips and key info, or a wesite framework with a similar design would be incredibly helpful to new players. The current website information is largely out of date.Balance (7.5): The weapons have some balance issues that are bound to be improved upon but are not intuitive to the player. The Mechs themselves as the platforms have some glaring optimal performers and some glaringly bad Mechs, with the majority in the comfortable middle. If all Mechs had useful roles, even if those roles were not purely combat related, that would improve their value immensely. Players who live primarily Clan, or Inner Sphere tend to accuse the other side of being ""OP"" based on Clan mechs having significant intrinsic advantages uniformly, while Inner Sphere mechs enjoy very niche, but powerful ""quirks"" to bring them up to par. Overall, balance has improved much over time and continues to balance the main systems to a reasonable degree. Room to improve here, but overall it's solid. Modes/Replayability (2): The game has three quick modes....assault, where teams can kill the enemy team or capture a objective on their opponents' side of the map, conquest where teams can the enemy team or earn points by owning up to 5 slow-ticking objectives scattered between the two teams, and skirmish which is team death match. Community warfare, involving larger maps (but still 12 on 12 matches) with 4 spawns per pilot is the ""meta"" level of the game, where players are fighting over planets. As much as I'd love to say they got this right....it's incredibly tough to enjoy at the moment for a variety of reasons you can read about on the forums. I'm very hopeful that Beta 3 will introduce some options that add more to that mode and help attract more players to it.EndGame/Why play factor (2): Once the fun wears off in playing the same three modes, you're left with grinding new Mech chassis for the sake of collecting them. Without a driving reason to fight and no value to community warfare outside of bragging rights (no politics, impact to resources, impact to your gaming experience for fighting etc), you're literally just playing because you enjoy the shootem up portion or to make your collection larger. F2P factors: There's no penalty to P4F, as the ""hero Mechs"" don't represent a real leg up in any true sense, but it does cut into the grind ALOT to pay for premium time. Grind:  This game does have a grind/leveling component that can be daunting for new players only because again, within the New Player Experience (NPE), they are likely to make mistakes in how they spend their initial funds.  Recently, PGI increased the rate of return on c-bills (ingame currency) that helps mitigate this facet of the grind, and players will learn quickly about the experience/mastery grind which really isn't something you can get around without spending MC ($ for game currency) to expedite.In 2013, I gave this game a 5 on metacritic.My overall opinion of the game would be to give it a 7 currently, but again I'm biased due to my love for the Battletech IP.  If you ""scored"" things with roughly equal weight as I laid them out above, you'd get a lower #. In the end though, the community is small but overall pretty good (ignore the toxic outliers), the game has a certain amount of fun factor that cannot be explained, the game continues to improve albeit at a slow pace AND it's F2P without any real penalty to do so.Well worth the serious stab at it if you're at all interested in tactical shooters, especially ones that are not pure twitch.

												Certainly a thinking person's shooter. With communication, teamwork and stratagy dictating the skill ceiling of pilots. mWo is not for those who expect to play the game for a week and assume completion and own everything in the game. You will need to work hard at mastering the in ingame mechanics; switching views, torso twisting and information processing. The free to play format is perfection, PGI are generious if you put the time in. And even more generious If you use real currency in the game. Solo queue and go it alone expect the longest possible grind to attain your C-bills and Mech's. Join the forums and community, fast track your training and ability and understanding of the universe. Find a unit, join a house, perhaps become a loyalist and reap the rewards offered. This is a game that will keep you on your toe's, last the ages and give you friendships that will last a lifetime.For those interested in making the most out of this game without spending money, each and everyday mechs have a x2 bonus on your first win for the day. So if you win a game on all the trail rotation mechs and play 1-2 community warfare games a day you make plenty of c-bills. There is also Cadet bonuses, faction rewards, tutorials and Achievements. Keep an eye out on your launch client as events that reward premium time and all sorts of goodies are a regular thing!We welcome you steam to our war harden universe, see you on the battlefield warriors.  o7 "

Each time I have come back it has been just as fun as the first time I started playing but when I quit playing it is basically for the same reasons as the last time I quit.Progress does slowly proceed but often there are misteps which have to go back and resolve.

												Riding on the back of battered and neglected franchise was PGI: Offering promises to a desperate fanbase to take them for every penny they could get. MWO is a good example of a F2P game done wrong, absurdly overpriced founders packs paved the way for consistantly overpriced mechs that in some cases cost as much as a entire AAA game followed by even more expensive and gated mech packs that mean that even when a mech will be available for 'free' (by free I mean spending hours and hours and HOURS grinding for) they wont be available for SEVERAL months while the poor smucks that dished out buckets of cash will be using these fancy new but unavailable to you mechs to curbstomp you. (Unless they got one of the bad eggs, then they have a high priced turd you can demolish for free!)Now don't get me wrong, at its core the game is pretty fun, just grindy as hell and having buy buy buy constantly being thrown in your face by a dev team that has consistantly abused its playerbase (in some cases belittling them). Most of the original MWO fanbase either hates the amount of money and time they wasted on this game or they fanatically cling to a dying dream coasting on the sometimes thousands of dollars 'invested'.Do I recommend playing the game? Yes. Do I recommend spending a single penny? Hell, no.			"

												Looking for the honest opinion of a veteran of big stompy robot goodness?  Someone with an intimate understanding of even the smallest game mechanics, and who can give an objective review for all of MWO's features without sugar-coating them?  Well sit back and read on potential mechwarrior.  I, the venerable Carchemish (in-game name) do kinda sorta fit that description.  Mostly.I'll break this down into what MWO is, and what it is not.  First the 'is':-  Mechwarrior Online is a player vs player, team arena style game set in the venerable Battletech universe.-  It is a beautifully rendered game, both in the landscapes and of course the mechs.  PGI has done a fantastic job making the mechs look amazing, especially given the awful source material. Anyone familiar with the old crappy Battletech ""artwork"" knows what I mean.  I really can’t say enough about this.  I’m always blown away by how they continue to make such gorgeous mechs from such bad original art-  It is a great blend of slow, build-up-to-the-fight, and then fast paced action.-  You’ll have a huge mech variety to explore.  Want to race across the map in a fast, agile scout?  Done.  Want to slowly lumber into the battle in a behemoth carrying a blistering array of guns?  Make it happen. -  MWO is well balanced across the two opposing factions, the Inner Sphere and the Clans.  Those familiar with the BT lore will know how insanely strong Clan tech was compared to the Inner Sphere.  PGI has done a very good job of balancing the two sides without entirely neutering the Clans.-  MWO has an appreciable learning curve, and will take some time to fully absorb.  The actual gameplay is essentially point and shoot, but the mech and weapon variety will take a while to get used to.Now for the 'is not':-  MWO has no PVE content (yet).  If you prefer a story-driven game with missions and NPCs and such, this may not be the game for you.-  MWO is not a ‘fast action all the time’ game.  Players will have to scout, find the enemy, set themselves up in the best positions they can, maneuver on the fly, and duke it out with the other team.  Planning and forethought will help you win games. Which brings me to my next point.-  Mechwarrior Online is NOT a single player game.  It is a team effort which rewards players for working with their cohorts.  Running off by yourself (with few exceptions) will likely get you and your team murdered.-  It is by no means a perfect game.  It has bugs, though they are few in number.  The mech balancing isn’t complete, though they continue to work on that.-  It is not “pay to win”.  This one deserves some attention.  Yes, there are some mechs (the so-called “hero” variants) which can only be purchased with real cash, but in most cases they are actually inferior to the standard variants!  So why would you buy them in the first place, you ask?  Hero mechs provide a c-bill (in game currency) boost when playing them, so they’re a good way to earn more money to buy more mechs!  And when I say “inferior”, I mean marginally so in most cases.  Sometimes they are just as good.   And yes you can purchase mech packages with real money, but they offer no advantage over other players who choose to grind out the in-game money!-  It is not World of Tanks!All in all, MWO is a solid game with a lot of playability and huge potential for even more features in the future.  If you enjoy the PvP experience, and are into the mech genre, this one won’t disappoint.  I fully recommend it, so long as you know what you’re getting into.  Last thing…getting a hold of a decent headset/mic and Teamspeak will make your mech life much easier.Hope to see you on the battlefield!  Carchemish the Wise and Powerful			"

												A thinking man's shooter, Mechwarrior Online takes the best part of tank battles and first person shooters and merges them together in Giant mechs ranging from 20-100 tons in weight and dwarfing other types of units on the battlefield.Let me start out by saying that this game does have a steep learning curve.  If you have not played this game before, you will need to go through the Academy first.  That will give you the basic tools to play the game.  After that, you will want to play your Cadet bonus matches in a variety of mechs to get the feel of the different weight classes.  Do NOT buy a mech until you have gotten a good feel for the different weight classes.  Once you have gotten an idea of what you want to play with, go ahead and head to the in game store to buy your first mech with C-bills, the in game currency.  You should have plenty for your first mech after those cadet bonus matches for even an Assault mech.Now that you have bought a mech of your own, you can customize it in the mechlab.  This is going to cost you more C-bills to buy the parts and weapons and upgrades that you want.  You will also find that you have various skills you need to earn experience to unlock and upgrade.After that, if you want to play casually, have fun and enjoy stomping around in your Battlemech.  If you are more competitive, check out the forums on the main game website and see who is recruiting.Overall, I have loved this game, is it perfect? No.  Is it a lot of fun?  You bet it is!  I'll see you out there, Mechwarriors! "

												MWO is very incomplete game, lots of annoying issues such as no fusion reactors exploding (!), no melee, mechs don't interact with terrain well (feet, ankles, climbing, etc), lots of visibility issues (balance by trying to make things dark and hard to snipe -> everyone turns gamma up high), etc, etc. However, it fun game, with lots of stuff to do, mechs to play with and I like it alot even with its failures. Steady 7/10 or 8/10, if you like stompy robots, try it out.			"

												Terrible GUI, doesn't scale for higher resolutions, graphics outdated. Information not available, convoluted. No flavor descriptions at all. Feels like a rush job, but the game is many years old already. Account doesn't provide two-factor login nor can you paste a generated safe password forcing you to choose a inferior simple password.As a new player, not appealing at all and the game pushed me away right from the start.

												Good game. Been playing off and on for last 2 years. Deep battle mechanics means this is not a twitch based FPS like Hawken. You have to think to fight. Map awareness is crucial.  Targeting, then hitting the right component and destroying half the weapons on the enemy mech is more important than just doing general damage. Customizing the mechs is a game in itself. LOL. There are random pub matches 12v12 similar to World of Tanks with different battle modes. Along with Community Warfare fighting for a faction on a global map for star systems.			"

												So here is the deal with MWO.  Its NOT a tabletop game.  Its more of a shooter at this point with a huge selection of chassis and loadouts.  Depending on the chasis and loadout depends on how you play.  Its a huge cooperative/teamwork game.  If you dont play with your teammates you die.  Your team dies and you all look like noobs.  Its very unforgiving in this regard.There is really no endgame at this point and as I am sure you have seen in some of the reviews it was promised to be much much more but it is not there yet.  They have been implementing new content at a higher pace recently and the balance and tweaks have been generally good.  The 3 different gameplays of Skirmish, Conquest, and Assault really do not vary much as it usually just turns into an all out brawl at the end.  Community Warfare is fun but intense and absolutly REQUIRES teamwork as you end up going against coordinated opposing teams that absolutly dominate uncoordinated teams.  However, some of the funnest, heart pounding, got the shakes gameplay has come from CW as it is very...well,,intense.So if you are wanting an RPG style shooter this is not it at the moment.  If you are looking for a good well rounded stompy robot game then this is it.  Literally endless options on how to tweak your mechs and customizations.  Serious fun team play and solo play.  Find yourself a good group of friends to play with or a friendly unit to drop with and you will enjoy this game.  btw I have been playing MWO with theskjaldborg.com (SoR) for 3 years now and we can help point you in the right direction if you want.

												Fired it up, Got disconnected from the tutorial half through and No more tutorial;  couldn't get back into it.  While the  game did  sort of explain the combat controls quickly  It never  really explained  the convulated  upgrade/mech hangar system... which is really and truly an absolute mess.   I spent some  time trying to figure it out and asking  soem questions only  to be entirely rebuffed by the community  basically  the 'How dare you ask us a question Noob' kind of treatment.   Anyways  I had a pretty crappy experience during my few hours here and I wasn't interested in sticking around until some one answered a question.  I played all of 3 games and wasn't impressed.			"

												Great game, with a great community.Has a step learning curve, but after you got the basics it become even betterIch spiele MWO seit August 2012 und uns verbindet eine Art Hassliebe. Mit der Entwicklung geht es wie in jedem Onlinespiel rauf und runter und es wird mal besser, mal schlechter. In der Com kennt man sich doch inzwischen ganz gut und diese ist auch breit aufgestellt.Was wirklich der Plus Punkt schlecht hin ist.  Passionierte Spieler die aus dem Spiel mehr machen, als nur der Arena Shooter der es auf den ersten Blick zu sein scheint.Auch wenn viele auch den Waffenwerten herumhacken (und wir haben viele Waffen hier) gibt am Ende doch der Spieler, die Wahl des Geländes und wie er sich auf sein Team abstimmt den Ausschlag. Manche Gefechte gehen verloren, weil ein Mech irgendwann zu zeitig ausgefallen ist, andere werden gewonnen, weil ein scheinbar verwirrter Marodeur Pilot mitten im offenen Gelände mehr durch Zufall eine ""brauchbar"" Koordinierte Zangenbewegung aufhält. Es sind diese besonderen Momente, die das Spiel wirklich großartig machen können. man geht ohne Chance auf einen Sieg in ein 2 vs 1 Duell gegen 2 Mechs die zusammen doppelt so schwer sind.... und man siegt....oder man führt einen Angriff und auf einmal ist das Team verschwunden...und dann zerbricht man dennoch im Alleingang die Linie des Feindes.

												I have played MWO a lot in the last two years. I find the gameplay is good, the maps are fun, and the variety in the mechs adds a lot of flavor, strategy and planning that needs to be done before a match even starts.Is the game perfect? Definitely not. There is a steep initial learning curve, the matchmaker can sometimes take a while to find a match, and with all the customization it's easy to bring something to the battle that is very sub-optimal. On the flip side, I really enjoy the high skill ceiling, the high level of customization, the intense matches, and that good strategy/tactics pay off in the field.Would I recommend this to anyone? Absolutely. Is everyone going to find something to like about the game? Absolutely not. If the theme or style appeals to you at all, there is a lot of stompy robot goodness to love in the game. If you like shooters, I'd say give it a try and see if it's your thing. I'd still recommend anyone slightly interested give it a try, as the game is great for a free game. I continue to get a lot of enjoyment and entertainment from it.If you try it out and don't like it, then I wish you luck on finding your next game. If you try it out and do like it, you are in for a lot of fun! I'll look forward to dropping with you in the near future. :)Cheers!Malum			"

												This game has so much potential, despite it being made by the same people who brought you duke nukem forever... First ill give the pros and cons of the game, and then ill go into depth explaining why I do not recommend this.Pros:1. gameplay is challenging and stupid players get destroyed quickly.2. Its highly skill oriented3. It requires tactical gameplay, poking your head out is a cause for destruction, and being a rambo is instant death4. It has a lot of customization and variants to suit the needs of the battle5. Puts more of an emphasis on team play than lone wolf play. You get more rewards for doing damage and assisting your team, than you do for getting a kill, typically/Cons:1. Very Long Range Missile (LRM) heavy skirmishes, meaning you wont be able to necessarly see them before they destroy you2. No Prevention of Bad players from participating in CW, leading to faction imbalance, players getting stuck at their spawn to instantly die3. Admins do not adhere to their own code of conduct and enforce the CW (community warfare) code of conduct... which would ban most bad players4. There is no learning curve, only a cliff with a bottomless pit that you will barely be able to crawl out of.Most players are going to suck at this game the moment they enter. You cannot go in thinking you will dominate the entire enemy team. Very few will and chances are you are going to die a lot before you learn.On top of this, there are no requirements to enter community warfare/faction play. This is a mistake, there is a special code of conduct reserved for it. If you suck you are dragging your team down. Their CoC follows the league of legends rules to where if you ♥♥♥♥ up in cw, you will be getting penalized... but the admins do not do their jobs.Players will bring in trial mechs, not have the skills or custom loadouts to get the job done. CW is end game and many players just dont care. You do not queue for CW if you dont know how to play, simply put the devs are just screwing around.In order to unlock skills, for mechs, you have to purchase the mechs, with cbills. Then if you want to go up to the elite/master tier of skills, you need to have 3 variants of the same mech, and max out all normal skills to get to elite, and all elite skills to get to master... on all 3 variants. It takes time to do this, and it really does matter, in the end... so if you dont like to grind, this is not the game for you.I will end this with one statement. Its not fun if you constantly lose because bad players dont care. Its not fun if you are trapped in spawn and cant even fire at the enemy before you are dead. I will not recommend this game until there are requirements to enter CW, and even then it will be an apprehensive reccomendation.It is very clear that pirhana games has no clue what they are doing in their game design, and it is fairly clear they will never know. Once again, this is made by the same morons who made duke nukem forever. This should be a clear indication of the incompitence you will find in the development of this game.			"

												There continues to be a dedicated community around this game. For better or worse, their love of what this game ""could be"" keeps them both playing and being positive about the game as a whole. As far as positives there are some great members of the MWO community, and early on that kept me playing this game. As a founder unfortunately I don't have similiar feelings about the developers but my feelings are less important then the facts.When advertising for the game began several promises were made about the type of game being delievered. Mech warrior online would be a ""....the Mechwarrior you know. It's a fully first-person. It's not a new interpretation.""  ""Players will be able to band together in the format of a lance..... they'll be able to band together as a mercnary coporation for hire.... to customize the look and feel ..... how they enter battle, the lances, their names, ranks, and all kinds of things.""""Anything that would affect or give you a tactical advantage, you can't purchase with real cash."" I could continue quoting unrealized promises and quickly run over the character limit for reviews so I will sumarize.Of the ""four pillars"" of gameplay (mech, role, community, information) at best two are fully realized. You can both purchase mechs/items with real money and some of the meta (most useful in the current game) mechs can not be purchased without a cash purchase.The idea of community warfare and therefore the ability to act as a ""mercenary"" is completely non-existant even though it was heavily talked about. News/lore relevant to actual gameplay (arguably another part of community warfare, but still missing)A single player campaign, PVE, the explicit statement that there would be no 3rd person, coolant flush/shots, priority strikes (improved usuables only available with real money). The devs also had several at best insulting statements to large portions of the community on multiple occasions, claiming that same old ""small vocal minority"". There are multiple instances of employees acting out towards individuals in the mwo community, there are certainly claims on both sides, but several instances of them acting out without just cause, including the entire banning of huge groups of players, then later saying they would unban anyone who asked nicely. Theres no doubt they unjustly banned players to ever make such an offer.On top of this the game has only gotten more punishing for new players with hard to understand hidden mechanics, the worst example being ""ghost heat"".On all of these, simply google them, no need to take my word. Theres more to be found.tl:dr Game with potential and amazing community members ruined by the developer and employees.			"

												This is not the MechWarrior game we are looking for.In its current state, MWO is not going anywhere fast. It is painfully aparent that this Free-to-Play game is supporting itself on very expensive Mechpacks (new mech comes out, preorder commences, nostalgic players drop $80, rinse and repeat). Gameplay is very, very stale. The 'immersive' battlefield known as Faction Play is a barren wasteland that is simply a harder and less-popular clone of Quick Play.Here is what you will find if you play this game.You will get massive ammounts of C-bills (probably around 25-million) for your first 25 games. Then your recruitment bonus will end and funds will trickle in like icicles melting in a warm breeze. It becomes EXTREMELY time consuming and tedious grind for a single million C-bills.Mechs (the ones that are available for C-bills) cost MILLIONS of C-bills to purchase, and you only get 3 free slots for Mechs. So unless you win a Mechbay from an event, you will only be able to own 3 Mechs for free. That is, assuming you manage to earn enough C-bills to buy 3 Mechs.Quick Play (which is currently the ONLY viable game mode) is the same 12 vs. 12 man match over and over and  over and over again. You have different maps and slightly different objectives (if other players vote for them at the voting screen) but it is hardly enough to keep you engaged and interested for the lenghth of time it would take to afford an Assault Mech.Oh, and these 12 vs. 12 matches are PUG matches. Which means you will be trying to coordinate a 12-man team of random players. Use your imagination.All told, game looks great and the mechanics aren't terrible. Sadly it is one of the ever growing number of Free-to-Play titles that are going towards the Pay-to-Enjoy model. And heads up, even if you do pay, it won't make the matches more interesting.			"

												Welcome back to the Mechwarrior Universe, where you can bask in the glory of many different Mechs both Inner Sphere and Clan as they spew death upon one another in the beautifully crafted maps of MWO.The combat is highly tactical, the skill of a mechwarrior is not in their twich reacations but their choice of target and how they engage it, with the build they have entered the arena with. The game encorages players to work together & improve their teamwork and to be tactical with their shots managing their mechs heat levels not only when deployed in combat but when creating the loadouts for their purchased mechs. That large pulse laster puts out a lot of focused damage at good range, great for removing opponents limbs and components, but it also puts out a lot of heat and it is heavy!I have been playing MWO for about 2 years and i can honestly say that i have seen a continuous improvement in the game over that period (it has had some downs as well). There are not a lot of games i am still playing after such a long period which i consider testament to its quality.MWO caters well for casual play if you just want to stomp around in a big robot spraying laser death for an half an hour or so as well as more involved clan matches and alliances in clan warefare.The regular challenge weekends have been fun and provided insentives to get players using new features when they have been added, as well as giving players ""hats"" to adorn their mech cockpits with.edit:Just read a review which slammed the mwo community... clearly the reviewer had never attempted to join it. The PGI forums are very active and a lot of experienced players are willing to advise new ones, the team speak servers are also very active!The reviewer also mentioned that there is no guidance on how to build a loadout for a mech and that its easy to blow your hard earned cbills on something that, well isnt the most effective build. I will go back to the community bit here because the builder tool http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlab lets you design your mech build and test its heat performance before you spend a stone. If you dont know enough to work out a good build on your own there are countless shared builds to choose from linked from the forums.			"

 TLDR:  I cant recommend this game at this time. The developers prioritize money (overpriced mechpacks) over any real content, it's shown through the lack of finished content added to the game in the last two years. If you really want to give it a try, go for it, just set your standards low. It's not a AAA title nor is it even close to finished. In fact there's little this game does well. If you want to know more, please read below, and thank you for your time. LONG VERSION Let the player numbers speak for them selves.  Player Count [steamcharts.com]The monetization of the game is quite possibly one of the worst I've ever seen.  Mechs packs being sold from $30 bucks to an astonishing $220.  That's a  premium price for an unfinished game  that doesn't have a bright future in terms of content.Mechs may be bought with in-game money at an exorbitant price for each one. Then you have to buy weapons, a new engine, modules, for your mech. Let's do some math shall we? Let's pretend you are going full free to play, and want the best mech in the game Kodiak 3k. 16 Million C-bills      150,000 C-bills a match      15 mins for each       You need 16 Mill            16 Mill / 150.000 = 106.6 matchs * 15 mins = 1,600 mins / 60 mins for a hour = 26 straight hours.  26 hours, in a mech you may not like, for a SINGLE MECH and thats not the cost for the weapons. Granted their are cheaper mechs, but chances are they are♥♥♥♥♥♥and you will only have them to level them.Only ""4"" game modes. Skirmish(TDM), Assault (TDM), Domination(TDM), and Conquest.                       1.) Skirmish: Standard TDM                      2.) Assault: TDM with the option to capture the enemy base.                      3.) Domination: TDM with you being forced to fight in the center of the map.                       4.) Conquest: being the worst mode due to the maps not being designed for it and teammates not knowing what do to.   Graphic are just ok, and battle damage looks like something made in MSPaint. PGI cant stop the hackers. Seriously. You wont see many because the player base is low, but again PGI can't stop the ones that do without video proof.A small development team means VERY SLOW small releases if they aren't delayed for months.Global chat is NOT the game. It may be to limit people from knowing how many players are on.The UI for the mech bay is terrible, and that's after they revamped it.The UI for your friends/Unit/and LFG window is just a crappy block window. It doesn't even have ranks for your Unit.Few maps, made even fewer by the vote system. You'll constantly play same 5ish maps over and over because most of the maps are just that badly designed, and no one wants to play on them.Every match in any game mode will boil down to death balling.Cosmetics cost around 5-15 bucks to really make a SINGLE mech look unique.The sounds effects and motions of the mechs dont feel visceral. Giant 25-100 ton mechs walking around don't feel very large. The massive weapons don't sound like the 16inch cannon they are suppose to really feel/sound like. Even the more power weapons feel like their smaller counter parts.Community Warfare is the biggest joke in the game. If your Unit takes a planet from someone else...good job. That's all you get. C-bill reward is higher for each match, but you need 4 fully fleshed mechs to really be on par with the enemy, and if you don't do well you wont get a great reward. Also you will be mostly playing against a 12 man team. Thus making solo dropping pointless unless you want you be fighting a losing battle from the start.The community is torn into two groups those who are burned by the developers who not making the game the promised and those who spent too much money on the game to see it die and watch their money go to waste. Just check the message boards on Steam, Reddit, and don't bother on their main forum. They auto delete/downvote any criticism that isn't praising the game at the same time. Seriously I'll be surprise if you see this review.The small development team has a long history of lies to their player base about what content they are working on.			"

												I've played this games for hundreds of hours before it came to steam and came back to it about a month ago so this is my opinion on the current iteration of this game.Pros:Well thought out mechanics.Skill is based on precision and teamwork in this game.Probably the best community I've seen in a game (youngest person I've met online was 16).Immersive gameplay.Great visual queues for everything that happens whether dealing damage or taking it.Teamwork focused gameplay.Extremely Customizable mechs and mech loadouts.There are no ""bad mechs"" as all have strengths and weaknesses.All weapons are fair and balanced.Beautiful scenery/models/animations.Great F2P system (you earn a ton of money early with the cadet bonus which allows you too basicly buy any mech).Little to no ""trolls"".Cons:Extremely high skill ceiling for new players.Clan wars (Comp.) can be dreadful and not worth your time if you aren't in a good faction/group.If you are new and past your cadet bonus you won't be making much money as you won't be getting many points.If you don't do well then earning c-bills (in game currency) can become a grind instead of a steady income.Game modes aren't different enough from one another.Queuing system needs reworking.Overall this game is its own unique experience as no other game is quite like it. It puts you into a cockpit of a huge 25-100 ton War machine and tells you to go out and destroy the enemy Pilots. The feeling you get when you peel apart enemy mechs and visualing see them being torn to ribbons is a feeling no other game can recapture.I can't recommend this game enough. It's fun, has a great community, and as of July the dev team has worked out some of the previous hinderances and problems that this game had (that plagued it long ago but no more!). Now is the best time to play this game so Pilots power up your mechs and head out to war!!9/10 please just try it you are missing out :)(Ps message me if you have questions I am happy to answer anything MWO related!)

												Played it long enough to get an impression.I cannot recomend this game.The maps are small and repeative.There are only 3 game modes that usually end in just kill everybody.The matchmaker rountinly puts you in match's that are not winnable <ie you have 2 lances of lights and they have 2 lances of assaults>.The community is quite frankly toxic over coms.They want 50-60$ for some mech's when they cannot even get their terrain geometry and hitbox's correct.If you want to enjoy this game be prepared to spend either a lot of time grinding, or a lot of money buying the new FOTM, "

												I have been playing MWO for over 3 years and really enjoy it. I'm very much a casual player and find the battle length about right. I'm busy with work so it allows me to drop a couple times without getting too invested. The game has a relatively high learning curve and for new players I would suggest going slow and learning your mech before joining faction warfare.			"

												I have played this game since closed beta, and a Legendary Founder for the game. I have seen this game change very much since those days. Ever since IGP went bankrupt and the license has been under PGI control, they have done a lot to make the game so much more. From Faction Warfare, to a robust tutorial system, to a future PVE campaign. This game is not Call of Duty, this is not Rambo rampage, this is MechWarrior. The combat is slower paced, and team oriented. Running around solo, trying to be superman will get you killed. Stick with your team, focus fire, provide cover fire and try to move from cover to cover. Don't be scared by the price of mechs and mech packs, every single mech (except for hero mechs) can be earned for free by simply playing the game and grinding cbills. There is no 'Pay to Win' mech, buying mechs with cash does not give you a mech thats superior to a standard mech bought with cbills. The only difference between a standard mechs, champion and Hero mechs is that champion mechs earn 30% mroe xp (that stacks with premium time), and Hero mechs {designated by parenthesis like (F), (L), (I), (S), etc} earn 30% more cbills (which stacks with premium time). But you can get standard versions of the same mechs without the bonuses. Not to mention that almost every month PGI has an event where you can usually earn free cbills, MC, mech bays and sometimes even mechs for free. And you can earn free mech bays for doing faction warfare. [Warning if you are a brand new player, I do not recommend doing faction warfare until you have 4 full mechs that are decently skilled)This game will give back to you what you put back into, whether its just a couple quick drops for after hard day, or you are binge-playing over the weekend to get event rewards, The more you play, the better your understanding of the maps and mechs will do you will. Torso twisting, focus firing, cover from LRM swarms, This game will take time to get good at, and putting skills into mechs will make your mechs play better, which will in turn make you play better.Dont be afraid to ask for help, the community thats been here for over 3 years has no problem helping out new players, but for more indepth answers to your questions, go to the MWO forums. There is only so much people can answer in the games chat.			"

												You'll do well to notice that the majority of bad reviews coming from entitled whiners with a chip on their shoulder come from people who started to play the game 3 years ago, continue to play it 3 years later with hundreds of hours on their account and now steam has dropped they're still racking up the hours.Just bear that in mind when you see someone whinging about how the game is bad cos it didn't happen how they wanted it to in 2013 but they're stillp laying it now.The learning curve can be tricky as can finding the right mech for your playstyle but that's the fun, as well as perfecting your build in the mechlab and working towards other features to improve your mechs.communication is key, the community is a lovely one and very welcoming to newbies.Just ignore the absolute benders you encounter who will ♥♥♥♥♥ that now n00bs should be allowed into community warfare, pgi lied and are the meanest parents in the world and uhhh why we have no people playing crowdEvery game has their special case morons and MWO's are a magical breed all their own, good fun to point and laugh at them though.it's by no means perfect, community features and systems for squadplay are severly lacking but progress is always made and the patches come every two weeks			"

												Technically, this is free to play. Yeah, well, technically. In reality, if you want  to compete you'll be plunking down cash for one of the two in-game currencies you can only buy with cash. Works like this: To max out your pilot's abilities on a chassis, you need to level-up four different variants of that chassis, so you need to buy four different variants of that chassis. To compete in something other than skirmish play (random pubbies) you need to have leveled up four different chassis. So four variants times four chassies equals sixteen different variants. Problem: you only start out with space for four chassis. So if you want to avoid paying cash for more you'll be selling chassies for underwear-streaking losses to fit the next one. While you could *technically* do this, it's a giant waste of your resources, which means it's a giant waste of your time. And the very best variants of every chassis are only available if you pay IRL money. So, yeah, enjoy losing to whales who can drop $600 on in-game purchases. Free to play my♥♥♥♥♥ It's free to play until you hit the soft paywall and you're left feeling like your time's been wasted.			"

												Great game with a few caveats. First off, make sure you are in a unit. The solo play is great for awhile but due to the learning curve of the game you are going to have a tough time without someone, or group of someones, holding your hand for a bit. Second, the map selection is a bit weak, but I can't really tell if that is due to the amount of time I have been playing or if they all really are that repetative. (They are improving and building new maps though)All in all its a great team game with a really good community. Anything high teir and comp level you will have a pretty strict meta to follow, but low teir to mid there is a ton of customization and build experiment that keeps it fresh.Definitely the longest I have played a F2P title. Lots of good communication from the dev team.Learning curve is a cliff not a hill. Get in a group.			"

												I love Battletech, and MechWarrior games. That is the only reason I am playing this one. This is the only game of which I am aware that has had so many news stories about how out of touch developers are with their own fan base. They are out of touch with their own playerbase, as well. They are in Forbes magazine for having one of the dumbest business strategies in the gaming industry. Bottum line is that if you like Battletech/MechWarrior then you will like playing this. Thats how I feel. But if you aren't already a fan, you will not deal with the masochism of MWO. It is riddled with poor game play, bugs that have not been fixed after years of beta, game modes that are not compitently tested, and developers who so obviously don't know how to play their own product. It is mind boggling and entertainment in of itself how frequently they want to change random massive gameplay features/foundation of rules that make the game worse every month. But I foolishly play it. Because I love battletech.Russ Bullock is the owner of the license for this game. He is so bad at his job that it has become a comical event among the community to hear how incompitant he is in Town Hall podcasts at No Guts No Galexy. No joke, members of the community (from a panel that he cherry picked, no less) will literally straight up tell him how to improve his game in a consensus, and he will deflect by monopolize/demogague/mic hoging for 3/4+ of the interview time while everyone is struggling to find words to inform him that the community does not like the things that he wants to implement.I have not seen a monthly patch come out that was a positive improvement! I'm not exajurating. (Aside from adding mechs into the game, which is always cool if you can get over that they will charge up to $70 for one mech model each time). The game is buggy. New bugs get introduced at a rate of at least 2:1 every patch. It does not improve. The game changes will alter the entire base of the game (such as radically altering the foundation of heat consumption for all weapons, or quirking 50 mech chasis at a time to completely alter the meta -- as opposed to doing one thing at a time and seeing how it pans out).Its a painful time to be a MechWarrior fan. And I can't wait until Russ looses the license so that good games can be developed for this system by someone that doesn't seem to actively hate his own target audience.			"

												Mechwarrior... a truly oldschool and intrigueing franchise.Sadly the grind, the awardworthy horrible menus, terrible latency and unfriendlyness towards groups of players is too much of a let down in order for the main game to be enjoyable.Tried playing with friends.The matchmaker puts about 30 people together. 27 Europeans and then it takes them to a US-Server.Ping 100-200ms.Great.Cant play quickplay as a group. Dont know why.Gotta join the factionwars, resulting in a team of randoms versus a highly coordinated enemy team that entirely consists of 1 clan.When all our mechs were used, we were forced to watch 20 minutes of the enemy killing 6 afk players on our team.If you leave earlier, you get no reward for the match.Great.Fighthing versus clans that have fully upgraded, customized mechs versus a few newcomers in their trialsmechs.... highly enjoyable./sarcasmWas shooting a congaline of enemy mechs marching into our base.Kept shooting into their backs as they did not even turn around to pay attention to me.Did I kill atleast one of them? No.Great.The reward for the match?200.000Some stock-mechs costs up to 10million +Guess I will have to get destroyed by clans a lot more often until I get a deck of decent mechs.Great.The menu... Buying and setting up your mechs is just one hell of a unintuitive mess.They put up with these vast, annoying tutorials just to teach you how to move with WASD,but they cant ♥♥♥♥ing explain their complicated piece of crap main menu.Edit:We found a way to play Quickplay as a group after I already uninstalled it.Turns out it only takes 4 people and two days in order to find the button for Quickplay in this menu design.

												Don't let my game time fool you. More than enough time was logged before this ported over to Steam for help.I only recommend this becuase it's the only decent ""Mechwarrior-like"" game I can play on my machine without a ton of extracirricular crap. It's free. Yeah. You can buy a lot of stuff which completely unbalances the game... and for a redonkulous amount of money at that.For someone who grew up playing the board games, and the archaic mechwarrior on windows 95/SNES, and upward, this is the only thing I've found to make me feel at home. .. ish. Though you do get a significant boost as a rookie starting off, that dies quickly, and so will your want to play this game if you are not wanting to looking at thousand upon thousands of hours of game time, still only to not make you feel like you've accomplished much of anything. Much like most MMO's. Except this one is lacking a lot that would make it perfect, and its not mechanics.Edit: Apparently my review Butthurt someone enough to make a level 0 private account just to comment and troll reviews. Lol Gotta love the kids on Steam.What I'm referring to about ""Unbalancing"" is that P2W kills Casual playing. Yes, money flow keeps games like this alive. However, there is a line. To get certain Mech builds, you MUST spend Money. They are not all readily available via c-bills.Personally, I don't like paying past the one time purchase fee when I buy a game. But.. It's free O_O so. Making one or two in game purchases(if you see fit) won't be a bad thing. Yes the game has bugs. Name one that doesn't. Wall hackers, rubberbanders, etc etc etc. Welcome to Online Gameplay.If you do want to spend money, i would suggest at, or at least Half the MSRP of a Brand New game. If you buy anything 30$ or under, buy the Steam LIGHT Mechpack. You get two variants that have a perm +30% to cbills, and 30 days premium time which is a flat 50% increase to xp and xbills across all variants. Plus, it's a good idea to master Light Mech fighting. Because for me, it's actually the hardest weight class. Easy for you? Bam. Money.If you buy MC for Mechs, don't spend them on anything else except premium time. As PT = $$$ and you need that to buy variants to unlock the Elite Skill Tree and Mech Modules. Everything else is really obtainable with Cbills.. except Mech Bays. They have random events where you can unlock them. Or you can purchase them in game.AVOID QUICKPLAY. If you are serious about Team Play Join a faction as a merc or a loyalist. Get a team so you can coordinate. If you don't team play, You will get slaughtered.Don't have a Mic/Headset? Don't wanna blow 30-40$ on a Headset? Teamspeak is VERY cheap on the Google Play and Apple App Stores. You can use your phone's headset(which have noise cancel on most) and/or bluetooth and set it to voice activate after a certain range level is met.7/10MWO lost 3 Points because they won't have a Steam Workshop and allow us to customize and design, which would bring in SO Much money for PGI, and they wont allow transferring of cbills between players, so Units can help each other :(			"

There's also no stupid ""You have to spend in-game money to repair your vehicle after the match"" feature. Everything is repaired for free after a match.			"

												If you like arena shooters, but wish there was some more thinking and strategy involved, this is a game for you. The goal is the destroy the enemy, but whether or not you're successful depends not just on your accuracy with a mouse, but how well you can build your mech, and how well you can manage your systems mid-battle.There are a variety of mechs and weapons to choose from, and you can endlessly customize them with numerous paint schemes and colors. Decals are coming soon. You can choose from several factions, each on either side of a galactic war. There's a built-in VOIP, but many people have their own team speak servers. I would recommend getting on one or the other because team coordination is the most powerful tool in this game.Wait on trying the Community Warfare (Faction tab) until you're experienced and own your own customized mechs. It is absolutely a Hardcore mode, and you don't want to try it with the free trial mechs. Don't worry, you can buy everything you need with in-game currency. There is no P2W here, and the 1-2% of items locked behind a paywall do not confer any advantages, they are just unique items. I have been playing since before Steam, and I'd recommend this to any Steam players that want to think when they shoot and engage with a more mature community.			"

												I wish I could write a good review for this game. Sadly I am unable to do this. The reason for this is the fact that I am unable to make a working account for it.When I first tried to make an account, everything seemed to go as planned. The problems started when I had to verify my account using the account verification email that was sent to me. It simply never arrived. Not in my inbox or my junk folder.Figuring something mught have gone wrong with my account, I tried to create a new one. Only to get the message that my email already had an account. When I tried to reset my password, the game said that my email was unknown to the game. While trying to login resulted in the message I hadn't verified my email yet.I contacted support to see if they could help me. After a few days I got a reply saying my email didn't have a pilot name connected to it. The guys from the support said the might help me if I gave them my pilot name, which I gave.Right now I am still waiting for a response from support to see if they can do something with my pilot name.After two days I tried to see if maybe something had changed eventhough I heard nothing. As a surprise the game said it would sent me a link to reset my password. So somehow my email is now known to the game. Yet I still am waiting for that email to reset my password...Eventhough this game is free to play it shouldn't be this hard to get to play the game. While I liked the trailer and was enthusiastic about a MechWarrior Online game I have deleted this game from my computer because of the problems trying to get a working account and the lousy support.

												I must say I'm quite baffled by the amount of negative reviews - the gameplay is solid with a high skill ceiling and opportunities to improve through practice and there is an incredible amount of content up for grabs without spending a dime, although admittedly the expensive mechs do take some grinding to save up and buy this is to be expected in a free to play game.

												Great Game so far. I've been a fan of Battletech and Mech Warrior for years and this game is a pretty decent adaption. Hopefully they continue to develop the community warfare aspect.			"

												BLUF:  Great game, free to play.  If you looking for big stompy robots, this is for you.Been playing for since open beta and the game has come far.  it has a wide assortment of mechs available that can be customized through the mech lab.  Its your mech, make it fit your style.  The maps are stunning, though more variety is needed.  The gameplay is exciting and fast passed, but still feels like you are driving big honking robots.  The game is a bit grindy, but everything is unlockable with effort.  The only paywall exists in very specific champion and hero mechs, which provide a 'c-bill' bonus and more varied options.  However, these are just nice to haves and are in no means 'pay to win'.  Skill is what dominates, but to get there you will have to deal with a rather steap learning curve - these mechs after all, they don't move like your normal shooter.   "

												OK, So why didnt i know about this game sooner? Im loving it as a long time mechwarrior fan. Most of my childhood went to MW2 and MW3, then i found MW4: Mercenaries and my teenage years were spent too. On the plus side after 3 matches in this game the rust has already been knocked off and all that time spent farming Solaris VII matches in multi player and single player paid off. In a light mech i can pretty much guarantee 2 or 3 kills a match. I feel like a seel clubber a bit lol. IN A LIGHT MECH! Honestly i find this game very loyal to the lore and universe, being a veteran from both the pc games and the tabletop. The gameplay is accurate and feels alot like MW4, loads of customization. If your a veteran of the series you'll slot right in and find the learning curve pretty easy, alot of players have sited the game as having a very serious learning curve, im not having that trouble. Fits like a comfy old slipper.10/10 would club newb mechwarriors again!			"

Posted: December 16, 2015
												Been playing this game on-and-off since the early days of its development, so my actual playtime is well above 1000 hours. As both a battletech fan and quite active gamer with only a minor interest in competitive gaming my experience  with the game has been very fun.I recommend the game to anyone who likes battle simulations and/or battletech. If you are searching for a shooter you might take a look but this game is not a shooter. For the battletech fans: Careful, the game does not strictly follow lore. The mechs are all taken from the battletech universe (including some of the Unseen now!) and it follows table top rules in most of the core aspects. In order to balance the game however additional rules and changes have been made in order for Clan and IS mechs to be able to play side by side.Graphics: The game is based on the cry engine so the graphics are solid but not over the top. If you are looking to test out your newest gaming gear and want to see insanely realistic effects you will be disappointed. For everyone else both graphics and design are quite appealing and older parts of the game get reworked from time to time.Gameplay: This part is obviously somewhat subjective. You can probably compare the gameplay to games like World of Tanks. As stated in the beginning the game is more of a simulation than a shooter. This doesnt mean that it is devoid of action. But it requires less twitch reflexes and more patience. There are private, public and community warfare matches. Private and public matches can be played in three different game modes all of which can be won by shooting down all enemies. Public matches are always 12v12 players and last between 5 and 15 minutes, no respawn. Community Warfare matches also are played as 12v12 but allow you to drop several mechs (meaning you 'respawn' up to 3 times) and can last up to 30 minutes. At higher skill/experience tiers there is a strong metagaming aspect which however is softened by the non-competitive atmosphere of the public matches.Apart from the actual matches you can spend a lot of time changing your mech equipment in the mechlab. The game gives you a loot of room for customization and trying out your own playstyle.Community: The current community (pre Steam release) is quite mature and usually rather helpful and friendly. Newcomer questions are usually answered in detail on the official forums. Both official forums and reddit see their regular whining about whatever bugs the players and are subject to a lot of drama. These aspects however do not carry over to the ingame atmosphere or gameplay. I do recommend trying to find a unit (clan) for players who decide to stick with the game.Development: While being a full sized game and by no means half-finished the game is still being developed. Additional gamemodes, customization features and AI opponents have been teased and might be seen within the next year. There also is at least one (mostly two) patch per month for bugfixes, new mech releases, map changes or balance changes.Grind Factor: Getting new mechs and equipment requires a certain grind on your part. The game provides a set of trial mechs which you can play without buying them but those trial mechs do not change very often and are fixed in their equipment. People who play very casual might find this annoying and will not have the opportunity to afford new mechs very often. Compared with other free2play titles however the grind factor is not very high and people who play often should not encounter difficulties.Pay2Win?: The game is not pay2win. Real money can be spend to reduce the grind, buy new mechs and cosmetic stuff. New mechs are released earlier for people who preorder with real money and are sometimes considered really strong for the first week or two. Game breaking balance issues however are usually taken care of such that there is no actual need to preorder anything. All other content releases (maps, game modes) are free.E-Sport/Competitive Gaming: So far the game does not have any ranked matches. Competitive gaming is self-organized in private lobbies. The game relies on both teamwork and individual skill so there certainly is some basis for competitive gaming here. Just recently a tournament was announced by the developer but whether this will ever turn into an E-Sport game remains to be seen. "

												Great game! Play the Tutorials, start slow and learn the mechanics and you will do fine.  Jump into Faction Play without  time under your belt learning how the game plays and how to use your mechs and you will die, die, and die some more.  If you want to be Rambo and kill everything alone this is not the game for you. Team work = Win. Good luck and DIe well. <o			"

												Just found this game at Steam release.. banked over 24 hours play time already and have loved every second.  Amazingly fair for a F2P game there are a few mechs you can only buy with real money but they are more or less just flair and in no way are better then any other mech.I have to say the thing that puts this game over the top is the players. Everyone (for the most part) is extremly nice and willing to help with game info and all you have to do is ask.Like I said before I only started playing at Steam release so I don't know a whole lot about the game but I do know that it's free and alot of fun.12v12 giant robot battles.if that at all sounds interesting to you then give it a try! 10/10 would destroy robots with lasers, bullets, and missiles again :) "

												The short of it: A free to play first person Robotic deathmatch game. Fun to play, though it requires some thinking and is not your typical run and gun game. They make their money off of in game purchases, which is true about most FTP games. If you decide not to purchase anything, it is still possible to be competitive in game through lots, and lots, and lots, and lots.... of grinding. Still a very fun game generally, with a great community.The long of it:I've been playing this game since beta (As well as a long time Mechwarrior game fan) and it has had it's ups and downs. With the newest patch, the game has come to the highest I have ever seen it. It is fun, customizing is a blast, and the matches are amazing. Further development of different game modes and so forth has been great, and I look forward to seeing it grow.If you are a Mechwarrior fan, or even dabbled in it a little bit and enjoyed it, get this game. Give it a try. It is great and there is nothing to lose.If you are new to the series, come on in, join up, blow up some robots with us! Nothing like the smell of scrap metal in the morning! It is an FPS, but it is so far removed from the likes of COD and Battlefield it won't feel stale and old. And there are many players in the community willing to give you a helping hand.			"

												Veteran pilot here, back from closed beta days until now.  My review of Mechwarrior Online is not going to be any polarized PGI aft kissing or hyperbolic salt dripping.  No, I'm going to be honest and as neutral as I can be.  I'm not going to overly delve into the history of the game.  I'll simply state what my thoughts on the game are.Mechwarrior Online offers some of the best arena shooting Mechwarrior combat that I have experienced.  The actual combat is good.  The map variety is solid.  Balance is... acceptable, and certainly more even between Clan and IS tech trees than its predecesors.  The attention to detail in the art department, the visual customization based on loadouts, is heads and tails above all others, with the possible exception of MWLL.  The degree of customization is positively immense!However, not everything is perfect, either.  Development is slow, rocky, and far too often follows illogical decision making.  There is a lack of transparency from the developers, and they do have a nasty habit of ignoring the experienced community's input.  The current, as of this writing, game modes are just variations of team deathmatch and absolutely need expansion in their mechanics as it can get stale playing the same thing over and over again.  Community Warfare matches, while soon(tm) due to have a significant update, currently is of questionable enjoyment and of zero consequence to the overall big picture.Yet it is a game I keep coming back to. Why?  Because the game is still loads of fun.  The core experience is just plain enjoyable (teams permitting), and I can play the game, get my top tier mech experience, eventually get burnt out or tired of the issues that still haunt the game, set it down, and return to it with fresh eyes a couple months later.  That PGI managed to avoid a P2W situation is a fantastic perk that should not be undervalued - nothing you can buy with money is any more competitive than anything you can (eventually) get out of playing the game.  It is pay for convenience, though without the grind can be a little excessive.  Also, while I often disagree with the developers' methods, they work hard.  Not necessarily working smart, but they do work hard at their product.Would I recommend the game?  Absolutely.  Would I recommend spending money on it?  Well... YMMV, and that's just something you'll need to decide on your own.Never a knight of black nor white, shades of gray is where reality lay,Pariah DevalisClan Nova Cat			"

												Been playing this game for years, now it is out on steam! Huge community, very active. Devs are greedy money ♥♥♥♥♥s, but that means new mechs to buy on a constant (every month or two) basis. This game can be pay-to-easymode but not pay to win. Constant updates, more maps, more modes, everything is getting slowly improved but it feels only 80% done right now. I highly recommend if you like giant stompy robots. Gameplay consists of you buying your mech chassis, outfitting it with the engine, weapons, ammo, heatsinks, armor, etc. You then que up for a match and wait to be paired with 24 people (12v12) in your skill catagory. You all vote on the map and mode (Skirmish, assault, conquest etc). Then you play as a team to smash your opponents in stategic and skill-based combat. There are ""skills"" to unlock as you gain XP in your played mech. This makes your mech a bit faster, more agile, etc. There are various (3-8) variant of each mech chassis, 3 need to be purchased and leveled up individually if you want maximum skill level, because there's a bonus if you max level 3 variants of 1 chassis.Some mech variants can only be bought with MC (Mechwarrior Credits) which you only get through events or buying with money. It is very fun to buy your favorite chassis and variants, then outfit them with just the loadout you like, then either brawl (close combat fighting) or long-range snipe. Missiles, lasers, guns, flamethrowers, PPCs, it's all there to play with! Try it out, but give it 5-10 hours to fully appreciate the fun this game offers!			"

												I have been playing MWO off and on for about 3 years now. I highly reccommend it if you favor strategy and team play over a lone wolf, arcade style shooter. As far as Battletech fans from the table-top or past MechWarrior games, this is probably not for you, but as it is free-to-play, I would at least give it a try. It is a solid game with TONS of customization and it still feels great getting into those mechs and bringing the pain. It's very possible to have fun playing the game solo but the most fun I've ever had playing this game has been joining up with a full drop team and communicating strategy and tactics during tournaments and scheduled team vs team skirmishes.One thing I will say about the game as a negative, it has a rather large learning curve. The new in-game tutorial is great and a significant improvement for welcoming new players, but I would still definitely recommend trying to join a MWO clan or group that is willing to teach you the game or at least give you some tips. At the very least maybe watch a tutorial video guide about weapon systems and loadouts. As an example, overall, the premade load-outs for the mechs you use are decent but definitely not the most optimal. Learning which weapons, engines, armor, etc, work best in your mech of choice and which role you should be playing on the battlefield with that loadout, is imperative to your (and your team's) success and overall enjoyment in the game.

												Game is fun for a few hours, then you try faction play.  12 mechs rush your spawn point and kill you, and you have 0 retaliation.  0 options.  The developer shrugs its shoulders, realizes they can't code worth♥♥♥♥♥♥ and just have to accept it as a ""valid tactic"".  Then you have the Horrible UI, where you can't do anything once you try to find a game.  Screen goes black and locks up.  Can't look at your mechs, can't change other mechs.  You try to group up with friends to play, then you realize that each matchmaking system forces a different type of group.  So if you wanted to change to faction play, you have to kick everyone out and reform, only to wait 10 mins for someone to show up to fight against you.  If you have impatience friends, you then have to remove them from your group and reform yet again.The game is fun for the first 100-200 hours.  The in game ui and gameplay, for the most part, is spot on.  The out of game UI looks like it was designed and implemented by a 1st year CS major.TBH, this game is a cash grab for those nostalgic battletech/mechwarrior players.  Every 2ish weeks, they release another 'mech' pack, which is anywhere from $20-50 that hardcore fans just eat up like a kid on halloween.  For those that do this and read this, i'd be cautious.  There is no gaurantee that PGI's license will be renewed once it expires, which I belive could be as early as 2017 or late as 2020, depending on if they reach certain milestones.All in all, i cannot recommnd this game, which i have played more than 1000 hours in since the closed beta.  It was once good, then bad decisions have undermined what could have been amazing.  It still has potential, but with the current developers, I have no faith of that being realized.			"

												I am one of early beta players. Founder. And even if I have enjoyed this game, I can't recommend it to anyone.- Game constantly crashes. Let's say 1 in 4 matches will crash to desktop. It happens to everyone and it is not fixed as long as I have played this game. Most of the players don't return and with that handicap, your team is usually steamrolled.  Even if you return, there is a HIGH CHANCE that enemy light mech will be taking a free kill while you are loading a level. If you don't come back you will be penalized. This bug is not fixed for several years and there is no indication that it will ever be fixed. - Matchmaking is really terrible. 80% of the games finish in 12 kills for one side and maybe 3 for the others side. So, no matter how good you are, it all comes down to team and players. And believe me, there is a BUNCH of terrible players in game. But it's not their fault, game is hard to learn. It's not fun at all to play with this unbalanced matchmaking system. I have uninstalled this game after 10 lost games in a row. Took few hours to play after work and got additionaly frustrated after playing this. Highest damage and most kills in most terrible teams. This is frustrating, something that sucks all fun out of this game. - It is pointless to play this game with your friends, unless you are all equaly skilled and really good in this game, because you will be placed in a matchmaking where player tier plays no role. You will play against pros and will be killed as fast as you can say meta mech. This means that you can either find some awesome no-lifer guild and become a no-lifer yourself or you can play alone, for a slight chance of winning. There you have it. These 3 things completely ruin the game that has so much potential, but somehow owners don't seem to care as long as they get money from new mechs.			"

												Read on, I've got the goods on this one: Ignore the time Steam says I have invested. My forum profile tells me I have over 6000 regular matches and I know I have a couple thousand at least before they put that counter in. I'm pretty sure that doesn't even include my community warfare drops either. I presently own 254 mechs (all mastered but the newest 4) and I had never heard of Battletech or MechWarrior before trying this game. I still don't know jack about the lore, I make my own stories up thank ya very much. Only thing you need to learn is how to point and shoot while running for your life.The good: This game is completely 100% free to play. No BS money sinks, you don't have to put in one single cent to play or be amongst the elite. The weekend (or weeklong) challenges will give you all the MC or mechbays you will need to keep growing your army (community warfare alone allows you to unlock a bunch of mechbays just for playing). Real money buys paint, cockpit items, warhorns and hero mechs (which are not as good as regular variants in nearly 100% of chassis). Even my $500 Gold Direwolf is only a fancy paint job; it's the same Direwolf Prime you can buy yourself with in-game currency. You can make an argument that premium time is essential - I am never without it or my glass of wine - as it cuts down on the grind a lot. I have never not had premium time up so I can't speak to the wasted sober hours some go through.Game play is addicting and can swing between exhilarating and infuriating because all your pug team mates are idiots, right? What you will eventually do is join a community. Then you will find out those guys are annoying and lose every second match and you will move on and find another one. They will be a little better but you'll still be bouncing around like Tigger at a swingers club until you find that sweet spot where those guys who know how to carry a team play. If you're lucky you will pick up a trick or two. I won't tell you who the elite groups are but you'll figure that out. The bad: Bad is a strong word. Work-in-progress is more apt. Community warfare is leaving beta 2 and beta 3 is right around the corner and this game is by no means finished as it is constantly evolving with an ever-changing meta but this is not an early access game. At least you'll be learning about the new features and game modes at the same time as all the vets and won't be at too much of a disadvantage there. Some of the maps are weak and we still need more. In my opinion map making is PGI's greatest weakness but a couple of them are great so that saved their goat. What on earth possessed them to make so many maps that require night vision and heat vision for targeting when you are trying to sell paint jobs to make all your mechs look cool is beyond me. My $500 (HUNDRED!!) Direwolf is Gold and you dummies can't see it cuz you are in heat vision. Look at me dammit, Im gold!!  You can now vote for maps and game modes so the terra-bad (pun!) ones hardly ever come up. I would be remiss without a little word about the griefers. Oh-my-god-some-kids-won't-take-it-like-a-man saga is alive and well. So many people can't handle FPS games and being shot in a pretend world. It's amazing how fragile they are. You will see people have complete public meltdowns. I find alcohol helps, maybe you like pills, I don't judge. Want my advice? Ignore the forums too. It's just a whine and rant-fest. Get TeamSpeak and join a team and ask your questions there. The community is huge. The PGI hate-train is always up and running but I have no issues with MechWarrior at all and I have given them well over a thousand bucks for paint and warhorns. And even though I have given them a ridiculous amount of money they have no issues telling me to go pound sand when I send in my own little rant. Money can't buy you love here, just paint. Lots of paint. Gotta wrap this up cuz the wife is wearing something hot. No-time-to-spell/grammar-check-this-hot, you feel me?. This game rocks. You will go on epic winning and losing streaks, theory craft until your 6am morning alarm goes off, and find a nemesis who you will go to the ends of the earth to kill (I'm looking at you H8Wine). It's run by a North American company so any money you spend here isn't going to some dodgy 3rd world country like some if it's competitors. Go find your fortune, I'll be waiting for you with guns loaded. And kill that H8Wine guy and tell him I sent you.Wine O "

												Perhaps one of the best ways you can go feed your nostalgia in the way of some old school shooting. As your pure mechanized machine goes to pound off the armor of another, whether it's by guns, lasers, or missiles. Unfortunately, despite it's release, it still can feel rather beta. If you carry knowledge of the game, they are trying to stay very close to the story of what Mechwarrior is. Here are some of the things are making this go so wrong.- The Inner sphere take on equal amounts of clanners, where as the clanners. still have their unmatched firepower.- They are desperately keeping clan weaponry to the clan. The Inner Sphere will most likely never see their integration into their systems. - There is an uneeded, visible, TIER system in the game to make you struggle and hate your skills to get to the top.- The maps that they carry are only about small/medium at most in comparison to what size older maps could have been, though this is reasonably required for a 15 minute match. - (Personal) Weapon customization is limited on mechs (But there are many ""Types"" to choose from), So.. take my opinion with a grain of sugar. :PI'm not about to go about this without a bit of things that I like...- Playing something such as a catapult is now pleasing, locking with missiles doesn't require you to literally hold line of sight on an enemy. - Clan have some very interesting way's to adapt. They can switch around ligaments, if you own other types. - Their updates always come with interesting promise. They often do their updates/events with public opinion. A petition was even able to get the urban mech into the game. <3- Buying a Premium mech holds the user no advantage. All mechs and their abilities come from the way you design your mech.  The pilot makes the mech, not the other way around.Despite what's going on, I still hold a lot for this game. Even if there may or may not be a lot of mechs to ever come see the fields, what you have to choose from at this time is still. It definitely scratches some nostalgia for me, it is a very pretty, and pretty much bugless.			"

												Played the game off and on for 3+ years. The game is fun and there's constant updates, as with a lot of MMOs though, you won't get the full experience or have nearly as much fun unless you find a unit and play with other people. The prices are still pretty stupidly high, but as you dont need to purchase mechs to play the game and can get what you need just from playing for free.It's a more tactical shooter, you can manipulate your loadouts to what suits you and your playstyle. Even though I have terrible hand-eye coordination, I can still perform well by using weapons that work well without good twitch/aiming skills like streaks or short range lasers. If fighting with mechs interests you (and if you ever watched Gundam or Macross it should) definitely give the game a try.			"

												Been playing MWO for the last 3 years. To be honest it's been a pretty rough ride but now all you steam people are getting the benefit of that time. The gameplay is fun, and there's no repair costs to force you into premium time like in WoT. High level play is limited largely to player organized events. If you like mechs, they push out mechs as fast as you can buy them, but when it comes to balance changes they'll leave something broken for months, years even. I do not recommend anyone buy the steam packs, they are VERY poor value for a new player.Overall I do recommend the game, it's in a good place now and looks to keep on getting better.			"

												Dabbled in this momentarily in the closed beta, and didn't touch it for 3 years until the middle of 2015. MAN has this game come a long way since then! It's a beautiful game with giant stompy robots, and combat is exciting and never the same in any two games. Sure, it's effectively 12v12 deathmatch for 80% of the quick play games. Noone complains about having only one map on DOTA. each different mech feels different, handles different, and the breadth of customization, while not fully open to anything under the sun, makes spending time in the mechlab sometimes more enjoyable than playing the game itself. You can effectively have fun without paying a single cent (and not be disadvantaged compared to those who pay). However, for those with the money and no time to work the grind, their system allows for a good time-vs-money tradeoff. I've paid for stuff in the game, and have not had any regrets (at all!). Highly recommend it, keep the improvements coming, great job to PGI!			"

												This game isn't quite BattleTech and does have some balance issues. The Pay-2-Win crowd is also pretty fiece and playing a Quick Play match will drop you in a team that's a lot like the Keystone Cops. I have no interest in faction play (it gets way to Tribal in there) and without some sort of story line or AI combat; I can't justify the time I put into this title.The game heavily favors Clan Mech over Inner Sphere Mechs (The in game meta factions) as far as build options and for a perpetual tinkerer like me, it gets frustrating to try and balance a build.There's also a strong vein of elitism and anti-Steam user chatter that will put a lot of us on the outs. There is also no active monitoring of user age. Getting slagged by a kid is one thing, but having to listen to some 11 year old scream into the VOIP and Caps-rage about how no one will do what they're told needs to stop.There are also legal issues at play that will continue to slow or even alter game content. I don't know enough about FASA, the old pen and paper BattleTech IP or the various people involved to make a flow chart, but there is another MechWarrior game in developement and a lot of the old 'Jocks in the Forums are still bemoaning the lack of certain Iconic Mechs in MWO.Give this one another 2 years and another major update. If it's still up and running, go for it. For now, I'd recommend holding off.			"

												First review. I don't tend towards the hyperbolic, so I think all this is fair.Great-F2P done right. Fans of Planetside 2 will enjoy this model. You could grind for ages and still have the best equipment eventually. I ended up paying about $180 and it was all well spent. No regrets. Recommend budgeting at least $80.-Matchmaking. Going up in tiers really helps weed out poor players and griefers. Lunatics will always be present, but you can mute or block them.-Clans. You don't really have to join one. You can find a group of folks and they will always be happy to associate with you. They may be a clan or just other individuals (your friends list).-Mech combat. Well balanced (aside from typical forum bemoaning) that is ultimately gratifying. Go fast, go slow; go long range, go 120m brawler. Whatever you want.-Mechs. Customizable, skinable, and relatively true to lore. You can roleplay yourself as a hardcore pilot or just play casually. Fun fun.Good-Developers keep on developing. They are slow, promises tend to be 2-8 months after delivery date. It'll arrive eventually though.-Content continues to be released, along with rough timelines published each month. New pre-orders are always in the hopper. Enjoyable to watch the options grow.-Faction content/loyalty. I enjoy repping my faction but the differentiations are pretty slight in general play. Poor-The engine has some pretty crappy object hit detection. Not ballistic - think mechs running into each other (weird clipping) and terrain issues. It can't really be fixed without upgrading the software engine...which is probably never.-UI. A bit arduous to do relatively simple inventory management and accounting.			"

												Awesome that this game came to steam, huge influx of players which makes the games a ton funner and faster. i instant Queue now at non-peak hours where before steam-integration it may have taken a minute.one of the best sim games in the steam library, nothing can compare to the tactical play of a co-ordinated lance of four. having some mech's rock anti-missile systems to protect you and nearby team and lance members while another mech runs ECM's and UAV's, the team play is massive. the game can get pretty deep.the game looks beautiful and every mech has it's own personal cockpit, the more you use your mech's the more you master them, giving you small boosts (e.x. 2.5% mech turn speed) and you can customize all the internals, even more so with ""clan mechs"", including your engine size/model, how many heatsinks you install, your weapon platforms, your ammo storage depending on platforms, your Anti-missile-system what kind of metal your mech is contructed of, there's too much to say. when you finally take the time to custom-mod your mech you really feel like it's 'your' mech because you tuned it the way you want to play it.Pay-2-win? there are microtransactions in the game, but they are mostly for appearance (items that can be placed in the cockpit etc.). though you can buy mech's with real cash, you can earn mech platform's (except for 'hero mechs') with in-game cash won by using trial/loaner mechs for a while when you begin, very similar to league of legends. the trial mechs are built well so you wont be underperforming as well. if you are a fan of sim-warfare games, dont miss this one.

Posted: December 17, 2015
												I am a new player of this game in the past week and have already sunk about 60 hours into it. I'm enjoying every minute. I'm going to present some PROS and CONS that I've encountered in my first almost-week of playing, as well as some TIPS for enjoying yourself if you decide to give this game a try.PROS:-Tactical shooter/mech simulation with a surprisingly high ""realism"" factor which enhances gameplay; Is someone killing you with the lasers on their right arm? Simple: shoot their right arm off! Are you overheating? Simple: run in the water so the heatsinks you put in your mech's legs can be more efficient.-Community seems mostly friendly toward newbies. In team-versus-team games, rage and salt are usually everywhere. Especially when you are new and don't know how to play. I've had some mixed experiences, but for the most part the veterans seem willing to help the newbies learn the mechanics.-Different ""weight classes"" and varieties of mechs provide different playstyles. Want to dart in and out of enemy lines, drawing fire away from your allies? Play a Light mech. Want to lead a push and pack lots of firepower? Play an Assault mech.-Customization system for ""bought"" (in-game currency or premium currency) mechs adds to replayability, and allows a single mech to be played many different ways.-It is truly Free-to-Play. There are some mechs which you can only buy with premium currency, however the benefits they provide are being able to grind faster and having different weapon slots. Both of these are things F2P players can thrive without. I will provide a DISCLAIMER and say that Mech Bays (ability to buy and store more mechs), while something F2P players can absolutely live without, will be very very tempting to buy. You can buy and store 4 mechs (enough for Faction Play) without buying any additional Mech Bays.CONS-Steep learning curve, especially for FPS newbies.-It is a team-versus-team game. There are always going to be toxic people who will tell you ""ur bad, git good, ur a♥♥♥♥♥ go back to the kitchen where u belong,"" etc. etc.-It's a Grind. Depending on what you want to do with your mechs, you might end up spending a lot of time grinding in-game currency and XP to upgrade them. This may or may not be a CON for you.-Mech Bays, while not necessary to play the game and not giving any gameplay benefits to players who own them, will be tempting to buy. (With premium currency.) They allow you to buy and store extra mechs, so if you get addicted to this game like I am and want ALL THE MECHS... you are going to have to buy some with premium currency.TIPS:-If at all possible, use VOIP! Your team will love you for it. You won't be expected to lead the team as a newbie; calling out enemy locations (using the military phonetic alphabet[en.wikipedia.org] to make sure you're understood) when they are first spotted and when a Light is skittering around the back line will earn you brownie points, and maybe help you win.-Don't spend your in-game currency right away. Most people recommend waiting until your Cadet Bonus (first 25 games) has expired until you buy your first custom mech from the Store; that way you can get an idea of what does what. Of course, if you see something out in the field and say ""I want THAT one!,"" I wouldn't stop you.-Don't be intimidated by the tutorials! Your best tutorial is out in the field--in other words, your first few Quick Play matches getting exploded. You will get oriented, but not without dying horribly. Ask for advice on team chat (Y) or VOIP (CAPS Lock) if you need to.-Make friends with other newbies. You're most likely to get matched with your peers, so if someone friendly is on VOIP or team chat, don't be afraid to reach out. (Heck, make friends with veterans!)Give this game a try if you think it looks like your thing. Be patient with yourself if the mechanics are giving you trouble. Enjoy yourself.			"

												Pros;  You can satisfy the urge to run around in a stompy robot and shoot other stompy robots with a few basic types of weapons in what is typically deathmatch style combat.Cons;  As old as the game is, it does not feel complete, I have played it on and off for a few years now.  The company that runs it doesn't seem to have the resources to polish the product.  Camoflauge and colors on different mechs aren't free and that is sort of annoying.  The game itself seems to be keeping itself afloat on just repacking old content(old mechs) and selling them at a profit, and designing new mechs every month, while IMO not really having the time or resources to better the product.  The, soon to be reworked, pilot skill tree and module system has felt restrictive funwise by forcing you to enhance one style of play and sticking to it while you acquire XP and C-Bills to unlock other things.  Which feels like a big grind to me.  The Faction Warfare gamemode feels terrible to me, though I could probably get more out of it if I had the time to find a good group of active people, which I still feel would be 12 people farming PUG groups.  Some could argue the balance in the game needs work, some see mandatory upgrades on IS mechs as a neccassary grind to maintain immersion, to me it is annoying to have useless equipment.  Some could say the IS/Clan balance is bad, others might say it was that way in the lore, and neccassary for immersion.  There are lots of confusing aspects of the game to newwer players, like how heat and ghost heat work.Overall, I personally enjoy the game, but it seems to still have a long way to go to be attractive to a wider audience.  The snails pace development is a hinderance, coupled with unfinished and unfun game mechanics that continue to linger.  I have seen in the community forum many talk about the Cryengine needs an update.I don't write reviews, I did this review to get steam awards, feel free to take the opinions as nothing more than a butt hurt noob who needs to git gud and move on and ignore what I say.

												probably the best free to play game in existence. do not get this unless you are willing to take some time getting destroyed while you learn how everything in the game works. its a very detailed mech shooter with controls that make you actually feel like you're piloting a mech. it's not something you can casually hop into and the matches take some time, but if you've been looking for a legitimate team based mech shooter then get it. play it. ensure that it survives.

												I have been playing this game on and off since the closed beta, it is true that its not the greatest game in the world and that there is a heafty price on some mechs if you dont want to grind and want everything now. The actual gameplay of the battles and customization of the mechs in the mechbay is where this game is great. The battles are fought as 3 4 mech lances (squads) so to get the best out of the game you need to work together and support your team (it only takes 1 mech to run off by themselves to turn a garanteed victory into a defeat) each mech class has its own advantages and uses that you will find out from playing.The grind in the game isn't to reach the biggest mechs as you can pretty much get these from the get go and each class plays verry differently suiting different people, if you like to run and gun darting from cover to cover in hit and run tactics then a light mech is your thing, if you like heavy firepower and the armour to stand your ground (because you are not moving very fast) then assault mechs might be your thing but remember even in the biggest baddest looking mech you can still be turned into a smoking wreck in a matter of seconds by light mechs without the support of your team.So I will leave with this, the game is f2p you have nothing to lose so give it ago, compleet the tutorial, use the trial mechs to get a feel for the different classes and find the class that suits you then once you have finished 25 matches and earned all the cadet bonus you should have a fair amount of credits to get a mech of your choice all without spending any real money. So have fun and I may see you on the field of battle mechwarrior.			"

												Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys first person shooters. A slower paced game, great if you want to get away from the twitchy, super competitive madness that is Halo/CoD.Customization in the mechlab is phenomenal. Spending time in the mechlab building and tweaking mechs and testing their effectiveness is half the fun. Anything from armor values on all 8 of your different components (11 of you count the rear armor), weapons, ammo, engine size and type, and equipment, can be relocated and swapped to suit your needs.Anyone who has played any other Mechwarrior title should feel right at home. If you haven't played/heard of Battletech before, I recommend reading up on some guides and strategies before you hop in. The learning curve is steep. You WILL lose a lot at first.Combat is slow and methodical. Engagements will often last several minutes. The feeling of brawling with an enemy mech and having parts blasted off, will keep you on the edge of your seat; especially if it comes down to a 1v1 situation. Being '1 shotted' is very rare and is often the result of bad positioning and multiple enemy mechs focusing you down.PROS:-Solid game play mechanics -The artwork and attention to detail behind the mechs and maps is visually stunning-Mechlab/building mechs is quite fun - Not P2W. More 'Pay to skip the grind'-Huge selection of mechs to buy- Encourages teamwork. Teamwork is often the deciding factor between winning and losing.-events usually every second weekend that hand out all kinds of free goodies-It has adhered well to the original Tabletop stats and rules, which makes balancing hard. But the game is in the best state of balance it has ever beenCONS-The meta game Is very strict-Development is rather slow-Balancing tweaks are few and far between. The same meta can reign supreme for months-The grind can feel overwhelming is you play only for Free.-Lack of tutorials/briefing for mechlab and Faction Play-Game mode variety is limited. Basically Team Death Match over and over again-No real feeling of 'end game' you need 3 variants of a mech to level it up past Basic skills, then Elite, then Master. Master unlocks a module slot, but modules are basically C-bill sinks to improve your mech. A new skill tree is in the works.All said and done, it's Free to Play, and if you enjoy the game it doesn't feel like a grind. Development has grown in leaps and bounds since the publisher broke off from the developers.Good luck and maybe you'll see me out thereo7			"

												If you played any of the older games you'll know what your getting into.Getting started:step 1 : Play some rental mechsstep 2 : Take a look at the store pagestep 3 : Save up for the mech chassis you like moststep 4 : Buy it and customize it into whatever you want it most to be.Intresting things are this game has no tiering system and yet it works great. If you don't want to go crazy you don't have to customize a mech at all, as there are variations on every single one in the store, along with a premium version that earns more exp.Only real con i can come up with is they don't have ALL the mechs I want. But they are still adding them it the order they were made... So if the mech you want isn't in game, it probably will be eventually.All in all I would highly recomend this game if you want to play a mech game that isn't to zippy like some of the ones are today.

												It's not a MMO, it's not a FPS. It's neither a turn-based nor a real-time tactics or strategy game, even though it's based on a tactical board game from the 1980s.It's flawed, eternally stuck somewhere in the middle of a glacial development cycle. You will lose badly, unless you gather some friends and work on you small unit tactics.But as long as shooting lasers at each other from a building-sized bipedal tank will be fun, I'll be playing MechWarrior Online.

Despite everything, the game is growing and evolving.My verdict still is: Try it, it is free but be frustration-resistant at the beginning. It is different ...			"

												This how every F2P should be.When playing free you can basicly get anything that people that pay do.Paying reall money only helps getting things faster, not better.Even the mechs you can buy with reall money arent overpowered or anything special, they only have 30% money collecting bonus (C-Bills)These mechs are alot of the times outrun/outpaced by a mech variant you can buy with C-Bills (free ingame money)The community seems really nice, mostly all helpfull people.Game it self is a nice twist in FPS like games (allthough Mechwarrior exist for many years now)It can become pretty tactical, its not like CoD, Hawken and what so ever.Its also slow paced wich i think make's the immersion of big robots better (you really feel like driving a big F***** up robot) and make like i said the game more tactical.Anyways, Great Game !Just try it, its free !

												I love this game. I had no history with the Mechwarrior series before trying MWO but think the title provides a superb multiplayer experience for patient gamers who want some strategy with their shooter. The free-to-play model is well implemented, if a bit on the expensive side if you have a weakness for cosmetic items like I do. If you are willing to invest time and a little bit of money (additional mechbays at least) into your entertainment, MWO might be a game you'll get addicted to for a long time to come.			"

												It really is free to play.  The rate you earn C-bills (the in-game currency) is high enough that with some minor grinding you can get yourself some really decent 'mechs.  Your first twenty-five matches also pay out at a much higher rate, letting even beginners gather enough money to own at least one good 'mech.  It is monetized, so payng real money is a much faster way to get the 'mechs and accessories that you want - and some 'mechs and options are ONLY available for real money.  Still, it's totally possible to play free; those who spend money on their builds don't have any automatic adantage over pilots who don't.The gameplay revolves around a really outstanding player base - an older crowd, not the bunch you find on COD.  And the developers, three years later, are still heavily involved inupdates and making new maps, gamemodes, and balance adjustments.  All in all this is a great game; it could be improved with a single-player campaign mode, but that is a fairly minor complaint given how free and how enjoyable the game is overall.			"

												As someone who has supported and played this game from closed beta I can honestly say that this game is good.  Not amazing, not superb, but good.  It is by no means an easy game to jump into and pick up, but they are slowly improving and making steps in the right direction.  It has a lot of potential, and for a relatively small dev group it is a solid game.  The current biggest drawbacks for me are the long queue times, broken ELO/BR, and heavy-handed ""balancing"" that is doled out on the regular.  It should still be in beta with the amount of changes they make with each patch and their pricing is definitely not on the cheap side, but the content is good and if you can get a group of friends to play with you regularly this game can be very satisfying.  If you have the time and effort to really learn the game, research, make new friends who can help you learn the ins and outs, or even have a group of friends who are interested in playing, then by all means, pick this game up.  If you're a casual gamer who likes the idea of mech combat and isn't interested in team play, tactics, or focus firing then do us all a favor and skip this game.  Perhaps check out hawken or some other cod-style twitch shooter, MWO is definitely not all about 360 no scoping.			"

												If you are a fan of Battletech this is just about the only online fix you'll be able to get. After the shutdown of Mechwarrior:Living Legends that left this the last bastion.The actual mechanics are ok, the game is more stable nowadays and has a fairly flexible approach to gameplay and the devs (PGI) have stepped their game up a fair few notches. When you can get a good game, with good team mates it's a great game-you certainly can gain those ""gaming memories2 that you never forget:)But, MWO has one HUGE issue and it's one that cannot be solved by the devs...the playerbase.Basically, I've played MMO games since the release of EQ1 and I have NEVER seen such a pro solo, anti group playerbase. a disturbing lack of teamplay in all game modes-even though the game has built in voip and text chat. It even got last year, a solo only queue-a solo mode in a multiplayer online game, that should tell you all you need to know already!It also has a more complex ""clan wars"" style mode simliar to WoT that is currently in 2nd phase of beta testing. Unless you are social and get onto each faction's TS hubs abd actually speak to other people, you will be stuck with the pug lottery. during EU primetime that lottery will mostly give you 11 utterly silent team mates who will make zero effort to teamwork. Shift that to US primetime and the amount of teamwork increases, with mostly Americans being the talkers-but the gameplay DOES improve and I have had some cracking CW matches like that. Best advice I can give you is GET INTO A UNIT AND PLAY WITH OTHERS, the game is great when with others.Last critique is you'll notice that the playerbase is VERY timid, especially in solo queue so if you like team focused, movement heavy games-you'll be VERY frustrated with the solo Q.

												PROS* Play for free, and after 25 matches you have enough money to buy 1 or 2 Mechs* Awesome custom options/weapons/color schemes/ for Mechs (that you own).* Playing with a faction of people you know, or friends, is very satisfying for co-op play.* Mech combat is intense and adrenaline pumping.* The game rewards patience and positioning, not twitch mechanics or picking up drops.* The mechlab is fun, for designing a mech with a weapon loadout suited to your playstyle.* Different mechs play differently, even from light mech to light mech, or Assault to Assault.* Follows the lore (to a certain extent).* Colors bought can be applied to any mech you own. Some can be bought with cbills.* In-game earned credits (cbills) can buy most things, so there are less mechanics that could be singled out as P2W  than in some online games. Hero/Champion mechs bought for MC are rarely the best among variants of a chassis, and so the powerful cbill variants can be had by anyone with cbills instead of real money, nice!* At some point in the future, there will be a PVE game mode or single player campaign (supposedly in development by PGI). Time will tell.* There are free mechs (Trial Mechs) one can use in the game until they figure out what they like, to a certain extent. But none of them can be customized.* Veteran players can now support the game by buying the new mechs that come out (20 dollars a pack, for three) which includes a month of cbill boosted earnings (valued 12 dollars). Yet this will not be great for new players since they will not know what to buy at first (see below in warnings and CONS)* Cool warhorns and hanging items you can put in your cockpits (which can be won for free during events, or paid for if you have money to burn)* If you are a fan of the lore you can join a house or clan of your choosing and fight for planets in the Inner Sphere. The game modes/maps for this are quite different from the PuG matches, and last longer.* Spend some money in the game and there are loyalty mechs/rewards at the end of the year, for various levels of support.* Eventually buying one steam pack here provides a lot of content (30% cbill boosted mechs, cbill boosted earnings for a month, cool paintjobs, cool colors (that cost money in the game), and give mc (mech credits) for buying hero mechs or colors/cockpit items in the game. Though it would be nice if they came with different colors or patterns from pack to pack.WARNINGS, and hopefully things that will change in time:* This game requires a fianacial advisor or tutorial in order to keep new players from spending their first cbills in the wrong way. New players may become frustrated and quit as a result.* New players might buy their first mech based on nostalgia or knowledge of the lore, only to find out neither have anything to do with how the mech plays in the current meta (gameplay). * In Tier 5 (lowest ranked players) Pug matches can seem very unbalanced, and rarely do matches seem even; your team is completely destroyed or dominates depending on how many veteran players from upper tiers were forced to play with you (due to few people being available for matchmaking).* PGI has spent the last couple years trying to balance weapons and mechs, but still a lot of tweaking is required. Often new mechs/patches injected into the game change the way the game is played, especially in faction warfare. * Bad positioning (or teams splitting up) often means you will lose, and unless you are playing in a group of 12 people on teamspeak there is always a chance this will happen.* People love lasers and long range combat, so rarely do groups push into the enemy right off the bat, so matches can seem dragged out to new players that want to face-tank opponents.* Mechs that have a 30% cbill earning boost require real money to buy, but may or may not be the best variant of a chassis. When it is the best, people complain it lies behind a paywall. When they suck, people complain that they wasted their money.* Game modes are somewhat different, but rarely feel different from each other. (supposedly more are in development, but we will see if and when that happens)* Fans of the lore might want to play an Assault Mech (the largest), but to do so well requires too much knowledge of the current gameplay and positioning on current maps. * Make one mistake in positioning and you will die, especially in the higher ranked tiers for PuG. Faster mechs on your team will abandon you when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan, so expect to take one for the team again and again until your learn the maps and how to position.* Clan mechs are crazy expensive, while Inner Sphere mechs are cheap as chips. Newer players might then gravitate to IS mechs, but IS mechs will almost always require a better engine, new weapons, and so on, so the amount of cbills spent to optimize is actually similar.* To fully upgrade a mech with your mech xp you must play with and upgrade 2 other variants of the same chassis before higher level upgrades are available. This requires a lot of cbills, or real money to buy entire packs of mechs in one shot.* A lot of mechs have become obsolete, or were never very good. This will not be readily apparent to new players unless they do some research on google, or metamechs.com.* Positioning, twisting & shielding (to spread damage when being shot at), and weapon ranges are things that can't be picked up in a day, and require a lot of practice in-game. The learning curve can feel brutal at times.* Inner sphere mechs were given isane quirks in order for them to compete properly with the Clan mechs, which means they are specialized for one or two styles of gameplay usually and so new players really have to do their homework before buying one. CONS, and things that are unlikely to change: * Cbills are hard to get as a novice player. And to get a general boost to cbill earning requires about $12 a month, so often you will be tempted to pay for it to lessen the grind.* The ""Trial mechs"" are rarely outfitted to one's liking, and do not have any modules on them (which help veteran players stay alive longer, or kill more effectively). While a veteran player in a trial mech might still be dangerous, a newbie in a trial mech is cbills for the taking. Trial mechs are few in number and rarely change. You could wait months or years to see a mech you wanted to try in this list. As a result, players simply go in blind most of the time and buy the mechs before being able to try them out.* While new players are grinding cbills, veterans can spend theirs freely on optimizing their mechs with modules (that add efficiencies to various systems on a mech) and cooling abilities to reduce or eliminate heat from their mech when they get too hot. This means they can out DPS anyone who does not have these on their mech (because once your mech gets too hot, you must slow down or stop your rate of fire). Even some in the community call ""pay to win"" here, and so these elements can rub people the wrong way. *Unlocking modules not only takes a massive amount of GXP, but then they must be paid for with cbills (2 - 6 million) as well! New players want to spend money on new mechs, not grinding to optimize; this works against the best part of the game which is being able to try new mechs.* If you want to leave the module on a mech and never move it you have to pay cbills again to have a copy of said module.* XL Engines for IS mechs turn your mech into a fast moving glass canon (if you lose a torso section, you die), while Clan engines are fast and allow you to lose one torso section and stay in the game. Many argue that this causes balance issues in the game.* Long range missles make the game a hide behind cover and shoot simulator at times, and only in the higher tiers does this change, a little.* Faction play is very unforgiving for new players, and where many of the elite players join up to play.

												It's pretty asinine to see so many negative reviews from other Legendary Founders who ""have been playing non-stop since launch"" but hate everything about it.  If the goal is to turn-off new players using the cumulative ratings then good job.  The game, as it stands, is not a BAD game.  It's been a bad game, several times, but since I've started playing again I have a fresh perspective and it's not as bad as some of you people make it sound with regards to new players.  The grind is the only valid complaint newbies should worry about.			"

												Tried it at beta, didn't enjoy it to much..... felt p2w. Second go around, things have changed signficantly. Earning both experience and in-game currency feels like a breeze and even with trial mechs If you've ever played or enjoyed robot/mech games; you need to give this game a shot. This game requires you to play smart... a rarity these days, and to stick together as a team. I notice those that go in rambo style are the first to die.... quickly may I add. Also up your graphics on intitial load. (if your comp can take it). It defaulted mine to medium and a low res.Hope this helps. (I rarely write reviews, but this game was to hard not to)  "

												The biggest thing wrong with this game ATM is pinpoint damage. The only recital shake right now is when you have jump jets going, They nerfed the effectiveness of jump jets to counter jump sniping rather than simply addressing the need for recital shake while a mech is in motion. The faster you are moving the more it should shake if you do not have both feet on the ground the shake should be dramatic whether jump jets are being fired or not.. ohh my would that have fixed the jump snipeing far more effectively then what was done.  If you think of the whole game as still being a beta product it is fun and fine I get annoyed when I realize how long we have been out of beta with what still feels like an unfinished product but it is slowly moving forward.

												I like this game.  I have been playing on and off for a few years before it came to Steam.I played the table top version a bit in high school and it does a good job of capturing the feeling of driving a massive mech into battle, losing an arm here and there and finishing the fight a smoking hulk of burnt metal.  It's worth having a look at if you like BattleTech or giant fighting robots in general.There are many kinds of mechs and many good builds for different play styles.			"

												I played some MechWarrior Online when it was first in beta, and I did not care for it. Now that it has been polished up and fine-tuned, it is a really excellent game. It has plenty of customization options, all the mechs you could want, and a good community of pilots. The only thing I don't like is some of the out of game menus. They are not very intuitive, but you get used to them. Also, the game is free, so give it a shot!			"

												Good gameplay. Prices on real money items are a bit crazy.worth putting a bit of money into, but they seriously would make a lot more if they just had a more moderate real money cost on their items.Have played it a while before it came to steam, so play time is a bit misleading.Give it a shot, do the tutorials for some bonus cash. Personaly, I realy love it - recommended.			"

												Been playing since 2010. Great game. However, for the best experiance it does take a LOT! of practice and trial and error. you have to find the PERFECT mech, and equipt it with the PERFECT loadout. if you then go on to spend 50+hours mastering it, then you are practically unstopable.......

												So .. after my first 42 hours in the game I can say it has grabbed me and will probably be my primary game for quite a while.If you have ever enjoyed a Mechwarrior Title then you will probably enjoy this.The learning curve is pretty steep and I highly recommend the community resources that are available when you get stuck, but it is well worth putting in the effort.It is Free to Play and there is no noticable ""Pay to Win"". It does have ""Pay to not Grind"" and ""Pay to Early Access"". However even the ""grinding"" does not feel like grinding, since just playing the game to your preferences will gain you the Ingame Resources you require at a reasonable pace.			"

												I came into this game with 0 hype and now I cant get enough of it!   The variable mechanics make this game very deep and leave you theorycrafting at work or at the house.  I found myself at work just thinking how to most efficiently gear out my mech.  Any game you start day dreaming about is a good sign that it's well made.  You have to manage heat or your mech shuts down in battle,  distance rating on the weapons you choose, weight of the gear on the mech, and slot management.  This game is 1000x deeper than any other shooter out there.  The gameplay is also very fun.  Do you want a fast mech that runs circles around the heavies but softer or a Heavy laser vomiting monster thats more powerful but slow?  Do you want to run lasers, missles, or ballistics?  How about a mix of those?  Close range or long range?  This game is amazing!			"

												There's a lot of♥♥♥♥♥♥that pisses me off about this game.  It's either expensive or pretty really grindy to keep a decent stable of mechs. The faction warfare is a chokepoint snoozefest and few play it.  The ranking system the match making uses is a glorified experience bar and is nearly worthless which causes bad matches for new and old players alike.  Some of the mechs are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and PGI has a really hard time avoiding power creep with new stuff.With all that honestly said, the gameplay is damn fun and it keeps me coming back.  There's really nothing else quite like it.  There's a nice high skill ceiling, and team play both casual and tournament is really satisfying.  The community is pretty cool and chill for a team based online game.I'd say it's probably worth trying out for most people.  You do get a nice amount of money to start with.  Join a like-minded team for the full experience and the most fun.			"

												i dropped out of this game just before the clan invasion, not because of the selling of those mechs or anything, mainly because i was spending way too much time playing it and was about to run out of free time. that and the lack of Aussie servers at the time, but now that there are Oceanic servers, making it abit better i think i may be jumping back into the cockpit occasionally. i'd like to build up a couple more to have more to choose from.If you want to try something that involves a deal of caution and thinking before acting and team work to win, give it a try			"

Have you played War Thunder, World of Tanks/Warships, Robocraft, Hawken?If the answer is yes to those F2P titles, Mechwarrior is another entry to the genre of tatical, partial-simulator FPS. Slower than your average FPS, grindy as any other, with a skill curve sure to be steep.Have you played Arma or Operation Flashpoint?It is much simplier sim/combat than Arma or OF, harder than your average FPS. It is more Battlefield than COD, with the team depedancy of TF2. And even a good team can end a game in a crushing defeat.ContentIt is slow to release actual features but mechs are frequent, and I would consider maps release acceptable. Early access to mechs cost money like the recent trend of games. Weapons are tweaked like all good F2P games despite the whinge.MonniesThe most efficient use of money is mechbays. Or if you want to spend less time grinding then premium time and mechbays. No purchase will guarrentee you victory (although may increase your odds). Time spent learning the pace of the game, learning your mech, observing when your team mates are aggressive or hesitant; these are a few points of focus in the first 10 hours of gameplay (I'm a slow learner).It was my lifestyle game, I'd play it every day for 2 years. According to my madstats I have clocked 528 hours of in-match game time (tinkering not included). If you think it mech combat might tickle your fancy and don't mind F2P, you have nothing to lose. If you only have time for AAA games, you probably want to give it a miss.Currently on a break (picked up elite dangerous) and I'm waiting on something different changes before I return.			"

												I've been playing this for over 2 years.  The developers are continually adding new content and improving the game...sometimes its a step back before 2 steps forward.It's not an easy shooter.  It takes effort to get good (knowing the meta, learning different chasis and their weaknesses, positioning and targeting with different weapon systems, etc...).  One must also learn that working with ones team is vital.  Even the best players are easily taken down when isolated from their mates.  MWO is also about strategy: which mech you bring, how you build it, when & how you engage, which weapons you fire, etc...This game is already a first class shooter; It sets the standard for stompy robot shooter games.  It has a rich lore in the Battletech universe.  But, it has potential to be much better.However, it falls short in the meta game...the game really offers nothing beyond shooting opponents in different styles of mechs.  The community warfare mode needs a lot of work.  The war between the Inner Sphere and the Clans fails to engage.  Even to the extent that teams can make a minor impact, the fruit of these efforts are largely meaningless.  Individuals fail to reap any tangible impact from their efforts.  That combined with battles that are often one-sided as skilled teams drop against randomly grouped pugs...and the mode can quickly become discouraging...even for a top tier player.Overall, I enjoy the game.  I am critical because it could be great!			"

												Plain and simple, if you are looking for a run in and kill game, this is NOT for you.MechWarrior Online takes time and patience to learn all the aspects of the game. Highly custimizable Mechs, but a LOT of grinding to afford Skill Upgrades, Weapons, Modules, and other items needed to build to suit your playstyle. PUG (Pick Up Games, or running without friends) are usually chaotic, for people tend to run about without a plan. Playing with Friends does make things easier and more enjoyable (for most). MechWarrior Online is the only game that interests me enough to keep playing. Most of the players are like me, a bit older and like games with planning and strategy. Plan, Communicate, and work together then things work in your favor, even when PUGgingGood Hunting			"

												I backed this game quite a while ago in hopes of a game to fill the giant fighting robot shaped hole in my heart, and was extatic at the beginning, but something just seems a bit lacking. Maybe it's just being stuck in the same mechs for such a long time, and the ""slow"" speed at which you get money, but I find it hard to play this game for longer that a few minutes at a time anymore. I'd still recommend this game to anyone who likes giant robot fights, but just realize, you're gonna grind a lot to get that Atlas.			"

												It looks decent, and it plays well. At least through the tutorial, but once I got through that, I found there was no content to speak of.  Just some 'practice missions' and matchmaking. I was expecting a MechWarrior RPG game, with characters and a story, but it turns out that it is essentially a MOBA, and I detest those. I like storylines with a world to explore, and characters to love or hate. Something to fight for. Not random skirmishes with strangers.It does seem stay true to the BattleTech lore, and how can piloting a giant death robot not be fun?I won't say it's bad just because it's not my thing, because I wouldn't know a good MOBA from a bad one, as I've only played enough of them to know I dislike that style of game.If you like those sort of games, then give it a try. If you like missions, with storylines and places to explore, then avoid it. Still it's free, and if you are a fan of the BattleTech universe, it's worth at least checking out.  You may find you like it. I wish there were more options than yes or no. Because I would recommend it to those who like these style games, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone who likes RPGs.			"

												MWO is possibly the best free to play game I've played, but then again, it's the only free to play game that has huge sod-off stompy robots in it (Hawken doesn't count because they're more Ballerinas than 'mechs). Oh and machine guns don't cost 10 quid like some F2P games do. *Looks at Planetside 2*Oh and I have played since closed beta in 2012. For whatever that's worth.But yeah, onto what makes MWO good and better than atleast 100% F2P launches on Steam in 2015.IT'S NOT P2WShock, horror a F2P game on Steam that isn't P2W? The humanity!Sure you can pay for 'mechs with the ingame MC and they can be rather expensive, so my advice? Don't, it's easy to rack up money with the cadet bonus which extends to 25 games netting you around 10mil, the tutorial gives you like 5 million to start and doesn't force you to purchase stupid things for the sake of a tutorial that 5 mil it gives you, is all yours. Speaking of money, let's talk in game money 'mech prices. The cheapest is currently the Locust, a 20 light 'mech, starting at around 1,388,241 and peak at  1,777,326 C-bills. This doesn't include upgrade costs like Double heat sinks or endo steel structures or even the paramont need for an XL engine, which can easily cost around 5/7,000,000 C-Bills on a light 'mech. The most expensive? The Executioner a 95 ton Clan 'mech that can 'sprint' for short durations, has jumpjets and some of the most tanky hitboxes seen in any Clan 'mech. Ranging from 17,505,967 to 18,142,422 C-bills (In lore it was far more expensive at around 36,000,000 C-Bills so thank God that isn't a thing.)Now looking on this game at the end of 2016;It's mostly in the same place as the same at 2015, co-op seems to be coming at some point in 2017 in theory, revamps for most of the old maps has really helped this game age, HPG is still boring and basically a boring arena map people like because...Brawlhalla. Been a bunch of new 'mechs in 2016, some for the positive, being unique such as the Cyclops, a dedicated Commander's battlemech as well as the soon to be released Linebacker, a 65 ton 'mech that pushes 100kph. Oh and there's a free 'mech up for grabs at the moment until Jan 1st, details are on the website, no strings, just a free code, boom, free 'mech with 30% C-Bill boost, extremely handy for the newer player.I rate this game, legit, 8.5/10, it's a Mechwarrior game, it's not the perfect Mechwarrior game, but they're taking it in a nice direction ever since they seperated from IGP.Play it, see if you can get into it.

												Hello everybody who is gonna read this review il make a short statement herei love this game it has all i need from it the system to custimize your mech to the battle ingame i am part of a clan in game too Golden Foxescheck them out at http://darkjedi.org/club/FOX/ if you are looking for a group to play withnow for what i like hate and all else-the business modle of the game is well pretty grindy il say my self.you have to play alot to unlock most stuff so yes you will be grinding alot to get new mechs weapons modules etc..... but i dont see it as a grind wellbecause  i enjoy playing so much i have fun every battle so that helps now there isnt really anything pay to win per say yes you can get some arty and air strike stufffor mc the real money ingame but that doesnt matter cause they dont do that much from there regular versionswhich you can buy for ingame money.ok now i will talk about packs prem mechbays and more here.ok there are packs ingame and outside of the game on the Mechwarrior online website you can get to into from ingameingame packs are mastery  packs it mostly gives you some mechbays around 3 mechs cause you need 3 mechs from the same chasis to master them that means to unlock all the upgrades for them per say.so yes mastery packs are great for people who dont want to grind to get all 3 mechs and you dont only get 3 mechs as i said you get mechbays with them tooand sometimes prem time and some other cool stuff.now ingame you can also buy champion mechs and Hero mechs il start with champion mechsi wouldent recommend anybody at all to buy any of them they are not worth it cause they dont give you that muchHero mechs on the other hand are worth it  cause they give you around 40% C-bills plus means you earn more money.on the web you can buy mechpacks you can say well its mostly for a specific mech i bought my self the archer pack not saying you should but i did what that means is i am gonna get 4 archers cause i got the collectors oneand some prem time and mechbays but on the site its mostly pre orders you can say so be careful there.now i will talk more about game mechanics.-now as i said you can custimize your mech add this weapon remove that weapon etc... there is alot of stuff you can do there from how much armor to ammo to what engine so yeah at the start it will look really hard to understandit really isnt but i would recommend going to forums or best place youtube to see how all of that workswhen you learn a bit you can start building your style of mechs and trust me you will love it.there is another site for ppl that dont really wanna build there own mechs but do wannapilot the best mechs its called Metamechs it has all the builds for almost all the mechs the bestbuilds most of the time not always but its a great place to start to even learn how to build the best mechs or funmechs doesnt really matter if you like it.now for how the combat is.-Combat in the game is pretty arcady if you played any other mechwarrior games you know its alot faster to kill mechsand do damage and more or on tabletop you can get 1 hit kills if insanly lucky or really big guns in mechwarrior its really hard to get the 1 hit kill even with big alphas yes you can do it to light mechsbut heavy ones well its really hard now in game you have a team of 12 playerson each side i am talking about quickplay not community warfare or just CW but in cw you get 12 players on eachside too but thats not the point here so each team starts at one end of the map but before all of that you get a minigame  per say its where you get to vote which map will be played and which gamemode all 24 players get to vote there for what they want after that you get dropped on the game with the gamemode chosen so yeah.now there are assault conquest and skrmish gamemodes skrmish is just team deathmatch assault is both teams have a base where they spawn if one team gets enough players to the other teams base and caps it it wins or you cankill all playersconquest is like in BF games you have alot of points on the map if you capture them you gain resources you can win like that or ofc killing everyone so yea pretty basic but really fun.well after you are droppend in the game you are part of a lance each lance got 4 players most of the time the lances areweight based so heavy or assault or combined sometimes medium or lights togther and then well you battle it out the good thing is you have Voip ingame defualt key is capslook and you can talk with the players on your team and cordinate this game is insanly team focused so get ready for that but the community is amazing everybodywell almost everybody is insanly friendly and will love to teach you stuff you dont knowwell i belive this has went already for to long i hope this was helpful if you want some questions answer you canalways pm me or some other form if you wanna drop with me ingame or find some other great ppl to play with you can always apply for Golden Foxes great clan we accept new players on a regular bases and we would love to teach you so look at us on http://darkjedi.org/club/FOX/ well hope to cya in game.

												It has been a long journey from the table top version of this game. It incorporates the best parts of all of the digital counterparts as well... Especially if you like piloting a LRM boat. All kidding aside the game offers several ways to enjoy the MW universe. Faction warfare, and straight up team death match. The mechs are mostly balanced, especially during faction warfare where each side has its strong point and weak point to factor strategy around on any given map. PG has been thus far very receptive to player feedback. The game is still in development. Maps, mechs, and changes occur quite often and keeps things interesting. I've been playing since closed Alpha and I have spent almost as much on this as many people spend on Eve online plex.Give it a shot, you get access to trial mechs which grant a bonus to xp and earnings. These change from time to time to keep things fresh.			"

												Great tactical team fps.Several maps and gamemodes (after selecting a mech and getting in a lobby, u all anonymously vote)However the costumization is rather limited.Especially because new mechs and big weapons takes ridicules long to farm (200k cbills pr win, 10-17mil for the largest, most powerfull mechs. Thats around 100 games a 30 min for 1 big mech... Then comes the , 3-6 mil for engines if u wanna change setup on ur mech and easy 4 mil for a small extra module to boost zoom, lock on or other rly usefull stuff). It's litteraly like trying to afford a large beach house by collecting cans from garbage..Then u can ofcause buy mechs and boosts for real money, though these prices also seem way to high. "

												This Game is amazing! although it is extremly hard. ( espessically for a 15 year old with a laggy computer) it will take HOURS to find the right mech tha suits you but when you do, this game delivers very very well. you NEED to work with your team in order to win and you cant just go around trying to shoot other people on your own because even as an assult mech your pretty squishy when 3-4 people gang up on you ( and they will) overall i give this game a solid 8-10			"

												Borderline recommendation, but only because it's an above average game that could be amazing if the developers shifted focus. I'd say there are two issues holding the game back:(1) It's currently a game that's torn between realism/adherence to tabletop Battletech versus focus on gameplay/fun in general. The upside is that they got the basic fighting forumla - the fragging in the basic quick match game mode - down well. It's fun, it rewards aim-based skill, and it rewards good mech loadouts. The downside is that PGI (the developers), have shown that they have trouble understanding the gameplay of their own game, with OP mechs, and then over-nerfs (although eventually they sort out mech balance). Similarly this extends to Community warfare (a special game mode), where realism/adherence to tabletop has made for boring community warefare maps. Case and point is further realism/tabletop mechanics poorly implemented like the CW auto-aim, long-tom artillery which basically fires off a mini-nuke every 2 mins, which kills most mechs in 1-2 hits and has a large radius. It's caused people to stop playing CW in the past - this is just one example. Similarly, PGI nerfed agility and speed of light mechs (a class of mechs) making them them basically underpowered in fights, because that's how they were in tabletop, eventhough lights were balanced before and a very fun class to play, even for the fragging. A third example is that community warfare has more then 8+ factions, making it a total mess with certain factions having too low pops, and others too high, once again imho, because of the focus on tabletop/lore/realism over gameplay.(2) The game is Pay2NotGrind. As a new player you get a huge starting bonus of c-bills that lets you get a couple lights, 2 mediums, or 1 heavy, so it's not immediately noticeable, but put it this way - an average starting player  might  average 100k c-bills per 10-15 min match if they are good (after starting bonus expires), but light mechs typically take 5-7 million deck out; assaults usually closer to 15-18mil. If you're good, you can probably average 150k c-bills/match, maybe higher, but it's still a grind. Thankfully, it's not really Pay2Win, although there are some very good mechs that can only be bought with hard cash; the free to play equivalents are generally just as good. There are also trial mechs (can always be played by anyone without buying them) that are decent as well, though you can't customize them. Overall, the Pay2NotGrind seems to be a purposeful decision by PGI to focus on whales (few players who put lots of money in the game), and this tends to hurt the size of the playerbase.Overall though, it's still a very fun game, and the quick match - individual or group queues - are very fun, even if community warfare isn't. And you can play private games for scrimmages, and there is a very active league quick match scene, so there is real depth to the game. Just a shame that the developers are holding the game back.p.s. I have another 100 hours on the non-steam version of the game, several years back. Also, I'm a pseudo-whale - I've played this game on and off three times (2014, 2015, 2016)  and each time I've spent around $50-60 for a total of about $150-180. That amount has bought me about 12 mechs, mostly heavies. In the same time period of time - or about 200 hours total - I've probably grinded enough money to buy 9 heavy mechs, but I definitely wasted some ingame money by selling weapons after buying them, and then needing them later and having to rebuy them.

												Hello everybody who is gonna read this review il make a short statement herei love this game it has all i need from it the system to custimize your mech to the battle ingame i am part of a clan in game too Golden Foxescheck them out at http://darkjedi.org/club/FOX/ if you are looking for a group to play withnow for what i like hate and all else-the business modle of the game is well pretty grindy il say my self.you have to play alot to unlock most stuff so yes you will be grinding alot to get new mechs weapons modules etc..... but i dont see it as a grind wellbecause  i enjoy playing so much i have fun every battle so that helps now there isnt really anything pay to win per say yes you can get some arty and air strike stufffor mc the real money ingame but that doesnt matter cause they dont do that much from there regular versionswhich you can buy for ingame money.ok now i will talk about packs prem mechbays and more here.ok there are packs ingame and outside of the game on the Mechwarrior online website you can get to into from ingameingame packs are mastery  packs it mostly gives you some mechbays around 3 mechs cause you need 3 mechs from the same chasis to master them that means to unlock all the upgrades for them per say.so yes mastery packs are great for people who dont want to grind to get all 3 mechs and you dont only get 3 mechs as i said you get mechbays with them tooand sometimes prem time and some other cool stuff.now ingame you can also buy champion mechs and Hero mechs il start with champion mechsi wouldent recommend anybody at all to buy any of them they are not worth it cause they dont give you that muchHero mechs on the other hand are worth it  cause they give you around 40% C-bills plus means you earn more money.on the web you can buy mechpacks you can say well its mostly for a specific mech i bought my self the archer pack not saying you should but i did what that means is i am gonna get 4 archers cause i got the collectors oneand some prem time and mechbays but on the site its mostly pre orders you can say so be careful there.now i will talk more about game mechanics.-now as i said you can custimize your mech add this weapon remove that weapon etc... there is alot of stuff you can do there from how much armor to ammo to what engine so yeah at the start it will look really hard to understandit really isnt but i would recommend going to forums or best place youtube to see how all of that workswhen you learn a bit you can start building your style of mechs and trust me you will love it.there is another site for ppl that dont really wanna build there own mechs but do wannapilot the best mechs its called Metamechs it has all the builds for almost all the mechs the bestbuilds most of the time not always but its a great place to start to even learn how to build the best mechs or funmechs doesnt really matter if you like it.now for how the combat is.-Combat in the game is pretty arcady if you played any other mechwarrior games you know its alot faster to kill mechsand do damage and more or on tabletop you can get 1 hit kills if insanly lucky or really big guns in mechwarrior its really hard to get the 1 hit kill even with big alphas yes you can do it to light mechsbut heavy ones well its really hard now in game you have a team of 12 playerson each side i am talking about quickplay not community warfare or just CW but in cw you get 12 players on eachside too but thats not the point here so each team starts at one end of the map but before all of that you get a minigame  per say its where you get to vote which map will be played and which gamemode all 24 players get to vote there for what they want after that you get dropped on the game with the gamemode chosen so yeah.now there are assault conquest and skrmish gamemodes skrmish is just team deathmatch assault is both teams have a base where they spawn if one team gets enough players to the other teams base and caps it it wins or you cankill all playersconquest is like in BF games you have alot of points on the map if you capture them you gain resources you can win like that or ofc killing everyone so yea pretty basic but really fun.well after you are droppend in the game you are part of a lance each lance got 4 players most of the time the lances areweight based so heavy or assault or combined sometimes medium or lights togther and then well you battle it out the good thing is you have Voip ingame defualt key is capslook and you can talk with the players on your team and cordinate this game is insanly team focused so get ready for that but the community is amazing everybodywell almost everybody is insanly friendly and will love to teach you stuff you dont knowwell i belive this has went already for to long i hope this was helpful if you want some questions answer you canalways pm me or some other form if you wanna drop with me ingame or find some other great ppl to play with you can always apply for Golden Foxes great clan we accept new players on a regular bases and we would love to teach you so look at us on http://darkjedi.org/club/FOX/ well hope to cya in game.

												I've always wanted to write a proper review for this game but I still can't be arsed to write a lengthy, detailed writeup over a video game; everything I'd want to say has already been said again and again anyways. So I'll just get down to the important stuff.This game has its pros and cons but the important thing to remember is that it -IS- free and if you play semi-regularly the grind doesn't really feel too hard. Everything performance-wise you can get with real money you can get with in-game money except for Hero mechs, which aren't even remotely P2W but do have unique playstyles and loadouts compared to their standard variants. Also, some of them look sexy as hell. (Most of the pay model in this game is cosmetic btw)There are a LOT of mechs you can pick from and decent variety between the individual models. You can customize the loadout and there's a fair bit of playstyle flexibility for MOST of the mechs. However, this game suffers from a terrible state of ""forced"" meta due to the way rebalancing is handled (or not handled), making things considered non-meta really hard to be competitive in. Still, if -you- like it and you can put in the performance, go for it and do you. All my clan mechs are ballistic-based and I love the unexpected facetime and carries I get against people expecting pulse vomit or streams or other meta Clan stuff.This game hates AMD FX processors!!! Full stop. It's a known and somewhat long-term issue and, while not incapacitating, can be really frustrating because it causes small, infrequent hiccups/bottlenecking during gameplay. For everyone else, this game has the optimization of a flint axe! Bear that in mind if you crank up the graphics settings. However, the mechs on higher settings look amazing, as do the particles and shaders. The LODs are terribad but I guess that's the price you pay for super-sexy giant stompy robots with full first-person cockpit views.Another big con for this game is that the developer doesn't always make the best or brightest decisions in regards to balance passes and content updates. But!!! Things have been way better in that department in the past few months/past year, and we actually got the new CW when they said they would put it out, so that's refreshing.TLDR: Should you play this game? Yes. It's free. It's fun. There's no P2W. At least give it a shot before you decide you hate it.			"

												Having Played the original Mechwarrior series years ago, i was absolutely thrilled to see this title on Steam.Despite being a very different game i still love MwO. This game has a solid learning curve and being F2P amassing wealth and exp to buy mechs and upgrades takes a good while if you choose not to Pay real money. However... that time is definately worth it. I have not been playing this for long and allready i like the community. I will most likely sub the game pretty soon if i continue to have as much fun playing it as i have now. This game needs support and i will do my part for sure.A little list of positive and negative things about the game...Positive:- Good and friendly community- Great potential for epic team battle provided you have a good strategic leader.- F2P. It is actually possible to build very deadly mechs without using real money- Some awesome maps with very good looking graphics despite still providing good strategic points.- High learning curve... Means you won't get bored soon if you have an ambition to matter in the game.- You Pilot Mech's ... Who wouldnt want to pilot a 100 ton Mech? Think Pacific Rim... Seriously... Mechwarfare!!!Negative:- F2P has its drawbacks... Hopefully Piranha Games wont pull the plug anytime soon and make enough cash to see the game as a financial success.- Steap learning curve means that you propably need to love the genre to stay in this universe for long.- Some maps are awesome while others are downright awfull. - F2P Speed at wich you can gather wealth is pretty slow so you really need patience here...- as far as i have seen no support for multi monitor... wich is sad if you have the system to carry it.i would give the game 8/10 points tilting towards 9/10 but there is still room for improovement. If you are into the Mech Genre... This game is a MUST HAVE!!! If you are not... you will still have lots of fun.			"

												There are few games that have the astounding range of customization with such a huge array of ""charachters"".  The rewards systems and your ability to purchase mechs, and build your ultimate ""Deck"" to battle with is a wonderful combination of forethought and all out brawling.  It's kind of like a shooter combined with hearthstone, but there is no magic...  Probably not missing much with that.  If you ever played the board game or any of the previous mechwarrior games I think you will enjoy this rendition.  It takes some getting used to, you'll have to do some reading.. But it's worth it.

												My First Real Game was Mechwarrior 4 vengence, black knight, and Mech Commander seeing my favorite mechs with way better graphics and people to play with made me so happy, when I say this game it made me even more happy when I saw it was free to play, ive been reading the reviews and Ive got to say that this is not P2W ive been able to take down paid users with crappy little starter mechs, its not the money you put into the game its how you play it its about developing your piloting skills you don't need all the fancy paid stuff you just need to practice well yet again its easy for me to say when ive been playing mechwarrior my entire childhood but you dont need pay money you just need to practice thats why im a little disapointed at all the people saying this is P2W sure some might think it is but its really not. All I can say is is that I really recommend this game to anyone.			"

												This is my all time favorite game.  Ive been playing for 3 years now and I still get home and want to play it in the afternoons.I came from CS:GO where I spent alot of my time being gunned down by players who were just quicker than me.  MWO is a thiking mans shooter, as the slogan goes.  It doesnt so much matter about raw reaction time but more planning and awareness.I imagine the initial learning curve can be harsh, once you get your cadet bonus, have a look around online and see which mechs are recommended.  Alot of this game relies on finding the right combination of mech and weaponry and there in lies the fun.  So many mechs to play, so many build types, so many formulas.  1 person can be good at a certain style and another a totally different style.  Finding out what works is amazing.Give it a go and stick with it for a while.			"

												Been playing on and off since beta and I highly recommend this game if you want a different kind of FPS experience. The gameplay is slower and more tactical than about any other FPS on the market, not only in the way you have to focus on team play but also how you have to fight. With the ability to destroy parts of the enemy mech you have to make choices in the heat of the battle, do you go for the kill by destroying the center torso or do you first destroy their ability to fight efficiently by destroying their weapons (arms and/or side torso)? The game gives you a lot of different possibilities on how you want to fight, just keep in mind, this game will punish you hard of you try to do the ""Rambo"".The game has its problems, game balance is a big one that has plagued the community for a long time. With 3 big weapon kinds (laser, ballistics, missiles) and with different weight classes and kinds of each of those makes getting everything equally  viable, very hard. And since the two factions both have their own variants of almost all the weapons with range, dmg etc differing between them, I imagine that its hell to make it all balanced. PGI do try and each patch has new tweaks to make it better. (Some times they do fail big time! ;) Graphics and sound are really good, all crankt up the game looks amazing, sadly turning the settings down gives you an edge since you will have better visibility due to less particles in the air, less effects from weapons etc. Seen some people saying that there is pay2win in MWO, but there isn't, there is no weapons, armour, ""gold ammo"" etc you can buy for real money. You can buy colours, skins, cockpit items, premium time (extra XP and cash rewards) and mechs. The newest mechs are only available for cash for a time after release, they will then come available for in-game currency. And since ""new"" mech doesn't equal ""best"" mech I fail to see the problem with that. F2P games need to make money and this is probably the best way they can do that with the player count they have. There is no content locked behind levels or any such nonsense (looking at you WoT, Warframe etc ). You can buy any mech in the game if you can afford them, want the first mech you buy to be a 100ton murder machine? No problem, with the in game currency you will make from completing the tutorial and your 25 first matches will reward you with extra cash (Cadet bonus, I believe that still in effect?) you will have lots of cash to spend on your first mech, I would recommend that you don't buy the most expensive one you can find, read the forums for great tips on what to go for depending on what weigh class you want to play.Try it and don't give up just because to die without killing any one your first match! Believe it took me 5 matches before I got my first kill and man was it rewarding after all the fail in previous matches! ;) I also recommend checking out the forums, MWO has a great community and will help new players with tips and tricks for getting started. Many will also drop in game with you and help you, great community of guys and gals! "

												   If you like Mobile Suit Gundam, Macross, Pacific Rim, or even played any of the BattleTech games (tabletop from the 80's or video games in the franchise) you'll want to give this one a go. It fills in that niche giant robot slot you've been craving.   The game appears like your poorly-interactive-MMORPG at first glance (it took me a couple days to figure out just WTF is going on in the Mechlab), but once you get the hang of the wealth of information presented, it becomes much more intuitive. Every piece on the screen, in-game or in-menu, serves a purpose and tells you something. It just takes a bit to get used to it.   The piloting segment of the game is very fun but is a challenge to do well. Many aspects are occuring at once, and it's up to you to manage them all effectively (ex. heat management, ammo, presenting armor, etc.). If you are a tanker (World of Tanks, War Thunder, Armored Warfare, etc.) you can apply your knowledge directly to this game and do pretty well. If you aren't, the learning curve is about the same. The idea is to play smarter, not harder. Coordinate with your team and you'll likely take home the big money.   My biggest credit to this game after playing more Pay2Win games is the free-to-play model. The game is very much playable for free; in fact, the game will help you grind for your first 'Mech, and even so, supplies you with ""rental"" Trial 'Mechs throughout the game. There also isn't a progression tree, so you choose what you want to play, grind it out, and get the one you want. Beyond that, the Mechlab will allow you to customize the components on your 'Mech to suit basically any playstyle (look up B33f's Direstar build: it's a riot!). All of this is free, you don't have to pay a dime to them. The cosmetics of your mech will be what they grab cash out of you on, but that is entirely optional.    After seeing so many dull, indless games come up, it's good to see a game that requires a good mind. I would definitely recommend this game.			"

You don't have to wait for the perfect team to enjoy the game. Match making works well enough. It's not really a pay to win game either. Even if someone gets a heroic mech, they still have to know how to pilot it well. Lots of configurations and mechs to choose from will keep you occupied for a good while.

												Dont let the ""Hours Played"" stats fool you. It doesnt include the 355 hours played before MechWarrior: Online even came to Steam. I have been nuts about BattleTech since the 80's, and joined up MW:O during the closed beta. Absolutely love and addicted to this game!! If you love BattleTech, MechWarrior or even just Mecha in general, this game is a must. Join a local unit, makes some friends and get stuck in!			"

												It's a functioning game. Competetive with a good free to play model. Expect to spend around $10 for extra mech bays if you play for a while. Cosmetics are fairly pricey. Actual gameplay components such as new mechs, weapons, and gear is earnable at a quick pace for a free to play game. It is at its core, an arena shooter. For a battle tech game, time to kill seems a bit quick. But it is still much slower than an average FPS. Some matches can be an absolute joy while others can be the exact opposite.I have mixed thoughts about it as a whole, but the good times just barely outweigh the bad.			"

												Having Played the original Mechwarrior series years ago, i was absolutely thrilled to see this title on Steam.Despite being a very different game i still love MwO. This game has a solid learning curve and being F2P amassing wealth and exp to buy mechs and upgrades takes a good while if you choose not to Pay real money. However... that time is definately worth it. I have not been playing this for long and allready i like the community. I will most likely sub the game pretty soon if i continue to have as much fun playing it as i have now. This game needs support and i will do my part for sure.A little list of positive and negative things about the game...Positive:- Good and friendly community- Great potential for epic team battle provided you have a good strategic leader.- F2P. It is actually possible to build very deadly mechs without using real money- Some awesome maps with very good looking graphics despite still providing good strategic points.- High learning curve... Means you won't get bored soon if you have an ambition to matter in the game.- You Pilot Mech's ... Who wouldnt want to pilot a 100 ton Mech? Think Pacific Rim... Seriously... Mechwarfare!!!Negative:- F2P has its drawbacks... Hopefully Piranha Games wont pull the plug anytime soon and make enough cash to see the game as a financial success.- Steap learning curve means that you propably need to love the genre to stay in this universe for long.- Some maps are awesome while others are downright awfull. - F2P Speed at wich you can gather wealth is pretty slow so you really need patience here...- as far as i have seen no support for multi monitor... wich is sad if you have the system to carry it.i would give the game 8/10 points tilting towards 9/10 but there is still room for improovement. If you are into the Mech Genre... This game is a MUST HAVE!!! If you are not... you will still have lots of fun.			"

												Being a founder means i've seen teh game go through a lot.1. You need to honestly pay 15-20 bucks to get the most out of this game. Buy a mech you think is cool, unlock stuff, grind for stuff, get a few kills.2. The game isn't balanced, meta changes all the time. I can't keep up but I don't care it is still fun.3. Think of these things as tanks, position is important, don't charge head on.4. The grind is long if you don't pay but I haven't dropped any money on it since clans debuted and I still find it fun.*TL/DR, grind is long money helps, but just have fun and get behind the big mechs.*			"

												I pretty much enjoy this game for a long time. My opinion on the ""free2play vs. pay2win"" discussion is, that is is helpful to start by buing a mech-package. But in the end(game) it doesn't mean that much. If you enjoy this kind of battlesimulations and want to put a lot of time in it, you can grind your way towards your favourite mechs for free!

												This is my all time favorite game.  Ive been playing for 3 years now and I still get home and want to play it in the afternoons.I came from CS:GO where I spent alot of my time being gunned down by players who were just quicker than me.  MWO is a thiking mans shooter, as the slogan goes.  It doesnt so much matter about raw reaction time but more planning and awareness.I imagine the initial learning curve can be harsh, once you get your cadet bonus, have a look around online and see which mechs are recommended.  Alot of this game relies on finding the right combination of mech and weaponry and there in lies the fun.  So many mechs to play, so many build types, so many formulas.  1 person can be good at a certain style and another a totally different style.  Finding out what works is amazing.Give it a go and stick with it for a while.			"

												       Greetings fellow Mechwarriors.Being a fan of the battletech universe since the late 80's, I have to say Ingame graphics have sure come a long way.the game play is like most other games out there, You winn some matches and you'll lose matches. The ratio of Win/loss is all up to you, you really do need to use your head in this one cos If you just go running in guns a blazing you'll surely over heat, shutdown, and get destroyed. If work with your team and use your head you'll greatly increase your chances of a win and having a great match win or lose.Personaly I would not recommend using a HOTAS. The keyboard and mouse work just fine if not better than the HOTAS setup.			"

Posted: April 10, 2016
												Been playing on and off since beta and I highly recommend this game if you want a different kind of FPS experience. The gameplay is slower and more tactical than about any other FPS on the market, not only in the way you have to focus on team play but also how you have to fight. With the ability to destroy parts of the enemy mech you have to make choices in the heat of the battle, do you go for the kill by destroying the center torso or do you first destroy their ability to fight efficiently by destroying their weapons (arms and/or side torso)? The game gives you a lot of different possibilities on how you want to fight, just keep in mind, this game will punish you hard of you try to do the ""Rambo"".The game has its problems, game balance is a big one that has plagued the community for a long time. With 3 big weapon kinds (laser, ballistics, missiles) and with different weight classes and kinds of each of those makes getting everything equally  viable, very hard. And since the two factions both have their own variants of almost all the weapons with range, dmg etc differing between them, I imagine that its hell to make it all balanced. PGI do try and each patch has new tweaks to make it better. (Some times they do fail big time! ;) Graphics and sound are really good, all crankt up the game looks amazing, sadly turning the settings down gives you an edge since you will have better visibility due to less particles in the air, less effects from weapons etc. Seen some people saying that there is pay2win in MWO, but there isn't, there is no weapons, armour, ""gold ammo"" etc you can buy for real money. You can buy colours, skins, cockpit items, premium time (extra XP and cash rewards) and mechs. The newest mechs are only available for cash for a time after release, they will then come available for in-game currency. And since ""new"" mech doesn't equal ""best"" mech I fail to see the problem with that. F2P games need to make money and this is probably the best way they can do that with the player count they have. There is no content locked behind levels or any such nonsense (looking at you WoT, Warframe etc ). You can buy any mech in the game if you can afford them, want the first mech you buy to be a 100ton murder machine? No problem, with the in game currency you will make from completing the tutorial and your 25 first matches will reward you with extra cash (Cadet bonus, I believe that still in effect?) you will have lots of cash to spend on your first mech, I would recommend that you don't buy the most expensive one you can find, read the forums for great tips on what to go for depending on what weigh class you want to play.Try it and don't give up just because to die without killing any one your first match! Believe it took me 5 matches before I got my first kill and man was it rewarding after all the fail in previous matches! ;) I also recommend checking out the forums, MWO has a great community and will help new players with tips and tricks for getting started. Many will also drop in game with you and help you, great community of guys and gals! "

												for a new players!!! You will certainly have problem how play this game.U have 6 buttons how to fire (of course, you can fire with only 2 buttons it depends how much wepons you will have) and alternative fire, where you will shot with all yours weapons, higltly recomended mose with additional buttonsfirst battles: broblems with gameplay, you will make small damage, no kills, hard to profess, you are only dying and do you think you are useless. do not worry to ask someone, how it works or what to do and how to play it, witch weapons is better or worse and how to use them, everythink is on youtube or on theirs webside; but everythink depends how do you want to play it ( if you like to kick them a@s, of help your team for long distance, or be little thug scout)and there is main tips, how to play: 1. try to not get hit (even get destroyed) 2. comunication is key to victory 3. choose your enemy thoroughly 4. leave your team only if it si necessarilynext is witch battlemech buy first, you have 16 battlemechs to try for free, and if you do not like any mech from the offer, everytime you can see on the internet how players play other mechs.next and last think is mechlab, for the first time it will be hard to confess in it, first try it on the trial mech, there you can not spoil it, because you can not save. but mainly, you have to imagine it before you save your mech, because changing is very expensive, I recomend to have best engine.NOW if you follow these rules, you will be promoted to highter tear ;)			"

												I've played this game off and on since it was released and it's amazing fun. Intense combat with a high skill ceiling.

												   If you like Mobile Suit Gundam, Macross, Pacific Rim, or even played any of the BattleTech games (tabletop from the 80's or video games in the franchise) you'll want to give this one a go. It fills in that niche giant robot slot you've been craving.   The game appears like your poorly-interactive-MMORPG at first glance (it took me a couple days to figure out just WTF is going on in the Mechlab), but once you get the hang of the wealth of information presented, it becomes much more intuitive. Every piece on the screen, in-game or in-menu, serves a purpose and tells you something. It just takes a bit to get used to it.   The piloting segment of the game is very fun but is a challenge to do well. Many aspects are occuring at once, and it's up to you to manage them all effectively (ex. heat management, ammo, presenting armor, etc.). If you are a tanker (World of Tanks, War Thunder, Armored Warfare, etc.) you can apply your knowledge directly to this game and do pretty well. If you aren't, the learning curve is about the same. The idea is to play smarter, not harder. Coordinate with your team and you'll likely take home the big money.   My biggest credit to this game after playing more Pay2Win games is the free-to-play model. The game is very much playable for free; in fact, the game will help you grind for your first 'Mech, and even so, supplies you with ""rental"" Trial 'Mechs throughout the game. There also isn't a progression tree, so you choose what you want to play, grind it out, and get the one you want. Beyond that, the Mechlab will allow you to customize the components on your 'Mech to suit basically any playstyle (look up B33f's Direstar build: it's a riot!). All of this is free, you don't have to pay a dime to them. The cosmetics of your mech will be what they grab cash out of you on, but that is entirely optional.    After seeing so many dull, indless games come up, it's good to see a game that requires a good mind. I would definitely recommend this game.			"

You don't have to wait for the perfect team to enjoy the game. Match making works well enough. It's not really a pay to win game either. Even if someone gets a heroic mech, they still have to know how to pilot it well. Lots of configurations and mechs to choose from will keep you occupied for a good while. If you want a mech game to play, this is the one.			"

												DEFINITELY WORTH A DOWNLOADI just started playing the game December 2015 and within a week I've put almost 80hrs in. This game is addictive and tons of fun if you play with a group. Its good alone, but I imagine it could get really frustrating once you understand whats going on. If you decide to go ahead and get into this, know that the first 20 mil or so C-Bills you make is much easier than the rest due to bonuses from leveling, and many of the factions have dedicated faction teamspeaks if you want to get into faction play. Also know that focused fire on particular components is always more lethal than things like rockets. So skilled shooting and knowing when to turn to take hits will make all the difference when brawling. 9.9/10 Best multiplayer game I've played this year. I only regret the population isnt higher in faction play for faster matchmaking (get in faction teamspeaks to accelerate the matchmaking). "

												As someone who came into this game with little to no prior expirience with Battletech/Battletech universe lore, ect i'll just run down the pros and cons of this game.Pros:-Free2Play setup- realistically, its hard to play this game without spending money. Much like all F2P games, theres the freemium curency, and without it, you dont get many ""mech bays"" for housing mechs you purchase. I dropped 20$ twice on this game in total, soley for more of these mech bays and ground for the in game curreny to buy more mechs and mechparts.-Simple mechanics- You join a match, move forward, shoot people with your weapons until one team is dead.-Limited Weapon types- you know what all 4 types of weapons do (Missle, laser, ballistic), they either just get bigger and do more damage or shoot faster/have a longer range-Flexible Loadouts- The mechs are totally customizable to your liking depending on what what the mech is specialized for and what you're looking for. You want a bigger engine for more speed? Cut down on the amount of ammo you want, or make the engine more exposed to critical hits. Take long ranged weapons that dont work in close range combat, or stack up on short ranged dumbfire missles. The choice is yours.-Mech Building- Honestly this is the most enjoyable part for myself. I'll build the most unothrodox mechs to just have fun and screw around with. I'll take a massive mech thats suppossed to be slower, and throw in a massive engine with only a couple weapons and zip around like im a light-scout mech. Theres alot of leeway with that kind of stuff and I have  ablast with it.-Decent Community: most people in this community are chill, and will even help you. There is a small group of toxic players, mostly pilots that flame their team mates because they die doing something stupid, but the vast majority are players that have been following mechwarrior for years. They helped me out alot, and I found a group to play with in and outside of mechwarrior because of it.Cons:-Meta or bust: The game revolves heavily around meta builds/playstyle, especially on the Community Warfare hub. If you arent playing the most optimal builds, you get thrashed match after match, even if your skill is on par (**** Kodiaks- end of story)-Group heavy: The game requires coordination, planning, and teamwork- solo que can be cancer. Find some friends to play with and this problem is easily fixed.-Strict F2P is rough: If you dont plan on spending money at all, then you might want to get used to the monthly free-prebuilt un-customisable mechs, because you only get 3 slots for customizable mechs.-Desire to learn more about the lore: This may just be me, but bein thrown into a world I knew nothing about just didnt suit me, so I found myself spending hours on the wiki learning more on the battletech wiki.-Skill tree- Skill tree grants bonuses to mechs based on expirience with it, but without the bonus's, the mechs dont operate at the peak, out of the box, efficiency, which really hurt some mechs. All and all, I'd give the game two different scores:Strictly Free to Play: 4/10Spend what you want to: 7/10			"

												This game is pretty funny for who interested in giantic mechs and powerfull lasers. So thats why avarage of players age is high i think. Dont ask why... in my oppinion; +3 sizes of mech is good for PvP mechanics.+Various mechs.. There are too many.+Maintaining the MechWarrior soul. ( for me ) +Friendly fire. lol+In-Game voice chat...-When a mech explodes, the effects are so insufficiant. You can hardly understand that you explode it. I think better explosion effects would be attract more people to game. -Laser hit effects are cool but can be better. -Faction wars used to be so bad but it is okay for now but sure it is still improvable.-Mechs can be more functional by various weapons. -There could be more detail about mechs or weapons. Its good for PvP.-Well this game needs many innovations because it is so available for it. Science-Fiction. -And the most important problem of this games are hacks i think. Yes.. There are hackers and they are too many of them. They are making the game unpleasant to play. So it needs to be solved as soon as possible. So i think with a few basic changes, this game could be more good. More quality effects is a need i think.			"

												Coming into the game fresh without all the baggage of the relationship between the devs and the community, I love it.  I play a lot of WOT and WOWS and it plays about the same.  Good tactics are rewarded over twitch gameplay and teamwork exists a little bit even in the quick matches.Pros-solid slower paced gameplay-good maps-trial mechs are great for ftp-free to play, haven't put a cent into itCons-graphics could be better-outfitting your mech is the most painful process ever, I have never seen a more useless UI with cluttered crap, no explanation, and info hidden behind 4 doors.  Thankfully that's just when building mechs and does not ruin gameplay in the slightest-no real single player?  I'd pay $15 for a good single player like back in the old days, start with a baby mech, work your way up, etc			"

												This game is great. Played a lot of beta before it was on steam. My first ever PC gaming experience was Mech Warrior 2, and this consistantly reminds me of that. The nostalgia is real. Game is solid and fairly well balanced. Lots of maps and a few different game modes that creates some very interesting matches. Quick game play is fast paced and the que times are short. If you're looking for a solid mech game, this is the one. The F2P model is decent, and the wallet warriors don't really have much of an edge over new players as the game gives out large amounts of free currency for you to use. There is a HUGE amount of customization available for your mechs. With some skill and some time invested you can easily whomp on people. Great game. Super solid Mech Warrior experience.			"

It does take some getting used to, movement, control, and shooting wise, but nothing compares to the satisfaction and enjoyment of building your own mech and going out on the field with it. Pretty damn fun, do recommend if you don't mind grinding a bit for your first mech and weapons systems.			"

												This is a great addition to the MechWarrior franchise. I've been playing it for years and PGI (the developers) keep making improvements. I wish the real-world prices for some of their mechs was a bit lower, but otherwise they've done a very good job of keeping things balanced and not letting only those with real cash get an advantage.The key to success is patience. Stay with the group, concentrate on the same target(s) as everyone else and don't wander off alone or stand in the open. Don't play this like you're in a Gundam. I personally find this game a lot more enjoyable when I play with friends.Oh, and in case you were wondering, this game is PVP only (for now). No solo campaign yet.			"

												Ah, MechWarrior. Can you believe it's been 20 years since MechWarrior 2 hit shelves in all of its floppy disk glory? Upon entering MWO, despite how modernized this title is by comparison, I felt an instant rush of nostalgia -- a throwback to the days of other treasured mid-90s games like Descent. Obviously, the mechanics in MWO greatly differ from its old-school predecessor(s) but the tutorial was relatively quick and simple.I will say that the system requirements listed on the store page seem to be underqualified for this title, giving my GPU (Radeon R7 240 2GB DDR3) fits even on mid-low settings but gameplay is still surprisingly smooth. Unlike most of the MMOs available via Steam, the MWO community is seemingly overwhelmingly friendly. To be fair, I haven't even logged a full hour yet but in my three matches, interaction with friend and foe alike was peaceful and informative even.I'm looking forward to investing more time into this title going forward and give it a resounding 10/10 already.

												6/10The main thing this game has going for it is that there are no other mech combat games. If It wasn't for that I couldn't recommend this game. Only having 3 game modes is downright lazy. Pros:- Decent Graphics-You feel like a mech pilot-matchmaking doesn't take longCons:-If you play solo it is common to get put on teams with no communication or ability. This game is about teamwork far more than solo gameplay. So you get put on these terrible teams that kill themselves like lemmings and there is little you can do to win the game. This game really sucks to play solo. -Matchmaking as a group puts you up vs very good players even if you are a noob.-Many invisible barrirers on objects blocking shots-Have to grind a lot to get money and xp to unlock or buy stuff for your mech-The only game mode people want to play is skirmish (TDM) out of the 3 game modes. -Auto Locking missile spam-Graphical bugs with textures popping in and out-No melee combat mechs-Overpriced Mechs			"

												After playing a fair number of hours I have to say that I really enjoy this version of Mechwarrior.  There is a constant montly influx of new mechs to play and PGI seems to do a lot of work on patching, revising and updating the game.  I have a lot of fun.However, this game isn't for those who don't want to invest time learning a new system.  Designing mechs and understanding how to stay alive during a match require thought and a little theory.  A few google searches will do wonders if you are having trouble.The Best Googling results:https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bmIEjECA6IbWRm92vmylZNv2QYVc5gXO7CT9jMITOrM/edit#slide=id.g265838452_00mwo-builds.nethttps://www.mechspecs.com/Mech Design Tool: mwo.smurfy-net.de/mechlabP.S. Don't spend your c-bills on mechs/upgrades until you completely understand Mech Mastery (XP) and have a number of Trial Mech matches under your belt.  Also, Inner Sphere mechs are 30-50% cheaper than Clan mechs.			"

												Its a pretty fun game. I really enjoy the concept of people able to modify your armor and weapons loadout. You have limitations, including a total ton limit and certain parts of the mech can only hold certain types of weapons, and you have ""slots."" But within these, you can do just about anything you want. You can stick a really big engine and a bunch of machine guns all over your mech to make him fun to play with but annoying to other people, but to do this you will probably have to sacrifice armor. Or you can load your mech down with lots and lots of missiles but you probably won't have much room for other upgrades. You can choose to protect your ammo, or risk it exploding. You can switch standard heat sinks with more efficient doubles, or ferro fibrous steel instead of the standard in order to make your mech a lot lighter.The main problem I have with this game is money. In the beginning, the game does give you a ton of money for your first 25 games, but you better use this very wisely. I am a mediocre gamer, not bad, not great, and I average 75,000 per battle. So I would expect a really good gamer to earn 150,000-200,000 at best. The cheapest that you can buy a new mech is around 1.5 MILLION but the good ones are going to cost you at least 6-8 million, and the best reach 15 million. Even just buying a new engine will cost you at least a half a million. And very simple, small weapons like machine guns and small lasers will cost you 10-25,000 and it only gets more expensive from there, with some getting close to a million. The point being...it takes FOREVER to make any real progress in the game. If it weren't for everything being expensive and it taking a long time to earn the money, this would definitely be one of my favorite games, but unfortunately things are expensive and the game has simply become tedious as I have only had 2 mechs since getting the game a couple months ago.Perhaps the game designers intended for you to have this problem though. They do give you trial mechs that you can play with for free and automatically change every so often so you can still have fun using those. All in all, not a bad game.			"

												A tentative thumb up.It's a fun game with a few caveats depending on what type of gamer you are. The 'stomping death machine' part is done well but the lack of alternative game modes (essentially just team death match atm) will wear thin quickly. The Community Warfare mode currently in beta is a step in the right direction but considering it's been dangling since 2013, it may or may not turn out for the better.The hook of the game is living the dream of piloting the dozens of mechs from the Battletech universe. Unfortunately, the F2P grinding required is one of the worst I've seen and even in real money terms, mechs and various cosmetics etc are very expensive. In the end, if you are a fan of Battletech like me and willing to plunk down at least $30, you'll have a good time. If you are looking for COD+Titan Fall then please step away.Edit: MWO shines in team work and does not reward individual heroics. As such, a mic will significantly increase your enjoyment of the game. Even as a noob, your paniced warnings will be appreciated by your team who usually are too busy to read text boxes. As an experienced player, calling out tactics, seeing them obeyed and turn the tide of battle is pure, fist pumping joy. Community is generally well behaved since the high skill requirement will deter teen Rambos quickly.			"

												Don't let the past MWO, it's earlier problems,upset users and IGP dissuade you, PGI has turned this into a very fine game & one of the last holdouts for lifelong Battletech/Mechwarrior fanatics while making it accessible to all.  It's current state has a good variety of machines, a good, mature community, and large scale persistent factional warfare.  There are genre and some playstyle/mechanic/cash store similarities to games like World of Tanks, and the purchasable machines do not (despite claims otherwise) possess godlike pay2win powers.  It's a slow, deliberate game, meta game, and progression.  If you miss Mechwarrior 1-4, Battletech: Solaris, Mechassault, or the legendary Battletech tabletop miniatures wargame & it's accompanying pen & paper rpg Mechwarrior, this is for you.			"

It takes some practice just to get your machine going in the direction you want it to, but fortunately they do offer a training academy that is slowly getting better as time moves on. I recommend running through the academy several times in order to get a feel for the machines.Another word of advice: Considder changing some of the option in the game. Turn on Torso Twist, for example. It's better to learn now, before you develop a bad habit. Secondly, set it to first-person mode. It just makes the experience that much better. I would couple this with nudging the ""FOV"" slider up, to you can see out all of your windows. If you're a battletech fan, this is a good Battletech game. Forget what the naysayers yammer about. I've been playing since 2012, loggin on averag over 40 hours a week. Yes, there is a bit of a grind, but nowhere near as bad as World of Tanks. Yes, there is premium content to purchase, but none of that will guarentee victory. Mostly, premium items and 'Mechs have a cosmetic value to them. Most of the actual builds can by built on standard, non-premium machines.If you like a multiplayer game with a bit more thought to it that the endless deaths of Call of Duty, consider this title. Not only do you get to lumber across the landscape of alien worlds in a machine massing between 20 and 100 tons, you will also be rewarded for utilizing proper team tactics. The only truly ""overpowered"" component to this game is teamwork. Everything else can be countered. There is also a very large number of 'Mechs to try out. Find the weight class that suits you best, and you will be left with plenty of options for play, further expanded by the ability to completely customize your Battlemech. I would avoid Faction Play until you've gotten comfortable both with your 'Mechs, and the fact that you tend to die a lot. Faction play is pretty brutal right now, and dropping in without a team can be very frustrating. The takeaway? This is Mechwarrior. If you've ever been a fan, whether it's from the tabletop game or MechAssualt, then this is the latest chance to imagine yourself in the cockpit, controlling 75 tons of heavy armor and even heavier weapons.An excellent game that is constantly improving. Highly recommended!			"

												I've played MWO for going on a year and a half.  My experience is that this a playable game with a readily-mastered learning curve, some very friendly communities, steady growth in available product, and a lot of fun.  Although I am relatively new to online gaming I find it measures up well in entertainment value to every game I have looked at since.  I happily recommend it to anyone looking to play a fast-paced SF-themed MMO.			"

												This game is great. Played a lot of beta before it was on steam. My first ever PC gaming experience was Mech Warrior 2, and this consistantly reminds me of that. The nostalgia is real. Game is solid and fairly well balanced. Lots of maps and a few different game modes that creates some very interesting matches. Quick game play is fast paced and the que times are short. If you're looking for a solid mech game, this is the one. The F2P model is decent, and the wallet warriors don't really have much of an edge over new players as the game gives out large amounts of free currency for you to use. There is a HUGE amount of customization available for your mechs. With some skill and some time invested you can easily whomp on people. Great game. Super solid Mech Warrior experience.			"

												This is a great addition to the MechWarrior franchise. I've been playing it for years and PGI (the developers) keep making improvements. I wish the real-world prices for some of their mechs was a bit lower, but otherwise they've done a very good job of keeping things balanced and not letting only those with real cash get an advantage.The key to success is patience. Stay with the group, concentrate on the same target(s) as everyone else and don't wander off alone or stand in the open. Don't play this like you're in a Gundam. I personally find this game a lot more enjoyable when I play with friends.Oh, and in case you were wondering, this game is PVP only (for now). No solo campaign yet.			"

												Ah, MechWarrior. Can you believe it's been 20 years since MechWarrior 2 hit shelves in all of its floppy disk glory? Upon entering MWO, despite how modernized this title is by comparison, I felt an instant rush of nostalgia -- a throwback to the days of other treasured mid-90s games like Descent. Obviously, the mechanics in MWO greatly differ from its old-school predecessor(s) but the tutorial was relatively quick and simple.I will say that the system requirements listed on the store page seem to be underqualified for this title, giving my GPU (Radeon R7 240 2GB DDR3) fits even on mid-low settings but gameplay is still surprisingly smooth. Unlike most of the MMOs available via Steam, the MWO community is seemingly overwhelmingly friendly. To be fair, I haven't even logged a full hour yet but in my three matches, interaction with friend and foe alike was peaceful and informative even.I'm looking forward to investing more time into this title going forward and give it a resounding 10/10 already.

												This is an amazing game with very good visuals and effects. It is also a great team game and the mechs are quite balanced. Want to be a slow assault mech carrying tons of weapons armour and ammo? Prepare to have your back raked by light mechs. Heavy and medium mechs are balanced weapon platforms. Light mechs are skirmishers. Alot of fun to play.			"

												This game has been around for a long time and the developers continue to work on it.  Despite the ""negative"" complaints from detractors, this is the best mech simulator out there.  The 12v12 battles feel epic and you don't respawn per round.   Your mechs are tough, powerful and EACH person's contribution matters.Graphics are good, and there are no pay2win elements.  The best mechs / top tier mechs are available for free.  You grind for money only if you want more mechs in your stable.Overall, I'm very happy with the game and obviously they are doing something right as the servers are still very active with lots of players.I encourage everyone that loved mechwarrior or just a more tactical FPS shooter to come take a look - it's free and they give you a bunch of mechs to trial.Disadvantages?  There is a learning curve as this does NOT play like quake/doom/call of duty.    More like World of tanks with better configurability and sci-fi elements. "

												Finally, a great sequel for a mechwarrior game. I started out back with mechwarrior 2 Mercs. If you played 2,3, or 4 I think you will find this quite an enjoyable experience. Grinding can be a bit lengthy to buy new mechs, and the mech packages are INSANLY expensive... Some $200! Enjoyable game nontheless. My recommendation is save all the recruit achievement c-bills you make when you first start so you can at least buy 1 decent mech to start with.			"

												After playing a fair number of hours I have to say that I really enjoy this version of Mechwarrior.  There is a constant montly influx of new mechs to play and PGI seems to do a lot of work on patching, revising and updating the game.  I have a lot of fun.However, this game isn't for those who don't want to invest time learning a new system.

												EDIT: Review assessment changed to 9/10, simply because of the amount of content and reworks coming our way in the near future; looks like PGI is listening to the fans after all.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~About time I wrote a review for my most-played game as of late.I've been a fan of BattleTech for a little over a decade now, since I was 4 or 5 years old, and I have failed to find another franchise which comes close to the feel of it. I'm gonna have a major rant on the background of these games, so if you wanna avoid all that scroll way down until you see a nice big train of tildes. 0_0This series follows a unique dystopian science-fiction setting (which is actually very plausible) where man has overcome the limitations of Earth and settled across the stars. Yet our sinful nature has not been left behind, and a multitude of factions exist after the collapse of the Star League in the 28th century. Four succession wars have been fought since, and the persistence of the human traits of greed, betrayal, and need for war have perhaps never been more evident.These wars are fought on a number of fronts: among the stars through jumpships and warships, in the skies through aerotech, and on the ground through infantry and the tanks which have now been in use for over a millenia. However, a breakthrough happened which would permanently change the face of war.In 2439, the Terran Hegenomy developed the MSK-5S prototype, commonly known as the Mackie; this was the first true BattleMech. While primitive by 31st century BattleMech standards, the prototype was a complete success, practically obliterating its test targets consisting of four Merkava heavy tanks. This ushered in a near arms-race age while the Star League still reigned supreme, in which perhaps hundreds of BattleMech models were released by the different Great Houses and other factions united under the League, with the technology available for these walking tanks constantly improving along the way.Tensions rose, however, and with the Great Houses eventually waging war on each other in the First Succession war, the defeated Star League Defence Force retreated to beyond the Periphery and Inner Sphere space currently known to man, taking their knowledge of BattleMech technology with them. These forces, over the course of a few centuries, developed their own societies and militaries, and would return to the Sphere under the name of the Clans.Meanwhile, relentless, unfading war between the Great Houses caused the rate of technological progress to come to a halt, and with the loss of the most advanced BattleMechs in these wars, the Inner Sphere eventually degraded to a point of lesser technology by the 31st century, so much so that the BattleMechs that were in such number during the Star League age were now a rare commodity, only piloted by the nobility, the highest-ranking officers in each House, and the richest mercenaries.Then came the Clans to give the Inner Sphere a little bit of a wake-up call. Converging from the Periphery, the Clans initially steamrolled all resistance until the influential Battle of Tukayyid in 3052. The Great Houses, still hostile towards one another, realized that they would have to put aside their differences until this new threat was sent back to where it came from.And we've only scratched the surface of the lore this series has to offer.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~That's where MechWarrior Online comes in: the conflict between the Inner Sphere and Clan is at its peak, and individual factions within both sides aren't exactly the most friendly with one another. To top it off, mercenaries are profiting off of this turmoil all the while. The Faction Play aspect of this game captures this side of MechWarrior almost perfectly: you can choose to be a loyalist, mercenary, or even a freelancer, all with their own benefits.Of course if that's not your cup of tea, the rest of the game has plenty to offer. The MechWarrior series has always had plenty of customization potential, and never before has the series had THIS much customization potential. The plethora of 'Mech chassis and variants, weapons, equipment, upgrades, and modules provide for an impossibly high number of build options. If customization is your thing (and I know it's mine), I can confidently say you will be WOWED by this game.The gameplay itself is very tactical: IGN put it pretty much perfectly by calling it a ""thinking person's shooter"". But don't worry, there are guides on Steam that will give you a run-down on all the tips and tricks of this game. Joining a casual or competitive unit will further your game experience by providing you with a well-coordinated team, as opposed to dropping in with random people.Balance is not an issue for the mass majority of the time you'll be playing, so not really anything to point out there.The game also updates every month, though these patches usually consist of new mechs held through a paywall for a few months and minor gameplay changes. There are also events held semi-regularly which provide in-game currency (standard and premium) as well as both cosmetic and useful items.If you are a previous BattleTech fan, this is a must-have. It doesn't have the campaign, Solaris arena, or instant-action modes that the MechWarrior series is so well known for (bummer :/), but it excels in pretty much every other way.If you're new to the series, all the stuff this game has to offer can be a little hard to get used to, but it's pretty intuitive and there's a simple tutorial. Additionally, you can find a series veteran like myself; we'd be glad to help you learn the ropes.Overall I'm gonna put aside my BattleTech bias and give this game a 8.5/10, there's stuff to do for sure, just not as much as there coud be.

												I've been trying to quit this game for 3 years now but it's the only thing out there that scratches that itch.  I've been drawn to the Battletech universe ever since my older brother started bringing home the Technical Readouts and miniatures back in the 80's, so nostalgia is indeed a factor for me.  That said, the lack of any single player content or story is actually a huge negative for me when considering a recommendation.  In fact, there have been plenty of negative aspects of this game over the years that is difficult to justify.  Game balance is slow to adjust, and when it does it's drastic (to be fair, it's actually in a decent spot at the moment).  Monetization is not for the feint of heart or wallet.  Game design is pretty uninspired, every game mode is essentially a variation of team deathmatch.But despite it's flaws, I keep coming back.  For 3 years I've been able to rely on this game to satisfy my mech piloting needs.  In all that time I've never had trouble finding one of those heated matches where all the maneuvering, skill and teamwork all come together to create a highly rewarding experience.			"

												If you're a fan of battletech this game is a must have. It's the long awaited continuation  of the Mechwarrior series with an amazing roster of mechs and a complete customization system. There is also unit play to conquer areas of the inner sphere. The community warfare system is still fairly young with a lot of growth ahead of it, despite it alone offers a lot of content.The packages like most free to play games are a bit pricey however nearly every mech in the game is avaible for in game currency (c-bills) with the exception of hero mechs (special variants with +30% c-bill earning) and staggered releases on new mechs (Pre-order Release, Premium Currency Release, In-game Currency Release).Highly recommended even if not a fan of battletech or simulators, it comes off as a great tactical shooter.

												I've been a Mechwarrior fan since the original PC game in 1989.  The bulk of my Mechwarrior experience has been with MW2: Mercs where I ran a unit called ComStar Mercenaries.  Ahhh those were the days....no easy multiplayer interfaces....limited options....however Mechwarrior has always been on top.  After Microsoft's mutilation in MW4 I had started to lose hope in the series.  Then, out of the blue MechWarrior Online appears and war had returned to the universe!  The graphics are very good, gameplay is a little imbalanced in favor of the Inner Sphere(IS).  Community Warfare is an awesome part of this game allowing players to play out the changes in the game universe.  It will be nice if they add an interface similar to MW2: Mercs where you can sign up for smaller contracts and gain loyalty with other factions or lose loyalty if working against a faction.  Choosing a path for loyalty is also a good way to make some friends and work together toward a common goal.  I've chosen my path with Clan Wolf, which path will you take?			"

Fully customizable, tons of regular events with the devs throwing out freebies even before Steam launch, and as a result, i do make purchases with real money, Forums though need to take things shared with a pinch of salt, they tend to complain a lot, but there are awesome ppl who do dish out helpful commentary and insights as well.End of the day, the only constant is change, so as long as they keep improving the mechanics, i don't see myself stopping ever to play MWO.

												I played a lot of Mechwarrior 2 back in the day.  About a year ago, I googled Mechwarrior and this popped up.  I didn't even know they were still making MW games.  I've been playing ever since, and I enjoy it.  I like the slow play style, and this game does not feel ""pay to win.""			"

												I was an original Elite Founder of this game when the funding campaign launched in 2012...before Steam Greenlight and many other community funded games.  I eagerly backed at the Elite ($60) level and chomped at the bit for ever to get into the game and then I did.  I was elated with how fun the game was in it's early days and was enthralled with the promise of what was to come, so my friends and I waited eagerly for that content...and waited...and waited...eventually got frustrated and stopped playing feeling like we had wasted $60 on broken promises.  That's what things were.  We backed the game with that understanding but PGI's approach was not that same as what you see on Kickstarter or Greenlight today...they did it all independantly.  So in short, we kept up with what they were doing for a while hoping to come back one days and things just seemed like they were going down hill and the game was going to crash and burn.When we saw it launch on Steam, my initial thought was ""Well, one last ditch effort to keep the game alive it seems.""  Then one day we were talking about it and decided to pop in one last time to see if things had changed...and were very surprised.  So now I have over 70 hours in the game in less than two weeks and am eating crow.So, I may not agree with everything that PGI did when they got started but I think they've been trying to find a way to make it work and had to grow some thick skin in the process to keep things afloat.  I'm not defending them by any means but this was an early learning lesson in crowd funding a game.  Lots of things they promised came very late or are still not in the game today.  That's OK, I'd rather them get it right but they had issues communicating this to their backers.In short, mistakes were made and some people are still mad about it.  I'm happy now and hope to see more of the content come to fruition.Would I recommend this game?  Yes, so long as you know what it is and isn't.  There are plenty of reviews that details this info, but in short:-  This is not run'n'gun, you do you die, fight alone, die alone-  Teamwork is essential for victory as is communication-  It is a slow paced progress to improve your mechs, do not expect to buy your way to victory.  Even if you put hundreds of dollars into it, you still have to grind the XP for your mechs to improve them-  The controls are complex but intuitive once you learn them-  The game is for a mature audiance and by that I do not mean 17+ because of language and nudity but because the players are primarily veterans of the Mechwarrior games from the late 90's/early 2000's.  That doesn't mean you shouldn't play, just be aware that it's not a game for those of little patience-  Yes, they ask for money.  You can buy mechs outright or grind out money and items.  The game is NOT pay to win and you can play it completely free if you're willing to take the time to work through it.  The stuff you pay for is getting mechs/equipment early or for cosmeticsSo, if you're looking for a game that requires true tactical teamwork, has arguably fair pricing, looks amazing and can feel pretty rewarding then this game is something you should check out.

												Been playing it since open Beta, sure lots of ppl complain about the added mechanics like Ghost Heat, Gold Collector Mechs etc. At the end of the day, i'm glad i still stuck through all the changes and this is the only online mech sim i play. Fully customizable, tons of regular events with the devs throwing out freebies even before Steam launch, and as a result, i do make purchases with real money, Forums though need to take things shared with a pinch of salt, they tend to complain a lot, but there are awesome ppl who do dish out helpful commentary and insights as well.End of the day, the only constant is change, so as long as they keep improving the mechanics, i don't see myself stopping ever to play MWO.

												Good F2P game, most of things you buy with real money (like camo patterns, camo colours, stuff like that) is  overpriced for what you get, but the F2P grind is easy and they give you a bunch of almost perfectly kitted out ""trial"" mechs you can use to grind money with to buy your own mech. The combat is almost entirely skill based apart from missiles, which do have a bit of a random spread, the balance is great and their ideas to add ""quirks"" to balance mechs that have bad hitboxes was a great way to make subpar mechs be competitive without changing the shapes of iconic designsThe CW is a letdown though, both with the gameplay you get out of it and the rewards you get out of it			"

Sometimes you'll just get exploded into bits.This game is very fun and isn't pay to win from what I've seen.

												I enjoy playing MWO and will recommend it but will also point out the positives and negatives of the game from my eyes as well.The positives.It is a very good mech ""shoot em up"" game. Perhaps one of the best i have played.There is a vast selection of mechs, most of which can be purchased through the in game currency. It is truly a Team Game, meaning that usually the team that communicates better most likely wins.The developers explain their plans with the community as well as answer questions from the community from time to time.The developers constantly run events during weekends and holidays that can net you extra mechs, ingame currency, and sometimes even Real money currency.The negatives.As a new player, the learning curve is very harsh. It will take some significant time to learn most of the nuances of the game.Additional Mech Bays cost Real currency (MC) which means after your first 4 free mech bays you will have to spend  MC to gain additional Mechs.The Community Warfare is a hollow shell of what it should be.  It is nothing more than Team Deathmatch to take over colored pixels which mean absolutley nothing. Hopefully this will be adressed in the future, but to this point it has not.These are my honest opinions of the game, if you like a "" shoot em up ""  mech game and are willing to spend time learning the game , like to work as part of a team, then this is probably the game for you.

												There is a lot to be said about MWO, and most of it is good. The graphics are nice. The customization of the mechs is nice. The handling of the mechs is great. It all feels ""right."" There are plenty of memorable and epic moments to be found even though the missions are typically fairly short. The maps are nice and varied, allowing for the different classes of mechs to have environments where they fair very well in one game and very poorly in another. This adds challenge and forces adaptation of play style. Updates are still occurring, including new mapes and, recently, a new play mode. The system by which mechs and skills can be upgraded is reasonable and does not always require actual money for the transactions. I have played over 100 hours without spending a dollar, though soon I plan to make some purchases - there are things worth buying, after all, you just don't HAVE to buy them. This is definitely not a pay to win game.Generally, if you like mechs and PvP on-line games, its pretty good. I spend some time with it almost every day. Now for my only gripe:The only thing wrong with this game is the number of trolls playing it. Sure, die first and then spend the entire rest of the round typing about how everyone else and their mech loadout sucks. Sure, pilot a light mech and then refuse to acquire targets so that the slower but more powerful long range mechs can use your scouting to rain hell down on your enemies. And let us not forget the necessity of having a mute button so that we don't have to listen to the constant nagging of the 5 different ""commanders"" in every company. This game is designed to be a team event - consistantly winning any of its various mission types requires team work and an understanding not only of your own mech's/ lance's capabilities and strengths, but also an understanding of and cooperation with the strengths and capabilites of the other lances you are fighting with. Never the less, almost every single mission ends up being a free for all skirmish followed by idiotic critiques by people who have too much time to type while everyone else is fighting. This is why I don't usually play on-line games. And more than likely, it is what will drive me away from this one.			"

												I recommend this game, with some caviats.The gameplay is generally pretty solid, the visuals are beautiful, and the audio is very satisfying. 'Mech customization is very thorough, and combat is supremely fun. It requires a lot of teamwork, and is slower-paced than a typical shooter.However, waiting for Community Warfare matches can be very frustrating. This area of the game seems particularly poorly designed. I frequently wait 10-30 minutes on a match, which for the most part renders this mode unplayable for me and a lot of other players.Because the game is entirely dependent on teamwork, whether you win or lose a match doesn't have as much to do with individual skill, and so when you wind up on a team full of noobs or uncooperative players, it's a landslide loss. That's usually how matches go. When your team works together and communicates, win or lose, it's incredibly fun, but the overwhelming majority of my matches involve silent, uncooperative, and/or seemingly bewildered players, which unfortunately has a dramatic effect on the quality and trajectory of the resulting gameplay.The ranking system isn't particularly fair. I'm a good player but remain stuck in the bottom-ranked ""tier"" 5 because my teams lose most of the time. You can have a great match, sticking with your team, doing lots of damage, pulling off great tactics, and your rank will still go down if your team loses. It can be frustrating when you are stuck playing with new and low-skill players because your success is overwhelmingly dependent on the team effort. I understand that wins and losses should play into your ranking but they need to adjust the formula to account more for match performance.Combat is far too focused on the use of Long Range Missiles (LRM's), the ""noob tubes"" of the game. Not only do they do quite a bit of damage, but they lock onto you and can hit you behind obstacles (except for tall buildings or geographical features). There is also a consumable item called a UAV that allows the enemy team to spot you without having line of sight, making the use of these LRM's even easier (granted, UAV's can be shot down but they don't show on your minimap). What this means is that the overwhelming majority of matches play exactly the same, regardless of game type (Assault, Domination, Skirmish, etc.)--you hide behind obstacles while people with LRM's slug it out, and this involves a lot of waiting because LRM's have double the range of smaller energy weapons. It's just a shame for the most boring and easy-to-use weapon to be so dominant in almost every single match, more so on some levels than others of course.The game has been out for several years and the updates pretty much focus on release of new mechs, so I doubt any of these issues will be resolved, and may or may not even be regarded as issues by the developer or the broader community, depending on who you ask.

												Pros:- Immersive Battlemech Combat;- Galaxy Map and Faction War with real dropships and planet capture/control;- Player Owned Mechwarrior Units both mercenary and loyalist;- Solo Carreer possible as freelancer, contracted mercenary and loyalist;- Good hearted community;Cons:- Takes forever to make money in-game and thus acquiring mechs/gear is a terrible grind (you'll have loads of fun right away if you have a few hundred $US to spend on it);- Quick match has long wait queues, tonnage enforcement and map/mode votation mechanics;- Faction matches are almost exclusively tactically focused - only very well organized units have access to strategic gameplay;- In Facion play, you are limited to either Inner Sphere or Clan Mechs, according to which side you are fighting for;- Mech movement animations/realism is worse than Mechwarrior 3/4 and MWLL;- Timeline is based off the start of clan invasions but technology is not consistent with that period and many important mechs are missing;- Weapons and heat don't obey normal Battletech rules;- Mech customization is very limited;- Mechlab sucks;- Out-of-match GUI (menus) sucks;- Mechlab sucks in every possible way;- Almost no maps require thermal vision to be used now, rendering it a near-useless mechanic;- Did I mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mechlab?It will also be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you're a purist, cos all of the gear, mech weapons and mech mechanics are 'tweaked' by the developers to stablish a meta that'll sell better.I play it and have loads of fun with friends from both real life and in-game, but so far have only three Cauldron Borns in my MechBays because when I started the game some people tricked me into playing Inner Sphere and I wasted all my begginer cred on useless Catapults, Locusts, Trebuchets.So, I do recommend this game but ONLY if you're ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with Battlemech Combat. Otherwise, it'll be too much pain to bear and you're better off playing the MWLL mod for Crisis Warhead or any of the old games or EVEN Mech Commander 2.			"

It is truly a Team Game, meaning that usually the team that communicates better most likely wins.The developers explain their plans with the community as well as answer questions from the community from time to time.The developers constantly run events during weekends and holidays that can net you extra mechs, ingame currency, and sometimes even Real money currency.The negatives.As a new player, the learning curve is very harsh. It will take some significant time to learn most of the nuances of the game.Additional Mech Bays cost Real currency (MC) which means after your first 4 free mech bays you will have to spend  MC to gain additional Mechs.The Community Warfare is a hollow shell of what it should be.  It is nothing more than Team Deathmatch to take over colored pixels which mean absolutley nothing. Hopefully this will be adressed in the future, but to this point it has not.These are my honest opinions of the game, if you like a "" shoot em up ""  mech game and are willing to spend time learning the game , like to work as part of a team, then this is probably the game for you.

												Pros:- Immersive Battlemech Combat;- Galaxy Map and Faction War with real dropships and planet capture/control;- Player Owned Mechwarrior Units both mercenary and loyalist;- Solo Carreer possible as freelancer, contracted mercenary and loyalist;- Good hearted community;Cons:- Takes forever to make money in-game and thus acquiring mechs/gear is a terrible grind (you'll have loads of fun right away if you have a few hundred $US to spend on it);- Quick match has long wait queues, tonnage enforcement and map/mode votation mechanics;- Faction matches are almost exclusively tactically focused - only very well organized units have access to strategic gameplay;- In Facion play, you are limited to either Inner Sphere or Clan Mechs, according to which side you are fighting for;- Mech movement animations/realism is worse than Mechwarrior 3/4 and MWLL;- Timeline is based off the start of clan invasions but technology is not consistent with that period and many important mechs are missing;- Weapons and heat don't obey normal Battletech rules;- Mech customization is very limited;- Mechlab sucks;- Out-of-match GUI (menus) sucks;- Mechlab sucks in every possible way;- Almost no maps require thermal vision to be used now, rendering it a near-useless mechanic;- Did I mention the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mechlab?It will also be a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you're a purist, cos all of the gear, mech weapons and mech mechanics are 'tweaked' by the developers to stablish a meta that'll sell better.I play it and have loads of fun with friends from both real life and in-game, but so far have only three Cauldron Borns in my MechBays because when I started the game some people tricked me into playing Inner Sphere and I wasted all my begginer cred on useless Catapults, Locusts, Trebuchets.So, I do recommend this game but ONLY if you're ABSOLUTELY IN LOVE with Battlemech Combat. Otherwise, it'll be too much pain to bear and you're better off playing the MWLL mod for Crisis Warhead or any of the old games or EVEN Mech Commander 2.			"

												I was an original founder back in Closed Beta.  I bought in because I loved the original PvE games and was looking forward to how this panned out.  I didn't end up playing long back then because the Meta-gaming was just terrible.  Stacked builds like Dual Guass Cats, and 170Kph Jenners that you could just not hit because of hitbox and shocking bad latency issues.  It was like old school shooters where you had to lead/guess half a second ahead of where your target COULD be.  Also it was very easy to lose funds in anything but a poorly equipped mech.  The fancy geared ones you just could not afford to run.  8 man teams coming into PuGs and just squashing Newbs wasn't good for keeping players interested either.April 2016.  I decided to revisit, and it's changed.  You now can run whatever you can afford to build as most of the cost is in the initial purchase, and Repair/Rearm costs seems significantly lowered.  Possibly removed entirely.  Hit detection seems a lot better now even on 300ms ping to NA server.  There is an Oceanic server which is great for me.  The Metagaming BS has been trashed.  There doesn't seem to be any 'cheese' builds anymore.  However the more expensive Clan mechs still seem way better than any equivalent Inner Sphere design, and there is some serious inconsistency between model size/stature and actual tonnage.  Now there is Faction based warfare and rewards, and altough I haven't tried it yet  it does look interesting.			"

												The latest PC game incarnation of the classic BattleTech simulator series, MechWarrior Online offers a unique gameplay experience for a nominal F2P shooter game, slower paced and more tactical.

												Pros:A free to play first-person shooter. Some 'Mechs are for real cash only, but after sometime (?) these become avialable for in game currency.This is a slow paced shooter (Think World of Tanks). You're in a big stompy robot, and movement illustrates this in game. Customization is abound for each 'Mech. Don't like what weapons you start out with?NO PROBLEM! You really get to tweak each 'Mech to your own playstayle. However, my one problem with the customization is the requirement to have 3 Chasis of the same 'Mech to level pilot skills, this can be kind of grindy.New players will be glad to know that you are injected with what I consider to be a large amount of in game currency for playing 25 matches as a new player. This injection will allow you to get a few 'Mechs and totally fit them out, which is great.Cons:The game can feel grindy at times, especially if you ""gotta catch'em all"" or are a completionist.Some 'Mechs are only availble at their release for real cash (gotta make money somehow, right?) As such, early adopters can be penalized for purchasing underperforming 'Mechs. Solution for you? Don't buy the new 'Mechs right away.Limited number of maps. There are less than 10 for quick play at the time of this review. Community Warefare has different maps, but that is an entirely different gamemode and for more experienced players.You can screw yourself up and buy bad 'Mechs with in game currency and then be stuck with these 'Mechs until you earn more in game money, do research before you buy 'Mechs is my suggestion.

												I've been playing this game since closed alpha -- I had to fill out an application and be accepted to join closed alpha testing. That was early 2012 and this is still by far my most played video game of all time. You need to know what you are getting into with this so that your expectations are not let down.There still is no single player campaignThere is no story lineCommunity warfare is just another game mode with virtually zero additional depthThere is a very steep learning curve. You will have to play for many hours before you are really good. There is a lot to learn, many quirks and intricacies.  If you like the gameplay, though, this game may be for you. There are many different strategies you can take -- various mech classes and roles. For me, the game never gets stale because of the customization and different roles. If I get tired of playing the peek-and-poke strategy with a fast, light, agile mech running 2 large pulse lasers, I can switch to an assault brawler build with short range missiles and a large autocannon and have a completely different play experience. So for me, the game never gets stale, I just keep coming back for more. So just know going into it that it's almost like a porno -- the plot is just some thin BS, it's really about the action. If you like the action enough, this game wont get old.			"

												I don't really feel like either IS or Clan have a considerable advantage in all the drops I've been on, they are just better at different things (I played this long before it came to steam, even before clans so ignore that playtime). Aside from MC only mechs (which usually end up being weaker than most variants due to hardpoints or quirks but give bonus c-bills/exp), and mechbays (which you can buy/win on events that happen every other week or so), everything can basically be bought with in-game currency. Get in a unit after a few games for advice/guidance (great ""Older community"" in this game ready to help), get a mech they recommend with the starter money you earn in your first few matches and have some fun in your very own laser vomiting stompy robot.

												Ah, MechWarrior. I think MWO is great for what it is. The graphics are pleasing and the various 'Mechs handle just like they should. The game doesn't ask for much with system specs either, most half decent potatoes can run this game at low with at least 30 frames. I've been a long time supporter for MWO and they've added a lot. Things like new game modes, 'Mechs, maps, modules, weapons, different physics, you name it. The game isn't pay to win either (like a lot of people say) more of pay to get your stuff faster because you're lazy type of game. The two main currencies in the game are the C-bills and MC. You earn C-bills how you would expect, playing matches and are rewarded with more if you did well and less if you didn't do well. You earn MC by paying real money for it (something like $14 or $15 for 1,500 MC). With C-bills, you can buy everything with except cosmetics (EX: Christmas lights for your cockpit and such). With MC, you can also buy everything, including cosmetics.If you're a long time MechWarrior fan, I would give it a try. But, if you arent, I would consider this:- 'Mechs handle like tanks do. Your mech will walk in the direction it's legs are pointing, not the direction you're looking.- 'Mechs are also multi-ton war machines the size of a building, they're slow and have a heavy feeling to them- MechWarrior is a slow paced game, you can't just run around the map getting kills left and right. It requires you to actually think before you do, and stratagize with your team. (No respawns during matches)For a guy like me, this game is awesome. It's great graphics and low specs means i can play it on my laptop when on the go, and it's multi-player based gameplay is perfect for fun matches with my friends. Addictive and action packed.8.5/10			"

												Probably the best entry of all the Mechwarrior games and mods. The graphics, the gameplay, and the community (except the asshats on facebook) are all top notch. Whether you're a Classic BattleTech fan, competitive player, casual shooter, or sim-nut, there's a place for you in MWO. There is a bit of a learning curve, though it is nothing like Eve Online. The best way I could describe it is that it is complex, difficult, but accessable. It is an all around enjoyable game with the variety and depth needed to satiate the needs of most niche-gamers, adrenaline junkies, and strategists alike.People who complain that it is pay to win are ♥♥♥♥ing morons. Everyone has access to the same mechs and and weapons. It's pay to look cool, or pay for the convenience of not having to grind for money to buy the next mech you want. It pays their bills (albeit barely), and keeps the game fair. I honestly could not think of a better f2p model.The game runs surprisingly well on dated computers; I ran it on an AMD athlon 2 x2 with a radeon hd 6670 for years without issue. Granted, it was on low settings DX9, but I could still play competitive and record with fraps. Now with an i5dk and radeon 380x, it easily runs maxed out DX11 at 90fps average, meaning that an 800$ computer today can run it maxed out in competitive play.My *only* complaint about the game is that it lacks some of my favorite mechs from the BattleTech/MechWarrior IP, like the Annihilator, Bushwacker, Champion, and the like, but that will change as the in game timeline progresses.

												If you are Familiar with Mechassault then you might like this game. MechWarrior online makes you feel like you're in your favorit mech, a steal battalion layout feel. It may be a little too advaced for your taste though. A real team players experience, if you stray from your team your going to get picked off. You get one live and your out, if your into that kind of layout then you'll be fine.I totally recommend giving it a try and hay, its Free to play! :D			"

												Been Playing this game since Closed Beta, and ive gotta say, the Devs have just been getting better and better.After some definitly shaky beginnings, they absolutely delivered on an excellent mech shooter.If you like big stompy robots blasting each other to pieces, then this game is for you! Very recetnly the grind was largely reduced, and even though there is a micro-transaction model in place, you can honestly never spend a dime on this game, and still have everything the next guy does. The devs put out enough weekend give-aways, and events to reward players with goodies, free mechs and premium time to mean you've got plenty of in game currency to buy what ever you need, wheter it be Mechs, Colours, items or Mechbays!

												As a kid, i was in a Battletech club after school that was ran by a couple teachers and the level of nostalgia this game brings back is uncanny.  I absolutely love this game.  It is NOT perfect.  I think the cost for real money items can be a bit high, when you're paying 30.00 real money and the currency you get in game doesn't yield you enough for more than 1 mech that seems excessive.  However, you can play the game without dropping a single dime and have a great time doing it.  I have only played quick matches because i'm still feeling the game out but I do absolutely think this is my personal favorite FPS style game.  Mech Customization is a bit fixed.  You can not put clan weaponry on inner sphere mechs and I find that to be a draw back but I think they're doing it because the game is set in 3051 which predates the 3055 sourcebook that was the introduction of Clan tech on innersphere mechs with the exctensive list of IIC mechs that came out such as the Rifleman IIC and so forth.  There are some clan versions of popular innersphere mechs and i feel the game is going to get better.			"

												This game has been around for a few years in development off of Steam and it's grown a lot in the last year or so. It does a really good job of portraying the extensive Battletech/Mechwarrior lore that's been developed over the last 25-30 years by FASA, Microsoft, and other gaming companies. The learning curve can be a little steep as it's a very team oriented game and going lone wolf usually won't turn out well against vetern players.There's plenty of good advice to be had on the games official forums where you can find tactics and Mech builds.

												This game is amazing. The combat gets my heart racing so fast. Exhilarating combat experiences await when you have a good team leader and team mates.However, if you are flying solo, it can turn into a complete slaughterfest very quickly and very often. This game needs to be played with a group of people who are willing to march as one coherent group.Then we have the game store. This completely kills it for me. if you have the money you can buy everything you want. No need to grind in-game credits when you can avoid it entirely with $20-50. This makes the grind a wall setup to impede free players.What my biggest gripe of all is there is no way to expand your mech capacity for free. You have to spend hundreds in order to collect these mechs. And collecting is fun! It's not fun selling your hard grind just to make room for another mech. This one shot the score down for me. I would be willing to forgive most of the shop, but not this one.Pros:Beautiful graphics.The world and the mech models are amazing.Amazing combat. This combat is action packed when it heats up and you can feal the heat! Some feel the fights are too slow paced. I however like it. Big hulking machines pounding each other as if there is no tomorrow.Completely team oriented. You need team work or you fall apart fast! This is kind of a con at the same time if you don't find a team to play with. You wont have as much fun if you solo queue.VOIP built in.It doesn't sound bad and mostly works well. Still recommend using your own VOIP with the team you play with. Communication is key in this game and this was well needed to be built in.Cons:Too few free mech slots.You end up having to buy additional space for your mechs with real money. If you dont have space for another, you have to sell it. That's terrible!MicroTransation store can purchase anything and has exclusives mechs.This store is completely anti-free player. It has the essential Mech garages (needed to increase mech slots), exclusive mechs and every mech available. There is nothing you can't buy with this store.No free way to obtain this pay currency on a regular basis.Needless Grind.The games grind is 100% setup to hold free players back. The store is a shortcut to buy your way out of it.Match Making.It will put you up against a complete pre-made. You will get slaughtered and you will get this often if you fight alone.Overall Rating:76/100PC Specs  Hardware Type   CPU Intel i7-3770k @ 4GHz   GPU EVGA Nvidia 680GTX   RAM 16GB DDR3 2133   OS Windows 10 Pro  "

												'This game is ACE'I downloaded MWO in late 2012 after looking to see if there had been any further releases to the Mechwarrior series, a game i loved so much as a kid . Now with well over a 1000 hours of gameplay can safely say MWO is an equal and perhaps perfect multiplayer advancement that can true test your skill as a mech pilot and battlefield commander. MWO will definatly give to a top gamming rush!When your trying to survive battling head to head as the last mech standing, most likely Piloting and assualt mech with half its side shredded off with your opponent equally damaged its hard not to feel some sort of adrenaline.Or if you manage to sprint across the map just avoiding enemy fire from crippling a leg in a nimble light mech and just manage to Capture the enemy base just as you 5 enemy mechs appearing from behind a hill start laying in to you.It might take some investment of time to reach your peak mech piloting ability but its definatly worth it.I highly advise joining a good Unit that uses VOIP such as teamspeak as this will take your gamming experience to the next level!see you on the battlefield.80C "

												There are Mechwarrior fans, and there are Battletech fans. If you are looking for a game that that is like Mechwarrior 4... this game is not that. You probably won't even like it. If you are fundamentally incapable of playing on an impromptu team... you will not like it. If you are not capable of ever adjusting tactics to new situations and the strengths/weaknesses of other random players... you will not like it. If you think of yourself as being an invincible Rambo who should, through your own sheer awesomeness and force of will, be able to carry a team single-handlely, or at least get a rush of endorphins at how super-duper-awesome you are (i.e. you throw a tantrum every time you are humbled)... you will absolutely hate this game. This game is not CounterStrike. This game is not Call of duty. This game is not a hum-dee-dum casual game like World of [Whatever]. This game is difficult. You will lose. A lot. You will play against people much better than you while on a team much worse than you. And that's tough, but life isn't fair. You want grittiness? That's it. You want challenge? That's it. You will grind. You must grind. And you will get batter for it. You will be frustrated sometimes. Good. That makes the next victory all the sweeter. And for all of those things I listed above, this game is totally awesome. There are plenty of whining people who give this game negative reviews. I strongly suggest you read them and evaluate if that sounds like the kind of stuff you would complain about. But if you see negative reviews about the ""poisonous"" community, consider that the reviewer is probably the griefer who hogs up the battle comms with that stuff during a match and how obnoxious that is. If you see a review complaining about the mere existence of ""support"" mechs... consider how that person must react to being on a team. If you see reviews that say ""X weapon is the best and Y weapon is the worst"", and especially when you see that from different people about literally every combination of weapons in the game, consider how knowledgable these people must actually be about the system they are complaining about. And ignore them all. Try the game. If you don't like it; well, it was free and you can come back here to complain. But, on the other hand... you might just find it to be the best damned real-time approach to BattleTech that has ever been realized.			"

												If your a fan of the original mechwarrior games than you will love MWO.  It has tons of customisable mechs and the combat is top notch.  Faction wars kind of sucks though and is bassicaly for hardcore players only unless you want to lose 9 out of 10 matches grouped up with ""steam noobs""  that are just playing the game for the first time....  My other complaint is how much the mechs cost, they are WAY overpriced and trying to grind c-bills for them takes a very long time unless you have no job, school or life.  My advice to you is do some research before spending your cadet bonus money on a mech you might not want later on and check out all the trial mechs (they change every now and then) to find a mech you like.  nothing feels worse than spending a whole ton of c-bills on a mech only to find out you dont like it.  they are adding new content all the time and if your patient you can get some decent mechs and items for free when challenges come up.

												A truly outstanding mech game. If you're looking for a simulation experience with tactical gameplay, solid cooperation in every match and a positive and friendly community then look no further. Given that there is very few mech/mecha type games out there of this calibre, luckily MWO really has nailed most of what you want. The maps are big and detailed. The mechs are very customisable. This is a simulation where skill is required - but forgiving enough for a novice. When you relay coordinates and see people actively respond it shows you the community understand teamwork. When you spend the time and effort tagging opponents and people thank you for it - it's worth it. You can play a ranged game, a stealth game or get amongst it and brawl. As a final bonus, there are paid elements but you can do everything in game and there is no pay to win - David can always beat Goliath!			"

I personally don't mind spending $5-$10 on a free game since it helps developement of the game. however if you want things like paint jobs or accessories or to buy mech flat out with cash it is so expensive it will make your wallet snap shut. it would cost you $30-$40 to buy a mech flat out with cash which is kinda stupidly expensive.Advise to new players,Int he beginning do the turorial it gives you ingame money also save all your turotrial money and your new cadet bonus money until you figure out what type of mech you want. You can have anything from light to medium, even heavy and assault classes. when you figure out a chassis that you like and your play style buy a mech and outfit it to what you want out of it. until then, again save your ingame money because it can be difficult to reaquire. ________________________________________________________________________________To the developers,the prices of your consumables and other items are what you would expect. However the cost of mechs are stupidly expenensive. making them $10-$15 would bring in more sales. since you have the softcores and the hardcores buying mechs instead of only the hard cores. Also the price of unlocked paint/camos/cockpit accessories is also extremely high.The MWO product is self is a great product, runs smooth even on an old computer or a high end new one, so you have a very wide player base in terms of pc budget. The graphicsa are nice, although it would be nice to see the pilot breath during boot up and shut downn modes for a little extra eye candy. also please make a setting for depth of field because the game can get kinda grainy when your sniping 1250m+ away.Innersphere/Clan mechsthe innesphere mechs are stupidly unbalanced to clan mechs and have a but ton of useful quirks while a clan mech may only receive a slight exp bonus at the end of a round. Clan mechs are suppost to be drastically more high tech in comparisson to innersphere mechs according to game lore. because of the advantage of innerphere with both mech costs and quirks the clan mechs are severely at a disadvantage. if the balance is not going to be fixed at least make clan mechs relatively the same cost as innerphere instead of them often being 50%-100% more expensive			"

												This game takes a lot to get into, but it is totally worth it. Mechwarrior is a shooter that doesn't reward reflexes rather than it rewards careful strategy and knowledge. Understanding the game is your key to winning, but unfortunately it can be a bit difficult to get into.There is lots of things to juggle and pay attention to at one time while you play. Heat, Armor, Ammo, Movement speed, Limb Strength, current torso direction, current leg direction, radar. Its a lot. When you first play it is a bewildering amount of information that confuses you and makes it hard for you to really know what you are doing. But once you get it, it becomes second nature. You find yourself calling out enemy locations while getting missile lockons, targetting air strikes, and keeping your heat/armor carefully managed. This is the game's strength. When you finally master the game you really feel like you are piloting a 100 ton battlemech. It feels good to fire autocannons and break the leg of an enemy mech and see him limp away in fear. It feels dire when you run as a light mech, dodging enemy fire and attempting to sabatoge the support units of the enemy team. Sure the game is complex as all get out, but that makes it all the more *real*. Nothing gives you such grim satisfaction as turning off your heat protection and blowing out your engine in order to suicide kill an enemy mech. Feeling the loud slam as Particle cannon tears off your left arm and you retaliate with your remaining right. Never before has any game but the Mechwarrior series made me feel like I'm actually driving something. You feel connected to your Atlas or Timber Wolf as you would your car or truck. They even made it to the point where you can hear your engine malfunctioning if you are on low health, and you can listen to the hissing of your failing heat sinks if they are destroyed.Make no mistake. This game is in beta. It still has a long way to go before it is perfect. There's also a lot of skill involved, and it isn't the kind of game that you can learn in just a few hours. But once you do, it is great fun and it is also free!So join me, and maybe I'll see you on the battlefield mechwarrior.			"

												TL;DR - Devs really care and want the game to be great. They listen to feedback and try to do what the community wants without ruining the game. Gotta use your noggin' to do well and think over your actions ingame to assure victory. Definitely a great game. Good devs are good. And nice. Except for Paul.Don't let my Steam hours dissuade you; I've been playing since Closed Beta. The developers listen to the community and love the game. Mose of the developers play it, and do almost daily streams of the game where they're either sponsoring an event and giving awards, or actively playing with the player base. PGI really does care.That aside, things were rough at the start, but as the game stands now it is a very well cared for rendition of Mechwarrior and Battletech. Sure there are things that are not canon, such as mech releases, some weapons, and quirks, but these are to overall influence the gameplay. Sometimes you have to go against canon the make the game fun. PGI knows this, and does it, but very carefully.There is a learning curve to the game, but honestly after 5 matches you should understand most of it, roughly. There are nuances to every weight class, mech, faction, weapon selection/loadout. The more thought you put into it, often times, the better you'll be at the game ergo the more fun you'll have. Nothing is more satisfying then making a killer loadout that absolutely shreds mechs, or making something that seems impossible but works. I'm looking at you, 7 ER PPC Black Knight >:l			"

												Primer: If you play this, finish the Mech Academy and your first 25 games to get your cadet bonus C-Bills, save those and play the freebie mechs until you find a frame to your liking then spend your money. Mechs can take a while to grind out if you're not stacking premium time or buying them outright. Just a PSA8/10Good:-Fun (no I mean that give that some thought)-Mech game-Quality Mechanics-Quick Play isn't terrible-VOIP (organize when in game and most people arent toxic from what I've seen)-Connection is consistent (i average around 80-130 ping in NA servers where i usually play, its higher than some games for me, compared to Overwatch where the highest i see regularly is 60-70 but its a different game and you don't notice. Take that from a guy who's played twitch shooters for nearly 20 years.)Bad:-Not ""Armored Core"" (playful joke for those who know)-Mech balance can be amazing to terrible depending on what just happened with the ""most recent patch"" www.metamechs.com for more on that.-Can soak up money like a sponge if you don't have good wallet control. (How many WoT premiums / time did you buy? yeah same thing here)-UI is a mess, but its useable if you trudge through it for a day or so. Its not terrible, just not great.-Has the same Meta shift most games like it do (again WoT) where whats good in one patch may be unuseable in the next or overpowered, the dice roll is real.-Faction Play has no point (if that's the entire reason you're here, just don't)*Extended commentary:If you're looking for a Mech game this is about the best one I've played on PC if you enjoy even the most remote idea of tactics and teamwork, granted you're going to have to talk to other people and go out of your way to co-ordinate with them both verbally and with mech selection (makes the game better IMO) so know that going in.You can solo que this up pretty good but the game shines when working with a team (of any number really 2 man squads all the way up to full 12's are fun when you can get them. The more people in each team that are organized the more fun the Quick play que is.Mechs have strengths and weaknesses which should be obvious based on class / weapon location / speed / armor etc:I'll say this as well MWO gets a lot of flack for PGI seeming to be a greedy company rolling out mech packs for sale / pre-order (just look over at MWOMercs.com for examples) and i'm sure that can be easily seen as such. However to be fair they do produce consistent products on a semi regular basis for those looking to get more new stuff and they do, all be it sometimes ham fistedly, try to take care of the game.*Faction play is not to be trusted, some enjoy it but I'm willing to bet they are a minority and it requires good teamwork and already having a decent stock of mechs in the garage, so it wont be where you start out. In conclusion I have fun with this game and play a lot of genres that sometimes don't treat me so well recently, MWO hasn't done that to me. I've purchased a mech that turned out to be bad, sure, but it's still fun to build and take into the Solo que with different weapons and configurations trying to make something work. Afterall thats how you improve as a builder and pilot.Not as boring as Chromehounds, not nearly as bleeding edge as Armored Core. MWO sits very comfortably in the middle as a tactical-esque arcade mech shooter that treats its players alright as long as they arent looking for hand outs.			"

												It's definitely pay2win but it's more forgiving than other f2p games cause you can have roles. It's okay to use a trial (good) mech and jump in with friends. And you can perform better than others in better mechs by playing your role and staying in a group.However, if you want to choose this game and be serious about it, I don't recommend it. It's a serious serious grind. Tons upon tons of items to buy. And the inventory/management has to be one of the most confusing I've ever seen. The only reason I can survive is cause my friend who has spent $1200 ingame manages stuff for me.There's 4 different kids of currency: C-bills, mech XP and general XP and MC. Yes it's that confusing. To use one you must convert another, which requires MC in order to convert as a conversion fee. Confusing as all hell. And all the mechs they release are just restated old mechs, and they charge like $40 per mech. In order to ""upgrade"" your mech/pilot trees, you must actually buy 2 other variants of that mech. This means a casual player like me who just wants to play one type of mech/playstyle is forced to buy other mechs to fully upgrade the mech I want to main. Again, it's another obvious f2p mechanic.If you can get past this, then it's a fun game. Has that CS:GO feel but u survive longer and thus can have more fun.			"

												I love Mechwarrior in general. Most of the games have been great, and it annoys me deeply that you can't get the earlier games very easily anymore. If they had earlier mechwarrior games on Steam, I'd likely own them all.Mechwarrior Online isn't quite the same. It's a player vs player game. Think World of Tanks, with Battle Mechs.  This is mostly a good thing.  The interface is a bit clunky, but the game seems to run well, and it looks pretty.  I've played this game for hundreds of hours before it hit Steam, right through the early Betas.There are many, many mechs to choose from, both clan and inner sphere designs, and a reasonable number of maps. The wait times are comfortably tolerable, and the match-maker's not too bad either.  Unfortunately, you have to vote on maps and game styles upon queuing up, and without fail the majority seems to choose the same damn maps... so while they have a good selection, in practice you don't get to play on all that many.Also, many of the mechs are behind a pay-wall. Not all by any means, but a lot of the really nice ones. It doesn't quite get to the level of Pay To Win, but it runs close. Patch after patch they bring out new monetisation in the form of new mechs, but not a lot of other content.  This can be deeply frustrating.Equipping your mech is fun. Lots of fun. There are a great deal of options available - though unlike many of the earlier Mechwarrior games you can't just throw what you like on your mech up to the wieght limit. Certain slots are limited to projectile weapons, or missiles, or energy weapons, etc.  I can understand why, but it does cut down on the configurability a bit. You can get different variants of the same basic mech, which does help mitigate this a bit.There are down-sides however, and a lot of that is to do with how the game has ultimately developed.Back in the earlier days, the matches felt a lot more epic. Mechs seemed slower and heavier, and each could take a real pounding. You could almost feel the tonnes of metal lurching around, being blown off, etc.  More recent updates seem to have put the emphasis on action. Everything is a lot faster than it was, and I think this is a shame.  You don't quite get that visceral *thump* of steel hitting steel anymore, and everything feels a bit more cartoony as a result.  Also, your mechs come apart a lot faster. There are no missions, it's all arena play. The arenas themselves are various sizes, but generally quite big, with lots of room to maneuver. However, unless you have your own ""platoon"", you'll find the random matches tend to involve people not really working together... which is a real shame.In short, it's not bad, but it's not great. If you don't want to send money on it, it's also free. Got to recommend it just for the big robots.			"

												If you play games like Warthunder *cough* terrible customer service *cough*, or games like World of Tanks *cough* too arcade-ish with harsh negative community *cough* you will fit right in with MWO.  First and foremost, the community in MWO is so great that they offer voice chat with your team unlike other games of similar play type.  MWO is all about skill and teamwork. There are some fantastic armchair field commanders in this game that lead your team to huge victories. Again with the community, I usually hate to play along side kids as they tend to screw around, but nearly every kid I have ever been teamed up with in this game takes it just as serious as the adult players.  There are constant contests that are reasonable to achieve and are not based on pure luck randomness like Warthunder wanting you to destroy 4 or more anti air vehicles in a single match at tier 3 or higher. Nor do these contests require you to have premium time to achieve like in World of tanks where you have a time limit in days to earn X amount of XP in a tank tree to ""win"" the event, and if you did the math on non premium time would take way too much time to ""win"" and may not even get it with constant play.

												I have been playing for a couple years now, and I gotta say, this has been my favorite game for most of that time.  It does take some time to learn the game and the play style (you can't play this game like Call of Duty) and to build a collection of useful mechs, but it has been extremely rewarding.I have found a variety of different playstyles that I enjoy, the mechs look great, the customization aspect has a learning curve (there are many guides available) but is very enjoyable.  There are some great teams to join too if you like playing with other people.I definitely recommend giving this game a try (it is free to play after all), just don't expect to drop in and figure it out in 20 minutes!  Also, try to take advantage of some of the guides that are available here on steam and on the official website of the game, it will help a alot!  There are many factors to consider, which is a lot for new players who are just trying to figure it out.			"

Again with the community, I usually hate to play along side kids as they tend to screw around, but nearly every kid I have ever been teamed up with in this game takes it just as serious as the adult players.  There are constant contests that are reasonable to achieve and are not based on pure luck randomness like Warthunder wanting you to destroy 4 or more anti air vehicles in a single match at tier 3 or higher. Nor do these contests require you to have premium time to achieve like in World of tanks where you have a time limit in days to earn X amount of XP in a tank tree to ""win"" the event, and if you did the math on non premium time would take way too much time to ""win"" and may not even get it with constant play.

												I love Mechwarrior in general. Most of the games have been great, and it annoys me deeply that you can't get the earlier games very easily anymore. If they had earlier mechwarrior games on Steam, I'd likely own them all.Mechwarrior Online isn't quite the same. It's a player vs player game. Think World of Tanks, with Battle Mechs.  This is mostly a good thing.  The interface is a bit clunky, but the game seems to run well, and it looks pretty.  I've played this game for hundreds of hours before it hit Steam, right through the early Betas.There are many, many mechs to choose from, both clan and inner sphere designs, and a reasonable number of maps. The wait times are comfortably tolerable, and the match-maker's not too bad either.  Unfortunately, you have to vote on maps and game styles upon queuing up, and without fail the majority seems to choose the same damn maps... so while they have a good selection, in practice you don't get to play on all that many.Also, many of the mechs are behind a pay-wall. Not all by any means, but a lot of the really nice ones. It doesn't quite get to the level of Pay To Win, but it runs close. Patch after patch they bring out new monetisation in the form of new mechs, but not a lot of other content.  This can be deeply frustrating.Equipping your mech is fun. Lots of fun. There are a great deal of options available - though unlike many of the earlier Mechwarrior games you can't just throw what you like on your mech up to the wieght limit. Certain slots are limited to projectile weapons, or missiles, or energy weapons, etc.  I can understand why, but it does cut down on the configurability a bit. You can get different variants of the same basic mech, which does help mitigate this a bit.There are down-sides however, and a lot of that is to do with how the game has ultimately developed.Back in the earlier days, the matches felt a lot more epic. Mechs seemed slower and heavier, and each could take a real pounding. You could almost feel the tonnes of metal lurching around, being blown off, etc.  More recent updates seem to have put the emphasis on action. Everything is a lot faster than it was, and I think this is a shame.  You don't quite get that visceral *thump* of steel hitting steel anymore, and everything feels a bit more cartoony as a result.  Also, your mechs come apart a lot faster. There are no missions, it's all arena play. The arenas themselves are various sizes, but generally quite big, with lots of room to maneuver. However, unless you have your own ""platoon"", you'll find the random matches tend to involve people not really working together... which is a real shame.In short, it's not bad, but it's not great. If you don't want to send money on it, it's also free. Got to recommend it just for the big robots.			"

												Overall a very good game. Like most games these days, using real money can get you some advantages early rather than waiting for your points to build up. Mech's have poor resale value so chosing the wrong one can cost your hard earned points. Take advantage of the trial Mechs to see what your game play style is. Hit and run? Duke it out on the front line? Guard the flanks? Long range or close in combat? I'm slowly getting better but I suspect that just like race car, becoming good at this takes seat time and the machine is likely more capable than I am.			"

												An oldie title, but a goodie, I remember jumping into the game simulaters at the local Dave and Busters. It's about the same.   With 100s of mechs to choose from, 100s equipment to choose from, 100s mods and skill points to choose from.....With a quick tuturial with Capt. Adams and some time in the MechWarrior Acadamy, learn how to do the basics in your Mech, and become a MechWarrior of the 31 millinium. SCIFI and future battles involving mercenaries, freelancers and houses of MechWarriors battleing out as ''norm'' at the time for supremecy of the Inner Sphere. So choose between a Light, Medium, Heavy and Assualt Mech. Each Mech does have a specific playing style according to their size...AKA how many weapons they can blast you with . The bigger the more weapons/sensors/armor. Level up your Mech by playing it more to get skills and level your pilot skills up by just playing any Mechs. Skills give slight edges in battle with range, cooldowns and sensor perks. Nothing beats tactics in this game though. You will die alone. The learning curve is steep. VERY. So after chooseing a Mech , choose to be a mercenary or freelancer or join up with a house to combat together for the highest rewards. Matches are usual capture points or hold points or just kill them all with lots of weapons. Your mech you can custamize with specific skins and cockpit goodies or straight up pay money for the best of the best. Yes, pay to win does help here to the grinder free to play MechWarriors. Custamizing your Mechs armor and weapons and skills load out is VERY much up to you. Lasers? Flamethrower? Pulse-Lasers? All, is up to you, but you have to watch how much you can equip ,that depends on your Mechs tonage. The size does matter, again the bigger = more tonage = the more weapons. Lots of acheivments and titles/badges to show off and joining a unit or friends group is strongly suggested for fun, tactics and rewards. Or just hide behind the bigger Mechs and pot shot into a fight that surely your going to win and stay alive.'' I played the Myst Lynx Light Mech''...			"

												The game is absolutely horrible. You drive a big stompy mech and shootz people in the eyes with lazors and rain on them with the missiles. You have to use this thing called teamwork and even talk to people once in awhile to tell your team enemy locations or let thim know that they are pushing hard on a specific flank. Itz so hard and lik the legs don't move in de same direction as your face sometimes and it's all confuzabibble. And there is this magical button that you press, has this thing, oh, here it is..the R button, lets you lock on to a mech and it lets you know where you should shoot. This gaem is soo ard and so long that at the end of the day...you sleep and dream, of the big stompy mechs.But on the serious note, It is a very fun game if you can actually leave your shell and communicate with your team. Do yourself  a favor and before dropping money buying all of the mechs in the game(which is alot), buy a damn mic. That thur adds at least 100 more damage to your ending score. Do not start out and spend your c-bills on the first mech you see in the store, use the trial mechs, they are decent builds, I have pulled top damage many times using them, so use them and get a feel for the type of mech you enjoy playing. And it isn't always about the size of your mech, in this game, it is how you use it. I personally like the graphics and the game as of right now, feels pretty balanced. Game had a wonky past, but things have been getting alot better and the company has made leaps and bounds in the right direction in my opinion...which is why you are reading this review. Game is free, and worth every penny! Disclaimer: I played this game before it hit steam, so I have a hell of alot more hours than it shows on here.			"

												(Been playing since a year before Steam's release)The slow team-based combat of Counter Strike meets pinpoint bodypart damage and thousands of possible personal builds. There's no levelling up or Killstreak bonuses or anything like that. You simply get money at the end of each match that can be used to buy a new mech or continue customizing one for maximum speed, damage output, or versatility.			"

												Spent over 250 hours on this game outside of steam alone. Great F2P game and definitely not pay to win. Player skills and mech load outs are decisive factors in winning. Clan warefare is brutal for newcommers but still playable. All mechs are free, newer ones will be made available in 3-5 months lead times f you have the patience but at the moment there are more than enough mechs to experiment. Earning c-bills is a bit grindy but weekend event prizes and premium times awards will give you the surge in earnings. Highly recommend this game if youre' into giant robot battling it out.8.5/10**Update**Total hours spent is now closer to 500 hrs (Steam + non Steam) and I am changing to a non-recommendation. The only decent game mode is Skirmish, forget about Clan Warfare as it is horribly unbalanced after the introduction of Long Tom. The faction with LT will get a guaranteed win, its that simple. Since this game's introcution to Steam, the player base have been steadiliy declining, for good reason. Scout mode which is played for gathering Intel leads to obtaining the LT, but in this mode its pretty much 4xGriffins with ECM vs Stormcrows with traking streak missles.This game is no longer chanllenging and fun, just a lot of frustration at the point of writing this review.

No need to know this game to learn it and love it, but can expect some diehard fans, that only play this game, but the community is mostly friendly if maybe a bit stoic but thats been my experience so far. cheers			"

												I have been playing MWO for a while now. It is still one of my favorite games. Always new mechs and Events and it never gets boring. If you are a mechwarrior fan. This is a must. Great Game and plays very smoothe. Definiately give it a shot.			"

												Best Mechwarrior Game so far besides of free2play mechanics. Good used Cry engine and good animated mech models. May be the game is nothing for casuals because of complex game mechanics like optimisation of the armor, weapons and mobility but if you got it once you will understand the rest easily.          "

												This is a great game if you remember one thing. Community Warfare isn't the place to go to learn how to play. It's the equivalent of end game content. It's MWO's version of open world PvP. That said, there is no pay to win. Yes there are a few Mech variants that are cash only, but note the word ""variant"". They're different versions of regular mechs, and aren't more powerful, don't have special abilities etc. Often based on characters from the BattleTech universe, they have a different hardpoints (determines where and how many weapons of a given type can be mounted).  As I said, it's not pay to win, so it isn't a matter of adding more. Various factors such as space and weight limits apply. Sometimes its a Mech that is mostly Ballistics based (ie ""guns"") and the Hero version mostly Energy (lasers etc) based. Toss in a unique camouflage scheme, some colors, and that's one way they keep the lights on. New mechs are introduced regularly, and spend a few months as cash only, then opened up for in-game money. No the new ones aren't more powerful etc. Weight and space limits remember? An AC/20 still weighs 14 tons no matter what Mech you pilot.It's a fun game, if you're willing to admit there is a learning curve. LRMs (Long Range Missiles) are deadly until you learn how to avoid them. as a common example. The official forums have a very active new player section, and the community is overwhelmingly friendly and helpful. I've spent over $100 on this game and I don't spend money on F2P games. One big purchase early on for some mechs, then bought some additional mech bays (this was in the days before you could earn free ones in CW and special events.)  The only way to ""screw up"" is to spend your Cadet bonus unwisely (you get bonus cash your first 25 missions to help you along). Even then you can pilot ""trial"" mechs for variety as you save up to buy new mechs. Bottom line? Visit the official forums and read over the New Player section while you download MWO. Ask questions, don't be a jerk, and you'll have lots of fun. :)			"

												   TLDR: This game is not newbie friendly, it's shallow and has pretty repeative gameplay, the Devs are as greedy as EA, Content comes out at a glacial pace and in small quantites for very high prices ( 4 mechs for 60+ USD) And it's only really fun to play in a player clan because if you go lone wolf and play random battles you'll get bored fast.So, I've been a Mechwarrior fan since i was 5 playing Mechwarrior 2 Mercs on Windows 95 and i've played every Mechwarrior since and this game is probably my least favorite and  the most shallow It's hard to keep playing at a consistant pace. It kinda a bit in common with Battlefront and the developer is almost as greedy as EA. Great graphics with zero depth. it even has it's own version of EA style DLC  , you see, every time they add a new mechpack (at a glacial pace) they are first sold for real currency (for the price of a triple A game mind you 60+ USD) , then in game premium currency then you can finally buy it with regular credits after half a year.) this game is lucky it's the only Mechwarrior sim at the moment and they're squeezing us for every penny. Queue times are long for random battles and MM sometimes has a brainfart and gives one team a significant tonnage advantage. there also aren't many maps and the level of content you get for your money is very low. Playing random battles can be confusing for new players and can get stale fast , the tutorial only covers the very basics and the game has a steep learning curve so new players will not know how to make the best builds and will get outgunned by players running metabuilds. the only thing that keeps me playing is Community Warfare which is a competative mode where player clans join factions from the lore and fight against each other for planets and ultimately control of the Inner Sphere.  to sum this up i would not say this is a good game, with about 3 years of being online the amount this game developed is pretty pathetic especially when you see what kind of prices they charge for content. I'd only recommend this game if you're a diehard fan who can join a clan and i would urge you to seriously consider if you want to shell out the price of a triple A game for a couple of mechs.			"

												The core gameplay is sort of a mix between a Tank game and a Shooter. The game is slower paced than a number of other shooters, but this does not mean that it is easier. In fact, the learning curve for a brand new player can be relatively steep. The gameplay itself can be deep and rewarding though, which keeps many players playing despite the other issues they have with the game.For one thing, the game is very much a team-dependant game closer to a MoBA than a typical FPS in that regard. With no respawns (or limited respawns in faction warfare) it s essential for players to stay and fight cohesively. Players that run off attempting to grab kills for themselves can be quickly focused down by many other mechs and accomplish very ittle.The game features pretty in-depth customization of mechs that goes beyond just switching out weapons. You are able to adjust armor, change engines, replace parts, and add and remove weapons and equipment depending on the sometimes complex Mechlab rules. When you start you will be using a Trial mech at first, but you gain in-game currency fast enough to be able to buy your own custom mech within a few hours at most.There is also no tier system in regards to the mechs. There is no unlocking of better mech chassis as you play. The choice for what you want to buy is open to you from the start.Despite the sometimes high real-world prices of items in the game and the fact that it is F2P, the game does a very good job of not being Pay to Win. All of the best mechs (determined by the community) in the game are either available for in-game currency or are timed exclusives for those who buy them (the closest thing to P2W that the game has). There are Hero mechs that are available for purchase only but they tend to not be good, but rather unique. Paid consumables are 100% identical to in-game currency consumables once the in-game currency consumables are upgraded with XP. The most useful things in the game available for real-money purchase are mech bays to store more mechs in, but they are given out in Faction Play and in relatively frequent events.There are certainly some hiccups with the game. It is not particularly well-optimized and the developers have not always consistently been on top of things. Some actions have generated quite a bit of animosity among past players. They have been getting better about it though and in my impression few of the issues come from anything approaching malice but rather from inexperience. They are at least still actively working on and adding to the game in significant ways (although maybe slower than many like).In the end though I find the game quite fun which has kept me coming back to it.I've played this game for quite some time before it was released on Steam (you should be able to look up Krivvan if you doubt that for whatever reason).

Posted: December 15, 2015
Of Mice, 'Mechs, and Star Lords: Threads of AmbitionOnce upon a time in the late 20th Century, in an era of vintage classics, the great Lords of Gaming bestowed upon their subjects a series called MechWarrior. Those were good times indeed.In those days I had happened upon a copy of MechWarrior 2, after being an obsessive fan of sci-fi simulation games like X-Wing, and strapped in to my first Mech Simulator and powered up - ""All Systems Nominal."" Everything got better from there that is until the Golden Century of Gaming had ended and the Great League of Publishers fell into dissarray (or were destroyed by the Word of EA and Microsoft).After a decade or so of players keeping MW alive, with the franchise having fallen into the dusbtin of history, and MW5 being destroyed by the evil of publishers a kickstarter-like (but not really a kickstarter) declared MW was back in 2012, and with promises that it would be ""awesome.""Was it in fact awesome? Let's see.The Space Lords of ""Freemium"" - Latin for Not ReallyAs most people may be aware, the first games in this unique series were made with a quality standard for premium type games. However, MW had been reborn, as a Freemium in 2012, made by developer Piranha known for classic games like Duke Nukem Forever Multiplayer and Bass Fish Gaming? Where is Jordan Weisman? No clue. The Nostalgia Was Strong and I threw my money into the 5 million dollar pile and be a glorified Beta Tester for 2 years.For those that know me, I have a love-hate relationship and low tolerance for plenty of OTHER F2P type games and approached this game with trepidation. I gave it my best shot. A series, once based on the old BattleTech franchise, and doing the bidding of Space Lords from your Cockpit with detailed, branching Single-Player with an addictive, bonus Multiplayer - became this. I'll get to that at the end, but firstly what to expect out of this review:  My honest take on the game and what you can expect, either as someone brand new to this series or those who were aware of the original franchise.The Basics - Is this the review now?You shoot at Walking Tanks with an assortment of space magic weapons like lasers, huge ballistic cannons, and missilesYou move around a battlefield to destroy the other team's Mechs, earning in-game currency to buy more Mechs, parts, or modulesYou can tinker with a Mech and experiment with different designs, not unlike previous games, but problems arise (weapons, how fast you move, armor levels, etc.) + base/weapon stats can be upgraded via modules and 'pilot tree' (recommended)Mechs are layered into pieces that you can shoot off individually (if the enemy has a laser in their right arm, you can shoot off that arm)'Twitch' based shooter that plays well enough with the keyboard/mouse, joystick, or a combinationMatched against random Robots with (when it works) similar skill in 'Solo' on random mapsThere is no story, only LARPingIf you want all the Robots prepare to hunker down for many days at a time, perhaps months, otherwise you can follow the whispers of PGI to open up your wallet (kind of like zealot ComStar hoarders)A tutorial is available, but there is somewhat of a learning curve if you are not used to quasi-simulations like MWDetractorsPricing - this isn't like MechWarrior you may have remembered paying 60 bucks for and being able to pilot hundreds of Mechs to your hearts content.Time commitment - if you don't have a lot of time to play games like me like an hour or two a day here and there, advancing in-game will feel like it takes ages, which will then make you feel like you need to spend cash as you fall behind everyone else and the vicious cycle repeatsGame still has optimization issues - I can run Witcher 3 on Ultra, but this game hiccups quite a bit for me; there are also default eye-sores like film-grain and reduced/smudgy view distance (some of these things can be turned off in the menu, some can not and require editing of config files outside the game)Wasted Potential: Or why I'm not recommending thisLack of unique or challenging Game Modes from previous games such as: Stock Mode, King of The Hill, Convoy, Co-op Missions, Terrain Control (true Conquest), or a better objective-based, etc.Customization while fun to a point in this game has its own inherent problems coupled with lack of cohesion with certain mechanics, which has caused imbalances that PGI will never be able to resolve truly in a Random Matchmaker. Balance in the previous games was better handled by Admins, Lobby or bidding systems, and generally the players themselves. In both BT and MW, players decided how and what level of customization was allowed.Lack of true variety; here Mechs at the top are sporting similar builds meant to kill an opponent as quickly as possible, with similar speeds and weapons, truckloads of endless ammo, and the only difference is how they look for nostalgia purposes. (BT and previous games have more variety with setup/rules)No innovation from holdover issues of old MW games using 'pin-point' damage in Multiplay (just go for the center torso, its all that matters and its easy to do)The pilot trees are the same for every Mech, so if you're looking for some depth and nuance to it there is noneYour first Mech includes a default build, these are canon builds from the original Battletech that are meant to be used/balanced against other similarly non-customized Mechs, BUT you will never actually be matched 100% against an entire team of non-custom and rather forced into the cauldron of Super Nascars.No ability to save your loadout into an in-game list for easy switching back and forthThe UI is clunky, laggy, and less intuitive compared to games a decade old, seriouslyLack of robust Multiplayer features on how you wish to play (no choosing of a specific map, match length preference, kill limits, whether you want sim aspects on or off such as spawning or third person, or you want to join a 2v2 4v4 8v8, IS vs IS, Clan vs Clan, etc.)Interesting tactical depth and sim-like aspects from past games are non-existent: Active/Passive radar, Jettison Ammo, Rear/Side internal cameras, true uncoupled free roam aim, and more - replaced by more ArcadeMaps are smallish, usually laned or nonsensically built; the largest maps have tons of unused space.Community Warfare is somehow worse than the better MW MMO from the late 90sThe 'custom' servers actually require you to pay real cash to fully utilize unlike most other f2p games, and over all is unintuitive (its not like a custom DOTA2 lobby for instance)The grind, for people like me who really don't have time for f2ps, was ultimately frustrating to no end; in previous games I loved using and trying EVERY Mech in the game but it takes too much time and/or money in this game.Summary: The Milking of Resurrected AmbitionsThe game overall left me simply wanting MORE out of it. Sort of 'ok' for a time until it set in how much it lacks in true content, depth, and a boatload of features compared with even the tacked on Multiplayer of previous games alone, let alone SP. If you DO play various F2Ps, you may tolerate it if you're not concerned about what all was in the previous games, but if you're like me where certain F2Ps just rub you wrong way with aggressive grinds and pay2notgrind nonsense or want a TRUE MechWarrior5, this just doesn't cut it. Frankly it saddens me that THIS is all that's left of the rich MW series. This is it? A shallow husk that feels 'average.'  It would be great if someone just makes MW5, but frankly perhaps MechWarrior should just be drug out back and buried.  All in all the type of f2p design decisions in this game holds it back from being truly great.			"

												Played this for about a year and a half before the glaring issues eventually forced myself and my friends to quit. To start expect a heavy pay to win experience or at best a pay to not grind three weeks for a standard mech. Also expect to be charged ridiculous amounts of cash to obtain hero mechs or even just mechbays or colors/patterns. Seriously it's in the neighborhood of $30+ PER MECH. Don't even think about the bundles and such as you'll get very little for $100+. Just standard mechs you can buy in game a little faster and MAYBE a bonus mech with a slight cbill boost.Once you get into the game expect two things. Fun stompy mech action and complete and utter bs metabuilds. In my time it went from LRMs for a brief period to PPC/Gauss builds. The PPC/Gauss was the worst because it was instant pinpoint HIGH damage. You'd wait 5-10 minutes for a match and die in seconds if you weren't in a light or assault class. Unless you got lucky matchmaking wise and the other team wasn't loaded with 5-6 metabuilds and you'd get a decent match. After the forced mech setup for matchmaking requiring x of each class it got a little more even in matches but the wait times went skyhigh. Eventually the high alpha BS and long wait times drove myself and my friends to stop playing.The company also has issues. One of the WORST I've ever dealt with. I understand Niko left a bit ago but still damn. They also can't balance their way out of a paper bag. Things get buffed WAY too far or not remotely enough and stay that way for months if not years. It took them six months or so to even start to nerf the high alpha metagame and even then it was weak nerfs that did very little curb it. Not even the bizarre ghost heat changes ever successfully killed it. The highest alpha to a side torso or center torso is the only real way to fight with any real success.I will admit before the issues started piling up and things with the company got worse it was a blast. It really captures the stompy mech action quite well. However the magic is long gone so if you play do it without wasting money like I did. Get in, do a couple rounds for some fun, and get out when the lopsided matches get to be too much. The trial/standard mechs work well enough for light play. As long as you don't invest too much time or money it's a perfectly fine game to play a match or two on occassion.EDIT - It seems they fixed up the wait times at some point. So it's faster to get into a game. The rest still stands.			"

												Its a decent stompy robot game, but its got alot of problems.  the biggest is the low turnaround to fixing issues with the game.  Weapon balance has been outta whack for some time with some weapons being unusable for years.  There is generally only one major ""balance pass"" a year rather than iterative changes, so if the weapon is useless after the pass its probably gonna be that way for a year or more.  It dosent help things when it seems that half the balance is made with dice rolls.The new mechlab came out 1.5 years ago and was total crap, it took them over a year to get it decently useful (at least better than the old one) and there are still features that the community wants put in, like a way to strip all the modules off all your mechs, that have been basically ignored.There are issues with map and gamemode design.  For gamemodes, the problem is that theres only 3 modes, and most of the time theres no real difference between the 3 of them.  Map design has a tendency to funnel everyone to the same spots every game, due to a combo of defensive terrain in select areas and both teams starting spread out rather than togeather.  By the time you grouped with ur team you are under attack or about to be.  This makes most maps seem very small and cramped no matter how large they are because ur fighting in the same small defensive areas.The time to kill (TTK) is very low as well.  There has been alot of power creep in this game to the point where a game which involves huge stompy mechs of doom that are supposed to dominate the battlefield instead plays more like COD with mechs hunkering down behind cover and popping out to fire and duck back in.  The TTK has been shinking for years  with no end or solution in sight.There is a part of the game called ""Community Warfare"" (or CW) which allows you to pick one of 10 factions and fight each other for control of the galaxy.  In reality the population is too low and most of the time its the Innsershere vs the Clans which gets real old after awhile.  In addition the issues with map design and gamemodes are even worse in CW, to the point where its alot like playing a tower defence game (not even joking)To top it all off while the game is free to play pretty much any ingame items are incredably overpriced, just look at the ""Steam performace packs"".  The grind is real so be prepared to either shell out alot of cash or time to get a decent mech.			"

												Yeah MWO A BattleTech game! MWO has nothing to do with BattleTech. Mechs! Who? Mech variants = 0. Buy your Robot Suit and put 10 identical weapons in your suit. And hold your LeftMouseButton. Now your are a Hero with skill. Better buy a Clan Super Mech and join to a Clan Hero Unit. And you can now grind the ♥♥♥♥ing Noobs in their ♥♥♥♥ing IS Mechs. After the Battle on the Small Arena Arcade Maps ends in maybe 2-5 minutes. Now go in MWO Forum and able to tell the victim how to MWO play from the perspective of a winner. After the first Clan Mechs coming out and the most of the Community MechJockeys on the IS side lost only the Battles versus Clan Mechs. Maybe only 80% join the Clan winner Side. And now the same Arrogants MWO Forum ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s want you teaching how you drive your Robot. But yes Cannon Fodder are quietly Welcome in the Game. Since 2012 is MWO Alive and Who's The Big Content More Maps and another BattleTech Stuff. Old bugs, FPS Drops,♥♥♥♥♥♥AMD performence and another negative things. And the CW mode Big Clan vs. IS Warfare is a Biggest Joke in MWO. Galaxy Map + few Boring Maps with one target. A Big Flak Cannon. Thats all. Who is the live in this universe. If you want to play a short simple Shooter. Play Moorhuhn ... Sry for my bad English but it's enough for this Bad Game.Not recommended for BattleTech & MechWarrior Fans. Only for Fast Arcade Robot Gaming Fans!gg close & have Fun with MWO Balance ;D			"

												The 91% approval rating on this game is proposterous.This is a game with no redeeming qualities, this is coming from someone who has spent hundreds of dollars on this game over the course of years, hoping, and praying it would become what PGI promised it would, I have played this game much longer than 45 hours.  It is an atrochious game relative to the standards it set for itself all those years ago on that kickstarter, and it is atrochious relative to the standards of game design.MWO is a ♥♥♥♥♥ier World of Tanks, that is it.  The 20-100 ton mechs handle like you are playing call of duty, the balance is apalling and made worse each time the developers touch it.  There are many mechs that are outright useless, and you have no way of knowing that till you grind for them, and find out firsthand.  Did I mention it is a grindfest?  Unless you're willing to pay a monthly stipend of course, even then it's still pretty bad.  Worst of all it runs like absolute dog♥♥♥♥♥♥  I have a $1500 that cant run it above 30FPS in most situations (This is after they removed Inverse Kinematics, Ammo Explosions, and several other basic features.) And this is AFTER I'd been able to run it at 60+ fps for years on a worse computer!If there is one thing I must tell you in this review, it is that the developers;DONOTCAREThey have never cared, they do not care the optomize their game, they do not care to balance it, they do not care to add any new weapons. (They have maybe 10 types of weapons in the game, in the battletech franchise, and older MW games, there are exponetialy more.)  You must pay 20-80 USD for new mechs when they are released as well, often times these mechs are broken, as they are nostalgia cash grabs that don't have the weapons, or equipment needed from the rest of the lore to function.  They have relased mechs that are based around single weapons, or strategies, that in NO WAY fits into this game, and charged up to 80 USD for them. MWO has been mired in a♥♥♥♥♥♥show of controversy and consumer♥♥♥♥♥♥ they have done nothing but make the game ACTUALLY worse as time has progressed, remaking maps that the community loved, and churning out garbage that runs worse than anyone could have imagined.  With all this money they have milked they have done nothing to devolope this game, or fix their mistakes.SUMMARY:  I have always hated PGI for making the first terrible title of an absolutley amazing series, but I played the game for years, because it was better than nothing.  I even liked the game if I could look at it as a non-Mechwarrior game.  But in the last year, the game has become nearly unplayable for me, between worsening UI, degrading visuals (Which is all this game had a leg to stand on in the first place) And a crippling framerate, I can no long say this game is even worth the time it takes to download, let alone the time it takes to grind a mech bigger than a Raven.  P.S. Lights are almost unplayable given the lag, and the massive nerfs by making them bigger than some ♥♥♥♥ing HEAVY mechs. That and they added ♥♥♥♥ing CS:GO style crates, crates that are absurdly lazey, no UI changes, just click a button and get an abhorent item or consumable.Edit: Removed an uncessary spur of the moment insult to people who liked it.  Sorry about that.			"

												TLDR:  Don't get burned like I did.  PGI is a dishonest, inept developer that drove away many who bought into the Founders Program.  They *consistently* overpromise and under-deliver.  The game, as it exists, still does not have what was promised to Founders at launch two years ago.  This is a minimum viable product that continues to have little depth, is poorly balanced and is only a shell of what a game worthy of the ""Mechwarrior"" title means if you know the IP.  By all means, play it for what it is, but don't give PGI money.  Let the game die so that another company can get the IP and do it right.If this game had just been released in the state it is in and you only intend to play it for free, I could recommend it as a fun stompy robot arena shooter, but the history and the company that made this game matter if you consider putting money into it.  When viewed through that lens...don't spend your money.  I started in closed beta and spent a good bit of money on this game before I realized PGI could not be trusted and would outright lie to the player base.  I still play now just because I love the IP and this is all we have right now, but I won't put another thin dime in PGI's pocket.Many have already pointed out many things that PGI got wrong and continues to get wrong in other reviews.  I won't belabor all of those here.  My key points:1.  Lied to Founders about ECM implementation, Third Person View, Ghost Heat, and consumables.  To give you an idea of how PGI treats its players, PGI banned players on their own forums for things people posted on reddit.  Really.2.  All items are overpriced in real money and it is a pretty steep grind for a F2P.3.  Player balance system is better, but still broken.  One-sided matches way too common.  This is because there is a small player base.4.  Game has no depth...just different arena battles.  Clan and IS mechs on same side in single player que is a clear example to anyone who knows the MW IP.5.  Wait times for games can be long due to small player base.5.  CW is NOT what you think it is.  It is a shallow layer on top of the shallow arena combat game with stompy robots.6.  Expect balance to swing wildly with each patch.7.  Don't expect first time quality from anything PGI promises. I will say the game looks and sounds pretty good (although infuriatingly, 100 ton mechs still get caught by small rocks on maps)...so it can be fun.  I stopped playing for two years and the progress made was only incremental when I came back.  I came back simply because MWO is the only MW game in town and I figured I should get my money's worth.  Did I mention you should play it for free, but don't pay PGI anything? ;)If you want to read about some of PGI's missteps...start here:http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/12/15/free-to-play-mechwarrior-online-offends-players-with-500-golden-mechs/http://www.pcgamer.com/piranha-games-speaks-out-on-transverse-crowdfunding-and-the-future-of-mechwarrior-online/  - check the comments on this one.http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/mechwarrior-online   - Peruse some of the user reviews...https://www.themittani.com/features/mwo-failure-communicatehttps://www.themittani.com/features/mwo-pgi-community-manager-ignites-reddit-controversyI realize the last two are goon site posts (and i do NOT endorse goons...but those articles are the truth) "

												This game was truly something special early on in the beta.  Some pretty terrible design choices were made and now even the UI is neeedlessly overcomplicated and dumb.  It's too bad, the franchise deserved something great.			"

												Started playing about a month ago.  Enjoyed the previous games and books.  This games really lacks any sense of balance and more often than not your going to get your but kicked, badly.  Don't play the community warfare (faction) battles unless you spent alot of money on upgrades.  Real money, not the in game stuff.  Basically, if you plan to spend money on the game you may really enjoy it.			"

												Not just ""giant stompy robots""   Battlemechs are basically walking tanks and half the game is in the Mechlab modifying and figuring out the best build/setup for a machine that matches your play-style.   Jumping into the cockpit and running around shooting is only a piece of the game... you must work with the team to win.  Free to Play but NOT pay to win in my humble opinion.			"

												I have 240 hours in this game out of steam and been playing for 3 years. I've spent over 200 dollars on this game as well. Too many overpriced packs to buy and not enough incentive to run different mechs other than aesthics. I have had fun, but there is too much advantage in sinking real money into this game for it to be anything but pay to win. The game is designed around taking advantage of people who love battletech to buy insanely expensive mech packs. Everything in this game is a super grind or a ploy to get more money from you.			"

Also promotes a boring blob mechanic where everyone huddles together and ♥♥♥♥♥ themselves until someone on the other team makes a mistake.Constantly changing purchased mechs by nerfing them 30-40% a few months after they sell them.

												My experience with this game over the last three years has been akin to watching a car crash in slow motion. At first you see a pristine, great concept, and original design, then gradtually watch in horror as it is torn to crumpled shreds by the oaf at the wheel, reducing it to a mangled ruin bereft of any former glory.This is not a good game for many reasons, the first being that the developers have burned every bridge imaginable. PGI is infmaous for throwing community managers under the proverbial bus to shirk responsibility for unpopular additions, censorship is rampant on their forums, the community is ignored or shunned at every turn, players are repeatedly outright lied to by the developers and balance is a joke. Over the years we have seen massive knee jerk reactions over and over again by the PGI, going for the quick and easy solutions to problems over retaining actual balance. This resulted in nightmares like the Jenner being an unstoppable god-slaying machine for the early months of the closed beta. With every new patch there was some new horror which stripped away at the game’s integrity, from the disastrous implementation of ECM and the poor handling of ghost heat, to the mishandled inclusion clan mechs and the developer’s sheer inability to pay even the vaguest hint of attention to BattleTech lore.If you want a good tactical combat game in this style, look into World of Tanks or War Thunder. Sure, they might not have big stomping mechs, but they're well-rounded in terms of balance and have a developer who sees their game as a product rather than a glorified premium milking machine.			"

												Having played all the old Mechwarrior/Mercenaries games on the PC and SNES, Mechcommander and even the Battletech mux's, I was hoping for something with a little more depth.The starting bonus was nice and I don't mind the small selection of maps to play on, but unfortunately the game gets repetitive too quickly with the 3 modes offered that just felt too similar. The game just doesn't hold my interest enough for me to recommend it even with the F2P tag. "

												This entire game is just endless quickplay style matches. There is nothing else to do either than buy mechs, equip them and then launch in a meaningless match. No real community except for the CW mode, and it's a terrible game mode that isn't fun at all.There is almost no difference between the three game modes, they mostly play out the same each round in that one team kills the other then the match ends. Each team consists of 12 people per side, I believe this is too many people especially for the smaller maps.			"

												Mechwarior Online (MWO).Just typing these words will inspire emotion in several of us older ""kids"" who may well be pusing our 40's. I have been playing and collecting stuff from this universe since the 1980's when I was in grade school. To put it lightly PGI has an oppurtunity to cash in on my nostalgia and sell a piece of my childhood back to me.Many of you are younger. You may never have heard of this title, or the previous games. The idea of little me sitting with a friend and nervously moving cardboard cut outs on a hex map could be hilarious. The question is, is there something here for both of us? I say yes. PGI has made several choices that take the game away from a direct port of the old table top rules. This is good, those rules were not well balanced and the mechs there were not able to face each other with anything like parity. In table top bigger was better.Here in MWO each weight class, there are four, is played by a single individual. Unlike previous titles all are viable in the battlefield. The little mechs can take on the big ones and win. Similatly Clan versus Inner Sphere balance is better on this platform than in any other location. In table top the balance was performed with points and Clans got fewer mechs. That does not work in an online enviroment. In MWO Clan mechs are situationally better than Inner Sphere mechs, and IS mechs are situationally better in others. In any situation pilot skill and teamwork are more important than loadout.Pilot Skill and Teamwork. These are the hallmarks of this game. Battles can be as deep or shallow as your interaction with the other players. If you are looking to be a lone rambo, try light mechs, but this is probably not the game for you.If you like working with others for a common goal, and you like big robots killing each other, this is definately the game for you.If you are a new player looking for a group many of us will gladly welcome new players. I run with House Steiner. Killing clanners as often as I can.I'm Stelar 7. I've been playing since open beta, I heartily endorse this game.Find me on TS at House Steinerts1.housesteiner.comLegion of Phoboslegionofphobos.teamspeakservers.com "

												Ignore the time played. I have logged many hours in this game and have been playing since 2013.  I highly recommend trying this game! At it's core, it's a team based tactical shooter featuring giant war machines that are adequately referenced from the impressive lore/universe known as BattleTech.  It may not be for everyone, but it definitely has a type of player it attracts. If thinking-based tactical shooters are your cup of tea, then this will be a game for you. If you enjoy customizing things across a wide variety of platforms and creating your own unique builds, then this will be a game for you. If you love games that require attention to detail, then this will be a game for you. If you enjoy playing as a team and being part of a dedicated community, then this may be a game for you! Competitive or casual, this game seems to have something for different types of gamers. I won't lie, MechWarrior Online has had it's rough moments. There was a time where I left for a while because I felt the game back in 2013 was a bit too grindy and was missing some key elements. I returned a few months back and there have been MASSIVE improvements to this game. It's no where near grindy as it was and it actually has one of the best free to play models out there. This is by no means a pay to win game. In the hundreds of hours I have logged into this game, I have spent a grand total of $20. It wasn't necessary but I felt like getting a set of Mechs early. In reality, some of my best Mechs were purchased via the in-game currency. As a new player, you will have a cadet bonus for your first 25 matches and completing the tutorial along with that will net you quite a substantial amount of C-bills (the in game currency). You can choose to pay for premium time if you want, but it isn't necessary by any means. Plus, there are a lot of in game events that take place every once in a while that give players a wide array of bonuses. Bottom line, you can be competitive and have fun without spending any money. The developers have been listening to the community more and the game has a good roadmap for future improvements. This game is in good hands and there is a huge community behind it. There are tons of resources to help you along the way. A short list of these resources include: The MWO official forums, specifically the guides/new player sectionsMechspecs.comMetamechs.comThe Outreach HPG subredditI highly recommend that you give this game a shot and do your best to find a unit or community that has a TS server or it's equivalent! Being part of a unit has several bonuses and it's a total gamechanger in terms of finding reliable teamwork and assistance. This game punishes the lonewolf types. Trust me, in order to get the best experience you should try to find a unit/open to the public teamspeak. This is not to say you can't have fun just dropping in public groups queue or just going solo, you certainly can, it's just that being part of a community can enhance the experience of this game tenfold.  There are tons of units recruiting on the steam forums and the MWO forums. Go check it out!  "

												While the basic Mech on Mch play is ok, that's all there is to the game. There's pretty much nothing here from the lore other than PGI trying to cash in on nostalgia. This isn't the game you are looking for in a MW/BT game, unless you're just here for a repetitive arena shooter with mech skins. All the time in development and post release and all the game really has to offer is 3 mostly similiar game modes and lots of mechs to buy. The prices are high. The development slow and usually 1 step forward and 2 steps back. All in all, I can't recommend it and if you try it please don't give this company any money until you've played a bit. You can survive on the initial trials and the Cadet bonus and such before you really should spend any real money if you so decide. I'm a Legendary Founder so let my mistakes help save you the time and most importantly the cash. When the best most positive reviews can manage is to point out it's free so you've got nothing to lose ( if you don't value your time) it's not the most ringing endorsement.			"

												I love Mechwarrior, the old mechwarrior, the games that had single player campains, this Mechwarrior Online is for the hard core players that only like PvP. Its free to play, as long as you dont mind a selecton of 3 light Mechs that you cant save configurations. It has a long grind and 3 kinds of exp points to get enough to buy your own mech. Most of the game is surrounded by cash purchases. Like paying for time of advanced 30% exp earnings while playing, but that time is wasted while you sleep , the clock doesnt stop. You can buy Mech packs or points to buy mechs. If Mechwarrior and Titanfall had a single player campain lovechild, Id move heaven and hell to get it. But I cant recomend this unless your bored and have plenty of spare cash. Little depth, Titanfall is more gripping, but also little depth. Id play it if Im in the mood for a blast from the past.			"

												Mechwarrior Online has had a bumpy road, its not perfect, has some annoying issues, a community that contains a portion players that feel self entitled because money or hours played or some other nonsense and a Developer that has a slow turn-around. Don't get me wrong, I love this game for all its flaws, been playing it for close to 3 years.If you are looking for an in-depth story driven MMORPG in the BATTLETECH universe, you'll be disappointed.BUTIf you are looking for a quick, instant deathmatch with ginormous metal mechs, perfecting your mech-fu with friends and general explosive-y goodness, then give this a try. :)Thinking mans game? sure.Kinda expensive? true dat, but you don't need to spend a sent and still do good.Pay-to-win mechs? pffft as if. Whoever said that doesn't know what he\her is talking about. Almost all MC-only  hero mechs are slightly worse than their standard C-bill counterparts. The rest are just slightly above average.Frequent events and give aways? Check.So many butt-hurt and salty people lately... -_-			"

												Wow, what a refreshing shooter.I enjoy the fact that you win by trading damage over the duration of the match, as opposed to the twitchy reflexes required in CSGO or CoD.  Positioning accounts for so much here, and random headhots are SO MUCH rarer than in CSGO (yeah, I meant to hit you in the head with my P90 spray from 50 yards away...).  I played a bit before MWO went to steam, and I like the virtually unlimited customizability for your mechs.  Take some long range missiles to soften up enemies from a safe distance, or pack on the lasers and autocannons to shred your enemies from closer in.Seems pretty grindy to start up though.  Either put in some cash to get some starter mechs or mech bays, or be prepared for a moderate grind to get up to speed.  Also, it's more expensive than other micro-transaction-based games, but I think that's because Battletech is an old universe, so many of the players are older and have jobs, thus are willing to fork out some cash.  If you enjoy the game though, then it's worth it.Oh, FYI, NEVER SELL AN ENGINE!  You're probably just going to rebuy it when you finally figure out what's going on later, but you'll be down a few million CBills.I absolutely recommend this game.  Very different pacing from other shooters. It rewards patience and good decisions.  Win over several minutes, not in a frantic 10-second shootout.			"

												I can recommend this game if you meet these two reasons:1. You love Battletech.2. You don't mind a Free to Play setup for your Battletech game. (Free to Play being Pay to Win)Now with that being said I downloaded this for free realizing it was Free to Play from the description. No harm there since I want to look things over. I tried it out and the test range tutorals and it feels like a mix between Mechwarrior 2, 3, and 4. The mechs handle nicely and the graphics are very nice during game play.The interface for creating custom mechs is there but it's somewhat limited to the hard point concept setup I'm guessing in started in Mechwarrior 4. That's the first time I remember seeing something like that which limited choices on mech/omni-mech designs. I hate that part of the game since I used to be a big time pen and papper battletech player and loved creating mech designs just to try out. So in that respect the game is limiting for me and puts a dampener on my interest in playing. The other aspect that contributes to this is the Free to Play model limitations.Personally I wish this wasn't an MMO Free to Play setup. The game is good but I think it would have been better if it were more like the Mechwarrior series before it in that there's a single player campaign but with a more robust multiplayer setup. This is basically a big cash grab using Battletech. Nice if you have the cash to blow on it but not so much if you want more then just that.Update 01/14/2016 - I put some time in to this and some money. The barrier for entry in to this game is dependant by the choice of grinding out tons of C-Bills for mech and equipment purchases which is perfectly fine. The other aspect is the fast track to buying mechs with real money. That being said the prices for some of those add-ons is really high when you look at the mech bundles.In game mech purchases provide a wide variety of choices but there are some limited to the Pay to Play credits or Mech Credits which you buy for real cash. Also expanding your garage for more mechs requires you to put real cash in which seems fine to me really for a pay to play system as well as the certain mechs requiring paying cash to get. A big downer I've had playing however is that in order to get better mastery of a mech you like you must purchase other variants of that mech and pilot those. So basically to level up your favorite mech you have to pilot other mechs to unlock the higher progression trees. I think that stinks in that if you are going to master something you don't practice with something else to master it. I feel this was put in to push people towards paying to buy mechs more frequently. The game itself isn't fun when you have to pilot something else to level and play the one mech you enjoy most.There is an instant messaging system in the game for when you aren't in matches so don't expect to find many social areas in the game itself like chat rooms or something. I've yet to find them myself in there. Really it's like paying WoW's BG system with Battletech and not having any place to socialize afterwards. I'm guessing you are limited to game forums and steam forums for that.Final thoughts: Don't spend any money till after your first 25 bonus matches are completed. Stick with the trial mechs and use them to get your initial C-Bill boost. It'll go a long way to saving up for a mech you find fun to pilot unless the trial mech is a Mech Credit only mech where you have to pay real money for.			"

The Pros     + Almost 0 pay to win    + Rewards twitchy skills AND strategic thinking in combat    + Sophisticated hitzone system    + Rewards experimenting through customization (half the battle is fought, before it even began)    + Customization is HUGE (for combat and aesthetics)    + Many, very different, mechs and designs to choose from     + No negative incomes -> never worry about losing money for bad matches    + Rewards Teamplay    + Pretty unique experience    + It's big stompy robots! The Cons	    - Ingame earnings aren't very high (recently buffed, so its better now)    - Some optional, but helpful stuff takes rather long to get    - Balance could absolutely be better (though not horrible)    - Learning curve is steep and acquired skill vanishes quickly when not played for a while    - There could be more maps    - Too many ""spend your money on this"" events, which distracts even if optional Overall a very unique game among all those twitch heavy shooters and hectic arena games out there. I especially love how it combines these elements with a very tactical, slower paced environment. The mechs and their designs are really cool and add a lot to the game, even more so for mechwarrior fans. Take into account the steep learning curve though and don't give up if piloting seems hard at first.If you love experimenting with many different builds and having a lot of options, this is also a game for you.

												(Update: Review edited after the initial excitement wore off a bit.)TL:DR - one of the best F2P games here. You get your own mech and are not forced to pay real money if you don't want to. You'll hate the constant long range guided missile sniping (or love it, if you'll be one of the people doing it).Good and active community, maps, everything. Runs on CryEngine.But above all... The mechs.The game creates a very good sense of ownership. When you buy your first mech, it can remind you a bit of Star Citizen. Beautiful cockpits, detailed design. You have to carefully choose the loadout for whatever you plan to do, and you will most likely get it very wrong at first. And die a lot. When you get into it a bit, it'll get more fun. See that giant assault mech? Grab a ligt mech, run around it and just shoot it legs off to kill it. Or walk into the wrong corner of the map and get caught in the cross-fire of 8 enemy mechs.Stragety first. Fighting second. You'll probably like your mech a lot and won't rush into sensless battles. You go alone, you die. You go with your group, you won't die as quickly.What costs actual money: Color customizations, special mechs (which generate more XP and in-game currency, meaning they ain't worth it) and other useless stuff. It's better to just look at the pretty red and blue mechs of other paying players ;).As for optimization,  I've seen some complaints here. I mean okay, it's not perfect, but it runs smoothly without crashes on a i3 6157u with Iris 550 on mid-to-high settings. Just turn off the shadow effects and you're fine.			"

												A fun game, with good graphics and a generally friendly playerbase.- If you like tinkering around with loadouts and armor distributions this game is for you. - If you like the idea of running around in a 25-100 ton war machine, laying waste to your enemies, this game is for you.- If you like the idea of a truly free to play system where teamwork trumps loadout every time this game is for you.If you want to win by a landslide every time as a solo player, maybe look somewhere else.Quick advice for beginners:- stick with your team- google and read the mwo Tactics 101 comics			"

												  First off it is a free to play model game.  Knowing that if you are patient you can quite feasably never spend real money on anything in this game and be competitive and slowly grow your stable of mechs.  There are always events going on that have various rewards: in game currency(CBills), mechbays (which you need to stable more mechs), cosmetics and even small amounts of MC( purchased currency used to buy hero mechs, mech bays camo patterns etc etc.)  The game has a pretty steep learning curve, learning maps, heat, weapon ranges etc all while staying alive, but the community is friendly, the forums are a great resource for any questions and plenty of helpful people to ask questions.  Now this being a f2p game if you want to play more than the 4 mechs your initial 4 bays alllow the best place to drop some money on the game is for mechbays. a few dollars will get you a good number of bays.    The important thing to note about this game is buying a ""hero"" mech does not give you a competitive advantage and in most cases the ""hero"" mech is no better and sometimes has a worse layout over a standard mech varient.  The only big thing a ""hero"" mech will give you is a 30% bonus to CBills when you complete a match which cuts the grind for in game currency before you can purchase that next mech, weapon, module.  Other thing of note is that unlike call of duty type game there is no respawn, your mech has a set amount of armor and structure it can use to absorb incoming damage before you are destroyed, and friendly fire isn't very friendly in MWO.  Watch you fire lines, stay with the team and manage your heat.			"

The battlefields of the 31st century are dominated by powerful mechanized units known as BattleMechs. You will assume the role of an elite MechWarrior, fighting for supremacy over the galaxy. - Highly Recommended!			"

												Well, where to start.Even if i play this Game more and more and sometimes really, really enjoying it, I cant recommend it.And here is why:First:The Tier-rating, by which matchmaking is done, is utterly and totally broken. Why? because your matchrating is more or less totally dependend on your team.  Lets give You an example: today I did two matches with the same Mech to farm a little XP. I am by no means ""good"" in this machine, im just farming XP so I become ""Master"" in my favorite MECH. But thats not the point. In one of the Games I did about 500 Damage, destroyed multiple components (but made no Kills), did multiple scoutings and earned a hell of lot of ""flanking""-bonuses. But - we lost. The Game after that I did about 130 Damage and have been killed without being any real use for my team but they did win anyway. Guess what game did cost me points in my ranking and wich one gained me the same? (for those, who didnt get it: it was not the 500 damage game that gained) Yeah, right. Not only that, I got 3 to 5 times the amount of XP and Ingamecredits. Yeah - I got it, not because I was good, but my team did alright. Fair? I guess not.Well You could say: learn teamplay so You can influence Your teamperformance. But I dont believe one person would make a differnce, because you will see time and again and again and again other players ramming and even shooting You just to get the killshotbonus. GreatSecond: deleted due to edit (see below)Third: For me the most important reason, but totally subjective. Im an old man (for a computergamer), and im not so fast any more, so guess what I kind of mechs im playing - Yeah big, slow, artillery mechs with lots of missiles raining death from afar. But, to be effective with this kind of mechs, You NEED scouts, and in the low tiers I am playing, fast scouting mechs run around trying to do kills, and do not mark anybody for their teammates, who could kill faster (by far!). (btw.: the mech i was playing to farm xp (the one i mentioned at the beginning) is a ""snipermech"" with longrangelasers and ac2s. For an artillerymech 500 damage is not so much at all.) Killshotbonus gives more points than ""narc""-ing, and of course everybody is only thinking about his own advantage. So I try to do the scouting all by myself. Its just WoT all over again. No tactics, only positioning, if you are not playing in a team. Otherwise its a pretty slowplaying shooter.edit:Well, after reading all the comments about ""Pay to win"".:Well, Maybe, this is the wrong wording. But its not ""Free to play"" either, and that is, what my problem is all about.MWo is, in this regard, exactly like nearly all of the so called ""free to play""-titles I ever played. It is totally like WoT in this regard, a game where I also fell into the trap of free playing and paying for it, because i had a clan and wanted to reach a goal. Later I left the Game and the Clan because I just added all the little purchasses I tock to a sum and realized, what I was doing - spending 100s of bucks for a game, that, frankly, as a ""normal game"" wouldnt even score 30 bucks and I would never have bought for more than 20.MWo is not ""amazing"". It is a slow playing shooter with a little bit of tactics (that gets ignored quite a lot from most players, who just want to score maxdam and maxkills) that reminds me of days past, when i played my first tabletopgame back in the 80s with my work buddies (Yes, i am that old).Hell, the game doesnt even have a real community-function where you can chat and meet new people, You can only chat with your ""friends"" or during matches. A set of Battlemechs cost about 30 dollars(!) and yes, while i dont ""need"" them to win the odd qickplay, it gives me a definite advantage. Again it is like WoT in this regard - you werent ""forced"" to buy a premium tank in this game, but... Yeah, it gave You an advantage.Most of the quickplay-games have become boring like hell, because they are always the same. Faction play is out of discussion because I need to form my own Unit or become a loyalist to earn anything. And if I find some people who play with me, I would need to break my contract and get punished. What kind of stupid gamemechanics is this? While i understand the fluff behind it, it is overly restrictive for new players who want to find a group.The Matchmaking is absolutly broken and playerranking as well - hell i did a game with nearly 900 damage, two solokills and about 5 kmdd and we lost - but i didnt gained any rankingpoints for this game, i just managed to not loose any points in my ranking. When i do 30 damage and my team will win, i will earn points in the ranking - WTF!? In 90% of the games it isnt a close game anyways: one side will steamroll the other and all you do is trying to do as much damage as possible. Because damage and kills seem to be everything after matchwinning in playerranking.So, the best stragtegie to get higher in rank is: be egoistic, DONT play together, steal the killshot and hide in corners while your team gets wrecked, so you can do your solokill. Because thats the only way to do good damge if Your team is steamrolled. and if Your team is the steamrolling one, one mech doenst makes a differnce.Those are NOT gamemechanics why I play a teambased game.(and so i dont do it, try to narc and scout and give protection fire for my teammates, even run between a heavily wounded TM and the enemy to shield it, so he can shoot a little bit longer)Im not narrowminded. I am just not Pippi Longstockings and chance the world like i want in seeing only the positive things.plz notice: English is not my natural language, so I will make mistakes.			"

												Legendary founder played since close beta. Alot of troll post and begrudged former / still playing players. I want to start by saying play it and come up with your own review.I enjoy the game and play reguraly if im not burned out with the group i roll with. I recomend finding a group that most benefits into helping you out getting into the game.There are some aspects to it that are very lackluster and some dev decisions that are quite questionable, but as of right now, currently, i can see growing improvements to the game. Devs are working on a more purpose CW so its not a ghost town and purposeless also taking small but i think decent steps into balancing between clans vs IS. The company is small but there are updates every other week. If you're new dont spend those c-bills right away. Find what mech suits your playstyle then commit those cadet bonuses are only up to 25 matches.			"

												If you like the idea of piloting a giant walking war machine, you've come to the right place.  There is a learning curve, but it's worth it.  Is it really free to play?  Is it pay to win?  It IS free to play.  If you want to speed the grind along faster, you can pay.  You do not gain any measurable play advantage by using real money.  The best mechs in the game are FREE(using in game currency, not real $).You will read some negative reviews.  IMHO, they fit into the following:  1) Crusty MWO veterans who are bitter about something from 3 years ago.  2) Short attention span players who aren't willing to put in more than 10 minutes to learn the game.  3)  People that don't like the idea of  big stompy robots fighting other big stompy robots.I have played this game extensively for over 2 years, and I keep coming back.  It's addicting and a ton of fun.  See you on the battlefield!			"

YouTube™ Video: #MWO - Mechwarrior Online 2015 Review 

			Views: 6,760		

			Game: Mechwarrior Online (PC) Here is the review of a very unique styled F2P thinking fps. It's a lot to take but certainly worth a look. Don't forget to rate comment or subscribe!		

I gave it a 7.9 back then and thing have changed quite a bit since.So, for my personnal satisfaction and to help people around steam here is a new look at the game. Several months later.I want to start by saying that F2P games are usualy a gamble.Some games will go out and shine and others will die a few seasons after it's initial release.I've supported MWO since the alpha and beta by purchasingthe Legendary Founder pack for a roughly 120$I've since invested around 650$ more in Pirhana's game and so far, I haven't been desapointed.Mechwarrior Online is first and foremost a thinking shooter.It relies heavily on situation awareness and chassis build rather than quick reflexes and headshot.You still need to be quite good at aiming to hit the important and damaged componenet of your enemy but overall it's not as big of a factor as for say Counter Strike, Hawken or Battlefield.That being said, since MWO is a f2p game, you will start with 4 mech bays for you to fill with your own mech you will purchase and 20 matches of ""recruit"" that will give you around 10 000 000 cbills that you can invest in chassis and customizing them. So far so good. However, some of the heavier mechs are worth up to 33 000 000 cbills. Calculate that matches give you around 80 000 to 200 000 per match without premium, you will have to play a lot before getting you hand on them. That being said, investing on a 33 000 000 cbill mech doesnt give you an instant victory machine. Since mechs are seperated in 3 classes, light, medium, heavy and assault. They all have purpose and are fairly balanced. I'm saying fairly because some mechs are obviously better than others. Depending on their loadout, profile size, armor, speed and weapon mounting point. Overall thou, it's quite balance and once you know the chassis strength and weakness you will know what battle is worth fighting.The game sets two teams of 12 players against each other. Quickplay allows you to jump directly on the battlefield and gives the players a quick vote on which map and playstyle to fight for. It works well and makes the game a lot more viable than the old imposing system. There is also 3 main server around the world so you shouldn't have problems of connectivity as well. Community Warfare is the second part of the game, you can choose a faction and fight for them on a galactic space map. It works well and gives you 4 mechs to bring on a single battlefield. It's intense, relies heavily on teamplay for success. A victory will give you reputation points toward the chosen faction as well as a considerable amount of cash. The game will however average 25 to 30 minutes.Mechs are fun to play with and works mainly like tanks. Which means the legs and torso can turn seperatly from one another. Arms also have free movement compared to the mounted weapons. It gives MWO a special type of gameplay that ask for more thoughtfull movement. Weapons varies from small machine guns, lasers, long range missiles and automatic AC 20. They all have different type of attacks, heat displacement and damage output. Half of the game is centered around cusotmizing the mech and fortunately it's very enjoyable. Experimenting around and just going all gooffing around gives the game deep possibilities and management that is rare for any other game.Graphics have nice textures but overall effects are OKAY at best. The cryengine is demanding but models are sweet looking. Better yet is the animation and the waight of the mechs that gives the immersive sense of huge humanoid robot combat pleasant.Sound is again, adequate but the music is boring and some gun sounds cheap. Some great moment arrives thou when in space and the echoes of explosion on the cockpit shakes about and ♥♥♥♥♥ing betty is telling you that you are about to die in agony.MWO is fun, but it's more a love or hate relationship. Try it, you have nothing to lose. It's best played in team and there is no pay 2 win mentality. If you play for a while, buy yourself some pack and help Pirhana invest back in the community.Board a nice Timber Wolft, Equip some LRM's and Medium Pulser laser and deliver death and destruction.Take care!  Category Score   Graphics 7   Sound Design 7.5   Gameplay 8.5   Replayability 10   Fun factor 8   Price for Content 10  "

												Been playing MWO off and on since release.  Spent more than I probably should but honestly I have gotten/am getting enough hours of enjoyment out of it.  It is a difficult game to get into because of the learning curve coupled with the sometimes questionable matchmaking.  I find the solo queue matchmaking does a pretty good job, but as soon as you drop as a group it feels like you get thrown to the wolves a bit.  Those of you with the ability to accept that you need to improve to be competitive will do fine but if you are the type to look for hand holding and easy wins then you will be in for a short stint with the game.  If you can get to the point where you are proficient with the game and better still invest yourself enough to join up with ta unit to gain the advantages that proper group play allow then you will have a really enjoyable time with the game.  The devs are balancing and adding content fairly regularly as well as events going on in game pretty often as well.  So good luck to new players, keep an open mind and don't be afraid to ask for help on the official forums.  www.mwomercs.com "

												The game has come a long way from Open Beta DaysPro's - There is now a good tutorial that rewards players with currency to purchase their first BattleMech when completing training. In addition there is New Player Bonus's to assit in affording first purchase's - Seperate testing grounds to learn the maps and test new weapon loadouts on stationary targets. - Large number of maps with dynamic environments and temperature effects. - 3 basic game modes in addition to the Community Warfare mode with additional maps and game modes. - A large number of BattleMech's to choose from to then build and customise to suit your own game styles on the battlefield. - Large number of promotions that can reward players with free Mech's, MechBays, in game pretty's, in game currency and in game version of real currency etc - Competitive play led by community groups - Team focused play where a single player relys on his team for victory.Con's - High initial learning curve - Cost to purchase MechBays to increase your number of Mech's over an initial 4. - Poor development history due to company IGP. Since IGP has been removed from this project things have rapidly improved leaps and bounds. - Some times over customisation and grinding to optimise Mech's - Team and skill balancing issues still pursist due to small community. - Ocianic Server providing the same ping to North American Servers for Australian players.

												Edit: While I still would recommend the game to anyone with a passing interest in mech combat the lethargic pace of development has just got me really down on actually wanting to play this continuously. A mech is announced months before it comes out, and then it goes out to the pre-orderers, then a month later it comes out for cbills. It just fosters this environment of staleness, perhaps this will be fixed this coming summer with the addition of new weapons and tech, but until then me picking the game up since i stopped playing months ago feels exactly the same.I feel PGI could learn a lot about improving their model from other games such as WarFrame, I understand there's limitations for a niche game like MWO that wouldn't necessarily work like that, but the annoyance I get out of not wanting to get new mechs outweighs that heavily.=========I've been playing since the closed beta, i'm also a fan of battletech, so that means i'm pretty biased.This game is fun, I enjoy it off and on, and would like to see its continued support from its developers, PGI.1. How to deal with the grind, the problem is when you're playing to buy something, playing to level up something, playing to unlock something, the trick is to play with a unit, go find one, make friends with people who are generally nice in the game, if they are part of a unit, ask if you can join them, they'll hook you up.2. If you find someone calling orders in game, and their orders changed the tide of battle, add that sucker to your friends list			"

												This is a very fun game.  Yes, if you are new you will get your face smashed in until you figure out how to use your head.  It's a very complicated game that allows for a lot of customization.Mech pricing is kind of high and a lot of people are emotional about it in reviews... I don't understand that because you don't have to buy anything to have fun.  You can use the trial mechs, most of which are excellent.  Forget about the grind and just have fun... You have a lot of options.The bottom line is that this game is very fun.			"

												         This game could be great if it wasn't filled with people wall hacking and aim botting. Durring the weekdays it is fun to play but as soon as the weekend hits or an event starts then you see people getting perfect headshots from 600+meters away and shooting through walls. The worst part is that they do nothing to stop them even in the $4000 tournament.			"

												I've been playing MWO since closed beta and i definetly recommend this free game, it still needs work in some areas, specifically Community Warfare, but the core gameplay is solid, and has kept me coming back since 2012 because it's so damn fun! hook up with a Teamspeak group because teamwork is the key to victory. if you use reddit, check out /r/OutreachHPG, the comunity there is very friendly and helpful for new players.there are definetly some issues, but none of them justify NOT trying this free game. jump in, blow something up, and have fun!

												How do I put this?Mechwarrior Online is my stop-gap in the battletech universe until something more in-fiction and deep shows up. The combat is good, it's fun and it's (currently) fair, but it is not the immersive experience I want from a Battletech game (and honestly, what MWO pretended it was going to be).It's free and the combat is good, you might aswell give it a go.

												Been playing MWO off and on since release.  Spent more than I probably should but honestly I have gotten/am getting enough hours of enjoyment out of it.  It is a difficult game to get into because of the learning curve coupled with the sometimes questionable matchmaking.  I find the solo queue matchmaking does a pretty good job, but as soon as you drop as a group it feels like you get thrown to the wolves a bit.  Those of you with the ability to accept that you need to improve to be competitive will do fine but if you are the type to look for hand holding and easy wins then you will be in for a short stint with the game.  If you can get to the point where you are proficient with the game and better still invest yourself enough to join up with ta unit to gain the advantages that proper group play allow then you will have a really enjoyable time with the game.  The devs are balancing and adding content fairly regularly as well as events going on in game pretty often as well.  So good luck to new players, keep an open mind and don't be afraid to ask for help on the official forums.  www.mwomercs.com "

												Game is not like the trailers. I wish it were.I paid and played in beta, and it was alot more fun then, than now.Piranha Games promised a lot of things that they didn't deliver and still have not delivered.There are plenty of articles about it already.Instead of focusing on gameplay that is true to the historical Mechwarrior universe they decided to come up with there own alterations because it would make them more money in transactions. They added ballancing querks to mechs which really shouldn't exist, but it was a lazy way the could get their non- mechwarrior universe gameplay ballanced without acctualy having to work on the mechanic. They also added consumables of which the best quality are pay only. It sets up a pay to win mechanic in the game.Since launch, Piranaha Games only focus is to put out more content for people to buy.  While this is not a bad thing in of itself this should have been done after they finished delivering what they promised. The game play now though flawed is still fun for casual play.Just don't encourage Piranha Games' bad behavior and pay for anything.			"

												Put simply, MWO is the most balanced MechWarrior, one of the most balanced Free to Play games I've played, and one of the most fair Free to Play models I've seen. I've come from very pay to win, grindy, unbalanced games like Need For Speed World, and from previous MechWarrior games. The fact that every mech chassis has at least 3 variants available for all players, just months after release, is great. Hero mechs should only be thought of as another mech variant for its chassis, as they only come with a C-Bill earnings boost, unique hardpoints, and are derived from a specific pilot in the battletech lore. C-Bills can purchase everything you need to be competitive, things like camo will cost real momey, but it's not too expensive. This defeats the argument that this game is pay to win (those who dispute I'd like to hear your reasoning.) As I stated earlier, it's the most balanced MechWarrior, and in comparison to other Free to Play games, it's balanced enough to the point that saying a mech sucks means that another mech chassis can run a build better. Gameplay is all about teamwork and knowing how to get the most performance out of your mech. Those who play CSGO know the drill, communicate and work with your team. On a final note, I want to talk about the dev team. For a franchise like MechWarrior, the playerbase has gone down since the last release over a decade ago. They have taken a risk with the additions of the ""unseen"" mechs like the Marauder and Warhammer, the Warhammer being the reason why MechWarrior 5 had to be cancelled. They have done great work with the designs and games balance, as well as how they handle the business. The fact that people shame them, call them worst dev team ever, and say they should lose their license to the MechWarrior franchise sickens me. When there's corrupt dev teams like Gaijin barely getting any backlash from their actions, it makes me wonder why PGI does from the majority of the community. They're by no means perfect, things were rough earlier on, but now they are a much better dev team than they were 3 years ago. For a community like the MechWarrior community, It makes me upset that one of the nicest game communities is so hostile to a very nice dev team. But to wrap it all up, MWO is a balanced Free to Play game that is not Pay to Win, and is more skill based than some other popular vehicular MMO's (World of Tanks in particular).			"

Posted: December 13, 2015
												First off let me explain some small details I have been playing this game since closed beta. In a time when 4 mechs roamed the 2 maps. Things have been good things have gone bad. All in all thou things are getting much better and the dev team is commited to that. Yes some people feel butt hurt that certain things did not live up to their hype to witch they wanted this game to be fair enough. I have had times of feeling this, but I have stuck around because with out MWO their probably would not be a mechwarrior title out their again for who knows how many years. The hardest part of this game is the learning cruve it is more complacated then to just react point and shoot like most FPS. Please consider this when you get fustrated it is also very much a team game and that is something the Dev can not balance in any factor. MWO has a lot of highly skilled teams that play together and know how to play. PSR (pilot skill rating) should help alittle in quick play matches not to put any teir 5 noobs vs teir 1 highly skilled pilots. It can happen in low populations times but rare. Also keep in mind faction play does not have any PSR protection that is a free drop for any 12man unit can face pugs and pugs can face pugs. but no psr is used to creat matches. Weapons all have been given ranges and heat based off the TT battletech. Some changes are inheirity needed for clan tech on paper clan tech is op. The dev have done a decent job of keeping the power creep to clan tech down. This has upset the clan faction die hards who want the clans to be the op force they are. again hints some of the neg reviews from that camp. In order to make this game a balanced game witch it is still working on things will change remember change is needed to insure a game contines to have lvl ground or a power creep comes in and then that it. No mech is a pay to win mech. I can take trash mechs and make them work other people can take trash mechs and make them work its all about skill and team work again.Pricing the pricing is fair they need to make some funds to keep lights and pay checks flowing. Doing the math a mech bay is roughly $1.60 something not bad and remember most of the mechs are free to get just takes some grinding.Last part proabaly lost most of you anyhow. Grind it happens its been far worse in this game to grind out money the 25 match cadet bonus what was that saw it put in. I have seen rewards cut and now bumped back up ya it was far worse. Best thing I can tell new players get your reward c-bills and don't by a mech right out play some more matches with all the trail mechs make sure you find a weight class and style you like to play then buy your frist mech and customize it to your liking. but remember meta will come knocking on all door steps people will find the best combo of mech weapon and then blast the crap out of you in any teir. I normally try not to meta, meta does have week points the Streak crow has very little leg armor just a hint for any one out their cussing at your screen because of them. Light mechs stay away from them. Thank you for reading this, and considering MWO it can be a very fun game and can also be fustratiing. Tsula SGT in C4			"

												I've been playing MWO since Feb 2012, and I can't say that I've come across another game that's kept me that engaged. Now, to be fair, I'm a BT/MW self confessed fanboy, so PGI had a big head start in gaining a seal of approval! That being said, I highly recommend giving MWO a look. On condition that you don't want a game where you're instantly godlike in terms of skill. There's a bit of a learning curve, but if you put a bit of time in and accept initially you may well have terrible matches initially whilst you learn the basics, you'll be well rewarded. My suggestion - watch streams, I learnt a huge amnount when I first started (twitch is a good place to start), and ask questions of the streamers and the viewers. 99% of the MWO community are great guys and girls who will be more than happy to help.MWO is a true free to play game. You can be successful and have fun without spending a single penny. At most you used to have to admit, well, you do need to buy mechbays at a buck or two a pop, but PGI give so many away these days (via Faction Play achievements for example) that even this isn't necessary any more. Mechs come out in packages for real world monies with some extra swag (if you pre-order early enough) several months before they're available for in game currency. But that extra swag is mainly cosmetic, nothing in there gives you an ingame advantage. However, those exact mechs will be available for free eventually. There are no 'you must buy this to win' mechs. Hero and special mechs come with a boost to the earnings you can make in in game currency per match, at 30%. However, those mechs don't garauntee you will have a good match, they're no better than the standard variants available. Champion mechs give a boost in a similar way but to XP earned. In all honesty, champion versions of the standard variants aren't something that's ever appealed to me. When you have a mech, you need to 'level it up' through basic, elite and master skills. This slightly improves things such as it's heat efficiency, maneuverability, speed etc. Which is where the XP comes in. XP is earned in matches along with CBills (currency). You have to have 3 variants of a mech at full basic level before you can work on elite skills. Once elite skills are done, you can then complete the master skills. Once one mech is mastered for a weight class, you only have to basic three variants of a new mech, from there you can if you choose elite and master a single variant. This levelling of mechs is where some folks say it's a bit of a grind, along with earning cbills to buy new mechs, but I've never found it to be too big of an issue personally.There are also mastery packs available which give you several variants of a mech chassis that are available for cash, at big savings if you bought them separately (plus some extras I think but I'm not too sure on that). I'm not going to comment on the value of the mastery packs, after 3 years and 150 or so mechs in the garage, they're not something I've had a need to look at, so I'll just make you aware they're there if you want to take a look at them. But at a glance, to me they seem good value if you want to spend real money on something which largely (but not everything) consists of content available for in game currency. Value is subjective, if you have the cash avaialble, it's your choice!Anyway, personally I love the game, when balance issues arise PGI are usually pretty quick to change things, content is free flowing, and quite simply the game is a hell of a lot of fun! And the great thing is, there's much more content to come from PGI and MWO!			"

												To the new players for this game:The people who have been giving this game negative reviews are mostly salty players who expected an AAA game almost four years ago when the game was under the name of a completely different company. The game was run under IGP and they were horrible and stunded this game's growth.Now with that said, the game has been under to control of a new company, PGI for a while now. PGI has made GREAT strides in providing balance, reducing grind, and avoiding a pay-to-win game. The game is rather simplistic in game-modes but is not tiring as each map can be VERY different from the next with the simplest changes to a tactic. Tactics and team-work are huge in this game and makes everything so much more interesting. It is has a nice balance between teamplay and first person shooter that makes the game so much fun. Get a few friends to play the game with you, form a group, be aggressive, work together, and use the MIC and you will have a lot of fun. The game has made great strides this year alone and I high recommend it to anyone as it is one of the few games that truly changes and just has something that not even HAWKEN could provide. There's a huge learning curve but getting past it is SOOO satisfying!!!Anyway, in conclusion:Big-stompy-robots/10 would play again.			"

												I bought a founder pack for this game when it first came out and, while fun, I never really got into that much. I kept coming back to it every now and again to see what progress they made but never stuck around for long.Now that the game has come out on Steam I've come back again and this time I think I can honestly say the game is in a state where it is thoroughly enjoyable. It still has problems though, and if you're a diehard fan of BattleTech and the old MechWarrior games there are a few changes that might annoy you.As for the business model, I personally think it's quite fair. You can buy every mech for in-game earned money (C-Bills), although new mechs are only available for real money for a while after their release. Honestly you never have to spend a dime in this game to enjoy it. When you first start you get a huge boost to your income for the first 30 games or so, so you can buy whatever mech you like pretty fast (at least I think that's still a thing, it was when I played a year or so ago). Once your starter bonus is up you still make money at a very fair rate, and since playing the game is actually very fun, time will fly so fast you'll suddenly realise you have heaps of cash to buy a new mech or new weapons or whatever you want.So yeah, I heartily recommend this game! :D			"

												Faction Play needs some work.   Perhaps a little more explanation on exactly what you are signing up for when you get a contract with a clan,  or accept an invitation to a random player created ""unit"" (think Guild).  Signing up with a player-run guild locks you into a clan.   If you dont carefully research via the obtuse interfaces you willquickly end up unable to play with your friends for days, even after paying ingame currency to ""break contracts"" you can be saddled with a 3-day faction-play ban.

												General points:- The game is not Pay-To-Win in any way, shape, or form.  Everything can be purchased with Cbills, which are rewarded at the end of games.- The game has a very rough learning curve.  Those who do not know how to look one way while moving another are going to have problems here.- No, seriously, learning curve.  Additionally you have two crosshairs - one for your arms, the other for all torso-mounted weapons.  They will not necessarily be pointing at the same thing at any given point in time.- Most customization of a giant robot outside of the Armored Core series of games.- A-symmetrical warfare.  There are two sides to every conflict.  In this game it's the Inner Sphere vs the Clan.  Inner Sphere pilot mechs that are centuries old - clan mechs are the latest and greatest.  PGI has done a very good job keeping these concepts without overpowering one side or the other.- About that learning curve... There are mechanics that are not readily apparent.  When constructing your mech, look for a red 'yield' sign and mouse over it for further information.- The game really is free, and there's literally no reason not to try it.General review:  In no other game on the market can you play as a robot the size of a building, slinging shells the size of volkswagens to shear off plates of titanium, ceramic, steel, AND DIAMOND from other robots the size of buildings.  Mechwarrior Online is a Moba in the truest sense of the acronym - Multiplayer Online Battle Arena.  Select and customize your mech to take part in a 12 on 12 battle royales against other players and their unique snowflake mechs to see who will come out on top.  Ultimately, Mechwarrior Online is a very challenging slow-paced first person shooter that plays a lot like a simulation.  Moving your mech is increasing the throttle, and you accelerate to your top speed which not only varies from mech class to mech class (Light, Medium, Heavy, Assault) but from mech to mech (depending on the engine that you choose to bring).  Mechwarrior Online definitely isn't for everyone, but with a Free to Play model that isn't pay to win - you lose nothing for giving it a try.  6/10.Review for those who have played Mechwarrior Online since Beta (Founders):  The game has come a long way from when there were four mechs.  All told, the game still isn't everything that was asked for, but despite that, it's a game that after YEARS of play, we keep coming back to it.  Giving PGI credit where it's due 7/10.Review for those who have played other Mechwarrior Titles (MW 2,3,4):  Mechwarrior Online plays a lot different from the game you remember.  This is mostly because the game is a multiplayer experience only based on the World of Tanks gameplay and monitization system.  Matches were desinged to be played in 15 minutes or less, so there is definitely an arcade feel here.  As the most recent Mechwarrior title, its looks are far better than the previous titles (as it should), and the redesigns of the mech models are quite superb.  Mechbay is much different from what you would be used to - instead of swapping out weapons of a type to fill the slots available, mech customization is deeper, while similarly limited.  MWO has a steep learning curve, but as a Mechwarrior veteran you should be able to catch up quick.  7/10Review for those who play fast-paced mech titles (Armored Core series):  You aren't going to be impressed with this title as the gameplay is not what you are looking for.  Armored Core, while similar in the level of customization, also is far more fast paced.  Control over an Normal or Next is far less like operating a machine of war, and far more like playing a FPS where you look like a mech.  In AC, your mech has a total hitpoint value based on your  components, while in MWO your mech's health is determined by component.  This means you can be killed when your mech is at 65% simply by taking damage to your center torso and losing it, or having your cockpit destroyed (headshots), wheras AC doesn't have these distinctions.  AC's gameplay is a fast-paced gundam style while MWO is more like if you were trying to drive a World War 2 tank.  It's a free game so give it a shot, but you will be better served by playing Hawken.  4/10			"

People are predictable and the fun runs out QUICK. The graphics look great, but your stuck in the mech. I really liked the crysis mod that let you live in the battletech universe, maybe I'm just spoiled. I'm not going to continue playing this, I didn't even give it much time honestly but after I gave it a run I read up on the details to see if it would consume the next month of my life, but I'm safe.

												I welcome those who are new to this game and I recommend them to fully read this to both understand what to expect and what to do.A little background on my self with this game, I've been on this game non-stop 3-5 times weekly for teh past 2 years since the founding times so I know what I'm taking about. Also I'm playing all the way from Malaysia in Asia with my buddies/unit based in the US/UK regions and I have like over 120 mechs of both IS and Clan. I'm a Corporal rank in my unit, 1st Crucis Recon and previously we were from Head Hunters of Davion (Davion Faction's largest unit).What to expect:1) Light/Medium mechs are fast while Heavy/Assault mechs are slow but powerful (slow as in, you can time and see em turn like how an elephant turns it's body, so basically Light mechs run circles around the bigger guys literally).2) Mechs are expensive since it's Free To Play, but not impossible to achieve (when I started; with 0 mech of my own, I used the free trail version Hunchback for a week).3) Don't expect head shots every time, it's super hard to do and very rare (to date I've done less than 50).4) Grinding/making cash is faster with certain methods (I'll explain later).Very Important:For those starting, the first thing I recommend is to go setup your VOIP setting in game to ecnable radio communications.This game is all about teamwork with your teammates in every match.Read the guides/manuals/FAQ of the game when you progress further.And most important, play the tutorials to get a hang of things.Gameplay:For starters, there are 2 types of game; quickplay and Faction-play.Quickplay is a 12vs12 match in either Assault/Conquest/Skirmish mode.Faction-play is choosing a Faction to support by taking a contract (you can select how long; weeks/months/permanent), and playing either defense/attack of planets in a big war of 12vs12 (with each warrior respawn of 4 times/ 4 mechs each).Faction-play although slow and hard for beginners, is quite rewarding in it's faction rewards; some being in game c-bills, free mech bay, gxp, xp and more.I suggest doing some faction games done when you can to at least reach tier 3 of a faction's loyalty rewards programme, you need those free mech bays.So How Make C-Bills/More Mechs Fast?Play quickplay a lot. As a newbie/PUG, select trail mechs, run in groups with other veteran mechs (mechs with lots of custom paint jobs is a very clear sign) and help them in game. Don't run out alone to just die fast tot eh enemy, it has very little rewards given as c-bills. Doing more of teamwork during games gives you more rewards when you either win/lose the match.Keeping this in mind, it's best to stay alive with the team and if you die, just quit match, reselect another trail mech and find another match. Doing this method could easily see you making about 1million C-Bills within 1 hour. I got my first Hunchback (50 ton medium mech) within a day, so yeah, it's not that tough a grind.Keep playing this way to amke more money and soon you will pick up things like cutomization of your mech weapons, skills and how to use GXP, don't worry; the learning curve is not as hard as some might say, you just need to do some reading like I did.Gameplay Pros:1) Awesome graphics, details and effects2) Cutomizable mechs galore3) Nice flow of game play and one of the best times I had playing in groups/with teammates4) Rewards progression of skills, c-bills, game performance per matchCons:1) Like all Free To Play, you need to pay some to get to some more mechbays or cumization options like color and patterns.2) If your teammates don't know what they are doing, the match ends very quickly.

												So here we go.MechWarrior Online is an MMO sequel to the rather well known MechWarrior series set in the BattleTech universe created by FASA in 1984.While most of the MechWarrior games were good (sans MechAssault 1, 2, and Phantom War), this one started out... horrible. So I have been around this game since basically it came out, but I didn't play it until December of 2012. Since then I have watched it at its peaks, and at its worst. The game started out little more than Hawken, just slower paced. It was generic and not worth a dime. Now however it is really good.The game features very good mechanics to improve the experience (such as arms move separate of the torso which moves separate of the legs), and the maps are exponentially better. The game is still working on balance though. If you are familiar with the BT universe you know that the Clans were like... over powered gorillas in a house full of chimpanzees (kind of how they viewed the Inner Sphere philosophically too haha). They are like that here too. The weapons are extremely good, and just way better than anything the Inner Sphere can match. But in Community Warfare there is one thing that the Inner Sphere has on their side. Higher Tonnage rates which gives them the advantage of having more large mechs than the Clans. Now straight Clan mechs can't upgrade engines either. So there is some balance but unfortunately the Clans still are severely over powered at times.Overall the game is pretty decent. This community is newbie friendly (look up the B33f on the forums if you want training videos, or find me on occasion under the name Marack Drock), the game plays nicely, and there is a lot of content now. If this was 1.5 years ago I wouldn't have suggested this, but I do now.			"

												Let me say first that I started playing MWO about a year or so ago, and so far I got roughly 80 hourse playtime.Let's start with the two most common points of criticism for the game:1. MWO get's much hate because the developers did some really bad things in the past and were inconsistent about their development.2. MWO is based on the ""BattleTech"" book series. Many people expected (as was initially promised as far as I know) a game that is very similar to the mech battles in the books. That didn't completely work out though.So let's address these points:1. That was the past. Nowadays the developers are very open about the development, posting a kind of status report and roadmap monthly on the forums. They are listening more to what the players want now too. The development as it is now is quite good. As said, it's consistent, the devs aren't acting too much against the players desires and we get two patches, one a bit lighter and one more content-heavy, each month, steadily improving the game. PGI, the developers, are also not afraid to revisit and redo many ingame mechanics. 2. If you don't expect this game to be like the books or didn't even knew about the franchise before, you won't have any problems with this. I actually can't tell how different this is to the books as I simply don't think about it. I recognize BattleTech in this game, but there are also some differences to be noticed.In conclusion, development is fine today, and if you don't care about the books that's not a point of criticism either.Free to play, but is it pay to win?No. You can only use the premium currency MC to buy cosmetics, mechs and garage slots to have more mechs at the same time. Regarding the mech buying:You can buy every mech that is availabe for C-Bills, the ingame currency, with MC too to skip the grind.When new mechs are released, the first month or so they are available for MC only, after that for C-Bills too.But then, there are also hero mechs. Hero mechs can only ever be bought for MC. They are specially colored and maybe uniquely equipped variants of ""regular"" mechs. They have unique names and are well known from the books, but they aren't in any way OP. If you want to play an OP mech (lol) you will definitely find one available for C-Bills too. The grindIn the beginning you only have the trial mechs, which change every few weeks or months or so. Trial mechs are regular mechs which you can play without buying, but can't customize, so you're stuck with the standard loadout. As you don't own a mech yet, you have to play some trial-mech matches. The game will support you financially in the beginning by giving you extra money for every battle fought, for the first 25 battles or so. This will make you able to buy your own mech quickly. With the money earned in your next matches you will buy and try different kinds of equipment for your mech. After said first 25 matches though, money earning slows down a lot. You will get up to 200k C-Bills for very good matches and roughly 20k from bad ones. The cheapest mechs cost 1,5 mil, the most expensive ones cost 16 mil. Note that this is not just the chassis, but also motor, weapons, ammo, armor etc. so you can reuse most of the stuff you buy, but it still takes quite some time to make enough money to afford a new mech. Additionally, you will probably spend some millions on buying upgrades and equipment for your new mech. If you're like me, you will feel a bit shocked when you used up all of the initial money boost and begin to realize how much you actually need to buy a mech. This feeling will however go away after some time and it will feel really rewarding when you can finally buy a new mech or an expensive upgrade. Also, cheap mechs aren't bad. The price of a mech is just the sum of all of the equipment included in the initial loadout plus a bit extra for the chassis. Cheap mechs are light mechs. Light mechs can be just as enjoyable as the huge, hard-hitting but slow assault mechs, it's just personal preference and playstyle.Graphics are good, not staggering but a sudden laser cutting through the darkness looks really neat. Also, you really feel like in a mechpilots cockpit because of screen shake, red alarm lights and stuff.Sound is very good, each weapon type has it's own sounds and you can really feel the impacts of attacks on your armor. There's even a map without atmosphere where you can only hear your own movement and impacts on your armor, but nothing else from outside.All in all.. most of the criticism can be ignored, that really depends on yourself. As always with F2P games, just try it out. If you can get behind the initial confusion about the quite complex MWO and behind the trial mechs, get a mech you like and equip it how you want, you will have a really good time.			"

												I have been a Mechwarrior fan for years. While it has its issues, this is a very fun game to play with friends and with a unit. Beware dropping solo PUG can be brutal at times, however when you stick together it can be very rewarding. I have played this since closed beta and the game continues to morph, love the new content and looking forward to the CW phase 3 content. Pilot skill and teamwork all play a major factor. There are a lot of great units out there that you can join that are willing to help with the learning curve, I recommend finding one, they can help you with builds and tactics. There are a lot of Mech's and configurations to choose from. Enjoy! sparkomech66 - The Templars. We salute you. o7			"

												I'm playing MWO since it entered open Beta and I love it.I love collecting my mechs, I love tinkering with them in the Mechlab.The re-imagined/re-designed mechs are fantastic - for everyone who loves Battletech.PvP is way better than back in MW4.PvE is not yet included but the devs have stated they will add PvE as soon as possible.What I dislike is the ""balance"" between IS and Clans.Fights are always 12v12 - even in faction play, instead of 12v10 (3 IS Lances vs. 2 Clan Stars)So Clans always field two more mechs than they should lore-wise - the solution is to nerf their weaponry.Nevertheless the game is a lot of fun and even exotic builds can fit in, if you know what you are doing.It doesn't feel like a CoD or any other modern shooter, it feels more like Operation Flashpoint back in the days			"

												Going to preface this by saying I've been playing MWO for three years, and have played the table top for even longer, and I have no inclination to stop any time soon. NO PAY TO WIN.-Play with trial mechs.-Save your in game money. New players get a big bonus.-Take your time to pick a Battlemech. You'll need 3 variants of the same chasis to master it.-You can get a fully competitive battlemech for free.-Any Battlemech will do it fine,-This game is about fulfilling the role of your mech, not about collecting mechs.A VERY useful link:http://mwo.smurfy-net.de/(can i put this here?)Playing this from the begining.It's Free, be the judge, have Fun.EDIT: Props to carlhosen for summarizing this perfectly o7			"

												I bought a founder pack for this game when it first came out and, while fun, I never really got into that much. I kept coming back to it every now and again to see what progress they made but never stuck around for long.Now that the game has come out on Steam I've come back again and this time I think I can honestly say the game is in a state where it is thoroughly enjoyable. It still has problems though, and if you're a diehard fan of BattleTech and the old MechWarrior games there are a few changes that might annoy you.As for the business model, I personally think it's quite fair. You can buy every mech for in-game earned money (C-Bills), although new mechs are only available for real money for a while after their release. Honestly you never have to spend a dime in this game to enjoy it. When you first start you get a huge boost to your income for the first 30 games or so, so you can buy whatever mech you like pretty fast (at least I think that's still a thing, it was when I played a year or so ago). Once your starter bonus is up you still make money at a very fair rate, and since playing the game is actually very fun, time will fly so fast you'll suddenly realise you have heaps of cash to buy a new mech or new weapons or whatever you want.So yeah, I heartily recommend this game! :D			"

												First played this game as a stand alone, then installed it from steam.  So the number of hours played on steam is much lower than my actual time spent on this time waster.After playing 688 matches, owning 11 mechs, and mastering 6 of them, I feel I have wasted so much time.  Don't get me wrong, the graphics are great, and there is potental, but it really falls short.  It's nothing but a grind for better stuff, and when you finally max out that mech, you really have nothing to play for.  There is no way to win, no single player, no co-op missions, just grinding in pick-up matches.Oh you can try the faction play, but if you are not in a good clan you are wasting your time.I love the Mechwarrior series, and have played all of them.  But this is nothing but a money milking machine.  Sorry fans, just calling the kettle black here.			"

												I've played this game since open Beta and it's still just as awesome as when I played it for the first time :)To get the most from this game though, you need to  be able to work with your team. Try to be a ""call of duty"" warhero and charge head on into the enemy thinking you can manage on your own will result in you ending up dead very quickly.Comunicating thru VOIP or Teamspeak is essential as you need to concentrate several mechs fire on a single enemy mech to quickly take them out, which means calling targets is most important :)			"

												I enjoyed the hell out of this game and would recommend you at least try it, after all it is free-to-play and you really have nothing to lose. Mech prices and the fact their is no co-op or ""missions mode"" might throw off older fans, and free-to-players, looking for a more PvE experience; But what this game does, which is PvP, it does well. The controls have been slimmed up a bit but I find them more ""smoothed out"" then ""dumbed-down"". Anyways the bottomline is this: Try this game!			"

												-Was a founder and played a little bit early on but the game did not hold my attention alot then. I really wanted to like the game but something was holding me back. Once it came on steam though I have started getting into it more and sure the learning curve is steep (so prepare for watching many tutorials and reading many forum post) but once you start getting the hang of it and things click there are not many games that have you think about so many variable at once and I actually really like that.- Prepare your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for the first little bit as you learn the ins and outs and learn how and when to engage other pilots. -The trial mech system is a really great way for people to try out mech before they buy them. Even though you can't customize the Trial Mechs I like that you still earn xp on them so there is always something to gain from them.- As long as your doing at least something during the battle such as keeping missle locks on enemies or even staying in formation the game shall reward thee. The indicators for rewards is nice too and I think it helps foster better teamwork and there are many incentives to help even though lone wolfing is possible but deffinetly in a more anachronistic format that many of the other online battle game out there.- Most of your C-bills (earned in game currency) iss spent more on the equipment and module for mechs as apposed on the mechs themselves so getting lots of mech is pretty easier to do until you get to some of the later Assault mechs that can cost quite a bit.- Pretty fair buisiness model the main way they make money is similar to alot of other battle games such as Worl of Tanks or even Warframe where you do have to buy mech slots to house your mechs witrh realy money but have seen events and faction warfare rewards where they can be aquired which is always nice. But this leads to another pro and con about the game...- There are tons of mechs in this game and more get added pretty regularly so its alot of information to take in on alot of machines and they all need homes to stay in so that where your mech bays come in handy.- Unlike WOT or Warframe though you are not super rewared for selling your mechs since each are an asset on their own and all of them are very well crafted so you can develop quite the connection with some of them since they all look and play very differently.Thats all I got for now but for a Free to Play it  scratches many itches for me currently and I think there are many people who would enjoy the quality and variety this game offers.

												MWO is simply a great game that has improved tremendously over the years.  I've been playing MWO since its closed beta, and it has always had great combat and customization.  In the beginning there were a very limited amount of mechs to play, but over the last few years they have increased it to the point where there is a huge selection of mechs available for every role and tonnage.  If you have ever wanted to play a game where you controlled a walking tank with huge firepower in PvP, this is your game.  Regardless of your play style, whether it be fast twitch or slow tanky, this game has you covered.A few small tips for new players:1. Use the new tutorial!  Seriously, this game has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of buttons and complexity.  HIGHLY recommended!  PGI has outdone themselves making it as well.2. If you ignored No. 1, use R to spot targets for your team.  If the triangle is full, you are sharing that info with your team.  Hollow triangles mean nobody has them locked!3. TORSO TWIST.  Seriously, try to spread the damage you are taking as much as possible.  Not only does it keep you alive, but it also stops you from having parts of your mech blown off.4. If playing a light mech, NEVER STOP MOVING.  The only exception is if you are behind an enemy mech lining up a shot and NOBODY knows you are there.  Seriously, your armor is made of paper, so speed is your only defense.  That being said, light mechs are still ridiculously good.  5. For the first 25 games you play or so, you will earn a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of cbills.  I highly suggest that you try to figure out what your play style is with the trial mechs before you buy anything.  As far as your first purchase, I personally feel that the clan ""omni-mechs"" are the best investment.  You can outfit a single omni-mech for pretty much any type of weapon mix because you can change their weapon hardpoints by swapping torso pieces.   I  suggest the Arctic Chetah, Stormcrow, Timberwolf, or Dire Wolf as a beginner omni-mech for those respective classes.  For non-omni mechs I suggest the Jenner / Raven, Hunchback / Crab, Grasshopper / Cataphract, or King Crab / Atlas.Keep up the great work PGI,Phantom LeaderLegendary FounderP.S. I have hundreds of hours in this game, hell maybe thousands by now.   "

												Probably the best team-based MMO out there, in my opinion.Whether you're a Battletech lore fan or not, this game is a must try if you like team based tactics. There are no solo-heroes in this game. You either win as a team, or die as individuals.If you like the pace of Call of Duty, this is not the game for you. Take the time to learn your style, and modify your mechs to your play style. Make every drop count, be the best you can be, and see you on the Battlefield.			"

												You'll see alot of people whining about this game saying it's not like mechwarrior, or it's a cash grab. It is indeed Mechwarrior and it's alot of fun. The game can be a bit grindy especially if you don't put a small amount of money into it,Premium time is where it's at to get credits. The hero/champion mechs aren't broken or OP you just get more money/xp and hard points ooo wippity doooo. The game itself is great there are alot of mechs to use, not to mention a decent chunk on trial. You should only buy a mech when you think you like it and want to customize the loudout and camos and paint. The faction play is also pretty awesome it's a unique way to get into a team based shooter. I'd say the main probelms with this game are the intense amount of time it takes to grind if you're a free player, Sometimes you will get mercilessly stomped by a clan in faction play while you're with a bunch of randoms, and the lack of costumization options without using real money as well. But paying to look pretty isn't pay to win, or a reason to stay away from this game. Like come on people do you expect every f2p game to just give you a full game experience? The people who make games need to make money too. I'm tired of people whining and complaining because you can buy this or that in f2p games . This game has a great community and decent VOIP built into it as well. 90% of the people who use it are very nice and helpful, you'll run into a toxic player here and there but that's the internet fo you. Out of all of the f2p games on steam I'd reccomend this one to anyone who likes giant robots or games where teamwork and coordination are required. 9/10 Big Robot Peneee			"

												Pro: Free, fun gameplay that is tactical and varied, with lots of customisations. If you act before you think, you end up badly hurt or chosing the next drop. Let us not forget that, to quote some, GIANT STOMPY ROBOTS!Con: Still has some bugs and developement is not fast compared to some games due to lack of manpower, needs more maps as well and more game modes. Needs better documentation for new players. The grind could be a bit steep for some (though those that play LoL and the likes are used to the grind)I play MWO casually due to real-life obligations, and it has been the case since closed beta. I tried it, liked it, got the base founder package (all I could budget). Since then I got some MC, and felt compelled to get the Marrauder package. I am not great skill-wize, but I still find enjoyment. A lot of things you buy can be had from events, especially if you spend a lot of time and become skilled. The cons list might be bigger then the pros, but it is still FUN, and most cons will be progressively ironed out eventualy.There are some that will say this is the worse game ever (but still play) and those that say it is the best game ever and defend it al all cost. The truth is always in the middle; I just take it as it is and enjoy it for what it is: a game fun at its core ever progressing and getting better. It is not perfect, but no one or nothing on this planet is.Enjoy.			"

												I won't really be able to add a lot that hasn't already been said in other reviews, but here's my 2 cents...I've been playing MWO since early 2013. I know there are many players who've played from the start, but this is the only ""MMO"" game I've stuck with. EVE online is the only other one that compelled me to really gave it a chance with, but after a month I was done for several reasons. Mostly, I just wasn't having fun.MWO on the other hand has been my go to game since I started playing it. I don't play daily(except during my vacations), but I do play several hours a day on my weekends. and more importantly, I look forward to playing every single week. The only other game that can say that for me is XCOM(and hopefully XCOM 2). I can either sit down and play 3 hours of matches without a break, or play 1-2, take a break/eat/deal with the kids/etc.. the play some more. Or, I can just spend time in the mech lab trying out different configs and builds.voice/text chat during matches is, for the vast majority of the time, pleasant and good natured. Of course there is always ""that guy"" on occasion, but that's the exception, not the rule. forum wise, the community is VERY passionate. the can and will debate over what to an outsider seems like a very trivial matter to someone outside the community. size of hit boxes, XL vs standard engines in certain mechs, scale, the merit of weapon types, and on and on and on... Is there toxic players/posters? yes. just like in all games. and unfortunately that passion the community has can make for some very disgruntled players who are upset over things that happened long ago. sometimes they have a valid point. too often a minor thing is turned into a conspiracy theory based on nothing but their feels.which brings me to PGI. stellar company? no. to be frank, they REALLY messed up and tripped coming out of the gate at the start of development. VERY bad balance choices that took them far too long to correct. poor communication. poor feed back. over promising. unrealistic  release dates. poor marketing choices. rushed clan mechs. and so on. having said that, ditching IGP really helped clear up a lot of those problems. and in the last year and a half VAST improvements in those categories have been made. My only real issue at the moment is that it still feels like new features are talking too long to implement(looking at you CW phase 3).But having said all that, the important thing is gameplay. gameplay trumps all else in my opinion, and as I said, this is the game I keep coming back to week after week. and that's all that matters to me.so to sum up my opinion on MWO...It's a F2P game, that's not pay to win, has a pretty decent community barring a few individuals, is still being developed(even if I wish it was quicker about that) good graphics for what it is, immersive, and most importantly...it's fun. I recommend you give it a shot and see if you like it. after all, it's free.			"

Trial mechs are regular mechs which you can play without buying, but can't customize, so you're stuck with the standard loadout. As you don't own a mech yet, you have to play some trial-mech matches. The game will support you financially in the beginning by giving you extra money for every battle fought, for the first 25 battles or so. This will make you able to buy your own mech quickly. With the money earned in your next matches you will buy and try different kinds of equipment for your mech. After said first 25 matches though, money earning slows down a lot. You will get up to 200k C-Bills for very good matches and roughly 20k from bad ones. The cheapest mechs cost 1,5 mil, the most expensive ones cost 16 mil. Note that this is not just the chassis, but also motor, weapons, ammo, armor etc. so you can reuse most of the stuff you buy, but it still takes quite some time to make enough money to afford a new mech. Additionally, you will probably spend some millions on buying upgrades and equipment for your new mech. If you're like me, you will feel a bit shocked when you used up all of the initial money boost and begin to realize how much you actually need to buy a mech. This feeling will however go away after some time and it will feel really rewarding when you can finally buy a new mech or an expensive upgrade. Also, cheap mechs aren't bad. The price of a mech is just the sum of all of the equipment included in the initial loadout plus a bit extra for the chassis. Cheap mechs are light mechs. Light mechs can be just as enjoyable as the huge, hard-hitting but slow assault mechs, it's just personal preference and playstyle.Graphics are good, not staggering but a sudden laser cutting through the darkness looks really neat. Also, you really feel like in a mechpilots cockpit because of screen shake, red alarm lights and stuff.Sound is very good, each weapon type has it's own sounds and you can really feel the impacts of attacks on your armor. There's even a map without atmosphere where you can only hear your own movement and impacts on your armor, but nothing else from outside.All in all.. most of the criticism can be ignored, that really depends on yourself. As always with F2P games, just try it out. If you can get behind the initial confusion about the quite complex MWO and behind the trial mechs, get a mech you like and equip it how you want, you will have a really good time.			"

												Great game, you can buy experience point boost, but you can't buy experience.  There have been regular events in beta where you can win/earn MC (the points you buy with real moneys), and you can't buy an advantage.  Beginner players without a group can expect their life to be ""nasty, brutish, and short"", but it's all about the team play.  Stick together and you increase your chances of survival immensely.  It takes time to accumulate enough to buy a decent set of mechs, and even longer to get them tweaked to the point of usefullness.  There is a wealth of information in the forums to give more than adequate guidance as your play style develops.  The community is vast, diverse, and deep.My wife HATES this game: 10/10			"

												I've recently started playing and am finding the game to have a lot more depth than similar titles (like world of tanks, world of warships etc.), with just as much if not more room for progression. Certainly mastering every mech chassis and finding optimal builds that work for you on all of them would take a long time. From what I've seen the c-bill (currency earned in game) variants of mechs are at least competitive with, if not better than the mechs you can only buy with real money. As such the only thing you ever 'need' to buy are mech bays, though if you're putting in enough time to get the c-bills for that many mechs (and equiprment) then putting a little money in is fairly reasonable. If you are going to spend real money then the steam dlc 'mech performance packs' aren't the best idea - you only get one mech chassis variant of each type so you'd need to spend quite a lot of time getting the money for two more variants as you need to own three in order to master a chassis, which you'd definitely want to be doing. For my money I'd get a mastery pack for MC (the premium currency) which you can see in-game.Certainly the game is worth downloading and trying; there's a whole lot of content on offer, most of which you can get without spending anything if you're willing to put in the time.

												I am a long time Founder, and I love this game.  I wish I had time to be better at it, as it does take time to be a top tier player.  There is a lot of really negative nonsense out there.  Dont belive it.  Yes there were some major issues in the PAST.  But in the last 2 years PGI has really stepped up, and the game gets better and better with every release.  And after the Steam Release Party, it lookslike its going to get so much better!Big Stompy Robots, and a thinking man's shooter that is as close as your going to get to a real mech sim.  Give it a go.....ITS FREE!  And if you like it, you can drop a few bucks on cool visual upgrades.Have fun!			"

												Have you played Call of Duty, or Battlefield and had a great time?  Are you prone to lone wolf tactics?  Can you take down the entire enemy team on your own armed with nothing but a knife?  Then this is not the game for you.  Mechwarrior is for thinkers, not twich gamers.  Gamers who need to consider everything around them, and take decisive action.  Mistakes are very costly, losing armor, or weapons systems can break you.  You have to consider your role, and work well with a team in order to succeed.The team at Pirhana Games has created a wonderful interpretation of the Battletech universe.  No, it's not much like the tabletop, but it's certainly no HAWKEN.  MWO is closer to a mech sim than a FPS, with localized damage, tonnage and ammo requirements, no respawning, and slow paced tactical combat.  Driving these mechs makes you feel the weight of a multi ton killing machine.  The impact of missiles and autocannon rounds is visceral and makes you seek cover when they hit.  The victories are sweet, just as the defeats can be crushing, but always satisfying and fun.  If you like World of Tanks, you'll like MWO.  If you like COD, go play HAWKEN or Titanfall for some sweet mech action.			"

												I don't know how to write a review.Pros:Quite funFreeEasy to pick up, and put downYou can try out virtually every mech via 'trial' periodVery solid hit detectionOptional 3rd personLook pretty goodCons:Sometimes matches take a few minutes to find/startNo map in 3rd personSpecial mech variants can only be purchased through microtransactions (which honestly isn't even a big deal. You can customize the base models enough to probably match them)Slightly repetitive (It's a shooter. If you don't like shooters, this isn't for you)All in all, this game is a great game to play when you're bored, or don't know what to do. Between matches you can spend currency to upgrade or tweak your mech. Each mech gets a certain weight cap, and from there you can install weapons, alter your armor on each individual part (Front AND back armor), and install different modules like heat sinks. The tutorial gives you quite a decent amount of money, giving you the ability to get a decent selection of mechs. The game even lets you test out almost every mech to see what you like, and what your play style is. Be it a heavy laser sniper mech, or a light mech that can run circles around the heavies should you be able to get close enough. People seem to say it's pay to win, but I don't really see that. I've played about.. 15+ matches, some lost, some won. I can't give a completely fair opinion on this, due to me not being out of 'noob' stage. There also seems to be a lot of people saying there's a huge learning curve. I don't see that either. Your legs don't face the way you're aiming, but that took a whole 5 minutes to get used to. You don't stop on a dime, and turning takes a second, but once you get past that it's a shooter. You can either try to be precise and aim for specific parts on the enemy mech, or just go all out and fire untill they die. Be warned, you get one life per match. If you die, and quit the match, you'll still get credit. If you quit, you will be unable to use the mech you had in the match untill it's over, though you can still use other mechs in the mean time.TL;DRGame good. Game free. Good for boredom fixes.			"

												I am a founder.  I bought the mid-tier founders pack and have not regretted it.  The first year was a bit rocky, but through it all, PGI has done all it can to bring the best sim game the Mechwarrior franchise has seen.  I loved all the other titles, but this is the closest to balanced as any Mechwarrior has been.  PGI has not taken all the suggestions they have received and implemented them (the other founders that are crying and putting up negative reviews are doing so because of this.  Entitlement at it's finest lol), but they have implemented many of them, and even improved on some of those recommendations.  Overall, the game has been good enough for me to buy well over $1000 on mech packs and MC, and there are many many others out there that are like me.  Though you may see many negative reviews from some of the founders, understand they are truly the vocal minority.  They just happen to be the loudest, and worst part of this community.There is no PTW, 99.9% of all mechs are purchasable with in game funds, the hero mechs only truly supply you with a faster way to earn those funds, and level the mech slightly faster.  The only pay is for convenience.  You pay to get more money and xp faster, or like me, you pay to help the Devs continue on their recent successful path.  There truly is no end game mech, every mech is viable until you get to tier 1 where you do have to know the meta to compete with some of the best this game has to offer, but for those of us who play for fun, we can build some really wonky mechs that still win. The devs have continued with the development of this game, and with the upcoming release of community warfare 3, and little perks like decals, and updated mechlab, it looks to only get better. If you enjoy stompy robot games, FPS' that are slower and more thought out than CoD, and even better, enjoy joining clans, MWO is a great game to try. "

												It could have been great but the whole game is set to get you to spend real world money. It's a constant grinding game for little to no reward. Think you can recreate your favorite mechs from previous games? Too bad, you're stuck with whatever weapons and allowments the designers offered. Forget changing engines, armor or even many weapons on a clan mech or adding AMS or such. Never been so disappointed with any mechwarrior game.			"

												Let me start this review by saying that I have never played a Mech Warrior game before, so I am writing this as someone who does not know any of the lore or design choices and i'm just a filthy casual after some enjoyable gameplay.Pros * Free to play game* The only multiplayer mech game out there for mech fans right now(?)* The community generally seems pretty friendly & a lot of people use voice comms* Different game modes depending on how seriously you want to take it* A lot of customisation of mechs & their loadouts* Battles can be intense & rewarding if you do well / work as a team* A high skill capCons * Extremely sloooow paced game.  Want to play a quick casual with a friend?  Depending on the day & time you're playing (and if the Americans are awake yet) you could be in a queue for 3+ minutes. Then you need to wait for the loading screen to vote on the map & gameplay mode... Then you need to wait for another loading screen to go into a lobby with 24 other people who have inevitably gone off to make a cup of tea / finish the washing up / do the weekly shop while they wait to get into a game - and you have to wait for every single one of those 24 players to press ready or wait for the timer to run down...  Then you get another loading screen to watch essentially another loading screen where your mech is dropped onto the planet...  Then you get to walk across the map for 2 to 3 minutes in your mech (or wait for the other larger & slower mechs to move into position).  All this for probably about 5 to 10 minutes of gameplay if you are lucky* Not being able to access any other part of the game while searching for a game is frustrating, you are forced to sit looking at a searching message rather than being able to check out possible upgrades in the shop or mech loadouts etc* The menu layouts, sub options etc are all extremely confusing & poorly laid out.  I realise that part of this is due to the sheer amount of options the game has, but I can't help but feel a lot of this is down to poor choice & design on the developers part as well* And the real killer is the grind.  The game does a good job at the start of rewarding new players with a lot of in-game currency for completing certain achievements - this then allows them to purchase a mech or two and get a few of the upgrades for that ship.  Great!  Now you'll want to start levelling the skills up for that mech, no no no, you need to purchase & level up another 2 slightly different variants of the same mech you've already purchased!  This inevitably means you'll need to spend a lot more of those precious space bucks & that you will also need to use another two of your very limited spaces garages to hold the ships (and guess what garage spaces cost space bucks).  You also then need to play the two weaker (or less interesting) variants of that ship to the same level as the one you are interested in to unlock the next skill trees, and then repeat the same process of grinding up more experience on all three mechs. You'll also want to upgrade that ship with better engine parts or modules - some more space bucks needed, which are now being earnt extremely slowly since you completed all the starting objectives.  Well you better dedicate your life to this game or be willing to spend some serious real-cash money if you want to play more than a couple of different variants of mechs, which bring me onto the next point* The cost of the in-game purchases is ridiculous for what you actually get, they do put special deals on for certain mechs which change regularly, but wow, it really does seem expensive for what you getConclusion This isn't a bad game, in fact it can be quite intense & enjoyable in the right company & when you finally get into a game and do well, but it's pretty clear after a while that the developers are trying to fleece people who enjopy it / are interested in Mech games & have no other real options.I realise it is free to play, and I purchased a mech or two at the start of the game as I wanted to contribute towards the game that I was enjoying (as I have done for other F2P games such as League of Legends), but you could sink literally 1000s of pounds into this game, and I have a feeling that they prey on people who are willing to do this due to their personality traits & previosuly stated lack of options for Mech games elsewhere.

												I've been playing from alpha.If you are looking for great team based mech combat based in the battletech franchise - this IS it.If you are looking for the above coupled within the battletech social/political space - this is NOT it. I had a much longer review typed out and accidentaly hit the back key on my mouse button, so I'll summarize...The game is fun, and only a few of your L337 FPS skills are going to transfer over. Its going to take a great deal of time to master your piloting and build your arsenal al la carte.Have fun, but remember that the game will be pretty stagnant within a years time if the developers don't pull yon head from dark hole and make faction/house/clan/merc warfare a MEANINGFUL part of the game. Right now its just a short lobby-drop grind for c-bills and xp (quick match) or a little longer grind for c-bills and xp (faction warfare) and thats absolutely it. The social aspect of the game is completely non-existant except for calling out spotting intel and coordination while in combat. Yes you can group with friends - no you can't do anything meaningful within a company or within the faction warfare system. Again, there are no in-game tools or perks to promote anything within this games socio-political space.There are no tools in game that would support a player driven company be it mercs/clans or house military. There is no trading of mechs or c-bills. There are no decisions on repair costs. Your only decision is how to outfit your mech, who to group up with, and how to click the ready button.Now thats not to say the devs have not been working on improving the game beyond what we have now. Hopefully we'll get some perks for faction warfare as it relates to taking defending and holding territory at the faction level (including merc allegiances). Hopefully we get some social tools to promote clan/guild/merc/house military development. Hopefully at some point I can promote or demote someone within my company and set their weekly pay accordingly, which is not tied to some silly rank/achievment system. hopefully we get an ARENA with some commentator tools along with prizes and ladders.However I won't hold my breath on that last block of text. I will however pony up 25k in real hard cash for the first mechwarrior 12 vs 12 tournament in the Solaris arena and get my buddy Deman to commentate the ladder match during a live stream. We need commentator spectator tools/cameras though.Now go read the second sentence of this review.			"

												There is a lot of potential in this game, but it's pretty inaccessable to new players. I'd be interested in spending some money on this game but the content is so shallow yet complicated. Pros: -Great Mech designs. -great fundamental concepts like the ""information warfare"" and the different uses for each mech weight class.-Potential for awesome cooperation between players,-Free to pay but not pay to win. (a rare treat)Cons:-Inaccessable. Its so difficult to know some of the basics and meta unless you dig around the internet.-There is a lot of grinding to do just to aquire fundamental features. Supposedly I can only enjoy the game after aquiring these time consuming features, but why would I bother if spending the time to get them is so booring and long.-The turning mechanics are suprisingly amateurish in how they are animated. -Mech customization is supposed to be a fundamental and fun feature of the game, but it too takes too much time and money to be fun.No fluff! No lore! In a Mechwarrior game!			"

												This is the most immersive game I've ever played and that's why it's my favorite.  It's true that the learning curve is huge, but if the idea of combat from the cockpit of a giant walking tank sounds fun, you should try it.  Give it 2 weeks, because it takes a long time to learn how to be successful.  Do the tutorial until you get the movement and targeting down.  Don't play with real opponents until you've done that.  Join a unit like DHB (deathshandbrigade.net) or the BeerWarriors (beerwarriors.net), get on their TeamSpeak server and ask any questions you may have.  Both groups have nice guys to help you be successful.  Don't be discouraged.  It IS a pretty hard game to learn but can be completely free, if you want it to be.  You can win free mechbays during contests, but it might be worth buying the smallest MC pack for $8 and using it on mechbays.  I hope you keep playing and that I see you in-game.			"

												I started the game recently and I have to honestly say, it's amazing. You would think it's some cheesy lame mecha game with poor mechanics from past experience like Robotech or Hawken but nope. It's in a tier of it's own. The game is very in depth down to the build of your mech as well as role in a battle and different types of weaponry. Faction play also encourages you to make friends pretty easily! I can honestly give this game a 9/10 stars. There's a small learning curve in the beginning but once you get used to it, you'll stay up all night playing this game while avoiding homework!			"

												I've been playing from alpha.If you are looking for great team based mech combat based in the battletech franchise - this IS it.If you are looking for the above coupled within the battletech social/political space - this is NOT it. I had a much longer review typed out and accidentaly hit the back key on my mouse button, so I'll summarize...The game is fun, and only a few of your L337 FPS skills are going to transfer over. Its going to take a great deal of time to master your piloting and build your arsenal al la carte.Have fun, but remember that the game will be pretty stagnant within a years time if the developers don't pull yon head from dark hole and make faction/house/clan/merc warfare a MEANINGFUL part of the game. Right now its just a short lobby-drop grind for c-bills and xp (quick match) or a little longer grind for c-bills and xp (faction warfare) and thats absolutely it. The social aspect of the game is completely non-existant except for calling out spotting intel and coordination while in combat. Yes you can group with friends - no you can't do anything meaningful within a company or within the faction warfare system. Again, there are no in-game tools or perks to promote anything within this games socio-political space.There are no tools in game that would support a player driven company be it mercs/clans or house military. There is no trading of mechs or c-bills. There are no decisions on repair costs. Your only decision is how to outfit your mech, who to group up with, and how to click the ready button.Now thats not to say the devs have not been working on improving the game beyond what we have now. Hopefully we'll get some perks for faction warfare as it relates to taking defending and holding territory at the faction level (including merc allegiances). Hopefully we get some social tools to promote clan/guild/merc/house military development. Hopefully at some point I can promote or demote someone within my company and set their weekly pay accordingly, which is not tied to some silly rank/achievment system. hopefully we get an ARENA with some commentator tools along with prizes and ladders.However I won't hold my breath on that last block of text. I will however pony up 25k in real hard cash for the first mechwarrior 12 vs 12 tournament in the Solaris arena and get my buddy Deman to commentate the ladder match during a live stream. We need commentator spectator tools/cameras though.Now go read the second sentence of this review.			"

												Pros:- this really is free-to-play and definitely NOT pay-to-win. Most mechs are purchasable with c-bills which you can earn in-game, and the few 'premium-only mechs are not necessarily 'better' than the non-premium ones (but they do offer a bonus to in-game currency earned in matches). Most of the premium-only items in the game are either cosmetic or boost the rate at which you can earn in-game currency; additional mechbays are an exception, but the 4 you start with are plenty until you want to start building a large mech collection.- the game is very generous for new players. Just completing the tutorials gives you a load of c-bills, while the cadet bonuses from your 1st 25 matches should get you enough to buy any mech in the game (apart from the premium variants mentioned above).- huge range of customisable mechs to buy (in 4 classes light,medium, heavy and assault). The game also has a selection of trial mechs in each class that you can use for free (but you can't customise these) - this allows new players to get a feel for the different weight classes before buying their 1st mech (tip: don't do what I did and spend your cadet bonus before being absolutely sure what type of mech suits you).- lots of mech customisation options (but these may seem complex/baffling for anyone not familiar with mechwarrior games).- the visuals and audio do a great job in making the mechs feel authentic- the matchmaking system attempts to match newer players with other players of the same level of experience- fairly friendly community overallCons:- huge learning curve for anyone not familiar with the mechwarrior universe.- the basic tutorials are not really sufficient to prepare new players for the online battlefields, so new players may get frustrated at having to learn to play the hard way.- there is no option to practice against AI mechs, which would help to alleviate the point above. There is an option to wander around empty battlefields to familiarise yourself with the maps, but I suspect that a lot of new players will quickly get get bored with this, if they choose to do it at all.- despite the attempt to match new players with others of similar experience, a lot of matches seem to be quite unbalanced and I can see that this could put off many new players.

												The base of this game is too much for any mechanical fanatic to pass up, I mean really; Mechs in an unyielding grudgematch to the death( or until an objective is met) but mostly death.Pros: For starters, it fulfilled my childhood dreams of crushing enemies with mechs, but more than that it allows a variety of mechs to be used.  Trial mechs are offered in the beginning under each different class to give the player a chance at the magnitude of styles for all areas of the game.  Making money for an owned mech is easy in the beginning, and I had myself 15,000,000 in-game money before I knew it.  Its combat system is also a quick breeze to understand, and you can adjust you weapons to fire in unison or diversify the artillery under different buttons.  The wisest move behind it all is the tutorial, seeing as it states everything you need to know to jump into the game after its completion.Cons: As figured from a game like this, there is another sort of in-game money that costs real money to earn, but the matches aren't any better behind a mech bought with only that money.  The game does its best to keep a balance for new and older players all in a while making sure the bought money is only a shortcut, not just an enhancer.  As I said earlier, makingmoney is easy AT FIRST, but consequentally after so much your income after each match drops to you putting alot of effort just to afford another mech.  I can't say that the premium in this game gives much moe, but a 50% bonus isn't too bad.  The mech-anics(see that there) are like controlling any other rust bucket, but I do Wonder why there wasn't any tread-legs added( just a personal hope).			"

												Theres a chance you might of tried this game. launched into the first few matches and got your♥♥♥♥♥handed to in every single one. Think of this game as a live action gameboard and not as a fast pace mech on mech combat. (like hawken)This game truly tests your patience and your decision making, especially when it comes to customizing what weapons and equipment you want to have on a certain mech and which playstyle it will perform better as.To cut it to the bare bones, the game is very difficult to master and the prices are a bit steep heading towards alpine peakshowever its not necessary to put ANY money into this game, and if you plan to do so, just having Premium for the extra C bills [the main in game currency] bonus WILL stack up nicely over time.check out my boi Kanajashi who did a Free-To-Play run from the starting Tier 5 to Tier 2http:// https://youtu.be/1aPXoJDAKD4?list=PLEc0AL2THTbdzdk12F5HMHAfkW7i3ggw2every information he shares is very helpful and will help you get better at the game and enjoy the game without any risk for your wallet.this is a team based game, where information is a powerful weapon and communication is key to organize formations and focusing targets to get much more fair and enjoyable games (especially if the enemy team has tier 1 Twitch streamers and Youtube Stars getting wrecked)with that said. grab a buddy, learn to get good and enjoy the game. Heres a few links that features useful stuff that will get you a better idea of what mechs are averaged to have better performance based on thier user friendlines and average DPS they can dish out.http://metamechs.com/mwo-tier-lists/meta-tier-list/ "

												-What's interesting about this game?-It's an FPS game with technological stuff like lasers, long range guided missiles, huge cannons etc... but its certainly not like other FPS games. First, it's not really easy to destroy mechs so, you can lose your leg, arm, or side torso and you can still keep fighting. Then, there is lots of customization stuff so you can find the playstyle that fits you, for example if you like fast-paced playing or scout style playing you can try lighter mechs or if you prefer slow but powerful stuff, you can try heavier mechs. Lastly, if you played any other Mechwarrior game and liked it, you should definitely try this.-Is it p2w? are there any imba stuff?-Although there are things that cause imbalanced gameplay, p2w ain't one of them. and they are making (nearly) every effort to minimize these differences. So, feel free to count this game as one of the fully f2p games. Note, that you might say that they restrict the starting mech bays which you can buy mechs in to 4 but you can gain new mechbays for playing in ""faction play"" mode or in most weekend events. and even those pretty looking mech designs aren't too far away, they are giving colors and mc away in those events too, so you can customize your battlemechs.-how about community?-I played MWO for years (before steam) and i rarely stumbled open people who curse, swear, etc... plus if you need any help, people really are very eager to help you. (even if they don't help you out in game, you can try forums http://mwomercs.com/forums/ )-Lastly, things that new players should be careful about:*Weapon Ranges: Always check your weapon ranges at the start of a match (lower right corner). And you can find distance of your targer just right of your targeting reticle, so if it shows 400 meter, don't shoot your 200 meter short lasers, they will do reduced damage beyond their max range (0 at double range).Note: normal PPCs have minimimum range of 90, they don't do damage below that range. Note: LRMs have 180 minimum range, c-LRMs do reduced damage below 180*Servers: Between ""Faction Play"" and ""Quick Play"" button there's an arrow that lets you choose the server to play the game, choose the one with the lowest ping *Teamplay: Stick with your team, you'll live longer and do more damage.*Buying Mechs: Before you buy mechs, build your mech in this site http://mwo.smurfy-net.de , and then if it fits you, buy it.

												I've put hundreds of hours into Battlefield 3 and 4... and I quit them for this game :-)played MWO since it came out moar than 3 years ago and I'm still at it almost every night. as an Elite Founder of this game, I've seen it go through a lot of ups and downs and I'm really happy about the present state and where the game is headed. spending a small amount is enough to get you all set for the first year or so. the Mastery Packs yield tremendous value for money. you should pick up MechBay deals when they become available and dont waste your precious MCs on buying mech chassis. spend real money only on mastery packs, mech bays, and a few camo and color schemes. forget the rest of the bling. you can get by with the grind, its not that hard. I hated WOT grinds, this is far sensible. TLDR: this is not pay to win. its pay a little, pay what you want, grind for the rest. the GAME BALANCE is excellent!As a battletech nut since 1988, I've played it all on the PC, SNES, Virtual Worlds, Clix, CCG, and Tabletop. this is how I visualize mech combat!

												Simply the best mech sim out there! There is nothing close to it. It captures all of the mechanics of the board game as well as all of it's predecessors since the first VGA came out in 1985. Mechwarrior is the cumilation of decades of perfection, like a samurai sword it has been folded hundreds of times, it is razor sharp and eternal, never rusting, never giving ground to noobs and neophytes. This game is amazing, easy to learn, difficult to master. Many people with low IQ will find this game frustrating since it requires intelligence as well as skill and tactical teamwork. If you are stupid, then stay away from this game because it is beyond your abilities. However, if you are intelligent, then welcome to the thinking man's shooter!			"

												Disregard my time played: I've been with this game since launch about 2 years ago, and have sunk hundreds of hours into it.Right, so, where to begin...As soon as the game came out, I was instantaneously disappointed. I, and a lot of other fans of the BattleTek and MW franchise wanted Mechwarrior 5.This is, by no means, Mechwarrior 5.Go google Mechwarrior: Living Legends. THAT, is what MW5 should have been like.*Ahem*Anywho, so, yes, this is not the game we wanted, however it is a pretty decent game in it's own rights.Prior to the steam release, the game was much, much more P2W.You used to make 20-30k cbills a match, maybe 50k if you were good. That meant it took eons to save up for mechs you could ""easily"" just buy with cash. There were also a lot of mech variants that were marginally better, that were only available for cash. I played it anyway cause, hey, Mechwarrior.Now that it's on steam, it's roughly 200% better in my opinion. I get minimum 100k cbills a match (even if I lose), and up to 400k if I have a good run. That's quite a bit more, and allows me to play around with my loadouts, and get more mechs sooner. Makes the game much less of a grind.So, would I recommend?6 months ago: No.Now: YES.Here's some tips for new players:DO NOT WASTE YOUR STARTING CBILLS ON AN 11MIL ASSAULT MECH. Go for something cheaper, so you still have room to mess with the loadout. People always choose the assault mechs, such as the Atlas, because they look bada$$, are freakin huge, and look like they could just tank and destroy everyone.If you believe that, prepare to be let down. Even the mighty Atlas or Direwolf are not tanks. Go with a light mech if you prefer a faster, hit and run/bugger the heck out of the enemy playstyle, or a medium or possibly heavy if you prefer more of a DPS/somewhat-tanking role.DO YOUR RESEARCHThe first mech I bought was a Banshee variant. Was about 8mil cbills if I recall. Thing looked like it could pack quite a bit of power in and seemed well armoured.After purchasing, I realized it only had Laser hardpoints. Not  bad thing in of itself, but for a tanking mech like that, all-laser builds do not fare very well. No matter what build I tried, I never found one that i was satisfyed with. So I sold it.SELLING A MECH GETS YOU ROUGHLY 1/4-1/2 THE CBILLS BACK. So make sure you research the mech you're interested in, look up builds, because choosing the wrong mech can be costly.DON'T EVERYONE BE AN LRM BOAT. An LRM boat is a mech that holds only, or mostly LRM's (long-range missiles). Yes, they're fantastic for surpressing the enemy or providing extra support to the front line mechs, but I've been seeing more and more matches recently with 6-7 (out of 12 total teammates) Maddogs or Catapults (clan and IS lrm boats). As you can imagine, having the majority of your team be artillary does not work very well. PICK A MECH AND STICK WITH IT. This goes along with what I said earlier, but it adds more. Staying with one mech will benefit you much more than having a load of them. Once you learn how to play a mech, and play it well, and create your perfect loadout, the game gets 1000% more fun. Seriously. Once you get your insanely fast light mech and start running around the enemies shredding the armour and destroying them, or once you get your beefy assault/heavy mech and partake in glorious close-mid range all out brawls? That's where this game shines. I found my perfect mech a couple weeks ago, the Arctic Cheeta ACH-B.Got my perfect loadout, and I've maxed out it's efficiencies. Even though I've now nothing to work towards with it (nothing to unlock for it), just messing about with different loadouts is fun. And playing the thing? It's fantastic, I love the hit and run style it allows for.GAME DOESN'T RUN WELL? You see those minimum specs down there? Disregard them. You see those recommended specs down there? Disregard them too. I run an FX-6300, 6 core, OC'd to 4.1ghz, R9 270x 2gb (slightly better than a GTX 750ti), 16 gb 1600mhz ram, and an SSD, displaying to a 1920x1080 monitor. I average 50-60 fps, drop down to 30-40 when it hits the fan. On low graphics. Now, imo, the game looks the same on all graphic settings, so I highly suggest you just go with minimal graphics. This is one of those games where 30 and sometimes even sub 30 FPS is playable, however, if you play a light mech, you need the fastest response time you can get, so 60 FPS would be best.USE VOICE COMMS. AGAIN, USE. VOICE. COMMS.Play a match where your team just communicates with text chat, or not at all, to a game where your team talks with VOIP, and you'll see a large difference. When VOIP comes in to play, that's when the real fun happens. Tactics, strategy, mid-game banter with your 'mates. The community is quite friendly from what I've seen too, I've never had a bad 'mate on VOIP. Even if only to say ""Assault lance advanding delta 6"" or such every so often, use voice comms. It makes the match so, so much better.I hope this review and some of these tips helped you, and I'm glad to see new players to this game from steam!Have a good one, and happy hunting.			"

												This game has come a LONG way since it's humble beta back in ~2013, when I last played. There's still work to be done, but the developers continually endeavor to squash bugs, improve balancing (an endless battle in and of itself) and add new content. As a ""new"" player coming into a game that's been out for a while, I didn't feel hamstrung by my lack of kit versus the more established players. I was able to drop right in and make a difference. As a ""free to play"" game, there are of course microtransactions - but I feel it is very well balanced and not at all pay to win. While you can skip ahead to the best mechs and fitments by throwing money around, winning will always come down to player experience and teamwork in the field. You don't have to spend a single dime to be effective. If you like it, you can always throw them a few bucks towards ""premium"" game time, which grants bigger rewards at the end of each battle, similar to how World of Tanks handles it. If you're a fan of BattleTech or have played any of the previous MechWarrior games, much of the gameplay will be familiar to you. You purchase BattleMechs ('Mechs for short), outfit them in the MechLab, and go to battle. You control the torso with the mouse, much like any shooter, but you control the legs independently from the torso with the keyboard (you can also use a joystick, gamepad, etc. for both). This allows you to shoot on the move, as well as dance around your target while continually pouring hellfire into them. If you've ever played World of Tanks, or used vehicles in Battlefield, you'll be familiar with the feel of this already. The developers have recently included a galaxy-spanning metagame, where the outcome of your battles have real consequences. Groups of players can fight for control of individual planets in the name of their faction (of which there are several to choose from), and the map is updated to reflect the ebb and flow of the battle lines as the campaign progresses. The closest existing example for this that comes to mind is WW2Online (Battleground Europe). Anyway, the game has a lot to offer and it gets my recommendation!			"

												Simply the best mech sim out there! There is nothing close to it. It captures all of the mechanics of the board game as well as all of it's predecessors since the first VGA came out in 1985. Mechwarrior is the cumilation of decades of perfection, like a samurai sword it has been folded hundreds of times, it is razor sharp and eternal, never rusting, never giving ground to noobs and neophytes. This game is amazing, easy to learn, difficult to master. Many people with low IQ will find this game frustrating since it requires intelligence as well as skill and tactical teamwork. If you are stupid, then stay away from this game because it is beyond your abilities. However, if you are intelligent, then welcome to the thinking man's shooter!			"

												Mechwarrior Online could have been better than this—and indeed it was for a brief period during the early beta some years ago. That golden age however was quickly put to an end by an aggressive monetization strategy.While some of the underlying design and technology behind MWO is fantastic—all is unfortunately squandered on a game that's shamelessly pay-to-win, selling its own soul for a quick buck, and betraying a rich lineage in the process.

												Comfort is a warm center torso Charlie Brown.Pros:-Looks pretty good for an mmo that's a couple years old.-Overall gameplay is fun and doesn't get boring.-Not pay to win. Mechs that can only be purchased for real cash like hero mechs are just unique variants, they don't provide an actual advantage (they do still provide a bonus in how much cash you earn). Similarily, champion mechs are just the most popular variant of a non hero mech with a better stock loadout and an xp bonus. There are plenty of trial mechs to use for free that are switched every once in a while, and you earn a very large casy bonus in your first 25 games. Grinding also doesn't get boring because, well, your job consists of blasting apart other mechs.-Though development was previously hellish (and there are many, many stories that attest to this), that is no longer the case. They have been doing a much better job since they split from the publisher.-You can customize mechs in many, many ways. You can add or remove armor, equipment and weapons of your choice. Inner sphere mechs can also swap engines, and clan mechs can swap arms and side torsos.Cons:-Gameplay can sometimes be rough. The learning curve is a big one here, and even though I previously played mechwarrior 3 quite a bit I still mostly suck :). Mechs are piloted like walking tanks in mechwarrior (seperately moving arms, torsos and legs), so if you played WOT you may have an advantage.-Some balance issues, especially between clan and inner sphere mechs, but the devs are always working to improve on this.Though this game isn't perfect, it is still very fun overall. As a previous player of Mechwarrior 3, I was inially somewhat skeptical about how fun mechwarrior could be without a campaign, but I think it's pretty fine as it is.See you on the battlefield!			"

												I have been playing it for many years and it is a very conpetetive game with a very steep learning curve. If you make a small mistake in this game it will get you killed, Team work is key if your team do not work with each other then you will more than likely be looking at a loss. This is a true game of skill, postioning, accuracy and over all Team work. Takes a long time to learn the in's and out's. That all said, im still playing it because of all that. Any one can free fall 360 NoScope in most other games but not this one, this game widdles out those type of cheap shot players and finds players with real skills, players who know when to shild and when to shoot, when to take cover and when to trade, when to defend and when to push, players that use infomation to their advantage, to weaken their opponent. No game here this is a Battletech sim and its a WAR!!			"

												I can't stop  playing this game. If all you're looking for is Armored Core-levels of mech customization and stomping around in a legit mech-simulator, THIS IS FOR YOU. Don't think of it as anything else other than what it is...a slow, strategic team-based FPS.F2P turns off most people, but I played for nearly three years (pre-Steam, obv) without spending a cent. Your first 25 matches net you a TON of in-game credits and you have lots of trial mechs of all different types to get a feel of what you want before you spend your credits for it.There's an amazing community at www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG, or /r/OutreachHPG in case my URL gets deleted. Ask your questions, but realize this game punishes newbies and the learning curve is great. BUT, it's SO worth it! Don't jump into a new game expecting to know how to play it and to be an expert, put yourself out of your comfort zone and HELP BRING BACK THE MECHWARRIOR/BATTLEMECH FRANCHISE!			"

No single player campaign, only battle maps.

												If you've played and enjoyed Mechwarrior titles in the past, definitely try this out. Don't let the negative reviews out there stop you. There are a lot of them out there, but if you look closely you'll find many were written a few years ago (when the concerns, now fixed, may have actually been valid) or are written by those obviously so attached to the idea of what the game ""could be"" if it were designed by themselves. Think of them like the crazy neighbours crying about government conspiracy because the garbage pickup wasn't on time, and ""something should be done because by God, I've lived on this block for 20 years!""I'm writing this a few weeks after picking up the game and can say PGI has done a great job. The devs have captured the original feeling of Mechwarrior that made me fall in love with the series decades ago. PGI has also been unfairly accused of being greedy. But remember, this is a free game. Any money you choose to spend on this game is a choice. And having played against some wallet warriors, I can say the mechs/upgrades that can be bought with cash do not generally provide players with an unfair advantage.They generally only speed things up, marginally. And really, please don't shame private companies for trying to make a buck, especially when you don't have to pay anything at all -- these guys gotta eat!Please be ready for a complex game: this ain't no Call of Duty. Mechs are slow, they're big targets, have long cool downs between shots (for some weapons), and generally depend on having support mechs around to survive. You'll have to do things like watch out for overheating, tagging targets for team mates, taking cover from sniper fire, turning your mech so damage is evenly distributed around your armour, etc, etc. For me, the complexity is what makes the game exciting -- things such as the dread of having my mech shut down in a fight because I forgot to override the engine overheat safety shut off (yes, you can do that), or remembering to turn on infrared vision in a foggy map to see the heat signatures of enemy mechs through the mist.Because of the complexity, skill at playing this game will come more with time rather than with reflex. You will rightfully feel like other players are better at first, simply because they've learned to use the control buttons not taught in the tutorial. Press F1 for the button layout. Other than that, enjoy and hopefully I'll see you in game!			"

												I must say I have been obsessed with this game for almost 3 years now. It is not your typical FPS. It is a game that requires intense situational awareness and is also very unforgiving. This is a 'Mech Simulator' and is known to stick to the Tabletop gameplay as much as possible while being a thrilling FPS all at the same time. I have been a fan of Mechwarrior/Battletech since Mechwarrior 2 and Battletech (sega genesis) so that might have a lot to do with my infatuation with this game. No it is not perfect, far from it. But having some good teamwork and patience makes this game incredibely rewarding!Highly Recomend to anyone.If youre looking for something a little more faster pace and nearly equal amount of customization, try Hawken.

												I have been playing this game for the last couple of years. I have spent a lot of money on it. I continue to play, and have pre-purchased a number of things yet to come out.I do recommend this game, but not for many people.Since going on Steam, I have noticed a definet lowering of skill in the player base. Namely in the Community Warfare games. I have witnessed many people shooting the gates themselves, rather than the power generator. I have seen them run off to do their own thing and get killed for it. The old problem of being shot in the back by teammates at the start of a match is back because people want to test fire.If you want to play this game then I suggest you read the forums first. There is a wonderful section for new players. If you cannot be arsed to do that much, there is an in game tutorial about handling your mech, firing weapons and generally how to not get popped shortly after your mech is dropped on the planet. It rewards you with in game currency for doing the tutorial. Sadly, there is no tutorial covering Community Warfare, but is it really so difficult to watch what all of the other pilots are doing before rushing off to do your own thing? More importantly, is it really so important that you ignore what other pilots are telling you? Many times I have attempted to direct my team, or even just make a suggestion like ""stick together, fire on the same target."" I get it, I am a veteran and therefore exude some kind of aura that says ""do the opposite, ignore them, blame them if it goes wrong and argue with them about their expeirence."" I would think that it would not be so hard to fight against that aura, but recent evidence is proving me wrong.Are there problems with this game? Sure, it has glitches. Namely, I find that I crash when I play it through Steam. Sometimes there are problems with the maps and I get stuck with certain chassis in particular spots, or I get stuck rubber banding. These things happen. But worse than any glitches, is the new player base. Learn to pilot your multi-ton death machine to the benefit of your team, or take off the neuro-helm and find something else.			"

												I have been playing this game a long, long time. I've put quite a bit of money into it as well. Would I say it's worth it? Yes. Would I say this game is worth picking up? Yes. Click that download button and join the war this game offers because no other FPS out there makes you consider your every action.			"

												Been playing this game for three years (started in closed beta). If you give it enough time to get over the learning curve it will be one of the most fun and playstyle-diverse games you'll ever play. Its the best mech sim game right now, and honestly the only one that feels like you're piloting a mech instead of an unreal-tournament dude in a mech skin. Gameplay pace is a slow as you want it. Play an assault if you want slower, more deliberate action, and a light if you want faster-twich play.			"

												Fun stompy robot game! Is it perfect..no. Has development been smooth and timely..no (though it has been better over the past year). But customizing a mech to meet your play stile then dropping onto the battlefield to do  battle with your fellow MechWarriors Is a lot of fun!			"

												I've been a fan of MechWarrior since I was a kid. This game seriously delivers and feels like a true expansion on the universe. Although I recommend the game, I would like to point out some weakpoints.1. The tutorial falls short. It takes you through the basics but the customization in MechWarrior Online is immense and the sheer number of buttons that work in game is on par with a good flight simulator. There is a learning curve and you will have to figure out the intricacies yourself.2. The in-game currency is earned slowly and the purchased currency is expensive. This is the case with most free to play games, but MechWarrior Online is a little steep even by these standards. A single assault mech can cost upwards of $30. You'll need to earn experience on 3 variants of the same mech to maximize your perks, do the math.3. Waiting. You only get one life in a normal game and four lives in a Faction based game. After your lives are expended, you have to wait for the match to expire before you can begin again. I normally enjoy this style of play but I have found myself in a match with an AFK player that forces everyone to wait for the 15 minuite match timer to expire before play can begin again (the maps can get pretty big, and AFK/disconnected players are not always found).

												I've been playing for three years now, and it's held my attention better than most.  It's not perfect, but it's got depth and the mech customization means you really see a lot of variety, and all playstyles are catered to.  It does take some parctice, so be patient with yourself. "

												As a long time veteran player, fan of the mechwarrior series and a general lover of big stompy robots. I would seriously recommend giving the game a try.Unlike most shooters a mech has legs and a torso that you have to control seperately.  A mech plays like a giant walking tank. However unlike a tank the mech consists of independent body parts. You can lose arms, a leg or shoulders and still keep on going. When you lose a body part, you also lose the weapons in that body part. This adds an extra layer of tactics on top of normal shooter gameplay. By twisting away you can choose which body part will take the damage. Also unlike most shooters a mech also has two cross-hairs, one for the weapons in the torso and one for the weapons in the arms (you do need to turn arm lock off). You control both with the mouse at the same time, one just moves a bit slower then the other. The weapons located in the arms can aim much higher and lower and move faster. They are however less protected then the weapons in the torso. This means that you have to think about your position on the battlefield. You want to move so all your weapons can shoot while your opponent won't be able to shoot back at all or atleast with all his weapons.You are also able to customize your mech. Change the weapons, the speed at which the mech moves and a few other things. Because you're able to control which body part will take most of the damage and because the location of the weapons in the body matters this allows for allot of interesting choices and gameplay.That said. Buying mechs and upgrading mechs is expensive. As new player you won't notice right away. Completing the tutorial, mechwarrior academy and the first two dozen of games will shower you with C-Bills. After that it takes some serious grinding. Pick your first purcachse wisely.The gameplay is still that of an Arena shooter, two teams of 12 players face off one of 13 maps. In quick play there is no respawn and fight last usually about 7-8 minutes. After that it is mopping up for the victor. In quickplay there are three game modes. Though on most maps the winner is usually decided by which side wins the big fight in the middle. The objectives don't matter much here. There are other strategies but those require a coordinated team which you won't find in quick play.For coordinated teams there is faction warefare. Two teams of 12 players either try to asault or defend a base. Each team has 4 respawns. A good game usually last between 30 and 45 minutes. This game mode can be allot of fun but I would not recomment this to new players or people looking to shoot stuff. The veteran players are extremly well coordinated and highly skilled. If you don't know what you're doing, you will lose horribly and generally not enjoy it.The game is free to play and you won't be locked out of anything essential. However if you want to have more then 4 mechs (and you will!) you will need to buy mechbays. These are cheap, about 2$ each and often given away for free during an event. There are also some upgrades that are extremly expensive and cost more then a mech. As a new player you can ignore these quite easilly though they do become important later on. At that point you'll have to either decide to grind it all out or use one of the premium options to speed it all up.			"

(this paragraph is null and void as literally right after i wrote this, i found you can earn mechbays through faction warfare)all in all, an amazing game that i'd happily spend 10 dollars on for the time ive put into this game. (i played before it was on steam)  i would recommend this to any giant robot fans, fans of the series, or people who enjoy driving tanks (as the controlls closely resemble tank controls from other games).

												3 out of 5 stars A satisfying MechWarrior experience that takes as much teamwork and discipline as it does skill to best your opponent. This is a chess like tactical shooter that requires you to purchase and setup a mech to fit your play style, and then challenges you to master that play style. Mics are required as much as a mouse is, and you aren't going to get very far without one.If you are looking for a game to get your MechWarrior fix in with then this will do the trick. This game has enough stragety and skill based elements in it to balance out the ""pay to win"" aspects of an ""online version"" of a game. That being said, this game could be light years better if it weren't for the pay to win mechanic that does exist. If you take this game seriously in any way you are going to want to purchase a few mechs which will end up costing you about the same price that they could charge if they made you pay to play the game in the first place. It only feels like a pay to win game in the mech lab mode, as there aren't alot of over powered things that you can add to your setup, as long as your team plays with good fundamentals.Each match, outside of faction play, consists of a 12 versus 12 setup with a max time format, having a kill limit or score limit end the game early. You get 1 life and no health regeneration. There are 4 game modes consisting of Skirmish, Domination, Assualt, and Conquest. Assault being a VIP escort mode, Domination is king of the hill, and Conquest is like territories from halo 2. And yes If you own at territories you are still a noob.There is a leveling system in this game and I will explain it the best I can in a flow chart style, with a little humor.-play pick up games with trial mechs.-grind for money to buy a mech that you might like-realize that you hate the mech you bought and scrap it for a different one-grind-in the meantime, learn how weapon systems work and how different builds have different roles on the field-realize its going to take months to grind to have the mechs that you want-pay money for the mechs so you dont waste your time-realize that you didn't understand the mechanics and re-buy the mech that you scrapped earlier-level up a few different mechs to mastery efficiency via grinding in pugs-grind to load said mechs with mods-build a drop deck for faction play-group up and que with other players that you like playing with-play faction mode, shoot face, reck the enemy, and conquer planets.If I won the lottery there would be a much better MechWarrior game and possibly a movie in production, but for now, as Mechwarrior fans, are just going to have to settle for this.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.			"

												MWO is one of the few really good and very fair F2P games, it's a really fun mech combat game proto-simulator with excellent meaningful complexity for an FPS in terms of customisation and personal preference.This game is definitely a keeper for anyone who likes giant stompy robots, and if you don't like giant stompy robots then you should try it and you'll end up liking giant stompy robots, there is no need to be a MechWarrior franchise or lore fan to like it, also it's very casual friendly if you stick to the normal queue.Is it perfect? No, it has some weapon balance concerns, suffers from a noticeably low time to kill(TTK) and a problematic Community Warfare model are some annoyances, but they keep developing it and it gets better so eventually those things will get ironed out hopefully as well.Do note however, while it's casual friendly, it has a much higher learning curve much due to the customisation options and various weapons and utility options available, so don't be afraid to ask for advice here or on the forums on www.mwomercs.com and www.reddit.com/r/outreachhpg/ or /mwoHappy stomping, and may your armour stay intact and your guns remain cool o7			"

Don't think of it as anything else other than what it is...a slow, strategic team-based FPS.F2P turns off most people, but I played for nearly three years (pre-Steam, obv) without spending a cent. Your first 25 matches net you a TON of in-game credits and you have lots of trial mechs of all different types to get a feel of what you want before you spend your credits for it.There's an amazing community at www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG, or /r/OutreachHPG in case my URL gets deleted. Ask your questions, but realize this game punishes newbies and the learning curve is great. BUT, it's SO worth it!

												This game is a one of a kind and it's amazing. Don't let other people tell you otherwise. While it has its flaws, it's an absolute marvel to play when you are in the upper tiers where people aren't noobs.As a tier 1 player with well over 700 hours (I played a lot when it wasn't on Steam), I can give you new players tips.For starters, this game is not your run of the mill CoD clone ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, nor is it like Battlefield. This is a vehicular mech fighting game, and not the gundam type where everything can dash and sidestep willynilly.Rather, you control like a tank, as in your torso and legs are seperate. You ""Strafe"" by lining your torso to the side of your legs. I would recommend getting used to playing with your arms unlocked at all times, it makes no sense to use a slower aim point that is locked arms, there is no benefit to it.By keeping your arms unlocked, you can be sure that your arm mounted weapons can travel faster/further up and down as well as left and right. Keep in mind some mechs do not have arms, only shoulders which can only go up and down.In terms of mechanics, this game feels great to be good at. Make sure to look up guides on torso twisting, mech parts tagetting and which weapon dooes what.Also make sure to look up guides on buying your first mech because you will not always be given cbills for free, your first purchase matter in how you will enjoy the game. Make sure you buy what fits you.I have not felt any game quite like MWO that drives my enjoyment of working as a team. Play with a friend, it's worth it.If you ever see anyone say ""This game is broken with pay to win♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; you can instantly know they are talking♥♥♥♥♥♥ you cannot buy power in any way whatsoever. You can only be good at the game, that's it.If you need help with the game, feel free to visit MWO's forums, people will gladly answer your questions.Have fun and good luck, pilots.			"

												MWO is one of the few really good and very fair F2P games, it's a really fun mech combat game proto-simulator with excellent meaningful complexity for an FPS in terms of customisation and personal preference.This game is definitely a keeper for anyone who likes giant stompy robots, and if you don't like giant stompy robots then you should try it and you'll end up liking giant stompy robots, there is no need to be a MechWarrior franchise or lore fan to like it, also it's very casual friendly if you stick to the normal queue.Is it perfect? No, it has some weapon balance concerns, suffers from a noticeably low time to kill(TTK) and a problematic Community Warfare model are some annoyances, but they keep developing it and it gets better so eventually those things will get ironed out hopefully as well.Do note however, while it's casual friendly, it has a much higher learning curve much due to the customisation options and various weapons and utility options available, so don't be afraid to ask for advice here or on the forums on www.mwomercs.com and www.reddit.com/r/outreachhpg/ or /mwoHappy stomping, and may your armour stay intact and your guns remain cool o7			"

This game is fun and frustrating at the same time. Not for former COD or WOW players. The learning curve is steep but rewarding. I will give PGI credit by walking a very thin line between PTW and keeping the game truely FTP. I do complain about the game but I also willing give the cannucks money for 'mechs.

Product received for free
												Fun game that is essentially a tank arena game.  I wish there was a co-op mission option for fans of the old-school Mechwarrior games, but I won't knock it for being something it's not.  I'm generally not crazy about F2P games, becuase they are generally really grindy like MMOs, and this one is too to an extent, but it's well-balanced.  After playing for a day I had enough credits to afford a servicable mech with a customized loadout.  Paying real world money gets you the ability to have more than one personal mech at a time, 'premium time' where you get exp and such faster, visual florishes and mechs without the grind.  Generally these things are just a couple of bucks but some of the high-end mechs can go for as much as 20 bucks.'Twenty bucks for an in-game mech?' you ask.  Well, yeah, such things are available for the turbo-nutters who want them.  But for the most part they just grant a permenent exp increase; they have some other perks too but the game is so team-centric that it doesn't seem very unbalancing.  Two mechs working together will still beat one on it's own, platinum-plated or not.  So, good game.  Definitely worth a download to try it out.			"

												I was going to rant about this game for a few reasons:-Poorly optimized to the Cry Engine(still is),-Slow progress from devs when it comes to well-needed patches(they are a very small company),-Stuff is BADLY needed in the gameI'm a 3-year vet of MWO; been playing as ""Zephonarch II"" since early Beta, I've seen the transitions from LRMMania, GaussMania, MetaLaserMania, The Clan Mech-introduction, The InnerSphere Mech Quirk introduction, and now the removal of Quirks as PGI has seen it as a dumb idiotic directionless mistake. It was a band-aid plan to patch terrible balancing from the beginning. That's right. This game has a history of annoying nerfs and OP-boosts.It used to be manageable when it was just coming onto the market; it was simpler. AC2Os were frightening up close. Still are, but people complained then. Then the Clans came which BY LORE they're supposed to be OP opposed to IS(Inner Sphere) mechs. Quirks were awful. These new boosts and hybrid-mechs were the reason why maps had to be made larger(The mechs were too fast!)(TOO FAST). PGI's been ""fixing"" their mistakes for the whole time I've known of them. And I uninstalled due to overloading stress building over the years just around March or April.I had no hope going into reinstalling the game simply cause my gaming laptop suddenly couldn't handle the new larger, refined old maps. It ticked me off so badly, I resorted to zombie builds only. I barely moved, but I still could deal good amounts of damage at 8 FPS. ...And then I checked it out once the download finished. It's fine. I don't know what PGI did, but I suddenly can play this again. ... I get so irritated by PGI though, they never advertise Optimization improvements they make. I wouldv'e came back a while ago if they had included it in the emails! The game USED to perform practically at 20 FPS(At it's old best). Now I get 40-50 FPS. WHAT DID YOU DO PGI? HUH? YOU'RE NOT GOING TO AT LEAST BOAST THAT THE GAME'S BETTER FOR MID-SPEC RANGE PCS NOW??? I'M HAPPY AGAIN. I CAN PLAY. I GOT A KILL FOR 5 MATCHES STRAIGHT SINCE I STARTED PLAYING + I HELPED MY TEAM. NO DE-SYNCS. NO RANDOM LAG SPIKES FROM 3 RANDOM LRM-BOATS OR HUGE CQC-FIGHTS. JUST GOOD FIGHTS. THANK YOU PGI.MechWarrior:Online is worth it. Just plan for the right mechs for yourself, and you'll start planning tactics like a pro in no time. Just mind the bump that is PGI. The game may fall apart again with its history. It's sad but hey if you can handle a long grind with a good mech with good builds,... hey MechWarrior is great then.			"

 -- A bit lacking in gameplay options. No matter what the mode, it plays out like a skirmish. - Pricing seems off. Not very tempted to spend money as the packs are unnappealing and the stuff you can buy is  expensive. The F2P grind isnt so bad for the very patient. You get decent money at start, If you spend it wisely you will have a competitive mech in about 25 matches. +++ lots of Mechs. lots of variety. classics are there locust, jenner, battlemaster, marauder and company. + The Mechlab is well done. Customizing yours is easy and the options are vast.++ Mech combat is fun. Mech handling and operation is pretty much like it was in the old games. - The maps, though nice, are stale and lack any sort of life. The scale of some of the set pieces seems off but whatever.. Destructable set props like buildings and such wouldve been very nice.If your a fan of the mechwarrior series, go for it.If you want to customize a Big battle mech and fight in the arena 12 vs 12, go for it.

												Please understand this is a first impression review. Now what should we start with first? The Pros of the Cons, eh? Don’t worry I will flip a coin. Tails! Cons it is.1: The Academy aka the tutorialAt first it looks like your really going to be educated on what it takes to be a MechWarrior but in reality you are given the bare bone necessities even some of their more advanced education can barely cover what you will encounter in live combat. BattleMechs do not stand still. In live combat if you are standing still you may as well paint a giant bullseye on you. In short the tutorial does not prepare you for the riggers of war in a Mech.2: Mech BuildsWithin my limited knowledge never have I seen in Battletech, MechWarrior and MechCommander has anyone ever decided for you how you will build or set up your Mech. Before M.W.O. your only limitations were Tonnage, Heat, Defense, Offense and Utilitarian. Now with M.W.O. you have to deal with what you are allowed to put where on YOUR MECH!!!3: Pay wallsWhere as I follow the philosophy that nothing is truly free and few people can truly be trusted MechWarrior Online is the absolute epitome of pay to play. You can’t get a mech that does what you want it to, you can’t open a cache, you cant have items in your cockpit, you can not change the color or pattern on your Mech, you can not run a Unit successfully without cold hard cash and for some of us that is just not a possibility.4: Be it BattleTech, MechWarrior or MechCommander there has always been a story to tell. In MechWarrior Online there is no story to tell and that bothers me. Pros1: FunOMG this game will leave you panting and wanting more. It will run you ragged and wanting more. This game will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off and make you want it even more.2: CommunityMWO has an amazing community that will help you every step of the way. Litteraly people from every walk of life that will advise you as you need it. Listen carefully and learn when to ask for help.Yeah thats it for now more to come as I learn more about the game.			"

												It's free. Play it if you liked the old Mechwarriors/Mechassault games - you'll get a few hours of fun out of it. Piloting mechs from the first person angle is pretty immersive, and killing mechs is incredibly rewarding.At some point the shady business practices of the developer and the overly grindy nature of C-Bills will get to you. Again, it's free, so you can just leave. Play it, but don't pay into it.			"

												The grind at the beggining is real. You have to pick a good first Mech; good as in one that is fun for you to play, as it will be a while before you can afford another one (cadet bonus + academy rewards only last for so long). Fortunately, if you made a mistake in your purchase you can simply start a new account :)Once you get yourself few Mechs, and found your favourite playstyle - this is where the game shines. Unfortunately, if you don't want to spend any money, in order to get more Mechs you will need to rely on Faction Play and events to rack up some Mech bays.Still, would recommend for any Mechwarrior fans out there. Beware though, it's not your typical MW game...			"

												I've got about 22 hours in, and so far it's been a lot of fun, for the most part. The aspects of the BattleTech universe have been rather well-balanced with the necessities of good gameplay. Graphics are good (to me at least, lol) and it runs well on my PC. Controls take some getting used to, but with practice and tinkering of the key list, it works. A player dedicated to mastering the concepts and tactics of the game can contribute regardless of 'Mech, and while it takes time to build up one's inventory, it can be done without throwing much if any money at the product (so far I haven't spent a dime).That said the price points for some of the pay-content seem rather high to me. There's no real option to purchase gear, etc. in any amount *without* basically 'subscribing' for a month of premium. This agitates me because I'd like to pitch some money at the game, but for now the cost for such limited return is rather high for a casual gamer like myself.That's a rather minor criticism from me though, as most other points of the game are solid. Very happy with my play time so far, and find myself constantly coming back for more. As close to a 'Mech 'simulation' that's still enjoyable that I've played in quite some time.Last piece of advice: as a new player, play through the tutorial, and finish all the 'cadet' achievements for a hefty number of free C-Bills. Take your time thinking before you spend it, do some reading, then spend and modify cautiously.			"

												This is easily one of the best f2p games out there at the moment. I see a lot of negative reviews focused on micro transitions. But the only microtransitions are for vanity objects. Any ACTUAL weapon or mech or anything like that can be bought with money gained through combat. The playerbase is VERY friendly, I've played around 30 hours and have not had one bad player experience. Everybody is helpful and welcoming of new people. It's a really great game. Just be aware the learning curve can be a little tough at the start so don't let that discourage you, everybody starts somewhere.			"

												Good game!  Fun, teamwork oriented, lots of grinding mechs...but it's still fun!  I wasn't a fan of the Battletec universe before now, but this game turned me on to it...I'm loving it!  The game itself can be a little slow sometimes, but the matches are a blast to play.  The level of customization is crazy too...even though it leans into pay to play there heavily.  You can grind out most anything you want here though for free.  Overall a fun game!

												Mechwarrior... most oldies like me probably playing this game due to nostalgia above anything else. The games previously released by Activision are more interesting, although dated graphics. Before Mechwarrior Online was released, Mechwarrior: Living Legends (MWLL), also an online version of Mechwarrior, was exciting and interesting with good graphics as Activision's Mechwarrior series. But alas MWLL had been taken down.This Mechwarrior Online (MWO) is by PGI, doesn’t have anything more than two teams going at each other (friendy fire is on), but as long as fanboys are pouring money in for new MWO mechs, it probably won't have anything more.  MWO is only recommended for people who can continually play games like Counterstrike, without getting bored; just with Robots.			"

												A great F2P game that isn't pay to win.   Griant robots in 12v12 combat that never gets old.  4 weight classes and multiple play styles so there is someting for everyone.   If you ever played Battletech or Mechwarrior in either the table top or video game forms you have to try this.  If not you need to discover this universe.  I have played this since closed beta and 4 years later, i'm still playing with over 600hours of game time.  Tryit, play it for a few weeks, but be sure and do the tutoials, the rewards are WELL worthi t and you will have a much better idea of how to play.  Sniping, scouting, brawling, indirect fire, this game has it all and it just doesn't get old.  There is always a new mech coming out and while they cost $ at first after a few months they go for ingame currency  They even do monthly rewards/contest that let you get free paid currency or items that can only be purchased with the paid currency.   After you get used to the game, fnd a group to play with and it only gets better.  Has PGI messed up over the years, oh yeah, big time, but the game is still great and a lot of the old issues are fixed.  Don't get me wrong, there is still a lot of improvements/expansion that could be made, but i still play this at least a few times a week if not daily.  IT's just that good.  did I mention it's FREE, download it and take a shot			"

												I've been playing since the last days of open Beta, and the game is in the best state it's ever been.That said, there's still a LOT of room for improvement. The Good: With a coordinated team that knows what they're doing, the game is fun as hell. The mech models look pretty great. For a few brief, shining moments the game can occasionally be the ""mech simulator/Thinking Man's Shooter"" that its hyped up to be, but those moments are few and far between.The Bad: The meta is heavily skewed towards massive burst damage that turns the ""thinking man's shooter"" into ""is that an enem- where'd all my armor and components go?"". The gamemodes available are Team Deathmatch, Team Deathmach with lights running around to capture zones, Team Deathmatch that sometimes ends in before anyone gets any kills because lights with capture modules ran to the otherside of the map, and Queue Warrior Online, also called ""How I learned to hate the Clans and get stomped by 12-mans"". The weapon balance is constantly in flux, but rarely in ways that make sense. Rather than simply tweaking values, the devs prefer to add in ""ghost"" features that are never adequately explained and usually just make the balance issues worse. The Worse: Know this before you start investing time and money: The developers have a long history of being out of touch with the reality of the game. They've blatantly lied to players more times than I can count and see the player base as little more than wallets to be sucked dry. The game's pricing system may well go down in history as the worst ever. All that said, the game is currently the best Mechwarrior game in the market (because development on the Living Legends mod for Crysis ""conveniently"" stopped around the time this game started up)			"

The game is ugly for Cryengine. Direct X9.0 is the only way the game can be played with Direct X11 being tack on buy not really working.  The Grind is awful. Mechs are content. If you don’t like collecting robots I doubt this game will appeal to you. I doubt this game will appeal to most people.			"

												Pros: Free Big Stompy RobotsCons: Everything Else1/10 Would not trust shills again.>>>>>>**CAUTIONARY WARNING** <<<<<<This is a casual Team Death Match game VERY LOOSELY based on the Battletech Universe, and that's in the Mech Models only. If all you want is to kill some time and blow stuff up, its not bad. If you enjoy Battletech LORE, the Table Top game(s) then understand it does NOT exist here.Mechwarrior: Online is a Swiss Army Knife... it tries to please everyone and pull in as big of a crowd as it can, promising the world, but never really delivers or does anything well... just ""good enough"" and the main focus of development is primarily centered around pushing out new Mech models.The game as a casual “just stomp around and blow stuff up” is fun, but that’s the thin candy-coated shell that covers the bland, uninspiring empty center of the game. And this is the major reason why there are so many mixed reviews… there are many people who enjoy the casual lack of depth this game has, but there are just as many people who really wanted the depth that was promised and believed that depth to be delivered in a TIMELY fashion instead of accepting years of “Glacial Progression” about everything (such as MW:O finally got working monitors JUST in time for steam launch after years of staring at multiple “AUTO DETECT: NO” screens)Also, it helps to understand how the upper management developers of this game work before new players consider investing into the game. Here are some examples I’d suggest reading or looking up the following issues and coming to your own conclusions:- PGI and Transverse game- First Developer blog and intentions of addressing issues yet still exist 4 years later:   •	Urban Combat to address circle strafing and long range sniping.   •	Dynamic Battlefield further expanded on the concepts of Urban Combat and mechs having roles.   •	Dynamic pacing, introduced an early version of one of the final pillars, Information Warfare.(ref:  http://mwomercs.com/news/2011/10/2-dev-blog-0  )-Most recent admission of balance issues by a lead developer, suggestion of change and implementation of another system, termed “Infotech”:(ref: http://mwomercs.com/forums/topic/208441-mech-rebalance-and-pts/ )Russ Bullock’s reaction on Twitter to the player base regarding people heavily commenting on and rejecting the proposed “Infotech” issue, telling people “it’s turfed already, so you can all sleep again.”( ref: https://twitter.com/russ_bullock/status/662804251668692992 )As of this writing, the new “IIC” clan battlemechs have been introduced. New players will obviously be able to follow how the community and PGI reacts to these new mechs but will be a great indicator of how things eventually work out in MW:O and what to expect from there on… so read the forums and both reddits to see and understand the kind of community you’re getting involved with.I’m not saying you should or shouldn’t play this game or put money into it, you should be old enough to make up your own mind about playing a game and what you consider “worth it.” Just don’t expect a lot of depth beyond what you get your first few games, and as far as PGI fixing things, if you stick around, get used to the word ""Soon.""

Intro/Cons:I know it says i only have about 68 hrs on record at the time of writing this review but i have been playing since closed beta and trust me this game has come a long way since then. One of the main issues however still persists and that is the outdated engine the game runs on. The cryengine is a very pretty engine however PGI don't quite know how to use it well. Don't let that stop you from picking up the game even if you have never heard of Battletech or Mechwarrior before you could still have some fun. The learning curve is a very steep one although not as steep as it was in the past, early on there was no tutorial to teach new players the basics.Pros:On to some of the good things about the game, the first being the incredibly generous F2P model this game has. You can play every single mech in the game for completely free kind of. The game operates under a ""Chassis"" system where every chassis is available for free, there are some exceptions such as newly released mechs those will be released for free shortly after however. There are special versions that offer C-Bill bonuses (the free currency, MC being the premium currency) as well as bonus to xp, those being Hero and Champion mechs. I won't get into too much detail because i am sure someone has explained it. Another great thing about this game is the fact that it get's updated every month at the very least as that is when they release new mech chassis into the game. This year they are also releasing a bunch of new weapons so this year is probably the best time to get into the game as everyone will be learning the new weapons and the meta will get shaken up quite a bit.All in all I would say pick it up try it out and if you don't like it feel free to right a negative review because even the community knows this game isn't perfect. However it's all we have right now until the next mechwarrior game comes out later this year in the form of Battletech.			"

												Great game, similar to the Mechwarrior series from decade(s) ago. It does take awhile to adapt to the mouse sensitivity, but, after 482 matches and lots of teamwork, it's very fun. The use of a mic facilitates teamwork. Lots of people playing, men-women-kids, at any given time meaning quickplay matches are always ongoing. I am probably addicted to this game-it IS that good.

												Been playing MWO since February 2013 so I've logged more hours into this game than anything else I've ever played. Despite what you might hear, the game has a come a long way and nails the feel of piloting giant walking tanks from the Battletech universe. Gameplay is both varied due to the different mech classes but can get repetitive because of the limited gamemodes. At times balance between items/mechs can be very frustrating but it is generally better than it has been in the past and it seems like they are making progress (despite it being slow). Evidently, despite my criticism and my hope for more content/features I enjoy the experience. My advice, find a unit, make some ingame friends and have some fun. The game really does come together when you start seeing teams working together.			"

												It might have flaws here and there but I love it nonetheless.It has a very steep learning curve (might call it a learning cliff!) but it is definitely worth it to pull through.The community is still great and very willing to help, just ask and your questions will be answered, lots of good threads and guides here on Steam;you might come across some toxic player every once in a while but that really is the exception.It is free to play, do not spend money before you have taken your time to learn the ropes. Give it at least two weeks, better two months until you finally judge for yourself.			"

												I have an Inner shere account, and a clan account, been playing 3 years spent 130 bucks, in an always online server side game.. Not bad ehh...Giant robots with tons of customization are the big plus in this game. When it comes to the Mech warrior games, as far as the pvp goes, this one has the best balance between the weight classes. Any class can take out any other which is a nice change from previous titles. The Balance between mechs though is a bit off, at least at this time so some mechs are just stronger than others. But the flip side of that with balance changes from time to time, the best mechs can and will change. The game like all PvP games has a pretty steep learning curve, but the people on the Offical MWO new player forums are very helpful so it is a good idea to ask questions, even if it's to say hi before ya even start.  The game like all online games, especially those that have not been around long. (to me 3 years is just a baby) It needs time to grow. I do find the game lots of fun, but will admit it does get repetitive due to limited game modes. But take a break for a week or month, and it feels fresh again for me.At this point in time there is  no single player which is unfortunate, but that is coming in the future, or so they say. We can only hope.It's free, nothing wrong with trying and seeing for yourself if it is for you.  One last thing, while the game does have micro transactions that seam pretty high, you can easily get by with spending 7-15 and buying mech bays, annd you can play a wide varriety at that point with just time played, and earning things in game. You can also earn tons of stuff durring events, and sales happen about twice a month on the weekends.  I spent about 100 bucks over the last 3 years and put a ton of time into it. Not a bad deal for an online game.			"

												So, Mechwarrior Online... is it great ? Is it Fun ?I have played all mechwarrior games released for PC (Mechwarrior series, MechCommander Series) and I must say, YES, it is FUN and YES it is great to play it, but I do recognize that it is not a game for everyone. Since it is a mix of first person shooter and a kind of simulation game, the leaning curve is quite high. It takes a while to ge use to it.Controls in MWO are, in my opinion, better than in the previous games. Much more fast and smooth to play. If you don´t know what Battletech is and never played anything from Mechwarrior, I still believe you should give it a try. You might like it. Do not enter this game expecting to have an opinion in a couple of hours. You got to play it for a while to really undesrtand if MWO is a game for you. Also, the matches have a flow, starts slow, get real frenzy by the midle and may stay like it till the end or slow down again. That is the game experience. One of the MWO videos says: a thinker man shooter. I do agree with that very much. It is not the king of game you run towards your enemy shooting. You got to understand  who is your enemy, whats his position and direction, how his mech is damaged, what weapons he got. All this makes a difference. You have to analise, think, than shoot. Also, team work is essential in this game. Play alone, die alone. A side note, when your mech gets destroyed in a match, you are down. No respawns. If you like huge mechs shooting each other, destructable parts (you can loose your arms, a leg and still be in the battle - how cool is that ?), have a more tactical experience, really... give it a try.There are two game modes (the second one called Faction play is best played when you join a UNIT).Also, the community is great, truly great.The only thing that is missing is a single player mode. Maybe in the future... "

												I've never really followed Mechwarrior so I don't have an initial opinion on the series, but I am greatly enjoying this game. It's pretty easy to get the hang of with the great tutorial. You start with some free mechs that are really good. As you win matches you earn cash to purchase mechs that you can customize with different weapons depending on your playstyle. Buying a mech with real money is a shortcut, but doesn't provide any REAL benefits - just different mechs with different configurations (more lasers and less armor, jump jets vs rockets, etc). It's really fun, give it a try.			"

												Great game. A massive improvement over what it was like when it first came out. A lot of the old maps have had overhauls and are much more interesting to fight on. One piece of advice for new players get yourself into a unit (Its what this game calls a gaming clan) as soon as possible it massively reduces the grind and you will have way more fun to boot with a coordinated team.

												This is by far, the best mech game in the MW series/BT Universe.  And aside from that, who doesn't like amazing graphics with even better gameplay?  For new players, it's definitely not a Pay-to-Win Game. (Never spent a dime on it)  It's easy to adapt to everything, because you customize virtually anything that you want.  This game has a great community and easy-to-learn controls, and the guides are there for you if you're a new player seeking for help.  Overall, this is a great game, and I recommend it to all of those people out there who like complete control over what they want to use (with weapons, mechs, extra modules, and etc.) and people who just enjoy hardcore realistic simulators or even FPS players.  It's quite challenging to get tired of a game that includes endless combinations for skins, weapons, and mechs.  I can guarantee you that you'll love it as much as I did the moment you've completed the tutorial and when you finish your first match.  (By the way, I also recommend to spend money on the game after you're used to the system and have a basic understanding of the game)			"

												Mechwarrior Online should bring some really great feelings to those of you who grew up with the previous iterations or have a love for the Battletech universe. I believe that if you were looking for a giant robot simulator with competitive gameplay, this would be one that most closely feels like you are piloting a mech. There are some other games out there in this genre but they each bring something different to the table. I will really only talk about this one and I'll try keep it concise as possible. PROGRESSION: Mechwarrior Online provides you an entry into battle and allows you to earn in game credits in order to purchase new 'Mechs, or new Variants of the same mech. The current system at time of writing has 3 different tiers of Skill levels that you can unlock Passive bonuses to that 'Mech chassis. When you have unlocked all Tier 1 skills on 3 Variants of the same 'Mech, you unlock an Elite section of further bonuses. Unlocking all of those Elite bonuses on all 3 mechs will unlock an additional Module slot which allows you to add extra passive bonuses that can be earned, bought, or discovered from Supply Crates that are won during playing. The better you play, the more XP and Currency you earn. This enables you to unlock Module passives through the Pilot skill trees, as well as purchasing new weapons, new 'Mechs, and new Modules to equip. There are also several rotating ""Trial"" 'Mechs that you can pilot to get a feel for, but are unable to modify them in the Mechlab until you purchase one.MOVEMENT:The controls are not twitch based, though it is not slow, and depending on the size and weight of your 'Mech it will control much differently. Light 'Mechs are often lightly armored and speedy, built for scouting the front lines and providing target locks to the back line, and Assault 'Mechs are the heaviest, slowest, and largest with the most possible armor and weapon capacities. In between are Medium and Heavy respectively. Each has their own strengths, weaknesses, styles, and there are an incredible number of 'Mechs to choose from. You pilot the 'Mech like a tank where the top half can pivot and look around while you control the legs separately. This is all easily done with the WASD keys and a mouse, or you can play with the keyboard just like the old games.WEAPONS: 'Mechs come with specific hardpoints which limits the types of weapons and such that they can carry. These range from Ballistic to Missile to Energy weapons. You could have Variants of one 'Mech that offer different configurations and #'s of each of these or all one type. This allows different styles of gameplay while still using your favorite 'Mech. Missiles require a lock on target either by your own line of site, or another teammate ""Locking On"" for you. As long as a teammate has them targeted and visible, you and your team should be able to fire Long Range Missiles (LRM's) from the back line to whittle them down before engaging. Short Range Missiles will launch at much closer range, but do not require distance to become ""Armed"". Long Range Missiles will do little to no damage at close range in most situations.  Energy weapons consist of Lasers of Small, Medium, and Large variety. Within them are regular and Pulse as well as special Extended Range versions. Each of them has different damage, heat production, and cooldown time allowing for different playstyles. Ballistic weapons are often different types of cannons, or long range rifles. PPC's are a mix of Ballistic and Energy producing massive heat, but also high damage. SUMMARY: There is so much to talk about this game, but really if you want a giant robot fighting game with tons of customization, progression, teamwork, strategy, built in voice chat, and tons of fun please feel free to check it out! If you tell your team that you are just starting, they should give helpful pointers on how to stay alive, or which 'Mechs to shadow. At the very least, do what you can to support your Assault 'Mechs and make sure they can continue laying on damage to the enemy. There is also now a really great Tutorial and ""Academy"" missions you can access at anytime you think you need to brush up on Mechanics.I also encourage you to visit the No Guts No Galaxy podcast who streams from Twitch, has tons of Youtube videos of all the various 'Mechs, and also has it's own Discord server where people talk and group up for sessions of 'Mech warfare. Visit them @ www.twitch.tv/ngngtv and all their other social media links are there. See you on the Battlefield!			"

												I remember back when MWO was in early beta, for me it was crap back then, but now I really enjoy myself. Let me just say there are not enought mech vs. mech fighting games that put you into mock battles against players so when I decided to try this game out again as an avid AC fan I had to adjust to the slow more tactical movements and gameplay that make this game really enjoyable. And after a few hours of quickplay and freelancing for factions I got the hang of it. Though I still have one issue with the game and that is that besides faction and quickplay there is litterally no other way to play the game  (that I know of so far) and the wait to find a match is bloody long! They need to use the matchmaking system that 90% of fps games use (I.e. The pick a game type then when in game lobby pick map etc.) because half the time after waitng for 4 minutes to find a game in quickplay I got bored and signed out to play some other game. But if they fix this feature IMO the game would be 100x better.P.s. Hunchback for the win!			"

												The game borders between fun and rage-inducing. It hits so many elements of the mechwarrior universe on point but lacks some of the most important things that makes mechwarrior stand out from any other deathmatch game. Bases aren't bases. They aren't massive round dropships surrounded by a perimeter of turret defenses, repair bays, and vital facilities/objectives. No, your base is just a martian rover with a capture zone. Clan Wars, an attack/defense game mode, is so horribly broken that practically no one plays it. The recent updates to it just made it worse. Limitations on mech selection AND the obliterate-the-entire-team artillary aside, much of it can be attributed to bad map layout.I credit this game for being balanced. It has a massive selection of weapons, mechs, and equipment - free mechs, and mechs that cost over $50. Yet, you can still gain an edge over the cash-flush players with skills and the right loadout.But you can also BLATANTLY CHEAT with macros. Somehow this is still allowed! Exploit the game and alter your weapon firing rates using outside, third-party software to input commands into the game. Defenders of this say ""it doesn't affect dps"" or the advantage is negligable. It's still an attempt to gain an advantage and it alters the way the game was originally intended to be played. Make whatever excuses you want, you're cheating. I'm not too worried about these people because they're terrible and that's why they use macros in the first place.So is the game still fun? Yes, but only in QuickMatch mode. And only if you're lucky enough to not get stuck on a team full of complete pansies who hide behind rocks, fail to recognize enemy tactics, or offer strategy suggestions long after the opportunity to act has passed.The game looks and sounds good, is in continuous development - with new content frequently coming out, and can be fun with the right group of players. So, it's a love/hate thing.			"

												As a fan of Classic BattleTech, I play this game since December 2012.Sadly my mini-PC with STEAM is not powerfull enough for MW0.( Atom x5 with 4GB RAM & Intel HD Graphics = 4-16 FPS )I have to play it on my old MacBook Pro with a 650m GPU ![img] http://api.overwolf.com/users/Signature/rfw_gameplay.png [/img]Years ago I used OVERWOLF for playing MW0 with TeamSpeak ...... and I still play it with TeamSpeak, although without Overwolf now,as the ingame VoiceChat is BAD. Havent tried STEAM VoiceChat,are there any other MW0 players which can help me with it ?			"

												2 years experienced player, MechWarrior Online was the first title I came to on PC after being a five year long console gamer and it soon became the one single game I play on a regular basis. After my first year of casual play, I started to become a more competetive player and I became a spender on this title. I didn't feel like I needed to spend money on Mechs to be able to enjoy the game, I just decided I wanted to support the devs since this game felt like a major step up from the direction console gaming has been going in. As far as pay-to-win goes, you can pay to speed up progression with premium time, but that's about as far as it goes, everything else is mostly cosmetic or timed (exclusive with the exception of Hero Mechs), it's up to you wether that crosses the line or not.The dev team is very open with community feedback and does a fair job of keeping players up to date with their plans to improve the game, so there's almost always some new features to look forward to in the regular updates/patches. Gameplay wise, this is a very competetive title and a lot of information to take in and learn about. If you enjoy having long term thinking and strategic decision making in your shooters, this is for you. The learning curve is steep, but very enjoyable when you start to apply your knowledge in game as you fight your battles and even more fun is when you play with a group of friends and communicate information between one another.Overall, a unique and in-depth shooter experience and a nice change of pace from the usual fast paced run and gun type shooters most of us are used to from Triple A titles. Definitely recommended to give it a try and at the cost of free, all you have to lose is a couple hours you spend trying it out.			"

												I’ve always been a big fan of MechWarrior since the beginning.  It's year 2016 and this game has really outdated graphics and sound.  They are making millions of $ from in-game micro transactions, why not use some of that $ to improve the sound and graphics of this game.Pro: Great team based tactics game play, lots of customization for your mech.  Does not require to purchase mech to play, just jump in any game with pre-built trial mech.Con: Outdated graphics and sounds.  Because that department is lacking, it takes away from a true immersive experience of modern PC gaming.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoy mech battle goodness, it's very intense game play when squad or platoon go head to head.

												MechWarrior Online is a fun game as long as you dont expect it to be a completely immersive MMO. Its a build your own big stompy robot shooter.I have a lot more time played that Steam accounts for. I've been playing since 2012 off and on.Regardless of what you'll see some people lying about P2W it absolutely is not. You can go to metamechs.com and view the competitive tier mechs to prove this point.It does require a large time investment to get some of the largest mechs but you can do everything in the game for free. Paint jobs or ""Skins"" cost money just like many other F2P games however there is no actual benefit to doing so its purely cosmetic.Just join in talk with your team mates and play as a team or die solo. It is a great game.			"

 Purchase mechs with in-game or real currency.  Purchase upgrades for the mech with in-game currency. Purchase more ingame currency in the store using real currency.

												Oh, I forgot to mention this but it's important, the game has no aimbot detection. At all.Mechwarrior Online is a game plagued with problems. I backed and founded the game based on the strength of the franchise, but I'm going to bring up any of my personal disappointments and the only mention of the Transverse fiasco will be right here. I'm giving this game a negative review for a few reasons, but if current trends continue I may choose to recommend the game instead.PGI, when's the Flea coming out? It's been nearly two years since you announced it and MASC exists now. To whoever has the job of moderating the negative reviews, at least pass this question along when you moderate my review into oblivion.With this review I mostly wanted to point out that the game typically goes months without anything resembling a balance update. MWO also features a few HIDDEN mechanics specifically designed to punish new players who don't know about it. That mechanic is colloquially known 'Ghost Heat,' which causes your BattleMech to gain additional (and often excessive) amounts of heat if you fire more than an arbitrary number of one type of weapon. This is never explained anywhere in game, and while the game does have a 'heat warning' that pops up in the mechlab if you've taken too many of one type of weapon that warning is small and easy to miss.Up until about a month ago (over a year after MWO's launch) MWO was also completely without a tutorial, and the typical 'new player experience' was 'pick a trial `Mech at random, die three or four times without really understanding why, and uninstall the game.' If you didn't have a friend to show you the ropes or warn you about Ghost Heat or several of the other 'traps' (like LRMs currently being absolutely terrible weapons due to their slow speed, scattered damage, and tendency to ram into the nearest wall) you weren't going to make it very far.This has changed, the tutorial is actually pretty nice, and there are some bonuses to help new players buy a BattleMech quickly so they can start customizing and using actually good weapons and the latest balance patch (the first one in MONTHS) has brought back a close-range brawling playstyle that's actually quite fun, but that doesn't change the fact that all of this was done immediately before the Steam launch and that the buffs to close-range weapons will almost certainly be reverted.The real-money cost of BattleMechs is also completely absurd. They could cost a quarter what they do now and they'd still be expensive for a free-to-play game. An Assault BattleMech in MWO costs  Coupled with the fact that new releases often aren't balance-tested and aren't available for in-game currency for months after release means that new `Mechs are often pay-to-win, and due to the high prices (often approaching the cost of a AAA game for a `Mech pack or even a single Assault-weight BattleMech) this means that players who aren't shoveling their money directly into the furnace often become the punching bags of the players who are.You also, and this is a real killer for me, have to spend real money on Mechbays (at around $1.38 per bay) to even buy a `Mech at all. Now, the MC cost of a Mechbay ultimately isn't that high, but it's another 'hidden' cost slowly nickel-and-diming the userbase to death.MWO is a game best played with friends, and individual matches can be enjoyable once you get a handle on things. But the learning curve is steep even with a tutorial and you'll often waste tons of in-game C-Bills just trying things out. If you do play, my only advice is to save the 'Cadet Bonus' you earn over the course of your first 25 matches and buy a 55-ton Stormcrow. It's one of the most efficient `Mechs in the game and has access to the more powerful Clan versions of all the weapons, and will probably always be a good workhorse for grinding C-Bills in since it's fast enough to get to the fight and fast enough to get itself out of trouble.Once you've learned what 'trouble' actually looks like.

												I also briefly played in the betas before the game hit steam.  I was hoping the game would approve these past few years, but holy crap, it has not.So, when you start, you're given some trial mechs.  You then have to grind an ungodly amount of time before you can unlock them then progress down the trees.  I am *extremely* confused how the progression works, but it seems in order to use global XP you need to pay them real money.If you want to unlock many mechs at once, check out their site https://mwomercs.com/clans, it would only cost you $240.  Two.  Hundred.  Forty.  And you thought the DLC packs above were nuts.However, this isn't even half of the issues.  Try the game and hop into a match.  The first match I hopped into had ATLAS MECHS running around.  One of the most powerful mechs in the Battletech universe, in my first battle.  Needless to say my team got creamed.ALso, said Atlases were not stock.  They were customized.  So I was a new player, in a stock trial mech, thrown against guys with god knows how much time and money sunk into the game.  If this game has matchmaking, it is quite literally the worst I have ever seen.If I did something wrong, its fault again lies with the game, because after teaching you controls in the tutorial, it just throws you into the game expecting you to know how the tech tree and matchmaker works.

												Too much stuff behind the paywall.Maybe it is posible to grind, but realistically it is not.Nor is it posible to buy the game.The steam DLCs are not close to the whole game.And thats over 100 dollars.This game is a illusion.Hidden somewhere behind all the stuff you can not use.Having access to all the options that your oponents have is key.If for some reason you don't, you play half a game and switch sides.Everything else is just illusion of a fair fight.Truth is the fights are rigged in this game.Rigged by the fact that some players have the good/desired options, and some don't.Thus I do not recomend this game.

												I backed this game in 2012 due to my love of battletech. A love that this game has poisoned.As a gamer, is this a terrible game? No. It sorta works, there is some fun to be had here. The F2P model is terrible, its grindy and expensive. Worse than wargaming games. But if you throw away some money and grind forever, it can be fun. Sadly, the whole 'outfit your mech' doesnt work well here. You generally have to set your mech up with whatever flavor of the month builds are working to be competitive. If you end up wasting your hard earned cash on the wrong part and/or mech, you're in for a bad time. Even some of the paid stuff is garbage.As a battletech game, it is blasphemy. Nothing is right about this game, the devs know nothing about battletech. They just jumped on the license, hired someone else to make this game.. then fired those guys and went on to milk battletech fans for their money. Now they are here to milk you for your money. Seriously, go watch some of their videos. They are canadian car salesmen, not programmers or gamers. Ultimately, I hate this game, I hate the devs, and I hate the spineless legion of white knights who hold this turd up in the spotlight. Most positive reviews will come from these guys, they are all 500+ dollars in and they desperately do not want the game to die. They want you to play and will say anything to get you to play. They are sad broken people, and if you do get sucked into scam warrior online you will end up sad and broke as well.UPDATE: Just to be sure i tried the steam version. Some things are better than i remember, some things are worse. The most dissapointing issue is that groups of 2 are still put against groups of up to 9+. So if you want to play with just one friend, you are doomed to constant and quick defeats. And no, the devs will not fix this. This is INTENTIONAL. They are feeding you to their whales who have dropped $1000's into this game.Also the time to kill is way too low. You spend 90% of the time loading, and walking to the spot where you will die. This is not a ""thinking mans"" shooter.			"

												When I think of mechwarrior or battletech in general, I think of MechWarrior 4 Mercenaries. In my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the best mechwarrior game made period. This is not that. First of all it is F2P and P2W, I mean, you can earn the mechs and weapons the old fashioned way but this is going to mean a lot of work and grinding with and against people you do not like. This I think spoiles the point. The next major problem for me is that this is multiplayer. Multiplayer for me is a hinderance beacause 9 times out of 10, you are stuck playing against either the screaming 12 year old or that guy who sunk $100+ into the game to get everything and roflestomps everyone with one shot. Then there are the cheaters. This has all three which make the gameplay well, suck. The other problem with this is that there is no blasted story! In a universe that is as story rich as battletech, why can't the devs find or make up an epic story for this? All of the other games had a kick♥♥♥♥♥story, I referance you to all three mechwarior 4 games and mechwarrior 3 and the mechcommander games, and so on and so on. So much material that was not used, what a shame. And this brings me to the final hammerblow for me on this game. Take in the following characteristics, pay to win, glamorous graphics, and lazy or even non existant story writing and a lack of SP. What this game is, is  a money grab that is trying to pan-handle to the Call of Duty and Battlefield crowds to just make a quick buck. Whether or not this money is actually put into a future game that is worth playing or not is unknown but rather unlikely unfortunatly.			"

												I have been playing this game for over 3 years and decided to write this short review to warn people who are not into Battletech about this game.Before you start playing, mind the following:- the game is still in a beta stage in some ways (bugs, unfinished features, core features missing or badly implemented)- PGI (the developer) is more interested in your money than in delivering a good game (although the permanently claim the opposite)- PGI does not do much against cheaters and even does not react when they are presented proof (and there are too many cheaters)- the overall frustration level in MWO is quite high, especially if you are new to the game- since the player base is quite small for an MMO, the match-finding times can be very high (> 15min) for the main game mode- balance in match-making and concerning the BattleMechs and their weapons is not nearly as good as it could beSo why am I still playing this game and why did I give it a positive rating?- I am a Battletech fan and there simply is no other recent MechWarrior game- It's a good team-based game that favors working together over playing as a lone-wolf - It's NOT pay-to-win and to be an outstanding player, you need many skills (being a good shot is not enough!)Long story short: play if you are a Battletech fan, try if you like team-based games with substance, ignore it if you're expecting a mainstream game à la Call of Duty or Star Wars Battlefront.

												I'm gonna write this negative review, and then not reply to ANYONE that whishes to whiteknight this turd for no reason other than the fact that, in their hearts, they wish that they were space nazis with no parents.Look, I was there.  I played this game on a table top, where company-level games between two players took an hour for one turn, and I loved it.  I played many incarnations of Mechwarrior on the PC, from Cresent Hawks Inception the Mechwarrrior 4, and I loved it.  I was there in the early days of closed beta, when we still had all the goodies that Cryengine 3 could deliver, like inverse kinematics and all that, and I loved it.Now, like three years later, after launching a beta product as a general release, after not having more than two game modes between pick up death match and community warfare (and don't come back and say that there are three game modes in public death match, they all boil down to skirmish in the end), I have absolutely no reason to believe that this product is anything more than a shameless cash grab aimed at the absolute bottom of the gamer community, one that thought that the previous games were too ""hard"" or too ""niche"", as made by a developer that has a track record of making bare-bones minimum viable products, or as we like to call it for short, SHOVELWARE.This guy Russ, whom I hope I can run into in real life on the streets of Seattle one day just so I can cry in his face about how he♥♥♥♥♥♥♥one of my favorite IPs and got away with it, is so desperate for good reviews he has to beg players to start Steam accounts just so they can thumbs up this crap even if they have no intention of playing it on Steam, is nothing more than a craven raider of popular titles, and he figured he hit some real pay dirt with the Battle Tech license, didn't you Russ?TLDR; This is a beloved robot combat simulator dumbed down into a mediocre arcade shooter, play if you want, but try not to spend any money on it.  That is the one good point, you don't have to spend money on it if you are patient and have very little life outside videogames.			"

												The basic problems of the game is the same as with almost every free to play game on the steam marketplace: You might have some fun, but you're at a competitive disadvantage to anyone with a credit card powerup. You could have the best reflexes, great internet, great computer, intelligence and deep skill... but one swipe of the card and it's meaningless. This is a pay to win game, like all the others. Below, I'll explain the particulars of how this game executes the model. .Your first 25 matches give you huge amounts of 'c-bills', the main in-game currency. But after that, regardless of how good you are, you won't make more than 200k per match. Realistically, you can expect to make 50-130k, depending on skillset and build choices for your mech.  Most of the mechs you will want cost about 8-16mil for the chassis. Triple that to fit it up decently. A match will run you about 18 minutes a pop, assuming you are doing it during peak hours -- the queue times can be in the minutes range outside of that window, and 85% of the player base is N. American.  So the breakdown is, you can blow 5 hours a night and get in about 15 matches during that. That'll give you about 1.5mil. So basically, once a week you can afford to get another mech. There are about a hundred. And there are an average of about 4 variations for each. To use them well, you need to buy 3 of each chassis, and skill them up. The goal here is to get a set of 4 mechs that you can use to bring to community warfare; So you will need to grind a minimum of 12 mechs, selling 8 of them, to accomplish this. That's about 3 months of grinding every night, 5 hours a night, to be competitive in community warfare..Which brings me to our next problem: Community warfare without a dozen friends is like going to a sausage party. Those few who do this make millions of c-bills an hour grinding out maps. Everyone else is just scrubs -- no matter how good you are, you're going to lose. And that's the main selling point of the game over previous mechwarrior games. So you either spend 3 months grinding so you can have a *chance* at winning -- and the load out that one of those aforementioned groups will take you in on -- or you whip out your credit card and take the express lane to the desert of community warfare..By desert, I mean... there are a couple matches every hour during peak times. If you just want to play with random strangers who have no idea what they're doing, and will often suicide themselves just to get to the next match faster... you can skip community warfare. But if that kind of playstyle is aggravating to you, and teamwork is what you really want to be a part of, this is the best mechwarrior online has to offer. .And it ain't much. "

PROS: Free mech simulator. It really seems like you're controlling a mech. CONS: The idea of the game is nice, but the gameplay isn't that fun, and controling a mech can be a bit complicated sometimes. New players will probably take a while until they get used to the controls.______The idea is cool, but I got bored after playing this for half an hour. In my opinion, it's a great mech simulator, but not a great game.			"

												I played this a bunch when it was new. It recently arrived on Steam and I elected to pick it up again to see if it had changed any over the years. On a technical level, the game is pretty decent. It's visually pleasing, plays smooth, has excellent balance and controls that can be picked up quickly. THere are a few bugs that pop up from time to time, but mostly they are contained to the tutorials and control mapping. Joystick support seems like a cruelly halfwitted afterthought due to how much more simplified and twitch-response oriented the game has become over the years, but the game otherwise plays like a slightly clumsy FPS with a usual mouse and keyboard. But there's something significant that it's missing. I can't quite put my finger on it, but allow me to try to explain. The whole thing consists of nothing but an endless series of pick-up fights lasting less than 10 minutes each on average, with exactly zero control over the scenario beyond ""Which chassis do I want to use (which you pick before you know where and what you're going to play) and do I want to be a commander or not"".  Game types are semi-randomized, as are maps. You play for hours on end and the only thing you feel is fatigue; you don't really feel like you've accomplished anything. The devs have done an acceptable job of keeping the game off of a pay-to-win scale, which has really become more of a pay-to-not-grind system. WHile this is an improvement, to be certain, it still feels hollow. I used to play MechWarrior 4 competitively. This was obviously a long time ago, and the game feels less like a simulator now and more like a MOBA with robots. If youy are among the multitudes who love MOBAs, you should give it a try. It's free, it's easy and quick to pick up, and certainly offers a huge number of possibilities. It's just that, like DotA, like Smite, like LoL, there's no story to speak of and none of those possibilities really feels even remotely meaningful.			"

Posted: December 11, 2015
												A good deathmatch game for those who enjoyed the mech combat side of previous mechwarrior titles. It offers the best online mech vs. mech combat of any game so far but it is not without its flaws. If you are looking for a deep campaign system with role-playing and long-term strategic planning then you should probably look elsewhere. However if you enjoy good old giant stompy robots blowing the %#!@ out of each other in arena settings then this  probably a good game to try for free, especially if you have played other similar titles such as World of Tanks or Armored Warfare.Pros• The most deep and detailed mech combat system of any online mech game.  It is very fun once you understand what you are doing and it's the primary reason so many players stayed through the bugs and flaws of the original game. • There is a huge range of mechs and a very deep customization system that offers a lot of options for tinkerers and collectors.• The game should feel familiar and easy to pick up for those who have played games like World of Tanks.  In addition the grind and financial aspects of the game are considerably less. • The game rewards skill. Paying money can save you time and give you more mechbays, but it will not give you any significant advantage over other players.  • The first mechwarrior title since 1989 that has actually included the original 3025 battlemechs. • Despite considerable changes from the tabletop, it is the closest any mechwarrior title (to this date) has been to replicating its feel and tactics. • In comparison with other online games, the community tends to be more mature and friendly on average.   • You can play on any of the worldwide servers (North America, Europe, Southeast Asia / Oceania) with the same account. Cons• Despite the grind being considerably less than other similar titles, it is still present.• The game runs on cryengine3  which is not the most stable or efficient of online platforms. • The game still has a number of minor bugs and balance issues to be fixed and the developers are often slow to react to this.• Outside of arena battles the game doesn't offer much of a campaign mode. The community warfare mode (still in beta at the time of this review) is fun for short periods but it hasn't been developed nearly enough to be considered a fully functional feature. • Because it is a heavily skill focused game, the game also punishes making bad decisions. This can make it more difficult for people who just want to play casually and not worry about using their best mechs all the time. • The game uses an inefficient matchmaking system that results in longer wait times than necessary.

												Been playing this game for almost 2 year before Steam release and all I got to say is you won't find a better balanced F2P 1st/3rd person mech game then MWO. Don't listen to people who try to give this game a bad rep, they're just butthurt.MWO does has it's flaws but what game doesn't.Mech packs are on the the $$$ side but that's your option to spend your money on whatever you want or don't.Pro tips for newbs: 1.Aim for legs on light mechs and try to hit the back on big mechs their armor is weak most of the time there. 2.People sometimes store their ammo in the legs or arms so shoot there and hope it causes the ammo to blow up and crit it.3.Don't let one part of your mech take all the hits, torso twist to spead the damage all over so you can fight longer.4.Do reseach on a mech before you buy it because it might not fit your playstyle.

												Do not buy the overpriced mech packs in this game. Absolute waste of money. Not disclosed at all that the mechs you are getting are laughably unbalanced garbage with asymmetrical loadout possibilities and, as an example, all your weapons stacked onto one arm. Unable to even purchase mechs you are interested in, confusing menus. Wish I qualified for a refund.			"

If you like playing icons like the Twolf and Dwolf, and Hellbringer you will be sorely disappointed. PGI almost always panders to the IS player base and neglects the clans to the point right now most clan players don't even drop Community Warfare anymore. Overall if you are looking for a lore based game you will be extremely unhappy. I would play a lot with trial mechs before you give PGI any money.			"

												Review from someone playing since Open Beta:In its current state: 7.5 / 10This game is good and fun, not balls-to-the-wall astonishingly amazing, but it has the potential to reach those levels.Fact is, at the moment, this is the only Battletech game we've got, and It's a damn decent one. ** A word of warning about the bad reviews: Many of these are salty old players who have not taken ANY time to re-examine the current state of the game** /end warning----Visual/Audio------Audio - 8/10  Sound design could be a bit beefier, I'm actually a fan of the audio that USED to be in the game (weapon SFX and stuff). I've always been hoping for dynamic music that changes based upon your situation, but that's a pipedream. What we have now is pretty good nonetheless.Visuals - 7/10 I'm not someone who cares about the highest quality textures, details, etc... BUT they could be better, plus the game is poorly optimized. I find it hard to believe the reccommended specs on the Store Page. The game used to look much better, search for screenshots, but performance was worse.------Gameplay------Teamwork is key in this game, afterall, there is no FFA. If you lonewolf expexting to kill lots of things, you'll be dissappointed. Use voip, use chat, move with your team. This is slower than Hawken, and certainly much different from your average resoawn-die-respawn-die twitch shooters. It really is a ""thinking man's shooter"" You have to think who to shoot, when to shoot, where to shoot on them, IF you even SHOULD shoot, have situational awareness, be aware of heat, weapon mounts, target locks, friendly location...the list goes on. Teamwork is key in this game, afterall, there is no FFA. If you lonewolf expexting to kill lots of things, you'll be dissappointed. Use voip, use chat, move with your team. All in all: blasting mechs feels fun.------The Grind--------Certainly not a grindy as other F2P games out there, but there is still a grind. That being said, it is now MUCH better than it used to be, with increased ingame rewards, and Faction Play paying out much more than it used to. Grinding for mechs becomes addicting (for me anyway). ------Pricing--------Yes, DLC, MC, and mech packs (for real money) are expensive. They have been, and I don't think that will change. The main reason people spend money on this game is because they have cash to burn, or people like me, who want to see the Battletech IP survive to fight another day. It is good to know that Steam DLC can go on sale. All in all, if you are a fan of Battletech, or big stompy robots, you owe it to yourself to give this game a try. I like it, you might too.			"

Also, had the developers brought the game up to present day standards of graphics. Like all games of late, this one got lost in the pay to win barrier. Instead of focusing on bringing new content and keeping the player base it had. Expansions with mechs would have been a better market approach than a buy a mech or grind out your mech goal till your death. Like most gamers, I'm not going to throw tons of cash at a game, for pixels, just to have the latest and greatest mech. * Faction warfare is very dead in this game. You would have to copletely make a raid with friends. That is if you even have friends that play this game.  "

												I could do the whole angry saga thing and rip into them since their inception since that is how long I have been with this game but I will limit this to a few key points. One; This company has no idea on how to balance their game. This gaming community has been after them year after year and still they ignore everyone and implement things like map voting which noone wants. Two; They have a have hired a online cheerleeders to pose as ""interested gamers"" to make ""quality podcasts"" so that they can drive up sales of online mechs. Three; They only care about the community when they are about to shut down the game anything else they could give a crap less about. Clan warfare has been stagnant without updates for 2 years, 1 new map a year, and no new content other than what you have to pay for since this game got clan warfare.Do yourself and your wallet a favor do not make any purchases on this game. It came to steam to die a horrible death funding it will put it on life support that much longer.  "

												An awesome continuation of the famouse Mech Warrior francise.The game feels good, a mid-level gaming laptop can handle it on almost highest settings at a solid 60fps, and it seems to be free to play with some microtransactions for visual change.The developers are constantly doing events that give a lot of rewards, including some that you can get only using real money. New mechs are added every month or so, with the huge patches that improve, or fix issues in the game(performance or otherwise).There are also some other small flaws, like alt-tabbing and when getting back to the game and press shift it opens the steam cloud window(aparently it saves keys pressed), and some of the mechs from my favorite MW3 are not here(yet) *cry*.Overall a great game that you should give it at least a few days of play!

												As one of the original 'Founders' I wish I could recommend this game, but it should be avoided in its current state.The major problems that I face with this game is that after 4 years of development it feels like its in Early Access/Beta. Where the devs dont fully seem to grasp the I.P they have. Changes made to the game usually seem ill thought out and never fully implemented. It's common to buy a new Mech Pack but for it's stats to be nerfed a few months later, community feedback is often ignored.This game does not have a Campaign, and lacks any decent missions. At present you have two mods, a quick play mode and a Faction Warfare mode where you can bring four mechs to Battle. However, the game lacks substance.And worst of all, there is a growing toxic community to this game. Although a team based game you will feel the urge to turn off VOIP due to some of the more toxic elements of the community.This game has great potential, and maybe in 4 years time that potential could be realised, but until then stay clear and find something else to enjoy.

												I've played this game a couple hundred hours since it was in beta.  I'm glad this is on Steam now because I've had problems with the standalone client when trying to move between hard drives or updating operating system.I would describe it like a cross between an FPS and tank battle sims.  You can shoot and destroy individual components on enemy mechs which destroys any weapons or loadout items stored in them. There are a few things you can buy which give advantage like special consumables or specific mechs which let you earn currency faster (but they mostly aren't top tier mechs), but honestly it doesn't make enough of a difference to detract from gameplay and doing well without them is no issue if you have a good loadoutHeavy mechs have the best balance of firepower and mobility and are the most popular.  Assault mechs have the most firepower and armor but have awful mobility. For new players medium mechs might be best to get used to the controls (my personal fav mech is a specific medium mech with a ton of hardpoints that makes it like a glass cannon). Light mechs are the hardest to use but can be gamechanging in the hands of a veteran for component sniping, taking down damaged or overextended mechs and point capturing.Different weapons include hitscan lasers of various range and type, ballistic cannons, railguns for sniping, close and long range missiles, electronic warfare.If you're new google the smurfy mechlab to play test loadouts and look up Meta Mechs for mech tier lists and some good loadouts to get you started. Also look up theB33f on youtube for some funny MWO vids			"

I appreciate the fact that I can play the game and have fun despite my lack of twitch skills.  It is a bit daunting for new players, especially if you don't have and background in the Battletech universe, but there is a good community behind this and lots of help to be found online.I have spent more time in this game than any other, probably by a factor of 10 in 30 years of gaming.

												I have been playing the game since closed beta in 2012. There have been ups and downs for the game, but I have enjoyed the game over since I started playing. I am glad that they have gone to Steam, it is a chance for them to broaden the player base. It is a chance for them to add more content to the game. Is MW:O everything I had hoped for it to be? Not yet at least. But it is an enjoyable experience for me to be able to play in the Mechwarrior universe. I can't wait to see what they do from here.			"

												Gameplay is good. Costs a lot to enjoy it though. Career path is unclear and after playing for 7 hours I got a penalty to my earnings for 7 days because I didn't know I was choosing a faction. So I'll check back in later since it's a free game. But I'm not spending any money, don't see the value yet.			"

												Most excellent and satisfying mech simulator out there, with tons of nuance and a real feel of controlling a large weighty machine.

Richer combat options than the tank games, and a lot less arcady than other mech games, this is Battletech, pure and simple.			"

												I hadn't heard about this game. I loved everything to do with Mech Warrior and Mech Commander, thought I'd love this, but I got so frustrated on the quick fire tutorial, because I had quit the tutorial and when I came back I couldn't get the same mech. The mechs they gave you as trials couldn't fire fast enough to finish the challenge, so I just quit the game. Not interested in purchasing a mech with cash so I can finish the tutorial. LOL!			"

												I have played this game since open  Beta in 2012, over 5000 matches.  It has slowly evolved over that time and continues to evolve.  I appreciate the fact that I can play the game and have fun despite my lack of twitch skills.  It is a bit daunting for new players, especially if you don't have and background in the Battletech universe, but there is a good community behind this and lots of help to be found online.I have spent more time in this game than any other, probably by a factor of 10 in 30 years of gaming.

												Pros: Good Fun & Simple Stupid Shooter people pretend to have tactics in to make them feel like like they are strategic.Cons: Completley Garbage UI, jumbled assets with no order, randomly ordered set of skills, unmannagable menu, bad music, limited and completely crap hardpoints made by people that never played Mech Warrior, Confusing Interface Menu, Bad Garrage, Bad optimisation, Aim Bots, No Anti-Cheat, Pay-to-Win for sure, Mechs not based on Tons just Hardpoints, Goofy ""Skills"" that are really just equipment, Bad Weapon Sounds, Overly Grinding if you dont buy a Premium, Terrible Looking Cockpits, Bad Graphics Overall, Everything is Death Match. No cheat protection either so tons of people hack and cheat all day.Note: This game has the stupidest people on the planet playing in it. This is ment in the most litteral sense one can imagine. Every third person suffers from Aspergers, torrets, or some form of fetal alcohol syndrome in MWO. Cowards are abundant. Cowards hide in clusters behind one building and NEVER win a match. Its a fact that if you are agressive in an FPS game, and want to destroy a team of people hiding in a cluster behind a building that are sharing stories about their toenail polish, that you will win. (If you see people acting like they are digga-digga, talking like a Hue-Hue from Texas, or hiding in one tight group behind the same building or hill, you should instantly charge out into the enemy and kill yourself. You should do this with 100% certainty that the match is not in your favor from the start and your team will fail. Die, leave the match, select another mech, and play again. It will save you time and fustration in the long run, I assure you.)The only real problem I see is how slow this game is and how many aim botters there are. It takes a long bit of time to find a match in Faction type settings. In quick play, you dont really do much besides shoot and kill. There are objective missions, but they dont really end up being more than brawls anyhow which is EXACTLY what I like about Mech Warrior. I hated escort missions so anything other than those is a welcomed presence in the Mech Warrior Universe.Mech combat feels fine like mech combat. I will say the weapons are all VERY low damage in this game VS weapons from the 'actual' Mech Warrior games. Ever crit with an Gauss or ER-PPC to someones head in a game? They die. In MWO, that wont really happen. Its impossible, in fact, to one shot even light mechs with a million cred weapon. Which makes everytihing a fun little fight, albeit dragged out extensively. The game is mostly timesink but it doesnt really destroy the fun too much.The layout is a confusing b1tch. I dont really think these guys worked too hard on menus or directions/hints of where everything was located. You have (if you are new to the game) a long long time ahead of you sorting through how to navigate the menus and where everything is. Id say about an hour, and even then I suspect you will be sorting through it long after that as you discover this and that. The menu almost feels like a game itself...choose your own adventure?Im very critical about games. I can say that if you dont like death match, Mech Brawling, and non-escort type combat, then this is better suited for shelfing or avoiding.If you like such games, then this is for you. Works great with track IR and Mech-Joystick configs. Also works with VR.			"

												This a a must for anybody who has played any Mechwarrior game in the past. There are pro's and cons. It does take a while to unlock certain mecs unless you pay, but it can be done, easily compared to other ""FTP"" games. At first the system seems daunting and weird, but after a couple of hours you know which mech you want and you strive to purchase your own, customize it, drive it and wtch your mark into your chosen clans history,Lore wise the game is spot on, graphics and gameplay are spot on, and believe me, get a commander confident enoguh and you'll feel a sense of comradare unprallelled in any other game.As somebosy who has played this pre steam and hasn't spent a dime, it's well worth your time!

												Hello MechWarriors!I decided to share my expirience from playing MWO for almost 3 years. This game isn't easy one and it was even harder back then. It's learnig curve is steep. For 1st week I was able to play for 30 minutes a day and rage quit after being wasted so quick in 100 ton Atlas. But I love Battletech so next day I was coming back to learn how to pilot trial 'mechs (3 years ago trials were stock 'mechs without good equipment, very very frustrating expirience. Now you have Champion trials that are almost meta equiped). After 25 metches with Cadet Bonus I had enougt C-Bills to buy my first own 'Mech. I decided to go for Stalker 85 ton assault 'mech and it was good decision because I still play Stalkers today and totaly love this chasis. This is how my adventure with this game started.Soon I realized I like this game so much I woudl like to suport developers with $$$ and boost my c-bills account so I decided to buy my first hero 'mech with 30% earning bonus. I found Flame (heavy Dragon 'mech) to be intresting back then but I don't recomend it now ;).Then I met nice people by killing them first and than teaming with them next drop and real fun started. This game teastes better when played with funy/crazy people and voice chat. So see you on the battlefield!			"

												Giant stompy robots! While lacking the single player of past mechwarrior titles this one makes up for it with a very tight muliplayer experience. Community warfare brings some Lore aspects into the game while providing a different pace than the public cues. Blast your enemies with Lasers, missles and cannons. Watch them do the same to you as your arms fall off and cockpit overheats with steam as you try and get the last hit in before your mech falls to peices. Lots of fun.			"

												Been playing the game since Closed Beta, few times felt like taking a break but never did. The game has been through lots of ups and downs, balance issues through the years. The game and UI is feeling very balanced at the moment. One of the bigger issues as I see it is the new player grind, especially if you follow the F2P model. If you follow the sales and do your homework on mech selection you can set yourself up pretty good in the $30 / $80 range.Mechwarrior has quite the cult following and the http://www.battletech.com information databases are very complete.Handy Linkshttp://www.sarna.net/wiki/Category:BattleMechs_by_weight_class --- Sarna Websitehttps://www.reddit.com/r/OutreachHPG/new --- Reddit OUTREACHhttp://metamechs.com --- MetaMechs Sitehttp://mwo.smurfy-net.de --- Smurfy's Prototypinghttp://snafets.de/mwo/quirks.htm --- Snafet's Quirkshttp://www.battletech.com --- BattletechAlaric V \ XPND			"

												The game is fun, buying with RL money can get expensive quickly if you let yourself go. I have 2 different mechs. 3 Variants of each and im having plenty of fun though. You get to run about 3 different trial mechs of each weight class to see what you like running. Light, medium, and heavy play very differently. I felt a bit underpowered in a trial mech but most of that was not knowing my ranges and how i needed to approach enemies. I could do fine in one now. The biggest thing about starting with a free trial mech is you cant change the build and that to me is where a lot of the fun lies. Most startup builds on a mech are garbage. I ended up buying one of the steam packs and it was ok. I wish I would have just bought a mastery pack for like 28 bucks instead from the Mechwarrior website. My drawback comes from the pricing of all the content. The game should be one of the best games on the market if people are paying those prices for everything. There is a page like others have said with a 500 dollar gold mech. If you charge 500 bucks for basically a look on a character, bot, whatever, the bottom line is you are most definitely a money grabbing SOB. Soooo I say if you like mechs and big♥♥♥♥♥lasers and feeling like a badass pilot every time your rig fires up go for it. If you have trouble controlling your spending on extra content and you have that itch when you see something on a market that looks cool as hell and you have to have it and you can't force down that wallet hand stay away... as far away as you can possibly get.

												As a Battletech board game player I was curious to see the FPS online version and in 2 weeks I was negatively impressed by this game. I have 30 hours on record of which 1, maybe 2 were played and 28 wasted between loading times, watching others play, and trying to find a match. I've mistakenly bought a Clan Mech with the light mech package but then picked an Inner Sphere Career and I could never use it... Piranha refused to reimburse me for a mech I can't use and can't sell. They didn't even give me the credits back to buy a different mech with. It's totally absurd.Out of a hundred matches, my team (inner sphere) may have won 10 at best... index of a poor conversion in balancing between the IS and Clan pros/cons. I have possibly experienced the worst netcode in the world (beats Battlefield 4 and says it all) and on top of that, there's apparently no anticheating protection (Punkbuster). I cannot explain in any other way the impossible things that take place in combat... where a medium mech can take dozens of hits from me and my teammates then kill me in an assault mech with just 2 hits. ... and it happens all the time.The system is apparently evolving around credits (split in 3 different components) with which you buy modules, weapons and other goodies. This means the new player is at complete disadvantage against more experienced players not for a matter of skill, tactics and experience but by sheer mech quality difference: It means to be at disadvantage for MONTHS against your opponents, no matter how well you play or which mech you're using.I am not going to waste my time to get on par with other players in a game that starts with these premises, especially after Piranha behaved like that with me. Saying my evaluation is below negative is an understatement.			"

												Let's just get this out of the way right here, right now: this game is *hard.* Hard to understand for most folks, hard to play by the same, and most definitely hard to fully and truly master. If you love giant freakin' robots with lasers, giant guns, and rockets pouring out the ears, this'll be your cup of tea for sure.But if you're going the free-to-play route, you're going to have an uphill slog ahead.See, buying any pack of 'mechs whatsoever gives you a leg-up on getting the purchased 'mechs mastered. If you've read the reviews of some other players, you'll know what this means: getting three variants of the same 'mech chassis, just to grind experience on them so you can unlock all their upgrades on the skill tree in order to up their performance in the field. And MWO is going to be one hell of a grindfest; you'll be grinding for C-Bills to purchase new 'mechs, grinding those 'mechs in the field so you can get their performance upped, and grinding General XP so you can unlock beneficial modules that'll keep you on the game and competitive.Trust me when I say that just cause' my record *says* so many hours, it's oh so much more than that. And let's just say that I was on well before they introduced Trial 'mechs that were ""optimized"" (read: upgraded and given a weapons loadout that compliments them).All in all you really should go in loving giant stompy war machines in order to get any mileage out of this game. And start learning to be sociable too: you'll want to be in a group of players you trust and play beside frequently in order to pierce the heavy metal veil that is Community Warfare. To those of you interested and playing; keep at it and don't give up. Bite the bullet and keep at the controls. Oh, and hit the academy, the lessons'll help a lot. Because after all this struggle, the first time you core an enemy Assault 'mech after a hard fight against it? It's likely gonna feel like an accomplishment, like you yourself managed to bring down a titanic 80+ ton bipedal war machine of death and destruction. Yes, even if you had help from your teammates!Now for the record: I recommend you *try* MWO at least before you judge it, as in *really* try it. Don't just struggle through a few matches, give up, and delete it from your Steam library either; like I said, it takes time to get used to this circus and the troupe of monkeys (BattleMechs) you need to train.

												When the game first showed up couple of years ago, I tried it out with high expectations as a big BattleTech fan, and fan of massive robots in general. It didn't work out. Game was removed within few weeks.Then, about two months ago, I saw someone streaming it on Twitch (thanks Gimpy21!), and decided to give it one more shot - it's been a long time. And oh boy, did things change (for the better). TL;DR - This is as much fun with 'mechs as one could have at the moment, and that says a lot. Mind you, this game does require you to think more than rely on your reflexes and mouse DPI, and is most definitely not your regular FPS. Each mech is special, and it might take a long time to get accustomed to various options, loadouts - even before digging into what's meta. Experiment, have fun with stompy mechs, and know that your mechs WILL get killed MANY times. However, each time you get to learn what went wrong, and you can't wait to begin firing alphas again (no, seriously, don't do that as a newbie ;)).I encourage new players to visit official forums for incredibly helpful guides, and aside from written stuff there are plenty of embedded YouTube tutorials to help anyone and everyone - if you decide to dive in. Ignore the toxic comments, and enjoy many mature players who are there to help you out and have fun with mechs.Highly recommended title - feel free to ask for any details I might be able to answer. Tip: As a newbie and without a group of teammates, avoid playing Faction portion of the game (Community Warfare) at the very start. Also avoid buying mechs/mech packs with real money until you've gotten a good grip of what style and chassis you like to play. Also bear in mind that you really don't have to pay a single cent of the real money to progress in this game and buy mechs, nor does paying real money for mechs make you play better in any way.			"

												Really fun game, but may be a little bit of a rough start for newer players.Many of the players seem to be veterans of the older versions of the Mechwarrior franchise. Combine this with having to understand how to build your own mech, and it can be a little confusing for someone who is newer. My advice would be to play the guided training. Once you have that down, start experimenting with different builds so you can understand how to balance armor, firepower, ammo, heat management, etc...Overall, it's a blast to build and customize your own mech and then fight with it.9/10 "

												Played the Game from Closed Beta. This is one of those game you will have a Love / Hate relationship with. It had Lots of Lore to it. By Lore I'm it started out as a Pen and Paper Table top game back in the Mid 1980's, Tons of Rules book, Novels, a Cartoon. All based  in BattleTech, Mechwarrior is a Very small Part of a Much Bigger Universe game wise. There are two Tech Faction to the game Inner Sphere (I.S.) and the Clans. (You will want to Learn the Differences  in them) There are 6 I.S. factions in game, And 4 Clans Factions. So it a 10 Way war. Solo queues you only have other Solo Player with in 2 Tiers of you. (Tier 5 being the Lowest, Tier 1 being the highest)PGI has been working very hard to keep the game Balanced. So there are always Minor changes happen to gear & Mechs to help bring them inline if Over Powered or Under Powered. Many People will claim it pay to win every time a New Mech is add to the game this is False. Here how they do it.1. About 3months out they will put a Mech or Mechs Packages up for sell. Real Cash outside the game store normal with some modules or Paint pattern for free or more add it for Buying Early2. The Mech get patch in to the game for those with the Package.3. About 3 weeks after the Mech getting it game it go up for MC (Real Cash in game store)4. About 3 weeks after MC patch it go on sell for C-Bills the in game Cash you earn every game you play. PGI also put on Event almost every Month where you can Earn Free Mechs, MC, Modules, Color and Patterns. No Weapon are behind Pay walls, (they are divided between the Two Tech Faction) Clan stuff can only go on Clan Mechs, and I.S. Stuff can only go on I.S. Stuff.There is in game Voice so ask questions if you need help. So go to the MWOMercs website to learn Much more about the game.The Learning Curve for this Game is VERY HIGH so it will take time to learn.  "

												It's the MechWarrior IP. if you grew up in the 90's you probably played these and there's nothing quite like it out there. Lots and lots of depth and strategy for what is essentially a FPS, and the learning curve is very challenging. Teamwork and patience is the key to rewarding gameplay. It's purportedly Free to Play, but the grind is really like any other game of this type, so getting some DLC for $20 or more is usually worth it, as long as you do your research.Developer is active but doesn't have the resources of having a big publishing house behind it, so fixes come slowly but it's pretty well polished for now.

												Thought I'd simplify my review because nobody likes a block of text. Still has the same points. Firstly- this is not a review on the developer. Just a review on the game itself. If you want dev drama, look elsewhere. The simplest way to put MechWarrior: Online is... it delivers some but not all of what you want in a MechWarrior game. And so much of it is subjective. It delivers enough to be a fun, relatively high quality mech shooter using fairly refined yet arguably simplified MechWarrior mechanics. It caters more towards the modern F2P competitive shooter crowd than previous MW games, and is more of a shooter than it is a sim. On those grounds alone, then yes, I recommend the game. Especially if you're a BT fan in any way- it's free, you're not losing anything by giving it a shot. It isn't all that you want in a MechWarrior game... but it's enough for now.			"

												I was a fan of Mechwarrior ""back in the day,"" and played a lot of Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries. Honestly, this game captured a lot of that feeling for me. It's not as deep, but at the same time the learning curve is a little bit easier, too. If you're on the fence about whether or not you should pick this game up, I challenge you to beat the price. Even if you only play it for two hours and put it down, you paid exactly $0.00.New players have access to trial mechs so you don't have to worry too much about being overmatched right out the gate. Things can get a little grindy after you've played your first 25 matches (and gotten a huge bonus for each one), but it doesn't feel terribly unfair. Even if you're consistently on the losing side and a terrible player, you'll usually make some C-Bills.There are only three things I don't like about this game, and they're pretty minor:1. Absolutely no cosmetic customization options are currently available (15December2015) without paying some real money. You can't so much as change your paint job without spending real money. Not a big deal to me, but not something I feel like spending real dough on, you know?2. The pricing is a little predatory. You don't get a lot of virtual currency for your real cash - it's like Zynga designed their pricing scheme.3. I don't feel like this is a pay to win game. I've won plenty without spending a dime! However, the people who are willing to dish out real money can get a definite advantage if they want it, loading themselves out with premier mechs and equipment. Skill is still a huge factor, and a good ""free"" player will still usually do fine, but it can be a little annoying watching a Hero-level Timber Wolf walking around the map... it's like watching that guy who got into a prestigious college because his dad bought them a new library.

When I was a newbie, I played for 1 month with trial mechs. After that month, I would recommend you buy 3x  Hunchbacks or 3x Griffins with what you earned from the Cadet Bonus and Elite them. These mechs will teach you how to Torso Twist.Pros:>> Lots of customization>> Not yet a pay-to-win game. I have never felt it to be like that.>> It is highly rewarding to break mech faces.Cons: >> Faction Warfare is dead.>> Gameplay can be unforgiving for new players.>> A lof of grinding - which is very difficult if you are just beginning.Good luck and have fun!

It's on the right track and I've been playing since closed beta so I've been around a while.Would highly recommend, and recommend you don't judge the game immediately as the learning curve is rather steep; but once you get the hang of it, you will enjoy some mech blasting fun!8.5 out of 10 for me, but I'm also a pen and paper table top veteran from the 80's :)			"

												You like big stompy robots? You like fighting with robots? You like heavy customination?Well then this game is for you.It's not pay 2 win as some people may say. Getting C-bills is easier with trial mech and I got my first kill with the trial mech.Controlling your mech can be hard so playing throught the tutorial is better choice. Once you finish it's time to battle other mechs.So far I seen no OP mech...every mech seems balanced from my viewpoint. Light can go against mediums ,but can't go against heavies or assault mechs and so on because they have little armor.This game is all about teamwork. You get points for spotting,saving other mechs and so on. It is heavly tactical meaning you won't go in run and gunning. You have to watch your HUD all the time to make sure that you have a chance of surviving this war.What can I say? I like this game already			"

												A friend got me into this game quite some time ago, and I had a blast with it.  Don't let the time on steam fool you since I've been playing for 50 to 100hrs of game time, potentially more.  In short, MechWarrior Online (MWO) is an interesting game where you get to pilot your own X ton robot to blow the crap out of other people piloting their own X ton robot.  The game can be fast or slow, depending upon what type of team you get into.  Members of the community can be a mixed bag where you'll get some helpful veteran players or jerks.  What drew me into MWO wasn't the aspect of it being free, but the depth to which you can customize your playthrough.  Mechs that have light tonnage can be extremly fast and agile.  This lends itself to a quick playthrough, but you're a walking target since armor is quite limited.  On the other end of the spectrum would be Heavy/Assault.  Do NOT confuse the two as Assault mechs are the heaviest class of mechs (the Atlas being a primary example), and these boys do some serious damage with heavier firepower.  Overall, I would give the game a shot, however, I will give some word of caution.  This isn't an FPS game where you run in guns blazing to take down every single enemy in sight.  It's a more tactical approach where you have to isolate targets and attack as a coordinated group.			"

												First off, I have around 500+ hours on this game and have played since beta(I wrote this review a few weeks before this game was released on steam but most almost everything is still true)This game is super underrated, especially in the state it's in. There are no real advantages to paying except for the fact that you can get hero mechs that just have different hard-points than the 3-5 variants of that specific mech... as if there wasn't enough varietyThey've added new game modes, a much better tutorial that actually rewards you, and a ton of new mechs with tons more to come.I have to admit, the game is extremely difficult to learn, it can take 3+ matches just to properly work the move mechanics and up to 100+ hours just to master aiming, movement, heat, weapon groups, builds, ect and keeping it all in line while in a fight.The game has a huge penalty for those who stray off in heavier mechs, which I love because it forces you to use some sort of teamwork and co-ordination.With the addition of voice chat it makes it much easier to co-ordinate flanks and other tactical plans.But I can guarantee this game is not pay to win, paying can give you a larger variety of mechs but will not make you better than anyone else.This game is NOT pay to winCons: Metas are developingClan mechs ALMOST always outgun inner spheres (But it seems to be getting work done on it)Learning the game takes a whileGame is not very popular leading to long queue times that can take 5+ minutes some times and you often times see the same people from previous games.Game is really fun, it constantly updated, and has many events and the customization is absolutely remarkable. There are also achievements that reward you with in game currency, exp, titles, and other things when completed giving you some sort of drive to go for them.I've spent around 10 dollars on the game just to get a hero mech that I was really interested in and a few cockpit items that are purely for appearance. I actually don't use that hero mech anymore because I am absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥in it but I do give it a go here and there.Definitely a game everyone should check out. Be patient when learning though, or you might find yourself getting quite frustrated.﻿Also, I noticed that almost everybody who is posting a review is a hardcore veteran. This is the first mechwarrior game I've ever played and I have to say, it's amazing. I started playing with a friend of mine who has played tons of mech warrior games and he taught me a bit about the game which lightened the extreme learning curve but now there is a very helpful tutorial that can really help new players understand movement, shooting, heat, etc.			"

												At first it's exciting and fun but quickly becomes dull and highly repetitive. I don't understand how they managed to make a mech game so boring and lifeless.Terrible UI; Too many loading, waiting and confirmation screens. Waiting 5 minutes for the server to ready, players to join, players to vote, players to ready up and then for the match to finally load for a 10 minute game isn't fun.Terrible map design, lacks any sense of scale.Limited number of maps and game modes.

												If you want the experience of piloting your favorite mechs in an accessible multiplayer enviornment then this definitely has that, sadly that's pretty much all it has.There is practically no depth to the gameplay, it's basically Robocraft. A game centred around Mech combat has so much potential for creative gameplay however PGI chose to take advantage of none of that potential. The game is basically an FPS where everyone has stacked HP, If it weren't for the buildings on urban maps you might even forget that you are in a huge mech. In summary, A solid game which will probably get boring quickly due to the lack of variety and depth in the gameplay.Worth a try but don't get suckered into the nostalgia exploitng cashgrab from PGI.

												It really lives up to the idea of a ""thinking man's FPS game"". The combat mechanics are excellent and there's nothing quite as intense coordinating with team of 12 mechs vs 12 mechs.The only downside is the game does have a bit of a grind. Its most enjoyable when you play it like an FPS. If you try to play it like an RPG and unlock everything, you will sink an endless amount of time/$$$. Overall the microtransactions don't make the game pay2win. Also, the grind becomes easier as you become better at combat and obtain optimally configured mechs.			"

												Oh Mechwarrior Online... What can I say, I've had a love hate relationship with this game for quite sometime. Playing as far back as open beta, this game never lived up to what Mechwarrior 5 could have been (at least in my opinion). However, playing on and off all these years, it slowly but surely did get a place in my heart and hopefully I can persuade you into playing this rather unique multiplayer game.Pros:-Giant, beautifully detailed, engines of destruction, Alex Iglesias has done a superbe job revitalising these old mech designs.-Exillerating combat, when you engage in a so called death circle where both pilots are moving in a circle shooting at critical points until one of you is left standing-Slow paced, now this is subjective, but to me its nice to play a slower multiplayer game when most multiplayer shooters are fast paced and twichy.-Decent maps and design-Customization has always been a strong point of Mechwarrior or any battletech game and MWO does not fail to deliver on that front-Regular content influx by the devs with tons of content on the way- Reworked old maps with time of day added-Reworked Tutorial that goes much more indepth-Two main factions with their own unique mechs that work differently-A ♥♥♥♥ton of mechs to choose from, all with unique cockpits (however, it's worth mentioning that mechs have chassis and variants i.e. the Raven mech is the chassis but it had 3 variants of it which look exactly the same but have different potential loadouts, basically, even though there are a lot of mechs, some are ""repeats"" of the same mech)-Private lobbies -Good matchmaking done by rank and also by weight type i.e. the matchmaker will alwasys try to creat matches with 3 assaults, 3 heavies, 3 mediums and 3 lights-F2P model that is pretty fair, you can't buy power, only mechs with unique skins and extra income potential.-Servers on NA, EU and OceanicCons:-Sound assets could really use some work, Autocannons, lasers, missles don't sound pleasant-Multiple gamemodes that all boil down to Deathmatch in a huge deathball formation (i.e. all mechs just cluster together and slug it out)-Community Warfare (this is the one gamemode that doesn't always degenerate into deathmatch, but even then counterattacks are essentially deathmatches, it's only attack/defend where you have to option to destroy the generators and the huge orbital gun to win instead of killing everyone) that has been in beta for eons, it has tons of promise but the development for it should have started way back in open beta imho, not 1 year into the release. As it currently stands it's alright, but nothing to write home about.-Killing a mech isn't satisfiying, no huge explosion sounds or a fireball exploding from the cockpit as the pilot ejects, just a puff of black smoke with the mech slowly falling down to the ground, ragdoll style, the explosion sounding more like a television frying out, not particularly impressive-Mech immersion isn't the greatest, you can run over trees on certain maps, but buildings, vehicles and terrain are all indestructable-The leveling up of mechs isn't really the best as it is very time consuming (ofc it's probably due to it being F2P), basically you have to buy 3 variants of the same mech(which is long in it of itself) and unlock basic skills, etlie skills and master skills for each of the 3 mech variants. However, it is worth mentioning that the skills themselves aren't game breaking, they make your mech handle better and move slightly faster than it otherwise would.-Preordering mechs is an alright way for PGI to make money, but the in-game rewards you get for prepurchase generally aren't worth the price they ask for. -Speaking of prices, the price for buying mechs with irl cash is pretty crazy going anywhere from 20-100+$ granted those 100+$ ones usually come with multiple mechs, but still, one mech costing 20$ is pretty expensive.In the end MWO is one of those games you have to try for yourself, it's F2P so there's not much to lose, and all things considered, it's a pretty good one at that.

												well what can i say ..games unbalanced as all giddy up.lets start clann mec's and heroic mecs.in low lvl games..unless your on team speak.you teams going to die probly..now dont get me wrong its a great game . i have a few hours loged on it befor i did this..even tho my game play on here is 36h.. i had over 100+h on the main sight..its rough .and at times can be fun. but untill you get a clann mec or a high cost frame..ya going to die more times then ya win.and im taling high cost mecs .. 11mil in game curency + dotn bother trying to use a long range missle set up. its useless any more no one uses TAG's ..(tag's is a item ya can equip your mec with to extend radar lock..) and even if ya get all the perks for that type of weapon. one thing ya got to know..perks cost Gxp and gxp is given at the end of a match in the amount of 10-30 ish a game .. most perks cost 500+ per rank.and go in increments of 5 per perk.and each cost gets higher per rank.so be ready for a long long long grind..even the better mec's cost 11mil to allmost 20 mil in credits.on avrage ya get 50-200k ish a match.now the game is nice and gives ya roughly 2.5 mil credits enough for a low mec..but i recomend saveing the credits till ya learn the game and under stand the way it works and what mecs can do what..and for the love of god.. lol do not think ya will roll in and rambo the players .. even in the top tir mec .. ya die just like the low ones..all a higher tir mec has is a lil more armor and maby better weapons .. speed turn and otehr stats..well i hope this helps a lil im a thumbs up this but i hope ya read what ya getting into first			"

												Been a long time fan of the Battletech / MechWarrior universe .this game hits the mark . While not a direct translation of Battletech its pretty dang Close . From the mech art to the animations , the sound of the lasers and autocannons , its a nice immerisve experience .anyone thats played the popular tank games out there , will enjoy MWO . easy to get into but challenging to master , ive only been playing a few months (before Steam launch) so i still have things im learning. you can spend hrs in the mech lab and testing grounds just doing different builds . built in VOIP makes it easier for new players to learn the ropes and communicate . With a great community of Twitch Streamers that are more than willing to help new players , Forums and other utlity sites to help see and share mech builds .If you like piloting giant robots , if you like the different popular Tank games out there , well i highly recomend playing this game .

												Let me start off by saying that I don't write reviews.MechWarrior Online, though, I am writing one for.I really, really love this game. It really allows you to cater to nearly every playstyle with a high level of customization (with the right mech chassis, of course, which will likely be your hardest choice). The game is NOT pay to win, you can only pay for cosmetic items and shortcut items so you don't have to grind so hard. However, I find buying it discouraging to buy anything in the store, because the price points are much higher than the majority of other games I've played involving in-game transactions. For example, a premium assault mech (heaviest and hardest-hitting class) Stalker Misery (top of my wishlist) is roughly $40 - for ONE mech. You don't find many people in this game who just throw that kind of money at one item just to win. Even then, it's more skill and team-based than anything, and those who do pay for primo features are often targeted and taken down first. Big thumbs up to the devs, this game is a breath of fresh air in every way. Keep doing what you're doing.			"

												Wonderful game.Fun combat, free to play, and stompy-stompy mech action.If you're unsure about it, download it and play your first 25 games (so you get your full bonus and get that sweet money.) You don't have to put money in to enjoy the game but I did because of my many, many hours in it (Pre-steam) and I don't regret it.The mechs are a little pricey if you decide to use real money, but one mech-pack worth £45 ($67.50) will take upwards of 48 hours to complete the progression for, so for the time it gives you, its not that bad.

												Mech warrior on line isn't bad for what it is, the attempt to bring a table top game to life.  there are several problems with longevity of the game.  The missons are the same there is no single player mode and no real charater development.  The Clanwar faction is one sided and not really that fun to deleve into.  So if you played the table top game in the 80's and 90's it worth playing.  If not you might want to avoid it.			"

												Played 257 hours.Ok, it is a good game no doubt.But, it is just a simple versus game.The faction play is useless people wont play it because it does not give anyhting much more than the quick play.Which is sad. Nobody plays since the update as the faction game asks too much before you can even enjoy it really.They should have added more items to get when leveling up and / or ranking up.Also that the ranking up is not really there, people should be able to notice who's a badass and who's not so they can better follow leadership.Make it also possible to put ranking up gears of items to add to your mech.And if you master three mechs from a mech type at least get some kind of benefit for it.Adding up new mechs all the time wont save the game, at the end it is the gameplay that counts.Now the gameplay is good when battling.Players want to have a base where they can walk around and see their mechs. Add uo more skills related to the mech itself there is too much of the same skills in all the mechs, have some imagination.Ok, I'll tumb it up because I love mechs but this game could have been far more, sadly they always fail to achieve that.Why not create bases that clans can build how they see it fit and create siege battles.And try to add more mechs like a 100 vs 100. It should be easily done in this technology time. Come on do some effort to make it better!			"

												Such a tragedy. A mechwarrior game should have a great singleplayer or cooperative campaign introducing the back story to all the different factions in the game, which serves as the tutorial instead of dumping your player base into the same tired old  ""training module"". All the great factions have instead been reduced to a banner and a small writeup instead of featuring exciting npc personalities to meet in game to hint as to their alignment.It's a heartbreaker that this game, with so much potential to build something exciting and great settled for the bare minimum. As a new player coming into a new game I'm looking for that reason to buy in to what you've created and nothing featured beyond a few scrim matches will probably hold my interest. It's basically like World of Tanks with Mechs. So if you are entertained for hours with world of tanks this is your next level game. For those who like a more enriched gaming experience, I would suggest a pass on this one. "

												I'm not going to discuss the entire lengthy history of Mechwarrior Online it's highs and lows it's troubles and the lot. If you want that I'm sure there is a review that will or a google search. I am going to talk about the game as it is today, the 25th of December 2015. This is a solid title faithful to Battletech/Mechwarrior franchise. There is a learning curve, some may find it steep but the first time you take down an enemy battlemech is a wonderful feeling and well worth the effort involved to get good at the game. Mech balance is overall fairly good with 30 ton light mechs able to compete against 100 ton Assaults. Weapons are actually pretty balanced and while balance is ongoing for such things the majority of mechs in the game are viable and actively used. The F2P model is expensive but not required to have an acceptable fun time. It does speed things along but no more so then any other game title offering a ""premium time"" earnings. You are however limited to 4 mechbays, while more can be earned with frequent events and Community Warfare you may eventually find yourself doing the math and paying 1.50$ for a mechbay. My biggest complaint would be Community Warfare not being in an acceptable state. The game mode is supposed to be the idea of factions facing off for galactic conquest but the way the matches play out doesn't capture that feeling at all at the moment.Mostly you'll be hitting quick join and playing in one of the three game modes with several maps. It's fun and enjoyable if you like a sim like game vs other players. In the end I'd suggest you try it if you have any interest at all in giant robots. It's free, the new player experience is pretty good and you can rapidly find yourself having fun if you are at all a fan of vertical tanks.			"

The more fire power u unleash, the more heating problem u create, that's why there is available Air condition in ur mech, or in this game is called Heat Sinks.SO overall is , this game is good, the more good thing is, this game is FREE, that's the matter the most :Pif u like robot, but u don't have fast finger, and don't like full concentration, can customized ur mechThis game is the right choiceAs a person who have played MechWarrior 1, 2, 3, 4 and online for around 1 years :P "

												This game has two sides.The mechlaband the battlingThe mechlab is an ingenius design that will make you think about the different weaponery and devices placed on the mech. Will it overheat quickly, will it move fast enough, does it have the firepower to cause a dent in the enemies armour. Also your choice of mechs is vital, as there may not be enough ""tonnage"", to be able to completely kit up the mech. This alone, is part of the challenge that this game has to offer.Then the combat. This video should sum it up 


YouTube™ Video: War always changes - Mech Warrior Online 

			Views: 29		

			Contradicting what fallout 4 said. This took very long to edit. mainly because of syncing the music to the mech. Feedback is wanted on every video. Post it in the comments		

The combat does have some remarkably good mechanics in play. For  example, turning the mech off makes you invisible to radar(and i think thermal imagining). Great for hiding in a corner, then shooting the enemy in the back.my only issue, is that the game offers a locational damage engine, but still feels like the mechs have a base health system. This may be because there isn't alot of critical points, or that the armour negates the locational damage, but it just doesn't feel as impressive as war thunders damage engine.also, the game is very generous to new players, giving  currency boosts in the space of 12 hours of game play to get a decent mech in the game(or weaponary,etc).But overall, a well made game. Play it, see what you think. don't like it? uninstall it.:)			"

												So, I'll say this: I've been playing MWO since closed beta, and I've played Mechwarrior since I was 3. I'm somewhat of a fanboy of the series, and still play MW4 and MW3 regularly.MWO is not those games. MWO has a completely different atmoshpere. The 'mechs feel lighter, they're not the slow to respond, big, heavy feeling behemoths they were before. They're not the up close brawlers that are hard to even aim with that they were in 4, and they're not the insane boat builds you'd get in 3.MWO is not a classic Mechwarrior game. It doesn't have the campaign, the scale, the intensity, or the character. Mechwarrior 4 is a prime example with people like Duncan Fisher, Bird Dog, Aisha Thastus, and all the Lancemates you'd see.MWO is a jump in, jump out, queue based first person shooter with robots. It is not a simulator, it doesn't feel as heavy as the old games, and, yes, Living Legends feels more like a Mechwarrior game if we're talking purely about controls and mobility. I personally love the fact that 4 has weird aiming controls, and that you really have to have timing and positioning to hit something, it just immerses you more that way.And that's where I come to my main point: Mechwarrior Online is a fun as absolute heck game. I've spent many hours playing my Locust LCT-1E and Wolverine WVR-6K. I haven't even played 80% of the 'mechs in the game. I could have built up a Dire Wolf or two, along with several Mediums and Lights by this point, but I've had too much fun just piloting a Locust and wiping the floor with 'mechs several times my size.And, yes, you can do that. People will tell you that light 'mechs are useless, and that Assaults being more expensive is just a way to make you buy MC so you can get actual good 'mechs faster.Those people, however, are absolute morons. I've carried many games in my Locust, many of which I would have lost in a bigger, slower 'mech. I've torn apart entire lances of assault 'mechs, dealt more damage than half of my team combined, and won matches more or less single handedly.And I'm bad at this game compared to a lot of people I knowMWO is very much a game where the team as a whole matters massively, but one 'mech can easily be the difference between winning and losing.""It's always helpful to have teammates; it gives the enemy something else to shoot at.""That is Mechwarrior Online's teamplay in a nutshell. Stay near your teammates (Without blocking them or shooting them in the back, please.), and focus on dealing as much damage and killing as many enemies as possible while staying alive.You may carry the team alone in a light 'mech, but you still need them there to absorb damage and keep the enemy team's attention. No 'mech, no matter the weight and class, will be able to survive an entire enemy team. Even if that entire team is stock Urbanmechs.So, my verdict of MWO? If you liked the old 'mechwarrior games, at least give it a shot. If you haven't tried one before, this is the easiest one to get into, and will at least give you an impression of the universe. Joining a unit is a really effective way to learn about the game and the lore, and having friends makes everything more fun.I reccomend this game wholeheartedly, personally- but it's certainly not for everyone.Also, no, the Trial 'Mechs aren't bad, you just suck. No, you shouldn't use a joystick, they suck. No, Clans are not overpowered. No, you will not carry the team alone. No, you may not be on my team, shoot me in the back, and expect to be alive for more than 3 seconds afterwards.That is all.			"

												I love this game. My advice to you is ignore all of the bad reviews and play it for yourself, it is free after all. If you don't like it, don't play it. This game involves a lot of strategy and takes a while to master. After about 100 matches I became a pretty solid player so give it some time.			"

												The most ballanced Mechwarrior/Battletech game yet, lacking the insane legging issues of Mechwarrior 3 (where losing one leg would take you out of the match) and the poptarting meta-game of Mechwarrior 4 (hiding behind a hill then jumping up for fire and letting the hill protect you as your weapons reloaded)The ever changing nature of an MMO, and Free-to-play games in general however, does mean that today's best mechs, can be tomorrow's garbage - and then back again.Case in point, since open beta, I have watched the Hunchback chassis travel from ""Best medium chassis in the game, and nothing can change that"" to ""worthless garbage, and nothing can change that"" and back at least twice.Now for a comparison of sorts...As far as most free-to-play issues (IE, is it REALLY free?)Absolutely no money needs to be spent to do well, or to do ANYTHING in the game.What mechs there are that cost real-world money to buy, can be bought with patience and timing.MC (The real-world-money equivalent) is given for playing the Faction Warfare mode (also known as Community Warfare) as are Mechbays - arguably the one thing you would need to actually buy.In the end, knowing your mech, and how to play, is far more important than anything else.

												My hours are low in Steam, but I have played this game a fair amount from the main client it self downlaoding it from their main website.This game will teach you patience, and that is not a bad thing. You will learn to lean on your team mates for the weaknesses you have. May it be speed, ECM, AMS, or lacking fire power. You will get more out of this game if you play with a small team so you can coordinate with them.Some people say this game is pay to win, I personally think it's kind of true, but it isn't bad compared to other games. Theres only so much you can pay for in this game, you just have to counter their weapon setup. If you play this game a fair amount you'll know what kind of weapons a mech is packing just looking at them. Think first, map awareness, position, and fire.You can enjoy this game solo, but team voice chat, socializing, planning, having the leader mark the map, is where this game shines.			"

												Mechwarrior Online has made great strides since splitting from its original publisher (IGP). If you can get past its expensive pricing structure, the core gameplay is enjoyable and often times exhilerating. Unlike many Free to Play games, MWO does not fall prey to pay to win. Instead their mech packs give early access to new mech chasis.I would recommend this title to anyone who enjoys piloting stompy robots, shooting lasers, and working as a team. This is not an FPS, and going rambo won't get you very far. While there is a steep learning curve, the new tutorial system and helpful community are great assets.			"

												Although I'd say that it leans a little more towards the action game side of things than the classic MechWarrior sims, I think it still captures the feeling of being a mech pilot pretty well. I was apprehensive due to admittedly being a bit of a sim snob when it comes to this sort of game, but I'm finding it to be a lot of fun. Sure, they made a few changes from the board game, but even as a fan, I can deal with them. I think it still does a pretty good job of giving each type of mech a job, and not turning it into a simple shooter. You can take a missile boat and provide long-range support from cover, or a fast & light recon machine with electronic warfare equipment, or brawler, etc., and I think they did a pretty good job of making each one feel like what it is.Regarding the ""freemium"" thing, the one thing that kind of annoys me is that you have to use MC (the currency you have to pay for, as opposed to C-Bills, which you can earn by playing) to pay for changing the colors on your mech, and it's not exactly cheap. That's pretty minor though, and so far I'm having plenty of fun with the mechs I've purchased using the C-Bills I got from matches (there are ""special"" ones you can't buy with CB). They give you a bonus amount of CB for each of your first 25 matches, so even if you suck as bad as I did, you can afford to get something cool by the end of that.Overall, it's better than I expected, and while it's not perfect, it is a lot of fun.

												I've been playing this game for a long time, and though I do like the game, it isn't without flaws. In general, matches can range from awesome to a complete waste of time. Faction warfare is meant to be the defining mode of the game, but it's just not very good. Every map revolves around choke points which leads to no tactics and every match feels the same. Hardpoint bloating, weapon boating, and the insanely high pinpoint damage this causes are my main issues. Players will put no thought into builds and just slap on as many of one type of weapon as they can, and since many mechs have a ridiculous amount of hardpoints, they're able to put out so much damage, time to kill becomes non existant.Despite these problems I have, I still can't get myself to leave this game. In my opinion, those fantastic matches, though increasingly rare these days, make the game still worth playing. It is free to play, so if you're into mechs I still think this game is worth a try.

												I really like the game and enjoy playing it.  That being said this game has a steep learning curve.   1. Balancing a mech and playing as an organized unit are hard, especially organizing in PUG matches.  While your mech build is important, the team play and communication are most important.  2. Most mechs are playable and can do well; you just have to find the right heat/firepower/range ratio for that mech model and build. There are usually several and they can be personalized.  3. Pay to Win?  The new mech releases are only available to purchase with real money, but most of the models become available in a few months for in game money.  There are a few obsolete models from the game launch, and a few small bonues on the newer released mechs.  4. Overall, this does not matter much.  I.E. The mech and model that I do best with has been there since launch, cost in game money, and has been nerfed a few times.  Your skill is what matters.5.  Spending real money, allows you access to the newer mechs, special mechs (The real difference is a paint job), cockpit items, and customizable paint jobs.  6. Grind:  The game has lots of bonus challanges, going on almost every day, that allow you to win in game money, in game cash credits, mechs, and cockpit items.  You can always use trial mechs from the start to earn these bonuses.  7.  Mech and skill advancement; Buy a medium or heavy mech to start with.  They are the most versatile and do well when together.  Save your in game money and buy 2 variants of your first mech so you can master that mech.  You should earn close to enough in game currency to buy the next model once you have skilled up the basic tier of a medium or heavy mech.  8.  Talk; It is a team combat simulation.  The keys are to focus fire, stay together, and communicate.			"

												Hands down this is the best free-to-play game out there.  It grants no advantage to those who pay, just greater variety.  I've played penniless for about 70 hours and had a blast!  Any old Mechwarrior fan would be most proud of this build, and any tank-game player would be an easy convert.  Very dedicated community, religious updates from devs, and great art direction.  I can't say enough about how well-made this game is, top to bottom.			"

												Highly recommended. Great blend of action and tactics. And you can't go wrong with the price tag of free. Well worth giving it a try. It's very deep, and might seem daunting at first, however, the tutorials teach you the basics. There are also plenty of other resources at the official site and on Youtube.			"

												This game is an awesome online team game, that allows you to purchase mechs that can be fully customizable.  Pick your favorite mech type and then build it the way you want, with the weapons you want.  The maps allow for all types of play styles and the game types keep everything interesting.  You can build a fast, close-range attacker or go heavy long-range assault.  If you like piloting your own robotic warmachine and coordinating with friends, then this is definitely the game for you.

												I really like the game and enjoy playing it.  That being said this game has a steep learning curve.   1. Balancing a mech and playing as an organized unit are hard, especially organizing in PUG matches.  While your mech build is important, the team play and communication are most important.  2. Most mechs are playable and can do well; you just have to find the right heat/firepower/range ratio for that mech model and build. There are usually several and they can be personalized.  3. Pay to Win?  The new mech releases are only available to purchase with real money, but most of the models become available in a few months for in game money.  There are a few obsolete models from the game launch, and a few small bonues on the newer released mechs.  4. Overall, this does not matter much.  I.E. The mech and model that I do best with has been there since launch, cost in game money, and has been nerfed a few times.  Your skill is what matters.5.  Spending real money, allows you access to the newer mechs, special mechs (The real difference is a paint job), cockpit items, and customizable paint jobs.  6. Grind:  The game has lots of bonus challanges, going on almost every day, that allow you to win in game money, in game cash credits, mechs, and cockpit items.  You can always use trial mechs from the start to earn these bonuses.  7.  Mech and skill advancement; Buy a medium or heavy mech to start with.  They are the most versatile and do well when together.  Save your in game money and buy 2 variants of your first mech so you can master that mech.  You should earn close to enough in game currency to buy the next model once you have skilled up the basic tier of a medium or heavy mech.  8.  Talk; It is a team combat simulation.

												Best played as a Company on Company Mechwarrior game, there is no campaign, there is no versus AI, and those are no things that you should be expecting coming into the game.  It is all about dropping into a couple games and blowing giant stompy robots up and then moving on, and there is nothing wrong with that.			"

												I really love BattleTech so I am biased but I love MWO as well. It really feels like you are piloting a 60 ton machine. The action is slow, tactical and unforgiving. Really, if you ever playing MechWarrior, there is no reason to try this. It's free!			"
