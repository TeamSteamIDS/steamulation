Early Access Review
								Unplayable... Simply unplayable...This game looks good and I like the premise but the control scheme makes this game simply unplayable. I have been playing flight games for years, and I have never seen a game with a control scheme that makes so little sense. If you want to make the default somehthing so bizzar that's fine, but you have to give serious users the option to create custom control mapping. This game is not worth retraining my brain to a new control scheme that is completely differnt than anything else out there. The art looks good and I the controls are responsive but unusable to me. I would not recoment this game to anyone until the controls are revised or users are allowed to create custom mapping.			"

								I've played a few flight sims with my Vive and overall they are a very good experience. Final Strike is no exception, it has great graphics, fast gameplay and a lot of action. Compared to some of the other flight sims, like DCS, it is more arcade style, but no really a problem for me becuase the focus here is clearly on fighting, explosions, and taking down aliens. Speaking of which, I think that the fact that you fight against an alien mothership a great addition, and I surprised that no other game has tried something like it before. You area really up to your neck in alien ships, and trying to take down the mothership while they are coming at you is pretty challenging. You have an assortment of weapons on your ship (even though unlimited ammo) but the balance feels good and even after an hour I haven't finished the first level yet. A nice overall experience, and one that I expect to be coming back to regularly when I need a quick air combat fix in VR.			"

Early Access Review
								This is just barely reccomended for now as I don't think the game is good enough to warrant a purchase yet, but given a few more additions and fixes it might just be a fun little game. Props to the devs for hot fixing the issue with the seated position on the Oculus Rift within a few hours of release and user feedback.So for the mini review of this Early Access game:Pros- Great concept- Lots of potential for fast and furious dog fights- If you enjoyed the ending of Independence Day this probably is for you- Very fluid and fast gameplay with good framerates- Priced right for this type of game unlike so many other VR games out nowCons:- For some reason my guns and missiles auto fire - the dev stated they used the xbox 360 gamepads for development, and I'm using the xbone gamepad so that might be the issue - should be fixed as xbone pad comes standard with the Rift- The scale of the cockpit and pilot model is off - I would say it is about 150 % of what it should be- Extremely unrealistic flight model - yes, it is an action game but you go just as fast up down and to the sides there is no drag or gravity. It shouldn't be DCS World style, but a little bit more realism would make for more tactical gameplay and hopefully make it more interesting- Some geometry glitch on the ground needs to be fixed, seems a solid is poking through the textures - nothing major it just is very noticeable- The ground textures could possibly be made a little bit higher resolution on the highest gfx settings as they look very bland now- A little more developed targeting system would be welcome - leading reticule for guns and a more solid lock on mechanism with tone for missiles maybe- The enemy AI could be a bit more after the player - they have a tendency to leave me all alone at the start at leastAt this price you can probably afford getting it even though it needs work - given some more development it could be an ok title for smaller play sessions.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Watcher Public Service Announcement Update Version: #1Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer.Generally I would write a full review, but with the amount of problems in regards to controls, I found it difficult to justify it. I tested the game using the HTC VIVE and Keyboard + Mouse to very negative results. The key issue involves the main window being unable to catch the mouse cursor before it leaves the border of the screen. If this happens, you cannot register the mouse clicks. I ended up, after several failed attempts, resting the Vive on my forehead and looking at the display window on the monitor to at least attempt a few more playthroughs. This allowed me to see where the cursor was, but it does not help the initial problem. Graphics are presentable, audio is extremely loud on default (and stuck on default), settings for volume and display options do not work, and motion sickness is a possibility. The content for this game is bare minimal with a couple of environments. The main objective revolves around destroying the alien mothership and that is pretty much the gist. I cannot recommend this game purely on the circumstances I played it, which is a Vive owner using a mouse and keyboard. You might have better luck with a controller or the Rift, but if you fall under the other two categories I highly recommend skipping until these issues are fixed. I know this is Early Access, but if a game is barely playable with a listed component, it still needs work. I wish the developers all the best and hope to review this again six months down the line. This has been a EAW PSA. Included is a short video of my play through using the display window on the monitor.

								not recommended at the present time, no button to reset your tracked seated position, so you have to run steam vr room set up and hope for the best, on menu i was sat behind my avatar and in game to the left of the pilot, controls were horrible could not swap sticks for roll, the cockpit canopy looked like it had not been cleaned for months and my machine guns fired constantly without me pressing anything.  with patches to correct the above faults this could have potential.

								I know it's early access but the physics suck! It's great they've implemented VR support but it's honestly not worth paying for right now. Hopefully they can work on improving the flight physics, because right now it's possible to just rotate on the spot if you hold the stick full left or right.			"

								This game is rough! It needs a lot of work before it is playable on VIVE. The controls have lots of issues. The sound quality is quite poor. The graphics are simplistic. The gameplay is more reminiscent of a tech demo. It feels like a game meant for GearVR, at best. Getting refund.			"

								I can't reccommend this game in this state.  Graphically its behind the times, by a long shot.  The more pressing matter, however, are the completely wonky controls, and the complete inability to map buttons.  NO ONE flies a plane with 2 joysticks, one for roll, one for pitch.  It goes against EVERY SINGLE flight sim out there, and right now its next to impossible to change this.  Wait until someone decides to fix this before purchasing.			"

								I have tried to play this game with a USB joystick and just with the keyboard. I have given up.I didn't expect much for the price and when it runs the game looks nice enough. The only working controls however, even if I try every key on the keyboard, are roll left or right and fire. Otherwise the game is totally uncontrollable and there is no way in the options to adjust key bindings or setup a multi-axis joystick.Requested a refund. This product shouldn't be for sale, even as early access.			"

								STAY AWAY HTC VIVE OWNERS TYPICAL OCULUS MOTION SICKNESS 10/10 AFTER 2 MINS. well i think the idea is awsome but the controls with the xbox controller isn't to clever i must say, this game is an oculus game so you will feel very very sick within 2 mins for you vive people. i can walk around playing room scale vive games alday but this really does turn your stomach. i found that i had to sit down in the middle of the room for me to be in the plane so could do with a button to move it to were you are in the room not just 1 fixed place. refund time but il let my friends have ago first make them sick and show them why not to own a oculus. sound effects are good tho thats the + guys!

Early Access Review
								This is the first VR flight simulator that I have tired using my Rift, and now it's really all I'm interested in playing on it. I have sometimes gotten motion sick with some of the VR games, but for this one some reason I don't. I think it may be because that the entire time that you're in the game, you have a body under you, and also you are in a cockpit in the jet that makes it feel very real. The graphics are some of the better that I have seen in any VR game to date, in particular, the horizon and the detail of the ground seems to go on forever. You really have complete freedom as far as where you can fly and how close you can get to different objects in the environment, including the other ships. I've found several easter eggs in the game already, I'm looking for more, but without ruining the secrets, there seem to be many things that you can do to attack the mothership in the game. This is in early access so hopefully they will add some more levels and different locations, becuase I think that there is a ton of potential and I could easily play this one for many more hours.

								Seated thing was a bit of a bummer, but hotfix already implemented, just need some working controls (mine do not 100% match stated controls and I have no way to fix it)Other than that, with updates this could be easily a nice pick-up-and-go schmup fighter that is, even in its infancy, quite fun to play in VR. I truly hope this can be added to over time to make it a really in-depth arcade shooter and add refinements. If this can reach the heights of ace combat back in the day I would die happy.Recommending for now as it is pretty fun and devs appear to be monitoring forum for bug reports with quick turn around.

								 i have a very high tolerance for vr. but this game made me sick and sweating. not sure if its the fps or what but it was horrible. the videos make this game look like intense dogfights but it was acutally quite boring. my 11yr old even couldnt stand it. the concept is cool. i enjoy some seated expeirences. not all vr has to be room scale. maybe down the road the dev will get this game looking better and playing better. maybe tweak the controls a bit. the thumb stick that rolls felt like it was on the wong control stick. was very discomforting.

Early Access Review
								I got this game before the independence day 2 movie came out and I'm so pumped I got it. This is excactly like the last scene of the movie, you're literally surrounded by alien ships. Whe you see the other fighters engage them next to you it feels like you're in the movie. I was in one dogfight and a ship exploded next to me I literally lost it, I swear that I could feel the explosion it was so close. The feeling of eveything is so real, like when I nosedive in the ship, I can feel it in my stomach, the drop is so real. I honestly could just play this for the feeling of being in a real jet fighter, the fact that I can enter into a aerial dogfight with aliens makes it all the better. The setup for this game was flawless, I just loaded it up on my Oculus Rift and it put me in the game immediately. I started in a lobby and was able to choose eveything with my controller no keyboard needed. Not sure what they should add to this game, maybe multiplayer if there was enough players to fight against.			"

Early Access Review
								FUN! - HARD even on EASY -  Going to be good - but not much of a game yet. CENTER view doesn't work.  I never was in line with my hud recticule. Could not reconfigure controls. (xbox)  amazingly smooth at this point.  Easy to fly.  HARD to not get killed.  when I died, I never knew why or what got me. I lived longest by coming in high or low and circling the mother ship a few times.  shooting missles rather blindly - because the canon - couldn't be aimed.  (I was to high).   Somehow my body and plane seemed  TO BIG.  (as if made for the Rift) and not sized for my VIVE.  The screen shots show a smaller cockpit. STILL for the price - I want to support their effort.  Let them make some money to entice them to keep working on it.  It's is pretty cool - dispite not being able to live for more than a minute or two.  The ground work for a game here is and looks great... Now it needs a game.  One life? (make it so maybe we get damaged and pretty a button to put out a fire and continue or some such to get 3 lives?    I alpha/beta test VR games like CDF starfighter... if you need help testing let me know.  I also tested Mervels. (VR game).    I say for under 10 bucks - get it to support their efforts.			"

Making this into a walking/flight simulator and getting shot at!!!!!) or not working at all.3.Lack of developer's (or devoloper) responce to forums.4. Game may be taken down due to copyright.5.Possible Cash Grab Only.You have been Warned.I personally hope this changes.If it does in a few months, I may rebuy it.But so far I'm scared I wasted my cash on a fail product.

								Absolutely not the game you're looking for. The controls are extremely counter-intuitive. It's as if the developers have no understanding of how flight happens and what the controls do.Case in point: The rudders turn the aircraft like a steering wheel turns a car. That's no, just no.If this is a work in progress, it should be marked that way. In fact, I wouldn't even call this an Alpha build. This was a rush to be first and it simply doesn't work.			"

								The ONLY reason I don't like this game, is that it limits me to using my left joystick on my xbox controller to ""control"" the plane (don't know aeronautical terms).  I can't play the game like that.  I have to be able to control it with my right thumb.  If I was able to customize the controls I'd probably give this game a thumbs up and a great review, but as is, I can't play it...			"
