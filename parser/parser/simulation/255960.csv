												FREE SOUNDTRACK!!!!I had a great time doing sound design and writing the music/score for this game and while it's been available on my website at xorcist.com for a while, it's now INCLUDED WITH THE DOWNLOAD OF THIS GAME! Some of you in the scene may even remember dancing to ""Bad Mojo"" on the dance floor throughout the gothic and industrial scene.The soundtrack is a double disc set and comes in FLAC as well as MP3 formats along with ALL ARTWORK for the disc, tray cards, etc. - It's hidden away in your game directory at <drive>:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/BadMojo/Bonus Content/Soundtrack (FLAC) and Soundtrack(MP3)I hope you enjoy this little bonus and while I don't see anything from any sales of this game, the hopes is you check out my site and maybe check out my other music and soundtrack work.Comments welcomed!Bat / Xorcist			"

												I bought this Kafkaesque game back in 1996 and played and enjoyed it quite a bit it quite a bit even after finishing it the first time:  In this a game, you play as the protaganist after having turned into an American cockroach (after an attempt at black magic based on greed gone bad) roaming around the seedy apartment building presumably trying to figure out how to turn back, though the game doesn't explicitly make clear quite what is going on.  The extent of your abilities as the roach are to move up, down, left, and right, and interact with things by pushing them or using your weight or presence.  The short term goals the roach needs to achieve (puzzles) are cryptically given in the form of poetic (rhyming) riddles that are often subtlely humorous; the puzzles themselves are quite challenging, possibly to the point of being frustrating for some players depending on their tolerence for or enjoyment of adventure game puzzles.The developers and creaters of the game did a very good job in realizing a very dark and ominous game in tone, atmosphere, and mood.  The music is also very good and fits perfectly.  The Steam release also includes some extra content:  the soundtrack (two compact discs worth) in mp3 and FLAC format, some videos with developer commentary, concept art, storyboards and more.			"

												This game is as great as it seems, with flaws as evident as it seems.You'll have a great experience, exploring a world through the eyes of a cockroach. The scenary is detailed and very realistic on the objects and interactions you'll find, even though graphics are clearly limited. It's old technology, but it is so well done it feels right. The history is a good and interesting complement to the theme.On the negative side, controls and game feedback are bad. Sometimes you know you have to interact with something, but can't seem to get it done, and sometimes you'll find yourself with no clues to resolve a puzzle.I recommend playing this game with a walkthrough, for times you get stuck. To me, it did not ruin an excelent game experience, and made me focus on the many good points in this game.It's a short game (I would guess most people would take around 3-5 hours to finish it) and even though is limited on playability, it makes you feel like you're really living a history. In the experience aspect, it is a far better game than many modern ones.			"

												Bad Mojo needed a rerelease on something other than GOG, and it got it. Bad Mojo is a nasty, gritty adventure game about a man turned cockroach. It's a major displeasure to look at, and fittingly so. The game's pretty cryptic at first, being thrown into a sewer with no instructions, but if you continue exploring around, where you're supposed to be going will be guided pretty much. $5.99 isn't bad, as you get bonus material such as concept art. and the making-of documentaries along with commentary over the cutscenes, so, overall, if you're not squeemish, get Bad Mojo.

												A weird, partly nauseating, yet strangely good adventure game from the golden 90s. A small blast from the past.After being transformed into a cockroach, it's up to the player to find out more about his mysterious past and to solve puzzles in a ridden-down tavern in San Francisco. From the bird's eye perspective you control the cockroach with your arrow keys i.e. with WASD and basically let it crawl around in bathrooms, kitchens and other rooms to find out how to transform yourself back into your human form. During your bizarre journey other insects and animals are happy to help you or to eat you - watch out for Franz, the cat.The story is mainly being told by several live-action cutscenes, pouring the charm and the feeling of 90's FMV games. While some younger gamers nowadays may disagree with me, I find that such cutscenes with real actors should find their way to modern gaming again. It gives a story a much more deeper note, even though acting back then wasn't always top-notch. Remember the good old C&C cutscenes by the way?Anyway, the game is quite short though (circa 4 hours) and has its flaws as well. Sometimes there are some bugs (hehe, bugs...) when the savestate is being loaded and your roach suddenly finds itself trapped in a wet spot. Just load again the same game if this happens. Furthermore the pre-rendered 2D graphics with the relatively small interactive sections aren't everybody's taste, but I found them appealing for a mid-90's adventure game.The Good:+ A fair amount of live-action cutscenes+ Good and innovative story+ Interesting interaction with small-scale environment+ A dark, grimly atmosphereThe Bad:- Relatively short- Outdated (but charming) graphics- Some minor bugs (not the ants, maggots, roaches...)The Ugly:-- Some nasty scenes in the game. I liked them though.Give Bad Mojo a try if it's on sale, it keeps you entertained for a whole evening. With its numerous cutscenes it sometimes appears like a interactive movie rather than a video game. Nonetheless pretty recommended.7/10 "

""And when I looked into that necklace, that strange locket that was supposed to be my mother's. A weird feeling, like a twisted spell. Bad Mojo.""- Roger Samms, pre-cockroachBad Mojo Redux: a cinematic platformer, without the platforming.There's a timeless, agreed on standard way to play 90s puzzle games. The point n clicks. The graphic adventures. You play for a bit, explore as best you can, get frustrated, look up a walkthrough and then recommend it to other people anyway because you liked the dialogue. It's the unwritten code, a valiant tradition since the first King's Quest even as everyone told them to stop.Continuously. Over and over. They never listened.This isn't the way to play Bad Mojo. Exploring is the puzzle. 90% of the time, anyway, there's two puzzles that come to mind involving dials and alcohol that qualify as actual puzzles, but generally speaking if you've interacted with everything you can and looked about, you've won the level. Congrats. Good work. Onto the next one if you can find it. Biggest challenge is knowing where to go next. It's not an insubstantial one, either; the game proudly advertises its 800 high-resolution screens to scuttle through, and my friends that means 800 high-resolution screens to get lost in. All of which look great with the Redux boost to Truecolour from the original game's 256.By some miracle, Bad Mojo worked on a Windows 10 laptop without any real issues. Some FMVs had their blank sides cut off to reveal the game below, and it ran at a fairly low resolution by modern standards - but the game is FMVs and pre-rendered backgrounds anyway. You can run it at any resolution you want, it's not going to look any better. It's a shame, then, with the premise being exploring these 800 high-resolution screens, that the act of exploring them is so jank. They gave you tank controls. This is fine. They gave you tank controls that consistently spaz out when placed in a situation other than a flat, wide surface. This is not fine. This is annoying.Roger Samms will struggle to coexist with edges, will struggle to convey which avenues are actually walkable and which have invisible walls, will pull on his cockroach climbing shoes and slow to a crawl while his sprite reaches for the sky (at will), and unless you've lined up straight on and have made at least a few ritual sacrifices to the God of Hitboxes, pushing objects will not work out in your favour. Only fitting that a game about karmic cockroaches be so noticeably bugged. Maybe it's karma. Or just the baddest mojo of all.""My brain reeled. My knees buckled. And then there was black. The warm and somewhat comforting feel of darkness. The long and perilous detour into the night of my soul.""- Roger Samms, still not quite a cockroachSo, like most cinematic platformers (without the platforming), Bad Mojo is driven by art, music, and dialogue.All of which are great. The game takes way too much pleasure in depicting the absolute grotesque nature of what must qualify as the seediest motel on Earth - from writhing maggots, rotting mice and all-too-alive cockroaches scuttling around bathrooms, bedrooms and unkempt kitchens. It's a sight to see. Pleasant in how unpleasant it is, with all the detail you never wanted.The music is a quirky industrial beat, fitting for a quirky industrial game, and seeing as it's what you spend most of the game listening to the beat doesn't skip a beat. It's nice. Soundtrack itself is even buried in the files somewhere. But the dialogue is on another level. An absolute joy to behold. Some FMV games played it straight (not many). Some chewed the scenery. Some might even be a little hammy. Bad Mojo skips the scenery, skips the ham, and targeted both with a tactical nuke. There were no survivors, not by the time the actors were done with their lines.The performances are incredible, memorable and they more than carry a story that honestly wasn't that bad to begin with - one that fails to really blow expectations out of the water.Mostly told through readable material in the background, and inter-levels meetings with the ""Oracle"", Bad Mojo's story is about disgruntled employee Roger Samms and his landlord Eddie Batito, and that they're related. That's the twist, they hang it over your head the whole game like you didn't figure it out halfway through the first level. That twist just becomes frustrating, even disappointing. A game about an insane metamorphosis set to an industrial soundtrack, where you regularly have meetings with other insects who gibber in inane riddles, and aside from some lategame eye-focused imagery it just gets reduced to a family spat.They bring it back with more radiation-singed ham but boy can you just feel the palpable air of missed opportunities.""I felt kind of bad about blowing up Eddie's bar, so I brought him with me to Mexico.""- Roger Samms, post-cockroach but arguably still oneUltimately, Bad Mojo is an art and music driven game. Those are good, maybe even some of the best for the era. Definitely up to snuff considering the volume of games released since. If you're up for some incredible acting, some decent writing, and a visual/audio treat, then give yourself that treat with some Bad Mojo.			"

												Hidden gem for every adult gamer! Even if you are not a big fan of adventure games, I strongly recommend it. It's hardcore and very atmospheric. Feels like if Kafka made this game(not only because of the transformation part). And one more thank you to the developers for including such bibs and bobs as ""making of"" video and especially the soundtrack. I had first played it when I was around 13 and this was one of THE games that defined my future tastes in gaming and even movies.			"

												It's probably a great game. It certainly looks like it. Unfortunately, it doesn't run. Have a look at the discussion forums for this game and you'll see several threads of people trying to find a way to stop the game from crashing on load, and not succeeding. Nightdive and Steam have both refused to offer any support or assistance with this problem. It crashes intantly on loading: the only way I was able to get the 5 minutes of gameplay required to post a review was to leave the crash error window open for a while. If you're prepared to gamble with the possibility of the game not working, go ahead and give it a try. You may get lucky. But until some kind of patch is released to fix this common issue (and that doesn't seem likely to happen), I have to recommend saving your money for something that works.			"

												Owned this along time ago, took a risk in a local charity shop.It turned out to be one of the most influencial games ive played. Its premise is so unique plus its just so imaginative with how it handles the world around you. Im so glad this games seems to be getting something of a second wind here and on GOG, it was sorely overlooked (although highly regarded)  in its day. Your basicly a cocoroach in a couple of rooms. but these rooms are HUGE and so interesting. If you loved the premise of films such as Honey i shrunk the kids and bat ♥♥♥♥ crazy stuff such as Pye, get this and look incredibly cool playing it day after day ;)  Completely surreal !! Graphics - sort of grainy/gritty  digitized  mix with some nice art. Realy well set up scenes and stylized FMV.Sound - standout, spooky and weird synth stuff up to the usual cult b-movie quality of that era.Gameplay, lots of exploring and solving puzzles (with minimal , easy to get to grips with controls ), some not so hard and some that have taken me months! (Just like the old days) . Some unfair trial and error but, its from the era of the quick save, pretty brutal.We need more games like this !			"

												Now, the game has some of these typical adventure game issues where the solutions makes you go ""how the f*ck was i supposed to figure that out?!"" But assuming you have a walkthrough in hand for when you get stuck, it's a really unique experience. A surreal feverdream of a game with a gritty horror atmosphere coupled with cheesy but charming FMVs. I would definitly recommend it if you are into adventure games. Especially if you like your games old, weird and obscure.Be wary though, some people are apparently unable to run the game. But for me it worked just fine.			"

												In short: It is a simple, almost casual puzzle/story based video game from the 90s, with real grandiloquent acting captioned, extremely easy gameplay (four arrow keys), and loosely inspired by Kafka, that is a gloomy, raw and modern take on human psychology... and cockroaches.In very short: This game is a masterpiece. Buy it. Now.Alright so to make it a bit longer, I would say that except for three reasons (too young - not incline to try oldies - not very open minded in general), there is NO reason whatsoever you could not enjoy this work of art. There is everything in it: visuals, sounds, musics, drawings, acting, lightning, writing, poetry, catharsis... The game is very short, although it took me months when I was a teenager at the time, but don't expect to spend more than ten hours to figure it out. You can finish the game in thirty minutes, probably, but finding all there is to read, watch and learn, all left from the honest and hard working developers to the audience, would take you these ten hours.The story is fantastic, the acting is brilliant, the world conception is marvelous, the psychology behind all the story is genius. Plus it works without any tweak on modern computers, AND you get a nice making of bonus with cool devs talking.In other words, and for real gamers: remember Sanitarium? This game is not a point and click, but it will give you the same impact. That's right, the impact of the word: masterpiece.DO RECOMMEND!			"

												This is such a disappointing rip-off of a game.  I remember playing the original game on release, and it was amazing.  The product description states that the game is ""rendered in stunning hi-resolution detail"", but that quip must be a relic from the original release.  And I'm not sure what ""updated FMV"" refers to, because everything I've seen in this version of the game is rendered in grainy 640x480 8-bit video.  It's dishonest to market this as an updated version of the twenty year-old game when the only update has been to hack it together to operate on modern operating systems.  It doesn't even scale the graphics to modern dimensions - it just forces your desktop resolution to 640x480 (which is guaranteed to look beyond foul on a modern high-res wide-screen LCD display).  Alt-tabbing out to adjust the volume (it can't be done in-game, of course) rearranges windows and desktop icons to fit on a 640x480 display.  This game is a hot mess, and I can't recommend it even to those who remember it fondly from a best-forgotten era.			"

												Very amusing little puzzle game.  Plays as a bit of a Myst clone, only instead of point and click you have to control the character as if it were an adventure game.  So shades of King's Quest and the like.  All in all, most of the puzzles are easy enough to solve, there was one that required a number, but the location of said number was fairly obscure.  The theme is very unique, you play as a person turned into a cockroach.  The art style is grimy and dirty and fits perfectly with the game.  There's some gloriously cheesy mid-90's FMV acting, but even there the production values are pretty high with good sets etc.  Yea, I totally recommend trying this one out!There's also a substancial amount of bonus material that the store page doesn't seem to mention.  If you browse to the game's directory, and explore the ""Bonus Content"" directory, it includes things like the soundtrack, making of videos, commentaries, hints, pictures (concept art, wallpaper, avatar pictures), even some source code (looks like just stuff to make it run on newer systems, not the entire game's code).
