Ignore the ""Helicopter Simulator"" section of the game name, as it's not really a proper simulator of helicopter flying. I saw people asking in the discussions about things like trackIR, pedals and joysticks. This really isn't that sort of game so definitely don't buy it if that's what you're looking for. This is a search and rescue game that basically gives you a helicopter with basic controls (which are okay to handle but I found it a bit difficult on the landing) and gives you a number of missions where you must go and save people in various conditions. The gameplay is very basic, and really feels quite dated. In the first mission I played it had strange requirements that made no sense. Why do I have to be at a certain height for a man to go down a rope to pick someone up? It's like artificial difficulty because the game would otherwise be rather mundane. Sadly it had the opposite effect as it just made it needlessly annoying.The draw distance for detail on the ground is very poor so you have to be pretty much crashing into the trees below to see them appear at the same detail you'd have when you were on the helipad. The models are simple and textures are relatively low quality. The cockpit view was a definite disappointment. It didn't run all that well either, and didn't feel at all optimized. The loading screens were also abnormally long.In comparison to the detailed and thoughtful ""Car Mechanic Simulator"" title they released recently, this is a huge drop in quality. I'm not saying you should steer well clear of this game, but I wouldn't recommend it either.			"

												The flying in this game is completely absurd, the physics are horrible, and even at max settings the graphics are sub-par. A better use for the ten bucks I spent on this game would have gone to buying a second copy of Arma II, a game which I believe very nearly nailed flight physics.THIS game, however, took everything that 5 year old game had, and threw it out the window. I bought this game expecting to be able to fly, not flounder in the air in a physics-defying ""helicopter simulator""			"

												 An incredibly poor game. One can only wonder where Simulator word in title comes from, probably from MFS sounds like ""Pull up"". The quality of the game is incredibly low, barely any animations, no physics to speak of. Helicopter feels like a rubber ball that can bounce off the ground. Cocpit is a static texture, only horizon works. Save your money and don't buy this game, it's incredibly booring and bad. All misisons come down to ""Fly there, pick this up, transport it here"", not to mention that there are no weather effects at all. The only sounds in this game are one and same soundtrack, 60-seconds loop 'radio chatter' and engine sound that is same for all helicopter models.  People you need to pick up can't walk few meters to the helicopter and only way to trigger 'boarding' or 'unloading' script is to shut down your engines. Most of 'disasters' in this game are hilarious! First mission requires you to rescue people from a crashed airplane... That lies 800 meters away from the hospital... I suppose it was easier to cal for a rescue helicopter than, say, drive an ambulnce across flat green field... Or mission to rescue people from an oil platform after a ship crashed into it. Ship is a tiny boat, there is no damage, no fire, people just stand on the landing pad, looking bored, and wave their hands either greeting you or begging you to look at them... Anyway, this game isn't worth your time or money.			"

												While most people knock this game for it's bad controls and graphics, I for one, am having a great time with this game. I find the controls are odd at first, but then again I've never flown a helicopter. While I do not have a joy stick, the keyboard controls are completely customizable are becoming much easier with play. In my opinion they do not inhibit gameplay at all. Besides its comic relief when you accidently blow up from hitting a tree because you put too much deceleration while trying to land. The blury graphical ""problem"" that I've seen mentioned can be easily fixed in the options menu by turning off depth blur and movement blur. All in all, I think this is a fun simulator that is worth giving a shot. I would suggest waiting to pick it up on while it's on sale though.P.S. you get to pick up a beached whale in the third mission			"

												(Sim experts can skip this review. This is more for the people who are unsure if they should invest time and money into flight sims or not.) This game has received a lot of flak in the reviews and some of it it really do deserve. However at this time there are only two helicopter sims on steam - not counting plane flight sims - that have helicopters so you are not exactly having too much to choose from.So why the positive review? This game is at this time the best entry level heli sim on Steam. Better than a certain other more known game.  Yes i know THAT game has got tutorials too but it is not so good for newbies. This game does not waste too much time on tutorials and you get into action fairly quickly and get a semi-realistic engine to play with. For a newbie that is enough. Pointless to discuss 'realism' if the potential crowd is not even sure they want to be here in the first place.  I am still doing training on that other game after 2hours and that is critical if you are not entirely sure you like the genre. Turns out i like this but i did not know it until i played this game.  I am currently in the process of getting myself a HOTAS setup so i guess this means i want moar of this stuff and will move on also to plane flight sims.  Now a little while ago i was overwhelmed by the stuff in certain other sims and i was not getting anywhere. Then along came this little game with training wheels on. Game does not carry you very far as the missions get really annoying but you do have some fun for awhile and the free flight mode helps. Therefore i say there IS a place for this game on Steam. Just know what you are buying. Advanced players will not get anything from this. 7/10edit: Played the game with a simple Logitech 3D pro joystick.			"

												The ideas are good, not followed by the execution, unfortunately. The graphics are just below the standard for 2014 game, and what's the most important of simulator games? Yes, the control mechanism, UI, and tutorial. And none of them was implemented properly, it said partially controller support, right? Don't be fooled by the indications of that, and my Xbox controller (well it works with almost wide range any type of games) didn't work at all. Well at least I've got it for free so not much complain then.			"

												YES!  I've been waiting for a game like this. This game is lots of fun, entertaining and you can spend many hours of interesting tasks to solve. Helicopter Simulator 2014 Search and Rescue is entertainment, fun and excitement for everyone, but not for the hardcore flight simulation player. You can not save during the play, but that is not negative, because the missions get thereby a higher voltage and you have to stay on task. You can pause at any time by pressing the ESC key. The maps are freely accessible, you can fly around everywhere or walk around. It has many different camera views, from inside cockpit and from outside and zoomable. First Person and Third Person. The missions and objectives are imaginative and exciting. While it is not a simulation in burlap sense, nevertheless one must always be careful how and where you fly. Transport rack system can alter the flight characteristics. You have sent the helicopter control as obstacles such as houses, trees, cranes, etc. are available.I can recommend this game each of you with helicopters performing work orders such as search, rescue, transport etc. Most Helicopter simulations are either primitive and boring or have a very complicated and complex mechanism in the control. In this game, you have to not torment with complicated skilled technical details. The keyboard is completely configurable. I like to play with mouse and keyboard but you can also use the joystick. With the latest update, many problems have been solved and I have found no more bugs. The sound of the helicopter is acceptable. The graphics quality is not comparable to modern expensive high-end games, but for the pure helicopter jobs, it is sufficient. An increase of the development potential in the graphic quality would be desirable, because who does not fly like a beautifully designed landscape. ;-) I play with a resolution of 2560x1440 and the game runs very smoothly. For this game, I would have gladly paid more. Compared to other helicopter games it is more than worth the money.My personal opinion, the negative reviews of the hardcore simulation players, the game does not do justice. it's not a arcade game but also no real simulation. It is for those players who want to play the exciting helicopter missions like, who like to carry out support orders and a challenge in solving complex and tricky requirements with the atmosphere and the thrill of a helicopter, but their playing time do not want to invest in complicated technical manuals and control.

												Search and Rescue may not be for the hardcore flight simulaton gamer. It is not fully realistic, but still you'd better have a Joystick with some axles for it. It is somewhere in between of Simulation and Arcade.Compared to Sim copter this title is more simulation and more serious. Where in Sim copter you flew around in a city and things happened which you had to clear, in this game you can fly around on different Island maps and things only happen, when you start a mission with a specific objective each. For each mission you can choose one of the helicopters that can do the job (not every Helicopter is available in every mission). There is no career mode where you get better Helicopters after some time of playing. At least there is no career mode, yet.What makes it absolutely worth it's money is the feedback of the devs and the overall communication between customers and developers. Main Problems that people had with the release version already are solved a few days after release. Other things are going to be implemented soon to improve the game experience.There's a lot of crappy simulators out there, but it seems like the devs of SaR do everything for this game not to be one of them. And so far, they're doing a good job.A few improvements here and there, and in my oppinion this game could be worth more money.Graphic junkies might be a little bit diasppointed, but for everyone else the graphics are absolutely appropriate.The music is annoying after a while, so I already set it off.All in all, If you want to extinguish fires, carry stuff around and rescue people with a helicopter, this game is for you.Could it be better ? YesIs it still fun ? YesIs it worth its money ? YesIs there support ? Absolutely Yes			"

												I bought this game as my son loves helicopters and it is absolutely not violent for him at his age.We have finished 5 missions so far and I came up with the followings:The graphics might be outdated, but living in the retro/indie era it is not that relevant I think. The feeling that the game gave so far as I can fly these coffee-mills is more important for me.The only annoying thing for me is the music, as it didn't match the picture I get when I was flying over the woods or the coastline, so I switched it off completely. The last thing a pilot needs is a nerve shocking tune while performing fine aerial maneuvre.Controls are almost like controlling an RC helicopter, takes some time to practice, and then you can even hover in a brain surgeon to perform a lobotomy through the ♥♥♥♥♥♥... on a space slug.As it is not an arcade style copter game - when you push forward, the heli goes forward -  I can understand why people are freaked out on this, but still there is the ""simulator"" word that has to be interpreted well. And seriously, people, crash a couple RCs before bashing the controls of this game. ;)I love the office-menu concept, it also gives some extra to the feelings, also that you can choose a variety of helis, and not have to wait for some XP based unlock to happen; you get to choose those which are fitting for the mission.

												I have played differant version of search and recure in the past. As both a fight sim enthusist as well as someone who has flown helicopcters in the past (both sim and real) I have been impressed with search and resuce series. however I can can firmly state that this is one of the worst helicopter sims that I have played. The joystick support is beyond reduculious. For example to use the collective (or thrust if in the chinook) you can only be in one small quadrant of the full up position, yet that still does not stop the collective from just dropping you into full down. Also no aerodynamic principals are considered. there is a large airfoil in the rear called a verticle fin this is designed for stability during forward flight allowing your helicopter to fly straight and effectivly reducing the ability of the yaw pedels to effect flight. Again this is not the case in this game. cyclic controls bank and direction only pedels control yaw only. perhaps this game is best suited for the mouse and keyboard however it is not very good and simulating real flight.

THEN THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU.I would't recommend this to friends beuase it's picky, hard and not fun, still on mission 1 after 15 tries. I REALLY wanted to give this game a go. BUT man I couldn't fly worth a ♥♥♥♥.. i spent .99 to get this in a mispriced bundle and so far.. I think i overspent. save yourself time and frustration instead.. punch yourself in the balls.. call it a game.. and you'll be richer and happeir than ifyou played this no physics helicopter masochism game.

												I have been a virtual pilot for many years on MSFS (FS2002, FS2004, FSX) and fly on occasions, add-on helicopters such as the awesome Dodosim Bell 206 for FSX. Must point out that it causes me many CDT's, even when scenery and weather settings are to minimal. But that's another subject entirely.My expectations were real low of this ""game"", after reading the absolute bashing of reviews. Of course the helicopters in Search and Rescue are not comparable to highly simulated models such as the Flight One Bell 206, and Aerosoft Sikorsky BlackHawk, neither the UH-1A, KA-50, and Mi-8MTV2 from DCS products.The term ""Simulator"" should be removed from the description, to diminish the negativity it receives by the boat full. Concerning controls configurations, I had not much success pairing my Thrustmaster Hotas T-Flite X and ""brother"" T-Flite Stick X. When operating cyclic inputs, the view changed automatically, creating random points of views. Going back and forth in the menu, was not fruitful. I could not deactivate the unintended view actions from thoses axes.I will retry later.My new Logitech F310 gamepad came to the ""rescue"", and I was quite surprised by it's compatibility with this title. I do believe that it is a Cardinal sin to fly a helicopter without a proper joystick (and pedals if possible), but again this reviewer was very impressed with the results of the F310. I tried mapping the controls of the gamepad, but this was not going to happen. I accepted the default mapping of the Logitech Gamepad buttons, and within 20 minutes the adaptation was very intuitive. Many scenery details were realized when I got to use HSSR, mainly the eye candy features all around me when walking around the airport. Vapors emanating from the hot tarmac, tropical birds flying and singing, falling leaves from moving trees, animated trucks, cars, and people in the vincinity, detailed clouds with movements, sun rays creating shadows, a full moon, superb water effects, well modeled structures and buildings ect. Talking about water effects, in one those missions with heavy rain, I would suggest strongly to the developers, installing windshield wipers. They do exists on simulated helicopters. In fact for the veterans of a SAR 4, some might remember having them, even though they were not utilized to their real efficiency back then.Must point out that ATC communications are accurate but passive, meaning no interactions are provided. Radio shatter is on a rather short loop mode, but at least phonetic alphabet is used and quite immersing.The omissions of very annoying timers counting down for the success of missions, are fortunately no where to be seen. I must specify that I have not completed the game, and hope they don't materialize. Unless a ""bingo"" fuel situation is implemented in the future, that would be an exception. I would priorize the possibility of having a  ""save progress"" option during a mission. The menu should let the player select these options if desired: Unlock all missions, and all helicopters. Bonuses are to be earned though.The free flight mode should offer the pilot the choice of weather, all regions, all Helicopters.My computer is quite old and still on Windows XP, because of it's compatibility with MSFS, and the multitude of marvelous add-ons for each year. I have been lucky so far with reliability. FPS were a serious issue on start up, until major alterations were done to the scenery/video options. The absence of choosing ""simple clouds"" in the menu, must be offered without a doubt. It sure does not contribute to some flexibility towards better frame rates. This important option is offered on MSFS and Take On Helicopters for example. Missions with heavy rain, combined with beautiful stormy clouds and ocean swells, are a real frame rate killer.Again, my set up (OS) has many ""wrinkles"", and needs all the help it can get.In conclusion, for people not plagued with technical problems, and open minded to plain fun, challenges, and precision flying inputs, will conclude that this game is not bad after all. Very far from it, in my modest opinion. Come to think of it, this purchase was cheaper than the majority of my scenery addons on DVD's for MSFS. I might add that Aerosoft's Nice Airport for FS9 and FSX (DVD), is absolutely stunning. That software is more expensive of course, and readers know very well, that it is in a completely different category.The developers of HSRS must be fully credited for their availability to improve and listen, in regards to customers issues and requests. The proof of these efforts are in the discussions section of Steam, and in updates (actual version 1.068) since it's release in 2014. More impressions will follow in the very near future. So long fellow virtual pilots. A.Latest update from hell: Completely stuck on mission 6. Read all the tips on this site and watched videos on you tube to no avail. Second update: I seriously think that this mission is bugged, meaning that by pure coincidence it worked. After a long rest of the game I gave it another shot, doing the exact things as before and somehow it worked. I still wonder at what worked? Here are a few tips that don't garantee you anything at all... 1- Forget the red circle on the map, it is misleading. 2- Use auto-hover directly over the flames. 3- Fly between 50-80 feet in the thick of it. 4- Girate and do slow back and forth motions, all the while using the E button 2 or 3 times. Be careful not to disengage Auto-Hover, by being too rough on the controls.On this miraculous event, only 2 buckets of water were needed. Go figure.I will say again that all these steps were tried before, and without results. Curiously on fhis last attempt right after climbing on board the chopper, the game advised of an error. Closed everything and got back on Steam, went on the mission, and by pure coincidence I made it. Was this a factor that played a role in the previous fails? I had done a cache integrity of the game in the past. At the end of this mission you have to release your empty container of water at your base, and if your forgot that the ""G"" key lets it go, you will not be able to finish this ""lovely"" mission...  I had tried this mission way too many times, and something is terribly wrong here. Trust me on that one. A cheat code ""Skip Mission"" is needed badly, when a software glitch is obviously the culprit here.Was this a random event, that the software ""decided"" to make me finally stop the forest fire? I will never replay that mission. Ever.Epilogue: European theater mission #4. Again stuck with mission fires to stop, carbon copy of mission #6 first version. Have tried 20 times, that is it. I quit for good. My lemon award to the people who designed those bugged missions. You should not been part of this game, you ruined it.PS: A SAVE OPTION DURING MISSIONS MUST BE IMPLEMENTED ASAP.

Update 2 - Sep 30, 2016More on physics - There's strong wind effect during stormy weather which makes landing hazardous. Heavier chopper mitigates it but reduces room to manoeuver.Difficulty - Hard when landing spots are located in tight spaces although plenty of space is available nearby. Easy when trees aren't solid.Update 2 - Sep 19, 2016 - editing and some additional infoTL;DRIMO this game is awesome! BUT mission design shows lack of careful planning. Maps have interesting landmarks worthy of some sighseeing trips.Update 1 - Sep 14, 2016 Mouse control: Mouse works in 2 modes but it doesn't turn like an FPS shooter; left/right banks and up/down pitches the copter. Turning left or right requires pressing left or right button and the response is identical to pressing the keys A or D; they both seem to rely on repeat rate. GraphicsPerformance drops in the vicinity of buildings and/or when weather effects are on. This is normal, no cause for disappointment here. Turning off some options or lowering them improves frame rate; 60 fps is achievable except during heavy rain but that may be due to my rig running on potato chips.Search light has no blend or dispersion, it has hard edge.Glitches1) When returning the water bucket to it's original location, if it wasn't dropped from the correct height it stays put in mid-air.2) Western Europe map, mission 4. Stuck truck doesn't appear 2b lifted but mission can still be completed.3) Exiting chopper too soon b4 mission is declared successful prevents completion of mission.

GameplayThere is no campaign or career mode hence no economic aspect of simulation like costs of purchase, repair, fuel or salaries. No worries about resources needed for operations. Incidentally fuel is either unlimited or a non-issue and no mission is time limited which means great stress free flying experience. You only need to master flying the different types of choppers and skillful handling of tasks. By now you might realize that proficiency at different tasks is directly proportional to flying skills and requires fine control. Auto hover is very helpful in this regard but there are achievements which can only be attained by non-reliance on auto hover.The same mission may take place at different time and weather conditions. Time and weather conditions change from mission to mission presumably calculated based on time taken per mission and free-flight mode. There is a manual override feature where you can set your preferred conditions however certain missions may have preset conditions.PhysicsDifferences in helicopters' handling and engine sound are noticeable. Heavier choppers handle predictably like a fat cow if cows can fly that is. Physics has 2 modes; accelerated collective means double tap of ascend or descend keys causes max rate of climb or descend respectively. Non-accelerated means more gradual and natural elevation changes.Flight control is understandably difficult for many people because auto-centering / levelling is too slow except when auto-hover is used but auto-hover degrades flying into a stop and go motion unless the keyboard is repeatedly and rapidly pressed. Perhaps using a mouse or other controller could smoothen movement.Music and soundOMG music is grating and annoying; frequent use of brass crescendos give the impression of flying in a warzone. There are several tracks but all sound samey. Fortunately music level can be turned down to zero.The seemingly random radio chatter though is quite interesting. It seems to be aware of what you're doing or seeing and respond accordingly or it may just be coincidental i'm not sure which. Perhaps it's just a collection of com chatter / phrases played at random. Additional feature like some direct communications with Control Tower would be awesome but i don't think it's essential since this game is about tasks rather procedures.  The inclusion of com chatter add  to the atmosphere of piloting.All in all, i'm still pleased with this game as it provides a wide selection of helicopters to fly and a variety of tasks requiring various degrees of precision and technique to perform. Still recommended, especially for SimCopter fans. First basic review belowBought this in a PlayWay Sim Bundle when it was on sale. Great deal, every other game in the bundle works but this, won't even run. It CTD as soon as it's launched. So i shelved it and hoped to play it later after i could upgrade to a new desktop PC. The game's system requirement give no assurance that it would work on laptop GPU. Needless to say i was a little disappointed but i already got my money's worth due to the bundle discount.That was some time ago. Today i had the inexplicable feeling of being lucky so i installed it again and voila! it worked! Frankly i'm not sure what gives, i tried every trick or tweak i know prior to this and it didn't work. My best guess is that it may have something to do with either the fact that it's installed to C drive or that i had to manually assign High Performance mode to AMD Catalyst app or both but i'm sure i did that before and it didn't work. Anyway the game runs smooth at 1280x720 in high detail with AA at medium, Anisotropic Filtering On, Bloom On, view range set to high, shadows quality medium, Depth Blur On and Motion Blur On. Those are the settings set as default on first run. It's playable and there's no noticeable lag considering that the game recorder was also running and recording the game as it is played. One thing that might be different this time was that it was running at 720p windowed mode on my external monitor. I remember now that not all games can run at 720p on my laptop native resolution of 1366 x 768.Options available in menus:

			I finally got this game to run on my laptop with Radeon HD 6770m. The first few times after it was just installed, it won't run so i left it for a later date.		

So take note of 3 important points if you're using a laptop with AMD Radeon GPU:Install on C driveSet AMD Catalyst driver app to use High Performance mode. This may need to be done manually if the game crashes immediately.Try diverting display output to external monitor which supports 720p.Now that we've got some technicalities out of the way, lets move on to a basic review as i've not played much of this game as of yet.Graphics quality - i haven't scrutinized the trees or the NPCs closely as these serve decorative rather than functional elements but looking at the scenery from any of the helicopter views, the scenery looks good. The Depth of Field blur effect and AA works really well. There is no noticeable sawtooth lines in slanted menu boxes, helicopter models or cockpit frames. The distant blur effect is well blended and the draw distance is sufficiently far enough to prevent objects from popping-up at the last seconds.Can't comment on the authenticity of rotor sounds due to my lack of familiarity with helicopters. However the sounds seem to be positionally correct. Cockpit sounds are muffled compared to external sounds so that adds to the sense of immersion.Flight control with keyboard is well done. With mouse you probably need to lower sensitivity level a notch or two.Mission requirements are a bit exacting, it appears that positioning the helicopter for drop-off or pick-up have very small activation areas.Mission 1:

			My flying skill is still novice at this stage. Took me too long to position the helicopter at the right spots so i accelerated some segments and deleted a small section of flight before the first...		

I haven't seen any bugs, glitches or crashes yet but maybe it's too early to tell, will update if there are any changes. From what i've seen and experienced so far, i like this game. And the fact that SAR games are rather rare, i'm glad i have this on my repertoire of games to play.One last note: There is weather effects based on what i've seen on YT.Score as of today: 6/10			"

												I can't stress enough how bad this game is. I thought I could get  enough out of it to be worth the small price, but I don't feel like It's even worth that.The absolute primary problem with the game is the awful controls of the helicopters. The worst part is that they couldn't be bothered to add joystick controls. You're forced to use the keyboard, and lack good references to how your cyclical stick is positioned. This makes hovering a massive pain, and given this is most of the game .. well, most of the game is a massive pain too. The game also interprets a couple of quick button hits as a desperate need to do something extreme, so you could end up dropping out of the sky or shoorting far away from your mission target. It happened far too easily and far too often that I'd be just about complete when the helicopter would suddenly shoot upwards and I'd ahve to work my way back down to the target again.Don't bother. Without joystick controls it doesn't feel like a proper helicopter simulation. The graphics aren't fantastic. The whole thing is sadly uninspired. There are plenty of other games out there far better than this for the same price.			"

When contacted, the company said to send them the run log. I did and they said they would issue an update immediately and to log into Steam and look for the update. Still no update.

												After a couple updates the game is now working for me on windows 7 64 bit. Thanks guys for the update which fixed what ever the initial problems were :) As for gameplay it's actually fun. Graphics were decent. As for controls I played with keyboard and mouse and that worked nicely. You can either use keyboard only or mouse only or even both at the same time which I thought was nice. Sadly I wasnt able to configure and assign the proper buttons and axis on my hotas joystick and throttle, and the throttle didnt work at all. Aside from that it wasnt too bad. The game just flat out refused to recognize my combat rudder pedels and it seemed to intergrate it all into the joystick. Also tried an xbox controller and it was ok for the most part except on the right thumbstick where it seemed a bit too sensitive or something cause it would pan the camera views by itself when I tried to pan around, even a little touch would set it off wandering around the screen. And yes I did calbrate it in windows before I played. This usually dosnt happen in other games when using the xbox 360 controller. I might suggest to add settings to adjust sensitivity.All in all I'd definately recommend this game as it has a lot of potential. The tutorial and missons were fun, the controls were easy to learn and intuitive using mouse and keyboard. It's not too easy but not too hard either like alot of other flight sims I've played, you know like the kind that might turn off newer players to the genre. So it strikes a good balance between realism and ease of use with a not so steep learning curve. Definately looking forward to playing all the missions and flying all the helicopters now. And this is coming from a hardcore flight sim fan who has played them all.			"

I have over 20 games that I have purchased...and 95% over them are not work properly....this is disgusting!I do not intent to purchase ANYMORE games from Steam...I encourage everyone else also stop purchasing JUNK from Steam.

												While I actually enjoyed this game a little I can't recommend it if you are either short on cash or short on time. There are simply better titles (even helicopter flight sims) out there.If however you do decide to play the game then try to use a xbox 360 controller as it makes the controlls somewhat more bearable.Pro:+ Helicopter Sim+ Freeflight Mode (with Points of interests to visit)Con:- Missions are the same (fly to x, pick up y, fly to z, (optionaly repeat step 2-3) fly back to base)- Annoying controls (and no, I don't think this is comming from the simulation aspect of the game)- Graphics are quite dated (for 2014 standards)			"

												Yet another terrible game from PlayWay... An awful control system makes this game near unplayable. In addition, the game insists on playing in a window with the soundtrack at full volume. I lasted about five mins before I had to quit. I only paid 79 cents for this game in a bundle, it is in no way near worth the full price of $7.			"

												As a simple game to pass time, I thought it was great, but all of a sudden the controls stopped working. I tried reverting to defaults, but even while standing still, my character is gliding forward and when in the chopper, none of the tilt controls with the mouse work anymore. It's frustrating when such a simple game stops working properly. Anyone else have this problem? I cannot recommend this game as long as I'm having this problem.			"

												This game has great potential, but I would not reccomend this game. I can imagine that this game could be fun, but only if I could contol the helicopter. The controls are horrible (I have tried using a keyboard and Logitech 3D Pro joystick) and don't work, making this game essentially unplayable. I have played this game for 99 minutes, just trying to complete the first part of the first mission, but have had no success. I got this game on sale, so I did not spend that much on it, and the money is not what annoys me, but rather the time and effort I put into trying to use this game, which I think I really would have enjoyed if it worked. I never leave negative reviews and own many excellent simulators; I also think that this game has great potential, but I just really can not reccomend this game.			"

												It's not very good, not even as a joke.I bought it because I had a dollar looking at me on my Steam account and I decided I wanted to get a funny and broken game. The problem is that it isn't really that type of game. It's not as broken and silly as other simulators, but It's also not a very good representation of flying an actual helicopter and saving people. The game is exceedingly average I think. The flying controls are rather basic and a few automations that the game gives you (auto hover comes to mind) destroy whatever fun the game can offer. Once you realize this the game is just a repetitive mess. It has maybe two songs in it, some rudimentary character models and animations. The environment is pretty bland, generic, and muddy looking, and to top it all off the game has an unnecessarily annoying depth of field that is too blurry and shifts focus too often. The game is quirky in these regards as the animations, voice acting, and character models are laughably pathetic, but that can only really carry the experience a half an hour at most. The rest of my playtime was spent looking for a way to find utility in such a bland game.  Needless to say, I never found it.			"

												This game does not worth the money, this is not a simulation game, not even remotely close to one, i already played arcade games that had better handling that this game, the simulation word here, is to give a impression of something the doesnt deliver.Helicopter is nearly impossible to fly and controls don't make any sense, i find hilarious how serious the dev was when naming this game, even was arcade game, it fail miserably.Im still going to try to make my purchase worth while, and that is the only simulation i will ever get out from this one.

												This is a great little sim, the running is smoth and easy. I have no problems with this fine simulator. So if you like rescue sims then this may be the one for you.Dispite many problems in the past it would seem the producers have set things to run how they should.How about some mods Please?			"
