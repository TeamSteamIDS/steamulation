												I think I just gave the computer an ♥♥♥♥♥♥.I was worried; this company's games usually put message over gameplay, but Luxuria Superbia is intuitive and relaxing, even without a joystick (although I think that would make it better).There's an option to turn off the text, if you get tired of sexy encouragement.  The ""stimulate it -- but not too much at once"" mechanic is a lot more fun than you'd think from just reading about it; you want to keep the flowers at a good level of happy and blushing, but not just steamroller ahead for the goal......or it gets sort of dissatisfied, shuts you out and tells you ""that's OK; these things happen.""Frankly, I feel like the better I get at this game, the more likely I am to be spared when Skynet becomes self-aware.  Or SHODAN: call me!edit: Oh, I didn't realize you couldn't say that on Steam.  I assisted the computer in climaxing as I would a very special ladyfriend.   ""La petite mort;"" that's what I meant to say.			"

												Tale of Tales doing what they do best - beautiful interactive imagery, which evokes something in you. Probably, their best overall project, mostly because it ditches all the parts, that detract from the experience and leave just what they can do best. This time, they decided to focus on ideas of sex and passion and did their job amazingly, despite the minimalism of the game. You stimulate flower, try not to get it to climax too early and look at pretty visuals and listen to nice tunes. Simple, yet beautiful.That said, this is one of the still rare examples, where the game would definitely benefit from playing it on a touchscreen - it's pretty obvious, that the game was designed with ""touching the flower"" in mind, and using just mouse on PC doesn't feel as good. Even more surprisingly, gamepad can offer a more interesting approach with it's two sticks, but it still clear, that touchscreen should be the way to experience this game.Also note, that the gameplay described in the first paragraph is all there is, so you might find it really boring really quick if you're wishing for something more.

												Once innuendo is pushed too far it becomes straight talk - so let's just skip the joke and dive right in. This is an edging simulator plain and simple. There are points to touch along a tunnel that excite it and if you don't let it calm down between touches the level ends prematurely. But much like resisting an ♥♥♥♥♥♥, everything is beautiful and enjoyable, and yet the urge to slip off that tightrope, to just go for it, stops it from being a truly satisfying experience. Though it does get better after a playing couple of levels, the constant repetition quickly knocks out the built up excitement, leaving behind a game not unlike an old screensaver. Does Luxuria Superbia accomplish everything it sets out to do? Almost assuredly. Is that something worth more than a cursory glance? Probably not.			"

												Fair warning, this review might get weird. But that's sort of hard to do when you're talking about a game that is a giant metaphor for sex. Luxuria Superbia is a game about making love, thinly disguised behind the notion of making flowers ""bloom"", placing you in the ""role"" of a hypothetical♥♥♥♥♥♥♥flying through an infinite ♥♥♥♥♥♥. It's both incredibly strange yet oddly alluring, like something you know you shouldn't enjoy but can't quite pull yourself away from it. All the same, it fails entirely at being anything more than a very unusual art project; hyper sexualized (though not at all pornographic) and occasionally even beautiful, but shallow and tedious as an actual game.Though I'm hesitant to say you actually ""play"" Luxuria, interaction comes in the form of you flowing through colorful tunnels, with burst to life as you touch petals that come along the path, with the goal being to keep as much color showing without entirely filling up every side and ""finishing"" the flower too soon (which results in a disappointed message on screen asking you ""what went wrong""). The longer you can stay in a flower the more points you get (which are gained faster when more color is on screen), and the happier the ""flower"" will be at the end. That's really all there is to the ""game"", which straddles the line between interactive entertainment, and something you'd find on a perverted corner of the internet. Every moment is tinged with a highly suggestive undertone, though I wouldn't call it subtle, for as soon as you begin to get deeper into a flower much of any pretense is abandoned as the developer makes sure you know exactly what they are symbolizing.Playing Luxuria Superbia made me feel dirty, like I was a kid stumbling upon his father's secret magazines and proceeding to throw away my innocence. It's awkward and maybe a little uncomfortable to sit through, but at the very least I can't knock it for being anything but unique and artistic. Once you get past the erotic outer layers though, you are still left with an incredibly boring and ultimately pointless experience that grows tiresome before you bring your first flower to completion. I couldn't say quite how I feel about the analogies the game presents, but my opinion of the portion that makes it a game at all is very clear, that being one which I couldn't wait to abandon and really have no explanation for why I started in the first place.Let's just say Luxuria Superia is weird, and you would probably be best to leave it by the wayside in favor of more traditional forms of pleasure.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

												I'm... a bit conflicted about this game, let's put it like that. Luxuria Superbia is a game that leaves many suggesting images in your mind, without ever getting absolutely explicit. Still, it has very, very, very many allusions to the more pleasurable sides of life. (Gods, how can I review this without feeling twitchy? I don't even know.)Alright.I played with both a mouse, and with a X-Box controller. (Thanks to a friend, I got to try the controls for a controller). I absolutely recommend using a controller for this game, as it will be all about the... well...Okay. *deep breath*The game is all about teasing flowers. 12 different flowers, in different colors, accompanied with music and strange suggestive phrases coming onto the screen. (There is no way for me to review this without me feeling naughty, is there? Nope. Nope, not at all.) With the controller, it's easier - two touching areas makes the game faster by at least three times, that's at least my opinion. With only the mouse, you'll also get quite something out of it, but really, try it with a controller and two sticks. (That gives the term 'joystick' a very, VERY naughty connotation. Good Gods.) And at the end of the teasing, when the flower reaches its peak (see where this is going?) you collect seeds to fill the gardens with color. All nice and such.I do recommend the game, but I have to admit there isn't much of a story to it (pantheon of 12 flowers, fill the fields of the pantheon with the seeds you collect from the flowers). And it leaves a very strange feeling, at least with me. And since my imagination tends to run rampant, this game really didn't do much good for me. So. Many. Naughty. Things. *sighs*Okay. Done. Without inserting too many slippery things....dammit!			"

												This game makes me feel very happy and very, very confused. Never thought I would get so much enjoyment and pleasure out of ""pleasing flowers."" ... *ahem* Yeah.This game is very sexual, very erotic, and yet, doesn't strike me as lustful or dirty. The controls (Oscillating both analogs on xbox controllers) feels just as provocative as you could expect, and everything just works together. The gameplay is very simple, but again, it all matches the theme and the feel. It all stays fantastically consistent.Now, I'm off to take a cold shower.			"

												...Do I really want to attempt this.Yes. Yes, I suppose I do.Okay, deep breath, annnnnnd go. Luxuria Superbia is a game in which you must tease, tickle, and stimulate the sensuous concavities of several flowers, engorging them with color and causing them to experience untold delights as you make them burst forth with fertility. It is a thin, laughing veneer of gardening on top of a Beginner's Female ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Instructional Video, and it is gorgeous and rich and every 13 year old should be given a copy as part of a solemn adulthood how-not-to-suck-at-this ritual.As you pleasure the petals, they will go from pale white to rich with color - the more brightly colored they are, the more pleasure the flower derives, the more fertile it becomes when it experiences its final climactic rush, and the faster your score piles up. Delivering too much pleasure too quickly, however, causes the flower to burst early, resulting in a failure; ideally, you'll attend to every spot equally, tapping lightly and driving the flower to greater and greater heights of ecstasy before the eventual plunder. Along the way, the flower will goad you on, dropping euphemisms ranging from the charming and playful to the uncomfortably surreal. While each flower plays roughly the same, they each come with their own surreal visuals, their own beat-heavy background music, and their own sensual banter, all of which combines to give each of them a memorable personality and an image uniquely their own.In the end, the game ends up feeling a little short and a little meaningless, but it's an exhilarating and unique rush along the way. Top marks to Tale of Tales for attempting something as unorthodox and unconventional as this; even if the game's appeal vanishes the minute you finish, it's certainly something you can look back on fondly. If you like boundary-pushing weirdness, definitely give it a go.For the records, the touch controls of the tablet version are far, far superior to the gamepad controls of the computer version, but you should get a pretty solid experience regardless.

												I really, really like this game; most steam users will not (hence the thumbs down).   Why?It is colorful, highly sexual without having any actualy pornographic images (though the text leaves little to the imagination), has an unusual, electronic and reactive soundtrack, and is less a game than an experience.  I happened to think it was a somewhat snide concept, innovative for it's genre, and immersive in an artistic way, and I took it on that level.  I like it.On the other hand, it is not a game built for the PC, but a touch screen, and as I understand it, it hasn't been altered in any way to improve gameplay for a PC.  It has no plots, no really deep puzzles, isn't really a simulation (unless you count stimulation), and is graphically on par with a nicely done flash game.  It also has little replay value (unless it happens to fulfill some other needs in your life), and can be played through in under an hour.  In other words, it was built for casual gamers, and it is casual gamers who shall play it.  Because of this, while I like it, I can't in good conscience recommend it to the Steam community, which prides itself on technologically and graphically superior games and/or immersive, story-driven games.  Great for:  people who really like experimental games, colorful and design-heavy images, and simple gameplay (and innuendo).Not great for:  Most computer gamers (I.E., if you want at least an hour of gameplay, to make use of your graphics card, and/or some kind of plot to your diversions).

												I'm not absolutely sure, but I think this is a game about having sex with flowers. There's probably a word for that. Floraphilia? Sure, let's call it floraphilia. So, you're a floraphile, and your goal is to make sweet, sweet love to an infinitely long flower for an indeterminately long period of time. Appropriately enough, you engage in  the aforementioned floraphilia by tickling the trippy insides of your sylvan lover. Tickle them too much though, and you'll be prematurely ejaculated from the flower, and no-one wants that. That seems to be about it. Nary a hint of foreplay, and as for pillow-talk, let's just say that's no bed of roses either.Piling onto the already burgeoning raft of assumptions I've made with this review, I'm further assuming that Luxuria Superbia is a lifelike representation of boning garden plants, and ergo we can conclude that getting jiggy with a geranium is extremely tedious and barely arousing at all.

												I have never felt quite so awkward and uncomfortable while playing a game before.The game does have a semi-entertaining mindless coloring aspect to it though. Essentially, you use your mouse to try to add color to the ""flower"" that doesn't really look all that terribly much like a flower, while some levels have other leaves growing on the petals that take away the color on that petal if you hit them with your mouse. There's really no real challenge of any kind involved, nor is any real concentration required. Basically, keeping your mouse moving and watching the color grow is all that there is to it.Beyond that, there is also nothing that you're really working for at all, except to maybe take a longer amount of time coloring in the flower next time in order to score higher. Even when the game is ""beaten,"" there's nothing special that happens. You just are given the same screen from which to choose a level to play. From what I've read, if it was accurate information, this was developed as a game for touch-screen tablets and such, and that would make perfect sense. Unfortunately, it's the right kind of game for that, but not really for standard computers.As for the awkwardness, well, let's just say that this game is about as sexual as it could get without showing any skin, as it urges you to hit the right spot and make it feel so good while you kiss it slowly, and so on. I'm still not quite sure if it's really some x-rated simulator masking as a flower game or not, but needless to say, playing it with family in the room made me feel really weirded out.So, for all the reasons detailed here, I really can't recommend it. For my part, I'm just glad that I got it in a bundle, because the  small amount of positives come nowhere near approaching the negatives as far as this game is concerned. The only reason I even found myself continuing to play it at all is that it took so little time that I was willing to hold out and see if there was more to it later on. Now I kind of regret that, but at least I can delete it knowing for sure that I didn't miss anything.			"

												Luxuria Superbia is an acid trip the likes of which I have never seen before.  It is an incredibly simple game about... I don't know what, but it's really fun.  All the player does is use their mouse to create color by clicking on certain parts of the screen.  It's fun comes from the fact that we were all once five years old.  It feels like a step back into childhood with it's vibrant colors and simplicity.  I've only played for a short time, but this is a fantastic game.On the OTHER hand, the game has on mechanic that kind of ruins the immersion.  The flowers.  The game has you going through tunnels wich are describing as being flowers.  That concept is easy to understand, except the player appears to be doing... something to the flowers.  If the player creates enough color (Or, as the game describes it, 'create joy'), the flower begins to talk, saying somewhat creepy things like, ""Grip my petals"" and ""Oh yes, yes"".  I'm not into ****ing a flower am I?That portion of the game DOES contribute to the feel of the game, since the creator so obviously intended that.  The game is playable by both children and adults, for the simple reason that children who don't understand what the flowers are getting at won't care, and the children who do are likely doing something age-inappropriate anyways, and still don't care.Overall, creepy, but fun.  9/10 because I feel like I just gave a flower a handjob.  I'm going to see if my shower can burn away the dirtiness I feel afer playing this.  Then I'm going to play it again.  Why?  Because ♥♥♥♥ it, I like pretty colors.			"

Some of the suggestive messages are too hilarious and I was expecting it to next blurt out GUSSET or BICYCLE SADDLE, so I can't take it too seriously. I approve of the weirdness and the unique idea (in gaming), but don't expect too much, just an interesting experiment.

												Video games have a notoriously poor reputation when it comes to dealing with sex and sexuality. Luxuria Superbia makes an effort to change this fact. The main gameplay for a level involves stimulating pleasure buds, reading your partner, taking your time, and eventually building up to a visual and auditory climax, all of which the game delivers in high quality. Unfortunately, the mechanics get a little stale in the later levels, as the biggest change in gameplay is the size of a level. I would have liked to see more differentiation in a level's personality, such as certain areas being more or less sensitive or the walls displaying more color gradation in the later stages of a level. With all of that said, Luxuria Superia may not be the perfect abstraction of sex, but it is a highly commendable one.			"

												Luxuria Superbia is a lovely gardening game that will truly challenge your green fingers.You start the game with a sterile white garden, 11 empty flowerbeds and one with a single pink flower.As the master gardener it is your job to take care of that flower and make it happy so you can harvest seeds, and to unlock the flower of the next flowerbed.This is of course easier said than done.The flower has a bronze, a silver and a gold stage of happines and an extasy stage where it's really REALLY happy.Pacing is crucial, a beginner gardener might try to rush the flower to extasy in the bronze stage but the flower will become overstimulated and you'll have to try again.Once you've made the flower happy enough (though not too happy) to clear the bronze stage you can bring the flower to extasy whenever you want, straight away or later, for example after clearing the silver stage. Clearing the bronze stage also unlocks the next flower.After the extasy stage you can harvest the flower's seeds to bring colour to your garden and move on to the next flower to make that one happy as well.It might be a bit embarrassing (or something like that) at first because even as a master gardener you've probably never had flowers like this before, but they're really encouraging while you're trying, forgiving when you get it wrong and grateful when you get it right.15/10 for a unique experience			"

												(Edited, after some reflection and playing other games from the team)First off: It continues building on the empathy/bonding/understanding cues received from your partner (in this case, a machine, and in a sexual context).This is ""Bring your digital partner to completion"". It's very colorful and pretty, but the whole time you're navigating the pretty pulsating corridor you're pushing onward into, you're getting phrases tossed at you in white lettering. ""Desire me"", ""Please me"", ""Take what you want from me"", and ""Oops"" (when you rush navigating the... corridor).It is very much like The Graveyard, in this respect: will you read and act on your partner's cues, or will you rush blindly forward, uncaring of how your partner responds? It disguises the deeper meaning in almost shooter gameplay, hallucinatory and vivid visuals, and titillation.			"

												I wish I could return this game and get my $3.50 back. I feel cheated because I did not at all get what was advertised. I watched the trailer and thought the game looked like a fun, relaxing color + music game, similar to audiosurf or something. What I did NOT understand from the trailer video is that this is an erotic edging game. You travel down a tunnel (it's a vag, lets face it), as strange music plays, while being given commands to go slowly and make ""it"" last as long as possible. The game gives you commands, like ""buzz in me"", ""you on top"" and ""kiss me"", among many other awkward things. Had I known this game was going to make me feel uncomfortable, like I was being coerced into leading a digital vag into a thinly veiled ecstasy, I NEVER EVER would've bought it. I bet some crusty nerds will think this game is super sexy, but as a woman I just feel used and confused by it. If you want to make a porn game, just make one. Don't mis-advertise it as some cutesy indie game and then cause your players to feel violated.			"

												Trigger Warning: if you've been sexually abused as a flower this might be offensive to you.So in this game the objective is to bang a flower and not sprout your pollen too early, so right here we can already see the unrealistic demands and daunting difficulty this game provides. The flower, that we all enjoy and love, is a sexual nympho that is out to bang all of us and then complain when we don't satisfy it after we even bought it's service for 6 euros.The game is a perfect 'horrible flower escort service' -simulator.10/10; abandon all hope for video games future.

												This game is made for android. PC users won't enjoy the same.. well..If you are into weird games with sexual messages, maybe this is for you, but as I said, better to get it on Android.I didn't enjoy it because the game is simply encouraging you to bring a ""flower"" to ♥♥♥♥♥♥, telling you things like ""oh it happens"" and ""you were too fast"" if you don't click the way you are supposed to - which would be easier with a touch interface.For me, this wasn't enjoyable at all.

												Got this from the humble bundle a few weeks back. It looks more interesting than it actually is.I went and turned off the text rather quickly since it makes me uncomfortable and is completely irrelevant to the gameplay itself. Which maybe defeats the point of the whole thing but if so then the game was flawed to begin with.The problem is that there's just no diversity here. From the first level to the last, the core gameplay changes exactly once, aside from increased time necessary to complete levels. It's not really challenging and even playing one level can get tedious, much less playing them all. The game also seems to encourage you to replay levels over and over, but provides absolutely no incentive for doing so. Maybe there's accomplishment value in it for some people but, really, this is just a mobile game at its core. Maybe it's just not for me but I grew tired of it really quickly and am quite thankful I only got it as part of a bundle.			"

In this game you are touching flowers to make them feel nice, ie this is a game about touching genitals.I only added this game to my steam library so I could post this review. I don't recommend this game unless you want to feel like you're having sex with your computer, In which case I recommend getting it on tablet so you can really feel like you're touching someones genitals.

												""Having Sex with Flowers: The Game""It's kind of like if Dyad were a lot easier and simplified but also talked dirty to you, so about what you'd expect from Tale of Tales (i.e. the people who made The Path and The Graveyard and so on). It probably has more focus on gameplay than everything else they've done combined, but it's still more of an experience than a game, considering the minimal amount of challenge and focus on aesthetics and presentation and the mood it sets. If that's what you're looking for it's kind of interesting though.			"

												Luxuria Superbia is bright and colorful game that simulates the act of having sex with variously colored and shaped ♥♥♥♥♥♥l caverns. To be honest I didn't know what I was going on until the third or fourth color when the flower-based sex puns were hitting me over the head. Basically you have to hit the different rows to get points, making sure not to anything too fast to prevent blowing your load before the flower-thing gets off. The audio is reactive to your playing, with a spine-tingling little bit playing anytime you approach climax. The game is pretty short but I feel like I got all there was to get out of it about half-way through. If I hadn't gotten this in a bundle I wouldn't spend the money on it, and I wouldn't expect that of you either.			"

												This is a fun relaxing game about doing the thing with/to flowers.  It's colorful and relaxing, and I find myself playing it all the time just for a short bit to destress.  Though to be honest I recommend buying it on humblebundle so that you'd get the steam version as well as the smart phone version.  Both versions have their ups and downs.On the PC it's more beautiful, text is more readable, and the music is better, and all of these are what goes into making it a great game.  However on the phone it's much easier to simply play for a bit casually, (it's certainly not a 'sit down and play for an hour' sort of game) and the controls are much better on a touch screen as well.  The controls are really made for a touch screem.  Perhaps if you had a touch screen compter then the game would be perfect.			"

												this game is just... uh....   the controls and visuals are nice enough and it could be quite enjoyable and relaxing... but the entire sexual aspect and the constant messages coming up utterly kill any enjoyment or desire to continue playing.if you're looking for an abstract sex simulator full of really cliche and embarassing sexytalk from your computer, knock yourself out.   (no, really. please injure yourself. you kinda deserve it)			"

												Whoever thought this was a good idea was an absolute moron.This game is the creepiest game I've ever played in my life and was probably created by someone with the human sexual knowledge of a cow. 0/10, would not in fact bang.			"

												This game makes me intensely uncomfortable. I think that's what they're going for, so I can't fault them there. But other than the overt sexuality (flying through a giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is literally the plot of the game) there's not much to it. Gameplay is pretty boring, to be honest. I don't have a controller, though, so maybe that's my problem.Anyway, if you want to be really uncomfortable and play a game where you take on the role of a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥go for it. Otherwise, nah.			"

												Luxuria Superbia is a colorful, musical journey made to fill you with joy. Exciting designs explode from your touch as you glide through playful stylized flowers. It’s all about the experience and the interaction. There’s twelve flower-like tunnels and a garden with a temple. In the garden, you select a flower by turning the dial. When you complete a flower the next one is unlocked. A flower always starts out colorless. But when you touch it, color fills the tunnel. Stay in the glowing flower as long as possible! Play slowly and gently to get a high score. Just pushing through as fast as you can will result in failure. The game wants you to take it easy and be playful. The blush you cause to a flower imbues the garden too. For each flower, there’s a column in the temple. Time spent in a blooming flower makes its column grow. The garden starts blank, just like the tunnels. But over several journeys, it flourishes with color. Bring color to the flowers, bring joy and beauty to the garden			"

												This is a mobile game ported to Windows. You can tell, because it says 'Tap' instead of 'click'. It is also more of an art piece than an actual game. I felt like I was watching an artsy-fartsy French movie the entire time I was playing.Maybe at $3.99(the current price of the Android version) it might appeal to some people, but at $6.99, no way.

												This is a beautiful game about making love to someone. As it's quite a personal experience, many of you wouldn't like it, because at first glance it can be seen as ""dirty"" or even ""sick"" to make a game about that. Maybe, but Tale of Tales does it in such a beautiful way, so I guess i can say for sure - this is one of the most sensual and immersive sex simulators out there.			"

												(Originally posted February 24 2014)Finished playing Luxuria Superbia. Weird game. Basically, it's a metaphor for female ♥♥♥♥♥♥. A game where the mechanics are not explicitly stated (each level works a bit differently, so you have to experiment), and where restraint is required to progress.I didn't realize that this was from Tale of Tales until just now (The Graveyard, The Path, Bientôt L'été). Luxuria Superbia seems a lot less weird in that context, somehow…			"

												It's just weird. You don't really get anything in the end. I don't really see how it's taking people 5+ hours to do like one round, I finished the game in two hours... It's basically about patience, get points (the ring things), and don't fill up the petals too quickly, and hold down your mouse to sort of ""indulge"". It's an odd game, calming I guess, lol.			"

												This is surreal and charming--and overpriced; it's worth getting on sale or in a Humble Bundle pack, but unless you have a fetish for flowers, probably not worth paying full price for. (I suppose it depends on your available leisure money.)That said, the game is fun for people like me who like games with low-pressure win conditions; it's not at all clear when you start playing what you're supposed to do--but it doesn't matter; you click the pretty flower and it explodes into color and moans at you.Flower. Moaning. And saying ""yes"" and ""more, faster, please,"" and similar comments. The only thing subtle about the eroticism in this game is the lack of human-shaped genitalia. The actual game mechanics are subtle: after the first flower event (not sure what else to call it), you get progress bars, and more flowers open up; you can replay each of them, trying to maximize, erm, ""color,"" which is not the same as speed--go too fast, and you'll be told to slow down.... Maybe it is worth full price.			"

												Very odd. I mean, once you register that it is about sex, it all makes sense. Basically, you have to go through a tunnel and make it change colors. Go too fast and the entity isnt happy with you. Go nice and slow, try to max out the score (shown in top left corner of screen during game play) and get gold, then all is well. The higher your score, the more color that will be applied to the pillars of the gazebo you see upon loading in. Eventually, you get the color all the way to the top of the gazebo. Disclaimer: I haven't beaten the game yet so I don't know what happens once all the pillars are colored.You can turn off the voices and text that appear during your travel if those prove to be a slight distraction. Overall, it is not bad but I wouldn't call it outstanding. It's just... weird.			"

												This is a strange, not very engaging game about having sex with your computer. It's not fun or challenging and there's no real payoff to it. You ""stimulate the flower"" slowly so it doesn't climax right away. Every level is the same, you might as well watch the trailer or a Let's Play.			"

												I first played this on my touchscreen laptop and I really liked the construction of the game - I liked the colours and the sounds and the pretty icons. What I didn't like was the actual experience of playing it. I don't have a gamepad, it doesn't work well with the mouse, and I don't like touching my laptop screen. So I bought it on Android - I really love the feeling of my phone's screen - and got on with it much better. It's one of those games that's all about the ~experience~ rather than the score. You need to enjoy the interaction with this psychedelic, surreal environment for its own sake. It's made up of touch music and colours; if you like those things in combination, unembellished by storyline or high scores,  then you will like this game.You really do need to make sure that you enjoy touching your screen if you want to play it with a touchscreen, though. Rub your screen in circles for a full minute. If that feels weird to you don't get this game.Also, it's about sex. Quite explicitly, in a not particularly explicit way (...that makes sense if you play the game). I find it very similar to getting a woman off, in a strange abstract/metaphorical way. Each flower wants something different, you need to find the right rhythm and pattern for that flower, you need to have some patience for it all to all work out right, if you touch the wrong thing at the wrong time you need to start again...and sometimes you try to extend it out but get too excited and finish right then. It kind of makes me want to call my girlfriend or boot up some queer porn for alone time.			"

												Where the hell do I begin with this game... Its.... highly sexual... but nothing is offensive about it. I guess this is like one of those cheap romance novels but as a video game.This game is not for everyone, if i could - i'd give it a neutral rating. Its okay. Its rather boring, and amusing (if you're a bloke and playing with other guys) with the little things it says. It's not exactly clear what to do, and to begin with you will fail often until you actually finish (I guess a bit like real life interactions?).How this is a simulation I don't know. Its just an artsy-fartsy game with a strange metaphor that will disturb most people and you will walk away thinking ""what the hell have I just played"" and likely never speak about it again.			"
