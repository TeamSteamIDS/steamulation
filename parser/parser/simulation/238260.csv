												Here's the thing Farsight....I love Pinball Arcade, I truly do. I have over 300 games on Steam of all genres, but *this* is what I keep returning to. I have every table you've released for it barring two. In your eternal battle with Zen I've defended and supported you time and time again.Then you pull this crap on us.Six month ago you beta'd a new UI and asked for customer feedback. And boy howdy did you receive it. Beautiful splash screens of individual pinball machines were replaced by a cluttered screenfull of muddy low res Zen-ripoff icons. Your iconic ""Pinball Wizard"" inspired guitar riff bgm was replaced by the actual ""Pinball Wizard"" track, only chopped up and looped past the point of obnoxiousness. Menu navigation became more convoluted and mouse-heavy, making things awkward and unintuitive for controller only players like me. All of these issues and so much more were pointed out to you time and again by dedicated Steam users during the Beta period.Then this weekend, I start my favorite game on Steam to see that this UI has apparently ""passed"" the Beta stage, although one wouldn't know it, since *none* of the aforementined issues nor the plethora of others reported to you have been fixed. Not only that, there appears to be no way to revert to the classic, perfectly workable UI. In other words, you asked us for our opinion, pretended to listen for six months, then basically flushed our opinions down the toilet and shoved this new UI down our unsuspecting throats anyway.This is my very first review on Steam and I hate to spend it thumbs downing one of my favorite games of all time, but that's exactly what I'm doing.  You've showed what esteem you hold for your customers, Farsight, so allow us to return the favor. I hope you enjoy reaping the whirlwind you've sown over a UI that you ""fixed"" when it was nowhere near ""broken"" in the first place.			"

												If you are interested in Real pinball, as in machines out in the real world. This is the game for you. All the tables are based on real tables, and does a pretty good job of it. So after playing the tables in this game, you already know what to shoot for out in the real world, and your scores will be that much greater.However, Make sure you run this game in DX11, and make sure you adjust the lighting. (I usually go for 10-15% room brightness and 90-100% lamp brightness, to better emulate how games typically will look like in the real world.)Now for the bad parts. (Why you shouldn't buy this game)DX11Most people will not know how to run this game in DX11, so the game will look like crap tbh. And when you see the same machine in the real world, it will not look familiar at first. (because in RL it will be much darker.) in short, this game will not look like the screenshots to most people. (I'm sure this issue will eventually be addressed.)PricingMy biggest complaint here is that you have to pay extra to get access to ""Pro-menus"" This means you can't tweak the tables to match Tournament settings, where extra balls are usually turned off. This is the biggest complaint I have about that. Some might argue, but I feel this is just a moneygrab. FPSThe game is locked at max 60fps. As someone who has been used to playing at 120fps on another game, this looks terrible. When the ball moves quickly across the table it looks like a series of frames, not movement. Not only does this look bad, but diminishes the feel of the game. For something intended to emulate real world pinball, this is something that need to be improved. Monitors with higher refresh rates are more and more common, and is cheaper than ever, as monitor makers now focuses on 4k and g-sync/free-sync. Nudging = unrealisticIn this game, nudging shakes the table and moves the ball a bit afterwards. In the real world, you shake the table a bit, but the ball will just stay in place. (like moving a carpet under a ball, the ball just rolls in place dues to the inertia of the ball, and pinball are quite heavy.) So in the real world, you nudge a part of the machine into the ball to make it move, like a bumper, wall or the flipper. (I make a point of only nudging when ""slap saving"" or a wall/bumper would hit the ball to move it. So that I don't develop any unrealistic habits for when I play RL tables.)Physics are generally bad. It does a good job of trying to emulate the feel of playing a real table, but combined with 60fps, the collision handling is just horrible. Many times the ball has moved into the same space of the flipper, resulting in the ball shooting off in the direction nearest to open space. Like straight through the object, out the other side. (the nudging doesn't even follow any laws of physics.)3DAlthough you can play the game in 3D, like with Nvidia 3D vision, the game consists of 2D objects, albeit layered. So although bumpers and ramps stick ""out"", they are still 2D flat. The ramps looks especially dull. Conclusion. + If you want something that emulates real pinball, this is definately the game for you. Buy it!- If you want a pinball game that looks better, plays better and takes advantage of all the possibilities a pinball game on the computer can give you. You might not want to buy this game.But overall, this is still a fun game to play, even if this is the ""second"" pinball game you buy ;)-----------------------Edit - UpdateA lot of things have changed and been improved with this game since I wrote that review.The 3D support got completely dropped. (it's all just a 2D screen now) But overall the game is improving over time. Overall - I would most definately recommend this game.			"

												As pinball goes the game play is terrific and Pinball Arcade has been absent from Steam for far too long.  The fact that it had to go through Greenlight is more testament to Valve's incompetence and lack of understanding of the genre.Farsight includes a free table with the distribution of their platform.  Tales of Arabian Nights is outrageously good.  Personally I can sit in one spot from dusk until dawn ignoring hunger or nature calling playing this table.  The music, sound and game-play are all top notch.  Unfortunately the pot ain't all roses and there are some weeds, hopefully not permanently.Graphically the package is a disappointment.  I don't know much about the studio but there are many aspects of the package that are missing or not up to par and diminish what should be one the premier titles on the steam store. The game has shipped with post-processing bug so you must turn off this feature (some tables)  which denigrates the graphical presentation even further.  Still, when it works post-processing is no more than a gimmick to cover up the textural inadequacies of the tables.  The distribution model of the tables created quite a stir when Pinball Arcade made it's Steam debut.  Table packages were treated as IAPs or in app purchases and not as Steam recognized downloadable content.  Problems with this model included the inability to send Steam gifts or the guarantee that tables would be available if Farsight ever went under though I'm unsure exactly where IAP content is hosted.  The claim for the model was said to be based on that there were too many table packages in too many configurations, ""normal"" vs ""pro""  (more on that will follow), table packs, season packs, custom ball packs.   Farsight responded and negotiated a compromise with Valve where the ""normal"" and ""pro"" season packs would be published as official Steam downloadable content and each would have it's own product page.  Personally I'm waiting for this to happen before buying any tables.  The rest would remain as IAPs, still a concern.The ""normal"" and ""pro"" packages just seem unnecessary and unwarranted.  Do people who buy the ""normal"" tables not want the ability to scan the tables or occasionally fiddle with the menu?  Sure, I understand that such features are not absolute must haves but the classification of the packages without these features as ""normal"" is misguided and has been mishandled.  Lacking such features in a pinball package is not ""normal"" and paying up to 75% more for them is wrong and further, should not be marketed to me as ""pro"".  It's a joke and an insult to fans of the studio.   Usually I'm all in for this genre.  I would of gladly purchased all of their content day one but their incompetent marketing has left a bad taste.  I will own all of the ""pro"" tables but I'm not paying a mark-up for a faux ""pro"" marketing technique meant to take advantage of the naive consumer.  I would of bought the package at the ""pro"" unit price if there was no such demarcation between ""normal and ""pro"" but I'll wait for the ""pro"" season discount.  If that never comes then so be it.  It's principle and besides, the free table , ""pro"" mind you, Tales of Arabian Knights is just remarkable, so no rush.Pinball Arcade without question is the best pinball experience to be had.  That's no offense to my friends @ZEN with have worked hard and put out a quality product as well.  In many aspects ZEN's product presentation is vastly superior.  The question is can Farsight deliver more than their excellent engine.  Can they improve the presentation, the interface, improve the distribution of their downloadable content,  improve the textures and lighting of their tables.  Provide Steam integration in the form of Steam friends leader-boards and make the Steam leader-boards just for Steam users, not lump us in with phone and tablet users.  Get your act together Farsight.  Your product does not cast a positive light on your studio.  We expect a polished product.  Pinball Arcade is not that polished product though the pinball is stupendous.Addendum: February 19th, 2014: A Steam friends list implementation has been effected, however it is not integrated meaning you have to be logged into a Farsight account. Your Steam friends show with their Farsight names, therefore your friends may not be recognizable. The posted scores are not Steam specific in that if a friend plays on another platform such as IOS, the scores will show as well.   This implementation is a step in the right direction but it is not optimal.Addendum: September 30th, 2014:  Sometime ago FS corrected the issue with not being able to recognize Steam friends.Addendum: April 17th, 2015:  DX11 Beta is here and the difference in graphic fidelity is huge.  Good work Farsight.  The update was a long time coming but much appreciated.			"

												BIG UPDATE 6/17/2016:Some idiot at the company decided to upgrade the menu to a sloppy, Valu-soft menu from 1997. If you don't care that the menu is ugly and looks like it was meant for a 640X480 screen, it is now a total pain in the butt to navigate. Before, the tables you owned were separate from the tables you can try and then buy. This was very helpful because there are so many tables to choose from, and being able to click a link to get to your paid content was a time saver. Now every table is jumbled together, and you have to strain your eyes trying to read crappy font and blurry graphics to get to the stuff you paid for. There is no way to sort out your tables. Even if you buy a season pack of tables, and click on the link for your tables by season, you still go to the same screen with all of the tables.They have also added a new, ugly overlay during gameplay that you have to make sure you get rid of since it adds nothing, but takes away screen space for gray, fuzzy graphics. Remember when the game just told you what ball you were on? Well, now there are stretched .jpgs of a pinball that are of a much lower quality of the table your playing to look at! The best part is that they're not at the sides of the screen either, but at the bottom, making sure that actual table space is being used for useless, ugly graphics.Oh, and the Star Trek game still isn't fixed.Essentially, if you want to buy all of the season packs and get all of the tables, this is one of, if not the most, expensive game on steam. You will spend about $100 bucks to get everything, but you won't because many tables are boring on a computer. If you want to buy tables individually, now you're penalized trying to navigate the laziest, ugliest, and most useless menu I have seen since the 90's, and I'm not exaggerating. The graphics, navigation, and color scheme are OLD, and I have no idea why you would update to something so pathetic, and expect to clear $30 to $100 per customer. When you add in that the game is almost 13gb in size, no joke, this makes Pinball Arcade the stupidest decision you can make by downloading it. Civilization V is 9gb and Gothic 3 is 4gb, and those two games together are the same size as a pinball game? LLLAAAAAAAAAZZZZZZZZZYYYYYY!!!! You have to download every, single pinball machine because they're too lazy to set up a link where you can download the free trial of a machine that looks interesting to you. You're wasting gb's of hard drive space on tables you aren't interested in because the creators are lazy.Did I mention the Star Trek game is still broken?Save your money, save your HD space, save your time, and save your eyes, and forget The Pinball Arcade.OLD REVIEW:Most of the tables are fine, however most people want to play the Star Trek table, and it's still broken. Everytime I play that table, once I hit over 200 million, there are no more pinballs for me to play with. All you do is hear the music, watch the probes move back and forth, and nothing happens. You can ""call an attendant,"" but since no ball is visably stuck on the screen, you're screwed. It's a shame that if you do well on a very popular table, all of your success is wiped out on a glitch.This problem has been around for years with this table, and other tables if you check around, and I thought someone at Williams ( or whoever is in charge of software quality control ) would try to fix the problem by now. Unfortunately, paying customers have no value once we've paid. Stay away until someone at this company actually starts caring about paying customers.			"

												Pinball simulator that has the licenses to many of the best pinball tables of all time. Must own for any pinball enthusiast casual or hardcore.I played the hell out of the Williams HOF version on my PSP and I had a lot of experience on the real Funhouse so I know how good the simulation of the actual pinball truly is. This is as good as it gets without going out there and finding a real one and it gets pretty damn close indeed.			"

												Tables are WAY too expensive. 'Pro packs' are a ripoff; operator menus should just be included.Not to mention that if you play this game on any other platforms you are required to repurchase tables for no good reason. The data for the tables is obviously the same between platforms.Farsight has a login for scores, and could sync your purchased tables for use across multiple platforms/devices. But they don't, because then you'd only ever have to pay once.Greedy developer.			"

												I LOVE to play pinball arcade. Very fun! It has a much different feel than Pinball FX 2, if you own that,  the flipper and ball action will feel much different. More of a feel of a real pinball machine. It took me a few weeks to get totally used to it and now the differences don't bother me. So if you do purchase the game give it some time to get the feel for it and th adjustment will happen. The graphics and sound are good, most of the tables I have (I have pack one only) feel just like they did when I played the real thing years ago. I enjoy nearly all the tables in pack one except for 3 or 4 of them. My personal favorite, Attack from Mars, is awesome, I feel like I'm back at my old arcade hangout, putting ten bucks of quarters in to the machine LOL. If you love pinball or are just getting into it I highly recommend Pinball Arcade pack one.			"

												Decided to give this game a shot, due to the current summer sale deal (3 tables for $0.01)From what I've been seeing, this game is more of a sim, than other pinball games, Off the bat, the ball physics felt a tad off to me. The ball felt a little light. Maybe I just got use to the physics of the FX2 ball, but regardless, I still enjoyed the game. I've played other pinball games where the ball just doesn't feel right at all, and it ruins the entire game.I grew up during the arcade era. I immediately recognized a ton of tables I would see and wanted to play, but didn't due to me being so bad at pinabll, that i'd just end up wasting the $1 my dad would give me and just play for like 5 mins. He was good at pinball, he would constantly earn free games that he would let me have after he was done with his original credit. There's not much to say really. If you like pinbal, this game is worth a shot. It's really nice how they recreated real tables. It's hard for people not to compare this game with FX2. They're both good pinball games that offer something different. FX offering stuff that could never be produced in a real table, like beaming down your ball in a light saber. I personally like that, but could also go for a bit more realistic experience. This definitely makes you feel like you have one of those giant pinball machines in your home.			"

												Perhaps this is a review. It is what it is.As a small child I spent much of my time at the beach resorts of Myrtle Beach & Surfside Beach, both (then) small towns in South Carolina, USA. Their beachfront pavillions were filled with 10-cent wonders at a time when children of any age could wander freely, alone. I remember the feeling of a pocket full of parent's pennies, waiting to to be magically converted to dimes for 4-in-a-strip sepia photos, flattened friendship tokens, skeeball to be turned into tickets (never really understanding why banked shots worked best), shooting galleries with actual pellets, and most magical of all, pinball. And spending those dimes with the feeling of a slight sunburn in a time when we still had ozone, but didn't yet have sunscreen. And going home when the pennies, and most of the magic, were gone, fingertips smelling like stale tobacco, having spent our last dimes on snowcones.A week ago these memories were undescribable, and quit vague. Then I acquired Pinball Arcade, and all these memories became so very, very real. And memories about becoming a teenager, meeting girls (or wishing to), learning to drive, going to the prom. Going to bars for the first time, usually alone. But even when alone, pinball was there to comfort me when I was unable to talk to girls. Pinball as a way to meet other guys like me that may have never been my friends otherwise. Yes, these VERY tables, over several decades.So I thank Pinball Arcade for reminding me of the pain, and the absolute joy, of childhood, adolesence, and growing into adulthood in a way that nothing else on Earth could have reminded me. Thank you for the pinball, and for allowing me to express myself in this pseudo-review.			"

												I never write reviews, but I was so (negatively) inspired by the recent UI ""update"" (more like ""downgrade"" to what feels like the late 90's), that I had to say something.First, let me say I've LOVED Pinball Arcade.  The previous interface, while perhaps not as intuitive as possible, was attractive and familiar, and at least reasonably functional.  So when I dowloaded the update and entered the game for the first time, I truly couldn't believe what I was seeing; I *seriously* thought something had gone wrong; perhaps steam couldn't identify my current version, or thought I had older hardware or something, and installed and older version of the game over my current one.  But then I saw recent;y released tables in the list...OK, well, maybe this is new. somehow.  I still wasn't sure tough until I logged in the next day...same thing.  I was amazed.I've never seen such a dramatic downgrade in the functionality of an interface in my 30 years as a computer user...seriously.So while the actual gameplay itself hasn't changed, and is still a blast to play, be advised, you'll be dumbfounded (as everyone else seems to be) by the current UI ...VERY disappointing.

												Don't mind my hours because I've played a ton of Pinball Arcade. I first fell in love with it on the Playstation 3 and eventually moved to the Steam version, which I like much more. I highly recommend getting the season packages. In fact, this is put out by a fairly small outfit with a lot of dedication and passion for pinball, so I pay extra for the pro pack to help support them. I don't even mess with the extra stuff that comes with the pro, except maybe ball skins. They're just worth it.If you don't know, buying a past season gives you all the games from that season, since they've already released. Your game (Pinball Arcade) updates a few minutes after your purchase, so there isn't an install, unless things have changed since I bought one last. If you buy the current season, there may only be a few games but be patient. Similar to a current season of TV episodes, the games are still being released and you'll get them as they come until the purchased season is over. It gives you something to look forward to!As an 80s kid, I didn't have money for plunking into pinball or arcade machines. I was one of those who would stand around and watch others play, just to feel the excitement. My father worked in a factory and would sometimes bring home an actual pinball that popped out of a big machine on occasion. I settled for rolling that around on the floor (sad, I know!)But now, I have more than I could ever dream at my fingertips! And they're so realistic! Farsight takes the actual tables and dissects them, ensuring we get as authentic an experience as possible besides playing the real thing. And while owning real pinball machines sounds great, think of the upkeep and expense, not to mention the room you'd need. It's a romantic thought, but this is way better.I have a number of pinball video games, but there are two that rule supreme for me: Pinball FX2 (Zen) and Pinball Arcade. I love Zen Pinball for the fantasy angle. They make excellent tables that never existed so anything is possible, especially with Marvel and Star Wars! But when I want to play something that was actually crafted and made the rounds back when I was wishing I could play, that's when Pinball Arcade comes through for me.I play using a Logitech Gamepad F310, by the way, and it works great!This is my first time actually sitting down and writing a review here (I think), so I hope it was worth a poop.

												Players not used to pinball in general may find The Pinball Arcade somewhat frustrating at first. It's just one of those things you have to persevere with. If you do, you will be rewarded with an experience that hones your instincts like a sport. There is strategy to it, patience, luck, and the need for twitch reflexes. Basically, everything's a target and you are constantly scoring points and bonuses, so it has a highly addictive effect on the reward system of your brain. A great deal of production time was invested in making the original pinball machines, and that finds its way into the game. Buying all of the tables in The Pinball Arcade may seem expensive to some people, but compared to the cost of owning dozens of actual pinball tables, it is extremely cheap. You can even play the table Tales of the Arabian Nights for free. Some of the tables are works of art in game form, and most people will not encounter pinball machines in their local area the way they used to up until the late 1990s. The tables in The Pinball Arcade are replicas of ones from the stables of Williams, Gottlieb, Bally, Stern, Data East, and Sega. Farsight Studios (the company behind Pinball Arcade) have produced a string of previous games that attempt to achieve authenticity and pay homage to the history and culture of pinball. They now own the licenses to many of the best tables of all time.The Pinball Arcade plays quite a lot like real pinball, although the physics are never going to be 100% accurate on any pinball video game, and nudging is particularly easy on The Pinball Arcade. The game manages to look fantastic without adding a layer of graphical effects that couldn't be incorporated into real tables. The tables appear mechanical, although they are of course simulated.Like most other pinball games, there is a lot crammed into an area that's a different shape to a landscape orientation monitor. Thankfully, in Pinball Arcade, you can swivel the monitor 90° into portrait mode if you have that kind of monitor. Even without this, the game is highly enjoyable and one of the best pinball video games ever made. In my opinion it is much better than Pinball FX2.			"

												When I first started to play Pinball Arcade, I felt it was sub-standard to Pinball FX.  However, as I  got to play more of the tables from all of the initial seasons 1,2 and 3, I found many of the tables were brilliant and played almost like the real thing.  I can actually remember a couple of the tables  contained within this series from my days as a student.  There's a wide variety of table types and apart from a couple that I found difficult to  keep the pinballs in play, most were  a pleasure to play.  The graphics may be slightly  rougher than Pinball FX, but I think that's because the developer has tried to capture the original feel of the tables rather than create totally  new digital only tables[ it works.I have found the  high score achievements  in the main were very easy to acquire.  As for pledging money towards  development of more tables for future  seasons. if you buy the seasons on Steam, you pay for all future  tables that are to be added to that season, so beware when backing the tables via Kickstarter.    I've backed  four or five tables via Kickstarter, not realizing they were part of the same Pinball Arcade set as the Steam version, which I purchased earlier this year when they were released,  so I've wasted a good $100 which could have been spent buying at least a couple of the Pro season packs.I mentioned this to the  developers, who have been really good about it and  offered extra's, or the option to gift  the tables I've backed that i already purchased via Steam.One positive that the FX tables have over the arcade version is that you can buy  most of the tables seperately, which means you can build up your collection slowly; very useful if you are strapped for cash.  That said, overall  I think the season packs that   you get for the Pinball  Arcade version are much better value for money.Once all of season 4's tables are added there will be over 50 tables to play.  The first of season 4 has already been added, i.e.  'Phantom of the Opera', the last of Season three was added recently i.e.  'Bram Stokers Dracula'.   Don't   be scared off by the price of these  season packs, when you consider how many tqables are contained within each pack you'll realise  that they  are excellent value for money; moreso if you buy them in a sale later this year.  Season 4 will probably be excluded from the sales,  at least until it's got it's full complement of tables, (10 in all).  The main difference between the  season packs and the Pro packs is that you get  lots of extra's such as  selectable balls, backgrounds etc.  You may be able to purchase these balls as packs via the basic version of the game, but i can't say for certain as I purchased the Pro versions.  I did have to buy one of the ball packs, but it was  dirt cheap (£0.69).Check out some videos of game play:Bram Stokers DraculaJunk YardPhantom of the OperaDinerFun HouseHarley Davidson 3rd EditionAttack from MarsTerminator 2Black Knight 2000High Roller Casino[url]Cue Ball wizard[url]Fish Tales[url]Cirqus Voltaire[url]Star Trek: The Next Generation[url]Flight 2000[url]Taxi[url]Cactus Canyon[url]Medieval Madness[url]Pin*Bot "

												With the recent changes to the UI I can no longer recommend the game.It now looks worse, navigates worse, performs worse, is poorly laid out, no longer integrates with dedicated cabs well etc...A high school designe student could have come up with a better design and layout with little effort. It seems the TPA guys no longer care or just have no pride in their work... Or maybe their blind, moronic janitor just wanted to try his hand at UI design.			"

												You know, in spite of all the bugs I've seen in this game (along with my frustration of those same bugs not getting fixed in the first place), I still enjoy Pinball Arcade and its massive collection of tables. I can't imagine what life would be like without my enjoyment of pinball; Farsight got me back into the hobby with their Williams Collection, and I give them credit for that.I'm leaning slightly more positive than negative, but if you consider purchasing tables, try it out at least. It won't cost you a dime for doing so (well, maybe a huge download) and you get Tales of the Arabian Nights free. Ultimately, the choice is yours and yours alone!To those unaware of what I'm talking about, I've compiled a heavy-duty Master List of Issues within both DX9 and DX11 Pinball Arcade. Some of those bugs carry over to mobile and the next-gen console ports of Pinball Arcade. We PC users are not alone experiencing these issues. Have fun reading the entirety of the 300+ issues:http://pinballarcadefans.com/showthread.php/10511-Master-List-of-Issues-Within-the-PC-VersionORIGINAL: Definitely one of the closest games to the real thing, alongside the Pro Pinball ULTRA Editions. The tables within may seem pricey at first, but when you consider replay value, it's totally worth paying for the Season Packs. Whether to get the Pro version is up to you, though, so choose wisely.This game has helped me become close to mastery; pinball on Steam is basically the only thing I have where I live. There aren't very many machines around me, so this game, among others (although not perfect in gameplay), and alongside PAPA's tutorials, really help me bring my skill level up to a point where I can play competitively. Below is me getting a really good score on an actual Simpsons Pinball Party.

												Pros:Many of your favourite tables replicatedWorks with a controllerMany hours of fun pinballCons:Years-old bugs remain unfixed on several tablesForced zoom to ball launch and other camera sillinessTruly horrible UI designed for handheld devices, readable only with high-powered binoculars, and full of hard sell items that you would already own if you had wanted them in the first place.**** UI has been improved since my first review but is clunky and has intermittent bugs. At least it doesn't look like a pizza now.Latest table has bugs, like all the other tables. Tables go to market obviously with minimal testing.Flipper, ball, and table physics fall a bit too short of reality for pinball nostalgia to kick inTables you will never buy take up space on your driveExpensiveCan't play tournament unless you own all the tables, including the bad ones which you will never playNudge/tilt physics quite poorSummary:You'll have some fun, but don't hold your breath waiting for those annoying bugs to be fixed. Devs love releasing new content but not interested in addressing bugs and other shortcomings. Recent UI changes undermine credibility of the developers who seem have turned their back on loyal customers long ago. For a game whose content is expensive it's quite unpolished. DirectX 11 update looks like a cartoon. A disappointing result from a game which showed great promise initially. Buy it on sale using money you found down the back of your sofa.			"

												As a pinball lover, it's hard to review a game like this. (The binary yes/no of Steam Recommendations doesn't help, when you really want to say ""meh"".)On the one hand, I want this product to succeed, because I want pinball to flourish. On the other hand, I don't want to encourage Farsight's approach to product development.On the plus side, there are the technical aspects: authentic emulation of arcade ROMs, fairly accurate replication of physical table layouts, decent physics and real-time lighting.On the negative side, there's everything else:- the icon, logo, overall design, UI and UX. It all sucks.- buying, choosing and playing a game with a game controller (gasp!) is an utter chore. - good luck buying a single table directly from Steam. Instead, you have to navigate an in-game UI-from-hell.- load times are inexplicably long and unnecessary. Farsight, we're not playing on iPhones here...- table texture art ranges from good to abysmal on the very same table.- environment art is even poorer. (It's been this way for many years -- way back before Pinball Arcade was even on Steam -- so I'm not holding my breath.)The developers need to employ some talented designers.  Designers who will design interfaces specific to the platform, with attention and care. See: Zen Pinball.Farsight often claim that they love pinball. But it's clear at this point that they don't love details. Or game controllers.I want to recommend the pinball, but I can't recommend the package.			"

												I have come to this game very late, but then I have a real pinball machine and saw little point in trying a virtual equivalent. However, I am very glad that I did.The best way to test out the game is to play Roadshow, the pinball I have owned for 16 years. The game simply plays brilliantly, though I have noticed that there are one or two subtle differences from the real thing. The essence of the table is fully captured and it is a joy to play. I cannot recommend it highly enough. The differences from the real thing are as follows:Loops and ramps feel easier to hit in the virtual table, perhaps because they are not subject to the vagueries of real world physics, wear on the tables rubbers, inexact table angles and leg heights, etc. Likewise, it is possible to hit the skillshot on ball launch by missing the shot and overshooting a little, allowing the ball to roll back into the blast zone hole. I definitely can't pull that off on my table.More problematic is the simulated shaker motor. Even on its strongest real world settings, whilst the table rattles the walls of my whole house, the ball itself is not subject to the dramatic changes of flight which occur in the virtual game. I have lost the ball in the virtual game where I never would have done so for real. This is really the only material issue with this virtual table affecting gameplay.More general problems with the game are the failure to implement a better menu system and to not have simulated the buttons on the machines fully. I want to be able to cancel a game by holding the start button without resorting to menus which break the sense of playing a real table. Unless I hit the escape key I do not want my sense of playing the real game to be interrupted. Another issue is the changing viewpoint when playing. The default height setting to view the table is too low, and whilst it shows off the acuracy of the virtual tables to best effect, it is unnaturally low and makes following the game more awkward than in real life.In terms of the price, the game is free and includes the truly excellent Arabian Nights table, enough to keep you interested and playing for a very long time. The table packs are very expensive though, £30 a pop is like a whole new game's worth of money to expand an existing one. I realise micropayments and downloadable DLC are great for games companies, but they do not offer good value to the player. As the game stands I would need to part with £180 to have my own pinball arcade, and my wife, whilst tolerant, is never going to allow that! Pick your packs or individual tables carefully though, and you can have a smaller pinball arcade containing only classic tables. Hell, you already have Arabian Nights, were you to buy Roadshow, The Twilight Zone and the Addams Family, maybe Circus Voltaire too, you could probably play for a lifetime without tiring of them. In any case you can try all of the tables for a few minutes free play so you can always find something to suit your tastes.So, not a perfect simulation, not a perfect menu system, but if you cannot afford thousands on the real thing, it is as close as you are ever going to get. Download and get playing.			"

												Playing on PC with wired XBox 360 controller.  With a severe lack of actual pins here in Corpus Christi Tx, Pinball Arcade is my go-to when I need a fix. The selection of tables gets 7 out of 10. Personally, I would like to see more EM tables in the mix. That said, the availiable selection is varied and all have something to offer. I have experienced minimal issues with the software. It's  great game and I highly recommed Pinball Arcade to anyone who appreciates pinball.			"

												Purchasing Farsight Studios' Pinball Arcade packs has been the worst experience I have had in my cumulative experience with buying video games online.  Their team completely ignores requests for features they have been receiving for, literally, years... they continue to introduce new bugs to their pinball table packs, and have introduced a new user interface that is so unpopular their overall ratings have dropped from 73% to 44% over the last 30 days (as of the last time I checked).  I won't go into detail on these issues as they are already clearly documented in their user discussions... my intent is to let other consumers know how bad my experience has been buying from this company so that other people can make an informed decision about their purchases.  I can assure any interested parties that this developer will not communicate any plan for improvement, bug fixes or for future update timelines, etc etc... they are only interested in selling new content on a monthly basis without any regard for quality or consumer satisfaction whatsoever.I am lucky enough to have been eligible for refunds on most of the Pinball Arcade content I have purchased.Thank you for reading... I hope this helps someone to make informed decisions about dealing with this company.			"

												I played my first game of pinball about 15 years ago. There was a pub right next to my school where we used to skip classes, hang out and play pool. And there was this strange machine. I had no clue how to play it. I just kept mashing the buttons, hoping that the fippers would hit the ball eventually. And when they did, sometimes the machine shook violently, simulating a quake. Almost a decade later I found out that the table was called Earthshaker!. They also had the one with the funny talking clown head — FunHouse. It was partly broken — some of the lights didn't work — but I didn't care. I had fun.The pub is still there, though the tables are long gone, sold to save electricity. Pinball is rare where I live in Eastern Europe. FunHouse and Earthshaker! are the only tables I've ever played in real life and they're both included in Pinball Arcade. What luck! Although pinball might not be as popular as it used to be, people like me, who have not had the fortune to see many tables in real life, can now experience it virtually. That, I think, is how pinball will survive forever even after all production of physical tables comes to an end. For me Pinball Arcade is not just a game, it is a laudable effort to preserve a unique art form.			"

												Yes I've only played this for X amount of minutes - I've seen others troll this on reviews. However this is a very special game you can't pass up at $14.99Think of it this way you get the best of both worlds. Pinball Hall Of Fame Gotlieb Collection and Pinball Hall Of Fame Williams Collection from the PS2 system with some added tables that you may have heard of before. There are about 21 tables total from what I counted and all faithfully play to the original tables. However depending on your system , if you think you meet the system requirements - Be ready for slowdown at certain momemnts of the game if your system resolution is very very high. If your on a machine that barely go over the system requirements, do Windowed full screen mode at the highest screen res you can do, this will turn off V Sync and provide a more smooth experience at the cost of minor screen tearing. I applaud Farsight Studios for bringing these games to the PC and this sale was killer but I was ultimately was dissapointed at the price point which may scare lots of people off due to its $30 price tag per pack. $4.99 is too expensive for individual tables that only give access to 2 tables most. That and the fact that you cant purchase these individual packs online through the Steam store it must be done online.			"

												Pinball Arcade has a single mission: To bring back original classic pinball tables with faithful remakes so that all can enjoy them. Not only do they stick to their promise of authetic tables, they deliver an extremely satisfying experience with them too.Pinball Arcade is classified as ""Free to Play"" with an initial free offering with ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"" table that is in no way limited. You have a full table that happens to be one of the most popular tables ever made! The table in itself is certainly a dream to play on with changing skill-shots and a number of stories that you progress through as you play.Other tables are available for purchase which will provide for many other experiences. My absolute favorite table, ""Cirqus Voltaire"" is bundled in with the also-amazing ""Funhouse"" which is probably the easiest $5 to spend on anything in this set. The physics feel great, and with the recent addition of vibration through Xbox 360 controllers (or other controllers), it gets as close to playing the original thing as you can get. Visually a lot of these tables are not only faithful, but extremely good looking, the post processing alone giving the harsher glare that I remember from the original table in itself, and even better is that care was made to ensure that the dot-matrix-display was embedded in ""Cirqus Voltaire"" as it should be.The one downside at the moment is that there is no ""cabinet"" orientation, meaning that for the time being the tables will have to be played in a standard aspect ratio (4:3, 16:9, 16:10). It has been said that there will be an update that not only offers a cabinet orientation, but that it will also use dual screens so that the game can be used in dedicated virtual pinball cabinets with one simulating the table, and the other simulate the backboards.This is an extremely well done simulator for pinball. While competitors may be good with their own works, Pinball Arcade flies by in a stunning fashion with licensed tables that are faithful, beautiful, and always work. There's more to come too, with the possibilities of ""The Addams Family"" and other major tables coming in as well!			"

Steam Pinball Arcade PC improved physics and graphics 
A Guide for Pinball Arcade
By: BigSilverHotdog

			A collection of handy technical tips and tweaks to improve your pinball experience.		


I had a nice, long, positive review ready to go a couple months ago for this game, which I've enjoyed for years... then they updated the UI and pointlessly ruined the game. It's ugly, it gets in the way, it's annoying and cumbersome to use with a controller or pincab, it crippled performance, and it makes the entire experience, frankly, unbearable. I said it on the forum and I'll repeat it here: Whoever designed the updated UI should be fired.So yeah, nice one guys. You apparently put a lot of work into a UI that turned out to be beyond terrible, you beta tested it without listening to your beta testers (of which I was one -- my feedback was ignored just like everyone elses), and then you forced it upon your long suffering customers without any warning and in spite of complaints coming from every direction that it was a mistake. Great work. Get rid of new UI or at least make it usable without intruding on gameplay and ruining performance and I'll consider posting an actual review of the game. But right now, because you suck at coding and you didn't listen, I can't play a game I've spent a huge amount of money on and actively supported for years, so all you get is this:,,|,,			"

												A few years ago, after eagerly playing Zen Pinball (Pinball FX2 for your Steamers) on my Android device, I've stumbled upon a great pinball title named Pinball Arcade. Being the peasant that I proudly am, it was really hard to get used to its 'simulation rules' at first, coming from the world of arcadey and bouncey Zen Pinball. I've bought some tables on Google Play, mainly the ones I've encountered in my real life, but soon I just let it go, just as any other game played on mobile phone.  When Pinball Arcade finally came to PC, I was really, really happy. First of all, I've wanted to finally start playing and learning to play as-real-as-it-gets digital pinball. But my love never really got off the ground. Wanna know why? Read on.  Pinball Arcade serves as a digital museum of once glorious pinball machines. Recreated painstakingly real, you can't do anything but to stand in awe of Farsight's great recreations. Every machine has been taken apart and recreated digitally and you can feel it. Having played and remembering very well at least 10 pinball machines included in the game, I applaud the efforts of development team. Pinball machines have been separated into packs which make up five seasons so far. The history is all there, legendary and end of an era machines standing back to back: Bally, Williams, Stern, Gottlieb - all there ready for you to try to score on and become a silver ball legend.  Every table also consists of certain two level challenges that you need to nail down to be able to be called a coolest kid in Arcade Town.  The sound of the machines is mainly spot on, except for a few mistakes that have been reported by lively Pinball Arcade community. As for the graphics, Pinball Arcade used to be the main game in town for simulation pinball games before Zaccaria Pinball was released. Yes, the tables look very realistic as models, but the lightning, textures and room surroundings will never let you mistake Pinball Arcade for a real machine. Personally, Pinball Arcade looks better on my mobile device than on my PC and that fact is not really complimenting anyone.  Pinball Arcade likes to brag about its real-life physics, but let's keep it real here. Yes, it is more simulation than arcade, but certain tables are displaying ridiculous amounts of nonsense. For example, my last Black Hole table playthrough, I've witnessed ball going to another table like Mr. Isaac Newton was never born. I don't mind, but if you really expect spot on physics, I suggest you never buy tables in bulk, but play each table in trial mode prior to purchasing because arcade/simulation meter is dangerously varying between each table.  Game offers several ways to play: play each table individually, try your luck on score oriented manufacturer challenge where you need to score a certain amount of points to progress and receive your grades or try your luck and test your skills at official Pinball Arcade tournaments that are being organized every now and then. Also, a menu displays head-to-head option which is coming soon, so when it does, this review shall be updated. Creating third party Farsight account is also something you can do. This way you're making yourself known (or not appearing at all, all according to your skills) on cross platform Farsight leaderboards, beside being able to see your name amongst your Steam friends. The thing that really bothers me are some unrealistically high scores, so I wonder... is there any kind of cheat protection present?  And let's nail down the worse thing about Pinball Arcade - packs are damn expensive. Pinball Arcade is one of the most expensive games on Steam. Packs rarely go on sale, and contents, both their quantity and quality varies greatly. While Season 1 and 2 packs are consisting of 21 and 19 tables respectfully and they're being priced at 27,99 € / $, Season 3,4,5 packs only consist of 10, 10 and 11 tables and let's be quite honest, rarely any of these in latter packs are any kind of classics. I know Pinball Arcade dev team can't really make up tables, but they sure as hell can wiggle and bring those prices down to realistic level or at least put up a sale or two during international gaming holidays better known as Steam sales. Insult to the injury is the fact that if you want to experiment with any table, you need to buy PRO packs which raise the prices to 36 € per pack. Having an option to change ball colour or mess around with table options behind paywall is outrageous practice that really should be abolished.  Latest UI changes got a lot of pinheads rolling their eyes and tapping that negative review button here on Steam. I find it hard to rate the game negatively because of UI, even for the sake of pointing out obvious problem with developers decision. I'm thinking that old menu was fugly just as this one, but at least old one was way more effective for categorizing purchased tables.   I'm on the fence concerning this one. It's a great mobile game that didn't turn out that good on Steam (at least so far). Also, damn expensive packs degraded over time in quality and I can't really give thumbs up to that. I am recommending this one based solely on the fact it's one of a kind interactive pinball museum and it's something to be owned by any pinball enthusiast. But it surely isn't the best simulation, nor best looking pinball game.    ***  Hey, you've liked this review? Hated it? It made you buy the game / abandon the idea of buying this game?

												I've enjoyed pinball in actual arcades all my life, from the mid-80s up through today, and as someone who has played a lot of real pinball and a lot of digital interpretations of pinball (going back to David's Midnight Magic on the C-64) it's clear that Pinball Arcade is a labor of love. It is the closest I've ever come to playing a real pinball table in a virtual environment. While the game can't quite recreate all of the unusual ball physics you might see in a real table (such as smacking the ball against the topglass on freak bounces), it does as good a job as you could expect for a computer. Not only that, but you can always be sure that the parts for your table are in perfect working order, which is not something that can be said of random tables in an arcade.Every table is not only lovingly reproduced here, but you get extras such as detailed instructions on how to play the table, how each game mode works and a general understanding that not only helps you in the game but if you encounter the real tables as well. With a bit of work, you can even play in portrait mode on a side-rotated monitor for a beautiful lengthened table experience. The still images on the store page here really don't do justice to the program in action.The awesome part is that you don't have to just take my word for it; the game comes with Tales of the Arabian Nights for free, which allows you to really get a feel for what the game is capable of. The other tables have to be bought and on their own, the packs seem a bit on the pricy side (especially since I've never seen them on sale), but when you consider what you're getting, the cost per table is $1.50 or less--the cost of three plays in an actual arcade--which is really a steal when you consider what goes into the creation of each table. The Pro options open up some new features that are fantastic for true pinball afficionados, but for those who just want to play the tables as they might find them in an arcade (and not be able to switch things up as if they owned the table themselves), they aren't really necessary.For those considering buying, Season 1 just slightly edges out Season 2 by virtue of having more tables as well as the inclusion of such greats as Bride of Pin-Bot and Twilight Zone. As of the time of this review, Season 3 is for sale but its contents haven't been decided. I actually own tables for the game on a console, so I haven't gotten around to picking them up on PC yet.If you enjoy real or digital pinball, there's no reason that you shouldn't download this and give the free table included a shot.

												Really, I wanted to like this, right from the start. I've been waiting for a commercial effort for years - I've been playing VisualPinball since, huh, forever now.Some years ago, I built a custom Pincab to be able to bring virtual pinball to the next level (using Visual Pinball as a platform of choice). I am sad to say, Pinball Arcade never managed to patch in any kind of satifying pincab support after all these years, which is kind of sad.As for the game itself, I never managed to like the engine, the machines recreated rarely succeed in playing the same way their original counterpart did (I played most of them extensively in my material world) with a rare few exceptions.Graphically the game is sub-par and very inconsistant between tables (some are plain ugly, some are really well done). I saw there was a DX11 update, but I had mixed success on playing it on my Pincab.In-game camera placement is aweful when using a vertically oriented monitor and you've got to choose between unatural deep perspective and not-so-top down camera with missing flippers. Really ?Regarding physical aspect of the game, I can't say it's bad, but it's not feeling like I'm playing a simulation either. I still prefer latest Visual Pinball's physics over this.So mixed feelings - buying this is up to you, especially if you're playing on a pincab.			"

												Download this game and be prepared to spend lots of money to justify the disk space use.Pinball Arcade: Season One Table Pack $29.99Pinball Arcade: Season One Pro Pack $39.99Pinball Arcade: Season Two Table Pack $39.99Pinball Arcade: Season Two Pro Pack $49.99Adding these packs up based on pack options means you are spending 69.98 for the Table Packs and $88.98 for the Pro Packs. Astonishing numbers. There is also the option to purchase 2 Table packs of preselected tables from with in the game for $4.99. Enough on this.Graphics are really nice, Lighting is astonishingly poor, recereation is near perfect. ball movement is completely unrealistic. You only get to play on 1 table for free. You can play a ""trial"" run on every table but thats to the ""high score limit"". So, there is a preset time frame for you to play each table and thats a very low score limit. Easily reached on your very first ball. For me, the POV is too close. I didnt find an option to change it yet. There are some tournament options Ive not really explored yet but doubt I can play them with out paying for a  table pack. Id like to see more options to play against friends in online games.Allowing the purchase of a table specifically or making your own package would benefit this game immensly!In conclusion: Id not download this and lose the disk space just to play 1 table for free. More free tables and lower prices sends this game into a realm thats not reachable by similar games. Id consider paying 10.00 for the game if it included a handfull of tables. Doing so will make the game worth playing and possibly would entice players to buy other tables.Pinball FX 2 although Ive not played as its currently downloading, already looks to be a beter game as the tables are cheaper, you can buy an individual table and also buy all the tables for less than $60.00Dream pinball is also a decent choice for a mere $4.99			"

												Amazingly, the PC version is worse than the PS4 version.  As much as I looked forward to Pinball Arcade's PC release, I was equally disappointed at the poor quality of the release.  Bad lighting, no customizable camera movement, a lack of a decent operator menu for the tables and very shoddy, bug ridden or just plain incomplete translations of some games.  In addition, you have to create a separate account to keep track of leaderboard scores and you have to add money to your steam wallet to buy individual tables.  On top of this , they won't allow you to buy single tables so you're forced to get one table for $5 and you're often stuck with a second table you don't care about.   Notice the reviews they cite? ""Mobile Game of the year?"" Plus, IGN's review is gushing over the (much better) PS4 version, not the PC version.  One of the tables are free so try it for yourself.  Then fire up a game like Pro Pinball: Timeshock, Big Race USA, or Fantastic Journey and you'll see how good pinball can be.  And those tables were made almost 20 years ago!- - -Edit 11/2014:  Pinball Arcade has now been on Steam for over a year and still no DX11 version.  This is in spite of claims that the PC version would become the ""definitive platform"" and that DX11 was coming.  They've also increased the price from $5 for two tables to $5 each table.  I stand by my review.  Pinball Arcade is too expensive for casual players, and pinheads would be better served by buying the PS4 version.			"

												If you ever visited arcades in the 70's, 80's, or 90's, this game is a main line to the nostalgia pleasure spot of your brain. With over 50 tables (and counting), you'll likely never be bored. Beyond that, it's pinball! These aren't fantasy tables, these are loving recreations of machines you'd be hard pressed to find in the wild today. Are they perfect? No. Do they play the same as the real thing? Well there's a world of difference between playing something fully mechanical with all the randomness of real world physics, and that of a digital version. That being said, it will improve your pinball IQ, and many times it comes damn close to being just like the real thing.A note on purchasing. Buy the seasons, as you are paying for 6 tables and getting 10. It's an even better deal for seasons 1 and 2. Yes, that might make the game seem expensive, but look at it more as if you are buying a new Madden every year, only the old seasons work side by side with the new. Seriously, $30 is not bad for a block of tables that will keep you busy for an entire year. Even better if you get 'em on sale!			"

												The slavish dedication to replicating every dumb and chintzy pinball gimmick should be commended. All one has to do is play ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon 3D"" table and see how disturbingly accurate the blurry hologram in the center of the board is replicated.

												The negative reviews honestly make very little sense. The physics are accurate, the tables are incredibly true to the original real-world machines, and the assortment and variety (if, yes, you can afford it) are spectacular. I only own one of the table packs and overall I have been thrilled with every play of every table. Five stars, all around. I just wish the table packs would occasionally go on sale. As a true real-world pinball fan my entire life, that is my only complaint with this title.			"

												I am a fan of Visual Pinball (and continue to use it), but I still find ""The Pinball Arcade"" essential.Pros1)    The Pinball Arcade gives me a legitimate way to license the tables. Free demo versions that allow one to play up to the first high score are also available for each table.2)    Like Visual Pinball, The Pinball Arcade's tables are recreations from real tables that I grew up with. They are not impossible virtual creations that are made much easier in order to expand pinball appeal to a larger audience. If that is 'your bag', check out Pinball FX2.3)    Although much of this subjective, The Pinball Arcade's implementation feels more polished than Visual Pinball.  One example is how the lighting on the board is 3D rendered. Visual Pinball's table-lighting effects are statically added using an image tool. Although the ball physics could probably be proved to be superior (one way or the other) mathematically, I can only say that I find the ball behavior of The Pinball Arcade to feel more realistic. That is not a slam. I would expect that a product that had developers paid to work on it all day every day would have more polish than a product whose developers are contributing “as they have time”.4)    Plug and Play. Download and launch. It’s that simple. On the other hand, Visual Pinball takes quite a bit of R&D to get going (even with an abundance of available documentation). That said, Visual Pinball is worth every bit of blood, sweat, and tears that are required to it going.5)    Supporting TPA (The Pinball Arcade) is really good for the game. The fact that it is available on just about every mobile platform has really rekindled pinball interest with the masses.Cons1)    The tables are pretty expensive unless you buy a season at a time. 2)    The tables are not stored with a ""Pinball Arcade account""; but rather, the store for which you purchased the engine that plays the tables. On one hand, I would expect to be able to buy the content in the cloud (like an Amazon kindle book) and then play it on any device that had the kindle app (buying the version of the app native to that platform if necessary). On the other hand, extra maps for Call of Duty on PC, Xbox, and Playstation do not transfer between each other. At $30 a season, I'm going to have to pick just one platform. I am probably choosing Steam since I can at least go from PC/Mac (with XArcade Tankstick) and use a Netbook on the go. Then again, I'd much rather use a tablet for mobile. So, I may go with TPA on iOS for mobile and stick with Visual Pinball on the desktop.			"

A Simulation Disguised As A Video GameThis is not a ""video game"", as much as it is a simulation that reproduces every aspect of actual, real, arcade pinball machines. The lights, sounds, backglass art, ball physics, flippers, tilt inertia, everything. These are licenced, authentic replicas of actual pinball tables like you would find in the arcade.This is a game for people who want the feel of an actual, physical pinball table--maybe to practice and learn the rules and scoring of individual tables, or just to play in lieu of paying 50 cents a game at the arcade. If you're looking for pinball that plays like a video game, this isn't it. Some tables are unforgiving, complicated, and skills like flipper control can take a long time to master (just like their real counterparts).Most people look at the DLC prices and go ""what the hell, $120 for pinball?"" It seems like a lot compared to typical games, but it really isn't for a game like this. The $30 DLC is for around 20 tables per pack, and individual tables can be unlocked for a few dollars. You can demo any table you want, with the only restrictions being a score cap that will stop play if your score exceeds the high score list. A real pinball machine is usually 50 cents a play, so it's not uncommon to spend $20 a night on pinball in the arcade. When you look at this this way, it's a steal to be able to practice and play at home for the price. Remember, these are actual, licensed, replicated machines, not something some programmer thought up in their basement. Note that if you want to buy a table pack, you can buy either the regular or ""pro"" pack, you don't need both, so the total DLC pricing appears as about twice what it actually is. The pro pack has no impact on the games themselves, but it does give you other options like being able to modify some of the table settings, like tilt control.This includes ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"" already unlocked and ready to play. Purely personal opinion, but Theater of Magic, Scared Stiff, and Bride of Pin-Bot are great tables for brand new players--fairly simple, the production value is great, and even if you have bad aim, there's plenty to hit. Here is a IPDB's list of the top 10 rated pinball games if you're looking for some new tables to master:#1 	Twilight Zone#2	Medieval Madness#3	Theatre of Magic#4	Monster Bash#5	Star Trek: The Next Generation#6	The Addams Family#7	White Water#8	Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure#9	Tales of the Arabian Nights #10	Star Trek (Enterprise Limited Edition)			"

												Video pinball has always been problematic. Some good games have come out of a fantastical, video game take on pinball (see Rollers of the Realm), but attempts to simulate the actual experience of playing a pinball table have always been doomed to come up short. At least that's what I thought until Farsight Studios combined their finely tuned physics engine with incredibly meticulous recreations of the great pinball tables to do the impossible and deliver a game that finally does justice to real pinball.It is tempting to put Pinball Arcade in the same camp as the wealth classic video game compilations, but that wouldn't be right. Those collections are generally a single emulator and straight rom dumps sold for a couple bucks a piece. In Pinball Arcade, every single table is a painstaking recreation of the real thing. Farsight has to acquire the real thing and take it apart, not just ensuring it looks and sounds right, but making sure it plays right by accurately simulating and fine tuning every mechanical bumper, flipper and switch.It is tempting to consider Pinball Arcade and Pinball FX2 to be two competing products offering essentially the same thing (think Rock Band vs Guitar Hero), but that wouldn't be right either. They are fundamentally different and in no way interchangable. FX2 tables are new tables not bound by the limitations of mechanical pinball or the expectations of recreating a real table. Zen Studios, the team behind FX2, only needs to design a table and make sure it plays okay and they are ready to ship it. Based on the level of craftsmanship that goes into table creation, FX2 tables are sold at a very reasonable price, and Pinball Arcade tables are sold at an unbelievable bargain.The Pinball Arcade is a labor of love and that intense enthusiasm shines through in every aspect of this game. If you love pinball and aren't able to collect the real tables, this is your best choice by a country mile.			"

												As a long-time serious pinball player, this looked like a really good idea. Why didn't anyone think of this before?The sad fact of the matter is that if you are a competitive pinball player, you'll have a bad time with this. It simply will not feel even close to a real machine, especially when it comes to the nudging which I normally do quite a bit in real life. In this game, not so much, because it doesn't feel natural at all.The physics are okay, but nowhere near as good as many people have said. Same thing here, if you are a casual pinball player, you might not notice, but the rest of us do. For example, the flippers in the game are bouncy as they should be, but they completely lack the rubbery friction which is so important when you're trying to catch the ball.The controls are nowhere near as responsive as a pinball game requires. Tried with both a normal ♥♥♥♥♥♥ keyboard and an Xbox 360 controller. The controller was better, but it simply wasn't possible for me to play with the keyboard.			"

												I have only recently owned Pinball Arcade within the last year after acquiring a VirtuaPin Mini Pincab running PinballX as my Frontend. I have hear rumors of possible cab-friendly changes in the not too distant future. In the meantime, I have managed to make things cab-friendly enough and, thanks to the author of PinballX creating integrated support, have been fairly satisfied with the results and playbility. That is, until the UI change that totally broke the integration with the pincab and the frontend.The new UI reminds me of an XP touchscreen. If you have more games than can load on the screen and try to scroll down, the display fighte against you and scrolls back up. Just a quick note, pincabs don't generally have mice, keyboards, or game pads. While I was not a fan of the original UI, this one isn't much better, and in some cases is actually worse. And still no cab-friendly support.C'mon Farsight! Help us to believe in you again! Your tables are great! Your UI not so much. Add to the new UI woes no command line support to directly launch individual DX11 tables or multi-screen (playfield, backglass, DMD) support, I can't recommend this to others as a sound purchase.

												Classic Recreations of REAL Pinball Tables....That's all you need to hear. So many negative reviews for being too expensive, etc. Look people, these are recreations of ***REAL PINBALL MACHINES***, there are licensing fees, royalties, etc. involved here. If you want a real pinball machine, you're going to fork over a lot more money. Ok, so the UI is awful, but they are improving it soon. Complaining about graphics quality on the PC? DX11 is coming. They've integrated SteamPlay and Linux is coming. Trust me, this company is not out on a cash grab. They are on a mission to recreate some of the best pinball tables ever made. They are a small shop with limited resources and it is what it is, but make no mistake, they are doing this for the love of Pinball.Gameplay is 100x better than those *OTHER* games. And before you accuse me of being on their payroll, be known that I buy any and ALL pinball games and play them. I've been playing Pinball for 25 years and I enjoy it any way I can get it.			"

												What a massive disappointment this game is. For someone who played and loved the original Williams machines back in the day, I was looking forward to this -- looking forward to reliving nights in the bar 25 years back, 99 cent ryes and guilt-free cigarettes, terrible 80s music, all the memories. You know, without the bar, the rye, or the cigarettes. Maybe some 80s tunes, if nobody's around.I don't know how the makers of this game got the licenses to those Williams pinballs, but I really wish they hadn't. The execution here is barely adequate at every turn, in stark contrast to the overall excellent (which is something I never thought I'd say for a Microsoft Studios game) Pinball FX2. How is this game disappointing, specifically? Well: the UI doesn't work properly, in addition to being just plain ugly. Try changing key bindings, if you want an exercise in frustration. There doesn't seem to be any nod whatsoever to the sorts of niceties that Steam supports, utterly unlike the incredibly well-done leaderboard/friend functionality in Pinball FX2. The physics are just... wrong. The ball doesn't react to 'gravity' in a convincing way, and it only takes seconds of play for the illusion to be broken. The ball shudders and strobes as it 'rolls' in exactly the sort of way a real ball doesn't. Textures are inconsistent, weirdly low-resolution all over the place, and the lighting model is... odd. The 'room' in which the pinball table stands sports textures right out of the early 90s. Maybe that's a sly nod to the time period, but I doubt it. This is, as far as I can tell, a straight-across port of the iPad game, right down to the touch-centric interface. But a game that looked and sounded adequate on an iPad2, and was worth every cent of the price -- free -- just doesn't cut it on a modern gaming PC without an attempt at least a little polish. Worst of all, if you're a Williams afficionado, at least, is that they utterly failed to capture the truly distinct and unique feel of Williams machine flippers. Which is doubly ironic, because in playing Pinball FX2 for the last week or so, one thing I actually said to myself was ""these flippers feel just like Williams' used to"".But to add insult to mediocrity, to actually get to play the Williams lineup of tables -- how I miss you, Pinbot! or Black Knight! -- the publishers of this game expect you to fork out $160 (Edit: 'only' $70 to $90, apparently) in DLC.Are you high, guys? Seriously?There is no way I can recommend this game to anyone but the most serious pinball fans, and even then, even though you might recapture some of the memories they're expecting you to pay through the nose for, you're going to be disappointed with the lack of polish and the pretty significant technical failings.If this goes on sale, with all $160 (edit: $70 to $90, apparently) worth of DLC (so far), for maybe 10 bucks, sometime, it might be worth it. But putting the lipstick of a reasonable price on it still won't make the cynical laziness of execution here any more attractive. Playing this for the few minutes left me more annoyed than anything else -- I hope if you take the plunge for the one free table at least, you have a better time with it.			"

												O.K.  I've played enough of this game to get a general impression of the quality.  I had downloaded it years ago but thought the price of the packs were too high so I uninstalled it.  I recently got an urge to play pinball so I purchased Pinball FX2 as it was cheaper and had good reviews.  While Pinball FX2 is a good game (I bought about eight tables), I found it a bit gimmicky.  I had only played the free Arabian table on Pinball Arcade and thought it was O.K. but it wasn't enough to convince me to spend the bucks to buy a pack.  But I did some research and read some reviews and in the end I took the plunge and bought Season Pack One.  Boy am I glad I did because it is really good.  The authenticity of the tables I find amazing and it has to be as close to playing the real classic pinball tables on a pc as you can get.  I found Pinball FX2 to be more flash over substance where as Pinball Arcade is more of a passion of love.  I read some reviews complaining about a 'delay' in the flippers but that is all part of the authenticity.  On the old pinball machines it was all mechanical so it would seem like a 'delay' anyway because of the moving parts.As for the price, for the £22.99 or so I paid for pack one, I got about 21 tables so that works out at about a pound per table which is very good value for money.  The price may seem high but it is totally worth it.  A single table on Pinball FX2 starts at about £1.99 so it is a no-brainer.I'm just pretty amazed by the realism of the tables - very impressive !Edit (4/5/2016)After some more game time I am updating my review.  I have now tried out a lot of the tables on Pinball Arcade and whilst they are still very good, my only gripe is that they seem to all be retro tables.  I wish there were more modern tables but all the tables seem to be pre-1980's.  Anyway, I played Pinball FX2 some more and found a table view I liked and after playing it some more I found it to be more enjoyable than previously thought and not so gimmicky.So my final conlusion is if you want a retro and realistic pinball simulator with lots of classic tables, than Pinball Arcade is the one to go for, but if you want modern mechanics and tables, then Pinball FX2 is the one to go for.

												Don't get me wrong as I'm a true pinball fanatic since my youth playing ""Pinball Dreams"", ""Pinball Fantasies"", ""Slamtilt"" and the like on my trusty Amiga ... BUT ... This very game here is no less than a total ripoff. It costs a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of money, if you wanna play all the tables AND the tables I've played so far in the free version (every month or so there is another free table - so don't waste your money on this - just play it for free!) have no real ball physics PLUS they are badly implemented as there are constant glitches like ""walls"" where the ball can roll through !!!!!If this was done right, it could easily be a mindblowing game as the idea to implement all the original tables we all know from our youth it is totally awesome. But sadly it's executed bad ...Avoid to pay for it and have some fun with the free tables.And if you wanna buy a decent pinball game then go for PinballFX2.Instead you could of course go to the arcade or just keep playing 21st Century's ""Slamtilt"" on your good old A1200 or WinUAE ... ;)The Silents (aka ""21st Century"") have outdone games like this 20 years before already ... You know what they say ... Only Amiga makes it possible ... :)... though I must say i really felt in love with PinballFX2 lately ...

												I loved playing this series on the PS4 and thought PC would improve the experience. Yikes! I'm stuck with a game that freezes on a regular basis. Nothing like being on a great roll, tripled the free game score on your first ball and you know you've already lined up at least three extra balls and you think this is the time I break the table - my score is going to be through the roof. As the third multi-ball madness winds down, without warning the game freezes. The table broke me and I never got to ball number 2. This is when the heartache went too far. The game freezes more often than not before I can go through three balls.			"

												Hi everyone, a little history then I'll move on.... Growing up, I had a huge interest in Computers and Video Games. However my true passion was always Pinball. My first computer was a commodore 64 which I got for Christmas of 1983. The first real game I purchased for the C64 was EA's Pinball Construction Set  PC Link Here [www.myabandonware.com].  It was simple as hell, but still you were able to create multiball games with it. About 10 years ago I was introducted to Visual Pinball which blew my mind, free pinball tables that can be created by everyone and anyone with an interest and started out banging tables I remembered creating in the 80's using PCS, then onto Future pinball and anything else that tried to recreate that feeling of real play.Fast forward to today and we have finally have TPA on the PC and nothing out there has yet to even come close to this;  I mean it may not be perfect (DX11), I can think of many things that should be added (Cabinet Mode.) However it has been a start to a near perfect Authenic Collection of pinball tables recreated for the PC.One addition I would love to see with TPA is side by side double player action with my steam friends, where each player plays on the left or right side of the screen, multi screen or even each player having its own window. I cannot see it taking up much bandwith and this would be excellent for tournaments and competition events. Are there any others who share this same type of interest. Here is a some Canadian Badass trivia. What do I have tattoo'd on my back?			"

Well that's been happening ever since this new update, sometimes the game just gives up and crashes. FarSight, fix this piece of crap.			"

												I previously had issues with Black Knight and they seem to be working on the ball lock issue. They upgraded the game with an optional DX11 version, but you can play it with DX9. If you have a DX11 video card, try the enhanced version.You can customise the DX11 lighting effects.You can buy seasons or individual tables. They occasionally have sales.The pinball tables are fun. I have almost 20 hours logged into it.There's one free table. There's a table of the month you can play as well. There are adds between games as well. "

												Have played more of this on Playstation than on Steam, but I am not the owner of that console so I had to pick them up when a good deal came around via Steam. Near-perfect, digital simulations of games from the distant to not-so-distant past that were much more reliant upon your interaction with their 3-dimensional, physical entertainment, is the reason why I nominated this nostalgic collection for the ""Test Of Time"" award.

												If you have ever been a fan of classic pinball games, ypu must try this. If you have even a passing interest in casual games, you need to try this. After playing every other pinball simulation out there, you must see how REAL pinball games were made and discover the depth of design that makes them classics. 'nuff said.			"

												I enjoy every game, I have purchased immensely!  It is fantastic, that I can get on the computer and play pinball.  I have been a pinball fanatic, practically all my life.  and it is a luxury to play pinball, from my home.  Especially when Pinball machines are not always available at the corner store.  Now!  Complaints!  I can not be believe I have played Adams Family for about 400 hrs and don't have 99 bear kicks!  I had 400 hours on this game in a Corner Store!

												I have over half of the table packs and as a gamer who is old enough to actually remember most of the tables from the arcade, I can say it is pretty faithful.But the pricing is out of whack, keep running specials on the $9.99 table packs and I will finish out the collection for ten bucks at a time all day long.$29.99 for a few tables is way too much.  I would never think of paying that. Not for a perfect rendition of any obsolete amusment. Nostalgia notwithstanding.The Interface for the menus was disappointing but only because for a brief time I would crash my computer every time I left the game. This doesn't happen anymore.It would be great if you coukld fix some oif the bugs in the old games, but by far this is the best version of pinball ever made that features the actual tables from the arcade so I have to give you props for that.

												Awesome game.For free you get a Pinball table and each month they rotate a free table to play as well.The free table they give you is pretty decent but the amount of tables there are to purchase can make it a bit confusing trying to figure out which ones will be the most fun- Each table has a trial but its too limited to really be able to see how 'good' it will be for you... First world problems, I know. =PI purchased 2 tables (bride of Pinbot and medieval madness) on a recomendation for like $4.99 for both and imho these tables were a steal. If I would have just tried these boards on the trial I wouldnt have bought them because the amount of time it takes to really see how the board works is much more than the trial gives you.So, I would recomend asking people who've played or watching some youtube videos before picking what to buy because it really can be confusing.As far as how good these tables are compared to  the originals they are based on- I have no idea. I've never played much pinball (real or virtual) so all i can comment on is the fun factor for me- Ive been playing with my wife (who isnt a gamer) and we've been having a blast- For under $5.00 we got 3 really good tables (theres sooooo much to do on each table that even just having a couple would not get boring) and the monthly table to try (which I dont like at all) and I'm very happy.Needs to have an easier way of setting up a verticle monitor because I'm lost at how to do that but other than that thois is fantastic.Will be making further purchases -			"

												Over all 8.5/10. The down side is the Pro packs...I would like to see more added camera features and ""Adult Mode"" Added to the none pro pack. I dont like that you have to spend a little more cash just to be able to access the tables features like Adult mode, sounds and lights. I own season 1 and 2 . Each season cost me 16$ when it was on sale 50% off during the winter sales and I have to say I really enjoy playing the tables that I used to see and play as a kid.One of the favorite tables has to be Terminator 2 which was great to finally play again. Then I showed my family the tables during the holidays and they all loved it.The physics of the flipper and ball are different from 3D FX but it feels more heavy and realistic.The devs seem like they are dedicated to bringing more tables and improving on the old tables so weekly or monthly updates are always instore.Cant wait to play Adams family table.

												All thanks to Farsight and the Pinball Arcade, I am starting to begin an interest in pinball. The graphics look very good and give such excellent details on each machine. The licensed machines are definitely the most appealing to pinball players and even classics from the likes of Xenon and F-14 Tomcat. It is a trip down memory lane for people playing pinball for years or even pro players and Farsight gives them a chance to play them on any format of consoles. I am looking forward to see more tables in the near future and play them greatly. I recommend this game to anyone. Of course there is some bugs that can be a bit of a downer for some but I am sure that Farsight will fix them soon enough. The one table I really love and is a favourite of mine is 'Judge Dredd' a complete gem of a game.			"

												Just wanted to post a review for this game as I feel it is undeserving of the Intense criticism it's recieving lately.This game has undergone some changes and people are not happy. I prefer to think positively about this, the new user interface is no way near as bad as some people are making out. It does have some issues yes, most definitely but I'm hopeful it will get worked on with time. What Farsight studios is doing is unprecedented, they have a lot of work on thier hands and I respect them for taking on a Mammoth challenge like this. If you love pinball, and I guess more importantly.. 'real' pinball, this game delivers a fantastic experience in simulating the real thing. And it's only going to get better with time, as physics improvements and more are planned. If you are a hardcore pinball fan, you may be disappointed with the amount of bugs in game which are extremely slow to be fixed, resulting in frustration for many.So my review concludes that the game is functional to a point, but if you can stand the long wait or deal with the possibility of some bugs never being addressed, it's a brilliant simulation that is only going to get better. It is currently my favourite game on the market, and I look forward to the years ahead and seeing what they will bring... adios.			"

												This game is being totally murdered by greed and inept marketing.While it manages - just about - to stand comparison with Pinball FX2 in terms of gameplay, the visible table size and viewing angles are poorer. What really kills this stone dead though, is the inability to purchase on a table-by-table basis. You have to pay for a multi-table 'Season pack' or forget it.Therefore, I recommend you forget it. A pity, as some of the all-time classic tables are in here. Sadly, a lot of the all-time dogs are too.			"

												What I like most about the game is that so far, it's the closest to a real pinball game and the graphics are really good. This game brings me back to my teenage days and I don't have to go an arcade to enjoy these classics. It works really well with my Xbox ONE Afterglow controller. I didn't have to configure anything. The best quality of this game is that it runs smooth as ice on my old Dell Optiplex 755. I almost forgot I was not on my NEW computer it runs so smooth with my 4GB RAM. The only suggestion I have at all is that if it is not already in the catalog, I would very much like for the developer to add Playboy. The sets don't seem complete with out it. On a scale of 1-10...I rate it as a 9. Please add more classic games. I feel like I'm at the arcade YAY!			"

												I recommend & don't recommend. Why? Simple. I bought a few tables from off the Mobile version. You cannot transfer them over to the PC version. That means you have to spend $5 each again on the tables you bought or $30 again for the seasons you purchase. So if you plan on playing this on your mobile app, do not bother with the PC/Steam version unless you have EXTREMELY deep pockets. Cause the prices on this game are highway robbery.HOWEVER, if you take advantage of Steam sales (like right now) you can afford the season packs. (most of them anyway.) Even if you have to reinstall Windows, the tables will always remain on your Steam account.Also fyi, if you change phones for any reason, you also lose your tables & have to rebuy your tables again. Which is completely unfair, terrible business practice.So if you're carrying the mobile version around, pay for tables you play often. Best advice I can give.Otherwise this has to be the best Pinball simulation I played to date. Beautiful graphics and sound. Just be wary that this is very very expensive.			"

												Avoid this version of Pinball Arcade. It is a straight port from iOS and is optimized horribly for the PC platform. The menus and interface are clearly made to work on a touch screen devices and doesn't feel right on a keyboard and mouse. Graphics could be improved, as well as the audio which sounds incredibly compressed. That being said, the tables and physics are outstanding, and the attention to detail in this area is really impressive. There are tons of tables to choose from, from many different eras and manufacturers. If you can look past the subpar optimization, definitely give it a try, but there are better platforms to play this game on.			"

												Pinball Arcade is something I can regularly come back to, and not only enjoy it as a video game, but bring back a lot of the feelings I would get playing real pinball tables.Everything outside that is bland as can be, but the tables are legit. They feel real. I can go between the ones in this and the ones at the Pinball Hall of Fame and not feel a discernable difference in gameplay.Some time ago, the user interface had a lot more personality. Previous stuff they did on consoles let you walk around a physical arcade to get to each machine. It's gotten more and more sparse in this incarnation, finally settling on what could only be called ultilitarian. It makes sense considering the growth of content, but it lacks ambience big style.For all its growing pains, it still satisfies the part of me that's really into pinball.			"

												This is the best pinball game available for professionals, amateurs and just casual couch play. It is outright pinball fun. If you love the game for any reason, this product is fantastic. Grab the free version and play the free content. There's a free table every month and a few free ones included permanently. Pricing is fair, however, as I mention later, the bundling structure leaves a little bit to be desired.While you cannot substitute the feel of the real machine, you can substitute the strategy involved in playing the games and learning the rules. For tournament players, I can't imagine anything better shy of having to purchase the real tables in order to practice setups. Since this game uses real emulation, all the rules apply as they do on the real tables, therefore developing habits in your gameplay here will translate into the final game. However, only general habits towards the rules of the game.I never got a chance to play Star Trek: TNG until recently at a Pizza Pub, after I had been playing it for a long time on Pinball Arcade. I was super stoked to find a real table of it. First game on the machine lasted 40 minutes, I scored 4.8billion points and ran through Final Frontier twice. The WHOLE time I was in control and my shots were planned ahead. On a table I'd never played...or did I? My normal first attempt at a new pinball game is flailing my elbows and knees until I slip and hit my chin on the corner and double drain.Do you transfer the real timing between the digital game and the real table? No. You do not. But did you also know that you don't transfer the timing between the real table and another real table? Some people may think if you return to a real table that you will have developed bad habits digitally or unwisely rely on makeable shots that aren't so much in the real world. This is all true, but real pinball players just know how the real thing is and this disconnect remains a soft barrier as we're not actually the kind of person who truly assumes the digital version WILL replace the real thing in every way. I can't wait until the mode in Pinball Arcade where you gotta scrape out a couple decade old hornet nets.Timings and tricks are different digitally, that's a certainty, but they're still there because the developers know of them and put them in. Separating yourself from this disconnect between reality and gaming is important in a product like this and if you're one of those people that can do this, you will enjoy this experience a high percentage of the amount you would the real table. If you're one of those people that ♥♥♥♥♥es that the movie sucks compared to the book, then you'll probably have the same knee-jerk reaction. If you really love pinball and you don't own real machines, you have no real other choice if you want to play the real games.There are some things I'm not fond of:One thing I cannot let go is a few tables have low enough resolution textures on the general playfield that the text is completely unreadable. ST:TNG is a good example of this when trying to read some of the Quadrant names on the ramp. This is double inexcusable because it isn't even on the playfield, which is a huge surface area requiring the polygons to be broken up all over the place to accommodate the lights and different patches of art. Unfortunately I'm talking about something the developers didn't appear to have thought about doing at all. Rather I think they just added one 2k material to the whole field. It's fuzzy. It's ugly. It's not acceptable for a real commercial product. Luckily, it holds up from a distance mostly, doesn't impede gameplay heavily, and only shows up on table exploration. I still believe this is a super simple thing to have gotten right in the first placem, having been a developer myself for a decade now.It's not all roses after that though, this is a fair review after all. Another thing I'm not too fond of is the game's current pricing structure. $5 a table is more than fair and never will be unfair, however, as a frugal gamer I like to look for bundle packages. This game offers several bundles in the form of pairs of tables, single tables or entire seasons. My gripe is that the seaons are broken apart based upon when the tables were added to Pinball Arcade, not when that table design was released to the public, by theme or any other factor. Farsight's release schedule making any kind of impact on which tables I can bundle together is a lazy move, if not just stubborn, pointless and irritating. $5 a table and $40 for 15-20 is a good deal. However, I didn't pay that for any season other than season 1, because it had the majority of the real tables I was familiar with. I made the decision based on the ratio of tables I knew and wanted to play again. There's at least 10 other tables in the game I played in the arcades and want to purchase, but I'm not buying all the seasons and I'm not paying $5 each too often. I'm not buying anything more than one table every 3 months until I can pay $40 and choose my own 20 tables my own damn self. Stubborn, I know. I get the seaons thing, I do. It's cute and I'm glad you guys can share in that in the Farsight Offices. We the people could give a $h!t. You're forcing me to buy stuff I don't want to buy in order to buy stuff I do want to buy. This is somewhat standard in the rest of the world, but making me buy 8 things I don't want to get the 2 I do is a ratio I'm not downs with. You can't guess which ones I want. So why are you making an assumption? Kill the seasons and put a personazable bundle system together within the game itself that ties to your website.I buy directly from within the game in hopes you don't lose a cut to steam.Pros:40,000% savings over a real pinball machine per tableAccurate visual representation of the real playfieldsReal board emulation. If it broke here, it broke there tooGreat Lighting and rendering. Glass is clean and metals shineGood performance, quick loadingFairly fun activities in the form of challenges and goalsNo table maintenanceQUICK TO RESTART A GAME!!!Cons:Not the real thingSlightly unstable physics under stress (balls pass through rarely)Some tables have buggy camerasSome tables have low resolution playfield texturesNo global tournament settingsUnflexible bundle offersNo table maintenance			"

It reminds me of the old Nintendo GUIs when they first started making video games (sorry nintendo), I am glad that they decided to change this before I made the purchase. I would suggest to whoever wrote this horrible code that they allow the users to select which GUI they want to use. Classic or New and improved. Until this happens, I would recommend against purchasing any of these pinball games. It's really a shame to ruin a good product with bad packaging.			"

												Some tables play smoother than others, but there was an incredible amount of work put into this game and the tables. I'm editing my review because I originally moaned about the prices, and unfairly so. I realize now that you can get the same or more hours out of a pinball table that you love as you can get from any other kind of game you might buy. Say you buy a season for $30 and like two of the tables enough to play them regularly, you easily got the same entertainment value as you would have gotten from buying a couple other individual games. And you never FINISH a pinball table. You can just keep going back and getting better... I enjoy the ""other"" pinball simulator on steam, too, but being based on real tables makes this one win easily. HIGHLY recommended!			"

												This game is deceptively labeled as ""free"" in the steam store.  It's not free unless your idea of fun is playing a few minutes of each game and then stopping.   I guess everyone has access to at least one pinball table for free, but ""Arabian Nights"" isn't my favorite table really, so I can't imagine anyone just playing that table over and over.Still, it's got a great collection of real simulated pinball tables with some classics going back to the earliest days of pinball to more modern releases that you might remember from 20 years ago.  (Do they still make pinball tables? It has been so long since I've been out to an arcade or even a bar that would have one to know)Anyway, some particularly good pinball tables to mention:  Star Trek:TNG, Black Knight 2000, Terminator, Elvira and the party monsters, Creature from the Black Lagoon, No Good Gofers, Funhouse, and Champion Pub.  Some of these I remember playing the actual table and it does a good job of bringing back the feeling of playing (minus the loss of quarters from my pockets) and others I discovered from playing them in this collection.There are table packs, and ""seasons"" you can buy into, and even in the seasons you can choose the regular or the ""pro"" version.  It's obvious why you'd want to buy the seasons instead of the individual tables (you save some cash) but why would you want the pro version?  Supposedly there's a few tables with some not-so-nice words that are spoken, and the pro versions allow you to unlock this (I heard, but could be wrong) and the pro version allows you to mess with the table mechanics more and ""cheat"".  While it might be nice to have the pro version, it's not a necessity.  At the time of this writing they are just beginning season 4.  I've got all of them up to the end of season 3, and I will probably eventually get season 4.  If you're a fan of real pinball machines, check this out.  If you're a fan of old pinball machines or rare pinball machines, check this out.    I won't go so far as to say that every pinball game included is equally fun, but there are some real gems and classics in there.			"

												The initial VERY long delay for the game's PC release (and also DX 11 update later) put aside: The Pinball Arcade is in my opinion a dream come true for everyone who enjoys playing pinball casually to semi-professionally.As the developer advertises, this is not just a collection of virtual pinball tables, but an accurate simulation of real tables, making TPA also a project of history preservation, as most of these tables are not produced anymore and fewer of them exist with every passing year.TPA does of course not replace the real table experience, but the simulation is getting very close to it: every surface is scanned, every part recreated as a 3D model and every software of a table is emulated (including sounds, displays, ect.). Classic and licensed tables from all the big pinball companies can be found here, including Williams, Stern, Midway and Bally.The developer keeps improving the game's physics and the interface is planned to improve in the future too.Tales of the Arabian Nights is always available for free and every other table can also be tested for free until players reach a certain score. There's also always another free table available each month. You can compete with your scores in a global ranking or a seperate ranking just with the people on your friends list.If you are new to the game or pinball tables in general: download the demo, play a few games of Tales of the Arabian Nights and test all the other tables. If you are unsure which season pack you should buy, my advice would be to start with season 1, which is still the most solid mix in my opinion.			"

												I stream pinball on twitch and thus far Pinball Arcade is not only the best because it features greatest hit games from the past, but moreover that they have truly mastered the quirks and physics of the actual machines themselves in a digital form. I can't say enough good stuff about this series. $40 may seem steep pricewise for a season, but if you truly play alot the savings is immediatly evident as pinball standups cost between 1 and 2 dollars per play now. So yeah, if you are into pinball, this franchise cannot be missed in my opinion.			"

												Pinball. I have most tables and always come back to play them often. There is no game that can offer the replay value of pinball. 5$ for each table, sometimes they are 2 packs, and season passes offering a discount. You can spend well over 5$ in an hour or so playing real pinball, and to pay 5$ to always have a table on demand is awesome. If you like pinball you will like this game. They make new tables all the time too.			"

												Absolutely amazing pinball simulator. Gorgeous tables, amazing art direction and physics. The closest thing to being there.The sheer number of tables is pretty cool, and each pack offers a lot of classic tables. Sure, the UI could use a little refreshing, but when it comes to the actual ways the tables play, they're great.			"

												I got this game just to purchase the Fish Tales table.  It was totally worth it.  Near perfect emulation of the physical game.  All the strange bounces and quirks happen on this game just the way they did on the real thing.  Spinner (monster fish, stretch the truth) is a little harder than IRL, but extra ball and caster's club are easier than physical machines.  I've probably played over 100 hours of Fish Tales on physical machines, and playing the table in Pinball Arcade is 99% as good as the real thing. Plus you can ""open the cabinet"" and set the game up for 10 ball games with tons of EB opportunities.  Finally get that super-jackpot on one of the most difficult pins of all time.The ony gripe I have about this game is the terrible interface before you actually start playing your tables.  My one wish for this game is that it had a user configurable camera.  I want it fixed, almost directly overhead.  AND I want to be able to play this rotated 90 degrees on a vertical monitor!!!			"

												As a pinball enthusiast, this game is satisfying.I've purchased a few select tables (Theatre of Magic, Black Hole, Ripley's Believe it or Not) and have really enjoyed them. They do an excellent job simulating the sights/sounds that you remembered from these wonderful machines.The physics feel very real, but there will never be quirks that develop as these simulators will never show wear and tear.I've trial-played most of the tables, and the one I'm very disappointed in is the White Water. This is an excellent game in person (continue to play) with a much nicer tri-color backlight display and the sound effects of this simulation game are atrocious. Overall though, this has been an excellent and fun experience. I've showed my kids that this is really fun stuff and even cooler in person! (albeit more difficult for sure)A++ guys; keep the tables coming! I've also heard that you'll be teaming up with Stern (maybe Jersey Jack) to co-release new tables with their simulators??? That's the ticket! Get this younger generation to realize the magic and fun of playing these universes of wonder on the 2D screens, and then the real-life version will be that much better.			"

												Pinball Arcade brings back the classic tables from the old days. Yes you will have to pay for the tables. But when you figure how much you will play them, you can easily get your money back in play time. it is also easy it is to nudge the tables and not tilt the game. The titles are often the ones you would have seen in the bars. The graphics are very real looking as well as the sounds following the original arcade machine it was modeled after. With Steams enhancements it is easy to now have friends join you from home. Come on over, sit down, and pull out the joystick. Grab coffee, biscuit and headphones and let the fun begin. Just remember to stop and deal with the real world after awhile of playing. Life still goes on outside of the game.			"

												Finally! Games I can remember from my childhood! And before you mock me, yes, the arcade scene was still pretty big in the 90s, and I can recall a good portion of these pinball machines in various truck-stops across America, whether just off to the side or in dedicated arcade rooms to provide some cheap entertainment that wasn't in the trucker's lounge. Either way, what does this game offer, for both the good and the bad?Let's just say that if you can't ever find the machine you remember playing, there's a good chance that it's here or will be here (for a price, of course). I'm rather shocked that a little company in the mountains of California could get licenses to use these titles and attempt to replicate them... And by replicating them, I mean going out of the way to get every sound, detail, and bumper as accurate to the real thing as possible. PROS Lots of tables with more to come, it seems. So far they've got tables from the 60s up to the 2000s. These include tables of licensed franchises (Rescue 911, Twilight Zone, etc.) as well the originals like Pin-Bot. Generally smooth game play. While I personally haven't ran into any major bugs (thus I can't speak for everyone), overall most of the tables play quite smoothly and feel as close to the real thing as you can get with a virtual pinball machine. Note that I'm playing this from a PC as opposed to a device or a VR setup. Try before you buy. If you want to get a feel for a specific table, you are able to play a trial version of it with a high-score limit to see if you like it... In which you can play it as many times as you want before you buy it. CONS Pricey. Oh yes, and it's perhaps my only true complaint about the game. If it weren't for the fact that I can try out any table for free as much as want, I probably wouldn't have given this game a shot. A single table costs about $5, with table packs being about $30 (or $40 for pro packs). Of course, I can understand why the prices are like this; licensing fees are probably pretty expensive, especially for tables who are already using licensed franchises like Harley Davidson or Doctor Who, and Far Sight needs to make their money somehow given all the work put into the game. It's a bit harsh on the consumer, but the reasoning makes sense. The great device mix-up. While I don't plan on playing pinball games on my crappy phone, if you do plan to use other devices, be ready for the fact that the game won't be able to sync data between devices, meaning you have to repurchase the tables again for that device. I think this may be more about the company being as small as it is and not having all their resources and ducks lined up right to help the consumer out. It personally doesn't affect me, but may affect you.MEH It's not the real thing. Duh. You won't get the exact physics of the real machines in a virtual machine. But if you can't find the real table in your area, this is a great alternative. Apollo 13 isn't here yet. 13-ball multi-ball is quite chaotic and fun, I tell you.OVERALLHonestly I haven't spent much time in it nor invested money into it yet, but if sales come around or I do run into a heap of cash, I plan on buying some tables. Despite the steep cost, if you're looking for pinball machines you remember but can't find those actual machines (let alone, an actual arcade), then this game is for you. If your a real pinball wizard and look to show others who's boss by flipping the score tables around the world on Diner or Arabian Knights, than this game is for you. If you're someone, however, looking for a bargain buy with a lot of substance... Well, this game has the substance, but not the bargain. "

												This is a great pinball sim. It has good physics and a bonus are all the historical (and new) tables. That adds a nostalgia factor, because I remember playing some of those machines when I was a teen. Also they have 2 of my favourite tables: ST TNG and Haunted House.If you like pinball, get this game. The tables are more expensive than in Pinball FX 2, but I guess the licenses for Stern et al. are more expensive. Also (for even more money) one can acquire pro versions, with tips and the option to explore tables in detail.			"

												This is a comment regarding the Macintosh port only.Graphically, it doesn't look anywhere like the PC version. It still manages to run randomly like a dog - framerate dipping randomly and slowing the whole game speed every so often -, a bug that has been documented and commented since the launch for almost 2 years now.Finally, a port wouldn't be a real lazy crappy port if it had control configuration. Happily(?), you cannot configure the controls on the Macintosh version, but the FAQ updated in December of 2013 tells us it is the dev's priority to implement such a basic and necessary feature.

												The most expensive free game ever.Once you download all 3.5GB of this game, you are immediately presented with text telling you how awesome this game is (?) and then you are asked to purchase minimum of one (1.) pinball table for a small sum of 5 euroes. Of course, you can get a package that saves you TON OF MONEY, by paying about 25 euroes and receiving 10 tables.If you do not pay, you can play effectively for about 5 minutes of time since there is a highscore cap you can reach before the game boots you out, but hey, you are able to repeat this countless of times!You cannot save your highscore since you haven't payed, but there is one (1.) free table you can play.There are aparently some other free tables, which you have to find in the sea of pay to play ones, but I managed it. After I found one free table, it also asked me to purchase it. Bug or feature, I have no idea.The game itself is not that bad, graphics and gameplay are both decent. Camera is a bit tricky on some tables because it automatically follows the ball to certain edge of the table, making it really awkward to use the flippers as the ball comes back. Controls are quite simple and easy to use, although they are not what I would assume them to be.Overall:If you are not a pinball fanatic who has mountains of cash to burn, I recommend avoiding this game.EDIT1 - For the developers:The game is pretty bad with its current system, however, it has potential. Here are some of things I believe should be done in order to sell the game better and make it more successful:1. Remove the message on start up. No one likes a self brag.2. Cut the game and sell it. The game doesn't really need 3.5GB to operate, when a person that downloads it uses only 1 table. Also, why is this game free? It obviously is made with the intention to sell and that is alright. Put the price on the game, 5eur. Comes with 5 tables, Nothing else. Make DLC's containing 10 tables each that would upgrade to the game and sell them at whatever price you wish.3. Release a Demo. Allow players to download a free demo, containing only 1 free table - how it comes now.4. Do not bug the players to purchase ingame. It is offsetting. A simple ""For more tables check out our DLC packages on Steam!"" would do.5. Once all of the above has been done, promote. Give out a few cheap/free copies via bundles for example.Good luck.			"

												Sorry for the lack of focus of the review, just writing this up as I go.Pinball has always been part of our gaming culture. It's technically the grandfather of all modern video games, mechanical pinball was the first arcade game. They've been around longer then any video arcade game. They're an important part of not just gaming culture, but the entertainment industry, right up there with any other fine art. And if you think about it, the amazing effort put into every specific machine is extraordinary. Just imagine putting all those little gears and lights and gizmos together, so someone can slap some flippers around to get a high score.Anyways, enough about my praise of the pinball machine and onto the review. Farsight has done an excellent job recreating over 40 pinball tables (to date) and releasing them in virtual form. There has been other attempts at true 3d virtual pinball recreations, mostly those PS2 games, but the amount of tables to choose from was small, and the graphics, quite poor. They were poor representations of the tables. Now, why should the casual game be interested in this? Because simply put, the pinball experience is something unique to it. If you have not already tried a pinball table before, a *REAL* one, not something like Pinball FX, then you should defintely download the demo and try out the free table of the week. It's a real treat to see everything about the IRL machine recreated in minute detail. The lights the ramps the targets the animitronics, the dialogue, the dot matrix displays, and the charm of even the older mechanical machines are all recreated virtually.Like I've said, you've got over 40 tables to choose from, with another 20 tables planned for release in 2014. Let me go over how the game isn't really free to play, but more like an actual paid game. You can buy individual tables for 4.99 each. Some of the tables are surely worth it, you've got legendary classics like Medieval Madness, Terminator 2, and quirky and rare tables like Cactus Canyon, and Going Nuts. You've got tables from all eras, old electro mechanical pins like Genie, and some of the more early released 1980s efforts by Balley like Black Knight and Class of 1812, both of which I highly reccomend, picking them up via the season 1 pack. The season packs cost 29.99 and come with 20 tables each. You're only paying for a few dollars per table, but if you want you can pick up individual tables of the more popular ones like T2 and Medieval Madness for 5 dollars each. I do not reccomend picking up the Pro pack, for 2 extra dollars you get a small change to the ini file and the option to access to the operator menu. Which also invalidates your score.Comparsions to Pinball FX2 can and will be made. Pinball FX is notably cheaper.. you can get Humble Bundle keys which contain 2/3 of the tables for a dollar. But a majority of the tables are Marvel liscenced virtual pins made only for the game. And a lot of them don't have very fun goals. Take a look at Farsights virtual repesentation of Funhouse on Pinball Arcade, which came out in 1990, side by side with Zen Studio's newest lisceneced table from Marvel, Dr. Strange and you'll see the difference. Funhouse is 20 years older and 20 times more fun. This is because the table's featured in Pinball Arcade are much better designed, have more satisfying rewards, and have a snappier pace.Virtual pinball in itself is a niche, but a niche defintely worth trying out. It's actually quite accessable, unlike most games that are niche - rougelikes for example. I would reccomend anyone with a passing interest to try out the game (Dont think its free to play, its defintely not, but they provide one fully functional table every month.) If you've played a pinball machine in your life, and you enjoyed it, download this game and give it a try. "

												First, let me get this out of the way: NOTHING, EVER, in the computer gaming world will EVER be exactly like a real life analog pinball machine. There is no way to 100% digitize the analog workings of pinball games, EVER.With that said, this game gives us a very good digital representation of the real life tables. It's not perfect, but it's very close. It's close enough that I don't even notice the difference. There are probably some minor glitches but I haven't personally noticed them. The tables can be expensive though, at $5 per table, or buy the table packs to save some money. You DO, however, get a free table, which to me is still one of my favorite tables to play: The Tales of the Arabian Nights. The tables are a little pricey to purchase, but I understand there are licensing fees I'm sure they're paying, plus the work that goes into each individual table, so I don't complain THAT much about it.One thing I do like is, before you buy a table, you can play any of the tables you like for free, to see if you will even like that table or not. You just can't play for a high score, but you can see if you will even like the table so you don't have to buy the table blindly. Another thing that's great here is that for each table, there is a menu option that explains in detail how that particular machine works, what the objectives are, and how to score maximum points on it. It helps to know what you are trying to do on each table, and they outline each objective very well.I do wish the interface while selecting a table was a little bit better, but it's a minor complaint, as I don't play this game for the interface. All in all, I definitely like this one, and suggest you give it a try. It's great to play some of my favorite real life tables: Whirlwind, Tales of the Arabian Nights, The Addams Family, Star Trek, etc and have it look and feel a lot like the real thing. I feel like they spent a lot of time on each table to get it to act just like the real life analog tables, or as close as possible. Just be prepared to spend some money if you want to have a high score on your favorite tables.			"

The physics are decent and acceptable for a pinball simulator; it is impossible to fully recreate the real physics and wear and tear that are in some of these real games.

												I've had tons of fun with Pinball Arcade (I own Pinball Hall of Fame on Wii, then Xbox 360, and now Pinball Arcade on PS4 & PC). These tables are recreated with a great amount of detail. It's not quite as good as reality, of course, but this is the best we have. There are so many nostalgic sounds and sights. These tables can give you hundreds of hours of fun!The cost of all the DLC packs really add up, if you care to collect them all, but this game is absolutely unique.Note, Pinball Arcade are based on real world tables. There is no fantasy element. Pinball FX2 exists for fake pinball tables, and there isn't really any Kirby/Pokemon/Sonic-style fantasy pinball game anymore (WizOrb is Arkanoid style but similar). "

Some tables glitch; Star Trek goes into a ball-hogging oblivion leaving you wtih an unplayable table. The UI makes another unwelcomed return with hi-scores, sometimes acknowledging the input key for Select, other times requiring the mouse. Another UI bug exists with (0,0)xy for the mouse at every new screen rather than recalling coords over appropriate targets like Select or Start.Overall I'm impressed and will be enjoying these tables for some time.

The only serious negative is being unable to change table resolution.

												They changed the interface of the whole game making it harder to find the tables you own and can play. A minor nuisance. Overall the new interface didn't make the selection clearer.Escape key used to work under every circumstance in the game but now esc will call up the menu from the Pinball screen but doesn't respond when back in the main menu. You now have to click the off button to get the exit menu.The update has some bugs and the odd time I get a blue debug screen with an out of memory error. My machine has 6Gb in it but the game itself is still 32 bit. Perhaps there is the problem.A few tables have lost the ball and no amount of checking or calling the attendant will free the ball. Only way out, restart the game.That was the bad. Now the good. If you loved playing pinball, these classic tables are as authentic a game play as you'd get on a real pinball machine and are certainly enjoyable.			"

												Single-handedly reinvigorated my love of pinball.  I used to play a whole bunch of these tables when arcades were still a thing.  Yes, I'm old.  Shut up. I know some people complain that it's not the same thing, and I agree.  It's never going to be an exact 100% recreation.  It's never going to be like plunking a quarter into Whirlwind.  You know what?   I'm fine with that because it's a damn good representation.  If nothing else, having things like the instructions really has upped my game.  When I play IRL pinball, I'm way better.  One problem might be the price, for some people.  Pinball Arcade is not cheap.  I started playing it on my PS3, bought three seasons and then realized I'd have to re-buy the same tables when I migrated to Steam.  Thank god for sales.  I can't particularly complain because the people who make these tables are talented, but it could be a sticking point for some.  If you like pinball, though, it's a must buy.			"

												I have been a big pinball fan ever since I was a kid.  My uncle had a few when I was growing up and I fell in love.  One of my favorites he had was ""Twilight Zone"".  When I was a kid I had no idea that it was related to a TV show (now one of my all-time favorites)  but I just loved the table so much.  The catchy music, the out of this world sfx, and the really interesting table design.  The way this game works is each table is $4.99.  You can purchase the whole season but honestly the best idea IMO is just to purchase the ones you want.  I bought ""Twilight Zone"" and for now I am more than content :)  Oh, you also get ""Tales of Arabian Nights"" absolutely free!  I had never palyed the table in real life before but I really like it as well!			"

												At first I was scepticle...a computer, taking place of my actual machine...purposterous,...unimaginable...unthinkable.......but...then I took the chance... and oh my god (or whomever you pray too) this application knocked my socks off.  The intial table was challengind yes, but as I played more of the demos I realized that these guys were serious with their recreations.  I can honestly say they replicate faithful replications of the actual machines.   An exampled for you is Williams Cyclone (at this time the most recent replication), this game plays exactly as my personal machine plays (right to the bone).  I am not won over easy my friends, it takes a little something to convince me, they succeeded, hence why I own evey table they have put out this far.  I am going to tell you don't make a mistake, don't pass this one up, while it may be pricey, it is just, the system on Steam is perfect.  Don't waste your time looking for clones, the guys do it right. Well what the heck are you waiting for, get to playing a pin.  I hope to see you in game on the Tournament mode when it is release.  Happy playing!!!!			"

												First, I want to address the things that other people have issues with. First of all, I quite like the new UI update, not just because of how it looks, but also because TPA has so many tables now, and on the old UI, it took forever to scroll through them. The new UI streamlines things a bit, letting you choose your table from a huge grid, and tends to be more responsive than the old UI did. My only real gripe with the new UI is that it's also a little bit glitchy, especially when you use a controller. This is most notable when you're entering high scores - you can choose your letter alright, but you gotta click it with your mouse to enter it, since the button fails to enter it now. And this is the sort of game that I would prefer to use a controller for anyway, hence why I still play this game on my PS4 a lot, but that has the old UI still, making navigating very troublesome for me. Patch please!The other big issue that other people have with this is cost. A lot of people complain about how expensive the tables are. True enough, but these same people don't even seem to spare a thought for the programmers who went through the solid efforts to bring those tables to us. It must have been so hard for them to do all the research, and give you EVERYTHING the table had in real life. To say nothing of the painstaking physics engine that the game had from the ground up, which they gave to us for free, I might add. Considering all this, I strongly believe the prices are reasonable.In closing, TPA, while superb in its simulations, still doesn't quite beat playing a real pinny, and given how video game programming can only go so far (at least for now), that is unlikely to change. However, I would strongly recommend TPA because they are still the best simulations of real-life pinnies you could ever ask for.			"

												They changed the interface of the whole game making it harder to find the tables you own and can play. A minor nuisance. Overall the new interface didn't make the selection clearer.Escape key used to work under every circumstance in the game but now esc will call up the menu from the Pinball screen but doesn't respond when back in the main menu. You now have to click the off button to get the exit menu.The update has some bugs and the odd time I get a blue debug screen with an out of memory error. My machine has 6Gb in it but the game itself is still 32 bit. Perhaps there is the problem.A few tables have lost the ball and no amount of checking or calling the attendant will free the ball. Only way out, restart the game.That was the bad. Now the good. If you loved playing pinball, these classic tables are as authentic a game play as you'd get on a real pinball machine and are certainly enjoyable.			"

												To put it simply, this game is *the* game to own if you like pinball.For a start, there are more than 50 tables (and counting) available, with one - Tales of the Arabian Nights - free to start you off. The tables are hugely varied and are sure to include something that appeals. A generous demo system means you can try tables before you buy and solid DLC systems mean you can buy the ones you like either in basic sets or ""season packs"".The physics are as good as anyone has ever managed for pinball on PC. For such a complicated (and on-going) emulation, the bugs are relatively few and far between - there certainly are some, but the game is updated regularly and the tech support team seem friendly and quick to respond to issues.Regular tournaments, table releases and ongoing leaderboards mean there is plenty to keep you coming back, and while not all the tables are solid gold classics, many of the best tables from the history of pinball can be found here from EMs like Central Park and Big Shot to later, deluxe tables like Attack from Mars and The Twilight Zone.This game gets a warm reccomendation and, if you like pinball - especially real life pinball - then it's simply an essential purchase.

												First of all, I used to own some of the pinball tables and I played my fair share of the classic ones.It looks great but the controls are sluggish and makes it absolutely unrealistic. There is a delay between the moment you click on a button and the moment the flipper activates. In a well maintained table, the action is instantaneous. Maybe with a lot of patience and practice, I could get used to the lag but I am very disappointed in this simulation. It feels like playing on a pinball which has a power circuit about to break down.I really wanted to like this game since after moving to a new place I had to get rid of my pinballs but unfortunately, I will have to wait for something better.

												HOLY. COW.I've always enjoyed pinball games. Unfortunately, given the fact I live in a very rural area I've always had to make do with video game pinball tables, only having played real physical units a time or three. Despite that the history and design of the real tables have always fascinated me, and I've longed for a way I could experience some of the real classics.Well, here's the answer.In terms of production values as a video game Pinball Arcade is a little lacking in some areas. Overall visual fidelity isn't the greatest given the simplicity of its subject matter, and in all honesty the presentation of the game's menus isn't the most user friendly, with a strangely syrupy-feeling lag between menu selection inputs and their taking effect on-screen. In-game, though, things are completely different, with tight controls and a solidly reliable camera that makes actually playing the tables themselves a joy. Perhaps its simply my inexperience, but the physics of the tables do, at times, feel a bit on the floaty side, however.What really takes the cake in the game's presentation, at least for me, are the snippets of table background available when you launch each table. For players just looking to play some pinball these might seem like a bit of an annoyance, but for those who appreciate the history of the industry, or the history of games in general, these blurbs are fascinating and offer insight into the development of pinball games as a whole.The visual issues and physics mentioned above are nitpicky issues, but part of what makes them stand out is the price of the overall package. At thirty dollars or more a pop for each ""season,"" or five dollars a piece to buy tables individually, the tables in Pinball Arcade feel like they come at a stomach-churning premium, especially when compared to its competitors. Doubtless the premium is partially due to licensing costs for the various tables from their original producers, but when alternatives like Pinball FX offer cheaper tables with arguably (from a video game perspective) more complex gameplay and higher production values, it can be hard to justify to oneself the pricing here. That said, there's something to be said for featuring ""real"" tables as opposed to completely unrealistic fantasy models, and when the content of each season is taken into account the price discrepancy isn't as great as it at first seems, since each season consists of 10 or more unique tables, meaning tables average out to about 3 dollars a pop if the basic version of each season is purchased, less for the Season 1 tables since there are 14 of them.If you're a pinball aficionado, Pinball Arcade is definitely the game to look at, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates more about game design than just the latest graphics engine and online shooting. The tables play nicely, and the extras make for a unique, well-valued package. If, on the other hand, you're turned off by the idea of solid-state hardware and often incredibly dated table aesthetics, then look elsewhere.			"

												Post-June update: The new GUI is crap. A lot of people are pointing that out. But, what I am noticing is the play of the games has changed. The gravity simulation feels different. The nudging does not have the same bump action pre-update. And the tables are glitching a lot more. I always play on DX11 on a PC.Gorgar for instance. I can shoot the plunger, set the ball down the C lane, and it center drains 60% of the time. Flippers that used to seem strong now react spongy, like there is dirt gumming up the flipper post. Also, sometimes the rubbers on the playfield spring like you would expect, other times they are dead like they are actual dried out rubber that need to be replaced. Also, the scoreboard graphic that is in the upper left corner is unreadable. The score sits behind the ball counter graphic.Flight 2000, Firepower, Black Knight, Centaur and even Star Trek: The Next Generation all have similar issues. I do not know if the game mechanics have been tweaked, or if the gravity engine has changed but, something is different and it is very frustrating. I personally own a Haunted House and a Terminator 2. I have restored them and play them on an almost daily basis. I know the angles and the shots. The reason why I have bought all five pro-packs for me and my Son was because of how realistic the play was on this simulator. Also, finding any of these machines in this game in working order where we can play for hours is hard to come by. We started playing this game on the PS3 and it was because you are modelling all of these old classic pins that now, as time goes on, if you want to buy one, it costs thousands of dollars to get one. When we saw it was on Steam, we did not hesitate to purchase every season again, and in duplicate. The play on the PS3 was very poor sometimes but, we love pinball.I do recommend this game but, something has changed since the patch. And it needs to be fixed. If you are looking to buy this for the first time, maybe hold off until all the bugs have been chased out of the outlanes.			"

												I was very impressed with this title. The recreation of some of the more popular and fondly remembered pinball machines is very accurately done. Every sound, graphic and animation you remember has been faithfully reproduced.In short, it's everything you want a pinball game to be!Now for the negative; The menu graphics and fonts are large and clunky, and in general not very visually appealing, and changing graphic settings can only be done outside of the game, but both of these aspects can be largely ignored.The main downfall of this game is however, is pricing. While, for a pinball game, it hits all of the right sweet spots, to be able to play more than just one table, you need to spend a heck of a lot.To buy Season One (to essentially convert your ""Demo"" into a full game), it costs almost twice the price of Skyrim! Which is just not on.Do I recommend this title? Everything in me wants so desperately to say yes, as it's probably one of the nicest pinball games I've had the pleasure of playing, but I'm afraid this gets a no from me. Simply for the fact that I can't justify the pricing. I would have loved to play more of it otherwise.I'll be happy to change this review and recommend this title if the pricing is ever fixed. But until then, steer clear.			"

												......after reading some of the negative reviews about this game, I would like to say that growing up in an era both before and through the videogame era, I spent thousands of hours playing Pinball in the smoke filled, dark and LOUD  Surfers Paradise ""Pinball Alleys"". This was even before Grundy's existed and I can surely say this game will take you back to that time and era of misspent hours. These games are EXACTLY the same as the machines back then. You even get to play from the simple 'rollover digit' machines, through the 'LED digit' era all the way to the 'all the ramps, video screen minigame, multiball era. I can say I have played all but a handful of these machines in real life, so if you want a game that will give you that ""take you back"" feeling and you are as old as I am, then this is a game for you...... even despite any small nuances..............

												The PC version is the best TPA for sounds and table art.The console versions sound is crappy most notible is High-Speed my PS4 versions when it does the bonus after just a short while the sound for the bonus just ends and it goes silent.With the PC version it is more true to the real thing.I should know I own High-Speed here.The Pros: Great visuals and sound.Play the tables on here then look for them out in the wild!The Cons: Nothing beats the real thing you do not get the feel of the table and the mechs working and the feel of the ball while it zips around.Ball is pretty much glued to the playfield. No ball hopping like in a real machine which I love!And I noticed unlike the console versions the PC version only has the Season Packs for sale and not individual which is a bummer.			"

												Simply the best pinball sim I've played. Finally a game that let's you play the REAL classic tables, faithfully recreated in high quality. I don't like that they only offer one table ""free 2 play"", but at least it is a great one (Tales of the Arabian Nights).Every table comes with a short overview of its history and you can check out the original advertisement flyer and the detailed ruleset in the table menu. There's custom balls to get, the pro versions of the tables let you even tinker around with the operator menus. The tables are pricey, but they're totally worth it. You can try each one as often as you like until you hit a certain score, finding tables that you like to buy. Pinball lovers should go for this.			"

												So, Emulation wise this is the best thing you can get. These people put real effort into every little detail, and within limitation of simulation they go for the best results. You should really get this if you are in any way a pinball fan, or try out arabian nights until you hit a 50million score or higher (you are addicted to pinball by then).For the bad part, the UI is clunky as all hell. I had the Williams collection on Xbox, which worked really well, and instead of table menus it had table selection in some sort of arcade hall setting, which was nice. But this UI is just a pain. Many bugs, many odd behaviours. Poor button design in general. They can really use a good overhaul on that menu to not scare away newcommers. Please do not underestimate this fact developer!			"

												I love this game. The tables are very detailed and fun to play. The new interface is indeed a bit confusing, but I think it helps you to find your favourite tables faster, if you got a lot of it. You can e.g. sort by your own rating, A-Z or goals you already  reached. My main con ist that the seasons are very expensive. You may say approx 30 Euros for 10 tables - that's 3 Euro each and the devs want to earn money to live. O.K.. But why not make single tables for 3 or 2.5 each? I'd rather spent some money now and then on a few tables I pick myself, than 30 Euros on 10 which of 5 are not that enjoyable...			"

												My biggest issue is the price of the tables. I think the ""first two seasons"" have the best value because it gets you the most tables per cost, but the later seasons where you get 10 tables for 30 dollars is pretty steep for a game like this. That being said, I do like the mechanics, it is most ""true to life"" pinball available IMO. However, the biggest issue I run into actually playing the tables is their is little to no ""inperfections"" on the board. So balls will always ""roll"" perfectly and smoothly across. Which makes the game good and bad. Bad in a sense, that when you play the same table IRL and then on the game you could have a wildly different experience, but good, in that you can get a lot of practice on tables and know how you should approach games when you play them in tournaments or at the arcades. I know some people don't like the UI. I can relate, but to me it's fine. The historical low on DLC has been 14.99 a pack, two months ago they were on sale for around 20 a pack. Which is where I think the price of these should be. I would wait for a sale and get a ""Season or two"" of Pinball arcade and it gets a lot funner IMO. I personally wouldn't waste time getting the pro tables unless you really need options like turning off Extra ball (like they do in pro pinball events.) Otherwise you'll just want to play the games ""stock."" Overall, I do recommend this game. It's the only option on the market that has real life pinball table emulated as well as they could be.			"

												Though I'm ultimately recommending the game, I'll start with the bad: It's buggy as hell. I've had the camera get locked in to an odd position that obstructed my view of the ball once, I have had several crashes due to alt-tabbing (please manage your memory better, devs), and two instances in which it froze before my game was complete. Oh, and as everyone else mentions, the UI is atrocious. To circumvent another bug, if you're accidently selecting a different game than what you've clicked your cursor on, then move the arrow buttons to move the dumb little blue selector box to the game you want. I get the feeling that many of these bugs are due to the fact that this is a pretty low quality pc port, and that the primary focus is on consoles. A pity.But the good far outweighs these issues: the tables are fun to play, accurate to their real life counterparts, and the ball physics feel great. It's nice to practice on specific tables so that I do better when I head down to the pinball arcade by my work.			"

												......after reading some of the negative reviews about this game, I would like to say that growing up in an era both before and through the videogame era, I spent thousands of hours playing Pinball in the smoke filled, dark and LOUD  Surfers Paradise ""Pinball Alleys"". This was even before Grundy's existed and I can surely say this game will take you back to that time and era of misspent hours. These games are EXACTLY the same as the machines back then. You even get to play from the simple 'rollover digit' machines, through the 'LED digit' era all the way to the 'all the ramps, video screen minigame, multiball era. I can say I have played all but a handful of these machines in real life, so if you want a game that will give you that ""take you back"" feeling and you are as old as I am, then this is a game for you...... even despite any small nuances..............

												The game is a lot of fun. Accurate recreation of many classic arcade pinball tables are available. Great physics. Feels responsive. And these tables are some of the best pinball tables ever. True classics with addictive play from the arcades of days gone by. You just have to put up with the new user interface. The older one was better looking and easier to get around. The new UI is less convenient and looks worse. It's not as easy to read or navigate now Sometimes the menu will glitch during navigation with a keyboard or buttons. I don't know what they were thinking.  I am guessing they were probably thinking about mobile touch screens. Good tables. Menu interface really could be better.			"

This game has gone down a slippery slope of becoming just a mobile port. There was no need for the sudden UI change, and it just happened.Other than that, I don't condone you buying in to Farsight's business practices. I've looked it up, and the DLC rivals COD 3 and Sims 3 DLC prices. 6 pinball tables for 30$? No. More like 5$ for 6 pinball tables. 30$ should be a giant pack of tables, not just 6.And no, this game isn't worth downloading unless you absolutely love tale of the arabian nights, and have 420$ to spare just for the other tables.

												If you're looking for pinball, look no further. Pinball Arcade is THE piball game to play. The selection of tables is like a hall of fame of pinball from classics like Pin Bot and my personal favorite, Xenon, to more modern choices such as Star Trek TNG or Adams family and Indiana Jones. All of the tables have been carefully crafted to look and play like their real life counter-parts. From the sounds all the way up to the original LED animations, this is as close to the real thing as it gets. The game is free to download comes with Tales of the Arabian Nights for free but all the other tables will cost you. The prices for individual tables do seem a bit steep. However, if you're a big fan of one particular machine, and only really want to play that one, they can be purchased individually and I feel the price for what you get is pretty fair. The tables can be purchased in bundles at a small discount as well if you need to have it all. I for one enjoy the a la carte style. This is worth it just for the free to play Tales of Arabian Nights, but if you're anything like me, you'll soon want to own your favorites as well.			"

												One of my closest mates actually owns the freebie table with the download the Arabian Nights table (amongst others included in the various pay for expansion packs which I am looking forward to playing so I can compare).He has nights where we all get together and go to his house and just play pins, drink a few beers and simply enjoy each other’s company. Everyone should have a Valentine (in joke).A synthetic reproduction no matter how impressive can't beat that.However. If the Arabian Nights table recreation is a yardstick of quality then HELL YEAH, as I've played it lots on free-play (thanks pal you know who you are) and it owns me :)This is a thing of genuine beauty and love which has obviously been artificially recreated by people who play pins and it's been done with astonishing panache. However, it would all be for nothing if the 'FEEL' of the balls (so to speak) wasn't right. There's no fear here - I hated the real No Fear table almost as much the bloody Shadow – and it just feels RIGHT. Very right in fact and that’s the litmus test. Ball ballistics feel true (no weird unexplained bounces where you blame the table or the game) if you lose a ball then quite frankly it's on you and trust me you will over and over again, it’s a tough table just like its real world counterpart.The fact that they are going down the route of recreating the 'classic' tables in such detail rather than 'inventing' new themed based tables is a massive credit and a brave move because if they get them wrong then owners WILL let them/you know.On the strength of Arabian Nights I WILL be getting the packs in the Steam sale and if like me you love pinball but don't live in a ware house environment enabling you to play the real tables (in my experience the real pinball and retro gaming community are lovely people by the way - take a gander at the Northern Lights site if you fancy the real thing) then this is genuinely your next best option. Onwards and upwards but never down the middle or the sides.A health warning though as it may encourage involuntary symptoms similar to Tourette’s when you lose a ball… just like real pinball - trust me on that......

They are either too bland or just don't 'feel' like a proper pinball and lack depth of goals and features. With 'Pinball Arcade' we have those original arcade machines realised in full detail to take you back to, or introduce you to, those great original full featured tables that used to be in every Arcade all over the world.Over the past few years the developers have recreated an impressive catalogue of classic machines and the choice is vast. If you were into pinballs at all you are bound to find a few favourites in here to take you back.The physics are excellent, the sound of each table is utterly authentic and the tables have nice crisp graphics.This is THE pinball sim for anyone seeking out an authentic pinball experience.I also have this on my ipad mini 2 and thats the version I play the most...

												I grew up in the era of fading arcades, and one of the things that i grew to enjoy was the wide array of different tables available with all the bells and whistles. it took visual pinball to show me that the older tables were just as good. Pinball arcade is the next evoluton needed to preserve the old classics and the more recent gems. are the season packs pricey? Depends on how you look at them. we could easily be paying for each individual table at a time. as they stand season packs do add another thing and that is a chance to try a table that you never would consider before. I do plan to get season six in the near future, just for two tables alone.			"

												This is a good game for those pinheads who simply want tom play the Pinball games they remember.  HOWEVER do not expect the pinball physics to be the same.  For example Theater of Magic feels like you are playing pinball on the moon.  Ball just foats and bounces around everywhere.  As far as the feel of the machines NOPE.  The only to get that is too find a local arcade and play the actual tables.  This hits the ""close enough"" mark to be playable.  Although thru alot of frustration as the ball seems to have a life of it's own.Only reaon for recommending this is it's the only option around for playing a recreation of the actual tables in video game format.As for ""Do you recommend this game?"", it's a 50/50 split and depends on how frustrating the game has been that day.PLEASE fix the damn ball physics already!!

												Pinball Arcade is great but there are persistent bugs that are sad, because when you are playing you want the experience to be perfect.  Sometimes the ball will stutter or move erratically.  Sometimes the ball will move suddenly through a gate.  There are certain bugs that are unique to some table.Overall, if you are a fan of pinball, you have to purchase this game.  I would recommend sticking with the standard versions and avoiding the pro versions, and using that money that you saved to buy all of the seasons.			"

												I wanted to like this game. I really did. The pinball tables themselves are really creative and well-designed and are excellent recreations of the originals, but the user interface is terrible. It's clunky, it's laggy, and it completely fails to take into account that some of us just might want to play with a controller. Custom controller button layouts just won't save, and trying to navigate the menus with a controller is way more difficult than it should be. It's an awful package that obfuscates some really excellent content.			"

												I've probably played every Pinball game in existence on various systems but to me ""The Pinball Arcade"" is easily the best of them all. No need for Gimmics or Special FX it's as close as you can get without playing the actual Pinball table. Although come to think of it sometimes it's better because there's no dodgy flipper or bad reflections as many Arcades place the tables (in the UK at least) too close to a window.The DX11 version is the Mutts Nutts (or DB if you prefer !) and with season 5 upon us there are now over 40 tables available. Sure there are a few crap one's but with 3 of my all time arcade favourites in Fish Tales, The Getaway High Speed 2 & Funhouse faithfully reproduced I can't really complain.The interface is getting a bit clunky now with the number of tables available as you have to scroll through a long list to find the table of your choice. Perhaps a future update will address this with search options or being able to arrange the tables by say season, year or manufacturer as well as a favourites option. When the disc versions of Pinball Arcade Hall of Fame came out on PS2 & Wii all the tables were represented in an Arcade with so many tables in each room which worked well so something along those lines would be good as well. My only real gripe is the Pro version of the tables which is just a rip off. Why not make them available for free if you achieve all the wizard goals on a table ?. Above all it's so much fun to play and although I'm a seasoned player I still get frustrated when a ball drains unexpectedly or I tilt the table just short of my all time high score !. But that's what it's all about realistic gameplay that draws you in to having another go. I'm sure you won't regret buying it but I would wait for a sale before buying the earlier seasons. Who know you may get as good as me with lots of practice but I doubt it ! :).			"

And I think it's way overpriced. 150€ for all 4 season packs? Maybe if its on sale.When you play a challange, a highscore isn't saved on the same regular table.And you can't register for an account on their website.So, if you dont want to invest a lot of money, you can play basicly one table.

Who in the world designed that mess and who in the world approved it thinking it was a great idea and a good design?  Good lord! Horrible! I stopped playing it that’s how crappy it is. The tables are still the same, but I don’t even want to deal with the UI to get to the tables.

												It's difficult to give a simple 'Yes' or 'No' for Pinball Arcade. I really enjoy playing the actual tables and if you are pulled towards nostalgia then its great. The biggest problem I have is with the ball physics, but even that isn't a simple good or bad. Some of the tables, like Bride of Pinbot, play great. Other tables, like Funhouse and Tales of Arabian Nights, have terrible physics and the ball seems to defy gravity, floating all around the table. I have seen some people trying to argue that all of the tables play great with real physics; can only assume they live on the moon. It is something you get used to, but it does make it hard to track the ball and makes for readjusting when switching back to a better table. I am surprised they made Tales of Arabain Nights the free table as it is a complete turn-off. This tells me the company is in complete denial if they think that table is good and a sales conviner. I actually didn't buy the Season packs until I read that some tables have great physics and others, like Tales, are terrible. There are also some issues with camera angles being not always the greatest choices especially if you don't want the camera to jump around and track the ball (I'm not a fan of that). I've noticed some tables, like Theater of Magic, have times where they are choppy for a second or two while most run smoothly all of the time. Overall, I recommend this to a pinball fan. I pretty much consider a handfull of the tables (Funhouse and Tales of Arabian Nights for instance) and won't touch them. I'm not sure if they will ever correct the physics for those and I am not sure as to why different tables have better physics than others. If you are new to pinball, I think Pinball FX is much better with consistently smooth physics. After that, if the pinball bug bites,  try Pinball Arcade, but you should check out something other than the free game.			"

												If you love pinball simulation, then this game is for you. What sets this game apart from other PC pinball games is that all the tables are recreations of actual physical machines. There is a pretty hefty selection of EM, Solid State, and DMD machines from various eras that will keep you busy for a long time. The prices for tables are a little high but I've gotten enough replay out of it to justify the price. Overall, the game is a little buggy, with some tables glitching out here and there, but most of the time it's great. Although nothing can compare to an actual, real life machine, Pinball Arcade is amazing for learning rules and familiarizing yourself with different tables. Highly recommended!			"

												I've always enjoyed pinball machines, even if I'm fairly awful at them. There's something Rube Goldberg-like in all but the most primitive models, and even if bad luck or brutal table design ends my game a few minutes in, it's extremely satisfying getting the various bits and bobs of the table to light up, freak out, and (one can always hope) scream out ""MULTIBALL!"" I realize they aren't for everyone, but for their enthusiasts, pinball machines are about as magical an arcade fixture as you can hope to find.Of course, the fact that they're finely calibrated physical machines puts some serious dampers on how fun they can be. All too often you'll come across some odd, absurd relic of the 70's, 80's, or 90's, only to find that the thing's been horribly maintained. Unresponsive flippers and broken components are just par for the course. Digital pinball games attempt to correct this; so long as your computer or console can handle the game, how could anything possibly be broken? Unfortunately, with a few exceptions, most pinball video games are either shabbily designed, badly coded, or overly complicated, and by definition none of them can carry the physical element of even the most unloved table.While it's not perfect, FarSight Studios' Pinball Arcade is a wonderful compromise between the physical and digital. Rather than creating new material, they've simply licensed an immense pile of existing tables and digitally recreated them with exhaustive attention to detail and physics. Glitches aren't entirely unheard of, but they're extremely rare, and the ability to play these tables as though they were fresh out of the factory is extremely satisfying. On top of the all-too-natural urge to get high scores on everything, each table comes with 10 achievements to complete (5 Standard Goals and 5 Wizard Goals which are unlocked once you've beaten the first batch), and while selecting your table you get a neat little historical blurb about each one, so you know just who to send hate mail to when The Black Knight unfairly destroys you 12 seconds into the game.The price is a touch high, but this is understandable considering the licensing fees involved, and for fans of the genre, just consider the quarters you'll be saving! If you're still unsure about it, you can install the base game for free to get your hands on one starter table (Tales of the Arabian Nights), and once you've played that one to death, buy a season or two and prepare to lose a few dozen hours.

												Loved this, a lot of the old classics are on here recreated perfectly (The original black knight table being one of my favorites), and yeah I do agree that the season table packs are pretty expensive but it's worth it, The minor gripe I have aside from that is that in-game it shows that there is a less expensive option which is a two table pack, would be great if this was listed on steam along side the season table packs.Otherwise I would still recommend it.

												UPDATE: After sinking some time and money into this, it's definitely a winner. At $30, the season 1 pack was pricey, but I've no regrets. The free table, Tales of the Arabian Nights, is also a damn fine one. So this is worth a shot even if you don't plan on spending a dime.----------The ""Free"" portion of this game currently needs clarity. What's ""Free"" is essentially a built in demo system. I didn't know how the payment model worked until launching the game. It's reasonable, but should be more evident up front.In the hopes that I can save y'all some time...Tales of the Arabian Nights is the only table that comes fully free with this download. For everything else the trial/pricing system is as follows:Any table can be played for free on a trial basis. The trial is based on a predefined score for a particular game, and when your reach that score, your game will immediately end. You can trial play a table as many times as you like, but the threshold score is pretty low, and you'll typically get cut off before ball 3.Tables can be purchased in pairs for $5.Every table in a ""season"" can be purchased for $30. There are 22 tables in season 1.I love Bride of Pinbot. It's a machine I've sunk hundreds of quarters into, thus I'm very familiar with it. This recreation looks and sounds just like the real thing. It's such a trip experiencing this table again! I can only assume that the other tables are as accurate. Presentation aside, the physics are a bit weird. The balls come off the flippers at a lower angle than they should, making it much easier to hit the far left and right ramps. The stellar visual/audio recreations make up for any ball motion issues. I will certainly be sinking at least $5 into this. Just be warned that this is not as ""Free"" as advertised... and certainly shouldn't be given the quality.			"

												This is a really good simulation with tables emulated perfectly.  I have the most real life experience with the Haunted House table and the emulation in Pinball Arcade is the best I've ever played.  It feels like the real table.  I'm no pro player, I play for fun and this game is fun.I think the tables are a little expensive but they are superior to the free VP and FP versions I've played.

												The Pinball Arcade is without any doubt, some of the best virtual pinball I've played. From it's fluid and realistic ball physics to the attention to details given to the large selection of tables available, it's easy to see why this latest Farsight release as been so highly praised. A collection of some of pinball's most famous tables are at your fingertips, and you're spoilt for choice with legendary tables such as Star Trek The Next Generation, Black Hole, Terminator 2, Bride of Pin-Bot and Theatre of Magic to name just a few. Plus there's the added bonus of the fact that you can experience the Tales of the Arabian Nights table absolutely free of charge. Yes there are other pinball games available, but no other features tables based on their actual real life counterpart and none even come close to being able to match how it plays a game of Pinball. There are improvements that need to be made, but you really can't go wrong with giving this one a try. If you a pinball fan, it's a must play.			"

And there are some classic tables here but also some best-of-breed (Twighlight Zone) tables too. If you're reading during the Summer Sale 2015, get the season one pro tables at a discount! The sense of humor in these cracks me up (Medieval Madness and Harley-Davidson road trip). Thanks for the attention to detail, game creators!			"

												If you like pinball at all, most of these tables are a must have. This is as close as you are going to get to perfect pinball on a PC outside a cabinet based sim, and then I'd probably recommend still using this software. I've been able to scratch my pinball itch with all these tables. I've purchased two seasons worth of tables for no small amount of money. I've spent more cash on this game than any other for the last several years. The physics are spot on and most of your typical pinball strategies are applicable. Many of the tables virtualized in this game are quite rare and hard to get to play. Some are great playing and not very popular in the arcades (aka Black Rose). While there is no real substitute for a real table, this is pretty good way to relive some of your favorite tables. Black Rose, Medieval Madness, Star Trek, Bride of Pinbot, and Adams Family are just a few of the ones I recommend you try out. All tables have a certain amount of free play in order to try them.

												Just like ships without rudders are not worth commanding, so are most modern video games not worth playing.  I was ready to throw my computer away and just live in the woods when I stumbled upon this retro pinball miracle.  With my eyes wide shut, I was able to enjoy and relive the quarter feeding days of pinball.  With outstanding graphics (in color), I was able to replay pinball tables before the creation of the INTERNET.  For those that enjoy hitting steel balls with flippers, this game is a must, and high scores are recorded on the line.  For being the top pinball king, it is not enough that I succeed; others must fail!!!			"

The only thing that has happened in my 100 hrs of playing it is a stuck ball.  That only happened in one game.  I ""called attendant"" but it didn't work.  I like Table Pack 1 the best, but 2 has some really fun ones.  Sometimes, if you're a fan, it's nice to play the old school ones for a trip down memory lane.  They can be much more challenging.

Trial run of pinball machine are score limited and single player, no options. Four seasons of pinball machines to buy, season one has 21 machines in it (price 29.99 or 39.99) or buy a table pack with the pinball machine you want.    Has a DX11 video mode and a lower video mode.  Each pinball machine looks like and acts like a digital simulation of a real life pinball machine. Except you are not able to see the real scoreboard while playing, and your camera tends to slowly follow the ball( had lost some balls by not seeing the flipper in time) .  Not sure if the physics are really correct compared to real game.  Not sure if you can influence the table like you can in real life.  The flippers seem slow and not as powerfull.Has an online leaderboard and steam achievements.I don't really like real pinball games so i am deleting after reviewing.			"

												What makes this game worthwhile is the faithful recreations of actual pinball tables. The tables are pretty spendy, but it is probably justified by licensing costs. The engine itself is pretty good, but the ball moves faster and feels lighter than it would on an actual pinball table, even immaculate condition machines, which I have played a few. This is only a minor annoyance and the pitch perfect tables are worth the price of admission. The first season is far and away the best deal and has most of the tables you would want anyways. The package is far from perfect however. The UI is awful and little has been done to update it for this platform which really hurts the overall package. The lack of integration with Steam is a missed opportunity considering competing for a high score is a big draw to pinball.  If you love playing actual pinball, this game is for you.If nostalgia isn't part of the package for you, you may be better served with Pinball FX2 which boasts friendslist integration so you can easily see how your friends did on each table and try to beat their top score (which is the reason FX2 is getting more play time from me these days).

It's very fun and getting higher and higher scores is very satisfying. If you get it free, You will only have acces to one pinball table. However, if you spend an extra $20-$30, You will have many more pinball tables to play with. Also, why are you even looking at the reviews? The game's steam page says right there, Mostly Positive. And you can try just one table and If you decide to, buy more tables later if you like it. Just install the game, fun awaits.			"

												The pinball machines feel about as real as possible. It gets a bit pricey if you plan on adding all the machines. With the 3rd season it's starting to feel as if they are runing out of good machines to emulate. The challenges are fun but crash prone, not sure how you get a ball stuck in a machine thats just virtual. Overall it's a lot of fun and brings back fond memories.			"

For newer players, there are lots of hints and tips accessible that show you how to make your shots and achieve your goals and higher scores.Plays great on all of my PCs, and the developers seem to actually care about the feedback they get (like adding portrait mode) and actually fix reported bugs!

Everything else is trials which if you score ''too high'' asks you to purchase the table and won't let you get on hiscore/complete achievements.The gameplay aspect is fine though, the graphics are ok and the game plays well.

												The tables are nice and all, but everything is over priced. Listed as a ""free"" game. Includes only 1 table and they want you to pay for everything else. Last update said ""free table of the month"" - but it isn't free. It is just a trial like all the others that won't let you play through. While mildly entertaining, everything is over priced.

												This impressive collection of authentic tables boasts an exceptional fun factor. Most of these landmark arcade tables are professionally well recreated with a staggering attention to detail in glorious 1080p. Yes, many complained that you have to pay for additional tables - and pro packs might be costly for what they really give. Multiplayer ( tournaments ) and DirectX11 features also not available at the release, only later in 2014.  Otherwise gameplay remains rock solid, fluid, physics quite decent,  though as any video pinball  we might sometimes feel gravity/ball weight not as severe as real tables ( thus developers targeting a wider community ). At the same time, experts still need to work hard in order to level up in the leaderboards and completing some challenging 'wizard goals'.Pros:  package of authentic and licensed tables; a blast to play; beautiful and detailed graphics; wide array of goals to achieve.Cons ( minor ) : gravity/ball physics not always as realistic as purists would have liked; no tournaments several weeks after release.

												I came to Pinball Arcade for one reason alone:  Twilight Zone.  Its my favorite pinball machine by far.  Imagine my delight when I found out that it could be purchased and played legally.  My elation was short lived when I saw the prices for the Pinball Arcade tables.  Even though the table packs would have to drop 75-90% for me to even consider purchasing them I figured I could just pick up Twilight Zone for a fiver and be done with it.

And these inaccuracies are present on other licensed property tables.  If I am going to pay out the nose I expect a product as advertised.Normally I would wait for a Steam sale and pick it up on the cheap but it appears these DLC packs never go on sale.  Maybe they will lower the price once the developers squeeze out the die-hard pinball wizards.  In the end the issues that surround Pinball Arcade make it a no-brainer uninstall.			"

Unfortunately it is locked to 62 FPS (yes, 62). So no luck if you want to play at smooth 120 or 144 FPS that is great for pinball games. By the way Pinball FX2 works fine at 144 FPS.Tables are expensive so I would recommending getting them on sale.

												I said I'd recommend this game, with some huge caveats.I specifically got this game, and paid for a table pack, because I'm obsessed with one particular table. I don't know of a publically playable one anywhere in my vicinity. So for $5 I was able to get the table I wanted. They don't let you buy the tables individually, so it came with a bunch of tables I don't want. That didn't particular bother me because I would have payed that much just for the table I want. They do an EXCELLENT job of recreating the tables to look and play exactly like the real ones. Like this is actually an amazing way to learn about all the game play functionality of your favorite tables. It helped me learn HOW to play my favorite table in much more detail than I had known before. In general the attention to detail on all the tables is pretty incredible. The game just has one major downside, and that is the physics engine that governs the ball. I've played and watched a fair amount of REAL pinball. Many simulators have a thing where you hit the ball and it'll like only half roll up the table, like you hit it softly. This simply doesn't happen in the real world. All the balls are weighted the same and the paddles only hit at one speed and strength. So on my favorite table, it's actually frequently difficult to hit the ball such that it even makes it to the top of the table. Not only is this annoyingly unrealistic, it actually makes playing the game VERY difficult. So DO play this game if you're looking for a cheap game that's decently fun and allows you to reminice and maybe even learn some new things about tables you remember from back in the day. Do NOT play this game if you're looking for a full digital experience that matches the real table. It just doesn't.			"

But given how high-maintenance real tables are, plus how expensive they are in the first place, I am very, very happy that The Pinball Arcade exists.It's not perfect (Cirqus Voltaire, my favorite table ever, needs some serious work on ball physics and Juggler Multiball), but this is BY FAR the best pinball sim out there.But if you're reading this: If you ever find a real machine, even if it's not one of these, please give it a try.

If I am going to pay out the nose I expect a product as advertised.Normally I would wait for a Steam sale and pick it up on the cheap but it appears these DLC packs never go on sale.  Maybe they will lower the price once the developers squeeze out the die-hard pinball wizards.  In the end the issues that surround Pinball Arcade make it a no-brainer uninstall.			"

												The free table is fantastic, but the others seem a bit expensive. It took a bit of getting used to the slight delay between pressing the flipper buttons and the flippers actually engaging, even a bit more so than on a real table, but after adjusting I was able to make some progress :) I was impressed with the visuals, and the physics seem good from my experiences so far. Overall I recommend the free table for what it is, but I'm hesitant to sink major amounts of cash into additional table collections.			"

You may have a crappy score every now and then, but the translation from real pinball machine to a virtual table happened seemlessly.

												The biggest flaw are the horrible floaty physics that don't feel like pinball at all, Balls passing through obstacles. The Web and Timeshock, which came out in 1995 and 1997 respectively, actually felt like a real table.Ugly menu that's up in your face all the time. Want to play a two player game? You can't just hit ""Start"" twice like you would on the real game. Instead you have to go into the menu, set players to two and then start the game.This setting isn't even remembered between games. If you want to start another multiplayer game after both players drain their last ball, you have to go into the menu again.For some reason I can't enter my initials with a gamepad, even though it works during gameplay. I have to use the flipper buttons on the keyboard instead. Oh and the ugly menu pops up during the highscore entry too. Way to break immersion.Camera likes to bug out during multiballs and show the shooter lane instead of the playfield.Basically, the game is only good for learning the table rules. Fortunately you can do that in ""trial mode"", without having to buy a single table.			"

												I want to recommend this game, but I can't while it is labeled as ""free to play."" While you can play every table you can only play them for free until you hit the high score on that table, which for some tables aren't that high. You can purchase a table that you like individually for about $5 or a group for $30. This is not free to play, this is free to demo, if you like pinball then you can't really go wrong here but if you want your experience to be free of stops then prepare to shell out some large amounts of money.

												Of all the games I've bought on Steam, this is the only one that has actually revoked itself from my library. There apparently is a 'contact us' about getting the collection back, and you have to send payment details and other nonsense. This alone makes me never, ever, want to trust these people with a purchase. That's right, I had one of the collections in my library, and it was removed for no reason (as it was for many people). Like PBFX2, the game itself is a poor console port with graphics that are actually superior on consoles than pc. ""they are working on it"" lol.If you format / install on other computers, you will have your high scores overwritten. This dev is clueless on how to make a game work correctly. The tables are nice recreations of real tables, but the whole thing is very feature lacking, you have to pay double for such features as ""free look"" meaning getting to move the camera around... which is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. And frankly most of the time the tables just aren't that fun. Also the collections are very expensive. Don't support console scrub developers who don't care or understand how to make a PC game. This is a very amateurish endeavor.			"

												Okay, the game (steam-version) has some issues. The graphics are not up to date. Some bugs in it, but which game has no bugs?And, unfortunately, a not well implemented friends list and a half decent operator menu.But, that is only one side of the coin. On the other hand you have the best simulation of pinball machines on the market.Physics are great. The ball seems to have weight. The older pinball games have not that good ball physics. A big variety of tables. I´ve never heard of a manufacturer, who made so much (real examples) tables available. Some of the tables are astonishing. I´m never bored and I´m playing every day for 1-2 hours (maybe more ;-))As a member of pinball community you are not sinking in the crowd like in ""bigger"" games. Devs take part of discussion.TPA will be updated in the next months (better graphics DX11).And for me important; While playing pinball, the issues have hardly a stitch on me, because I´m concentrating on movement of the ball! For that reason updates needs to be made, but for me they are not coactive. I have fun with the game in its current state! So, if you like pinball, buy it !!!			"

												I opened up the game expecting a simple pinball game and all I was greeted with was a an option to buy a table pack. If you want to play the game, you have to go through each table as a ""trial"". There's no point in making the game free to play if you can't play it for free. Also the menus could be cleaned up a bit, they are a bit clunky and not very appealing.

I can't believe how poor the texture resolution is and how bad the physics are. Chromed parts looks more like lead, they just don't shine. The lights on the table don't even look like the screenshots above. It looks like the game was made twenty years ago, not three months ago. Never mind every other problem it has (it has many other problems), but poor texture resolution and bad physics suffices to kill it.

												If you really love pinball it's a great little program, very faithful recreations of actual tables, however the textures on the tables are not as good as they should be. Ball physics is a little weird but there's not much you can do about that.Unfortunately I have to give this a thumbs down because it is incredibly buggy. The UI is all kinds of messed up, sometimes you can't use the menus at all, using a gamepad to navigate the UI rarely works, and in the short time I've played several times I've hit start and the game doesn't go, it gets stuck in the table fly-by animation and I need to exit the table. Also a lot of stuff, like what the graphics settings do, what the pro features are, etc. are poorly communicated.It's the best pinball simulation available right now, but it's a shame it lacks so much polish. Only buy a few tables you really like.			"

												I have spent 25 minutes in Pinball Arcade and there is nothing convincing me to go and play it up. Yes the game is free but you need to pay to play full versions of levels which is a pain if your having a good run and it pops up ""sorry your trial of this level is over"" or something stupid like that. However, when your playing the game it is relaxing and fun. Go download Pinball if you want to have 25 minutes of enjoyment then watch it take up space on your hard drive. ALL 2 GB'S OF IT!!!!			"

												I have nothing against the game. there is one table that is free to play. The game is pretty old school and not really for me. The concept of the game, which is, from what I can gather, cherishing the memories of old style American pinball arcade machines, the tables look very authentic and cool but the game play is a little slow, and I wouldn’t want to spend that much money on getting the other tables as I’m not old enough to care about American pinball arcade history. so I would say, like I would to any free game, give it a shot, it’s free!! If it’s for you, you have the choice of investing further in the game. PS - To young people this is probably not a game for you and you will find it boring.			"

												Pinball Arcade is a little different from most digital pinball games in that all of the tables are replicas, or near replicas of real classic pinball tables. This fact is one of the reasons I like the game so much, it helps though that not only are real tables in the game but there are brief but detailed descriptions of each table along with a snippet of the the tables history. The game features one free table, and lets you play the others as a trial before you decide if you want to purchase them, a feature common with most pinball games at this time. Pinball Arcade is free so if you like Pinball you should at least give this game a try, you never know you might learn something about pinball along the way.			"

												It is hard to develop a good pinball game. Farsight has done what others have such a hard time with. They bring real tables from across several decades of pinball tables. From Medieval Madness to Star Trek. With new tables monthly and Kickstarters to get more popular tables. This is a must have. Every table has a trial peroid that ends when you hit a certain score. The DLC shows Season Pass tables but that's not the only way to buy tables. In the game you can buy the table packs that can be 2-4 tables. for $3-5.			"

												ahhhh Nostalgia. Being a older gamer, I remember when kids used to congregate at the mall arcade to see and play the latest and greatest in a blossoming video game industry. In this age of bleep blop beloop 8-bit graphics there sat in the corner the legacy of the last great gaming icons. The pinball machines. Like dinosaur bones they just looked really cool but no one would really play those when you had sitdown SpyHunter or Tron Discs to drop tokens on. Yet I was attracted to these machines, whose art and design were always such a pleasure to see. And when games started rising to 2 tokens per play, the pinball machines stayed at one. So i started playing them, Black Knight, Fun House, Adams Family, etc.... and I gained an appreciation for the ancestor to my hobby. Now all the arcades are dead. Im an old guy with a job i work too hard at. So when I found out about this recreation of the machines that were so cool to me back in the day, I immediately loved it. These painstakingly recreated pinball machines pull me right back into that mall arcade in 1986. If youre a retro gamer, if you like pinball...you will appreciate this game.8 out of 10.			"

												Looks awesome, can't deny it. So I said let's give it a go, it's for free!Download the game, launch it, loads of menus.. way more than you would expect in a pinball game. Then you get the catch, you only have a trial version and, fair enough, you have to pay for the full game.But when I started my first play and I was literally kicking aXes, I'm suddenly interrupted by a pop-up window saying I've reached the cap for the trial version. I mean, are you serious? Can't even complete one single game?I was already tempted to give these guys a few quid for a nice looking pinball, but that feeling is now completely gone, killed and buried by the worst marketing strategy ever.Sorry if you think I'm blunt, that's just my 2 cents.

Granted, if you're not into pinball, there's nothing really here for you, but without spending any money you do get full access to one table and can demo every other table without paying a dime.PROS: Very good (though not perfect) physics, table designs are nearly spot-on to the real machines, includes a mix of various tables from the most popular to the least popular, as well as from the most common to the absurdly rare, actual ROM data is being used so the tables have all of their hidden features and everything, all of which are documented in-game, extensive instructions available for every table to make learning the rulesets much easier.CONS: Default configuration and camera settings are garbage for anyone looking to REALLY play the game, so you need to reconfigure everything, the ""Call Attendant"" feature for dealing with issues can't handle most of the problems which crop up (which are thankfully few and far between), very expensive if you want ""pro"" access to all the tables (extra configuration settings and options for examining the table)... still cheaper than owning just a single REAL machine. :P			"

												Quick review to start: Holy cow is this ever fun to play!  The only caveat to recommending the Pinball Arcade is that, naturally, it's all about pinball and maybe that doesn't float your boat.  I do believe that pinball is universally entertaining however if you accept the inherent gameplay mechanics and so if you play this game you'll find happiness.This is the second major pinball system on Steam now, but I will rate it unquestionably the best.  Why?  Because it *feels* perfect.  All the physics involved has a very satisfying sense of weight to it... the ball accelerates believably, the timing of when you strike the ball with your flippers affects the trajectory properly, and the rebounds from bumpers and sidewalls fits your expectations just *right*.  This is absolutely the best playing pinball experience you'll find on Steam.  There IS still room for improvement however but those are fiddly details that you'll hardly notice (the ball never leaves the table surface making certain actions reliably consistent compared with reality, the flippers are rock-solid and don't have any ""spongeyness"" that happens with real tables, and the friction of the table surface and steel rails is constant which again makes the ball behavior suffer no random deviations).  I've been familiar with pinball games, but I'm not a nut for the genre, and so I'm not bothered by the lack of absolute authenticity with the real tables.  Each game that's recreated here scores high by replicating a faithful experience.  You probably won't be able to ""train"" on these virtual recreations and expect perfect knowledge about how to work the real thing, but you WILL get all the entertainment that was built into the original games.  And on the note about those original games.... WOW!  The variety of tables to play is astonishing from truly old school pinball experiences from the 1960's to classic 70's and 80's table complete with early arcade sounds (I *love* those sounds!) to the zenith of pinball evolution in the mid 1990's.  The Pinball Arcade is truly a museum piece approach to the genre that shows no favorites for any one time period or manufacturer.  The breadth of choice is very, very nice!Some other things to note: all the tables present in this game are recreations of the originals which were designed to eat your money.  This is important to remember because even though there's no longer any quarters being spent to play there can be a lot of frustrating moments where your game ends prematurely because happenstance physics will cause your ball to drain no matter how skillful you can play.  It's possible to ""nudge"" the machine in multiple directions in an attempt to coax the ball into a different trajectory but I can't count how many times I've had terrible games because the ball just dumps itself down the drain prematurely.  Another important thing is that the game is going to be receiving a visual upgrade in 2014 when the developers release a DirectX 11 patch that adds much more modern lighting support and (hopefully!) texture map resolution bumps.  The game looks great already but these two additions will make the experience even more lifelike and exciting.  I do have some gripes to make about the game however.  Currently there's no support for Steam Friends in game, which is something that Zen Studio's ""Pinball FX 2"" supports and I miss it.  You are encouraged to make a FarSight Studios account in order to have your scores ranked against other people, but there's something mighty satisfying about seeing your scores compared with people you actually know on Steam, and that's just not present right now.  Another complaint is that the Steam release still shows heavy connections to the Pinball Arcade releases on lower performance hardware (tablets, iphone, Android, etc.).  The game still PLAYS fantastic, but there's a level of spit and polish to the user interface and camera controls that's just not right for a PC game and cheapens the experience.  The last thing I have to say about the base Pinball Arcade experience concerns the Free-to-Play nature of the title.  ""Free-to-Play""... eh.... it is and it isn't.  When you download the game from Steam you will be downloading ALL the tables which you can play as long as you want UP UNTIL THE FIRST HIGH SCORE.  This is actually rather generous because it means there's no time's-up-and-you're-locked-out-until-you-buy penalty, and in practice I found that the minimum high score threshold is high enough for you to play for a good amount of time in a single game and it's only when you really start getting your skill up that you find yourself hitting that ceiling.  Once you do starting bumping up to that limit you'll likely have found some favorite tables to play and you can then purchase them individually or all at once via the Season Packs.  There's even one pinball machine you can play forever (Tales of the Arabian Nights) that is extremely fun and definitely not a ""throwaway bone"" for the FTP monicker.  For all that this offers for free I say check it out right away and see if it finds a place in your heart... there's a lot to love here and I daresay if you're not a pinball fan when you start playing you will be when you're finished.

												Changing my review from a tepid buy, to a buyer beware.  The trials are likely sucker versions, made to be easier, and I believe, more fun.I did not opt to buy the pro/cheat versions.  At some point pinball tables were composed in such a way as to max,  profitability, at the expense ofa fun gaming experience.  Unfortunately,  PAs efforts reflect this concept perfectly.PA tables are very pretty, nostalgic, but with only very few notable exceptions,  just not much fun.Those wanting games for just plain fun, would do better to look elsewhere.  And do bewarewhen you see way too many positive posts, with practically no negative reviews.  More than likely shills.  This means a flood by promoters, rather than honest attempts to supply objectivity, and balance.   Happens online all the time.  Don't be a sucker.			"

												BOTTOM LINE----------------This game is bad. do not get. you start out with one ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pinball game, and you have to pay a ton more money to get others. You also get only a couple of tokens, one play each, before you have to spend more money to get more.    I really enjoy pinball so I was excited to get this, but turned out CRAP. Do not get unless you have alot of time to wast and alot of money to spend.   PS- don't know what all these good reveiws are about...			"

												Those afflicted with tunnel vision and colorblindness beware!Are you used to games where things are easy to see? Games like TF2, where the graphics are clean and the characters pop from 20 miles away? Then this isn't the game for you. A selection of terrible camera angles, cluttered boards full of layered tubes and flashing lights, and fast-moving, dull-colored balls ensure you'll lose track of the ball several times per round.This is a 12-inch-tall computer screen, not a 4-foot long board. Give us some visibility options.			"

												The pinball- from what I've seen- is okay. I wouldn't say ""Arabian Nights"" plays precisely like the arcade- the slope of the table seems a little steep- but on the positive side, I've seen very few real-world versions of the table where every moving part worked as well and smoothly as it should, so that's definitely a plus.The death of this for me is disk space. 11.3 GB for the one free table I play once in a blue moon. Pinball is like solitaire for me- something I pick up when I want a quick, ten minute game fix, not a three-hour session. I would be far more likely to consider buying more content if the game didn't seem to store every bloody table on my hard drive under the premise that I *might* want to buy them and they should be instantly available the moment I did. As 'tis, I let this go to free up the hard disk space.Some reviewers have commented that this seems like a port from one of the mobile versions, but I'm going to hazard a guess that the mobile versions don't try to store every possible sale item on your tablet.Bad call on that decision, Farsight. If you ever update this so it doesn't take up more space than Saint's Row III, I will probably chip in for ""Midieval Madness"". As it is- get off my computer!			"

												My love of this game mostly stems from breathless nostalgia, as in ""I wonder if it has Cactus Canyon OH MY GOD IT DOES and OH WOW there's Whirlwind I haven't played that since I was a kid and HOLY CRAP FUNHOUSE I was terrified of that one!!"". If you've ever played any of the tables featured, definitely check it out.I've also come to appreciate the game as kind of a historical museum. I'm not really a pinball afficianado, but I do like browsing through the tables and seeing how trends came and went over the decades. The transition from electromechanical to solid state, the way targets gave way to ramps, the fascination with multiple playfields and flippers that slowly died out, etc. I dunno, it's interesting.If I had to criticize the game, I'm not a fan of how most tables come in packs of two. I bought Cactus Canyon and found myself saddled with Central Park. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the charms of an electromechanical table, but I'd really prefer something more traditional, like Big Shot. But if I bought Big Shot I'd also get Scared Stiff, which I didn't care too much for, and yeah, you see where this is going.I'm not knowledgable enough to discuss the physics and how accurate they are. It SEEMS like the ball should be going faster than it is. Compare any gameplay video of a table in Pinball Arcade to a video of its real-life counterpart and you can definitely see a difference. Maybe it's just a matter of perspective. Most videos of real pinball games are shot either from the side or from straight up, and it's been far too long since I've been to an arcade to remember if it feels any different.			"

												First off: This is the best Pinball Simulation ever! Non of the competing pinball games of the recent years even come close to the overall presentation and feeling of Pinball arcade. Every table in this game is an extremely detailed digital replica of a realworld table. Everything is faithfully simulated, every light, sound and even the backboards. Nice touch: Every table comes with a little bit of trivia, where you can learn about it's original creators and history.The pinball machines are sold separately or in season packs. Buying a season pass saves you a good amount of money over buying the tables separately. The amount and variety of tables in every season is spot on. OK, some tables are not my cup of tea, but the majority is very interesting and I love playing them.There is just one little thing that I don't like about this game: The developers want extra cash for a so called ""pro"" version of their tables. The difference is that you are able to access the operators menu that every table has, where you are able to change the amount of balls or at what score you get an extra ball. It seems a bit greedy to me, that I would have to pay extra for something like that.For an arcade freak like me this game is just great and highly recommended.My verdict: 9/10 - Great game.			"

												I have not had the pleasure of playing any of these pinball games in real life, and I'm glad Pinball Arcade exists because I have found them to be enthralling experiences. The detail is impressive, and the myriad of tasks you have to accomplish on each table is varied and challenging. I can't offer any reliable opinion on whether the physics are accurate or not, but the game is loads of fun.Definitely check this out if you're the least bit curious about pinball and pinball history. I only wish the game let us examine the tables in more detail -- maybe a way to walk around the table and inspect every little detail on it.			"

												amazing game.this is very cool, challenging, addictive, both a vintage nostalgic, yet modern gaming experience, makes me want to track down and play an old pinball machine, fairly slim chance of that ever happening due to obvious reasons, this is the next best thing i would assume.never played much actual pinball back in the day, the video arcade machines had taken over by the time i was goin to arcades as a kid, and the few I did come across never seemed to work, or always had some problems.The vibrant lights, colors, sounds, everything, of all the old tables,  is perfectly captured, this is like a pinball simulator and with the old classic tables i assume alot of people have a favorite table, so each ones popular for its own reasons...the fact you can look at the vintage flyer ad of the original machine is very cool aswell.and i only played the first free table, cant wait to try some other ones, lovin this pinball stuff lol.

												Sweet graphics and ball-handling.  Super selection of tables, especially Season 1.Also great is that you are  able to go to ""portrait mode"" in Windows, tilt monitor, then run the Pinball Arcade setup for portrait mode.Downside:Little documentation on keyboard controls except in the submenus of each game.What is the advantage of the ""PRO"" tables?  Should be spelled out better on Steam.For better full-screen experience on NVIDIA cards (less keyboard lag), open NVIDIA control panel, select manage 3-D, and set maximum pre-rendered frames  to ""1"", not ""auto""Cheers!

												8/10 (price is steep)If you are a fan of pinball (which I am) this might be the closest you will ever get to owning your own table. I’ve played all the machines as their real-life counterparts and this game does an incredible job of recreating the experience. It is an expensive game when you factor in all three seasons worth of content but if you are a fan of the genre then you understand it’s a very small investment to own such a high-quality collection of tables. The game has a few older tables but recent updates have really focused on more modern games; which is nice. If you like pinball I would recommend this game wholeheartedly and definitely recommend it over Pinball FX.			"

												Not only am I huge fan of hit arcade games from the 90's but I'm also a huge one of Pinball machines. When I was a little child of ADHD mental disability these things took me by storm with flashy lights, corespondant dot matrix display that interacted with the action, ramps, rails and rabbit holes, and what's even harder to believe is that all the ones I've seen in real life are there too. Attack From Mars, still can't get a straight shot to that UFO. Haunted House made me scream in terror when I heard ""Old Man Death"" play as my ball slipped into the drain. Funhouse brought back memories of smelling freshly cooked hot wings in the bowling alley and the smell of adreniline pumping with every press of the buttons. I give this game a very nostalgic score of S+, for SUPERBLY ADDICTINGLY AWESOME!			"

												This pinball simulator is awesome!!! I have been looking for something like this for a long time now and for them to offer freeplay is spectacular to allow you to get the feel for their work. They have really thought long and hard about this simulator and it really shows. You can of course just skip all the reading and go in, select your choice of pinball game, click the free mode to avoid buying or spending any money and play up to whatever the limit of score is on that game. There is one unlocked table you can play. It might seem kind of steep in price but I actually think it is worth it if you really love some of these pinball machines! Think about it this way, a real pinball machine cost from maybe $400 and up (sky is the limit) and they will not usually be in the best of shape or condition. Then you have to have a means of getting the machine to where you live or where you intend on putting it, then you might have to have it serviced, repaired, or tuned. Then... did it come with any of the original manuals, articles, history, or know-how about how the game is to be played, the scoring, and all the wizardy integrated into advanced possible features of the machine (90% of the time, no)? In this simulator, the games sound great and original, the visuals are as if you have your machine in beyond mint condition... forever, there is no service to have to have on the game... it just works! And, if you have a mobile computer with fast enough GPU, it's completely portable! This simulator works perfect on my higher end desktop PC and I have enjoyed getting into all of the reading material included too. The actions, sounds, gameplay mechanics, everything is there.Now... developers if you are reading this... how about getting those amazing Pirates of the Caribbean pinball machines into the game? I would definitely buy that one as I was trying to figure out how to recreate one in VirtualPinball on my own... it's deffinitely not easy yet you have done all the hard work for everyone here on Steam! Thank you! Now take my money and make more pinball machines! :D			"

												If you are looking for free pinball, this probably isn't the game for you. If you are a legitimate pinball enthusiast, this game is well worth purchasing.Though table packs are rather pricey, the amount of fun and satisfaction you can get out of one (Especially the first two seasons) are well worth it. Unlike Pinball FX 2 it's major competitor, tables in Pinball Arcade are LEGITIMATE real life tables that you know, love, loathe and remember.Classics like FunHouse, Creature from the Black Lagoon, Star Trek TNG and Terminator 2 are all masterfully restored with realistic physics, all the legitimate features, bells and whistles of the original table. Marvellously simulated, these classic tables come with custom ball capability (Whether for visibility or just for shiggles), multiplayer options and a plethora of views to suit your taste.The goals are realistically achievable and if you fancy yourself a wizard you can post your scores online to try to out-flip the rest of the cyberverse.Lots of pros, with the 2 cons being A) price as the content rarely goes on sale and B) the lack of cross-platform account sync. (IE Though I have Season 2 Table Pack unlocked on my PC, I can't play those tables on my Android.)Is this something you typical demanding ADD gamer case will want to splurge on? Probably not. But if you're a pinball enthusiast who has a hard time finding a place with solid tables to play or even who wants to practice for the real deal, you need to have Pinball Arcade (And ideally, seasons one or two table packs, if not both.)

												I absolutely recommend this game.  As a 20 year veteren as a Arcade/Pinball technician, I love that FarSight is making real world tables to bring back the memories from when Pinball Arcades were in their hayday.FarSight is getting very comfortable in this niche and each table brings more nostalgia and excitement with each release.The one thing that keeps me from liking Zen Studios tables more is that there nudging is not as fluent and realistic as it is in The Pinball Arcade. You get like 2 nudges per 15 seconds and then instant tilt no matter what.  Also, straight down the middle shot in Pinball FX 2 can not be diverted like you can in FarSights Pinball Arcade.   I enjoy PA tables so much that when they start supporting Xbox One (which they stated they will), I'll buy the tables all over again.Here's to more happy pinballing in the future.

												8/10 (price is steep)If you are a fan of pinball (which I am) this might be the closest you will ever get to owning your own table. I’ve played all the machines as their real-life counterparts and this game does an incredible job of recreating the experience. It is an expensive game when you factor in all three seasons worth of content but if you are a fan of the genre then you understand it’s a very small investment to own such a high-quality collection of tables. The game has a few older tables but recent updates have really focused on more modern games; which is nice. If you like pinball I would recommend this game wholeheartedly and definitely recommend it over Pinball FX.			"

												Not only am I huge fan of hit arcade games from the 90's but I'm also a huge one of Pinball machines. When I was a little child of ADHD mental disability these things took me by storm with flashy lights, corespondant dot matrix display that interacted with the action, ramps, rails and rabbit holes, and what's even harder to believe is that all the ones I've seen in real life are there too. Attack From Mars, still can't get a straight shot to that UFO. Haunted House made me scream in terror when I heard ""Old Man Death"" play as my ball slipped into the drain. Funhouse brought back memories of smelling freshly cooked hot wings in the bowling alley and the smell of adreniline pumping with every press of the buttons.

As soon as Farsight adds cabinet support this will be a 10/10 must have for any pinball enthusiast. For now I'm enjoying the game in portrait mode on my PC. Hoping someday that we'll see extra features like customizable light upgrades and swappable parts for each table, along with multiple monitor support, and DMD options but that's just a specific wish of mine, the game is great right now and it's definitely worth picking up if not only to support the creation of future content from Farsight.

												While this was already a wonderful game in DX9 mode, with the recent addition of DX11 support (if you have a recent and fairly powerful graphics card, I'm using two nVidia GTX Titan in SLI with 3D surround enabled here) this game now looks utterly stunning. I couldn't quite believe it was the same game, all of the tables look so much better, especially Black Hole, Attack From Mars, and Circus Voltaire. You can even adjust the room lighting (to around 20%) so as to give the feeling of a real arcade, and adjust the lamp brightness accordingly (55% or lower seems good). When playing with the nVidia 3D surround turned on (press Ctrl T to disable/enable it), there is still a little issue with the light from some of the brighter bulbs appearing to be rendered at a slightly incorrect perspective, i.e. ""floating"" above the table. I'll try to bring this bug to Farsight's attention, to see if they can get it fixed, but in the meantime just lowering the bulb brightness slightly to around 45% when playing in 3D surround mode with DX11 seems to be sufficient.  Note: the room and bulb settings are under each table's options menu, they're not set from the game's launcher. At the moment, to get into fullscreen mode, you can either select it from the DX11 settings in the game's configuration launcher, or press the Alt-Enter key combination while running the game itself. At the moment, when running with DX11, the game only makes use of the center monitor in nVidia 3D surround mode (whereas when running in DX9 mode it uses all three monitors), so it feels slightly less immersive. It'd be nice to get full 5760x1080 resolution working in landscape mode like it does in DX9 mode. But overall, the DX11 support is such a huge improvement that I feel it already brings this game up to ""must-have"" status among all games on the PC platform. Awesome job, Farsight!			"

												Personally, one of the greatest FPS shooters of all time. I mean, really, you got the next gen graphics of a SEGA Dreamcast, all puckered up in the nice package of a Nalgene Hiker's Cantene. (Made in the US of A version, of course.) Now look hun, you may be saying right now, Patroklos, what does a Tabuu designed wallet from Six Flags have to do with the greatest 3rd Person Shooter in Bumble Bee Blast's history? Well I'll tell yah. Personally, I preffered the original Sonic the Hedgehog over Generations or Ep. 4, but in the end, you know, they all dah same. Now look here, tight skirtz on alligators may be rockin' thecaboose, but the only viable class in this game is the SMG genre. Trying to pull some S4 plays with CQC tactics just ain't gonna work no more. You'll get smoked, yah damned grease monkey. So, the conclusion: Flamingo kills ARE different than Dunder kills.      P.S.      If I knew Bubsy Adventure 3D and Dyrone Tonk were makin' an album, I never woulda hooked up with Hip Hop McGee. Please forgive me.                          ~The Culling~			"

												Medieval Madness, The Addams Family, Twilight Zone, Champion Pub... they're all here, and more! All the arcades in my town have gone the way of the dodo, so this is the closest I'll get to reliving some wonderful childhood memories. Great tables, five(!) seasons worth of selections - good times to be had.			"

												I felt I had to redo this review mainly because so much has changed. The game supports DX11 now and on my screen it looks great. Some people have had issues with the new User Interface and some table problems. I did play a few games of pinball today 06/26/2016  and I had no issues to report. I did play in DX11 and man do the tables just sparkle with DX11 compared to DX9. Some people despise the new user interface. Its not perfect for sure. However its ok. I suppose it could be  better. However I havent had a crash yet on both a Laptop W10 with a newish i3 using onboard graphics only. I have also played this on my desktop W10 with a nvidia 750ti. Still no crashes. I do think people have an unrealistic view on some issues. The sound issue is a biggie. Most pinballs had mono sound. Not stereo like a lot of people think. Also some pinball ROMS just are not very good because the tables were flaky in real life. High Roller Casino I am looking at you. Grrrrr.  Also most  people playing this are not going to notice the small things that are wrong with some of the tables. That being said Pinball Arcade is not perfect however it is solid in my opinion. If you really want to see bad pinball look at Fantastic Pinball Thrills. Very awful reviews for a reason bad gameplay.  So I am not saying the tables are not without fault. I have heard of people saying the game will crash.  However I have not had it crash on me yet. I did play a few games in DX9 as well. I could not get the game to crash during my play time. So if your like me  and loved the old pinball games and dont have thousands to spend on the real deal or have the space then this is a good buy. The ball physics are the top of the line and the tables are mostly like I remember them being. Also I want to mention Zaccaria Pinball as its not getting the love and attention it deserves. Granted the tables are older and not as cutting edge as Pinball Arcade however give it a chance and play the free table. Its a good game of pinball and a good team of dedicated people over their.. The game comes with one table unlocked and the others have a score limit so you can play them and see if you like them. I think this is a golden age for pinball players like us. We have so many choices now its crazy good.			"

And they got the graphics up to the XBox One version on PC with the new DX11 builds.Plays great, has some classic tables, get it!Wish tables could come out more frequently, but I look forward to my monthly updates.Also wish the friends leaderboards were updated no matter what mode you played (Tournament, Challenge, etc.)Bring on Eight Ball Deluxe and Black Jack from 1975!

												I've turned around on this one. At first, I didn't care much for the old school approach. It isn't REALLY accurate. If it were, I could smack and kick the table.....and lose ridiculous amounts of quarters just to get my name on the top score. (I don;'t think that will be happening on this.) I've found a few tables I played back in the day. That's what won me over....nostalgia.Having said that, Pinball FX2 is modern and faster and fits the times. This one is NOT real pinball. It's a simulation of real pinball. There are things in REAL pinball that you can do with hand /eye/body cooridantion that you can't do here. What do I mean by body? When paying real pinball,you can move, angle , shake the table, nudge lightly or hard. That's impossible to duplicate . So, to me, having been a real arcade-troll who actually played Elvira's table, and the Black Hole table, anyone who says this is real ...hasn't played real pinball.Why do I like PinballFX2 better? It could be nothing more than the modern feel and the graphics. The gameplay is fairly similar....although Pinball Arcade doesn't alllow for a small space between lower flippers, which is accurate, FX2 makes up for it in speed and the need to be extremely accurate . It also employs video game animations and character models. Does that mean I don't like this game? Nah. It's fine I just think the argument that it's REAL and FX2 isn't is absurd. The other thing is, Pinball FX offers up better graphics out of the box....no need to have any special video card bs....or knowledge of how to change your video settings so you can play. THAT'S effed up.  They need to fix that and lower the prices. They want you to think they've done something special. They didn't even design the tables if you think about it. So....why pay more?

The attention to detail is amazing, and it's obvious that the team behind this is completely dedicated to preserving the legacy of pinball. Buying the individual table packs may seem a bit high at $5 for one or two tables, but considering how many quarters I would have pumped into them by now it's actually totally worth it in the long run.

												I had never even sen a pinball machine before, yet alone played on one until I started playing The Gottlieb Collection on PSP. Since then ive been hooked, I then went on and purchased the williams collection on my xbox 360 and was totally mesmerised. When they announced this game was coming to steam I was delighted due to the lack of support on the 360. The sheer variety of tables is amazing, and best of all there all free to try. In my opinion, if you are debating wether to download this or not just do it, its free to try and whatever you like and want to own, you buy.			"

												The free table on Pinball Arcade (Tales of the Arabian Nights) is a meticulous recreation of an awesome pinball machine I remember playing when I was younger. In Pinball FX2 every table is new and the creators often chose to do things that work in a computer game but could never fly in an actual physical machine. The design here has a different feel. When the ball bounces off a bumper it seems more real and not like a digital object with a metallic texture.If the tables were priced a little lower I'd snap a bunch up. Eventually I'll probably get one of the packs of tables, but the cost is a bit more than I would spend in an impulse buy, which is how I make most of my Steam purchases. But certainly the free table here is a lot of fun, so there's no reason to miss out.			"

The gameplay is fairly similar....although Pinball Arcade doesn't alllow for a small space between lower flippers, which is accurate, FX2 makes up for it in speed and the need to be extremely accurate . It also employs video game animations and character models. Does that mean I don't like this game? Nah. It's fine I just think the argument that it's REAL and FX2 isn't is absurd. The other thing is, Pinball FX offers up better graphics out of the box....no need to have any special video card bs....or knowledge of how to change your video settings so you can play. THAT'S effed up.  They need to fix that and lower the prices. They want you to think they've done something special. They didn't even design the tables if you think about it. So....why pay more? I don't know. Seems like nothing more than el;itism and greed to me.			"

												I recently went to Seatle for a short vacation and visited the pinball museum to discover that I absolutely love old 80's and 90's pinball. One of teh first  things I did on coming home was look for a decent simulator on Steam, I'm very happy with what I found. Simulations of real games I've played, the game work sgreta and teh free version is pretty generous with times, as much as it does suck to get kicked off right when you're doing well (base don score rather than time so you can play a table for quite a while if you're not getting point multipliers). The prices are also pretty reasonable, I'm saving up to buy the 30$ first set but I bought one table for 5$ flat so I'd have soemthing to focus on until then.			"

												As an avid pinballer in my youth, nostalgia crept in when I gave Pinball Arcade a try. Sure, it won't beat playing on the real machines, but it's the next best thing. The ball physics are pretty accurate, although it feels like there are certain tables that drain out too much due to the design. Hopefully the developers can keep this game active and provide more tables to purchase.Recommended for anyone who loves pinball.			"

												The free table on Pinball Arcade (Tales of the Arabian Nights) is a meticulous recreation of an awesome pinball machine I remember playing when I was younger. In Pinball FX2 every table is new and the creators often chose to do things that work in a computer game but could never fly in an actual physical machine. The design here has a different feel. When the ball bounces off a bumper it seems more real and not like a digital object with a metallic texture.If the tables were priced a little lower I'd snap a bunch up. Eventually I'll probably get one of the packs of tables, but the cost is a bit more than I would spend in an impulse buy, which is how I make most of my Steam purchases. But certainly the free table here is a lot of fun, so there's no reason to miss out.			"

												I've turned around on this one. At first, I didn't care much for the old school approach. It isn't REALLY accurate. If it were, I could smack and kick the table.....and lose ridiculous amounts of quarters just to get my name on the top score. (I don;'t think that will be happening on this.) I've found a few tables I played back in the day. That's what won me over....nostalgia.Having said that, Pinball FX2 is modern and faster and fits the times. This one is NOT real pinball. It's a simulation of real pinball. There are things in REAL pinball that you can do with hand /eye/body cooridantion that you can't do here. What do I mean by body? When paying real pinball,you can move, angle , shake the table, nudge lightly or hard. That's impossible to duplicate .

												I'm an old school pinballer who's had a bias against computer versions for more than 20 years. But Pinball Arcade turned me around with Theatre Of Magic. It was a table I loved, loved, loved back in the 90s. The IRL version, however, was notorious for breaking. We had three TOM's in my hometown (Athens GA) and at least two always had broken Trunks, which if you know TOM then you know a broken Trunk makes the game unplayable.It took a second to get used to using the triggers on my controller, but once I did it was almost just-like the real thing. The game, all together, is a little pricey but there's plenty of value for the money.			"

												This review covers Black Hole, Ripley's Believe It or Not, Tales of the Arabian Nights and Theatre of Magic. I will edit the review if and when I buy and play more tables.The pinball physics engine is really good for the most part. There are some noticeable ball speed issues where they seem to move at unrealistically fast speeds in comparison to real-life pinball machines. Depending on the table, there are some major differences between the quality of the textures and sounds, but it's usually acceptable. The worst textures are of the flooring and walls, but those can't really be considered as being parts of the tables. It would be nice if the developers actually made an effort to polish every facet of the game though, since the flooring and walls are also part of the gaming experience. At the time of this writing we are waiting on an apparently big DirectX 11 patch, but there's no telling if the overall look and presentation will actually be improved or if more negative aspects will be erroneously added because of the update. Let's hope it's a positive change.Some tables seem to be plagued by various bugs. I'm not sure if these bugs are also present in the real-life machines, but in Ripley's Believe It or Not, there are some game breaking bugs. Balls will get stuck and the game engine doesn't recognize some key moments, and these bugs will make you stuck. The only way to fix it is to quit the game and go back. I've contacted support about these bugs and they said that they are aware of these bugs and are working on fixes at the time of this writing.All four tables I played seem to be emulated well, despite the issues I've mentioned earlier. What's great about Pinball Arcade is that all tables available are based on actual real-life machines. You won't find any digital pinball related gimmicks or gameplay mechanics. This game is almost like an unlimited, interactive museum of these classic gaming machines where physics, reflexes, and skills are all that matter. On the other hand, in addition to the lack of overall polish and some bugs, my other complaint is about their pricing model. I understand some people may feel that $30 per pack is reasonable, but I feel that it's a mistake. If the prices were lower and if there were good sales, I'm sure they would sell much more on Steam. It also seems like the Steam/PC platform is not their priority, as they appear to be spending much more time with other platforms. Overall, if you have an interest in playing real-life pinball machines on your PC, this is probably one of the best options available, and new tables are supposed to be added on a monthly basis.Pinball Arcade is good.

												Other than the Pinball Arcade on PSP, this was my first foray into virtual pinball. Farsight offered a UI that was not only attractive and easy-to-use, but also semi-customizable. All-in-all, Farsight did a good job at simulating a lot of classic tables and also did a good job of balancing the amount of tables made by a certain manufacturer. Some are glitchier than others, and sometimes the physics are a little too forgiving, but all in good time these issues will be fixed, right?Sadly, no. There are a good deal of glitches that have apparently been in the game long-before I started. In Black Knight the ball phases right through the flipper at times. This is one of their oldest tables, and yet the issue has not been addressed.Also, that nice UI I was reffering to is long-gone. Half-of-the-time I'm unable to even access some of my bought tables. When I scroll down through the list they just dissappear. Also, navigating via cursor keys through the menu (who uses a mouse for a pinball game?) is near impossible. Instead of scrolling through the table list, the cursor just darts around all over the screen; auto-scrolling (until the tables disappear) and choosing random menu entries until you decide to use the mouse. I'm starting to ramble, so I'll just say, Mouse selection isn't all roses either.As for a nice representation of all manufacturers, as of season 6 that is also no more. Apparently their contracts with Bally and Williams temporarily expired, so Season 6 is mostly made up of Gottlieb (bad other than EM's) and Stern (worse). What about Bally's Embryon or William's Big Guns?The cherry on top is that Farsight is now developing another game known as ""Stern Pinball Arcade"". This game has an even worse UI than TPA and doesn't even have an options menu (One-Resolution fits all). Instead of focusing their apparently limited resources on one dying game they're now spreading them between a dying game and a game that was dead on arrival.Maybe I'm being a bit overcritical, and I would agree if the game didn't cost you nearly $200 to own all of these pinball games. I've already sunk over $100 into the game, but I've since moved onto other Pinball Simulators. Visual Pinball X and Future Pinball are both free, and nowadays look as good as TPA, have more games, and are pretty simple to set up. Zaccaria Pinball is also finally starting to shape up as one of the better simulators out there (and is waaaay cheaper than TPA). I strongly suggest you look at what Future Pinball and Visual Pinball X has to offer before sinking big bucks into this hopeless title OR at least wait for a sale to get the season packs half off.Until the UI mess and some of the other glitches are fixed, I'm done buying tables.

												I tried this game because a good friend liked it a LOT.  In my opinion, this game is terribly inferior to Pinball FX2.  It has good physics and offers 'original' pinball machines but the gameplay, for me, is ridiculously inferior to Pinball FX2.  The 'season pass' prices are high, just like the competitors, and it will cost you a LOT of money to own all the tables available.  The same thing goes for the 'other' pinball games.The pricing is not where the fault lies.  It's the actual gameplay that I didn't like.  Don't take my word for it, download the FREE table and also download the FREE table from Pinball FX2.  Play both and decide for yourself.			"

												Boring, god mode 'physics' make this a video game and not a simulator.  Mediocre, at best, visual and audio fidelity.  Shame because they've hogged so many great pinballs.  Devs ignore community and never add desperately needed features and options.  They also don't bother to fix numerous age-old bugs instead opting to add new tables until that runs out of gas at which point they will abandon it entirely.The icing on the cake was a recent UI update which replaced an (in retrospect) acceptable UI with a dirt cheap, cynical, generic tile grid piece of ship.  This product is actually going backwards.If you must still own it, buy on deep sale only just for a quick nostalgia fix because real pinball play is not here.			"

												I have been playing this game on iOS, Android, and PS4 for quite some time. The PC version of the game is competent, but doesn't run as well as I would expecton my PC (6700K/GTX1080) in DX11. For the price, however, I would expect better performance.

I am lucky enough to have a Pinball museum within driving distance to my house, and I have played many of these tables in person. These tables are good approximations, but you can't really say ""Well, a real table would be $7K, so $7 for a pro version is a good deal."" This is software, and its price does not correspond to its quality, especially without crossplatform play.

Even if Pinball isn't your thing, it might become it, the first table is free, so there is really no reason to not try it out for the heck of it.

												I'm having fun playing The Twilight Zone on this table, but mainly because I have access to the real table and it's fun to see it on the computer.Unfortunately there are a couple of fatal bugs in the game's feature ""Lost In The Zone"" mode where afterward the game is unable to load the balls back into the ""gumball machine"" so the plunger is flooded with 3 balls at a time until you reset the table. It doesn't even recover on the next game without resetting the table. Another fatal mistake is that the multi-ball modes don't reliably auto-launch balls into play. Many of the balls that should be auto-launched are simply dropped to the manual plunger which is distracting and actually changes the gameplay.Beyond the flaws in the table I've played the game suffers from extremely predictable physics. There is no randomness in how balls are released into play so it is very easy to predict where a ball will settle when introduced into the table.I recommend this game to anyone who is looking to play a specific table that they know this simulator has available. If you simply want a fun pin ball experience there are better alternatives out there.			"

												There’s a nostalgic attraction to the concept of digital preservation - and the craft involved with an elaborate pinball table is an art. Leading the charge for commercial video pinball sim, Pinball Arcade seeks to emulate authentic tables as closely as possible.A digital platform, the base package includes (depending on version) either 1 or 4 real life tables of historical note. New tables are added in packs of 2 as they’re recreated. Farsight has done a good job of mixing older tables with new; simple but groundbreaking boards such as Black Hole are represented along with relatively modern bombastic crowd pleasers such as Medieval Madness. A strong aspect of the package is well-explained rule sheets with visual aids. If you thought pinball was sheer randomness, and never knew most tables have an intricate sequence of modes to activate for huge jackpots, Farsight’s respect for the game is contagious.The only downside is a fundamentals-first ethic, leaving the presentation with the look of a cheap iOS game even in the console versions. Farsight intends to update the front end, but it’s a drag compared to the virtual arcade hangouts in the developer’s earlier generation Pinball Hall of Fame collections. Still, the play is what matters here. When at the table it’s the next best thing to owning a real machine.			"

I love the game so much I find it hard to find fault.If I had to pick holes, there is the whole weird business of spending extra for the Pro setup which offers absolutely nothing of value whatsoever.  Also, not all the tables will be to your liking as they have a wide mix, and its unlikely all of them will be to your taste.But really, this game is fantastic.

												This is the only current game on PC that simulates actual physical pinball tables, and it does it well.   I highly recommend Pinball Arcade for those ""purists"" who don't love having a bunch of cartoon characters dancing around the table as you play.  The physics are entertaining but not as accurate as some rabid fans might suggest and I truly hope Farsight further tweaks them.  Occasionally the game will get weird with ""helium ball"" or super slowdown where everything including sound & music runs and stays at around 1/4 speed.  These things will right themselves after restarting Steam.Another issue on my laptop, which has Intel integrated + Nvidia dedicated graphics, is that Pinball Arcade's configuration utility only recognizes the integrated graphics.  Performance is still fine, but the flipper has about a 1/5 second input lag (really bad for pinball) which can be somewhat alleviated by turning off v-sync.  Hello screen tearing!  On my desktop PC that only has dedicated Nvidia graphics, there is no problem.Hopefully the promised upgrades (already in use on PS4 and Xbone) will be added to Pinball Arcade soon.08/16/2016 Update-  Performance has actually worsened considerably since I first typed this review.  It seems that with every patch, Pinball Arcade has worsening extreme slowdown issues making it unplayable for me.  Both Pinball FX and Zaccaria Pinball are quite smooth but not Pinball Arcade.  I guess I'll have to upgrade to compensate for sloppy programming...			"

												Free to play* * = one table is free, all the other tables, in order to enjoy you must pay. On any other table than your free table, if you hit the LOWEST highscore, the game ends IMMEDIETLY, not after the ball, not after your game. The INSTANT you get the lowest high score, the game ends and says ""to continue playing, please pay""This wouldn't be too bad if it didn't cost so much to buy them.			"

												Since the latest update the Star Trek pinball is useless. The balls are not moving on the table as they used to be, they go out of the table on the right side more easily and same between the arms. I have to kick the ball at a different position to reach my goals. The game became very annoying since the update. I am not enjoying it anymore. I would not be suprised if people are downloading the pirate version. They do not want to pay even 1 penny for crap. Sorry.			"

												To be honest, I'm not sure about recommending this game. I just played the free version with ""Arabian Nights"" being the only table. I'd like to play more, but I think the price for new tables is too much. A new set of tables is about 30 € and that for a game I'd only play while waiting for friends to come online.But the other tables play nice and I have tested some of the extra content, which has some creative additions. So I give it a thumbs up, though I'll stick to the free version.			"

												Beautiful Game,great physics, you get one free table.the others are limited and are over priced to purchase.i can't imagine paying that kind of money to play. the graphics music and game realism is wonderful.Instead of a Free to Play, it feels more like a trial version. and in order to unlock the whole game.... well lets see 5 bucks a machine... and there are about 125 machines... so this game would actually end up costing well over 500 dollars to unlock all of the tables. lol... that's crazy. i would consider paying maybe 1 dollar a table, definatly not 5...

												The best pinball game out by far. The game plays like a real pinball machine and less like a computer game like the others. These tables are all the real tables recreated. Physics in the game are spot on to real life, or as close as you are going to get. I played other pinball games and the the ball feels like it floats and moves unrealistically.

												Possibly the best Pinball simulator I've ever played with real life pinball tables accurately recreated in virtual form. Many classics are represented here, but their library is still small at the moment. The Steam store page is a little misleading as the actual software is free with only one table included. The rest of the tables require micro-transactions which come out of your Steam wallet. But the tables are mostly cheap and this is a great program for playing classic Pinball machines on.			"

The free game comes with a full table to play with (Arabian Nights), that is very enjoyable. You can then buy extra tables at a price, with 2 new tables added every month (the game now offers more than 40 tables!).Highly recommeded, just download it and enjoy.			"

The eventual bugs from pinball machine are also emulated because of this. It's also all real pinball tables. No fantasy magic handling and characters popping on the table kind of game.The PC version has extreme graphics. Too bad they ""weren't able"" to join the buys from android to PC...			"

												I think that PA should be subtitled Game of Drains. I've never played pinball tables where the ball drains so frequently. Its almost laugable, or it would be if I hadn't paid for the first three seasons.I've played a number of the real life tables that the PA tables are based on. The accuracy of the physics isn't even close. For example, Taxi - a very enjoyable table in real life. The shots that are challenging in real life are easy in PA, but sometimes the reverse is true. Launching the ball in the PA version is a joke, if you get the hang of it you can max out your score every time. Which tells me there isn't a real physics being used, it is faked, and it isn't faked well.Some tables drain the ball with incredible frequency. Tables like Whirlwind, a table I enjoyed playing and did quite well with  in other versions. I'm sure people who take their pinball really seriously will say I'm just useless at pinball. I'm definitely more of a casual gamer when it comes to pinball, but I shouldn't have to be an expert to enjoy PA. There are a few tables, very few, that are well emulated in PA, tables such as Funhouse.For anyone who is a casual pinball player I would strongly recommend pinball FX2 over PA.			"

												The look and feel of this game is great - however there's a very common crash on it that completely locks up your computer and forces you to log out of Windows.The tables seem to be rather expensive, but I guess that's understandable considering they are licensed products.Overall, a very promising pinball game let down by some fatal crashes and a very poor UI that exhibits some odd behavior. If they decide to patch the game and make it more stable, it's worth a go. I would hold off until they have addressed these issues or you're going to get pretty frustrated - especially if the game locks up while playing the intensely annoying version of Pinball Wizard over and over again.

												Played this game to death on the Vita. I prefer authentic pins over fantasy-ish pins where lots of stuff appear on the table which can't be done on an actual pin (Sierra's 3D Ultra Pinball series, Pinball FX 2, etc), although I still play those pins sometimes. Aside from the Pro Pinball series, TPA is one of the best pinball games I've ever played, especially when you consider all the tables were digitized from actual real tables. That brings me great joy, as I never once went to the arcades when I was younger and thus have never played any of these pins. I am happy there's at least one company out there willing to keep the legacy of pinball alive.			"

												If you ever liked playing pinball then get this. Buying all the tables is expensive but finding a table you used to play at the local arcade brings back many fond memories.Just to clarify, the game is not free. Only ONE table is free and the rest you must buy.			"

												Great idea to bring back the classic tables at a fairly reasonable per table price when purchased in season packs. Sadly this pinball simulator falls flat due to the lack of good camera angles. The only static top view is an unnaturally low angle to the glass making it difficult to accurate gauge the trajectory of the ball. It is sad that with so much effect put into the realistic simulation of the classics is crushed by such an easily fixed issue like camera angles. I am a big fan of pinball, but I am not a fan of this simulator.			"

												This game is great if you love playing pinball just know if you want anymore then the 1 free game they give you it cost between $30-50 for each dlc giving you set amount of machines but make sure that if u want all the games you buy the pro packs or else you will have to spend the extra $40-50 to get the 10 machines you missed if you bought the basic pack. overall i think the game is ok if you are really into pc pinball but as it sits without dlc might aswell not waste the time downloading this game and stick to ur windows pinball.

												Claims to be free to play but stops you in the middle of games asking you to buy it. Only let's you play free trial version. So not really free, at all.Plus the extra tables are hilariously expensive, £20 for 1 table?

												Played this game to death on the Vita. I prefer authentic pins over fantasy-ish pins where lots of stuff appear on the table which can't be done on an actual pin (Sierra's 3D Ultra Pinball series, Pinball FX 2, etc), although I still play those pins sometimes. Aside from the Pro Pinball series, TPA is one of the best pinball games I've ever played, especially when you consider all the tables were digitized from actual real tables. That brings me great joy, as I never once went to the arcades when I was younger and thus have never played any of these pins. I am happy there's at least one company out there willing to keep the legacy of pinball alive.			"

												Can't recommend this at all. It's not free to play. It's a demo. The game has fairly good reproductions of a decent number of tables and if they were free to play on, things would be great... but they are not. I am told there's a new free table every month.... never found one. There's only one table I can find that you can play for free.The rest of the tables have a score limit applied to them. exceed this score...and that's it, the game wants you to buy a table pack to continue. This would be ok if the score limit was set to a reasonably high level... but in every case, it's set so low that you don't even get a chance to determine whether the table would actually be one you'd be prepared to pay for. It takes almost as long to navigate the clonky menu system than the game itself will run for.Essentially, think of this as a film. You're sat in the cinema, you're munching popcorn, there's been a few trailers, the lights dim, the words ""filmed in Panavision"" appear on screen.... and then the film stops, the lights come up and someone immediately tries to sell you the film on blu-ray based on what you've seen so far... in the form of a box-set, bundled with some other films you've not had a chance to check out properly. These boxsets, they're not cheap either. I'd pay a couple of quid here and there for some of these tables, 20 odd quid though for just a few of the total available... no way.Basically then, greed has completely ruined this game. "

												If you've ever wanted to own real pinball machines but just didn't have the cash or the room for them then this is definately the one for you. It is nothing short of a work of art and nostalgia plays a big part. There really is something about playing on tables you have actually played in reality. Personally though I can take art or leave it. And in comparison with FX2 as a COMPUTER GAME Pinball Arcade is not going to please such a wide audience. The difference between the two is comparable to a top level flight sim and a  very good, playable, air-combat game. It depends exactly what you want. Some have complained about the price of the table packs and that it is listed as ""free"". I disagree - there is a lot here for your money IF real tables are what you are after and the fact that you can try them all for free makes its claims perfectly valid. 89%			"

												I've played this game a bit on Android and have been looking forward to a version on PC since the experience on a tablet is limited.I think it looks good. Not great, but good. Sadly, they chose to use the same user interface, which I think isn't very good. Particularly not on a big computer screen. While the graphics are vibrant, there's something odd about the zooming/scaling causing jagged edges. I saw this on Android too. Anti-aliasing might help a bit, but still. Lastly, I wish they sold the tables as DLCs through Steam instead of in-game.Anyway, this is the only proper pinball game on Steam at the moment. If you like pinball, you can't do much better.I'd recommend checking out Pro Pinball too though, which have gotten a bit old, but are still very very good. They are also remaking them eventually.

												I just love pinball games and Pinball Arcade reminds e of when I would go to the arcades at the local shopping malls. I would recommend this game for all lovers of the pinball era. There are so many great boards and I am playing Season 3 boards. So many great memories are in these boards for me!			"

												Not a bad game for a time-killer and just to have some fun. The tables wonderfully varied, and the goals are often a good challenge. However, if you really want to get serious about a top score, or completing all the challenges in one go without having to worry about hitting the limit, then you will have to pay for each table. If you are looking for a game to just play around with that is free, and you don't care to much about scores, this is a good game for you. But if you are looking to dominate the game entirely, be prepared to spend some money.			"

												Some tables are a lot of fun, others are terribly frustrating. But what's even more frustrating is the totally awkward user interface.Some things work ok with keyboard, others don't. Mouse is teleporting all over the place. Keys aren't always responding when (trying to) enter initials. The Enter key itself is hardly ever working correctly unless using the mouse at least once.Scrolling through a large list of tables is a nightmare since scrollwheel support is as good as nonexistant.. well, they did try and it IS doing something, but not what anyone would expect. So that's even worse than nothing. And on top of that, every time after leaving a table, the list resets back to the top, making you do the whole 'scrolling' part over and over, again and again. I've had more fun reliving some of my nightmares for days or even weeks on a row.While it could have been a fantastic game, the experience is ruined completely by a user interface which is horrendous on an intergalactic scale.And the strangest of it all is, they have promised a new UI about a year ago. I mean a FULL YEAR! And it still isn't there! How hard can it be? Yet, they are releasing table after table. So they are either ignoring all these issues on purpose or they've absolutely no clue about proper UI design.Shameful.			"

												The UI is terrible and unsightly, the music and sound effects are of strangely low quality, the graphics are very subpar all across the board, there is only one free table, and to get more tables costs a ♥♥♥♥-ton more money than they'd ever be worth. It's absolutely ridiculous. On top of it all, these ""exact recreations"" of real-life pinball tables (the entire gimmick of this game) are complete let-downs. These tables seem barely realistic at all and the physics and responsiveness are very wonky as well.All in all, it screams ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port job (of a game that was already kinda ♥♥♥♥♥♥), and it is a shining example of the free-to-play business model being used shamefully terribly.There are other, better pinball video games out there which, despite not meant to be recreations of real-life licensed tables, nail the feel of pinball better and with night-and-day difference of video game development craft and quality. Go play Zen Pinball or Pokemon Pinball or Sonic Spinball or Metroid Prime Pinball or 3D Pinball for Windows: Space Cadet... Those are all much better pinball games than this. Pinball FX2 and Dream Pinball 3D are some other ones that are actually on Steam as well, and, although I have never played those, odds are that they are much better than The Pinball Arcade here. It honestly wouldn't be that hard a feat to accomplish. This game is an insult.If you want more details and the specifics for how and why The Pinball Arcade sucks and is garbage, this is a pretty spot-on review from another fellow on Steam:http://steamcommunity.com/id/stavrosthewonderchicken/recommended/238260/ "

												Wow, this game has seen ZERO improvements over the original iPad version I played years ago! The graphics are pretty bad (well, tablet quality really), but most importantly the ball physics are seriously off. Is this the best you can do, FarSight? You claim to be the ultimate accurate sim of real-life pinball machines and you can't get the physics down, after years of development? Take a look at the Pro Pinball series which still hasn't been matched in terms of ball physics. What we have here is about as accurate as a real pinball table covered with ice. I've owned and played actual pinball machines for a decade now and I can tell you that the ball should *not* go across the table at 45 degrees when I plunge it from the tip of the flipper. It should go *up*; not to the side! This makes aiming impossible if you're coming from real-life pinball. It's funny, the Future Pinball project had the exact same problem with ball physics. I wonder why...Not to mention the poor and unrealistic sound effects used for the mechanics; these too seem awfully familiar from open source community attempts at pinball simulation from ages ago... you couldn't get a real machine and an audio tech to sample it for you? I've been waiting for a properly simulated real-life pinball machine on PC for as long as I've played pinball, but it seems impossible to do right judging by this effort.From an experienced pinball player in real life: not recommended.

												Having played the Android version, I had high hopes for this game. I was not disappointed. The graphics are excellent, the physics are outstanding and there is Xbox 360 controller support so it get high marks on the playability fronts.On the bad side, if you purchase any pinball tables for one platform, it does not translate over to the others. If I had been Farsight here, I would have had the tables connected to the e-mail address and allowed for cross-platform ownwership, but that may be difficult to implement. Not a REALLY big deal for me, but it could be a deal-breaker to others.Oddly enough, when I did the review on Android Play Store, there were three tables that I was hoping would be released: Addams Family, Cyclone and Xenon. And my wush was granted with Season 4. This is such a big thing that, except for original tables made by others, the standbys Visual Pinball/VPMAME and Future Pinball are no longer on my radar.An excellent game indeed.			"

												I recommend this game with caution.  It's a very novel idea--it allows you to play numerous real life machines in about a 6/10 or 7/10 enviornment.  Why do I rate it so low?  The physics.  The good news is that we're far beyond the early 90s where multiballs just pass through other balls.  The bad news is if you want a 'real' experience, you'd be best to look at the Pro Pinball! series by Empire Interactive from many years ago.Examples of differences between real pinball/this game:  Flippers don't have the same hydraulic movement that they do in real life--many tricks you can do because of the motion of the flipper are altered or not possible (drop catches for one).  The playfields have no dings / scratches / variable friction (Pro Pinball series actually simulates a 'worn in' machine to your liking) so the ball will travel in a pefectly consistent manner.  Flipper power is inconsistent--I've never seen a machine in my life that had flippers so powerful on Star Trek TNG.  There are very very few solid physics simulations on top of good gameplay for pinball machines.  It's basically the group that made monster's fair + the pro pinball series, followed by everyone else.  The pinball arcade belongs in the group of virtual pinball machines I'd definitely consider playing and are better than 75% of those out there, and loosely just as good as another 15%-20%.  It's not that 5% though and that's why I'd not recommend it.  Try it--make sure you're happy with what you're getting before shelling out the dosh.  It's enjoyable and can be a wicked fun night of nostalgia.			"

Flipper power is inconsistent--I've never seen a machine in my life that had flippers so powerful on Star Trek TNG.  There are very very few solid physics simulations on top of good gameplay for pinball machines.  It's basically the group that made monster's fair + the pro pinball series, followed by everyone else.  The pinball arcade belongs in the group of virtual pinball machines I'd definitely consider playing and are better than 75% of those out there, and loosely just as good as another 15%-20%.  It's not that 5% though and that's why I'd not recommend it.  Try it--make sure you're happy with what you're getting before shelling out the dosh.  It's enjoyable and can be a wicked fun night of nostalgia.			"

												If this game was sold with a standard business model I would suggest it, however as all free to play is a rip off... tables are way to expensive and as apparently no money are invested due to the business model focus on rip of people the game is pretty unstable. A positive side is that tables are well made and a few of them are from iconic arcade models.If the developer will issue the game with a standard business modle I would be happy to busy the game, not spending over 100 pounds for a game, I think this free to play things has to stop, go and do this things on mobile devices!

												99% of the games are HORRIBLE, ball goes right down the drain without even getting to play. I have no idea why the programmers would do this. I used to play ""Big Shot"" as a kid, but its nothing like the real game, ball always winds up down the chute, one way or another. The second issue is that they make you buy the ""pro"" edition if you want to alter the game at all, and to be honest, it doesn't do anything, the other settings it doesn't even let you change unless you obtain some ridiculus objectives, but because the games are so difficult, you can't ever obtain. I bought the whole first season and only 2 of the 22 games are worth playing. Forget about buying the ""pro version"" what a waste.			"

												Eight Ball Deluxe is rubbsih. The real table is a game of skill. In this simulation, the table is far too steep, reducing the game to a mere game of chance, as the ball goes out far to readily, and it is more or less impossile to catch the ball. Further, there is no option to control the slope.			"

												Have a whole lot of love for classic video games and pinball machines and Pinball Arcade has rejuvenated those feelings in a major way. Have bought Seasons 1 and 2 on my Vita, Season 1 on Steam (will get to Season 2 when the budget allows), and have backed all 3 Kickstarter campaigns that have been run. Even though I own a Twilight Zone pin and can play it any time I want to go in the basement it is a blast to fire it up while I'm waiting on something to come through at my desk. Having played plenty on the machine itself I can't say enough good things about how accurately they've recreated the experience and feel digitally, plus everything simply looks beautiful. Between this and Pinball FX2 I'm actually now planning to slowly work on a digital pinball to play it all in style. Having toyed with the emulation scene versions in the past truly has made me appreciate the great work that has gone into this game. If you love pinball this is absolutely the best way to keep it alive and share it with a new generation.			"

												This is a basic review. The game has stunning graphics, quality sound and funky music to each pinball table theme. The game has a ingame store which means you only receive one table for free, the rest you have to buy. The price of the content is moderate of $5 each or buy the whole season which holds more than 20 different tables. I'll give this game a 8/10 judgement considering the effort put in the game. The physics is stunning and realistic. Enjoying to relive my memories with this game.			"

With pinball arcade its like haveing the dream of owning a pinball arcade without the hassle or breaking your back carring that big hunk of pinball metal down your basement and back up when you got to move. Save you rback and break your wallet back a little bit with some of the classics. Also may i reccomnd geting the pinball pack with crazy gofers best pinball arcade worth your moneysworth haha.

												OK, first some background information. I am not a hardcore pinball player, neither am I a casual one. I am somewhere in the middle.At the time of writing this review, I own all the Season 1 tables. I also own all the tables by Zen Studious, a rival pinball company from FarSight.To be honest, I enjoy playing pinball from Zen Studious than from FarSight on the PC. The reason being, the tables I played from FarSight just does not feel right. Mind you, in real life, I have never played these tables from FarSight on a table board before. The controls just does not seem to feel right.However for all the Pinball enthusiasts out there, I would recommend this to them as well. There is no doubt that it was fun playing these tables from FarSight. For the casual players, I would recommend them to try the tables from Zen Studious. So I would give this game a hesitant recommendation. If there is a button that says ""Neutral"" on this review, I would most definitely click that.			"

												The problem with this game is the way it's marketed. It has been from the start.Let me be absolutely clear from the start: this is NOT a free to play game. In it's ""free"" form, you are playing a demo table, and if you want to get down to playing several tables you have to start forking over money - and quite a bit of it, too.The ""DLCs"" are not additions to a full game, they are the bundles of tables per ""season"" that you would otherwise have to buy individually. You can play ""trials"" of tables you haven't bought yet but they will slap you in the face the moment you actually score decently on them (can't finish a game - you're given the choice ""buy now or quit playing"")i.e.: Free-to-play part = game DEMO. DLC = game.Then, the actual gameplay:The menu system looks like it's been thrown together by amateurs, is very nonresponsive to input, clumsy to navigate, and there is no steam integration whatsoever.The actual simulation is decent, with proper recreations of table layouts and features of the pinball machines offered, although it lacks the responsive feel and proper physics I've seen in other pinball simulations on the PC. You'd think that in 2013, they'd be able to get physics down as accurately as it gets, but no, not in this one.Graphics: very hit and miss; seems the programmers like excessive amounts of bloom lighting, which actually provides a handicap and makes things ugly. Some of the textures used (especially in the surroundings) are simply poor and blurry. Camera angles can be odd, too.All in all, I don't recommend it, even for pinball enthusiasts (I'm one, loved playing the hell out of the real deal, lots of nostalgia looking over the lineup) - it's just too poorly executed with trying to push it as if it was free to play, and simply lacking in what you'd really expect from something with all the big names on them.

												I Love Pinball games. Arcade, Digital, it doesn't matter I love it all. Unfortunately, this game has graphics so bad you can't make out parts of the machine. There seems to be input lag between pushing the buttons and the flippers working, and It starts you off with only 1 table to play on, making you pay to open up other tables. Now, the pay as you play feature would be fine, except it forces you into buying tables by season, as opposed to choosing individual tables you want in your collection. Given how low quality the graphics are and how poorly this game seems to have been put out, I wouldn't recommend it, even to the Pinball junkie like myself.			"

												Don't get me wrong, Pinball Arcade is a good game. But I didn't like it for a multitude of reasons:-It took 8 hours to download, so I had the bar set pretty high for the gameplay. All computers differ, but nonetheless, it greatly affected my experience.-I am a completionist, so...that there are 168 achievements is very annoying.-It was glitchy, and when it wasn't, I easily mastered the one Table that is free.-Speaking of which, yes, you read that right, one free table! That's it. Then you have to buy the rest.So, once again, its a great game. It revives old tables and whatnot, but for the reasons listed above, I don't recommend it.

The annoying thing is, that there is a trial avaible for the other tables but with a score limit insteed of a game limit, so that you aren't aible to test them cause most end during the first game. Mentioning that the tables are only avaible in a pack then odd, it is like to buy a pig in a poke.So my resume is, the free table is good but the rest to expensive with this conditions. "

												I have decided to change my review. I've gotten a lot of fun out of this game. But I wish there was a middle of the road option. Even if you enjoy the game, doesn't necessarily mean the game is as good as it could be, with even small changes. I found out the game is locked to 60fps, which means if you have a nice high frequency monitor, then it's useless. And it's a real shame too, because there are other pinball software options out there that allow you to use high refresh rates and it's really awesome and helps the game feel immensely better. This is especially frustrating on tables like Black Knight which are so fast that it can be hard to even keep track of the ball on a 60hz monitor (and it happens to be one of my favorite tables). This is fine in real life, because we have 3d depth perception and 'endless' fps effectively, but on a monitor at 60hz, it's really difficult to play. The other problem with this game is that it is clearly made for consoles. The menus just don't work well no matter how you use them. And certain tables under certain configurations seem to constantly crash the program. And, when used in portrait mode, it isn't compatible with 16:10 monitors, it ends up cutting off a rather imporant section on most tables: the flippers. So I like pinball software. It's a fun quick way to spend some time. And between recommending this and not recommending it, it's hard for me to choose. I think PinballFX2 gives you a much better bang for your buck, on sale or otherwise. In part because the tables are designed to be played on computer. But also because of all the options, smoothness of UI, and pricing structure it offers over this. But I still enjoy Pinball Arcade and recommend it to all the more hardcore fans of pinball.			"

												I was browsing the free to play games and came across this little thing of beauty. I've always loved pinball, but never got to play it too much because quarters don't actually grow on trees. The only thing I was disapointed with is that in order to play any of my favourite games, I have to actually buy the season packs, which even during the steam summer sale, are more than $20. Hopefully they'll miraculously go on sale at some point and I'll be able to snag one for a decent price.But I suppose if you're willing to buy the extra packs, this game would be pretty flawless.

												I love this game, I am not a huge fan of older machines, but this game has a nice mix. Nothing will actually replace a real machine, even making a cab for this would not replicate the experience on a real table. I have played quite a few of these and will say I am impressed with the ball physics, there is still alot of room for improvment, as the machines play way differently than they do here, but its a great game and provides hours of entertainment and is a challenge in its own right. As others have said its as close as your going to get to real pinball without the machine. I also like that these are indeed real tables, and not made up. It would be nice to be able to challenge my friends, and not have to set my desktop to be portrait before i launch the game to view in portrait mode, and it desperately needs the directX upgrade they have been talking about for awhile, but I am always excited about a new table coming out. I own all 3 seasons.			"

												A lot of pinball tables for your money so plenty of variation, not sure how many exactly but it works out at around €1 per table. Some of the tables are very annoying at first, but as you get used to them they become more fun. Strongly recommended for anyone who likes pinball games on their computer. If you are not certain you can download the demo - gives you 1 free table each month which you can play as much as you like, the others can only be played up to a certain score.			"

												The game does an amazing job remakeing the old tables all the way down to the right sounds and music, but it does have a couple flaws. Graphicly it does not have nearly the same polish as zen pinball tables, with a lot of artifacts and jaggies, and the ball launchers seem to be an all or nothing affair that it decides at random. While i am still giving it a recomendation i feel those two issues need to be adressed before i say it for sure is a good buy.			"

												I love this game, I am not a huge fan of older machines, but this game has a nice mix. Nothing will actually replace a real machine, even making a cab for this would not replicate the experience on a real table. I have played quite a few of these and will say I am impressed with the ball physics, there is still alot of room for improvment, as the machines play way differently than they do here, but its a great game and provides hours of entertainment and is a challenge in its own right. As others have said its as close as your going to get to real pinball without the machine. I also like that these are indeed real tables, and not made up. It would be nice to be able to challenge my friends, and not have to set my desktop to be portrait before i launch the game to view in portrait mode, and it desperately needs the directX upgrade they have been talking about for awhile, but I am always excited about a new table coming out. I own all 3 seasons.			"

												Pinball Arcade is a Godsend.  While pinball emulators have brought new simulated tables, simulations of Bally;s, Gottlieb, and Williams machines is amaze-maze.  There are even Stern tables!Nothing beats sinking a day's worth of time on Monster Bash.  With the Wizard Goals, achievements feel natural and goals I actually care about.  Buy season passes so you can choose from many tables.  I even played for free on Tales of the Arabian Nights for quite some time.  There are still machines I haven't tried on my season pass because the value I get from Scared Stiff, Star Trek: The Next Generation, Attack from Mars, and Monster Bash.  (Yes, this means I haven't tested out Twilight Zone nor Medieval Madness!)Things I'd like to see:- Strobe Multiball on Attack from Mars is not too strobe-lighty.- Some lights don't activate for me, like Creature Feature on Monster Bash.- Phantom Flip on Monster Bash doesn't temporarilily light Alive Again, like on the real machine.I would recommend, because now, ""I can get it while I can,"" at any time!

												For those who enjoyed playing on a pinball  machine as a kid, this game does deliver when it comes to gameplay. I do recommend trying this game out. The only downside is the in game transactions. Yes the game itself is free however to get the additional tables, you must purchase them one by one or as a pack.They do give you one free table. Tales of the Arabian Nights to try out! The way they built back up these tables electronically from their physical originals, is astounding. The replay value is amazing (at least it was for me)! Each table comes with it's own set of achievments and standard goals to accomplish. However if you purchase the pro pack you will get an additional set of goals called ""Wizard Goals"" that are very advanced and difficult to achieve, after you accomplish the standard goals. Once you complete all the goals, you unlock some special features such as custom balls, unlimited tilt, etc.. Each table also comes with the history of it as well as A FULL explaination of the entire table. From values of bumpers to helping you complete the main goal of the table and achieve the SUPER EXTREEEEEEME JACKPOT! The instructions are very clear and concise, BUT there is A LOT and i mean A LOT of information to go through. Luckily, they separate the instructions into different categories for you to navagate through.The only cons i have are that, sometimes the ball does get stuck and the ""call matience (i know i mispelled that)"" does not work. Which means that you will have to reset and start over. This can be especially frusturating if you've gotten very far and this happens. That is really the only con i have with this game. I've run into a situation where i can't navigate back to the table menu after a game is over, but that has happened very very very rarely.In conclusion...try the game out and the Arabian Nights table! If you love it! I recommend purchasing Table Pack One Pro to start with! ******IMPORTANT NOTE!******This game is also available on the iPad, iPhone and PERHAPS Android, i really dont know about Android. HOWEVER! If you purchase table pack one on the PC and table pack two on your tablet or mobile device...YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RESTORE TABLE PACK ONE ONTO YOUR MOBILE DEVICE FROM YOUR PC! The company recognizes this as two COMPLETELY seperate sets of transactions! This means if you want both packs on both devices...you will HAVE to purchase both packs on both devices!That is all!Have a great time!			"

												This game is a dream come true. I absolutely love the Star Trek: The Next Generation table, playing it whenever I could in high school, so the Season One table pack was a must buy for me. As someone who can't afford a real table yet, these collections of famous and historical tables is an incredible value. Plus, they take up MUCH less space in the house!Edit: After playing for a while longer, I wanted to update my review with a caveat. I still love the game, and find it a beautiful recreation of the physical tables...but...it is occaisinally buggy, and the dev team doesn't seem to deploy fixes very often. I have only run into one game breaking bug on one table (Funhouse), but other, smaller bugs which have been identified by the community, remain in the game (looking at you, Arabian Nights top skill shot).The tables are expensive and don't seem to go on sale very often. If you like pinball, however, and can put up with a few bugs and long times for patches, then it's worth an install - at least for the free table.			"

												I remember playing Pinball machines as a kid. My cousin even had Big guns in my uncle's home, before it was moved out of the house for reasons i don't know. then i went to see my other uncle that i don't remember anymore before we head home. but before that, we stopped at one more RV camping site where there was Stargate the 1994 pinball machine, another pinball machine i don't remember what it was, and a few arcade machines. i also remember playing williams pinball classics on the PC and i don't know where it is now. but what i do remember were the tables i played. Arabian Nights, Black Rose, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and Lost World, i believe? Three of which were not by Willaims at all, but by Bally As i figured out recently. But playing Pinball Arcade as a Free to play Title, all the memories of my childhood playing pinball comes back, but with more tables i never played but intrested with they're own features. My favorite was Cirqus Voltaire for its creative designs, gameplay, and so on. As a Run in the middle pinball Apprentice, i was getting my on a few steam wallets to redeem them and buy a few tables for my pleasure and to see how much fun i had. for hardcore Pinball Wizards, i'd recommand it that much. Give it a try, can't be that bad. The tables perfectly interpretate the designs of the original physical models, digitized into our computers for us to enjoy.			"

												If you ever had an old favourite real world pinball machine (from the first to the last), this aims to recreate them all, table by table!P.A is free, with one table free, and you pay microtransactions to get each new one (about $3 - not bad when you know that it was $1 to $2 a game on the real deal!), with ""Seasons"" of tables added to every so often.(Three Seasons now, S3 just started.)There's some big names too. Star Trek TNG, T2, Elvira's two pinball machines and many you may not know (same as me) but will enjoy anyway (same as me)!(Bride of Pinbot, Medival Madness and Tales of Arabian Nights are pretty challenging! And the last one is the free starter machine!)And all machines you can try for free until you hit a certain score (which stops play).You can also customise the ball among more things!And all I needed was a simple Core2Duo!AND it's controller enabled, and works great! Using XBOX360 controller, triggers for flippers, left stick to bump the table, A to use the plunger (or right stick for older ""pull the stick"" style ones!).HIGHLY recommended!			"

												Plenty of nostalgia here, waiting for Addams Family table but other than that this is well worth a download.  I bought Season 1 and it's been well worth it.  Attack from Mars and Medieval Madness are two of my favourites, but I'm trying to get better at the other tables too, Monster Bash and Elvira being others.Basically, if you like Pinball, you'll LOVE this.

												This, for me is the best modern way to play pinball through the ages. They craft the tables to be accurate and fun. This game allows me to have many tables from the past all on one app. I would love to see my purchases reflect across my other devices like my mac and ipad, but I understand the logistics in getting that done will be a big problem.This game is definately for the pinball afficianados with out all the hassle that Visual Pinball or Future Pinball has. The simulation is almost perfect and the graphics are also close to perfection. I would like to see some more 'next gen' lighting effects coming into play. And I know it is a small nitpick, but I would like to see the room in which the pinball machines sit, have more detail.So a wonderful game that will give you more joy than you know what to do with.

You have Funhouse (hard table but very fun), Taxi, Space Shuttle (I'm real good at it),  Pinbot (yes the one that had the NES game), Bride of Pinbot, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Star Trek, Whirlwind (my favorite table) and The Twilight Zone which is most regarded as the best Pinball table ever made. Give it a try, You can play a trial version of every table and you get one table free. 9.5/10, A, 3 and half stars.			"

												I happen to love pinball, and the sad fact that the arcades in my city no longer carry them, well, it makes me sad. If I were paying quarters for these games in rl, I would have spent much more than what the Season one pack was worth. So a great purchase for me.  All the greats are here and I can't get enough of it. The tables look great and it brings back fond memories. If you love pinball, you can't go wrong with this. You will probably recognize quite a few like I did. I haven't purchased Season two or three yet.			"

												This is a GREAT game on mobile... unfortunately, the purchased seasons and tables DO NOT transfer over between platforms (ie. you get to buy them all again). I'd love to have it on the PC, buy I'm not ready to spend (essentially) double-the-money, just to play it on both.Overall, the table emulations are pretty good, and fairly accurate ... though I sometimes get the impression that they didn't fully pllay-test them all (or, well, actually play the *original* tables, themselves, prior to releasing the digital emulation). And, yes, the tables have some bugs (eg. The Bride of Pinbot can inexplicably change the camera angle on you (to the plunger view) if you drain a ball during the ""safe period"" when multiball starts, causing you to likely lose every-other-ball on the playfield). Though, they also *do* go back and fix older tables, from time to time.			"

												First to get the really low stuff out of the way:It's unacceptable that the tables are locked by a pretty low highscore. Image playing good, you have a run, suddendly BAM: Pay 4,99 or gtfo. and I have to say 4,99 for two tables and 16,99 (i gess it was this high, was busy rage quitting) for al the season tables is way too much. There are four seasons, and 16,99 for every season?! That is more than a new game! and for a Pinballgame, that's way too much.Still I have to admit, the tables are beautiful crafted, the sound effects are on the spot, you really feel you would be standing in a bar or an arcade and play one of them. It's a game for fans of classic pinball machines. A must have in that case. Still the prices to unlock are way too high			"

												I love Pinball Arcade. So many great tables are here. I actually have more fun playing TBA than playing real tables. The real thing is usually broken, the sound is turned off, or it's in an location where there's too much glare or you can't hear anything.The physics are pretty good, except it seems a little slower than in real life and it's really hard to hit the far left and right lanes on some tables. Using an xbox controller works great. It defaults to the analog triggers where you can hold it halfway to activate just the lower flippers, and pull the trigger further to activate the upper flippers. This allows you to be able to capture and hold balls with a flipper while actively using other flippers during multiball. But you can always change the setting to the bumpers if you prefer that. Xbox controllers are preferred because you have that digital/analog choice as opposed to PS3/4 types of controllers with their purely analog buttons.The DLC isn't that bad $30 gets you tens of tables depending on which season you buy. Seasons 1 and 2 have more tables because the development costs have already been offset by sales of console titles Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection and by the Kickstarters for Star Trek, Twilight Zone, and Terminator (pleeeease bring us Adams Family!!!).I know in Season 3 they had Diner, Cyclone, and Earthshaker in the works. The plebs voted for Diner so I don't think I'll see my favorite table Earthshaker in 2014 :(Anyway, love this game. It's well worth it on PC since you can rotate your monitor 90 degrees and play in portrait mode. There's no ""cabinet mode"" yet, but they said they're working on it.			"

												Pinball Arcade features some good reproductions of Pinball classics like Bride of Pinbot, Twilight Zone, Elvira and The Party Monsters, and others. While I'm not a fan of the old school tables, I do see the point in adding them since they're a part of Pinball history. The only thing I wish is for the option to buy one table at a time from the earlier seasons insted of being forced to buy 2. Pinball Arcade is worth checking out if you're a fan of pinball.			"

												At the time I'm editing this review I've put close to nine hours into playing with Pinball Arcade.   I'm having an absolute blast so far.Honestly, all I cared about with Pinball Arcade was getting the Attack on Mars table.  I adored that game as a kid, and it still rocks as a young adult.  Playing it again is such a delicious rush of nostalgia for me.  Several of the other ones I've tried, Arabian Nights, Star Trek, and Medieval Madness are pretty awesome too.  The attention to detail in recreating these tables is staggering.However, there are some potential drawbacks I've encountered too.   These weren't deal breakers for me, but they might be for others.  First, the choices for camera control are minimal.  This wasn't a problem for me because the default angle of the camera is pretty much what you'd get playing at the arcade.  But compare this to Dream Pinball, for example.  Dream Pinball had six or seven different options.  If I wanted to follow with the ball I could.  If I wanted to the camera facing more directly downwards, I could do that.   If you don't like the default angle with this simulator you're out of luck.  Second, if you want individual pinball machines there are some inconveniences in your way.  I actually did not know that I could buy individual tables at first.  I thought they came in either smaller packs or seasons.  As of right now, I can purchase a single table if I want.  The price is $4.99 for a single table or $7.99 for the pro version which includes additional options.  However, I have to buy this in game with Steam wallet funds.  My guess is that this is because it would be ridiculous creating individual steam pages for the dozens of pinball tables.  A lot of people may not even be aware that they have this option, so keep that in mind.  Also, $4.99 or $7.99 may sound a bit steep for a single table.   I will say that the ""pro"" option in my opinion is customization that should be available in the base game, not stuff that should be hidden behind a paywall.  If it was just $4.99 for one table, and you could customize it then I think people would be a bit less annoyed about it.   However, I ask you to consider the alternative.  I haven't seen an Attack from Mars machine in YEARS.  I could travel hours to find an arcade that has one, and then pay dollar after dollar.  Or I could shell out $7,000 dollars and have to store and maintain it myself.  Or I could pay a measly $7.99 and have all the customization options and have access to it forever.  All in all, I will unquestionably get my money's worth and then some.  However, it all depends on how badly you're hurting to play any of these tables.  If you buy the season at a discount, which I did, then your average price per table goes down drastically.  I'll probably upgrade the few tables I enjoy the most to pro and pretty much ignore the rest.  The last potential negative point that I will mention is the ball physics.  I personally did not notice anything wrong, but I know that there have been some negative comments about that from people who were experienced with pinball machines.   As an ordinary consumer who just enjoys pinball now and then, I can't really address concerns that hardcore fans might have, so you should probably read a few negative reviews just to get a balanced perspective.  If you're squeamish about trying pinball arcade, then let me set your fears to rest.  You can try Pinball Arcade for free.  When you download the free platform it includes trial version of ALL the tables.   So, all you have to invest up front is enough time to install the game.  Try it out, and find out which tables or seasons might be worth your money.  I'll conclude this interview with a brief and very sincere thank you to the developers.  You have brought a piece of my childhood to life that I'd never expected to get to experience any time soon, if at all.  I really appreciate the work you're doing, and hope to see more familiar machines on your platform.  Now let's kill some Martians!			"

												On the whole, this is a great simulation of some really awesome pinball machines from mostly the 80s and 90s. On the upside, if you have a reasonably decent computer you should get tight, responsive gameplay. You wouldn't think a pinball game would be very graphics-intensive but you are going to need a moderately robust system for rendering the more sophisticated tables, not to mention the physics engine.  There's a wide selection of tables to choose from--over 40 tables at the time of this writing.  The downside is almost all of them cost extra--a ""season pass"" will cost you $30 and there are 4 seasons so far. You can end up spending a ton of money on this game if you so choose, but you do get one table for free, and the one table included is a pretty good one. (You can also buy individual tables for $4.99, or $7.99 for the ""Pro"" version, which allows you to muck with the table's settings).I have a couple gripes, though. First, I'd like to see more tables from the 60s and 70s.  There are lots of these older tables out there and while they may not be flashy, they're still a lot of fun to play and offer their own unique challenges.Second gripe is I've found the menu buttons can be somewhat buggy.  They don't respond very well to mouse input and in some cases foul up completely (such as when entering a high score).It seems silly to compare this game to the other big pinball game on Steam, Pinball FX2, as both cater to different things. Pinball Arcade seeks to recreate tables that exist in real life in order to preserve them.  Pinball FX2 on the other hand takes advantage of the fact that it is a video game, and thus creates utter fantasy tables that could never exist in real life.I'm lucky.  I have access to a MASSIVE video arcade that has hundreds of classic pinball machines and arcade games (search Coin Operated Gaming Hall of Fame and Museum on Google and you'll find the place), but when I can't get up there, I can always fire this up.  Mind you I'm no Tommy Walker, but I can play a mean pinball just the same.			"

												Pinball is something I was never really interested in, as initially I thought it was just hitting a ball around a table hours on end trying to score points with no real object. I was very wrong and naive to think this as there is a lot to these table than meets the eyes. These pinball tables more specifically the newer ones with the dot matrix display tend to have a lot of missions and trick shots to complete in order to gain a larger amount of points in a quick succession. Though don't be fooled as completing these missions/ojectives are a lot harder than it seems. My favourite table at the moment is Monster Bash, it has a great theme, nice look and the sounds are really great, it has the arcade feel to it. The idea of the Monster Bash is to light every musician on the table to start the Monster Bash multiball. Lighting the musician's instrument requires completion of the mission/mode of that particular musician, e.g. completing Frankenstien's mode will light Frankenstien and his instrument the keyboard. Completing all the musicians and their instruments gives you a wizard mode called Monsters of Rock which is a multiball mode with higher jackpots than the Monster Bash multiball. You can find rulesheets online if you're unsure how each table is to be played. The game has a good replay value as you're always going back to try and improve on highscores and if you have friends who play it, more the reason to be competitive. If you're friends don't play this game you always have the Global Leaderboards to compete with. They are always updating the game with new tables which is good, the developers are active and are continually improving the game. The graphics seem fine, they could be cleaned up in some areas which I can see are improving on the DX11 version. The game has a nice solid feeling to it and does actually feel like a real pinball machine which offers that realism that makes it that more enjoyable. One thing is for sure mastering the technique of `tilting` is highly required if you're going for endurance and points. The good thing about this game is it allows you to trial everthing before you buy it, so I recommend the game as you can try it and if you don't like it, nothing is lost.			"

												***update***  ok i played a few tables and started the challenge had a great time.  i racked up something like 160 million on ripleys believe it or not. it took me all day well 5 hours or so taking breaks. i would pause smoke a cig return play more lol. but i saved the game and decided id take a screen shot and omg the score was gone!!! top score just vanished and not something ill likely do again. then i decided to continue the saved challenge game. guess what its gone and is making me start over again. i still recomend this game i am just warning you there is an issue and one that shouldnt be, given the age of this it wont be fixed either. coulda just been a fluke i havent seen this complaint but it happened to me. so youve been warned.***update*** physics of the ball are kinda weird but again about as good or better then most. my only complaint is its hard to trap the ball. no reason not to try this game as the physics are on par or better then any other pinball game. i only wanted to adress this issue because so many complained about it, again if your that anal about pinball go find one in rl and be happy this is a video game and no pinball game in video form will ever have true physics.so i got bored of shooting zoombies and wanted something retro. i looked up zen pinball fx2 and was annoyed at the new tos. then i downloaded pinball arcade and i have to say  it is one of the besst if not the best pinball game ever for pc.i do not understand the negative feedback on this game. of course the physics are not right and will never be right. its being played on a pc where multitudes of things can happen causing slowness ect. the lighting of the tables is just fine and unless your standing over an actual pinball table the view will always be off on some tables its to be expected. so if your that much of a perfectionist go find a real pinball game and play that and stop the negative comments lol. over all this game is in my book 10/10. from  real tables the history of each table to the play and replay ability. of course its not perfect and like i said never will be but this brings it as close as one would want... yes id pull the plunger again			"
