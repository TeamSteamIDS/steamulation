												Boring.This is a boring game, which feels like you're pulling 3-4 levers every few minutes to see what happens.  As background, I like and enjoy complicated strategy games.  Some of my favourites are the Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis series.  I also have sunk many hours into the political and dynasty aspects of The Guild series.  I like these types of games.  I saw a preview and was excited at the idea of a ""mayor simulation"" with some background politics and influencing political parties.  Sounds like a fantastic idea for a game.This game is none of that.1.  You'll see a lot of negative reviews with respect to the town planning.  I can appreciate that it is not a city builder.  It wasn't meant to be; however, town councils (county councils), etc have planning offices and engage in town planning.  This is nothing like that.  It's very basic, akin to what you'd find on a mobile phone app.  You select a district and you can only use % to determine whether it's industry, business or residential. You don't select where the individual neighbourhoods are.  So which ""blocks"" in your district are I B or R, is really up to the game and not you.  This is a weird design choice.  You put some important buildings, eventually, like police station or courthouse and you can wire it up for gas or sewers, for example, but this is mostly done by just clicking a ""tick"" and hoping the council agrees with you.  It's very basic and not at all enjoyable to watch your city grow, because you've had little to do with it.  This is the opposite experience of the town planning aspect of ""Banished"" for example (which is rather fun to watch the town grow.)2. You don't create your family.  Yes, this was discussed in the previews so this is only a minor criticism.  Yes, they said it was pre-scripted.  It's worth noting though, that when they say pre-scripted, they mean it.  It has so-called 1000 dynamic events, but none of this really seemed like it couldn't have been done without creating your own family and style.  CK does it.  Anyway, doesn't matter, just poorly thought out in my opinion.The families you choose are typical tropes.  So you have the villainous and cruel aristrocat party, which of course has ""von"" in the name.  You've some weird stage-irish sounding name and that's the family that's all into working class and unions.  You've the mysterious Russians and then you've a family that's all about science.  How many science dynasties have you read about?  Anyway, it's just trope and as bad as it sounds (the specifics of the families, as in how stereotypical they were actually going to be, was not in the promos.  It's worse than anything you've read.)  I find this to be an immersian killer, your opinion may vary.3.  The political parties in this fictional town are irritating and seemingly pointless.  Yes, they sit on the spectrum of conservative/liberal and right/left and some mish-mash inbetween.  They have histories that you won't care about.  They are name.  You won't interact with any party leader, for example, as everything is abstract.  Most of your interactions will be with three buttons.  ""Plead/Demand/Threaten"".  That's it.  You click one and then a dialogue menu comes up.  Once you click one, even if you don't like the dialogue, that's tough.  You have to make a choice of the options, which is 1-2, 1-3, or sometimes 1-4.  What the options do, seems to be an arbitrary mystery.  Sometimes the tooltip popup says, most the time it doesn't.In any event, it's bizarre.  Let's say a topic of Child Labour arises and one of these parties puts the edict to outlaw child labour before the council.  You will get a pop-up that essentially asks if you will support or oppose this edict.  Let's say you pick oppose.  You then will contact all the political parties, through those 3 aforementioned buttons.  Here's a great example of a lazy design choice...I'm opposing this.  I want the edict banning child labour to be voted down.  YET all my interactions with the political parties will ask the parties to vote YES.  Like one of the options is ""YES WE NEED THIS"", where I am actually saying ""no"".  If you click it, it behaves like you're asking them to say no and the sliders adjust accordingly, but the actual strings that appear lazily still have the positive messages.  The whole game is like this, which makes it a pain to play.  So I'm asking the parties to vote no, but all the options are telling them to vote yes, but when I click on them it behaves as if I was asking them to vote no.  Clever huh?The interactions are very abstract.  You can bully them, but it doesn't do anything more than move a slider.  It doesn't feel like I'm being a jerk mayor or hard-line bully.  I don't feel like I'm Mayor Daly from Chicago.  None of that.  It's abstract.  The way the numbers work, everything regresses to the mean, so as long as you're not constantly a bully, you're swiftly forgiven.4. As a mayor/political sim this is the most boring game I have ever played.  There's nothing to do of any interest.  It's just tedious.  It tries to insert child-like humour into an otherwise seriously presented game.  I hate that when developers think that's clever.  Certain developers can pull it off, such as in Fallout or Baldur's Gate, because it's cleverly done.  Here's an example:-I'm trying to get an edict passed, and one of the threats to the conservative party is to say to them ""Agree with me otherwise you'll be known as the conservaTARD party.""  Classy.5.  This feels primarily like running a business sim on a phone app.  It's cosmetic and veneer feeling.6. Nothing you do is very exciting.  I pressure the council to try to get a train station built in a pre-determined location.  They say no.  I wait about five minutes and I ask them again.  This time my bullying suceeded.  Uhm, yay?  It was seriously just clicking a couple buttons, with no actual strategy or interest.   You're bullying a nameless and faceless lever.7. Eventually one of the parties will have a split and you'll have the ""old"" and ""young"".  They don't really seem to remember how you treated them before.  As I said, everything regresses to the mean.This game is worth maybe €9.00 for value, as a mobile app, in its current state.  Maybe DLC will fix things, but I'm not sure how, given the design, this could be made more interesting.			"

												2/22 edit: The image of this game sums it up. ""See all these buildings? That's what Cities: Skyline's has. As for me? Ehh..."" He's doing some sort of given up expression. It sums up my thoughts on this game entirely.Man, where do I even begin with this game?I wanted to love it so much after watching Youtube videos and playthroughs; this game looked amazing after watching several hours of them. Sadly, I don't think I've ever been burned as hard as I have been with this game more than any other game I've ever preordered in my entire life, including Spore. Yes. Including Spore.  I've tried to give this game some breaks, but...Let's bulletpoint this.1: Any resolution other than your native monitor resolution and the game will dull the colors immensely. Also, forget trying to play this game at anything above 1080p, because you'll get graphical errors that make all of your buildings white and blue. Also, kiss any framerate stability out the window, despite owning a GTX 1080. It's been three weeks since release, and no fix. Unexcuseable.2. You feel like you have no control over anything, that everything you do doesn't matter, and by the end, you stop caring. You can see there's this whole economy ticking behind your industries and businessess, but you can't decide to help paper or barbershops directly or anything of the sort. You just place huge districts down and hope things work out. City council edicts are just passive boosts to your entire city that you just idly click on to make things easier.3. I really must stress the lack of control. What does heavy traffic do to harm your city? Don't know, because unlike Cities Skylines it just gives you vague 'maximum traffic usage' numbers. How does it damage my economy? What can I do to make lumber or movies a better industry in my town? No idea! A lot of the time you're just waiting months to do minor adjustments to districts for... boredoms sake?4. Your city looks boring as heck. Roads? All grids. Industries? I guess film industries, car factories, and lumber mills all look the same and I just didn't know about it. Don't you remember when film studios had smoke stacks? I sure don't! So forget having any major control on how your city looks, or putting it on a hill, or anything of the sort. It's just flat land. Remember Germany being flat? Guess we're in the Netherlands now.You know, I could go on, and on, and on. About how the music repeats every ten minutes; how you really have to zoom in on max settings to even see people walk about; how despite the cool as heck technology tree is broken because you can be 30, 40, 50 years ahead of modern tech if you abuse it. This game made me not care about my city, what I was doing, and why I was doing it. That's the nail in the coffin for any simulator. I just don't see anything they could do to fix this game. It's just... not fun. And it depresses me saying that. I wouldn't recommend this game, even if it went on sale from 40 dollars to 5 dollars. It just feels... like some major spark is missing. Cities Skylines absolutely destroys this game, and still stands as the best city builder to date. Go get that, and like two hundred mods, and watch a day pass by. Oh, and they aren't even sure this game will get modshop support now. Heck, Tropico 5 is still an excellent choice for those who want something more local and flavorful. To me, I should have bought the new Skyrim instead of this. This is literally, the biggest disappoint in gaming in years to me. I wanted to love this game... but I can't. The concept screamed epic, the execution... souless.Updated this review 2/14/17, since a lot of you liked it, apperently.			"

												This game is a great political simulator.  No matter what you do, you feel like your actions aren't making any difference.			"

												20 hours and multiple victories in.Urban Empires is an okay game. It seriously lacks depth once you bite into it and the developers didn't really put much attention into making sure that multiple play styles are competitive. At the end of the day the ""best"" move is to just go fully socialist liberal since almost all related edicts are totally positive anyway. I'm willing to bet that the overwhelmiongly positive effects that liberal and leftists edicts give is at least partially based on the developers own political opinions. There should be multiple feasible paths to victory even if you don't agree politically. Such a shame really.Gay rights? Yes. Feminism? Of course! The bonuses are too good to pass. Same for child labor, women's rights, LGBT rights, etc. Rinse and repeat. I get that many of us support these things in real life but in a game each choice needs to have benefits and flaws. The game rewards progressive ideas by removing all flaws.Furthermore the political parties are nothing more than a simple resource system. They have no agency or personality of their own. The other ""players"" in the game lack any sense of reason behind their choices. They don't have any clearly seen agenda and this hurts the game immenseley. Yes liberals are more likely to vote for more taxes and conservatives are more likely to oppose them but that's as far as the depth goes. My last point focuses on events and the world at large. As you play, diffferent events come to pass on the world stage but ultimatley it doesn't matter what you do or how you react. It always plays out the same way with no real consequences for choices or outcomes of events. It doesn't matter if you support independence or not because at the end of the day it all disappears without explanation when you move to the next era. I didn't even realize we got independence until I saw some random screen with a reference. It didn't even matter. This happens with every event tied to the larger world.TLDR: The developers hit on a great concept and if the game was 10 bucks I'd say they nailed it as far as liberal progressive SJW style games go. At 40.00 dollars we deserve far more depth and far more meaningful choices/options. Leave your politics at home and just focus on making a good game please devs.			"

												As someone who has played 11 hours on this game, had three different campaigns and basically got all the ways to win, and get a victory I must say this game still has must work to do.It's fun, half-way in... The tutorial is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, and the RCI demand is a lie; Keep building districts and make sure you keep an eye on taxation, I cannot stress this enough. Like the developers have hinted, this game is NOT a city-builder but rather, a city-ruler type of game, a new type of sub-genre for strategy games and I think this is a great idea, this game also adds an interactive and engaging storyline for each one of the houses, if the engine decides to give you those events...------------------------------------ More in Depth ↓ -----------------------------------Politics: the Politics in this game are utter garbage, a left-wing ""CONSERVATIVE"" party like the communists will support increase taxation for lower-class members and less taxation for upper classes. FDP are just a nuscane at the beginning and there is no way you can play this game in a ""Conservative way"" as the game FORCES you to progress. I think the political system is just shallow and lame, needs much more design.. for example the political compass should be Authoritarian - Libertarian (socio-economic compass) instead of Conservative-Liberals. I would also suggest to the Developers to add a ""trait"" system to parties, which will hinder their like to vote for-or-against different legislation so we don't have commies voting for INCREASING CHURCH FUNDING. Anyways, yes, the politics of this game are engaging but this feels more like ""Barriers"", these parties have no life to them.Novel/story: The story is interesting, and as I said earlier, if you're lucky enough to get the game to give you them.. Sometimes it doesn't, and you start out with a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ruler or you don't know anything about the ruler except what the game gives you every era... Happened to me in Era IV/V. The von Pfilzens are interesting, and so are the Kilgannons, probably my favorite families to play in this game.City-building aspect: now I know this is NOT a city-builder but a city-ruler but it does have the city-building element to it, and frankly, its shallow and lame... Its not engaging as I thought it was, you don't have much say in how different grids and spreads are choosen aside from the ""Change the spread"" of a district thing. Going through Eras it becomes a general burden to upgrade your districts, the game offers no ""total district"" change stuff, so you have to keep changing infrastructure and roads manually which usually ends up being rejected-or-accepted depending on the parties in control. I wish the devs would put more focus on this aspect and the politics as they did on the story.Invention (AKA RESEARCH): The research part is smart, its cool and its engaging, I love it. There's not much to say, I think this is where the game excells in. Different research/inventeions give you different edicts, upgrades and unlocks new stuff (But by Era IV theres nothing new to unlock really except for upgrades).Engine & Sound: Sound is great, music is great. Engine, I heard people have had crashes, and that sucks.. I have only experienced one when transferring over to Era V, that's when it moved me back to Era 2 for some reason and It crashed... The game in graphics really lacks, I have a GTX 1070 that can run ARK and other games in probably the highest-res and so on (on 1080p and probably 4k) but somehow this game makes sure that my FPS is below 30 and constantly lags, drops or some other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Like damn, fix your stuff Rebel.In short this game had potential, still has... I am not sure what went wrong with the devs, but I have to unfortunately give this game a 50% rating, and this is coming from someone who has 11+ hours in the game and got almost all the victory achievements. I would NOT recommend this game at its current stage, and I fear for the worse; that Kalypso and Rebel Media plan on adding and fixing a lot of these issues in over-priced DLC's...  (Current rating is not recommended, will change if patched and changed over time).My message to the developers; Please, do not make this a DLC-expanded game, fix your issues and patch the game up before any DLC's!Anyways, this is my take on the game... Feel free to add me on Steam if you'd like to hear more about my pro's and con's in regards to this game, or if you'd like me to help you out with strategy and development of your cities (If you bought the game).

NOT QUITE THERE (YET)I love city building games.  I love politics.  I should love Urban Empire.Urban empire starts wonderfully exciting.  To start, it has open territory to place your districts, a council to influence, and support from the emperor to get you going.  The game remains fun while you create and grow your first couple of districts and through the entire first era.  As the game goes on each era becomes more and more repetitive, and the errors in and problems with the game become more apparent.Based on price and experience, for now, I have to give this game a thumbs down.  However, it is my sincerest hope that mods and patching will really improve both the primary experience and the replayability of Urban Empire.  I want to love the game, and I think I can if they take a good hard look at what city building combined with politicking can fully offer.WHAT I LIKE1.  The premise of growing a city through political wrangling.2.  The option of the families; though I wish there were a few more of them from which to choose.3.  The politicking of the council and the parties.WHAT I DON'T LIKE1.  Decision tool tips:In many cases there aren't any tool tips.When there are tool tips: I don't need the game to say, “If you click here you will get a 5% bonus to X.”  I don't like static numbers in a game that's supposed to be based on humans and politics; however, there should be a tool tip that states, “If you select this option you should see a small boost to your economy.”(Additional note:)  After which you may see a -1% to 5% modifier to... whatever.  Put some small/subtle human nature/failure randomizing to personalize it more.  We already have failed assassination attempts, why can't we have false math (aka: spin). 2.  Fluff/story-based decisions out or order - (notional example, but consistent with the point):1850:  Your baby is born with a disease, what do you do?1855:  Daddy tells you to get married.1857:  You get married.1860:  You have no children and this worries the city.1861:  You have your first child.3.  Replayability is lacking.  In my experience:Progressive agenda issue (for the era) proposed multiple times, even if vote fails or overruled.  Conservative policies (for the era) are one-and-done.  This makes it very difficult to play the von Pflizen family true to their lore.  Both the council and the populous should be a bit more randomized every play though.  Maybe one time I play and the city leans toward liberal policies, and the next time they are more puritanically religious and conservative.  This would allow for more replayability.  All families should be able to win based on their ideals.  Populist or Liberal Western ideals shouldn't be the only path to victory.  If I want to run the city as a Facist, Communist, Republican/Tory, Democrat/Labour, Green, Pacifist, Libertarian, Anarchist, Theocracy, or whatever I should be able to.  When I played as 'me' the game was basically on easy mode.  When I tried to play a role, I barely got past Era III each time; and always failed in Era IV.I am NOT accusing the developers of having a political bias, but my experience is that populism and generally liberal policies make for a well functioning city.  It's a self-imposed hardmode to play any other way. 4.  Lots of lag at endgame.Whether it's on the city map or even in the city council starting in Era IV the game becomes very, very laggy.  There's no point in even moving the camera over my city unless fully paused, and waiting 3-5 seconds for a button click to register is not... ideal.5.  Bad spelling grammar:I'm not too worried about this, and I'm by no means perfect, but it should be noted that they could use a better English editor to fix the numerous spelling and grammar errors.

												Pretty good game, but not yet great. Only on my first playthrough, but it scratches a lot of the itches I have in gaming. - It has a simplified citybuilding part, which I welcome as it has a clear place in the game.  - It has political simulation. This is also a bit simplistic at parts. You basicly buy votes with goodwill, there is not that much to it so far, if you have enough goodwill, you can swing votes in your favor, and goodwill goes to a default state which depends on you general standing in the city. So far I haven't done anything in particular to make this good and I have not had any problems getting what I want. I will update this review if it turns out that the system is deeper later in the game. - It has dynasty building. I love this, you have choices to make about your son, who you get to play later. - it has a pretty large research tree with narration when something is discovered, a bit of Civilization feeling. So to me it seems it has elements of Sim City, The Guild, Civilization and Crusader Kings. I don't think they are just mashed together without thought. I think they work just fine. I only have two complaints so far. The first is what I already said, the political system should be a bit more complicated. I just know when I've spent enough goodwill to get the vote, because it tells me how many will vote yes and no and so far there hasn't been any surprises. Everything is a bit simple, but that's not necessary a bad thing as the game has many layers and if all were complicated it would get lost in them. However the main attraction should be a bit deeper (unless it's depth is gradualy introduced, in which case as I said I'll update the review). The second is technical. I wish it was possible to increase drawing distance. I don't have any technical problems or glitches, it works fine, but objects dissappear very soon. I'm having fun so far, hope replayability won't be a problem. So far, recommended. (To be honest, I thinks it's too early to review at all for anyone, but already the ""I play on an abacus and it crashes after a few minutes"" ""reviews"" popped up, and it's a much better game than to deserve failing due those, so here is my honest opinion after a but more than an hour.)Update: It really starts to get much better in the 3rd era. It is now kind of democratic, you are elected and have to fight to stay in power. Your council is also elected, which makes it possible to attack your problems with them from different angles. For example in my last term I had a really hard time, I made some bad zoning decisions and the town was bleeding money. By the mayoral elections we were deeply in debt. To remedy this until the unused zones get back in shape I tried to raise taxes, but the freedom party and the communists always stopped it, also making them my mortal enemies by the time the mayoral elections arrived. I was going to lose it badly, but I had one chance, I had a lot of dirt on those two. The communists were easy, at the first sign of trouble they yielded and gave me full support. The Freedom Party on the other hand would rather have me out them, but refused to cooperate, so that's what happened. I had enough of the goodwill of the other parties to win the election by a very small margin. Then another term went by, the economy was still bad, but the communists started to like me as we agreed on a lot of proposals. I still couldn't raise taxes, and I didn't want to use my goodwill to do so as the mayoral elections looked like a disaster. Then came the elections for the council, and the Communist party won big time. The freedom party however was reduced to almost nothing due to all the bad stuff that were revealed during the last mayoral elections. This gave me majority support in the council, so I'm still in game, the taxes are raised, so the budget is recovering and population is rising again. It could still be more complicated, but it already strikes all the right chords with me.			"

												This game is exactly what they say it is - a mayor + city STRATEGY GAME / SIMULATOR.  It's not really a city builder, and the reviews dinging it because of that are nothing short than people not understanding what the developers have created.If you enjoy strategy / simulator games and have always wanted to create a long lasting family dynasty this game is for you.

This game is a fascinating mess .. I really want to like it but I can't recommend it in its current form. And even if it worked as intended, it's far too expensive for what you get.(+) Genuinely new conceptIt deserves top marks for its ideas: it's NOT a city builder, but rather a political simulator in a city builder's skin. The whole game involves proposing legislation and taking it to the city council, where you employ political tricks to get what you want. This part of the game is immensely satisfying: working with or against political parties to get your laws passed and then seeing the effects of that in-game is what gives you the biggest thrill.(-) No cause and effectUnfortunately, almost every other aspect of the game needs major work. The biggest problem is the lack of clear cause and effect. Despite a very busy UI, you're never quite clear on what your actions wil do. The developers have defended this on discussion boards by saying it's a realistic depiction of politics, but this is a cheap cop-out. The fault lies in the confusingly messy and random UI which sometimes gives tooltips and sometimes doesn't, the badly translated stats  (e.g. what's ""sales demand"" or ""vote process?), and the lack of obvious links between many factors in the game (e.g. density and infrastructure). In addition, some of the events are downright contradictory: I sided with the progressive Young Swarelian Party to decrease taxes on students, but the legislation that was enacted increased said taxes by 5%.(~) Lack of polishSome of the game, e.g. the family/map selection screens, is beautiful; the rest is laggy and glitchy, even on powerful rigs. There's currently a very bad memory leak which results in major slow down in the latter third of the game. Even when settings are optimised, the main map screen looks dated. This would be much less of an issue if the gameplay problems were fixed.			"

												This game was a big disappointment to me. It had promise, but as it's done with the past Tropicos, Kalypso fails to deliver.First off, you are herded towards adopting certain decisions, you can say no and oppose, but it will eventually be brought back up and it will be more and more impossible to allow for a reform to pass. And if you look at these decisions with anything but a roleplaying or contrarian mind, you will have NO reason not to support them. The Von Pfilzens are traditional aristocrats, that's who I played as, yet when some reforms against my own ideals came up, I saw there were no downsides to them, it was all raw benefits. If there were any downsides, they were easily crushed by the potential benefits. So what did I actually get out of playing the Von Pfilzens instead of another family? Little more than their starting modifiers which barely did anything interesting as is.In Tropico games you had options on how you wanted to build your city, even if its consequences were limited. From a capitalist paradise, to a communist utopia, to a fascist dictatorship in the later games. You tended to go towards the communist path, but the choice was still there. In this game it is nowhere to be found.Second, what happens around the world NEVER affects what happens in your little bubble province/city of Swarelia/Kaisershafen. In fact, when you pass certain reforms the entire country you're in suddenly decides to do so too. Shouldn't the world be affecting me? All I get is some newspapers. The entire nazi war machine might just cross over Swarelia and I wouldn't even notice outside of one or two events and a newspaper telling me.Third, you are forced into a democracy. As ideologies like communism and fascism rise, you are still forced to get elected by the parliament in the 3rd Era. Not cool, in a game like this you could easily represent your rise to power through the two totalitarian ideologies and maybe do some politicking for the entirety of Swarelia to join up with you. Hell, at first glance you'd think they'd do something like this considering there are two families that literally scream fascist and communist in your ears. Now let's leave the wasted potential behind and look at the gameplay:It's boring and bland. That's what defines this game. When new technologies pop up you tick a new checkbox in a district and wait for the vote with 100% support to pass, do this for every other district all the time to keep it competitive. Lay down some dumb buildings to keep people's happy numbers up. They're not gonna starve or revolt, they'll vote you out if you don't do it right, so everything is fine.The politics game, well: Rack up goodwill points with parties, and when you want to get something passed you use one of three options to make them support the edict. Parties have no personality, no real members, they're just in a Left-Right Conservative-Liberal x-y axis which makes them support an edict or the other more. You'll always want to get the same stuff passed, since it's what brings in bonuses that'll keep the city afloat. You'll sometimes get events that pretend to give parties some character, but they are usually without real consequence, and will only give you more nice guy points with the parties, that's all.And yes, there is little else to the gameplay.To conclude: It's not a bad game per se, but it is in no way worth the price for it. It has no meat, and what little meat you can find is barely edible. This game would need a complete revamp to be entertaining for more than one or two hours, but knowing how Kalypso works after years of following their Tropico games, it won't happen.Have a good day and thanks for reading.

Urban EmpireUrban Empire is a game that promises to combine a great city builder with deep political roots. Does it stands up to its claims or buries itself in the ground, let’s find out:Gameplay:Urban Empire is a game which tells you about the game that it was meant to be, not the one it actually is right now. A game with good city building mechanics like Cities: Skylines and having deep political mechanics like Crusader Kings II has been a dream game for many of us. To some extent, Urban Empire is a showcase of such a game. It starts off with style and intrigue. You choose one of the four races which are going to rule the city. All four of them are given proper backdrop and their lore differentiates them from one another perfectly. One might be a dictator type civ which believes in forcing rules on people to run the city peacefully while another is one which excel with communicating people but are relatively newer in politics and  does not have much clue what is going on. These strengths and weaknesses of the four races help you get invested in the start of Urban empire. After selecting one of these races, you can choose who is going to be the leader of the family and who are you going to play as. Till this point, Urban Empire makes you care about these factions and their leaders but it starts to falter when it comes to actual city building.What we enjoyed about 2015’s Cities: Skylines and city builders of such quality are non existent here. Building and managing your cities are confined to some very simple mechanics . You place a district on the map, manage the cost it takes to maintain the district and bam you’re done. There is little to no customization about this aspect of the game, a thing which sticks out as an open wound. The cash flow you get for building these districts is pretty nice and you don’t need to worry about running out of cash until late into game when industrial revolution and such comes into play. The cities you build do not feel like actual cities which you built but more like cities which were made by themselves when you ordered. No managing of roads or actual in depth city building is present here.What is the saving grace of the game and more or less the selling point is the political system. It is far more deeper than the city building mechanics and offer some challenge. As you move further in the game, factions start to split up and cause mayhem. You can select how your successor is raised and how they control the dynasty in the next era. It is not without its faults though. While the political system offers challenge and inserts some character in its dynasties, it is way too repetitive. You cannot expect to replay the game and see drastic changes from your first playthrough. Political parties more or less behave the same and do not offer anything different. You don’t want to pay price for a retail game and then expect such short replayabilty from a game of a genre which is known for its replayable games. There are also some really long sections in the game where it feels like a monotonous affair without much achievement. The tutorial present in Urban Empire is also very short and does not introduces you to some of the major mechanics in the game. While Urban Empire has an interesting political system, just do not expect it to be on par with games like Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis. A lot of bugs and crashes also dampen the experience of the game. It constantly crashes to desktop or back to menu which deletes your progress constantly and makes it a frustrating experience.VisualsUrban Empire impresses with its visuals. From the get go, you are introduced to a clean UI in the main menu. The faction logos and leaders are represented really well visually and shine throughout the game. The cities are dense and full of small details. They look good and are vibrant in nature. Colours pop out at you while you building and managing cities and the events, while plenty, never clutter up the screen to provide a pleasent gaming experience.SoundOne Word: Excellent. What Urban Empire doesn’t show in its gameplay, it shows it in its sound design. From the ambient and epic soundtrack to the tense build up in the courts, Urban Empire provides solid sound design which compliments its visual design very well.Overall:Urban Empire promises much and falls flat. From the bland city building aspect to the somewhat interesting but ultimately repetitive political system, Urban Empire never reaches up to the hype it creates itself. If it was a game which was released for a cheaper price and less promises, I would’ve recommended trying it. But at a price like this, I expect more from a game. It needs polish and deeper systems. I would recommend getting this game at a sale where you can test it out for yourself but not in its current state.Pros:Intriguing political mechanicsSolid visuals and sound designCons:Bland city-buildingRepetitive in naturePlenty of bugsRating: 45/100This review was brought to you by SaveorQuit.

												As it stands the game feels fairly shallow, I appreciate it's hands off as you're a mayor but be prepared to spend most of your time begging the council to at least let you build a new district, if you fail that vote you get to stare at your one district with essentially nothing to do.Oh top tip, don't install basic utilites like street lights. It will econimically ruin the empire and you'll have to ask the Emporer himself for more funds. For your lamps.Wait for some patches and a price drop. This is a £15 game, not £35.Edit.To clarify, the game feels shallow as the political mecahnics feel almost meaningless. They seem to simply serve as a difficulty barrier. For example, if you are economically struggling, you need to build industry. To build industry, you need to ask the council.Council say no.It then doesn't offer up any reason as to why, job creation doesn't float any political groups boat for some reason.You then stare at the screen unsure of how to increase funds while the council do nothing. It's like the game NEEDS you to be hands on, but won't let you at the same time.Also, researching technologies unlocks new types of buildings, clothes shops for example. Yet you have no way to place these as it's a hands off appraoch. Meaning you just have to assume there is a clothes shop some where in the city now.Like I said, this game lacks depth. It's not horrific just don't buy it now. It will go down in price.			"

												I rarely review games due to extreme apathy, but I had to make an exception this time. I cannot recommend this game as much as I'd like to and I really would like to be able to. I loved the idea behind this, and as soon as I heard about it, I knew I had to try it. This is the sort of game I had been waiting for and I wish more developers would bring out games along these lines. I have, however, been left extremely disappointed by this developer and the game that has been released. There has been little to no reaction to the community response and there has been one or maybe two patches since release. Neither of these patches have focused on the big problems within the game. I've given it around 33 hours, and until a major patch gets released, I'm not going to give this game any more of my time. The numerous bugs and shallow game play are just not worth bothering with. It would also be nice if the game actually had tooltips and told you how to play.Reborn Games are going on my blacklist of developers I will avoid in future.			"

												After spending the last week playing this game, 42 hours in total, I have found the game to have some serious issues. The game economy is completely unbalanced. The infrastructure, like electricity, for example, has no positive net value in the long run and costs way too much. You end up spending way more money on infrastructure upkeep than you get back from benefactors (like industry) in return so the game forces you to increase taxes which kills city growth. The game also has issues with zone density. Increasing the density of a zone should not cost any money or have any upkeep, but the game developers decided that rezoning a district from light density to medium density should completely wipe out whatever funds you have saved up, with an upkeep so high that by the time the area deveopls with medium density and money is flowing again, you're in the hole 3 or 4 thousand (which is a lot in this game), and you're not making a whole lot more than before the rezoning. So the incentive to increase city density (which should be really fun to do), isn't there. In fact, it's the opposite. You avoid rezoning to higher densities, and that to me defeats the purpose of a city building game. I do not recommend this game unless the developers fix these disastrous gameplay issues.			"

												I got it on sale, but for $40? An overpriced boring game. 1) There's not much depth at all. Proven by the game manual of a few pages of things you already knew from any ""Lets Play"" videos on youtube. If you've seen one video on this game, you saw 100% of the gameplay besides late game eras. And no--- it doesnt save itself by then.2) The UI is clunky -- having to toggle between too many panels to do simple actions. 3) Use dense grid. Always dense grid. Theres no strategy in which zones to use. Infact, using sparse grids will cost you more by far  as you have to cover all that space with extra services. 4) For a political game, it misses the point entirely. Hell, its not even a politcal game. Its a voting game. Theres no real replay value to govern as liberal or consertative --- a tryannt or a benovolent hero ---- it all means the same thing. For example a liberal will want pass unions as much as conserative, just simply because its BUFFS all your services.5) Overpriced.Just for refrence on my current playthrough im a couple hours in, everything is passing without effort, and im sitting on my♥♥♥♥♥wondering what to do with my hands as a third of this game is paying attention to random events and picking a choice. Another third is researching tech, sitting on my♥♥♥♥♥ and picking what I want my lamps to look like. The last third is voting, and acting like you give a crap as you give a district some cobblestone roads for some enivorment boost. Yay.Now I can place a new district! Rinse and repeat.They should've just taken this idea of game and combined with a new Tropico to revitizle the franchise. So that way when Im bored out of my mind I can at least kill all the council members and actually have a game to play.			"

												A difficult game to review because it's very difficult to tell whether it's fun or not. It's also very difficult to tell just about anything happening in your city. I very much enjoyed the opening half-hour, getting involved in city politics, forming likes and dislikes towards certain parties that opposed the type of city I was trying to create, and unlocking different services for the first time.This quickly fizzled out when I advanced to era II and wanted to try to stimulate my industrial areas to provide taxes to further improve my existing districts, and I realised I had no idea how businesses actually work. Sales demand is counterintuitive (lowering it is...Better?), extra sales, efficiency, quality, and lots of nice other words that the game fails to explain the significance of. After some prodding, raising and lowering business tax and keeping track of the finances of certain businesses I've managed to work out the general gist of how things work, and yet I still feel woefully underinformed about what policies to implement regarding the industrial and commercial sectors, and consequently have little intution about what to build in my residential districts. Is the economy growing or shrinking? I'unno.Is my city business friendly? I'unno.Should I take steps to improve conditions for doing business, or can they handle a 2-3% rise in taxation? I'unno.And it's a game where information is key, half of the difficulty comes from an irritatingly unhelpful UI. Which is just unacceptable for a game considered to be in a finished and playable state. So, I'd suggest saving your money for now, at least until one of the great sages among us have figured out how to play it and post a guide, because it promises to be quite fun in the moments of clarity you experience from time to time.Grudgingly, 4/10.

												Squallmizza said it best ""So... I read the reviews and thought 'nah it can't be that bad'.It is. Believe the reviews. The choices you make seem to have very little impact and the causality of 90% of the statistics peppered throughout are not remotely explained. There's no mapping as to what actions favour which parties or inclination of any real difference to your character's influence around it.""It really REALLY is that bad. Don't buy this game. "

												This game is a fun take on city management. You don't have to micromanage your city building, that pretty much happens by itself. Instead you need to convince the City Council to approve your plans for the city. You need to handle the various political parties, choose to compromise with them or support one of them and aim to help them win the majority of votes. The political simulation is interesting, and the whole game depends on how you handle it. However, there are weaknesses to this system (more on that later)Also, newer buildings, laws/edicts and upgrades are unlocked through research and a tech tree. The tech tree seems a bit small I think. In 20 minutes gameplay I already went through 1/5th of the tech tree with only 2 schools built (schools generate research points among other things). Nonetheless, the way it's set up is interesting and has good potential for further development.A big part of the game are events. If you play any Paradox grand strategy games you know what I mean by events. Occasionally something will happen that will require your attention. You will be presented with a problem and 3 solutions (on average). It both gives flavor to the game and allows for roleplaying. It also lends replayability, as depending on your choices you will probably end up going through a much different story each time. Events can serve to introduce new laws and edicts. Further, each technology will give you at least one event while it's being researched, related to it.So far the game runs smoothly, no bugs or problems. It's a bit slow on loading screens, but that's not such a big deal.My main issue is that I bought this game because it promises a deep political simulator, but I don't feel it delivers on that. On the surface everything seems interesting and good, but once you get into it, problems start appearing. As advertised, for everything you try to do in the city (new buildings, tax reform, laws/edicts, new districts, introducing gas and electricity etc) you will need the City Council's approval to actually do it. The problem is that political parties hardly exhibit any intelligence. The main factor for their decision making is if the proposed plan will take your city's budget to negative. There is no consideration for projected profit. There is very little adherence to ideologies presented in the political spectrum.For example, the simplest problem: You need to increase your income. The best way to do it is to build new districts and increase taxes. Tax increases are suprisingly easy to pass but they are not enough alone to let you develop your city. At most you can support 2-3 buildings with a 10% increase in taxes. So you need to build new districts, but this projects a tremendous drain on your budget. With a school, a police station and an electrical grid, the running cost goes to -80K money. With 1 district already built, the best you can do is +20-30K income, for which you need to spend a lot of political power to get. Getting the Council to let you build a new district is nigh impossible and tedious. The only solution is to sit and watch your single district for some time, doing nothing, just so you can gain enough political capital to implement a change. And after that it's again spending a lot of time doing nothing.There are 3 stances you can take with each party (Plead, Demand, Threaten). Each one will give you some options on what you can do. It seems what each choice does is random. There's little apparent consistency or reason with each choice. Furthermore, whatever you click in this interaction, there's no going back. You can't examine your options for example. If you click Threaten, that's what you'll do. No cancel or go back buttons implemented.This wouldn't have been an issue if:a) There were regular methods to regain political power (goodwill) with the various parties and councilmen, instead of waiting for them to tick up. (For example, certain proposals, laws and buildings should be favored by certain parties by default, especially if they cater to their values).b) The parties actually had more detailed scripted behaviors and they took into consideration the gains each project would confer. (Almost everything is for the sake of money. My councilmembers apparently hate the idea of police stations, street lamps and hospitals because they aren't free).c) There was a way to bundle proposals together. For example, build a new hospital and accompany it with a tax increase to overcome the budget issues.My other issue with the game is that it doesn't have edge scrolling. Meaning you can't stick your mouse on the edge of the screen and expect the map to move. You need to click and drag with the right mouse button, or use WASD to move around. It's inconvenient and a weird design decision.The game also seems to only offer 3 maps to play on, and I don't see any way to randomly generate maps or create a custom game with a custom family. You can only play campaign or narrow scenarios. The lack of customization is disappointing to say the least.If and when these issues are fixed consider picking up this game. Without these problems I'd highly suggest it. It's otherwise a very fun game, with good atmosphere, well-done graphics, nice music, interesting mechanics and great potential. Until then, I suggest you wait a while and check back later.			"

												I wanted this to be a good game, but after 23 hours of playtime I can't overlook the big holes in it. Ultimatly this game feels like they have sorted the first era, but then ran out of development time/ideas so the other four an pointless and unfinished. Several of the core game mechanics feel broken and in reality this game isn't ready for release. This is an example of a great concept, implemented in the worst way possible and their is ovbiously more focus on getting a game out there to a deadline rather than creating something that worked. Kalypo should be ashamed of this and I will most definatly avoid thier titles in future.I was excited for this game pre realease seeing it as city builder meets mayor sim. In reality it fails at everything, and the cons kill any fun you might get out of it.Pros- concept (so wish they had implemented something that delviers on just 1% of this)- ealry game feels interesting (first 30 mins or so)- tech tree design and look- Concept of familty through several eras is niceCons- the game becomes repeataive fast, after you have put down 1-2 districts it reasearch, get things approved reaserach again.- your choices make very little difference in reality and after a while you get bored with it.- loads of data tab all usless (they don't help you understand whats wrong or what needs improving), just tabs of meaningless ifno.- political options are limited and no clear cause and effect.- money is impossible (raise tax and no-one cares, industry going bush with 0% tax rate???)- no matter which family you choose the game plays the same- no matter which map you choose the game plays the same- income changing for no understandable reason, and therefore imposible the take corrective action- once you get later in game and have to be voted in for 6 year terms. You spend all you time pushing this, and tech improvements make no difference- once you get mid game the game starts to lag badly (and I don't see why)- once you implement district infrastructure you can't dial back to save money, so have little options- Once your past the first era tech tree improvements have little to no impact.- decision made around how you bring up a child doesn't seem to impact in the next eraI dislike this game so much I have requested a refund (which is the first time ever). If you are thinking of buying this game don't.			"

												So this is another economic simulator by Kalypso. This one however, is different for a change than most of their others. The idea of being a mayor, and trying to run and build a city, while appeasing council members is a novel idea. It does cause plenty of frustration, when you are turned down on a proposal that will turn your city around from going to downhill, but that is life I suppose. The game has an advanced idea, but a very simplistic implimentation of the game mechanics. Once you have figured out the way the game does things, and why the council votes no on different things, which almost always comes down to money, the game becomes very easy. Being easy, doesn't mean it is less fun though.  I know I put a ""No"" for would I recommend this game, which is kind of weird considering I do not think this game is bad, nor do I think it has any game breaking bugs that makes it unplayable, and all the bugs I have seen are so minor, they are barely noticeable. My only issue is the monotony of the gameplay after an hour or so, and what happens in Era III going forward from there. I only played for like 5 hours or whatever, and I do not know if things change in the 5th era, but the problem in Era 3, being forced to use most of your party support to just get re-elected, instead of on proposals you support, create an issue with gameplay. You do no need to be elected the first 2 eras, as you are appointed by the Emperor, but in Era 3 you must run for election, and convince the council to vote for you, the same way you do for any proposal. I spent far more support for the different parties in convincing them to vote me back in, every 6 years, than I ever could in advancing my city. My city literally came to a stand still for anything the council didn't wholeheartedly agree with already.One top of this main problem, that I think needs some balancing to help players, I believe the game is not priced properly. This game should be $19.99, and at that price I would say it would sell two or three times as many copies, more than making up the difference in price they are charging, and I would recommend it to everyone. But at this price point, I think too many people would give up on the game after Era 3 and feel ripped off on such an expensive game. I really think these problems are extremely small on one hand, but too big for more to ignore, and recommend this game to anyone. If Kalypso were to get wise, and price the game better and adjust how elections are handled from Era 3 going forward, I would put this game above nearly all other city builder sims. "

												There's a lot wrong with this game that I can split into categories. MechanicsThe game is not difficult enough for hardcore strategy players. I mean, once you figure out that you don't actually need to improve anything, the game becomes pretty basic. Just slap down districts and a couple schools for brainpower. Rely on institutions and edicts to raise stats. You don't need to build anything else unless it's in the hard negatives.The political management means very little other than ""you can't do unpopular things' with damned little (if any) way of making things unpopular/popular. it's not like you can forge alliances against other parties or try and play people off against one another, and even if you did, it's not like you have to for 99% of the edicts you could pass. Essentially, there ARE a lot of weird mechanics here (districts, infastructure and politics) but you can safely ignore them most of the time, and it's not a really big deal. This is probably a good thing in the long run, since the interface for finding out what's wrong with your city are pretty bad (honestly, I think sim city 1 did a better job).Like, there's a ton of complicated rules for placing districts, but none of them seem to have much of an effect, and when they do, the tutorial and user interface are so opaque that I have no idea what the advatnage is.  Do you need to have residenital with your commercial zone to make it work? Maybe. Gas, electricity and water raise the efficency of companies in the district. How much? Dunno. Increasing roads reduces traffic, buying public transport increases ""transit points"". What do they do? ♥♥♥♥ed if I know. If this was something like a difficulty curve, it would be one thing, but a lot of this♥♥♥♥♥♥genuinely doesn't seem to matter, at all. The bonuses, for example, from sister cities don't seem to do anything. In the end, a lot of the game came down to doing nothing. By the end of era one I had 100 million stashed away, and had spent a lot of my time just waiting for the clock to run out or on pointless stupid council votes to add another district (which need a skip ability, badly).Narrative & Immersion The game sucks at it. The actual decision points are rare and far between, and have little narrative impact. There's very few story points in the game, with the major historical stuff barely qualifying as an an afterthought. Oh look, it's WWII. Oh look, the empire has rebelled. You don't interact with the other families or personalities in the city. You don't pick whether you side with the Axis or Allies. You don't have any big event trees to worry about. The parties are hilariously random. I've had hard right christians support abortion, communists deny worker rights, and pacifists who just announced that they adored me decide they didn't want me as mayor. I had researched video games shortly after the 1900's, apparently somehow running in a city that had a power plant but no actual electrical grid. Nothing looks different at any point, the game doesn't really feel very different from Era 1 to Era 5. The districts barely even look different. No one reacts to anything. At least in Tropico if I built something I'd hear a radio announcement on it. Oh look, I have hte first radio station in the city in 1850. Meh. Hey, I just put up a satelite in 1903. Woo.It all just reduces the idea of a Dynasty. The gameplay doesn't support the narrative, and the attempt to add story with writing is just miserably flat.Terrible OptimizationNot many, though late game, the whole game seems to slow down hugely, and I am not the only person who suffers from this. My computer isn't that old and the game's specs not that high to justify this level of slowness that occur once you get into era 3-4ish. x4 speed is absolutely required, and runs like x1 or x2 on earlier eras.In short, I'd only buy this at a deep discount, when hopefully this game's been fixed and content's been added. There are many strategy games that are cheaper and better than this from other independent companies. It's not a total disaster, but it's not very fun and certainly not worth $30.			"

TL;DR: An interesting idea for a novel genre that sadly does not manage to keep my interest.Urban Empire tries to mix story-telling aspects with city-building and strategic maneuvering in politics.I watched let's plays of this before release and I am not terrible shocked to find that the strategy part is a bit shallow and the city building is not the focus of the game. So maybe we should understand this as political story-telling game?Unfortunately those aspects are not presented in a way that makes me want to find out more. The political maneuvering I found very straightforward and while this might get more difficult later on, nothing I've seen in any of the previews suggests that the way to handle the different parties changes significantly. I think the system might work quite well in a role playing playthrough where you stick with one ideology and try to press it through regardless of what the council thinks though.Which brings me to the storytelling aspect. Unfortunately none of the political parties feel alive enough to make for good stories and your personal story as the mayor character is restricted to a few largely inconsequential eventsThe graphics are well done and follow a coherent style. However, the rest of the presentation definitely feels subpar. Let's just say multiple missing or wrong tooltips and spelling errors just in the first hour of the game doesn't leave a good first impression.So in summary a great and novel idea that sadly falls flat in the execution and does nothing to make me want to play more. I guess there might be some potential in here as a political role playing simulator, but I just find the core game play not very engaging.			"

												I was really hyped about this game when I first saw it, but it turned out to be disappointing and overall I don't think it's worth 40+ euros. My recommendation - play Tropico instead, it has better music too.1. The tutorial doesn't quite help in instructing what to do. I was asked to create a new district, but the proposal didn't go through, so I had to wait some time to create the said district. All peachy, but now what? I've played for 20 more years, but no other pop-up to tell me what else to do. And of course there was no goal mentioned anywhere, however, I couldn't fully utilise all the features, because the institutions were locked (even though I've researched both the port and train station). So I had to start over the campaign.2. The map is not fully displayed, not even as a minimap, nor can you move around by moving the cursor to the edge of it, so creating a new district or placing a service turns out to be quite hard to do, since you have to right click+drag to have visibility. 3. Things get repetitive after a while - All you do is plead the council to approve your proposals and select choices on random events.4. Technology vs city approvals - Ok, you have the electricity, water and gas unlocked, but your council is constantly REFUSING to adopt these technologies in the districts. No matter how much you plead, demand or threaten. So what's the point of having them, if you can't use them?5. No clear explanation on how the economy works. You are just told in the tutorial that you can see the city data. But that's all. So you end up with bankrupt companies without explanation and the point mentioned above doesn't help either, since the companies can't expand/function due to the lack of resources. I wish they had released an early access game, at least to have the satisfaction of knowing they'll improve it. Think twice before you buy it.			"

												The concept of this game is great - the execution is lacking.I wanted a game that focussed on the politics of running a city - playing factions against each other, ensuring that you had a plurality of support even if upset some groups. This is not that game. The march of progress is predetermined, and your actions have a negligible impact on it. More to the point, your prior actions count for nothing - council elections ignore your impact on the city, and there is not even the prospect of asking for a quid-pro-quo from an ally to get something you want - if their initial inclination is to oppose a proposal your only option is to beg, taunt or threaten them into submission, at the expense of your previous months of friendship.The game has many, many numbers...but no feedback. If your city is making a loss, there is no indication why, and the city-builder-lite approach means that you have no practical way of solving the deficit anyway, short of exploiting a glitch in the game's logic.I suspect a very large percentage of players are like me - they played once, got the ""End of the Line"" achievement, and have no desire to play again. Which is a shame - this promised to be the game this niche was waiting for, but failed to deliver.			"

												Needs a coat of polish and a price drop, but this scratches an itch for a niche that hasn't ever been filled.  I'm a student in Land Use and Government Law (among others) and I've been waiting for a game that makes you less of a ""God Mayor"" simulator where you design a city without limitation, but more of a ""county supervisor"" simulator, where even small actions are political and costly beyond just the bottom line of the city.  This is that game... it just needs a bit more work.  Kalypso has a history of releasing games that have great core ideas but need a bit more work, and this is another example of the same.  The game needs a few more rounds of optimization, as it shouldn't be causing my computer so many problems.  The UI needs work and just EVERYTHING needs Paradox style tooltips to explain what it does and how it plays into the city as a whole.  Finally, the political simulator needs a bit more difficulty thrown in (or the economy does).  But still, if this is a game that will receive a lot of post-release support, than it could easily become a long-time favorite.  $40 is a bit steep for the state it is in now, though.			"

												So... I read the reviews and thought 'nah it can't be that bad'.It is. Believe the reviews. The choices you make seem to have very little impact and the causality of 90% of the statistics peppered throughout are not remotely explained. There's no mapping as to what actions favour which parties or inclination of any real difference to your character's influence around it.I ultimately gave up on my second attempted playthrough because it seemed nigh impossible to actually fathom out how to progress or improve anything in any meaningful name.

												Unbelievable. Over 1 month after release and no patch for all of the errors highlighted in these reviews.I love Tropico, but this is outrageous. I would not recommend this game for over $5 as it currently stands. It needs serious fixing. Luckily, the majority of the fixing is easy - but for some reason there hasn't been a word out of the dev team for this or any hotfixes.			"

												Oh dear. I pre-ordered this game the moment I heard of it. What a great concept! Whenever I played SimCity or Cities: Skylines I always thought - 'something's missing'. Mayors are not dictators; they're constrained by constantly changing political circumstances and harassed by often viscious opposition parties. So a city game with the political element sounded ideal. Unfortunately I don't think I've ever been more disappointed by a game.The developer clearly had a great idea but then struggled to realise it. The result is a flat, one-dimensional game that offers no depth either as a city builder or as a political simulator. The city building bit is ridiculously simplistic - drag and drop your district and, boom, you're done. The political simulation is equally simplistic. You want something? Ask the City Council for it and then 'influence' the parties - i.e. perform the same repetitive clicks over and over again - until they let you have it. It's too easy.The different parties have no depth to them. I don't get the impression of dealing with a complex, roiling mass of confliciting political ambition like an actual city council would be. You don't even get to know the names of the party leaders - which is odd as the game is supposedly character-driven. They're just sort of... there. The bias towards socialist policies is also obvious and irritating.Game mechanics are frustrating, too. The only thing you can really do to actually build your city, apart from place districts, is place services. These are crazy expensive so you can't place many and rather than their effectiveness being tied to how many people can reach them on the street - like most services in Cities: Skylines for example - there's a ridiculous radial influence that just leads you to bunch everything in the centre where it will reach more people.Graphics, too, are poor. There isn't a feeling of a living, breathing city but of a dull, slow collection of pixels.I could go on but in short - save your money (also - £35!!! Jog on). My only hope is that now this idea is out there, some other developer will turn it into a worthy game.			"

												This review will be updated as more information is gathered. [Updates at bottom]TL, DR: In a game espousing political wrangling, manipulation, and development there is only one political path available and it will happen whether you pursue it or not; the other parties will eventually pass every edict that is beneficial/required (unions, child labour laws, etc.) without any need for input. There are no significant historical decisions to make, as history is single-tracked (so no alt-history fun), your decisions are irrelevant and coercing the political parties is pointless anyways because there is only one outcome no matter who you play as. Tropico had more political influence and shaping than Urban Empire does.The Tropico from the 1990s. =====Normal Review Follows=====The citybuilding element of this game is simplistic (not bad) and a little awkward at times (having to modify/improve infrastructure on each small district individually): it's serviceable, given that the game is focused on the political landscape.Unfortunately this is where the game (from what I've seen so far) falls flat. Playing a technocratic mayor I found that the only social progress I would ever meaningfully make was towards the ideals of the modern left; nearly all of the conservative ones seemed to have drawbacks whereas liberal ones were purely beneficial. Why would this bother me, given that I am (for want of a better term) liberal? Because there was no teeth to the opposition. There was no temptation. The populace inevitably voted left-wing and thus all edicts were effortlessly passed to support their policies, while the conservative groups languished, ineffective, in the background. Was it because I educated my populace that they so overwhelmingly supported such efforts? It's impossible to tell, since education is required just to keep the population content.To compound matters a selling point of the game is marching onward through the eras with the political tribulations that followed. Unfortunately these matters seem to have almost no impact on anything you do in-game. A recession hit and I lost some income but recovered regardless. The Emperor was deposed and fled to my nation but no apparent benefits, drawbacks, or gameplay mechanics followed. Russia gets invaded by bloody France and there is no evident impact on my city. There's no alt-history, as has been confirmed by others, and there doesn't seem to be any way to influence politics or even be influenced _by_ politics, at least from what I have currently seen.Next playthrough we'll see if a nationalistic luddite will actually change the way the game goes, or if it's all just kicking and screaming into the mundane future without regard for the possibilities that would emerge from quirky alt-history antics.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------So far, so bad. Only way to progress is through unions, rights, etc. Spent the entire first two parts of the campaign resisting Unions (despite them having no mechanical downside and, I believe, being absolutely necessary to upgrade your economy/income), but ultimately it's futile. While you can use underhanded means to usurp other political parties there doesn't seem to be any reason to do so. Over time they'll want to pass various laws that will only improve your society/income/etc. As previously stated, these edicts are almost exclusively left-leaning and there are no means to, say, create a human rights abusing society like China. In a game where the entire draw is the political wrangling and manipulation, why is there only one political route to pursue that offers any success and is met with minimal resistance regardless of which parties you court? Hell, the conservative (or just abusive) policies I try to set offer me little but political gain with the party I already associate with, while the liberal/human rights ones give political capital, popularity, and economic advantages.I feel like I'm railroaded into playing the game only one way. Despite having four ""Dynasties"" a tthe start (which, too, are preset) and the tagline being the option to influence decisions such as womens' rights and child labour, there is literally no reason to oppose any of it. Whether you pick the human rights advocate or the tech-hating luddite conservative it all ends the same way and trying to change it does nothing but prolong the inevitable.Urban Empire espouses choices that matter but so far... none of my choices matter.

												First,  let's make it clear, this is NOT a city builder like Cities Skylines. It is closer to Democracy 3. The concept of this game is a great one in my opinion, though the execution is somewhat questionable:1. Grab that Cash and Make a Stash. The biggest issue is value for money, $43CAD is a bit steep for the amount of content you get, compared to the likes of lets say Facturio, which is $25CAD. 2. Same Day Different Ruler. I'w done playthroughs with all the different families and all of their events are scripted and always the same, there is no variation to the outcomes of the same options when you decide on an event. Furthermore the different families play pretty much the same in general with little variations.3. Click and Wait, Click and Wait! The Council is more of an annoyance than a great game mechanic at this point. It lacks any depth whatsoever. There is little consequence in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off your rivals. If “good will” goes negative the only thing is that your pleas/demands/threats have less of an effect. As opposed to, when threatened, causing massive opposition from them, this seems to not happen. Furthermore there is no interaction with the parties on the council other than the voting.4. Information Boogaloo...Though the game has a myriad of info screens, it somewhat lacks the ability to give you necessary information. You have no way of knowing why businesses are doing poorly or why there are problems in certain areas. The game has lots of visual cues that tell you something is wrong or happening, but nothing to indicate why or what. This is a problem since now you have very little info to figure out how to solve it.5. Flash Ahaaa, Fastest in the Universe. The pacing seems to be a bit off, you can breeze through the 5 eras in 2-3h or so. This makes the game more of a race to the finish rather than a sit down and rule your city type of deal, if I were to compare it to Crusader Kings II.     6. Rule and Drool. Since all the events seem to be scripted and there is no randomness or variety in the outcomes of your decisions, the ruling aspect of the game gets old quite quick. Which is a big problem since the ruling mechanic is the main focus of the game. To add insult to injury there is very little to do: plop down a district, raise/lower taxes and pass a few edicts...that's pretty much it. There is very little political intrigue. You can spy on parties, but the result is the same, you get dirt and use it to get the party to vote in your favor...again not a lot of depth.7. Mayor the Useless. Your character is a bit useless, though you get some bonuses here and there... there is again no depth or necessity for it, unlike Crusader Kings, where your ruler has a major impact on your country's well being.In conclusion the idea is great, but this game lacks any sort of depth whatsoever. Couple it with the $43CAD price tag and value for money isn't there! It's sad, as these types of games are my forte, was hoping for a more complex city RULER rather than a mobile esque clicker. The game has a lot of potential, it just needs to be taped. Maybe with steamworks support and a lot of DLC this could evolve into something great. We shall see what becomes of it. If you want a city builder - this is not it.If you want a city ruler - this is not it...Yet.If you want a simple niche game...if the price doesn't concern you - give it a shot.			"

												Played 8 Hours... I can most definately say this game is not finished. Many minor bugs and simple things left out of the game like undo buttons or easier ways to lay out districts.. Dont get me wrong it works but its not perfect. The game overall though I can already say is boring and repetative ... Yes you can change families and start new games make new laws and do things differently, ultimately your doing the same thing over and over on the same land and cant truly expand a big city as the land is extremely restricted. Same size as the starting block on Cities Skylines without buying other land to expand.. So its small ... Hopefully they will be active in making changes to the game so I can change this review... Was expecting more!			"

												I have played quite a bit and I can say that this game is in no way worth the price. The concept is interesting, but there is a complete lack of documentation, as to why anything hapens the way it does, why decisions are made by the council and how you can fix it. There have been a few ""guides"" that tell you to tax everyone to the max and roll in money; and then the third age rolls around, elections come and it's ""Game Over.""  In my most recent attempt, I was making a small profit, had decent stats among the council and the population, reasonable tax levels, good city services and suddenly I lost the election.  Unless this game is patched heavily, mechanics fixed and far more documentation provided, please do not waste your money.			"

												*Yawn*  There is no replayability in this game.  Actions have only a positive or negative impact.  No complex decision making is required.  Max out LGBT Rights...no backlash from the church.  Max out workers rights...no backlash from upper class.  There is no balancing act.  Happieness of the population is so easy, and never stands in the way of progress.  The entire goal of this game is to create a super tolerant socialist state as soon as possible.  The game takes you down the same predictable path. No real forks in the roads that you can take your nation to an industrial powerhouse or a hippy commune.No events that will shake up the landscape enough to reverse the path.  I've played 24 hours, and have no desire to play again.			"

												I really like the idea of Urban Empire. Trying to balance power in a parliament while building up your (city) empire is a great premise.And the game starts of well enough. The graphic is nice and appropriate. The basic economy seems logical and interactions with the parties are clear to handle. Scripted events give additional flavor and decision.You can plan out your city, grow and advance.Later eras increase the complexity step by step.But with more time with the game I cannot help but feel, that there is something fundamentally amiss.It's not easy to pinpoint. There is not the one obvious thing that is broken. It feels like the game is obfuscating its issues, maybe unintentional. It definetly lacks in clarity. It does not feel that the developer had a clear user experience in mind. The interface is clunky, not very ergonomical and in some aspects not appropriate. Why are there no map overlays for coverages by infrastructure or services? That is the standard in city builders since years.Even worse is the instruction on the game inner workings. Explanations are lacking or confusing.In the end I wonder whever my decisions have any significant impact at all. It feels meaningless.			"

												I was very excited about this game coming out since it seemed to take away my least favorite part of City-Builder gameplay: laying down every single street and water pipe and powerlines etc... In this regard the game delivered on this expectation very well. Urban Empire is aimed at the political side of managing a city and hence it allows you to be the mayor and relieves you of the burden of also being the town engineer, subcontractor, and surveyor. This is a big plus for me and I enjoy how easy it is to build new districts and have control of the contruction of the city without being bothered by many small details.However, I cannot recommend this game primarily for three reasons:Firstly, most of the edicts, proposals, and laws that are voted on by the City Council are rather one sided. With rare exception, most of the laws/edicts only have good benefits for your city and no negative consequences (sometime not even with any monetary expense either). The edicts that do have a negative consequences often are very minimal negative effects and are greatly outweighted by the positive effects. This leads to the political gameplay feeling very linear: Its like you are an omniscient mayor who knows that all of your ideas are great and they will all have good outcomes and your task is simply to get these nitwits on the city council to realize how good all these edicts and laws are for everyone and vote for them. I find that this leaves the feeling that the gameplay and strategic element is lacking. I would much rather have stronger positives and negatives for each edict. This will greatly improve this aspect of our city but it will also cause equally big problems in this other regard. I think it would also lead to the city feeling more specialized and have a uniqueness to it from one playthrough to the next.Secondly, this games lacks a good guide to the numbers behind the game and understanding why money or happiness is climbing or falling is often not clear and so making strategic decisions becomes frustrating because unseen variables appear to be affecting your city in unpredictable ways.Thirdly, you lose goodwill with politcal parties most anytime you encourage or cajole or persuade them how to vote on a particular issue. But apart from some random events, there isn't any consistent way to gain their goodwill. So when your goodwill is low, the only solution is to just talking to the parties until the goodwill rises back up to a normal level. My problem with this is that it ignores the whole deal-making and compromising side of politics. While its true political parties often become strongly divided from each and will not have much goodwill for the other party. At other times two rather different parties will come to an agreement to work together towards some mutual goal and will build up mutual goodwill to build up a stronger political bloc. If this game had some element of negotiating between parties or building up goodwill through consessions and compromise, then it would feel like an accurate political simulation.Overall, Urban Empire successfully delivers a macro-level city building experience free of all the messy and frustrating detail work that most other city builders require. Unfortunately, the onesidedness of most of the edicts and laws as well as the inablility to cooperate and build up goodwill with political parties makes the game feel scripted and most cities feel the same as the last city you built.

												Honestly, this is a reluctantly negative review. I like the idea, I like the devs and I for the most part like the game. But there are just too many little niggles.A list of negative things I noticed, in no particular order,- The camera movement is strange, it pivots on a point too far ahead of your view (for my liking anyway).- The game lags badly as you get further into the game.- The game becomes repetitive and the challenges remain the same as you play through.-  There is little replay value as events always seem to have the same outcome. So it becomes a more about memorisation than judgement.        (I was wrong about this, it's not the case.)- There is a lot of information, but presented in a way in which it's hard to keep a track of.- There is little to no contextual information or feedback when you make decisions.- The opposing political parties feel hollow, the game is about balancing numbers, but it shouldn't feel like it as you do it.- And weirdly, the game hogs computer resources for some time after its shut down.This isn't to say it's not worth considering, it's a marvellous idea. Much of it is well done, the graphics are pleasant, the game does well to make it feel like you are advancing through time, the economic system is both detailed and robust and the technology tree is particulary well designed.I do like it, but if I made the choice again whether to buy it, I'd say no thanks.-------------------------Edit: More niggles-------------------------- There isn't any way to locate a specific industry, you can see if a district has it, but either hovering over a factory type in the list needs to highlight them, or else there at least needs to be some other way to find them, rather than just clicking on every building until you find it.- In the scenarios there is little feedback to how well you are doing, for example, in the scenario where you have to build x amount of weapons to prepare for war, there is no easily accesible feedback on how many you have actually made or at what rate you are making them.- Minor events show up in the corner of the screen on a timer, it's easy to miss them if you're not looking at the bottom corner of the screen at the time.

												So much potential, so much disappointment.This is not a 'city builder' in any sense of the phrase.  It is not a 'city ruler' either.  It's a stare at a map with very minimal interaction until you have to go and vote in the city council.I wanted this game to be fun - it's a unique concept to add the politics into a city game.  It simply isn't.  It's boring and tedious.And as I'd 'played' it beyond two hours - to try to give it a chance, I can't even get my money back due to Steam's ridiculous refund policy.Save your time and money - avoid this game.

If i decide to keep it, i'll update this review.__________________________________________________________________________________Played it a bit more, and decided to keep it. It really is more of a political simulator then anything else, still not worth $40 in my oppinion, but I dont regret keeping it.			"

												It pains me a bit to give this a bad review - it's not as bad as GA: Medieval. The problem is that the game play is completely linear and everything else is really just the illusion of choice.The only way to get new things passed through the legislature is to have tax money coming in, and the only way to get more tax money coming in is to be running a deficeit. So the game is just a constant cycle of purposely building enough to run you into the red so that you can justify raising taxes. There's not a lot that you actually get to choose.The other big issue is that not enough things are explained. And I'm not even talking about not knowing what the consequences of decisions are before hand. I'm talking about the fact that a lot of the tooltips don't make sense in english and aren't intuitive at all. There's no clear explanation of how things interact with each other.The devs only created one play style. There don't seem to be any consequences to raising taxes, so tax and spend all day! And heaven for bid you have a different idea you'll just get stuck behind with♥♥♥♥♥♥piling on top of you endlessly.			"

YouTube™ Video: Urban Empire - Logic Review 

			Views: 425		

			Gameplay starts at: 7:25 Urban Empire is a City building / Political Management game from Reborn Games. Review copy supplied free of charge.		

Text:As always, watch the video for a much more detailed analysis. Urban Empire looks pretty - that much is uncontested. The various time periods, design choices and distinct detail in every nook and cranny ooze personality. From character art to research screen, everything looks fantastic. It also has pretty good PC Performance with no dips below 60 at any time and smooth gameplay on any level of zoom.Sadly, this performance is achieved in part by just having almost no simulation of life in the town. Street look empty, sounds are subdued when available and everything just moves at a snails pace that doesn't really fit with the ""month per tick"" cycle of the game. But, it's not the visuals that make this game bland... It's the gameplay. Between having very limited information (that has almost no detail or depth) and very limited control over the city building that makes it for a very hands of and very frustrating experience. Not being able to assign districts directly, and not being able to build your infrastructure beyond a ""draw a box, call it a district and yay"" is not that fun and more than that ... everything is ridiculously expensive that keeping a solid balance is nigh on impossible... oh and keeping your economy running doesn't matter anyhow, there are no consequencesAlso, the expected political gameplay boils down to a sliderbar with a score on top. The expected depth of political gameplay or intrigue really never shows up and all voting boils down to is how often you've done one of 3 random events.Also, almost anything is put to the vote, but by and large the parties don't really oppose you in any way. With neither real counter plays or divergences in ethics being apparent in their per-vote look at things. And nothing you do will have any long or even mid term impact.Overal a shallow experience that fills a few hours before you crave either City building or Political gameplay, and it provides neither in any real way.

												Right now I voting that this game gets a no vote from me.  I don't really have that many issues with the game but I would like it if there was a correct way of governing that wasn't completely leftist.  For example if I raise taxes to 100% people shouldn't have money anymore.  I know that is an extreme example but there really isn't a reason to lower taxes in this game like there would be in real life.  Or if there is it should say it.  Also for liberal ideas which grant more rights it should be possible to lose the vote rather than getting an overwhelming majority of people in the council that always forces the issue.  Stuff like this gives an illusion of choice.  You could try it differently but the game forces you into a direction.  I wonder if the personal views of the devolper caused for this to happen because it seems to be a trend in other games like this as well(anything involving politics seem like they are try to teach you the correct way to think).  Also there still are bugs.  For example when you vote for a new mayor it doesn't tell you how the people are actually going to vote after you use your goodwill.  The screen just stays the same and doesn't change.  Also as I am writing this the blackmail feature doesn't work anymore.  Tooltips.  I would be nice if the game had them for more things other than having you click on an option and hoping you make the choice you wanted to.Lastly I don't like the save system.  Right now it isn't a problem but what if in the future I would like to say start another game.  The saves don't really seem to be ordered that well.  Of course I haven't tried deleting saves yet so I don't know how different it would be.Anyway just some thoughts on the product.  I'm pretty sure it could be fixed with patches but right now stuff like this takes a lot of the fun out of it.			"

												Had high hopes, but overall this game just seems lackluster. You spend WAY too much time waiting on ""Counting Votes..."" screen. Even when the outcome is obvious, every single decision in the game has to be voted on by the council; that much is fine, but having to wait at a ""Counting Votes..."" screen for all 60+ members to vote every single time is painstakingly boring. Moreover, after 3 playthroughs, I never felt like I got a grasp on how the economy works at all. It wasn't self-evident in the slightest, and I could never get a stable cashflow, and I was clueless as to what was going wrong.On two of my playthroughs, I couldn't even make it to the end of the game. One in particular was frustrating because all the different citizen needs/desires on the ""wheel of life"" were all positive. I was making everyone happy (and had a huge treasury reserve with a positive cash flow) and suddenly the council voted me out as mayor... which immediately ends the game. These kinds of interactions where stuff doesn't go as you'd expect and there's just no way to make sense as to why things are happening that way, plague the game. There is a tutorial mode, but it doesn't do a good job at explaining the underlying economy, supply/demand, or any of that.Additionally, the political simulation seemed like it was on rails. The council would recommend something, like ""Ability for citizens to form corporations"" and the vote would fail. The next month, they'd suggest it again, and the vote would fail... this would go on for years and every time it pauses your game and you have to watch the ""Counting Votes..."" screen.As for feeling like I was my own mayor... I was really disappointing in how that worked, probably from my own lack of understanding how the game was designed. I thought that I could be a mayor, but in this game that's not the case. Rather, you play already created characters, with their own backstories and agendas. You can make small tweaks here or there, but I was saddened by the lack of customization, for lack of a better work, which kept me from feeling immersed in the sim.			"

												Pros:- Interesting and somewhat novel concept.- Events/Side Stories are pretty fun, but get repetitive real soon.Cons:- Core Idea is not well implemented as it is pretty shallow.- Politics lacks depth and any meaning whatsoever, also very linear and no real choices with no impact.- Parties do not have an opinion. (Left parties wanting to lower taxes for elites)- Data Views are pretty useless.- Tech tree is pretty meaningless, at the end of each era you can easily research all techs, no meaningful choices. (Doesnt mattter if you get a building a year early or late.)- Bugs (missing/wrong texts, graphics behaving not correctly when changing infrastructure, Gets very laggy to the end/ memory leak)			"

												In general? Loved the idea but execution is poor as only it could be. Community was enthusiastic for this game. I myself was very positive upon release and seeing Dev team interest in bugs being reported. Game required a lot of additional work but it seemed we will make it better. However sweet beginning lead to bitter end. Devs basically abandoned the game. Amount of bugs and issues (with optimalization in late faze making game unplayable as priority) that would require significant work most likely made them jump of the ship and pretend this game did not exist.Taking this into consideration and absolutely unforgivable behavior of Kalypso I suggest being very cautious when thinking about buying their game. In case of Urban Empire I feel cheated and if I didn't give the game some credit hoping for improvement I would definitely request refund from steam. Don't buy it. At current state it is unplayable and way overpriced. It is not worth more than 5-6$ with quality you get. "

												This is the first game I have ever returned on Steam.  I wanted to like it, I played several games as different families, tried several strategies to no avail.  After more than 10 hours played the glaring deficiencies could no longer be overlooked.  The economy makes little to no sense, it felt like whoever designed the economy had only a passing familiarity with how economics work.  Very frustrating.  As for the politics, there is no real feeling of agency as a player.  There is a general trend towards Liberalization(i.e. Women's /Gay Rights) which the player either goes along with, or if you try to buck the trend you get stuck voting over the same edicts time after time.  Ultimately I felt like my time played boiled down to just watching bars progress.  Waiting for a vote, which was a foregone conclusion, come up for a vote.  It felt pointless, so much so that in my final game I didn't even feel like trying to get reelected.  The last thing this game had to offer was a defeated screen.			"

But that idea ends up feeling half-baked at best.The economics of the game are also way off.  Want to install street lamps?  You greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!   Want to have an asphalt road? You wasteful pig!  What's that?  You want phone service?  What the hell is wrong with you; we cannot afford that!If the developer re-dials the economics to make upgrades more balanced (not ""easier"", just more balanced), it would help this game out a lot.

												The game attempts to combine city building and politics and fails in both aspects. Both of these features lack proper depth and lack replayability after the first game due to their repetitive nature. The city building lacks proper customisability and when the city gets too large, the game crawls to a very low FPS.The council is poorly implemented, parties will become defunct in the next era no matter how popular they are within the city. The only real interaction with the council is threatening or spying on them to pass a law.The game can be summed up in three features: Place a district, change taxes and pass a very linear set of laws every game. The game has a good concept, but a very bad execution.			"

												This game seems to have been rushed to publication. A great number of spelling and also grammatical errors in the english version certainly hints at that, as well as severe memory leaks in endgame which make the experience very laggy. I like the concept of the game and I like its challenges. However, the voting system that allows the player to stay in office - or not - seems arbitrary. All of a sudden parties who like you and who you have positive standing with will vote against you. It is a frustrating aspect that makes re-starting a scenario a burden instead of an enjoyable prospect to play the game with a new focus. I do enjoy the game and would like to recommend it at this point, but it would not be a heartfelt recommendation.			"

												This is a great idea, poorly implemented.Aside from the many bugs and general poverty of useful explanation or clarity around the mechanics, it's essentially just quite boring quite quickly and with very little promise of being replayable. There certainly are some nice ideas, and in the short term it's a better political management game than the likes of the Democracy series, but the repetition and the sheer frustration of wondering why the economy is behaving as it is kill your enthusiasm. Perhaps with some essential patches and extensions of clarity and purpose it can be redeemed, but as of now it's not worth your money.			"

												Anyone can build a city - not many can RULE a city.  Fair warning, this isn't another SimCity or Cities: Skylines - this is the political game BEHIND the running of the city, with a little smattering of city building and planning mixed in.  Where you would plan to build a police station, and how to route roads was the bread and butter of city planning games - how to get the city to run effectively through city councel politics is this games focus.  This also means that you have to learn the political game of schmoozing, pleading, walking the fine line between love and hate - and not making enemies.Pros:+ Different approach to a genre that has recently enjoyed an upswing+ Making friends and influencing people really has an impact on things, versus just making money the primary factor in something failing or succeeding.+ Different political families present something to latch onto as the player - you are playing a role, not just some invisible semi-god making decisions about things affecting everyone else.+ The different eras allow you to see how progress affects decision-making.+ Tool-tips on many concepts allow you to grasp the games concepts without digging out a PDF manual (or printing them off, if you are 'pen and paper' kind of ruler...)Cons:- Some of the random events seem to not be well described - so choices seem arbitrary.- Difficulty lacks granular controls to allow you to ease into this new hybrid genre of a game, you either catch on and succeed or you don't - and you end up restarting when it all goes to ****.I think the game would be worthy of a good 70-78% approval rating.  Good roots, but needs some smoothing over in spots to really make it a knock-out.  Definitely worthy of the pre-order cost, a good choice with a small 'wait-and-see' recommendation at full retail price.  Kalypso always seems to iron out the wrinkles in their games, and they will likely do so with this one as well.  Just remember - ruling the city requires politics, politics is playing nice with others, if you don't play nice with others - this game is going to be really hard for you.			"

												Sadly, I cannot reccommend this game. There's many reasons but I'll keep it brief. The way this game sells itself as a political/city builder hybrid is true to an extent, except that each aspect is way too shallow. First the city building, or lack thereof. You only really build service buildings - schools, police stations, clinics, etc. - and you are stuck building your city using a district mechanic, which involves just clicking and dragging over an area. The roads and zones are automatically done for you. There's much more to say but if you're looking for a city builder - don't look here. Secondly, and most disappointingly (as I knew the city-builder aspect was second fiddle to this part) the political simulator is just not good, at all. The parties are hard-wired to rise and fall depending on the eras, so no matter what decisions you make - there will be the same parties. The political decisions themselves wreak of a liberal, socialist bias. The game sort of forces you to adopt progressive policies because the benefits are simply all positive and there's no counterbalance to give you pause for not adopting it. There's literally no reason to play with a conservative minded playstyle, you will be far behind somebody who just adopts all the progressive policies as they become available. I had high hopes for this game, but I have to say it's one of the most disappointing purchases I've ever made.			"

												What I like:(1) Interface - one of the easier ones to learn. (2) Tutorial - it could be more clear, but for the most part, it's straightforward if you're paying attention. (3) The general idea - as a long-time fan of the Tropico franchise, it was nice to see Kalypso trying something similar, yet new. (4) Politics - having to work the game's political system to stay in power and pass legislation requires cunning and strategy, making it easily the best part of the game next to building stuff.What I don't like: (1) Game crashes - that speaks for itself, except to say they're mercifully infrequent. (2) Financial aspect - it seems the only way to increase revenue is to up the tax rate, putting your city at a 70% or higher rate by the end of the game. Income seems unaffected by population, and when switching a district to medium or high density, the revenue almost never outweighs the costs, regardless of the demand for new space, which is almost a new problem itself with how the zoning demand meters never seem consistent or accurate. (3) Slow - due to the issue with how finances run, progressing and upgrading the city go very slowly. I've completed several campaigns with different families, but I never once had the revenue to risk paying for high density. If there's a way to do it consistently without following a strict strategy, someone please tell me and I'll try it out and edit this review accordingly. Otherwise, there's something seriously wrong with the financial aspect of this game. Comparitively, (4) the political consequences always seem a bit too easy, and fixing it would not be a simple matter of making things harder. There should be more options to really make it the complex challenge the game suggests it is (more details within the available options also wouldn't hurt).Bottom line: If the developers fixed zoning demand, political consequences and options, revenue/cost issues, and the crashes, it would be a much more playable/replayable game. Until then, I've played about as much as I'm interested in playing it, and at 15 hours of play, I can't say it's worth buying.			"

												As someone who is obsessed with government simulation and strategy games, I saw this game and immediately pre-ordered it. I watched numerous videos of gameplay and it appeared to be just my cup of tea. Upon release, and several hours of playtime, I feel as though I've had my fill, not $34 worth, but a fill. The initial era is perhaps the most enjoyable portion of the game, it feels busy, turbulent, just as you begin your city—in other words, it feels as though you are truly engaged in creating a city, executing its policy, improving infrastructure, et cetera—however after the inital issues are settled, it slows down significantly. Oftentimes you find yourself barely making enough money to pay for simple improvements like gravel to cobblestone roads, and virtually never are able to increase taxes unless the deficit is immense, and even then it can be a struggle. By about era IV, you end up focusing less on improving and expanding your city through public works projects and legislation, and far more on simply hoarding goodwill so that you can sway the parties each time a mayoral election comes around (perhaps it's user error, or perhaps simply a reflection of the reality of politics?). Though at first I noticed a trend towards more left-wing parties and policies having a sort of inevitable quality to them (which, mind you, I do not mind being a very liberal/left-wing person myself), the reality of it is that no matter how much you support these parties (such as supporting their legislation or merely being cordial to them), they almost always end up stabbing you in the back by the time elections come around—I've found myself having no other choice than to threaten the parties in order to remain in office by the later eras.On the more technical aspects, the game itself is good-looking (though draw distance is far shorter than it should) and the graphics, though perhaps not revolutionary, are fitting, and the visuals do not leave me disappointed in the slightest. The game runs very smoothly on my PC (despite it not being necessarily a ultra-powerful machine) on the highest settings. Overall, I have encountered no game-breaking bugs or issues that have ruined the gameplay simply because of developer error. On that same note, responding to pop-up events is in many ways taking a shot in the dark, as the impacts of the decisions aren't known until after it has been made (though truthfully after some playtime one can guess to a point the impacts they will have), and if I would request a specific addition to be made to the game, it would be to add the statistics to the decision screen so that more informed decisions can be made. Additionally, I would like to see difficulty settings and/or different gamemodes that cater to players' different playstyles or fortés, or merely adjustable/toggleable settings for campaigns that can add diversity to each playthrough, something that I believe would be a welcome addition, especially taking into account how repetitive and grinding the game can become as early as 1-2 hours into a campaign. Being as this focus more specifically on political aspects of governing a city, I might also recommend a system be put in place that would allow a player to create their own party, that way they could fight to pass their own policies and work to elect their own councilmembers rather than be limited to merely courting the leadership and membership of other parties which may or may not help fulfill the mayor's agenda. Though the political aspects of this game are a refreshing change for a ""city builder/ruler,"" they could use more fleshing out, as it feels very disconnected and two-dimensional in its current state.Long story short, Urban Empire is an interesting and rather ingenuitive approach to the age-old city builder genre, however it is executed in a way that feels shallow and repetitive to experienced and newcomers to the genre alike. I will likely play this game more, nevertheless, and look forward to future updates and DLC, though I hope that the developers will heed the input of the community and release a significant amount of free content to improve upon a regrettably barebones game. As previously stated, I am someone who plays strategy/simulation games all the time, I love the idea, and the game is far from bad as some other reviews have stated, but it needs more draw and replay value to keep even the most battle-hardened strategy gamers coming back for another playthrough, and quite honestly I am on the cusp of recommending to that demographic in particular, but widespread appeal to people not as weird as me is, unfortunately, lacking.Final conclusion: amazing concept, needs more work.6/10			"

												I was really looking forward to this game. The concept has potential. Unfortunatly, the execution is disapointing. There isn't much to do: you designate a district within which the little people can build; you adjust taxes; you issue edicts and then (the main point of the game) you go to the senate chamber and vote on your choices. Before the vote takes place, you have the opportunity to influence the parties. This is it. The whole purpose of the game... and it's so simplistic. It should have been marketed as a casual game, because there is very little depth. I managed to go long stretches without having to convince the parties... which means the game kind of plays itself for long stretches.			"

												A good try but falls well short of the mark especially at the price for sale instore.  It's kind of a mix of Democracy and Sim Societies with the problems indemic in those two games multiplied together.  The demand ratio system is buggy, infrastructure options double up rather than upgrading.  Costings are near impossible to afford in the time periods and if you want to keep playing past Era V eventually the environment rating drops into the negatives no matter what.  I paid $60 AUD for this as I bought it from a store, definitely about $40 too much, especially since when I installed it off the disc I had to essentially uninstall it and download it from Steam to get it to work.  If I'd bought it on Steam I'd have asked for a refund.  I should've put the money towards something else.  Next game from this publisher I think of buying I'll definitely test try first.			"

												Hey guys, I have played this game for quite some hours now and these are my thoughts about the game.At first the game is really promising. The concept is great and I was really looking forward to it.First problems first, the game is badly optimized I cannot get through the second part of the game (lag). I have read the forums and this seems to be happening a lot to people. So if you do not have a good pc do not buy the game at this moment.Then in my first playthroughs I was really struggling getting the hang of the game mechanics. It was a decently challenging game and I liked it. But after like 10-15 hours I knew exactly how to play the game. So for me now this game is way to easy, after only 15 hours of playtime I know exactly what to do.Then it also seems that there is only one way to rule, if you want to succeed. (liberal - progressive thinking)Furthermore convincing the council seems to be a big part of the game, however if you build your districts correctly and research in a smart way they will allways vote yes. It comes down to wether you have a positive tax rate.'With my playstyle, I got up to 750k + tax rate per month, 40000 citizens, WOL happiness 9-10 and I almost finished all era 3 inventions being at the end of era 2. At this moment I cannot continue due to the lag.At the current stage of the game it was not worth the 40 euros.To improve the game they should focus on:- optimalization- adding a layer of depth- more pathways to succes- in depth politics (more agenda of the parties, instead of just needing good taxes)- more trade offs for being progressive - liberal- more benefits for not moving forwardThis would greatly improve the game.At the moment I am almost done playing this game, and 35-40 hours of gameplay for 40 euros just does not cut it.I hope this review gives some help in making a decision.

												Fun game ideas, decent execution on some of them, not-so-good on a lot of them. And then there is the performance problem, or the complete lack of performance. If the performance wasn't so god-awful it could be a fun game, if a bit silly and random in its political simulation... But if I can't actually play the game, well, not much fun to be had.Let's take it step-by-step:1. Politics.Fun idea. Fun when it works properly, but often it doesn't. The political compass doesn't translate into sensible parties (sensible as in resembling reality to some degree), and there is no way to tell how you are being placed on that compass... you might think you are a left-leaning liberal, but when mayoral elections come along, all the right-wing centrists support you, and the progressives are the ones that vote against you. Why? No way to find out.Nevertheless, if you suspend your disbelief, and have don't expect the compass to be anything remotely realistic, it is an interesting barrier mechanic you have to work your way around... Devs should just throw out the realistic names and connotations, and just run with the underlying mechanics.2. UI and useabilityUI itself is decent, if a little action heavy (too many clicks to accomplish some things) not too hard to use, or learn. The problem is there is a big lack of feedback and general information about what is gonig on in the city, and what the consequences of your actions are. *Why is the restaurant industry making more money than the next 10 combined, while not having a sales boost or booming demand? No clue. *Why are the elite and lower classes unemployed? No clue, the industry tabs only shows middle and working class jobs per category. *Why are all these businesses bankrupt in this one district, but not in the one next to it? No clue... I can look at all of them individually, but it only tells me the current situation, not any of the causes.*Incomprehensible tooltips galore, where figuring out if the +5% figure on a red downwards-arrow accompanied icon is a good thing or not is a matter of trial-and-error. *Some decisions in events have no tooltip, but if the previous choice had one, it remains displayed, confusing the player. 3. Variety and replayability:Barely any of either. Game is fairly linear, with far too few choices. *A grand total of 3 maps are present currently, but since the maps make no difference in how the game plays, there might as well be 300. One of the maps states that the mining industry would be a defining economic force, due to mountains and such... well, that does not in any way translate into game mechanics. I tried all three maps, and had pretty much the exact same industry composition on all of them.* The 4 families are fun additions, they can make you play somewhat differently. Good idea, expand upon this.4. And the big bugbear, Performance:*Specs: i5-4670 @3.4GHz. GF970, 16GB-1866 RAM, 256GB SSD.*Scenario 1: max quality 1080p, 1914, city of 45K people, era 3 techs all unlocked.*Result 1: 2-16 FPS on 2x speed, 5-22 on 1x speed, 10-15 second freezes every 3-4 months. Unplayable on higher speeds (freezes every couple seconds).*Scenario 2: lowest quality 1080p, 1914, city of 45K people, era 3 techs all unlocked.*Result 2: 15-25 FPS on 2x speed, 20-30 on 1x speed, 5-10 second freezes every 3-4 months. Barely playable on higher speeds.Having taken a much smaller city (15K people) to 1936, while still having 30-40 FPS on 2x speed, it seems that population increases and number of districts severely limits performance in the game.This is the one that kills it for me, if I'm doing well, the game becomes unplayable very fast. Until the performance issue is solved, I can't recommend this game.This game should've been released to Early Access, and sit there for a couple months until it is fully baked, then release it.			"

												Do not buy this game. Ruling a city? Not so much. More like you get to propose an idea and then if your lucky it will be passed. Nothing fun about this game. Also don't know if it is my computer or what but it runs very slowly and takes a long time to load. Not worth $40, heck not even worth $20. Should be in a bargin bin for $5 or less.			"

												Guiding a city through 200 years of development while you wheel and deal to stay in power sounds fantastic. Unfortunately this just doesn't live up to the concept. You spend most of your time waiting for technology to develop, pushing through edicts that don't seem to ever have any real downsides and occassionally updating your districts with new infrustructure that will most likely send you into bankrupcy.The scale and scenario just don't seem right, it's more town neighbourhood management rather than city management, a bigger city with less control would have actually been more interesting and would then make more sense as to why every area needed to be plugged into the grid seperately. There's alot of stats showing which districts are voting  which way but if there's a way influence this significantly i haven't found it. Also each era wipes out these trends and replaces them without any seemily coherent logic.Lastly there's just alot of rough edges to this game, tooltips that occassionaly tell you what will happen with a choice but not always. A storyline that's meant to be about each of these ruling families in the city but which seems completely disconnected from the rest of the game (and very under-baked). Hopefully other developers take this concept and run with it because there's definitely something here, unfortunately this just doesn't feel like anything other than a good concept.			"

Just transaltions for more languages hopting to make a few quick bucks before jumping ship. Which they have done now. So officially 1 dec posted on the forums for 2 months now they ignore completely. Utter rubbish and gisgraceful. BTW this is a calypso tactic they have done the same on the last few games. Be warned about everything they release.			"

												So far, I have 21 hours in Urban Empire. I really want to like it, but it needs some fixing. Some of the points I'm bringing up have probably been brought up, and I have noticed that the developer is paying attention to the reviews, so they may already be working on fixing the issues. Anyway, I need to share the things I have reacted to.1. The FPSWhen my city was growing bigger and bigger, I noticed a drastic drop in FPS. My PC can handle many demanding games without any major issues, but for some reason it doesn't work here. I tried lowering the graphics setting as low as possible to try to fix it, but the problems remained. In my case, my city was around 70.000 inhabitants and sometimes the FPS went below 10 FPS. I'm wondering if it's at all possible to get higher than 60 FPS in-game, because it feels like an FPS lock. I wouldn't have a problem with that if it ran at 60 FPS the entire game, but it doesn't.2. Lack of clear informationFrom the get go, I was really confused with all the information that was given to me. I still have trouble finding information about different things, however that may be my fault. One thing is really bugging me whenever you resolve an event and get bonuses to some of the different aspects (social life, happiness, security etc.): sometimes you get an indication to what is affected in what way when you hover over with your mouse indicator, other times it doesn't. Also, there are times when text is missing in dialogue windows. It feels very inconsistent and should be considered for a patch.3. Repetitive eventsWhether it's about the sucurity in a district, the circus coming to town, or getting criticism from a local journalist, many events show up one too many times during your ruling. So many times, in fact, that you could learn what option to choose to get the best result every time. If they would be reused after the end of time victory I wouldn't mind, but as of now it's a little too repetetive.4. Consequences?My first game I learned about the concequenses of having low goodwill towards many of the parties. But as soon as I just focused on districts and kept an eye on the taxes, I could cruise through the game without having to worry about anything political. Well, apart from the majoral election. I was so nervous the first couple of times, but as time went on I barely had to appeal to any parties to make it through to the next period. Maybe a higher difficulty setting option could be in its place.Then there are features I would like to be included, such as:- Being able to control where the RCI zones are placed in a district- Going backwards in modifying a district without having to cancel the entire modification to fix something you want to change (it's really bugging me)- Being able to zoom out even more than is possible at the moment, I want to see my entire city in all it's glory (granted if I can run it with the highest graphics setting)To be clear, I really want to like it. I'm really close to liking it. I have played some city simulators before, and even though they are fun I really want this concept city ruling to be great. After patching I think this game has great potential. I really like that the developer are keeping an eye on the feedback and wish them the best of luck in making this game the best it can possibly be.As of now, I can't fully recommend Urban Empire. I want to, but I can't. I sort of like it, I want to really like it. It's not a terrible game, but it's not a great game yet.EDIT: Ignore what I said about going backwards in modifying a district. Turns out that I was blind and missed that feature.			"

												If you are looking to get this game hoping for a fun city-builder with intricate politics, you're mistaken. This is not what you're looking for at all. It is a ""mayor simulator"" but even then, it is not a fun one.You essentially play as the mayor of an Austrian town. You get to choose between four families. After you choose your family and your starting era (you are locked to 1820 starting date from first playthrough) you then choose the map... there are THREE MAPS. THREE. That's it! There's next to no variation! Extremely dissapointing from a $44CDN title. Moving on.You get into the game, and within an hour I noticed the absolute lack of content. The hyped up tech tree was very shallow, with maybe 15 techs at the final era. Services are very shallow, essentially you just plop them down and make people happy in a certain radius. City expansion/district placing is very shallow too. You draw a district (it has to be pretty square, too) then decide what percentage is industrial, commercial, or residential. Then, it goes to a vote which comes down to: if you have plenty of money, council votes unanimous yes. If you don't have that much, unanimous no. Then plop, the district is there if the vote passes, and within a minute it just fills up like that. Very underwhelming.Which brings me to the voting system, the voting is very poorly done. The best way I can describe the political system in this game is if you took edicts and taxes from Cities: Skylines, made them a slight bit more mature, and throwing a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voting system in the way, which you have to jump around. Essentially, there are a bunch of council members, a few parties, and you gotta get them to vote your side by threatening (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side), demanding (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side), or pleading (which costs political favours and ALWAYS succeeds in moving them to your side). Then the vote passes, or it doesn't and you simply try again. It's a boring system and it's a shame for a game which is nearly entirely built around this bland system.TL;DR: Don't buy this game. It is shallow, and does a very poor job with the voting system which it markets so heavily. If you want a decent city-builder, buy Cities: Skylines instead, as this game is not a good city builder nor a good political simulator. It's the worst of both worlds.			"

												I thought a city ruler style game was what I wanted over a city builder, but I guess I was wrong as this game was not what I wanted. Trust me most people playing this now will get 10 hours MAX out of this game then quit.By city ""ruler"" you can raise taxes to the max or not at all and win either way, events are all the same a predictable, the economic system is broken as I can lower bussiness taxes to 0% and no one shows up, but once we give the whole damn city a 50% tax rate with no benefits(editics) everyone is all for investment. There is also little to no content which is why the game itself lacks replayability as EVERY MAP AND FAMILIY PLAYS ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME, LITERALY NOTHING CHANGES. In addition there is the horrible tech tree (it looks cool, but the system sucks) and there is little to nothing about world events besides the newspaper articles.Now I know what your thinking, these guys made the Tropico series... yeah, but nosame publisher diffrent devs which is why this is""not"" a city builderThis game ""is"" a city builder game... with the builder taken out... Its literaly just a city that no matter what you do and who you offend on the council, you get everything your way no matter what. I can threaten a party every single month before a vote, telling them I will execute them all, and they will happily grant whatever I want. (note this is the 4th era too...)All together there was nothing that made me enjoy the game besides the inital start up on when everything was new, after a hour you realize the game is overpriced and nothing special.

												Fun the first couple of hours but then becomes very repetitive. After a while all you do is select from the same dialogs when dealing with the political parties over and over again. There is a very limited city builder included, but all you can do is select the size of the district, its composition and municipal services. So why bother at all with this builder when you basically cant use it for anything?  It may have been a great idea for a game, but the final result is disappointing. Also it is far too expensive. Right now it costs 75% of CIV 6, but the content in this game is very little compared to CIV 6. Unfortunately I can not recommend this game.			"

												I really really like the idea of this game and I was very excited to play it. Its supposed to be a strategy/management game where you need to take politics into account. After roughly 10 hours and two restarts I finally made it through the campaign. The early game was fun, but it was becoming repetitive in mid and late game. The challenge is completely gone as soon as you figure out that it always pays of if you increase the taxes as long as you keep services up. So the cycle was increase taxes, add services, increase taxes, add services until you had huge amounts of money. The parties almost never mattered, so I stopped paying attention to them. Then in the end of the fourth era I already had everything researched and was focusing on achieving the other goals in game. Some of the goals are hard to achieve, but not because they are difficult, but instead because the mechanics of the game feel random. I did not try the scenarios yet, but I will likely not do that unless they release a serious balancing patch. I did not experience any breaking bugs, however the performance of the game got worse drastically in the late game, if you play on speed four on default settings. My rig is beyond the recommended specs with an I7 and a Geforce 980ti.			"

												Family dynasty founds glorious city and leads it into a golden age.. City's Citizens enjoy universal free education and health care.. City's citizens watch WW 1 happen from their air conditioned apartments on their satellite TV while eating microwave dinners.. City enjoys more money in the bank then the whole of the Austrian Empire.. Family dynasty is voted out because they would not ban contraception... 6/10 - Would repress the christian party again.--It's on the verge of being a decent game, however most of the mechanic are shallow in regards to actual game play, it basically plays itself requiring little thought and repetitive actions. Little depth to the political game, with very few ways to influence the political parties. There are a lot of great concepts in the game, however none of them are flushed out or have any real impact.-Reconmend waiting to it buy on sale.			"

												When I first read about this upcoming game many months ago, I thought this was going to be a dream of mine come true, a hybrid between Cities in Motion, Tropico, Cities Skylines, and Civilization, a city and development planner with a strong historical perspective. Unfortunately, I experienced a sobering jolt to reality when the game was finally released. Mouse control is a nightmare, laggy and jerky, and with the keyboard (the usual fall-back for cases like this, cf. CiM2) it's not much better, too few zoom levels, too many new windows open up where you have to click okay every time, the gameplay is repetitive, there is no alluring atmosphere, no special mood that makes you feel something ... I really wanted to like this game, and the games I listed above may have set very high standards. But even though I don't think I am very demanding, I regret to have to say that this game has been a huge disappointment to me. I am not certain whether future updates may be able to improve the situation greatly, but I will not give up hope, especially with the developers coming across as being really competent as well as likeable in their videos.

												I've played two sessions ending in two rage quits. I seriously doubt the developers have even played their own game from start to finish, without using cheats. Which is a claim supported by their own screenshots. Notice when they show the screenpic of the tier IV research tree. The portray is of the second in line of the Russian banker dynasty. The year is 1826, they have 12 in research power. Yet they have research almost the entire tier IV tree. Which is literally impossible without cheating since every time the era changes, so does the guy/woman ruling your family, with merely 12 in research power you won't even have been able to leave the second era. Let's completely ignore the fact that they are losing money in 6 out 8 pics where you can actually see their stats. We shall move on to my personal experience.First I played as the Sant'Elias which was a ""progressive"" family with their minds on science and research. I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on the claim of being progressive, since I ended up becoming a mad scientist after losing my wife while she gave birth to my daughter, who became an estranged feminist, since apparentaly nobody likes a guy electricuting dead bodies in hope of raising the dead.Second time I played was as the Russian bankers, since the main problem with the first playthrough was a lack of funds. At the third era the city was making around 114k every month. To suddenly go to a -80k because of the era change. No matter what I did or how I would have played it differently. Around era IV you will want to table flip this ♥♥♥♥♥ into oblivion because it makes so little sense how your city can make a fortune one month to later lose that fortune in a matter of a year. Also what frustrated me was that the bankers where more progressive and science orianted then Sant'Elias. Which renders the Sant'Elias family as completely useless.I tried very hard to like this game since I see where they want to go with this. To emphasize on governmental management between different parties rather then city building. People telling you that this is not a city builder game is talking out of their asses. You begin with a nice open space, and your actions will lead to a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ city being built. With definition on ♥♥♥♥♥♥! You build the city based on districts and can place ""special buildings and infrastructure"" These buildings are special indeed, since they suck up all city funds and leave you with little to no prosperity..No matter what your political tactics are, whenever the era changes from III to IV you'll end up with nothing more then pulling your hair off your head because: ""New times brings new demands."" And those demands are everything against what you, the empire and ultimately the city represents, and it will punish you so severe that you won't leave your bedroom for a week.The research tree is nicely visualized but the benefits are to small. It's only function is to mock you...Infrastructure hardly brings any benefits, with hardly, I mean none.. Just loads of extra costs.The growth of the city is your responsibility. The other parties are mainly there to ♥♥♥♥ with every decision you make. (which simulates IRL quite well actually) They won't help you at all with any costs that is demanded from the city. They don't build anything of ""value"" like schools or other instituations that will be demanded in the future. Personally, you will be forced to do so.Early game is quite fun, late game will test your faith in mankind, because the whiny peasants will want more rights. Work less and everything should be free is basically what they are demanding. Leaving the city without funds to do ♥♥♥♥ all.. Even though they where voting for 8h work shifts, their children was still forced to work 10h in factories... That should give you a nice picture of what the psychology is behind these peasant scums..Forget water pipes, sewer pipes, electricity... Forget road infrastructure, never research human rights research because it will ♥♥♥♥ you and the city over big times. Besides, those rights will trickle in no matter what you do anyway. Just research industry related stuff and the ability to spy on other parties. Use that to blackmail the other parties asses so you can remain in office until the nightmare is over. GG.I give this game an extra point because I became Frankenstein. I will however remove that point because there where no monster in the end to snuggle hug.If this game does anything, it shows how impossibly ♥♥♥♥ed mankind is because of liberal decisions. Also, pro tip: Don't ban porn. You'll need some material to frustrate mastrubate to after you've played this game. >:(			"

												After some discussions in the community forums, I've copied my review/comment - I might change this once a few bugs are fixed.Just as a mid-game review and some context: I got the game for free as a gift. I casually mentioned seeing this game from a sponsored youtube pre-release let's play copy to a friend, and they bought it for me. I feel bad, because I wouldn't have paid for this myself. Currently would not recommend and here are my reasons- encountered at least one graphical bug, I have a GTX1080 on a new rig, running everything Ultra at 4K 60fps fine, but then there are these weird glitches:http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042237959/screenshot/97226806231905121- silly game breaking save bug: most people play games with a tutorial on. The first time you play this game, I guarantee you most players will not have $2m to buy the Train Station when it pops up in the tutorial. At which point, because there's an active tutorial quest, you can't save. Sure you can go into negative and beg the emperor for money, but most people playing for the first time don't want to throw their city into debt. Perhaps it was bad luck on my part, but I had the graphical glitch happen at that time too. Didn't know what to do, so wanted to save, quit and re-load. But couldn't save, so just gave up and restarted with tutorial off after reading through work-around on the forums- as other people have mentioned, the game does not explain a lot of the concepts in the game. You have to either cross your fingers or trial-and-error your decisions. This isn't that the game is hard, it just isn't streamlined and doesn't provided you enough information to be a political simulator OR a city builder. Why does that party hate you? I have no idea. I can only guess and try to enact some of the policies they want. Increasing the density of my district will increase upkeep by 100K+, what are the benefits? - beyond not having enough information, some of the wording is very strange. Perhaps it's because the dev team's first-language isn't English? For example, -5% sales demand is a good thing. This is a bit counter intuitive, as decrease in sales demand is usually bad for an economy especially when inflation is not a concept in the game. Also an example of one policy says ""mild punishment for sodomy"". In fact, this policy is to have MILDER punishment for sodomy, rather than saying let's punish sodomy mildly as the policy name implies.- when there should be information but it doesn't show. When a proposal pops up, sometimes (shoudl be all the time) you can hover over the options and it will show you what the effects will be, as an example, one policy will pop up and it'll have 3 options. You might be able to hover over none, 1, 2, and very rarely 3 of the options. This seems unintentional, and some of the effects and proposals don't line up with the flavour text. - immersion: the cost scaling is a bit ridiculous; it costs a LOT of money to install street lamps and pave roads. Upkeep is also ridiculously expensive, to the point that I'm now in Era 3, 1930s and I have districts which still have dirt paths and no lights. I can afford a train station, but I can't afford to pave the roads.BUT. If you can get past all these, the base idea behind the game is pretty fun. Balancing the political ideologies (left/right, liberal/conservative) as well as a little bit of roleplaying a family of mayors, allegiance to the Empire or independence, and balancing personal finances is quite unique. The broken parts of the game (other than the graphic bugs), can be avoided once you've played the game a few times through and know what to avoid, or in the case of not knowing what a decision will do, you can pretend it's real life and not know the outcomes of your decisions beforehand. Hopefully the game does get patched, but I whole heartedly agree, we shouldn't expect to wait for a patch before a game is recommended.			"

												Hard Locked entire system.Runs at less than 30fps on a system that can run Witcher 3 max np m8.Unengaging, unchallenging gameplay. Conservative parties serve no purpose but to give the illusion of challenge. Every edict I wanted to pass went though no issue with the occasional plead. UI is atrocious. Too many vague and undefined terms. +5% sales demand = ???. No real breakdown of interpretation of your actions into how it affects your city.Plays like a choose-your-own-adventure game. Think of all the events from CK2 or EU4, but having no clue what they do before and often even after you click an option.Praise the idea. Wouldn't have been interested otherwise, and following Quill's sponsored LP. However, with steam's 2 hour window for refunds, gotta make a call. Might revisit in the future, but just feels too amateurish for the price-tag, and too full of questionable design decisions.			"

												Pros: .Theres alot of gametime experimenting with different strategies and figuring out what works bestCons: .The most profitable industry is one with no infastructure. If you have 100% industry districts and upgrade, you'll make less money..Each change in era causes massive changes. I was doing great then it changed to era 4. commercial demand shot up, industry and residential plumeted, happiness and goodwill took a hit and there was nothing i could to to win..Tutorial only hits the tip of the iceberg of what you need to know. eg. efficiency is determined by happiness of lower and working class, and quality is determined by elites and middle class. Commercial can take care of most of you citizens demands if your taxing is right etc....Pricetag. Even if these issues were resolved, this game is only worth $30Don't get me wrong, I am not one of those people who is giving a negative review because I suck at it. I have had very successful cities. The balance and other aspects of this game just make no sense.			"

In it's current state, I wouldn't bother buying it. Wait until the dev team improve pretty much what all the reviews on this site highlight.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but it did not catch my interest after 30 minutes of play. The process of getting anything approved is tedious and the infrastructure installation in the districts is arcane at best. The tutorial and the UI are terrible. I requested a refund after an hour played.			"

												A beautiful idea which set very high expectations but did not deliver. Urban Empire is a city ruler with mediocre city building aspects and ungratifying political aspects. The game is a disappointment given that it is coming from Kalypso Media which has experience building simulation games. The game feels unfinished and overlypriced in its current form.In this review I give some comparisons to Tropico 5 as that came from Kalypso too and had some very basic elements of politics.Pros:* Despite the heavy drawbacks, there are some good elements and innovations in this game. The game introduces the concept of council politics and how to influence to get votes. * The random events in the game are funny at times and have interesting choices.* The concept of era's is well thought off and compliments the research system. The idea that the next generation of family comes on with the change in era is very good. It makes the game feel more realistic.* This list is hard to think offCons:* There is very little replay value as the game is very linear. In addition, there isn't much creativity required. Unlike traditional city builders which does bring replayibility due to the creative aspect of it, this game focuses on making decisions rather than designing. How many times will one play the same game to pass the same edicts and build the same service buildings? The map doesn't change drastically and there isn't a different way of ruling things. * In real world, central to politics is how you stay in power and campaign for your election. There is no concept of campaigning in this city ruler whose main theme is politics !? Even Tropico 5 had a basic political campaign where you had to promise changes that you would do if you win the election. In its current form, the election just seems like a repetitive boring hindrance that is placed to end your game than to provide any meaning. There is even no concept as promising other parties to vote in favor for their agendas.  * The political parties just seem to be there to vote yes/no. They have absolutely no other function in the game. As an entity you can plead/demand/threaten them to vote in your favor(whether mayor elections or changes that you propose), but vice-versa never happens. I have played 4 eras and never once did any other political party plead/demand/threaten me for a change. I would like to see more changes in politics - if as a mayor I don't promote their agendas then I would face opposition in the next election.*  There is no personality to the political parties that you deal with. They are just emotionless simulated entities that as a player you never connect with. They have their party description as to what they should be but other than that they lack everything of what a real political party is. They never propagate their agendas in media. They never interact with the player except few random events.. As a personal example - Edict to ban prostitution was not supported by Christian Democratic Party openly. Rather they were shown as Yellow in the Red/Yellow/Green spectrum of their support. How does that make sense? How can a party based on religion be indifferent towards something they claim immoral.* The game displays a lot of data in tabular format that should be graphical. In a simulator, one should be able to see trends and effects for the decisions made. * The data that is provided in game is meaningless. I should be able to see how many people are in favor gay marriages for example or want a new church in their district. Rather we get tables of detailed data that I cannot comprehend what to do with.* The simulation in game seems unrealistic too. After playing for 80 years in game and having only built 1 church in a city of 8 districs, I am seeing christian democratic party win the elections 3 times in a row. Shouldn't the lack of churches reduce the religious followers over time? Shouldn't people get less attached to religion? No data to see this, and utter confusion as to why a certain party is winning so many seats in the council. There is no demand from people prior to elections * The game is way too overpriced at 40$. The city building aspect is very basic and some mobile games have more features. The political aspects are a good start but feel rather unfinished. Past games from Kalypso like Tropico had some better political simulation aspects. The game has occasional bugs too and the UI doesn't seem complete either. No exit to desktop option? Save game freezes the entire game for couple seconds? City building area is too restrictive..			"

												I really wanted to like this game and have played 5 games but it has no depth and is way to hard.You start out, you make a good of money and think your doing great so you start adding police stations, schools and theatres etc and also electricity, gas and sewers but they don't enhance your citizens lives visibly or increase money made in any way. I have made it to age 3 on 4 occasions but everytime i start heamorrhaging money as citizens demand more services. If you provide, you lose massive amunts of money. If you don't you get voted out. Another irk is that building's don't change/grow over time. They just look the same as 1890 and 1930.The game is simly too hard, lags riduculously once you reach age 3, and feels pointless.All services are far too expensive. You install electicity as it says it helps business, the same goes for water pipes and phone lines but then businesses continue going bankrupt and you continue to lose money.Kalypso need to put some serious work into fixing this.

												The main idea of this game is quite interesting, managing a city as a mayor. You are not an absolut ruler and have to convince your council to vote in favour of most of the decision you are making, all the decrees and almost anything that is expenses related. The first playthrough is interesting enough and you get to choose a dynasty for different playstyles. But this is where the games is lacking a lot. Playing a second time, even with a different dynasty, will feel exactly like the first playthrough. There is not many different way to play the game and all of them feels the same, if you want to succeed until the end you will most definitely have the make the same choice in every play again and again.So, if you don't want replayability and are ok with playing the game once then go ahead but at least wait for a sale. If you are expecting a city simulator with more in-depth control and tweaking, then forget it. You're going to play it once and forget about it and go back to better city simulator.			"

												The game is fun up to a point. But if you make one little mistake it sets off a snowball reaction that is absolutely impossible to to recover from. Your punished for raising taxes, your punished for lowering taxes, your punished for building infrastructure, your punished for everything. Rewards are few and far between. Game is horribly balanced. Further more the random events for you to make a decision but give you no information to make an informed one. I was asked once in game to decide which person had a better idea about something, 0 data on what their idea was, what effect it would have, nothing! Add all this to no mod support and you have a game that could have been great but ended up a dud. When asked about mod support the devs said it would be too costly, yet mods could fix this game and make it great. Very disappointed.			"

												I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this game. Am a huge Civilization fan. Loved the old Sim City games. I thought it'd be a hybrid of the two. It's not. IF you are looking to buy this and see all the negative reviews are the same, ""price too high"" and all the positive ones are lacking anything helpful. Hopefully THIS helps you make up your mind. In a nutshell, all you do is wait around for something to happen. They should rename this game, ""the waiting game""As Mayor, you control very little. Have to vote on just about everything, with parties that are never adequately represented. You get to ""appeal"" to them during voting preparation, but no matter what you choose, it feels like a random game of rock, paper, scissors - with no real strategy to be had. You can't really design the city. There is very little going on IN the city. You'll hear randomly, ""paper industry is booming!"" which would be good/bad IF IT MEANT SOMETHING lol. Like say you were investing in papyrus or vellum, and PAPER started to boom. Then...oh, no, well...am screwed. But there is no real depth to anything. All service stuff that never really seems to matter. If you want to be hands on and lead something somewhere, play Civ 6 - it's great. IF you want to design a city, well...there are games out there for you. IF you want to occasionally click a button, read small print about events that you couldn't care less about as they have no context, then this here game is for you. I don't know what the developers were trying to go for with this game, but they missed the mark. Most boring experience I have had short of actually falling asleep.			"

												Damn so closeYes i know its not a city builder ,like SOOOO many have said , i know what the game is but boy this disapoints, You start as one ofa number of families all with (slightly) different traits ,WHICH DO PRETTY MUCH NOWT , and you start at 1800 , build your first district , ok so far so good ,thats fine ,shows you the council chambers and voting process , ok yep got it ,errrrr ....ummmmm....thats kind of it.Yes you can issue a few edicts , the research trees are reasonably interesting ,but again gets boring FAST.build couple more districts , change density to medium , all pass without any need to threaten parties and boom thats it .i have 39 million in the bank nd all the parties love me so i NEVER need to do anything with the voting , way overpirced for what you get (i smell massivley 10 pound dlc with  just one more family on its way).Grammar and spelling in the game is truly dreadful , hundreds of typos (quality control anyone?)music is tedious and boring after 2 minutes , now switched off for good.only 3 maps to pick from yes i agree all slightly different in terms of difficulty of building a city but as you only need 3 districts set to medium density ,that plays totally no part in anything.I really was waiting for this game , i wanted to enjoy it and for the first our i did , now i find myslef after 7 and half hours playtime just sitting there waiting for my research to finish and the next mayor election twiddling my thumbs .Sorry but this is dreadful , another overpriced and overhyped full price release .I respect the work that goes into games i really do (same issue with planetcoaster ,rollercoaster tycoon 3 i played for well over 1000 hours , planet coaster 80 and bored as hell), and i respect that they developers need to make a profit  but jeez i should of known this would not be good.The current early reviews are all pretty much negative to.Do yourself a favour wait for a sale in a years time with all the millions of overpirced dlc on its way thrown in or just avoid altogether .Igave it the benefit of the doubt but when you find yourself falling asleep to a game ,the signs are not goodedit...Now 10 hours into it and as the shuskys family it does change a little bit in era 4 i wont spoil it incase people want to play it , but not enough to dramaticly change gameplay.Reviews still coming in on online sites and are pretty poor .Mixed is fair ,Needs a bit of a re think and some FREEEE UPDATES due to the massive price for a half standard game			"

												I had really high hopes for this game, it looked like an intriguing twist on the city-builder genre. Unfortunately, the twist, i.e. the city politics, is one-dimensional and totally lacking in interaction with the other factions. Your family choice seems to have no bearing on the gameplay, other than the odd event which pops up every couple of years, and the lack of customisation is a shocking misstep (perhaps when basing a game around family dynasties, Kalypso could have looked at the success seen by Paradox with their Crusader Kings II series).Then there's the gameplay itself. It is completely impossible to run a city at a profit if you want it to grow, or if you want it to have even basic amenities, like schools and police stations. You find yourself raising taxes to ridiculous levels, which has no impact on businesses or people, or begging the Emperor for a loan. For some reason having a port or train station actually loses you money, as if those two crucial pieces of infrastructure were unable to make a profit. Wholly unrealistic.If those basic things can be changed (i.e. the entire economics of the game), and if the politics can be made interesting, rather than repetitive (i.e. the entire basis of the game), and if more options for customising characters were made (i.e. the entire plot of the game), then this would be worth some money. Currently, it is not, and should never have been released in this state.			"

												I wish I could give this a positive, because it is a good game and I do enjoy the graphics, the concept, the watching of my city as it grows, the budget juggling and politics of this story that you play......but...This is supposed to be a game, though it ends up feeling like a story that you're watching. The political parties in this game can be held back and resisted for a while, you can't control the population to influence the elections, so you're at the mercy of the games random mechanics which are poorly explained, the horrible lack of tooltips giving you -Any- information, about anything and everything, you can't even find out a why business went out of business, or why it's bankrupt, or who works where, or how to help citizens improve... and the political parties, eventually you can't do anything but accept their utter rule over you and the policies ""You"" enact for your city, even if you're highly opposed to them and have been for the entirity of the game. I respect that democracy is showcased here, but that's exactly what's wrong with this game. In the hours I've played it, I did have fun and I'll probably continue to have fun, but I don't feel like I'm a part of the game or my city or my leader, I feel like I'm merely watching them play their story. It makes me appreciate games where I find myself looking at the clock and realising a few hours have passed because it was enjoyable. Wait until it's on sale or the bugs have been fixed and the AI improved.Thank you for reading and I wish you well.			"

												david cameron simulatorKidding aside, if you're into political games (aka Democracy 3 and Nation States) that involve choosing policies and seeing how your decisions shape the place you rule (and also you look forward to the political aspects of the game rather than the city building ones), I think that you would appreciate it. The unique thing that differenciates this game from the other titles I mentioned is that one, it provides an actual visual representation of that location rather than just text descriptions and two, it features a historical storyline (with the political decisions reflecting the time period).Do not buy this game if you're looking for a city builder because that will just disappoint you since that is not the game's focus (considering the high price as well). If that's what you want, just get Cities Skylines and look for some Industrial Revolution themes/mods for your city. However, buy this game if you're looking for a good, in-depth <<political simulator>>.			"

												I have been fairly excited about this game coming out and I really wanted it to be good.  My instinct was that the current price of $40 was too high.  Unfortunately, this seems to be true. Hard to tell you exactly what's wrong, maybe the votes for even relatively minor district changes, or the lack of information and random impact of your decisions for chance events.  It's not bad and delivers some initial amusement and the concept is cool.  There is something just not quite right.  Came with only one scenerio and 3 campaign maps, but you can see that the expect to have some DLC to sale soon.   I think this is one that you should wait and pick up on sale or when you can't get all the DLC as a package.			"

												The game has two aspect.  The city council politics play and city builder.  The city council part is shallow and incomplete.  The city builder part, however, does offer a lot of depth and novel ideas.  The negative reviews calling otherwise probably does not understand the game.  It is hardly their fault though.  This game is so poorly designed on representing mechanism information to player.  The shallow tutorial barely explains the UI and interface.  And even if you bother to read the game manual, it still fail to uncover mist on some of the most important mechanisms like how social mobility works.  The catastrophic failure of presenting mechanism information to player effectively made it more of a puzzle game rather than a sim game.Rants aside, the game does have some novel design such as people's needs can be served by private sector or public sector.  And you can choose to collect a lot of tax and serve people directly, or use policy to guide the private sector to do that.  The two path apparently repesents two different modern political ideaology and was supposed to interfere with the city council politics system.  However, the mechanism behind this is more complicated than it sounds and, again, is barely explained, reaping all the potential fun off it.In conclusion it is very hard to have fun with this game even if you are a veteran of city builder game and is willing to read the manual word by word.  But do take a look at the game manual to see if you think it is worth a try.  There is a lot in this game, it is just so hard to dig them out.			"

												This game has a fun concept and I bought it on-sale because the setting was intriguing. I want very much to like this game but I can't really recommend it in it's current state. For all the data the game apparently provides, there is no intuitive way to understand why businesses are failing or what the city needs to grow. If there are any lists or charts of improvements, I can't find them. It's maddening that there is apparently no city-map view to see where you've placed service buildings or to see, at a glance, which districts have which infrastructure installed, the zoning layout, or anything you would expect.Finally, and this is what prompted my review, the game is still quite glitchy. I cannot load any of my saved games - uninstalling and re-installing did not work. Not very enthralled to have spent precious hours off from work to play a game I cannot finish. Ambitious idea that I wanted to love, but I think I'll go buy City: Skylines now.			"

												I have been playing city sims since the first Sim City. I generally enjoy Kalypso products, but this title comes up short in several areas:1. Balance: It does not truly allow alternate paths to city politics. Want to build a facist or communist state? Good luck.2. Mechanics: Too much click this, click that.3. City Customisation: No dense commercial areas. You can build a ""Manhattan"" or the like, just a mixed commercial/residential zone.4. Graphics:  Vanilla. The end game residential and commercial buildings looke exactly alike, except for a little out of place sign atop the commerical buildings. do they expect modders to do the work?5. Replayability: Do it once, it's pretty much done.All this outweighs the great concepts in the game. Maybe I'll come back and check on it in 3 months, or maybe I'll play Skylines. In any event, cannot recommend.			"

												The game is shallow when it comes to the political wheeling and dealing that is supposed to be its main premise, and the simulation side leaves much to be desired. After struggling to make an economically viable city several times - it's quite hard to get anywhere near a balanced budget - I got bored with the simulation. The interface also leaves much to be desired: the game expects a lot of attention, but the interface is too abstract to accommodate this kind of playing. Urban Empire does have a novel premise, but it fails move beyond it. Those looking for entertainment will get bored after a couple of hours, and those looking for a challenge will be frustrated by its interface and unbalanced simulation.			"

												I rarely like to post negative reviews for a title, instead liking to offer encouragement and critical appraisal for developers. However this title was a serious disappointment to me, and coming from a big publisher behind the likes of Tropico, it really needed to be better.In short Urban Empire is a political simulator, but the sad fact is it never really lives up to that in any meaningful way. All the parties I encountered, despite being placed in what seemed to be a realistic way upon the political spectrum, ended up having little to differentiate each other. With enough bargaining ( the game lets you plead, demand or threaten to change party member's stances on a vote) every party could be persuaded to accept a vote. In two hours of play I lost one vote, and that was because by that time I couldn't really care less about pushing any harder.This game has potential, but currently it feels highly random. I played for two hours and in that time I rarely felt like there were any major differences between the political parties, other than the fact that the game's scripting told them how they should vote on an issue. The social democrats always seemed to disagree, and need to be persuaded, where as the physiocratics always agreed whole heartedly. By the end of my two hours I was sadly bored stiff.You might say two hours is a short time, but I saw the second era and I put through quite a number of votes and city infrastructure changes, but by the end of those two hours I felt distinctly like I was (to quote someone else) 'pulling levers and watching how it changed things'. Between votes I would just sit and watch the city, and in the long run it all came down to budget, and a procedure of picking edicts to increase income and forcing votes to up the taxes.I just couldn't be bothered to force any more votes or try an more edicts because I simpky felt like this 'balancing act' was all I'd be doing for 4 eras. Then, much to my annoyance, I tried to save my city only to find the game wouldn't let me. It appears that unless you have finished all tutorial missions then you can't save. I'm sure that's a bug that will be fixed, but it didn't improve my first impressions of Urban Empire at the time.Urban Empire is a nice idea, but I feel it lacks too much depth to make it a game I'd recommend to people. I watched much of the game on YouTube before release, and I pre-purchased based on my thoughts. It had looked fun from watching, but playing was not the same experience.If Urban Empire only had half the humour and detail of Tropico it may have allowed me to get past the monotony of the political system (yes, I do feel it was monotonous), and indeed the only attempt at humour was a reference to Tropico (which I won't spoil). It was a nice touch, but didn't improve on things.For the first time I feel inclined to refund a title, and for that reason I can't recommend Urban Empire. There is a game here should the developers act to add in a layer atop the political bargaining. An ability to design the layout of your city would be a start, and frankly that is another thing that stopped me finding any real enjoyment in the game. If I could have done a mayor's job and planned the layout of my city, then I might have had something to do whilst waiting for votes to pass and balances to improve. But for some reason the city builds itself, or you at least have no say in road layout and rci placement. You can determine how much industry, commercial and residential is built, but not where. It's almost as if you're playing the role of a mayor with lots of helpers turned on to leave you less to do. You're just public relations for the mayor, really.			"

												TLDR; Push buttons, threaten people, wait for money. The game itself is very shallow. There really isn't much to do appart from threaten council members when they don't agree with buidling a park.  Balancing income and expenditures is near immpossible. I found myself threatning council members constantly to raise taxes, resulting in party members losing trust in me which meant I had to threaten them again to vote for me in the elections.The population sizes seems disproportionate to the scale of the city. For the whole 200 years, with around 14 districts, the population never rose above 6000.The game mechanics don't make sense. In the year 2000, all my districts still had gas powered lights, no public transport and no water grid. Citizens don't seem to care. "

												Urban Empire  is, unfortunately, not what one could expect from a city management strategy/simulation title of its price. Gameplay is incredibly shallow and repetitive, decisions and mechanics seems trivial, and the narrative is far too simple and sparse to compensate. In general, there is a painful lack of objectives or feedback from the game for any given strategy or outcome- just a quick blip of an event that adds or subtracts stats that have little to no bearing on your experience. You can run your city into the ground, or meticulously balance your budget by hand, but either way, nothing changes in terms of challenge or reward.  A sandbox without the toys, if you will.On the whole, the game feels like a very early release, minus the performance issues.			"

												In its current state, I can not recommend it. After playing a while this game looks more like a Early Access title than a finished game.Most negativ and frustrating factors:-- Massive lags in later epochs ( beginning in about epoche III ) even with my high end PC ( Skylake i7 and GTX 1080 ) and even with only medium graphic settings. Last 2 epochs are so laggy that they really make just no fun. You play them only through so you did it at least once.-- Certain calculations are buggy. For Example you can save and just load the same game and you can have a total different happiness and/or monthly income.-- Its totally unclear how different decisions impact economy. And sometimes decisions just take no effect. For axample: I built a harbour. In one a game, this was a huge boost tho the industry and on another nothing happend at all. That lack of infromation is frustrating.-- Bugs... I just mention two obvious ones:                -  Game crashed multiple times while loading saved games or while starting the game.                - After leaving to the main menu, some menu points were english but my settings were german.

Can't get it to go full screen-because i wanted to personalize the graphics and now i can only see half the screen. i havent even created my first district yet. Wait untill the price drops and they get it patched. They made an open beta is what im saying. Get it patched developers-my condolences to everyone else to pre-ordered.			"

A real time strategy game that combines roleplay with empire-building, in a delightfully intriguing political simulation, to sweep you across the stage of two centuries of world history. After playing the Korea scenario in Civ V, it hit me that the only thing the game lacked was some real politics. Well, here it is in Urban Empire. The game is a mash-up of the Democracy series with the Civilization series, and plays with as much strategy as Plague Inc. There is also a heavy role-play element.Narrative: The story is a sweeping saga that spans 200 years in a small Austrian Empire backwater. The game presents four families. You start in era 1 with the ancestor of 1 family and build your city as an appointee of the emperor. Meanwhile the story of your family, your empire, and the world is revealed in the backdrop by flashing newspaper covers and random events triggered by the backstory. The events give you a choice of responses to make, with outcomes which will heavily affect both your stats and the direction of your game. It’s high in player agency and the roleplay is as satisfying as any rpg. The devs at Calypso Media have combined so many genres in one game, as to be ground-breaking.As your character ages, and you learn his story, he will pass the city down to his progeny. Some of the descendants of each family are female as well as male. This pc aspect is pervasive, meaning that you will face racial, sexual, and political issues throughout the game, as you move from the Industrial Revolution, through the sexual revolution, two world wars, and a cold war. But, war is not a direct feature of your life in this backwater. It’s all there in the background of your provincial life, making for a nostalgic experience you won’t want to miss. You will be sure to find much replay value, as you explore the stories of each family. Your story (and your job-security) will change mid-game as the empire fades, and you will then have to face a merciless 5-year election cycle. The council parties seem to forget quickly the years of dedication your family has given to the city then and you have to prove your worth, or maneuver and backstab your way through the rest of the game. My first game ended in that 3rd era, after the 3rd election. But, I moved on to another family for the 2nd game and achieved a very fun time victory by surviving to the end of the 5th era in 2020. There are also Science, Economic, Political, and ‘Remarkable City’ victories that can be obtained. But, these are much more involved than the typical 4x fare. Mechanics:Though simple to learn, the game has much to be discovered through multiple play-throughs. The interface is clearly labeled, with tooltips that are informative and useful. The tutorial can be activated in a game to get you started. It merely describes the WASD controls and the basic moves that you will be using to play the game. Most everything else is easily discovered by checking out the User Interface.  You start by placing a district in a spot on the map. You are able to set the dimensions, the density, and other features, along with adjusting the shape of the roads. But, Urban Empire is NOT a city builder. You will not find the mindless micro-managing in this game. That’s all done for you by the game engine. You define the spread of residential, commercial, and industrial buildings. Then, as they are built by the engineers and your district expands, you may select buildings to view the population and business stats. You may choose to endorse a building, move it, or destroy it altogether, as with whole districts, if it is losing you money. Colorful lighted symbols appear over different buildings frequently, notifying you visually of changing stats, related to the numbers all displayed directly above the map in the toolbar. Here, you may choose to micro-manage the industry, especially if you are the OCD type. But, even if you just let the district run itself, it performs well. And the stats screens will tell you if a district is still profitable or not. Much of the game takes place in the Council screen, where you see the political parties, vote, pass edicts, make appeals to get your agendas passed, blackmail opposing parties, and other general political intrigues. This is perhaps the most fun aspect of the game, as you will find great glory in forcing your will on the city as it spans the ages.The camera controls are great, allowing for two different ways of viewing the world. In standard play, you are locked-in to a low horizon almost top-down view of the map for building and control. This can be fully manipulated 360 degrees by Q & E and pressing the wheel. But, pressing F10 will launch the screenshot mode, which gives you a skyline view of your whole empire, without the overlays. While in F10, you have the same camera controls and are able to zoom in and out as well. The tech cloud in the game is great. Components from each era are webbed within the next era, and you expand outward as the centuries unfold their sweeping changes for the world. You may choose to skip certain techs altogether, or skip ahead to future eras if you’ve made the right connections. The techs go beyond the typical, to include sociological elements of societal and political change as well. You may choose to adopt or ignore any civil rights. And, they are not required to win the game. Besides the families in the regular campaigns, the game currently includes 3 scenarios, which I’ve not yet played and am anxious to get to myself.Graphics:Some gamers have reported dropping framerates, to which the devs always reply. By lowering graphics settings and tweaking the settings, I found a wide range of performance. But, some of the settings appeared to be nonexistent, as in the fog which is apparently not in the game. There are lengthy loading screens, like in the Civ series. But, the game looks great.Art/Audio: The art style is what Civ VI could have been if the franchise had NOT chosen to go with the cartoon art map in this installment. I myself love both the art style of Civ V and Civ VI, though many veterans of the genre were not as thrilled with the loss of realism. In Urban Empire, you find an environment that is reminiscent of Civ V’s realism and modern. But, it is much more detailed, giving a range of historical costumes and scenery to set the stage for a tale of epic proportions, though provincial. The water moves, sound effects accompany, and the ‘mayor player’ is immersed in the environment of a German-esque island coast. The soundtrack itself is comprised of a sweeping range of orchestral music from Tapani Siirtola, who also created for Assassin’s Creed: Unity, among other notable titles. I found the complete audio files in my Steam music library free. My favorite track is a lovely melody called ‘Emerging Vision,’ which is both haunting and inspiring. The voice acting is in high quality audio by Alan Orpin, appearing mostly in the reading of quotations that appear after researching techs.Pros: *Urban Empire is an artform/ not just a game.*Political Intrigue that will have you controlling the Council *Roleplay with a historical flavor*City Ruling simulation *Ground-breaking & genre-bustingCons: *Framerates are still being tweaked according to the devs.*I’ve spotted a couple or three typos and grammatical errors. *The game is pricey. I don’t forsee a drop in that price though, as it’s worth the cost with replay value.For story and gameplay that is both smart and sophisticated go build your own urban empire. Much love, and art, and love of art have been immersed in this inspiring work of heart. I highly recommend Urban Empire for all who love strategy games. And, I think all game devs and collectors will want to experience how narrative, roleplay, and strategy have been combined in this next-generation video game. "

												I saw a video calling this ""Tropico like"" but sadly it doesn't seem to have any of the charm (but then again Tropico 5 was a huge disappointment too so maybe it's time to just write off Kalypso entirely).This game really needs a better tutorial - the tutorial in the game left me going into massive debt with no clue how I can actually affect anything (if you don't massively increase taxes you can barely pay for the school you have to build for the tutorial, never mind the grid upgrades you are later have to build as part of the tutorial).  You occasionally get asked to make certain decisions, but with no way of knowing the result it might as well be random (e.g. ""vienna style"" gas lighting vs ""french style"" gas lighting vs ""british style"" gas lighting - how the hell am I supposed to make an educated decision about which style of gas lighting is best for my city?).What's more, despite picking a ""campaign"" I never saw any objectives or any hint as to what the goal of the game might be (hit some target population? hit some target income? hit some target tech level?). It just looks like Simcity with everything removed (RCI is chosen for you, roads are picked for you by the game) with ubiquitous time wasting votes which keep playing time wasting vote count animations every. single. time. If there is fun to be had I didn't find it and I am not invested enough to give up my refund to find out.			"

												I was really looking forward to this game after watching Writing Bulls Lets Play. But the game has some of the bugs he was mentioning in his Lets Play and if u try to make sense on what desicion is the right one in every situation, you will be frustated by the ""random"" game response. You can just influence every political party the same way. You can build industry and the left wing supports you, while the party of the worker does not, even if there are not enough jobs. The idea is great, its just the implementation which seams to be pretty random and not at all realated to ""real world potics"".			"

												Great promises, but disappointing.Politics as a new focus in a city builder/manager? Great! - I love city-simulators, played them for 20+ years...I will refrain from listing any pros, as the cons far outweigh any pros and until fixed, I would strongly recommend your money to be spent elsewhere!Summary:Lack of controlTedious and repetitive political mechanicsAbysmal performance issuesWaiting and frustration guaranteed - for the majority of the time.Elaborating the cons:1. Political part is tiresome and repetitive: Sadly the game is poorly executed, as every action requires a vote, however realistic that might be, it means that changes takes ages: All your city districts takes a vote to change, which quickly becomes tiresome and repetitive. Imagine you want to roll out electrical grids in your entire city, before you are done you will have spent 20 years tediously modifying a district, waiting on the vote and repeat. My recommendation:Perhaps some unlockable ability that a mayor can modify within certain thresholds before it triggering a vote or a similar mechanic, or at least removing the constriction that only one ""modify district"" vote can be active at a time. Perhaps increase political interaction, such as more access to voting groups, ability to do campaigning (both for mayor elections and city council) and the ability to choose a political party, as well as interaction with other cities such as trade or infrastructural connections - not just the horrible ""twin cities"" mechanic that is currently the only inter-city interaction available. 2. Info and theory crafting in this game is so bad it hurts: You can, if you look into city statistics get info about traffic congestion, but the consequences of traffic congestion are not apparent. Need for certain zoning such as industry or housing seems important but after 15+ hours I still havent worked out exactly hot to satisfy it, perhaps because changes happen so slow that I have moved on to trying alternatives before the initial attempts effects kick in. Similarly it is not clear what exactly the different citizen parameters do to the game, health, security and happiness etc. all seem important, but as long as they stay in the green they don’t have apparent modifiers to the city.. (?) I would love some percentages and modifiers show here and there.3. Performance issues are by far the worst I have ever experienced: I just upgraded my graphics card, and even on lowest settings, speed 2 (out of 3 speed settings) still lagged - I spent about 10 hours on one play through, which was a pain. Granted, I maxed out my city size, but that should really not be an issue. If you want to avoid performance issues, try keeping your city at 1/4 of max size or so (Fun isn't it?).4. Combined with the above, the lack of control and info and the bad performance, the game just becomes painfully boring and frustrating. The last 100 years of gameplay was, for me, just setting to the max speed and answering every vote that showed up until the game was over.			"

												I saw some Let's Play videos of this game before it was released and seemed like something I would enjoy.  I had fun with Tropico, and adding additional politics and personal motivations into the game mechanics seems like a great thing.  Sadly, it really doesn't work out that way.Basically you are playing a choose your own adventure game, inbetween extremely long periods of sitting and waiting for something to happen or constantly having to brow beat the city council.  The game fails to involve you as a player more than getting to pick one of two or three options to a story based event, many of which don't explain the mechanical result of such.  And as far as not explaining, the tutorial is horrible (I will give credit that you can now disable it, which you couldn't for a time) and drags on for ages.  The tooltips are vague at best and just don't work at worse.  The council will always oppose you, just so you have something to compete against, and even if you cater to their needs you still have to burn your goodwill to get votes through.  And if you city ends up stable and making money you are just sitting waiting for the next tech to roll around so you can repeat the same cycle of picking a district upgrade and/or edict and spending your goodwill to get it passed.All told, if you want a city builder play City Skylines.  If you want a politcal simulator, play Democracy 3.  And if you want more Tropico, just go play Tropico, because Urban Empire fails to be a good game in any of those cases.			"

												I don't recommend to buy this for now. Eventhough it has very unique city management system, there are some bugs and it is pretty annoying. The game was frozen 3 times already so even I couldn't finish my tutorial...currently I'm using Korean translated version and I think it possibly couses more bugs. For example, if I change the city's name in korean the basic key set 'w,a,s,d' of camera movement doesn't work. I hope it will be fixed soon andI decided to leave it for a moment until those bugs fixed.or If you can enjoy some bug experiences, well it is up to you.아직 사지 마시길 바랍니다. 게임 플레이자체는 특이하고 신선하게 느껴졌는데, 아직 자잘한 버그가 많아요. 플레이 도중 버그로 재실행만 3번 정도 했습니다. 사실거면 핫픽스나오는 거 천천히 보면서 나중에 세일할 때를 노리세요...ㅠㅠ "

												Extremely overpriced game ! I got it on sale for 19 euros and i still feel it's too much for it.. Very clunky and busy interface (overly complicated) and it really does not bring much new to the table. The graphics are the only thing that i like and they are not that great anyway..Instead of this i would buy Tropico 3, Tropico 4 or even Tropico 5 and i will get so much more in return than this game.

												I really like the idea behind the game.I don't like the huge number of bugs (some are game breaking: in the political screen when I want to see what my options are, (in the pleading, demanding, threathening submenu there isn't any way to return to the previous menu and you are forced to choose something), missing tooltips, ...The society has not reacted to anything I did nor do I really have any options to sway their opinion.(There are some minor events that influence the popularity of some specific political party but that's about it. I find myself doing the exact same thing over and over again and can't help feeling some major features are missing.Especially in the political system, it is just too simplistic.Don't buy the game until it has been finished and gone through quality control.

												An interesting idea, shallowly created and poorly executed. That's really all I can say for it. The political aspect seems to be a crapshoot which encourages you to essentially not engage with it because trying to will almost always result in all of the political parties hating you, while not engaging with it will have them all basically rubberstamp whatever services and districts you wish to place down. Beyond placing distrcts and services, there really isn't anything to the game. Not worth it's stated price-tag.			"

												I want to really like this game; I expected a more indepth and political Tropico 3/4/5. Tropico's politics were tight but felt natural; if you worked at it you could make any voting block your reliable supporters and grow their numbers which also tended to anger their counterparts. Winning elections and not infuriating people into becoming rebels was a seemless part of the challenge of making a profitable island. Urban Empire, despite being all about the politics fails to keep things are clear or as simple to grasp as that. In fact I feel that a political party's feeling about anything at any given time is up to luck. There is no way to identify a solid political party that will have your back and who will actually support your re-election seems random.And let's face the elephant in the room, this game is heavily biased in the Liberal-Socialist wing side of politics since the State Laws are almost exclusively Liberal or Socialist in nature and are clearly railroaded to happen sooner rather than later. Let me return to Tropico; yeah it made sense that Tropico was more on the Socialist end being a banana republic under good old El Pres' but the Capitalists Faction would constantly tempt you to open up and if you didn't they would clearly and angrily oppose you. I feel none of that from opposition parties in Urban Empire; once the Edict or Law passes it is untouchable and no one seems to care anymore. No one cares about anything! I feel no passion in anything! It's a dull boring march to becoming a Unionized Heavily Taxed Welfare State and no one in the actual city seems to care! There is no protest or fanfair, no one rallies around a party to counter my changes or gets angry when a bill is voted down! I know politics is dull and thankless but I struggle to believe there are living human beings in my city and not just buses!Sadly, I knew this game would be a letdown. I had expected the lackluster city management but I always hoped the Politics would be interesting. It is just not.  "

												Don't buy this game. It's a nice idea that you have to pass almost every decision you make through a parliament-eske vote. But that is it. Repetitive mechanics kill any feeling of 'playful experimentation' from the beginning. This game excels at that.I've read a comment from the developer that the player shall continue their experience further so that they can learn the true potential of this game. But, the longer you play the slimmer are your chances to get this game refunded. Really, as of now this game appears to be the same kind of vaporware/ripoff as No Man's Sky. I have no trust left for this kind of ""trust me, my game is nice"" developers charging a full price.I'd rather pay 20$ for a Cities Skylines add-on featuring some city parliament which naturally limits your god-like mayorial powers than paying 45$ for THIS.

For those who are interested in this game please read up on the reviews and disscussion boards, before buying I think this will be a 50-50 review game. Now that I'm pass 20hrs, I hope my neg review counts.... It would be a good game if the lag issues was addressed, and the confusing game play when it comes to economical play in this game. I.E I was in the 50s and no hydro, still dirt roads, one grammer school ect. due to placing one item you end up in the Neg. A dev only asking for our system specs, not addressing any of the issues, but hey check this link which has 0 information.			"

												First and only review I've done.  Game was good for the first 2 hours, lacking minor bugs expected for a newer game.  I finished one game, hoping that somewhere along the way, something interesting and unique would happen that would spice up the game.  It did not.  Bland, no replayability, had potential but was not realized.			"

												Did expect more from the game. It looks nice but the Simulation of politics is very basic and repeat every time. A little bit of a story there but unfortunately there is no real depth in the game. I tried to get a refund after 3,5 hrs of gaming but steam won't let me as there a lot's of graphic issues after a certain amount of time. Sorry Kalypso and sorry Steam. Kalypso can do better, remember Tropico. It is not worth the money, maybe 15GBP. Now I have a game which is buggy, and makes no fun at all and diid not meet my expectations. Great idea Kalypso to try this Genre but you need to put more efford in.			"

												Extremely promising game. I really, really wanted to like it. You take charge of a city and have to manage building it in your vision and the views/votes of the political parties.The UI is terrible (Red means lower, Green means higher, regardless of good or bad) or unclear (-5% demand for a product means the business needs 5% less to stay profitable?!?!) Has a lot of potential, but really needs to be patched up.			"

												Would not purchase at this time.  Minus all the bugs that I will assume will eventually get crushed which make the game currently unplayable (vanishing money, etc) the entire premise is BS and the developers really made zero attempt to hide their political biases.  The game promised a political (mayoral) city builder but honestly there is only one acceptable path forward if you want to ""succeed"" at the game, Progressivism.  You try and run any economic or political method and the game becomes either impossible or near so to play even if real life says otherwards.  Not asking the same difficulty all the way through but the game is so biased as to make it unfun, ditto terminology for example, i.e. ""Relax minor sodomy laws"" isn't +1 GLBT rights as GLBT rights A) Weren't a city issue and B) the term didn't even exist until the 1990's basically.  Nobody gave a flying !@#$% about GLBT rights in era 1 or 2, at best you should say ""Gay rights"" or even ""homosexual rights"".  Also decisions should matter, i.e. there should be positive aspects to rejecting gay or women rights (because there are in real life) and their should be negatrive aspects to approving them (ditto) though we can hem and haw over the percentages, point is games like this should offer tradeoffs as no measure is 100% positive, most aren't even majoirty positive.Figure out what you want to make this game and then make it that way because right now it's just a Progressive wet dream if they were God to show everybody else the errors of their way.

												This is a painful review for me to write, but I am going to give this game two thumbs down. This game is awful. I want it to be good so badly. It is such a frustrating game that is fun to play through the first era, then everything after is miserable. Quick breakdown of how every game has gone for me:1. Start game and build city that has lots of income and happiness through the first era2. Second era begins and happiness requirments instantly change with no time to comply3. Reduced happiness kills your economy so that you have no income. 4. No income results in less happiness, and the political parties will not support you on anything that could save your city.5. Now that you cannot add any infrastructure to your city, it falls severely behind and the third era pops into action and it is game over.Idk how many games I have played now, and how many different approaches I have taken to growing my city, but they have all failed. I have played the tutorial, and even through following the tutorial the same exact disasters happened. It hurts to play this game. Every start feels like the begining of something great, only to turn into something that is so frustrating that you want to put a hole through your computer screen. Devs... fix this. I understand that you want to make something new and you did a good job of that, but your game is not fun. It feels like you are trying to set people up for failure in your game. Why is it that a single service costs the total amount that an entire district of majority industry and commerce can make? Why is it that to add one level of development it is significantly more than an entire city with 5 prospering districts incomes combined? Try this, when adding infrastructure to districts, lets have it give an actual visable impact on the economy that benefits the player.			"

												A politcial city builder of sorts that tries a new approach. Unfortunately both the city building aspect and the political apsect of the game are quite shallow, leading to an unengaging, and somwhat of a bland experience.A nice idea that was let down by flawed design, mediocre gameplay and performance issues.You can watch my full impressions here

												TLDR; Political bias, price, restricions, and hollowness (Probably isn't even a word) Ruin the game :(*POTENTIAL RUINED*It's a real shame because i wanted to like this game a lot. I love city builders like Cities: Skylines or sim city. Then adding the political twist! Wow sounds great... Right?Well it just asn't executed correctly in my opinion. Everything feels hollow as all the choices you make almost mean nothing. It's just a balancing act of numbers, I never feel like i'm interacting with a real council, we don't even know the party leaders' names. Futhermore, this game basically forces you down the lefty root which is very, very frustraiting. Before I got this, I was exited. I wasnted to be the local Hitler, ruling over all my people with brutality. But nope, there is almost no role playing. You are always forced down the same root of Fenminism, LGBT and all that stuff. And of course, there is no negatives at all for voting for them, but only positives. Even if you wanted to vote against LGBT rights, your council will probably put it through anyway. It's a real shame that the Devs put their political bias ahaead of a fun political game.Big shame :(However, Kalypso are known for pushing out 4 £20 DLC's for all their games so don't you worry! If you want an adverage game, you'll only have to fork out another £80 to them until you may actually have fun for a game which you already payed £35 for! (Feels more like a £10 indie game)Dont buy!3.5/10 "

												So, I know that this isn't a city builder but a city ruler blablabla. However, the gameplay is incredibly shallow in most aspects. The concept is amazing and I think the devs wasted some potential with this game. The main issues I have with the game are, as I said, shallow city sim related gameplay you might be used to get from other games - which in itself wouldn't be a major deal if other aspects of the game would be more interesting. However, there is no real roleplaying aspect other than the occasional trait points you get (or lose), flavour text for characters and houses.Then there is the ""political"" side of the game, which is pretty disappointing. You basically have a bunch of political parties that shift in power. Wanna pass a law and parties that support it are in the minority? No problem, just tell the leader of an opposing party that you'll ruin his career or straight out threaten to murder him and there you go, vote passed. Zone out a disctrict or build a police station? Threaten people. Increase taxes, funding for something, strenghten LGBT rights from horrible to kinda horrible or get ♥♥♥♥ing elected? DO THE EXACT SAME ♥♥♥♥ING THING! Why is there no campaigning for elections? No political intrigues, managing your own party or whatever else politics could have been implemented in this game?A price tag of ~20 bucks would be acceptable for this game. I'd say factoring in the current price of €45 for me, I'd give it a 4/10. Disregarding price, a 6/10.			"

I would like to use personal funds and city funds to build, like a half/half combo, I would also like more info on some screens. More parties and the growth of the number of people in parties as in population growth. More grid options, Diffrent mayor governments would be nice. Overall it's fun but I felt like I was doing the same thing everytime.Also mod support would make this game amazing. P.s People are mad that I think the price is too high? I like the game, just needs more stuff for that price.			"

												Urban empire is a very niche game, despite of its marketing and initial price tag that suggested a quasi-AAA title. It decides to go against the critically acclaimed Cities Skylines, and it endorses Tropico's political system more than ever before. Why am I endorsing the game? They are going in a certain direction that games don't usually go - and as far as I am concerned, I like it because it's a difficult road and not many players nowadays enjoy the city-building + politics combo. Big time. And I think innovations need to be endorsed, promoted and helped.That's Calypso for you. They make awesome niche games focused on the city building+politics combo that just get better - first Tropico, now Urban Empire. It's just all about time - they decided to stop being lazy, go on the politics road and keep it up.If you dont like to read, then watch me ramble for 20 minutes or so: 


YouTube™ Video: Urban Empire is well worth the buy! 

			Views: 40		

			In this video, I explain why I really liked Urban Empire, and why is it worth to buy it.		

Lets take a look at the good.GOOD:1. The politics system really helps the game. It wrenches the control out of the player's hands, and while others would complain, I find it the best positive thing in the game. This is MFing real life. Political parties have their own views, their own agendas, their own principles, and try as you might, a mayor can only do so much. Ok, short of being the Green Arrow, I guess...2. They have chosen the perfect setting - the second half of the 19th century, when things really started kicking into high gear for the humanity as we know it - all over the world. I am very happy they did it.3. The different maps provide different challenges, and the player needs to plan for that. I like it.4. The replayability is good in my book. I have played 2 maps with 2 different families and it felt like a different game. Was it just me carrying over my experience of the first game? I don't think so. While the setting is relatively similar, playing to the strengths of your family is a big deal and enforces a number of different playstyles. And speaking about playstyles...5. Playstyles differ, and work. So far in my games, I managed to create a workers' paradise, where the lower class pays almost nothing in taxes, and in my other game I managed to create a technocratic society where everyone contributed and went tech crazy. I can see so much potential for roleplay here. I love it. I could say more about the system, but the female part of the humankind will hate me, and I'd rather not, because I am very much into women, as they represent the better part of our society!6. Last, but not least, the city does indeed change because of your actions, which is really nice to see. Whether it will be the buildings, the street light, hell, even the amount of people walking the streets, it's still a very welcome change from a player's perspective.Good, good, good. But there is bad, and it's a lot. 1. The game is easy. You will most likely be able to win it in the first go, especially if you already have some experience with city builders and how they work2. Prestige, while being an awesome thing, is used improperly in my opinion. It needs to be family/mayor based, and not accumulated throughout the entire game. Or at least make it so that you can't use it to overrule mayor elections - because no matter how bad you lose, you can still use prestige to stay in power. While the cost to stay in power does rise, if you are remotely good at this type of game you will win, and still sit on a very hefty amount of prestige. And about that...3. I just wish that Calypso will endorse the fact that gamers do like challenge. So far their city/politics games have been extremely gamer-friendly. It's like playing XCOM, losing the mission, getting everyone killed, but have a itty bitty little button in the corner of the screen that says ""Spend 10 Supply to win"" and by a snap of Q's fingers everyone is alive and all's good. Welp...4. Invalid district shape shouldn't have been considered as a game option, and district shapes should have been completely overhauled - especially in the types of maps the developers created. All those corners do not help the district building, people, especially in the way you made it. Inexperienced people will sometimes forfeit a huge chunk of the playing area just because of your ""regulations"". Thanks, but no thanks.5. Being a niche game, it promises more that people expect. I don't like it, as it misrepresents many, many things. The devs made it sound like it's Cities Skylines with a political system - which is something everyone will buy, and bite into - and be bitterly disappointed.6. Again, last but not least, there are bugs. I, myself posted a screenie in which an event cause the game to bug and got me like 7 million debt in a tick, even though I was easily in the positive amounts of cash influx - this immediately affected my game, as it reduced my ability to play the way that I wanted, and forced me to cheat (meaning raise a ton of taxes, and the parliament agreed easily, which also helped me later on) - which is a bad thing. Of course, don't get me started on the frame rate drops... Thank God I am a gamer since 1998, which mens I don't really pay attention to that, and it doesn't bother me much - but I know for a fact that it ticks a ton more people to no end.Time to interject before the conclusion...You might have noticed that I didn't talk about the graphics, the sound, etc. They are ok and do the game justice. What I am trying to say with this review, is that, even by endorsing this game, Calypso need to step up their game and understand where the industry is at. It's about time they introduced multiple difficulties in an appropriate, and dare I say MEANINGFUL fashion. It's time to get out of their shell and do the proper thing. I know for a fact that they have the capability to do so, as they have proven in with the tropico series and this very game, Urban Empire - they just need to do it in their next game, or they will always be the niche dev that makes good games for specific audiences, but never great games.Conclusion:I am endorsing the game because I am having great fun with it, and because I believe that the developers have what it takes to step up their game and make the next cities skylines with a politics system. It may happen or not - but it is hard for me not to get by the fact that I am having lots of fun playing Urban Empire, and that I find each family to pose different challenges - and as some of you might know, I judge my games by game hours vs value - and to me, this one sure as hell merits it. Each play-through lasts about 8 hours, and with 4 families, varying political systems, and roleplaying to boot, it easily overgrows its money value. Want to make an city where women do nothing else but give birth to kids to prolong lineages? You can! (and did you just see me contradict myself?! I bet you did, as far as positive 5 is concerned...) Want to make the ultimate balanced society? You can! Want to be the best modern society? You sure as hell can! I absolutely love the amount of options this game gives me, and for that - I thank it! Do you? That's a question you need to answer for yourself.			"

												I'd say that the overall concept of the game is great, however, it failed top deliver (for now). I feel that the game should most definitely be in Early Access. There seems to be a lot of stuff missing as well as multiple ongoing issues with what is already released. Furthermore, the game seems to be EXTREMELY taxing on my system, which it shouldn't given what little seems to be running. At times it's pulling way too much RAM as well as utilizing 100% of my GPU. For the size of the map and the relatively limited options presented in the game, it's hard to understand why the game is so taxing. Overall I would NOT recommend purchasing the game until they fix the current issues with it.			"

												The game is enjoyable at the beginning, but with the time going, you feel more and more headache in the game. The vital issue  to me is your income NEVER grows with the tech clouds, but your outcome does! That makes tax raising the only solution for the city finance. And at each stage, the game asks to meet some special criterias, which forces to invest huge money on infraustructures or services, but the economic return is merely to see.So if you want to build a Texas style city - low tax low service, you are better to try your luck in some other games.

												I wish I could recommend this game, but I don't see any way to get to that point with what we currently have to play.  There's zero strategy involved, it's essentially impossible to lose.  As long as you do bulk upgrades of districts when they go up for vote, you'll always have plenty of goodwill.  As long as you raise taxes regularly, you'll never be short of money.  No matter how unhappy your people are, it never actually reflects in the game itself.  It took me an hour on speed 4 to get to age 3, and the only differences were slightly different building names that essentially do the same thing as prior buildings.  Once you factor in the increasing demand from successive ages the new buildings do almost literally the exact same thing, since their higher bonuses are offset completely.  If you had some idea what most actions would do, it would help considerably.  Instead you normally have no idea what any option will do, although occasionally you'll have a tooltip for one or all of the options, although this is rare.  It's just currently not fun at all, and I deeply regret my pre purchase.			"

												The good: the game has a brilliant idea. You have either governance games (Paradox) or city builders, but this one marries the two ideas into a hands-on governance game. Few games such as this exist (best one being probably Tropico 4). I think this goes even beyond Tropico in terms of depth, with the existence of formal votes and political parties, so kuddos to the creators for thinking about such an interesting concept.The bad: well, the game gets repetitive very fast, as the political mechanics do the same thing over and over again. There is no sandbox mode per se at this stage, and the optimization is poor. Without the graphics or the underlying mechanics being something to go ""wow"" about, the game runs slowly and camera controls are wonky. Tropico 5 runs faster and has even better graphics, and larger maps.. Lastly, the interface is horrendous, non-intuitive and difficult to master. Fonts are small, and many players (myself included) had trouble saving the game (due to the insistence on a new save name) or in-game actions due to poor instructions. Sadly, on top of a fairly high cost (at €45 I expect this game not to become a DLC rally point), the poor features make me go for ""no"" for this game, and I intend to request a refund.			"

												I like the idea behind the game, I really would like to recommend it, but unfortunately cannot do so now; the implementation is not enjoyable enough. As many people already said, there are too many repetitive actions, and the politics game mode seems too shallow.Economy is really bad and mechanics behind it are not clear at all.Same events occur sometimes (in my gameplay I had event ""The Bridge"" 3 times in a row in ~10 minutes of gameplay).There are almost no city sounds. I expected to hear a train coming at least when I zoom in to the railroad and see a passing train - no, developers decided that it is irrelevant.There are some mistakes in words here and there; sometimes in city hall view when you appeal to parties your mayor says confusing things (for instance, I wanted to demand lefties not to vote for Labour Union act, and guess what - my mayor told them that it is ""their duty to VOTE YES on that edict""; that was really confusing, since when I used this option I actually made some of party members vote against the law, just the way I wanted).This one is unconfirmed since I have to play more eras to check this out, but from my current two eras gameplay I've got the feeling that game tries to push you into the leftist way with all these labour rights/equality and other commie stuff (I'm a right-wing conservative myself).This game has an indie quality and clearly has either to be really remade into a better title, or the price should be way lower, somewhere around 3-5$ would fit nice in its current state.

												Overall disappointment from a publisher behind Tropico. First refund I've ever requested.  Appreciate the premise, but this game just isn't fun and lacks visual depth throughout the city.  Can only zoom in to see a few citizens walking around :/ This game visually is behind the times.  Economy drivers are difficult to understand... I just thought it would be more.			"

												While this game has a lot of potential and could be a great experiance, I can't reccomend it because it is currently unfished. The optimization is very poor. I run games such as simcity, Tropico or even BF1 with no trouble, but the game starts really slowing down an hour or so in. There are also obvious problems with saving the game, naming districts and others which should really have been fixed before the game was released. Wait until they fix the issues before you buy.			"

												I really wanted to like this game, it has been on my wishlist for months. But ultimately it fell flat on my expectations. It is ridiculously overpriced for what it is- I would not be refunding it if it were a $5 or $10 game...but no, it is a $40 game, and that is ridiculous for what it is. On the surface, it gives off the impression of being a ""city builder"" and being complex, but it is not. Once you have played for an hour, you realise just how repetitive the game is and how lacking in content, diversity, and complexity it really is.Not worth the asking price.			"

Its slowpaced and boring, and I dont understand how things are supposed to work, if you raise taxes nothing happends to demande of the different zones.. Weird.

												Not the game they describe. This is not a Mayoral sim; it is a very shallow city builder with a political menu thrown in. Yes you can change taxes, edicts, which party is the most of in power, etc. However the only way to do this is through goodwill, no bribes, no actual threats, no assasinations, no political kidnapping (which was still very common in the 1800's), very poor blackmail system, etc. Everything's just horribly over simplified on the surface. You dig deeper and you find out the goodwill system is the absolute CORE of your political career. So an Imperial aggressive play style lands you in hot water fast. Imperials  want the same laws (such as freaking labor unions?!?!?!?!?) as the populists. Why? Because it gives a bonus to the people of the city if you pass it. How about workers safety? Sounds expensive to implement FDA and OSHA regulations right? Nope, implementing it increases sales. What the ever living ****! I mean I'd get more workers would want to work but higher safety should makes your profits go down not up. These devs  put absolutely no effort into a ""Real"" political system. Then you come into the horrible part, not only is the political system simple, it's also geared to the NPC. Let me explain, let's say an Imperial opposes bills that are trying to be passed by a Populist. You will lose council members (consistent votes) to that party because the people of the city prefer the party that benefits them most. So I allowed them to take power while using large amounts of good will to control their votes and the votes of the other parties. I ended up 6 districts in producing a very consistent 40-60k a month at 13/13 taxes. Then the Populists decide let's tax the people less (6%) and commercial and industrial businesses more (17%). 4 districts went bankrupt within 1.5 years, as I was completely unable to do anything in the council because I had almost no party members and no support. I'll also add that I was playing the way the campaign TELLS you to play. Whether they intentionally run you into the ground or not I'm not sure. Can't afford lights and roads or any institutions as there's a constant fluctuation in income such as making 170k a year then going -31k from everything going bankrupt with no explanation what from.All I can say is this game failed, and it failed hard. The entire system feels unbalanced, unpolished, unrewarding, and just simply put, not fun at all. Run, run far away. Go spend $5 on The Guild 2: Renaissance and you'll see a simple political system that still has bugs and troubles yet still vastly out performs Urban Empire. This is in no way worth $40, maybe $15 if they fixed...well everything.. But be prepared to wait 2 years. "

												The game brings aspects of politically-driven and city-building games that come together to create a unique experience. Utilizing a district zoning method with other controls (such as adjusting the density of the district to be sparse or tight-knit, or changing the amount of lots dedicated to residential, commercial, etc.), you are able to plot out the literal squares of your city. However, the thing that caught most people off guard is that you don't manually place buildings except for municipal services (like schoolhouses, clinics, or fire stations). Most of the changes that impact the city and change the outlook of things take place in the senate where you propose tax hikes/cuts, adjust funding, and issue edicts for approval. Depending on the relationship between the mayor (player) and present political factions and their spot on the political compass, they will ultimately decide if you are able to carry out your plans. The game is mostly a balancing act where you try to weigh it to your side. From time to time, the game will pose events that impact your contstituents and need your input, like if you support or want to abolish child lavor, support alcohol liscenses, or if you should enstate anti-pollution laws.I for one enjoyed what the game had to offer, and would recommend this game to any individual who wants a game to simulate real political functions and to also revel in making personal decisions about the citizens you reside over.If I had any critques about the game, I'd say that a neater user interface would be better, and to make alerts to the player more visble and last longer. Secondly, have the tutorial go more in=depth about companies and how to make revenue.			"

												So far, I really like this game. I've now gone into Era 3 with 3 of the 4 families, played on each of the maps, and I'd definitely say that there is a good base for replayability. I've seen it mentioned here that there are some choices that you're just going to want to make regardless of what you're doing, owning to general buffs, and that's true. It's the most limiting factor to the game's replayability. But I 1) don't think it's as prevelant as some are saying and 2) imagine that will be addressed in coming patches.That leads me to: yes, this is going to be one of those games that really is going to need more work in coming patches before it has enough staying power to warrant sitting down and playing it for ages. Depending on what studios you're used to (Paradox, anyone?) you may already be used to that sort of thing and are willing to be patient.I do agree though, $40 seems a bit steep at the moment. Still, I usually can't wait very long to try out new games in the genre, and I ultimately thought it was worth it.			"

												Disappointing, the politicking is ostensibly designed to provide some challenge but all the purpose it seems to serve is to slow you down (since you can only have one vote up at a time for rezoning/doing new districts/etc), but it doesn't. If you have money your votes will pretty much always pass. If your budget is messed up you can always pass a tax increase, most of the decisions presented to you are meaningless, and traffic, probably the biggest issue in almost any city builder is just not a concern because you don't lay your own roads. Votes are extremely predictable because even with the thinnest of margins visible the neutrals will pretty much always split 50/50.Might be a little fun but definitely not worth it in its current state. Knowing Kalypso the game will probably never be an actual challenge so I wouldn't hold out if you're looking for that.			"

												I really want to like this game but the way it currently plays is both frustrating and obfuscated. It really is a city builder game with a very awkward ""Do not pass go"" Council screen passing for the difference between Builder and Ruler. Ultimately it starts getting in the way. It needs to be streamlined to be less offensive to the continuing gameplay.Then there's the mechanics of how and why your city grows or doesn't grow. Very few of the factors are fully explained to the point where you can comprehend them and utilise or react to them properly. A very slight change to your city perhaps even a change to just the city's potential and not even to it's physical nature (e.g. upgrade a district to potentially have higher density buildings) and suddenly everyone might move out sending you into a debt spiral you can never recover from.Then there are story-driven decisions you have to make (will you the Major endorse X or Y etc). Some of them reveal their consequences in terms of modifications to various stats and some of them don't. There appears to be no rhyme or reason for the latter.The game is also pretty poor on the graphical front. Ignore the lovely close-ups in the trailers. You'll never be looking at your city like that and even if you do take a moment to zoom in it really isn't impressive in the flesh. As your city grows so does your frame-rate slow. Even on a massively overclocked i7 and watercooled 1080GTX it tanks completely as the city gets larger. Eventually it crashes raising the ghost of a possible memory leak. "

												I pre-purchased this game with a Steam gift card I received. I pretty much have all the games I want to play on Steam already so I figured I would try this out. I watched a few pre-release game plays and the game seemed okay.The game touts itself as a mix of politics and ""city-management"". It lacks very much of any deviation from what the developers 'intended' the player to go through. It is very mechanical in the way the player just 'pulls levers' and waits to see what happens. The order in which you make decisions for research feels like it makes little difference to the direction of your city. It lacks flavor as the player can only choose a few families to play, three maps without much character themselves, and a lack of politic actions. The political action is to 'make appeals' to the different parties and gets old once you do it 100+ times.This game could've been so much more (perhaps a mix between Cities Skylines and Crusader Kings?) but it lacks flavor and became monotonous very quickly. Not worth the price tag, even at the 10 or 20% off I bought it at. It reeks of a classic Kalypso game: second tier.EDIT:Another small thing that annoyed me was the lack of ability to zoom out further. I felt constrained to look always be looking at a small section of the map. The map up-close wasn't even that 'detailed' so I'm not sure why the emphasis was to be close. It's just something small that I bet could be quickly patched in to allow the player to zoom out further.			"

												Mechanically the game is fairly shallow. The politics are not terribly engaging or intuative, a lot of data seems to exist within the game but many tooltips are missing or otherwise unavailable, leaving a lot of the game feeling arbitrary.With only three maps for the core game it feels thin. They aren't very large maps, either. And while it may boast 1000~ dynamic events, most of them appear to be very shallow or poorly implimented, and don't seem to have long term effects other than changing one or two stats in a district.Visually it's not appealing, either, and while that is not what I nor anyone else should necessarily be looking for in a managment/strategy game, the layouts of the roads interfere a lot with how structures are placed and spawn in and create very unappealing environments.In and of its self, the game seems good, but many bugs and poorly implimented aspects of the game add up, and at the asking price of this game, it just isn't worth the price in its current state. It feels as though it is a mobile game.edit: While it is true that I only played on and a half hours of the game, I've looked at a substantial stretch of content on the game on youtube before proceeding, which confirmed my suspicions about the game going forward. The game could certainly have used a longer development cycle, I understand that the money could have been needed to finish development and pay people, but there needs to be more communication with the community in a more central place on the situation of the game if that is the case, or otherwise.

												Interesting premise, but poorly executed and certainly not worth £35.For anyone looking for their next city-building fix, this isn't it. It's very much more of a political simulator in the vein of Democracy or Fate of the World. However, I'm not sure that works entirely well with the city building aspects as they don't give you the flexibility to make the kind of decisions you'd like to make. For example, you build (or rather, seek permission to build) service buildings like schools and clinics which have an effective radius. But you can't choose specifically which blocks are residential, commercial etc, only the proportion spread within a neighbourhead, which means you end up placing services in less than optimal positions.The evolution of the city through the ages is a nice touch, as it the way the politics changes with the times. Unfortunately, it basically plays out exactly the same way with each playthrough, and other than a few shorter, limited, scenarios you ultimately have to play the same Swarelia story. I guess this will be supported with future DLC but at £35 already this is a bit of a rip-off, especially without a simple sandbox mode.The game also has a few bugs; and the economic model doesn't entirely make much sense. You'll be spending a lot of time just waiting for things to happen...Overall, if you can get this for £10 in a sale, it's worth a playthrough as the game is definitely original, but there's nowhere near enough here to justify a full price title.

												I will start by saying that I am having a lot of fun with this game. I love the concept, but the execution is a little... off.Most of the reasons for this have already been stated. The interface should be improved dramatically, it takes too many clicks and submenus to do things that I should just be able to do with one click. I have experienced my fair share of graphical bugs that have caused me to restart the game. The tooltips are not as helpful as they should be in explaining the effects of what's going on. For instance, it will say +1 Change in a certain area. Sounds good, but exactly what change was made? It just says change. That's not helpful at all. I also believe certain things are overpriced, and what exactly does upgrading your infrastructure even do? I've been using dirt roads forever with no problems. What is my incentive to spend all this cash on upgrading then? Speaking of overpriced, $39.99 is a bit much to charge for a game that should be considered early-access at this point. I feel like I am test running a beta version. $29.99 or even $34.99 would be more acceptable to me, and give me more realistic expectations for the game. As it stands, I cannot reccommend the game, however, in a few months when all the bugs are worked out and the interface is improved, I will absolutely recommend it. TL;DR Great concept, poor execution.			"

												TL;DR This game is a indirect city management game with politics that takes some time to figure out and is deceptively complex.This is a fairly unique management simulation.You are a mayor who is one of several stereotypical dynasties who has been granted control of a city.You take no direct hand in building it but must manage the city indirectly though successful political maneuvering of the council.The game has a very familiar city-builder-esque cycle:1. Choose and Object to build2. Wait for budget to be positive enough to sustain it.rinse, repeatIt adds a few other things to the cycle:Petition the council for funding of your project or fund it yourself.Intorduce laws and get them passed.In between all this you must regularly make decisions on various events both random and othewise presented to you. These events can have bigger consequences than they first appear.Early on in this game; I felt like all the options they give you in manageing the political parties were just different shades of the same flavor but the political system is actually much more subtely complex than I thought.Another thing that ended up being more interesting than it first appeared is the economy.If you enjoy games like Crusader Kings 2, Victoria 2 (really any paradox grand strategy or grand strategy games in general) You will probably like this game. If you want an outlet for your creative outbursts this will probably end up frustrating and boring you.			"

												City builder with the political aspects of games like Democracy 3, and a Penultimo cameo.I rather enjoy it, because with the political aspect, you need to pick and choose your battles. Always strongarming the council into getting your way WILL backfire on you.Build new districts when the economy is booming, increase taxes when it's in the red and always keep at least 10X the city's income in the treasury for cases where the economy turns around.The council is remarkably reasonable as long as you don't strong arm them. They will go against their own political compass if the economy is threatened or if it's booming and play to the approval of the public. If your city has high education, even the conservatives are likely to vote yes on progressive matters to avoid loosing approval.And if you have trouble getting something trough the council, like expanding infastructure in a district? Do it in steps as it's much easier to get trough.However if you try to play it like any other city builder and constantly strongarm even your political enemies.. you're going to have a bad time. So don't do it. Go with the political flow and try to focus on a healthy economy with your own ideals for the city being secondary.Doing as described above, I was able to expand the city into 6-7 districts before the first era was over and with a few 100k in income, which I managed to expand into over a million by the third era. As a result I only ever had to persuade or strongarm the council in 1 or 2 matters so far, and where the vote didn't go my way or I needed to get it trough despite the council makign it impossible, I just overturned it instead of trying to strongarm every party and move them into negative approval as i seemed to take a much lower hit from overturning the vote and the good will bounces much faster back from a 1-2 hit accross the board than from a 5-8 hit on a few parties.Also if you have trouble starting off and expanding, then start out by raising taxes 3-4% and as soon as you're in the positive after building the first district, zone another before you start adding services. It'll give you a bigger starting population & industry which will help keep your economy strong and make it much easier to continue expanding after adding services.			"

I have played to completion a few times, and can say this:1)	LLAAAAAGGGGGG - Regardless of others saying ""it plays fine"", if you are a successful mayor and get 10-15k population by around Era 3, the game will CRAWL. I have SSDs, 32GB RAM, and a 6 core CPU with HT. And it is literally single FPS by the time you hit Era 5. There is no way they didnt notice this in development, and yet they threw it out there anyways. Unacceptable.2)	This appears to be based on some designers idea of how politics work. Choices you make may or may not do what you think they do, and there is no information denoting what the overall effect might be. I don’t need the game to let me min/max, but I would like to at least understand who supports various initiatives, and what they are likely to vote for. It feels like there is some formula, but it is very unclear what that is. This makes every decision very frustrating.3)	When information is presented, it is done in an awkward and confusing manner. For example there are lots of stats about each district available, but none of them cover “what does this district need?” or “How do I address problem X?” So even when there is info available, it is still frustrating just trying to make sense of it.4)	The engine designer must have done the UI also because the way things like bonuses are presented is horrible. “Sales Bonus! Demand -10%!”. Even if the engine calculated a bonus as -10% for something, why in the world would you present it like that. Its just backwards.5)	Citizen desires, which they call The Wheel of Life are presented as offsets to the current era target. So you have a hard time understanding how much better you need to make things. They should just show it as “11/15” instead of “-4”. Even then, once you learn to understand what it means, how to solve that issue is unclear.6)	Nothing has any consequence. It doesnt matter what youve done or how you treat the parties. Vote for the most liberal policy available, have money in the bank and the coucil will love you.7)	Citizens dont care if its the modern era and they have no utilities and dirt roads. It makes no difference whatsoever. You can buy off the vote and people still drive around on dirt roads. If the game lets you see details, you could see people checking stuff out on their ipads while walking along next to the cow droppings. Luckily the game doesnt let you zoom in ( or out ) enough to notice.As I said, this game could be really good and after playing it a few times I can see where they were going with it. But the developer just did a very bad job of putting it into action in a way that makes sense to most people. Sure you can learn how to read their numbers, but I should have to work at learning the strategy, NOT at figuring out how to read their statistics. This is a $10 game with more polish than you would expect from that price range and a big publisher. For $40 its early access at BEST, and honestly, Im very skeptical of how deep the game would be even if it didnt have the litany of bugs. There are literally mobile games with more complexity, and better UIs!			"

												It was fun, but definitely not worth it. There are so many limitations, it's hard to know where to start.I find working with the city council to be fun, interesting, and definitely a high point in the game. Though, they could use a bit of tweaking since after awhile, they'll agree to any tax hike.The worse part of the game is the actual gameplay - you can't do a whole lot except build more districts and upgrade them one at a time. The economy also needs some serious tweaking since building districts is the only way to get more money. And don't even think about offering infrastructure for your people or you'll run out of money.I think this game could be a lot better if a few additional dynamics were added:1. Talking to concern citizens who would like your to grant permits, endorse their business, or to mingle with them (parties, balls, etc)2. Some ability to deal with the press would be a nice change of pace. How your interactions impacts your relations with the city council3. More district control - would make this a way better game. Instead, all I can determine is density and zoning4. Interactions with the outside world - The Emperor requests you to take in refugees? Crime issue? Things that an actual mayor has to deal with?In any case. The game is a great concept - but it's too limited, too plain, and just not worth the money. Maybe wait for it to go on sale or something.

												Ok, got enough hours in now to comment. Actually feels like I've seen it all already. I really like management games, just like I like games involving means of manipulation or sneaky means to achieve your goal. The prospect of having to influence the council to get my will really appealed to me. Sadly I have that the way it is executed in this game isn't for me. I will actually start with the Cons on this one:Cons- The praised 1000 events are boring with very minor (if at all impact). It's just a popup, you choose an option and get a mostly useless bonus or harmless malus. I had hoped for some event chains, something requiring action and something refreshing now and then. Nothing. - Economy often makes no sense whatsoever. The income drops and increases A LOT rather randomly and you don't even get a hint of why. The statistic tab is abismal. Most stuff you can't really read out of it.- The family choice is bland and rather meaningless. I usually approve roleplay elements like this but this is VERY basic and not fun.- I really hoped for more of an impact of the world's events on the town. There is (close to) nothing there. That makes absolutely no sense.- There really isn't much point in optimisation. At times the most profitable districts are the basic ones without any costly upgrades.- Based on my observations there seems to be only one real way to be financially successful (not spoiling it). All attempts to use other playstyles that based on the data given (demands for residents, commercy, industry) would have made way more sense ended horribly bad.- I see close to no replay value. The events don't offer any. Pros:- The approach for science is nice and refreshing.- Living through the changes in history e.g. the rights of women, the privileges initially reserved to few yet opened up over time is quite fun.

												This game doesn't feel complete at all. Tutorial is sketchy and superficial , and doesnt explain all the game mechanics to run the city properly. The political side of things is ridiculous. Everything runs on goodwill and prestige , which the tutorial conveniently left out on how to obtain it.The city building side fared better , click to add options to district and buildings.  However ,  what the tutorial neglected to teach was how to generate more money for the city which usually leaves players struggling to build a city they like.  In this aspect , sims like Tropico feels easier to understand. Another thing i hated was how boring it became as the the game went on. Things got repetitive fairly quickly. Research new tech , wait forever just to have the money to implement 1 of the perks of the new tech in a part of your city , fight the various political factions to pass through the agreement to build that single building or implement that new tech , which is fairly ridiculous to me. This game doesn't feel like it has a end game objective. Sure, there are victory conditions listed in the logbook , be it for campaign mode or scenario mode , but the campaign mode's background story is just that , a background distraction. There is no story or plot whatsoever to immerse in . I wouldn't recommend this game at all , unless you have hours to burn and you have really absolutely nothing else to play.			"

												I bought this when it first came out and I was hyped. SO. HYPED. I felt horrible knowing I had to write this review eventually that I waited until now, hoping the devs would release some redeeming content like Hello Games has recently. I wanted this game to be good. I really did. But on top of all of the bugs and glitches there is one simple fact. The gamep[lay is stale and repeats itself every 5 minutes. But not the fun kind of repeating Paradox provides, no, the kind where you don't feel involved in a world with people that have many different viewpoints and instead just want to fool game mechanics.I am sad for saying this, but this game sucks.

												This game showed a lot of promise, and still could be great, however, right now, its not. There are plenty of problems, inaccuracies, and drawbacks, but ultimately, what sinks this game is taxes. Income is seemingly random, shoots up and down massively month to month, and taxes need to constantly be raised just to keep your head above water. Its not fun to vote on taxes every 5 minutes,  by 1920 I had reached the ludicrously high tax rate of 95%, the maximum, and it still wasn't enough for basic level one services. The way the game handles money in general is annoying and unenjoyable. I love the idea behind the game but it's currently shallow, tedious, and a bit silly. I wish the devs all the best, and hope this game can be fixed, but right now I regret spending 40 dollars for 4 hours a gameplay before I decided it was time to move on.			"

												This is one of those games that you really want to love.  I preordered it in Oct and I couldn't wait for it to come out.  After a few hours of playing, I found it repeative and boring.  I was told to build a district and denied.  I don't know why people like one thing v. another.  I understand that the concept is to use politics and stragey to be able to do some things, but I see no rhyme or reason for why some things are approved and others aren't.  I've updated my districts with technolgy and keep losing money.  I have little desire to contiue to replay until I get it correct.  I honestly think this can be a wonderful game, but they really need to rethink the core with a huge update. I would like a free mode to let me just build and see how things grow based on polices and technology.  I would like to see how many people use/like the structors I've built besides just the political part - like do people really use the transportation system?  Are they getting sick and do we really need more clinics?  Plus 2 up on top for health doesn't really do it for me.I would like to be able to have more insight on the politics.  Why do we have to vote on everything?  What do the people want more in order to grow?  The demand bars also aren't doing it.Updates need to happen and then I'll update my status.  Look at your reviews guys and see that we need a change - bit time.  You have a great concept for a game - this can be a winner, but fix what needs to be fixed.			"

												tl;dr it plays like a really basic city builder that delays construction when you've gotten into the swing of things. This should be early access at best, it needs loads of refining to be anywhere near what they have been showcasing.It's 1960, my people are quite happy with my governing of the city, there's no water lines, sewage pipes or electric anywhere within the city. Despite this the Television business is booming, not sure how my people intend to watch the TV's, but I can't judge them.The roads are still the same old dirt roads from the 1800's everyone is happy to drive around their cars on this with minimal traffic problems.The communist party is quite happy for me to raise tax on the working class and lower it for the elite.The game boasts having an indepth political system where you need to battle with different parties to make changes, but there's no point at all in picking favourites to buddy up with as all relations with these parties will reset back to 0 after a couple of years. So you can generally treat them how you want.City expansion only becomes a problem if you have both a low income and low funds in the account, as then all parties will try to block all decisions you make. However if you're sitting there with a few hundred k in the bank, they will generally green light everything you want to do, like build an electrical power plant purely to export the power it creates.The parties as well are not really sticking to what you think they would, you will quite often see the conservatives pushing for social equality with the progressive sides trying to block these movements, and as mentioned before, communists liking to tax the working class high.The people in your city are quite happy to live with no water, electric or gas supplies. You can add these services to districts, but you get no return for doing so, people won't pay extra for them, so you're just throwing money away. They do claim to ""boost companies"" but again, increasing the sales of companies in your city doesn't actually do anything for your own income.The rpg story elements hardly do anything for the game, you can choose one of 4 families with different back stories and ideas towards governing. All switching between these really does it decide which events you're going to get, and they will be the same ones each time at the exact same time, you get a few outside of this, like parties wanting to make you honourary members etc. but they're mostly meaningless. Your character has traits, cruel, soft, opitmist etc. again, mostly meaningless. You might get the odd event pop up with a response option blocked due to lack of x trait, but refering back, your traits and what you say on these windows rarely matters.Until elections come around, you don't need to make your citizens happy at all. No chance of an uprising due to lack of healthcare, policing, leisure or anything at all. You can quite happily ignore all the demands of your citizens until the ability to vote comes along, and you can even try to prevent that for an extended time.Small aesthetic thing that bothers me. Why can I see loads of cars driving around my city when I've not even researched them yet. Also why do all the houses and shops have lights on at night if there's absoloutely no electrical grids in the city.The game had some great ideas with the whole political thing, you can even blackmail parties, but they just don't mean anything towards running the city. You can spend the entire game never having to speak to any of them apart from suggesting changes to the city and waiting for them to agree on it.And the fact that you can have a city with 0 utilities and everyone is ok with that bewilders me, but then you can't afford to give them to the entire city anyway.

												still buggy for a game with so little depth to its concepts. problems scale through time, but complexity does not. need more parks? build more parks. need more money? just raise taxes, doesnt matter on who, as parties dont differentiate.there is also a push towards certain policies, where certain playstyles just dont work. you either keep enacting progressive policies and raising taxes with pretty much no penality, or you do nothing.  I was hoping this would have more depth and a little more consequences for actions.Also Im not much of a fan of the load times even on an SSD, or the fact the three games I've started have all broken due to bugs while trying to load save games.

												Great idea, but bad game. It starts with bad performance (and my PC has i7 with GTX1080) then goes on to some shady mechanics - game says ""business has low quality"" but it doesn't say how to fix that. Or you build service with +7 to security but it doesn't change population security even by 1 point. Game doesn't say why. Then it all goes to miscelaneous bugs and in the end adds some frustration - you can't downgrade, only demolish and rebuild - combined with shady mechanics this leads to trial-and-error being quite painful.In the end - it's not something I can recommend.

												First off, I am a HUGE fan of the Tropico series, so I may be a bit biased. That said, this is easily one of the most addictive games that I've played in a LONG time.You really have to give it a chance, though. The first half-dozen playthroughs, it can feel like it is just unbelievably hard. Then I realized that I didn't need to wait for the game to tell me to add another district. Once your first district fills up, make sure your cashflow is positive, and build another district. That will set you back in the short-term, but then you'll get into a rhythm of building new districts, adding services, waiting until they fill up with industry/commercial buildings - and then rinse, and repeat.The real meat comes in the way that you choose to develop the tech, and add services or stockpile wealth. Will you try to up your salary early, so that you can bypass votes and build freely? Will you let the council do what they will, and save your points for a rainy day?I did, and that's where I really started having fun with it. It sort of feels like you're ""winning"" if your city has electricity before the 1800's are out. I unlocked contraception and womens' right to choose around 1860 in one game, and it felt like I had created a cultural Mecca out of nothing.Of course, I blew it in the next era by adding services more quickly than I was sourcing revenue or adding new districts, and had to start over. But now, I enjoy every restart, because I have new ideas for how to develop my city. This time, electric early and straight to assembly line. Oh, but I added electric lights in my first district too early, and now we're broke? And I spent all of my political capital getting here, and two of the parties are♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥at me?Time for a fresh start!TL;DL : Released today (yesterday?). Haven't slept, brain hurts. 10/10, Would disturb sleep patterns, again.			"

												In a nutshell, while I did enjoy this game enough to give it a positive, it certainly deserves the MIXED reaction.At a glance, Urban Empire is a city builder, but is billed a ""city ruler"". This is kind of true in some ways, but the actual mechanics behind the political side are very, very shallow. The general premise of the game is that you have to manage a town across 200 years, from the Industrial Revolution to modern times, while juggling the personal lives of your family thorugh decision-based events that don't really affect the game much, but add some flavour.The appeal in the game is, as with many city builders, figuring out how to do it right. There's satisfaction in getting a good cashflow, seeing happiness go up and optimising your districts. There's enough there to keep you hooked if you know the basics of not crashing your economy.The problem is that the game has VERY POOR player feedback. It doesn't really set you in the right direction - in fact, the in-game tutorial tips set you up to fail right away. There is a sore lack of tooltips, and many icons simply don't make sense at a glance. The exact relationship between residential, commercial and industrial demand is not made clear to the player. The underlying mechanics do seem solid, but they're not presented in a meaningful way to the player. As a result, it's very easy to make a poor decision and put yourself into an economic doom spiral.This is the main reason why most people dislike the game. The interface does not tell you what you want to know and need to know, nor are you given any guidance when your city begins to decline and you have no idea what you did or how to fix it.If you put in enough time to ""guess"" what you're meant to do to stay in the green, then you reach that level of contentedness, but there are other problems.The game seriously lags in later eras. The game speed slows down dramatically, even on powerful PCs.The political system is easy to beat. There's no need to do any of the political subplot events. Have enough money and goodwill and they'll past nearly every (good) law you bring up. The fact that EVERYTHING you do has to go through the council vote is extremely tedious when 99% of your decisions are guaranteed to pass provided you don't do anything stupid. I do wish there was a more streamlined way to get through the game without having to bring up the Council screen every few seconds.Overall, while I found the game fun enough, the lack of guidance and feedback for the player is an instant-quit for many.

												Sorry, this is Fantasy Gameplay with Functional Problems. You can't acctualy play the game without finishing the Tutorial. But the Tutorial does not allow saving the game. This forces you to finish a Tutorial which may last for hours. But the Tutorial has functional problems. Scrolling and zooming does not work well, and not far enough outward to see the big picture. So to see your whole town and important locations around it, this game fails. Tutorial arrows cover information you need to read. Double pop-up screens occur with ghost images over each other. Loading between different sequences takes a long time. Scrolling any menu makes it ""bounce"" at top and bottom of the menu selection list. Trying to place the rail station while using the mouse to scroll and zoom disconnects the placement of station command many times. After much trial and error in this Tutorial, you find there is only one fixed location for this station on the map but this is untold to the player, so it is not necessarily near where you placed the town at the start. So you can memorize where this was on the map, and then restart the Tutorial to restart the town closer to this station location. When finding it and successfully placing the station, the town council now votes ""against"" the station. This makes no sense. Why can the player not be aware of this ""opinion"" before researching and trying to build? And Why did they vote that way? The council does not explain their objection. Poor game design and mechanics. Also the Game as ""history"" makes no sense. A proposal for Womens Right to Own Property has approval of all parties, but a train station does not! It is the 1820's. Town development does not follow real town development throughout history. Even when using the Dense Grid the town grows like modern suburbia, not like tightly packed houses around a core or town square. Inventions are not historical. Political viewpoints are ahistorical and the Council disagreements on each invention makes no sense for city development. What does this leave? Pretty graphics and a contrived storyline, and you must always use the same contrived player characters. Besides being technically buggy, when the Tutorial does work it has a strange idea of ""history"" that borders on ""fantasy"" in gameplay. Not acceptable all around.			"

												My problems are pretty basic with this game: my inputs equal no change. Add gas infrastructure, which is supposed to ""boost companies"" no change in company income. The same with water/sewer service no change... I can add services to go bankrupt and make no change... business does seem to do better in mixed district rather than seperated so that I can't save on services...Politics is a joke... Want to raise taxes? Just run a deficit. Doesn't matter how you got there just jack up the taxes. Don't remove whatever you added that ruined the mix. Propose anything they will fight you tooth and nail, oh and count on the party that likes it to be the minority... Let them come to you and it sails through no problem. State laws? it may be unlocked but you cannot propose them and be a trailblazer you just gotta wait until some hidden metric proposes it. I can improve the quality of businesses by ""promoting"" them but gain no income again only for commercial business because industrial business does not benefit from endorsement what?... the tooltips are missing or unintelligible... I can ""cheese it up"" but the tools that are suposed to have some impact are equivalent to bashing my head against a wall... I was so looking forward to this game I even preordered, which I almost never do, now I am just dissapointed...  I had so much hope for this.			"

												This game is sold as a city builder that requires you to work with the council in order to get stuff passed. However, all your problems can be solved by threatening everyone and raising taxes to max, which in turn takes away any sense of strategy or any need to work with any groups. its a bad attempt at a simulation. I played way over the fun level because I wanted to see if somehow it would be rewarding the further in you got. It wasn't.			"

												It's a city council - voting sim, it's kinda interesting.  If you're into simulations and manager games kind of thing, this could be for you, but there's not a lot of micromanaging...  One thing, the price is too high, it should be around $20 or lower.  I'm giving it a thumbs up to support the genre and hopefully they'll tighten up the graphics on lvl 3 (joking). "

												TL;DR: Imagine that you have a large amount of candy. You do your best to maintain that amount of candy, while also giving some out to people in need. One day, a man comes up to you and threatens to falsely accuse you of a crime if you don't give the people more candy. Naturally, you give in to his demand, and resolve yourself to producing more candy in order to keep up with this demand. A month later, the man comes back and demands more. You oblige him again. This cycle continues until you have no candy left and all of the people in need are fat and unhealthy. The man approaches you and asks for more candy. When you explain that you have no more candy left to give, he kicks you in the balls and throws you off a cliff. The people that you gave everything to eventually starve to death, cursing your name for not giving them enough. Now imagine that you gave that man $35 to do this to you. That's what this game is like.I was very excited for this game. So excited, in fact, that I pre-ordered it despite my normal policy of never pre-oredering a game. The concept is very intriguing and I've always loved city-building games, so naturally I thought that this would be a good pickup.Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥was I wrong.First off, you walk into this game knowing pretty much nothing about its mechanics because the tutorial doesn't tell you how every action interacts with your city, so you're pretty much blind walking in. In addition to this lack of information, the game punishes you harshly should you ever do something ""wrong,"" so when your profits tank and your citizens start complaining you have no idea why it's happening or how to stop it. Companies go bankrupt for no reason, citizens don't work efficiently or buy things when they're not completely satisfied, and everything costs so much to maintain, so you're either forced to load a previous save or start a new campaign if something goes wrong. A ""wrong"" action could be as simple as adding street lights to your city, because they will inevitably bankrupt you while not doing a damn thing to help.The citizens are also extremely finicky and hold way too much influence on how the city fares. If *GOD FORBID* you don't give them enough areas to entertain themselves, they'll tank your city in minutes. You are also forced to pick tech trees that don't really have any real benefits other than that they allow you to place a ""small park"" or a ""theatre"" in your city, just so you can play the game for more than an hour without losing $50k a month because they can't ♥♥♥♥ing deal with dissatisfaction. Oh, and another fun bit about the buildings  that you're forced to place in order to keep them happy is that they cost exorbitant amounts of money to build and maintain, so you're pretty much doomed to go bankrupt eventually either way. I also can't seem to wrap my head around the fact that a town with less than 2000 people in 1892 needs *AT LEAST* a university, a hospital, several schools, several police stations, 5+ parks, a dedicated seaport, their own train station, electricity, subsidized water/sewage systems, and free ♥♥♥♥ing mass transit in order to not complain and ruin their city's economy. Also, the whole ""politics"" aspect of the game is essentially useless, except when you really want to save your city (because in that case they'll all ♥♥♥♥ing rally together to block you from making any positive change). You're forced to beg and demand that these city council members give you clearance to satisfy your citizens or save your city from bankruptcy, even though you've been granted your position by the ♥♥♥♥ing Emperor himself and should be completely free to ignore them. Another fun aspect of this system is that your ♥♥♥♥♥y citizens will vote for opposing parties in the next election if you don't completely satisfy their needs, so one party will carry half the votes in the entire council and can block any one of your political moves at will.Eventually, you're forced to hike up taxes to >20% in order to stop the bleeding for a while, but even that will only be a temporary fix. There's no real way to guarantee success in this game, even if you're only prioritizing profits and minimizing funding on the 10+ public safety buildings that you need in order to keep your town with 2000 people in it from feeling dissatisfied.New technology doesn't seem to help with any issues, either, because your citizens will still find a way to screw up your city. Edicts don't work, spying on other parties doesn't work, and frankly, the game itself doesn't really work. You'll suddenly be making $100k a month and you have no idea why it's happening, so you don't know how to keep it from inevitably tanking. These grace periods last JUST long enough for you to propose building up your city's infrastructure and spend most of your saved up money, but almost immediately after you spend some of your security cash your citizens will realize that they only have 3 theatres when they want 4, so they'll stop going to their jobs, all of the businesses and factories in your city will go bankrupt, and you'll be sitting there wishing that you hadn't bought this game or even attempted to succeed in it.This is the most frustrating game I have ever played by far. The thing that makes this hurt so much is that I was really looking forward to it, and that the devs completely botched the execution of this game when its premise was so good. I'm not going to recommend buying it until it's been fixed, or if it's $10 on sale and you're a masochist.			"

												This game is very unique.I have never seen another game where you try to tell people that even though we would be going in to debt shorterm it would be best in their best interest, but they do not listen. If you have ever studied much up on politics, watched political discussions or debates then this is very realistic. I rage quited when the people would not listen to me, which in my opinion is very realistic for being a political sim. For those people that give it a negative review because you spend most of your time begging, that is not true. If you know how to rule your city properly you should not need to negotiate with them all the time. But even still most of what politics are is negotiating and on that front this game does an outstanding job and shows you what politics is really like!			"

												Decent game but not without its flaws. I really enjoy the hands off approach to city building because I always felt that Simcity and similar titles gave too much free reign as the mayor in my oppinion. The game seriously lacks good explanation for what your actions are going to accomplish and in a few cases there aren't even ways to back out of a decision so that you can check the other options available to you. In general, it feels as though the upkeep cost of improvements are entirely too high especially there's no easy way to get a feel for or really impact the financial health of your city. Most of the issues plauging this game can be easily fixed with a patch, and as I said, balance and explination are my only two real gripes with this game. Oh, and before I forget, the political system also needs to be explained better with the different parties acting as they should (there have been multiple times I've encountered a party proposing something and when you go to the vote screen the proposing party is voting against the bill).

												The good: the game has a brilliant idea. You have either governance games (Paradox) or city builders, but this one marries the two ideas into a hands-on governance game. Few games such as this exist (best one being probably Tropico 4). I think this goes even beyond Tropico in terms of depth, with the existence of formal votes and political parties, so kuddos to the creators for thinking about such an interesting concept.The bad: well, the game gets repetitive very fast, as the political mechanics do the same thing over and over again. There is no sandbox mode per se at this stage, and the optimization is poor. Without the graphics or the underlying mechanics being something to go ""wow"" about, the game runs slowly and camera controls are wonky. Tropico 5 runs faster and has even better graphics, and larger maps.. Lastly, the interface is horrendous, non-intuitive and difficult to master. Fonts are small, and many players (myself included) had trouble saving the game (due to the insistence on a new save name) or in-game actions due to poor instructions. Sadly, on top of a fairly high cost (at €45 I expect this game not to become a DLC rally point), the poor features make me go for ""no"" for this game, and I intend to request a refund.			"

												I just hit the 2 hour mark on this game and I had to review it.This game is a great mashup of city builder and political strategy. Sort of a mix between Cities: Skylines, Democracy, Crusader Kings, and Civilization.The game is easy enough to work with, the basics are well explained though I've started over 2 times already because boy does it present a challenge.Growth is limited by both your bank and your political prowess, if you're too against the grain right off the bat anything you try and get done is going to be voted out while if you appease the parties you get some clout that you can use to push your own agenda.One issue that I have run into is the camera, it is much easier to use the keyboard controls for it than to use the mouse ro else you'll end up spinning the camera around wildly and never really get it into the right spot.Placing of buildable areas, called districts, is by far one thing that is really nice. With other city builders every road and zone was placed by hand, now you control how much of what zone type (typical RCI) you want and they are auto placed with roads already there.Want to build a park or a church? You can, using services, though the coucil will need to vote on any changes that are made, unless you're paying for it out of your own pocket. And yes, here you have personal funds as well as city funds and you get paid every month.If you like city builders, strategy games, or political strategy games this is a game you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of.

												Enabled Tutorial.  Task is to create a district.  I create a district just like it says, land area is green for proper size, but the ""Create District"" button stays disabled.  I'm stuck on the first task unable to complete it.  I restart game with tutorial disabled and am able to create a district without any trouble.  Restart the game with tutorial again, do the exact same process, now it works.  There is a bug in the tutorial for this very first step.   I felt more like a spectator to what was happening than having any control on the outcomes.  After researching Gas Lighting for example I get a screen requiring me to choose between 3 options, A,B,C.  No explanation of the differences of the 3 choices, or even WHAT i am choosing.  I would think gas lighting is gas lightning.  Research complete, install please.  But no, I have to choose option A,B,C. Select option A.  Now I see the effect of that choice being displayed but no way to back up and see what Option B or C does.  My choice of option A is locked in.  This interface makes no sense and no explanation of what or why I am presented with these options. The game has great potential but not there yet.  Needs more work.			"

												Dont buy it. I am nuts for political sims in any shape, and enjoy tycoon kind of games and played this game for 4 hours just to realize how lacking it is.... I was deceived by the idea behind this game (which sounded marvelous). However the game is very, very shallow... It is only a council voting simulation, with very few options and even less logical on the issues and parties. The votation on the council is the heart of the game (in fact it is the game, everything else gravitates this, for example you put light on the district , for almost no effect in playablility and then you have to approve it on the council, exactly as you would do to approve womans rights, exactly in the same way and with no logic on it). If you played The Guild 2, and was at the council of the city election, you will have much, much more fun and logic abou it..  I just asked for the refund, The game was not what was promised.			"

So i have wait until the end of the game, because maybe you seee there something from the familie story or anything. but now to the review the game is meh the people are not interested in how much tax they have to pay. struckture are useless you dont need to build them the are useless you only waste money if you build them. you only need to build distrects distrects ah and some buildings like the whole crap for the wheel of live.at episode 3 it comes the first time to the Mayor election..... but in this game you get prestige whit what you can just say mmmh you don't want me as leader ? i dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥here take prestige and i continue as Major... so now i have to wait for updates for this game because it is 0% fun ah maybe the first hour where fun because its something new with the elections but at the mid game or end game no one gives a♥♥♥♥♥♥on this elections because you pass everything you need and if you want to make new laws because you don't look everytime when you get some new ones and want to make 30 or more at once you neeeed to wait everytime at the elections and the best you also can't skip      it. you need to watch everytime the voting for any of the laws you want to make. yay its fun when you see it the first 10 times but after a while.... for this game i want more contend I want strukture and so on that i need them and that i get something from it when i build them not going to ruin. I want more techs because I allready reach all of theem at the beginning of epos 4 so I had over 1 Epos nothing to do.just watching the city grow. mh what else.

												This game needs 3 things very urgently. 1 more interaction with the emporor. 2. make the tools players have to increase income more powerful/consequential. 3. Make the power  a player's action count more towards rewards&punishment.    As of now what can a player do towards helping the economy is too insignificant compared to the random draft, the newspaper is reporting news irrelavent for the player such as what party wins election, instead of news of economy trends that the player can possibly make use of by adopting using tools available. The use of prestige is also very little that it's hardly even a resource to be considered.   And what really happens if you screw up the economy(the only way you can possibly screw up is over expanding btw, since the game omits so much detail for city development)? hardly anything, you just keep watching the unchanging city and wait for your income to sort out itself, passing acts/edicts hardly changes anything, speaking of the acts, they are so numerous, and inconsequential, especially inconsequential withregard to economy which is what a player would care most about, since money decides how much you can do in the game(the other is good will of party, which is meaning less, it's gonna recover over time and brings no threat). And what can you do when you are in a economy quagmire? not much besides maybe re-preportion the district, which is btw FREE by choosing the ""use personal funds option"".For the most part, you just sit and watch it sorted out. There isn't much you can do, nor is there any pressure for you to do anything, you might as well keep a small district and no one will come punish you as is the case for other strategy games where competition of other players or A.I. players constantly present threat and reminds you what you do counts.     The game seems striving to combine strategy game with city planning, but it fails to be the first due to reasons above and it fails to be the second because it tries to be the first and therefore simplifies all the micromanage details you'll run into in games such as Skyline.

												Unfortunately for me, the day before Urban Empire released, a problem with my graphics drivers was uncovered. This means that I had to play Urban Empire using my crappy integrated Intel graphics card and was unable to get more than 10 FPS at the lowest settings. Despite this, I played Urban Empire for 6 hours on release date with no more than 10 FPS. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Urban Empire and I am sure that I will put many more hours into this games (regardless of FPS).If you have played the Tropico series, Cities: Skylines and/or Democracy 3 then you will probably like this game as it is essentially a combination of the three.

												The Bad:- I can't save the game. - Very repetitive boring music. - Not much to do other than empty talk in city council. - Events don't do anything other than adding or subtracting a few modifiers. - Cannot customize anything in the game other than district names.- Camera controls are extremely difficult.- User interface is buggy.The Good:- There are political parties.

												The game has a texture bug that causes no textures to be created if you use a resolution higher than 1080.  I'm sure it will be fixed promptly but that is just inexcusable in a game being launched in 2017.  I have not been able to play the game as a result because I refuse to play it in a small box window as other users have reported that once it goes to windowed mode its nearly impossible to get it back to fullscreen.  Playtime is a misnomer as I left the game running while I researched the issue and did some other assorted things around the house, so again, I have been totally unable to play the game because of a texture bug.

												The game is BORING is a game about clicking many many times to get something aprove and watch the city grows itself.Unlike tropico you do nothing, there is no building and every edict is about clicking many times the mouse bottom to get it approve.Unlike City skylines you set a district and have no management or control on were the different zones will be and just watch it grows (do nothing else).for $40 dollars you can get tropico or city skylines or both and save youself some money and actually have fun playing a good city building game.

												I reccommend Everyone to watch one of the lets plays a few videos before deciding to buy. If you watch a lets play and like myself decide you want it, then you will enjoy it very much! It's everything you see in the lets play.You will spend lots of time in the City Counsil screen, just about as much as the city screen. It's very different from most city builders with the politics systems in this game.I like that i don't have to place all the roads and try to micromange traffic. Not that i did not enjoy this in city skylines, this game just focus's on other aspects of ruling a city.It would be nice to be able to attach multiple districts to a vote to pass say electricity in all of your current districts. Otherwise so far i have no problem with the game i knew i was buying!Edit: after playing longer i will say that it does get laggy later on even on a decent gaming rig. there are some things that are a little hard to tell what it means aswell. some people say it is to broken to play. i am not having any game breaking issues myself but be warned they are out there to some.if you are on edge because of the bugs and problems. maybe wait some time with any new game and see if there is any changes later you enjoy.

												This game is a good example for a good idea, executed very badly and poor. This is a political/economical city management/""tycoonish"" game. IMHO: The most important thing in developing a game like this, is game mechanics. Looks like they went for graphics instead. Because the graphics are very good for example. But the game mechanics are terrible. This voting and council system was a very good idea! But for god sake... the votes and the council itself are working like an idiot. For example: Sometimes even if you have a lot of money, they don't want to build anything. They vote no to train station, no to new district, no to everything. My first (and probably the last) try in this game was 2.2 hour. In this more than 2 hours i was able to build: 2 district, a police station, a clinic, and gas lamps. Nothing else. I progressed to almost 1900 but i doesn't feel any ""accomplishment"". Tho voting and council are working very badly and seemingly (other reviews) random. No real simulation or common sense at all. This is the part where this game fails big time. Not mentioned the sometimes inexplicable childish manifestations in game. I'm very sad.. not expected this. And for last but not least: Very overpriced!If you are fan of the tycoons, manager, simulation, games: Not recommended to buy at all (at any price)!			"

												This game is not for everyone.  I cannot stress this point enough.  It is not Cities Skylines or Simcity or whatever else you want it to be.  As a political ruling simulator, it is successful in its purpose.  If that is not something you are interested in, please do not buy it, as you will feel disappointed and review this game poorly because your expectations were not met.			"

												Pros:Deep economic siulation.Interesting look at inventions and social policies in the time periods the game covers.Cons:Somewhat easy Political system.  Having watched Quill18 and his struggles it may just be my own personal politics just melds well with the game.  I've rarely ever found a need to have to persuade the partries to do anything.  Its also possible Ill have more trouble in later eras.   If so maybe the late game will add more complexity to the council system.			"

												This is one of the more interesting city builders I have played. Instead of having absolute authority, you often need to receive council approval to accomplish tasks as mayor. This means you need to plead, demand, threaten, and spy on the political parties to influence their votes. You as the mayor have a resource, 'goodwill', for each of the parties. This represents your political capital and standing with that party. As you cajole, you expend this influence, and if you expend too much goodwill the party will oppose you even if your proposition aligns with their political agenda; they will simply oppose you because they don't like you. As time passes, new technologies are researched, which unlocks new edicts and services that can be purposed to the city concil. Solid 8/10.			"

												You're not a god, you're a mayor with your hands tied who has to answer to the city council and the citizens. It's a challenge. Good luck!Urban Empire has elements of Democracy, Banished, and a little bit of SimCity. But with a lot more variables. Yes, you can create districts, plop train staions and ports, or turn on the gas and electricity. But you're not doing any of that without the votes. You need to make decisions that gain you support of the councillors. While making decisions that are prosperous for the citizens and businesses. It's a balancing act.Although there are several pages of data to ponder while planning your decisions, the feedback is not explained very well. However, after playing more than two or three hours you start to see how it all works together.The graphics and sound are very nice. The UI is well organized and easy to navigate. I have experienced no bugs and it runs fine on my four year old laptop.So for those who are patient, with an interest in politics and city planning, give it a try!			"

												Awesome concept but the game... eh. (would put a sideways thumb but there's no ""eh"" option)Here are some ways you could improve the game and some thoughts.1.	I can overrule a mayoral race (That’s just silly)2.	Be able to gain favor points with parties other than by waiting or destroying blackmail. (Like by donating to the parties with personal funds or by asking them what policies they want passed)3.	Creation of “Bills” a collection of policies. a.	Reason 1: If there are 12 policies I can pass (Have the funds and are favored by most) I should be able to group them and pass them at one time.b.	Reason 2. If party A and B are opposite on the political spectrum and party A wants a policy but party B won’t let it pass, then group it with something party B wants. (You know like real politics)4.	Higher Density shouldn’t cost so much money. Why does allowing heavier density cost so much money? Higher density = more people = more in taxes.5.	More income methods than taxes would be nice.6.	District size limits is annoying because there are areas that seem large enough but aren’t and are just empty areas. At least let me make it a national park or something.7.	City wide implementation. (If I’m able to implement a service in each district and have the income, and funds then I shouldn’t have to go through each district and have to wait on a vote that will pass no matter what.)8.	More and better cause and effects. (Why is electricity so expensive and costly to maintain? Wouldn’t it be costly to implement then give me a revenue from selling electricity that would offset maintenance?) 9.	Is there no National Government? There should be actual effects of being a city within a national government. (For example If the national government joined/sided with the USSR I shouldn’t be able to be twin cities with San Francisco and Private ownership would decrease or something like that. And if you don’t like being a part of the Country maybe secede or join another country and have a way and effects of doing so) 10.	Am I not in a Political Party? This relates mainly to later eras but shouldn’t I be in a party since I’m a mayor?11.	Political Campaigning for policies and the mayoral race. (For example, if I campaigned for a policy but it was still voted down, but the people “demanded” for it I could overrule it without a negative effect and the parties who voted against it would see a drop in members)			"

												Ok well i thought i would give this game a fair chance, I always feel at least ten hours is neccisary to employ the tactics and varoius control changes that often occur between these types of games. I have played with all four familes and managed to get to Era 5 twice, gave up on Era three once and am currently in Era 2 with my present game. Swerve this game at all costs as it really is an I-Pad game nothing more. to say this game repeats it self is an understatment. There are so few options in the game that i have exhausted them all and the game plays the same regardless of which family you choose. Its limited beyond comprehension and any reviews (previews) that were out on this game before it was released that praised it should be ashamed of themselves as its so obvious they take back handers from companys and it shows on games like this.Its actually everything that is wrong with the game industry, I can not see how the heap of adons this company will make us pay for can make this game any better? Worst game i have purchased in years and agree that £9.99 would be acceptable and even then only get it on half price offer. I simply cant play it any more and have 1000s of hours on Civ etc. Which i will add if you have not played the new Civ its the best game i have played in years. Very polished, slick and enthralling, Urban Empire is not even a poor rip off of these games its simply garbage ignore all the attractive screen shots im on ultra HD and its really not that great looking. You alos have no involvment with these buildings and all you do is lay a grid that takes a while just to perfect the layout. Best thirty quid i have ever spent as i will never purchase another game by these cowboys.			"

												I'm astonished to see this game only has 46% positive. I think this is one of my favorite games to come out recently. The dynamics are unique, at least as far as anything I have played goes, and I really enjoyed them. Unfortunately, I think this is a niche game.I had a brief look at some of the gripes and complaints. Most of them center around ""not having control."" Well, that's just the thing, folks. In politics, mayor or not, you DO NOT have all the control. At best, you have some sway and a bully pulpit to try and influence things. I think what these folks are looking for is Yet Another Simcity and I have news for those people: This ain't it.To the company that makes this game, I'd say please do not be dismayed. The direction you are going in makes sense and does actually produce a fun game. It is unfortunate that so many people here don't enjoy it but I think that largely is because they were expecting something else entirely.I enjoy politics in real life and that is what attracted me to this game. I really, REALLY hope the devs continue to work on it and update because in spite of this measley 46% rating, I honestly think the game is awesome and definitely fun. It's just unfortunate that so many people who were expecting something else decided to brigade the game's Steam rating. I saw a mention of graphical resolution problem to which I cannot speak, but that is certainly fixable. I have had no such performance of graphical problems, but I have an I7 6700K, 32GB of 3000MhZ RAM, and a Seahawk GTX 1080, so you know, I damn well better not have any issues, lol!Anyway, great game. A really good political simulator, NOT so much a city simulator. It is definitely something different and I really enjoy the crap out of it. =)			"

												The game is kind of fun, but gets old really quickly. You burn goodwill to get votes. The only time its difficult is a change to the taxing. Other than that I don't have to do anything, and the vote simply goes through. The political system, the main selling point of this game, is super simplistic. It's cool for the first three hours, after that it gets boring fast. I kept trying to like this game, I really did. I just couldn't.Also, there are some typos and some placeholders in text left over, like when you get re-elected it says ""You are the mayor of [city]. Congrats!"" (or something to that effect). Thats right, instead of having your city's name, it says ""[city]""Hoping some new content gets released, cause I'm kinda stuck with this now.			"

												People must undderstand this is a political game snd thats why i Love it. The political game for those who want a visual parliment type game. You must  gain the support of the people living in your city in order to boost your party numbers. Grid lock fights over new districts. I would like to an easier break down of details or a better explanation, but so far im loving the game. Sorry the review is so short....have to leave for workIF U WANT TO JUST BUILD A CITY THIS IS NOT THE GAME FOR U. It's a political parliament game. The whole point is to have to deal with political parties and fight with them. When your party is in power- it's easy- when your party is the minority-  your bills arnt going to pass			"

												Fails to deliver politically. User Interface feels outdated, clumsy and stale with endless little stats that do not appear to influence the game at all, nor are they under control via policies or editcs. Game basically consists of clikcing through 3 major screens and watching the town evolve rather randomly. Surely one of worst value propositions in my library - applying for refund.			"

												I've seen a lot a people complaining about this game. I waited so long for this game but I did not pre-ordered it (it pisses me off). Well, finally after a lot of reading and watching walkthrough, I decided to buy it. Here is what I think :+ YEAH +- This game is UNIQUE: politics is the center of this construction game. I've never seen it before. So people complaning about the lack of construction in this game: yeah, you knew it! It was said a lot by the developers. I like politics and this game shows something interesting!- Long-life game: this game will provide hours of gaming. Each game will be totally different by your actions, your family and what happens. Maybe not totally at the beginning because some reforms are useful for your city ... But when Era II comes, it changes everything.- Difficulty is gowing slowly more and more difficult ... Era III was a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥- You'll need skills to get your reforms done after Era III because you'll get more parties (up to 6-7) with different opinions, different support of the population (their vote depends about the time but also what your city provides ! More you get schools, the less extremists have chances to get votes).- You get A LOT OF different events that can TOTALLY have an impact on the city: accepting a Lama from a contry, entering in a group of extremists to help your city become independant, chosing a wife etc... A real diversity which makes every game unique.+/- Why not but ... +/-- Didacticial: not so useful. Not mandatory also.- Scenarios: according to me, I did not find fun about it. It can be appreciated for some of you.- NO NO NO ! -- Only 4 families? Seriously? And you ALWAYS begin with the same character ... I would like to get more families and in each family, have a choice of at least 3 different people (because they give bonuses and malus to your city). Seriously, please! -> Be aware that ALL families are unlocked at the beginning of the game so you don't have to play hours to choose.- Public services: really really expensive. And sometimes I don't get bonuses from them. You say Gas help factories, but I've never seen mine getting more money. You'll get hard times guy to get perfect city quickly by upgrading it! You'll need to wait a long time before getting enough money to invest ... Unless politics accept your idea to raise taxes +10% in a year (they can accept +1/2% sometimes).- ONLY 3 MAPS! ARE YOU SERIOUS ???Conclusion:The game may not be, according to me, worth 45€. I did not ask for refund because I have fun with it and I hope they'll get us good upgrades (not DLCs guys). I think this game is worth 20/25€ for the moment (22/01/17). There's a REAL potential about this game. It is UNIQUE because of the system: politics before construction which is really good.I got hope. I give you a 5/7 "

												In a year this will be the best city building game this decade. All of the tools are there for Urban Empire to be the political sim of our dreams, and luckily all of the data the team needs is in the history of cities that already exist. A short list of things I would love to see (apologies if they are in the late game, posted this at around 6 hours played):Issuing bonds on city debtCity council understands that it costs money to create a functioning district. An industrial/commercial district will make more money if employees can pour a glass of water. Companies developing suburban areas (res/comm mix) frequently take on the cost of linking new subdivision infrastructre to utilities. That would be good. City owned utilities producing revenue. Waste removal/landfills as utility/institutionPolitical promises to parties in exchange for votesEarly membership in partiesMore options from the bully pulpit. I should be able to shame the Communists publicly for not giving women the vote. Mayoral campaign control and budgetingPrivate-public partnerships (by now you should know I'm Canadian)Light rail/subwaysMineral royalties from provincial governmentsFederal transfers/grantsSales/luxury/sin taxes (more than liquor and tobacco. I want people to pay taxes on their candy)Hydro-electric powerBidding on government contractsSex scandals ;)The great part is, this all seems easily possible with this design. I can't wait.			"

												I love city builders. However, games like Cities: Skyline gave you complete unilateral rule like a dictator. Tropico was almost the same replacing certain buildings with the idea of zoning that are prevalent in the other games. What I truly wanted in a game as complex as Cities: Skyline was a council that lorded and hounded at every decision I made through the giant political machine hovering over my fair city.Urban Empire was supposed to bridge that gap between city builder and political simulator. Marketed as “Be a Mayor Player”, whatever that meant, you had to develop the city through different eras and leaders through both physical development and the political challenges. You had to develop the city’s society through services while balancing the budget with the city council’s eye on your every move.Oh, what fun I will have!Or, was it a disappointment?Barring you the description of how the “Wheel of Life” (supply/demand for societal expansion) works, let me tell what worked and didn’t.I love the idea of a city council. Frankly, the only reason for me to get this game is because of the idea of city development through voting in a city council. The simulated cityfolk are still allowed to partake in the city’s market economy, but certain services in the Wheel of Life requires the city council’s intervention. Services like fire stations, parks, clinics, opera houses, schools and workshops require that the council vote over the improvement.I also love that the city council has era-appropriate parties occupying the council. My personal favorites were the existence of three parties: The Freedom Party (aka the Nazi Party), The Pacifist Party (super left-wing and liberal), and the Green Party (same like Pacifist Party, but more environmental). Political maneuvering with various parties with different ideologies isn’t a walk in the park. Liberal policies will be unacceptable to some parties, but with the correct development and policies placed into the city early in the game, you can have conservative parties agreeing with leftists liberal policies. The game’s city council rewards players who know how to political maneuver themselves through the era with the easement of passing legislation.However, even with such “coded rewards” written into the game, it suffers from a very counterintuitive user interface. My anecdote is with the idea of banning prostitution and the failed revocation of that law. While the game works on a dual axis binary of conservative/liberal and left/right which works to describe a political ideology, binary shouldn’t be used for your mayor’s decision on certain laws. Like real life, a law passes or fails through the vote of the city council. However, your mayor can only push for a law ahead. If you were to personally revoke a law and convince political parties, they will not push for the revocation. What needs to be worked on are the clarification for the poltical choices of Pleading, Demanding, or Threaten a political party. The developers need to add an additional button to show whether a mayor is pushing to support or oppose if the player makes a mistake.Speaking of mistakes, the performance of this game slows after building a lot of districts. As my trams in some districts zigzag their way through town, the scrolling speed to and fro the city is hampered as building textures load slowly or having serious graphical glitches. The performance has been problem since Tropico 4. Kalypso and the development team at Reborn Games need to calibrate and fix these issues if they were to create sequels. I understand the simulation games are the ones to usually suffer performance issues (like Cities XL), but albeit the game being playable, it becomes an absolute dread as the game stutters dealing with new simulations to compute. Mind you, I was also running my Performance Monitor next to my game and it is a RAM-eater, taking up 7 GBs of memory to run this game, even after adjusting graphic qualities to its lowest.In conclusion, the only reason I am recommending this game is due to its uniqueness of it being both a city-builder and a political simulator. However, I would love the developers to start thinking of this game like a Paradox Interactive game, giving us greater freedom in creating a character and the political situation around the player. I would like them to solve the major performance issues that made this game somewhat unplayable in future eras of the game. Personally, I would return to this game again once they have patched some of the performance and UI issues.			"

A novel game, with an interesting premise, and little handholding (which appeals to me).Govern a city for 200 years, across 5 generations, and attempt to achieve one of 5 victory conditions (ie ala Civilization). Seems like a fairly vanilla premise, until you account for the fact that you do not have absolute power to implement anything.Much/most of what you seek to do will require city council support (via a vote mechanic)  before implementation. Within the council you will deal with a variety of party blocks, representaing a slew of political idealogies, that vary by era. Party support for your proposals, depends upon their ideology/core values, the current economic situation, their relationship with you, and player initiated political interaction (plead, demand, threaten).The game sports a variety of other features, to keep the gameplay interesting, including :  Tech tree (progress cloud),  Emergent events (multiple choices, choices can vary, results influenced by the conditions/charactersitics of your city/mayor),  City/district planning (location, zoning, infrastructure, etc),  Municipal service implementation (police, church, clinic, school, etc), Large scale works (ie railway, port, university, etc),  Economic planning (taxes, service funding, economic edicts, employment),  Governance (state laws, and edicts),  Citizen welfare (social life, health, education, fun etc),  Mayoral elections (start in 3rd era, a loss results in end Progress narrative told through events, newspaper clippings, tech etc.Plenty to do in the game, but little prompting to do it. If you are averse to being proactive (in a gameplay sense) or deducing the ""why"" behind a given in game result, then UE will quickly become frustrating for you. The game treads a fine line between deliberately obfuscating mechanics for the sake of immersion/depth, and not providing enough feedback on mechanics that really should be made available.  IMO it does not always get this mix right. Some of this is by design, but some is merely a lack of polish and will hopefully be corrected in time.In short, a different take on an established genre (ie city buidling/governance), engaging for those that appreciate depth. Let down by late game performance issues, at times a lack of feedback, and noticeable incidences of primarily polish type bugs (missing tooltips, etc). For me it is refreshingly novel, both engaging and fun, if at times a little frustrating/perplexing. I recommend it. "

												Great politics + city-builder simulation game. It has everything I have ever wanted in a city-building game. For me it is quite entertaining and capitivating; although some people may not be interested in managing a city's taxes and electrical grid while trying to balance a budget, to me it is very fun.There are a few bugs and some inconsistency with regards to tooltips, but I'm sure they will get patched away quickly. All in all, great game and I look forward to seeing it grow and develop, and for my city to grow and develop!			"

												If the game was priced at 20-25$ i would recomend it. At its current state its little more than a threatening simulator. The politics are boring and when it comes time to afford somthing just raise taxes and threaten everyone. The game is too basic for the price.Here is a simple pro/con PROSNo game like it out thereInteresting gameplay ""for a short time""ConsLag after 5-8 districtsGets repetitive even after 2 1/2 Hrs.Costs and taxes are way to basic and the costs for certain buildings are way overboard.All in all wait for a sale or for the devs to lower the price.

It is a strategical game.

												As a fan of simulations and grand strategy I am loving this game. But beware it is a rough diamond. There are a number of bugs, I personally haven't encoutered any game breaking bugs. My computer is close to the minimum requirements and am running the game on lowest graphic settings smoothly. This means that for me the game isn't very pretty, but for me that is not a problem. The game itself is a new breed of strategy games, much more akin to the Democracy series or Fate of the World, than Civilization franchise or Europa Universalis. There is no combat and during a game you can control one city (others are just diplomatic or trading partners). You can't compare the game to the old school Sierra games Caesar, Pharaoh etc. either as you have only indirect control over industries and commerce. The game is from a small Finnish dev team and I'm Finnish, so I am a bit biased. The game is expensive, but I think it is worth my money. Plus I liked the idea of supporting a small Finnish company.There are scenarios and a grand campaign. The campaign is essentially a freeplay, sandbox game where you begin building a city from a scratch and then have a few ways to finish the game through victory or you can go for the test of time victory condition where you essentially just have to hang on to the power from 1820 to 2020. You can lose votes, but never a mayoral election, that is a gameover situation. In scenarios you start with a ready made city facing a situation  with which you have to cope and there is a clearly defined end-goal.The game itself consists of keeping the citizens happy or at least happy enough and improving the quality of life. In game this is represented by Wheel of Life values, that add up to the general happiness of the population. The happiness of the people affect their the industrial and commercial life of the city, meaning companies and citizens will have more income which you can tax, giving more income to the city. Happiness comes from services the city provides but also form the private sector. If you want to change the city in some way, add services, raise taxes or issue work safety laws you have to go through a democratic voting process. Now the votes. Some people are finding this game shallow, claiming it to be a clickfest. I disagree. I do agree that there aren't very many things the player can do, at least not in a game-mechanic-point-of-view. You can make proposals and parties can make proposals. Then you can try to influence the parties of your view so the vote goes in your favour, majority wins the vote. There is the soft approach Plead, firm approach Demand and the aggressive Threat. Later you also unlock spying which opens up a possibility to use dirt. As a mayor you have a goodwill Value, which is based on events and past incidents in the city, this is the resource that tells how effectively or poorly your threats, pleads and demands go through. There is also a mayoral resource Prestige, which allows you to overturn votes, speed up voting etc. I understand that many frustrated players are just pushing their votes through and thinking that it is a clickfest.I personally am playing the game spending lots of time planning and strategising, looking at my options before starting actual votes, so when I do start a vote, I can tell that it will be easy and effortless to win, without clicking new appeals every month. The other reason for this is that I don't to in a disadvantage if another party makes a proposal I hate. There is a political compass to follow which shows which parties would support or oppose your proposals and by how much. To me this is the best part of the game. At times it is just about waiting to execute a plan at a better time. For me this games political and city-planning elements are definitely what I've been looking for in a game. If you're hesitant there are a number of good let's plays out there, showing off game play and explaining the game mechanics. I'd recommend them very warmly as playing only two hours (for refund reasons) will give, but a small glimpse of the game and maybe not enough to make an informed decision. If you read all the reviews there are many who regret not refunding in time.			"

												Urban Empire is a city-building political strategy game.   This is not your typical city builder.  The main difference between Urban Empire and more traditional city builders is that most everything is put to a vote, so politics and relationships with parties matter. Districts are placed with zoning layouts, services, and infrastructure support. The city council must approve new districts through a vote.  They also will vote on tax rate changes, modifications to existing districts, edicts, and service funding levels. You take control of a mayoral family dynasty and you are required to lead your city and people through 200 years of history (5 eras).  A large variety of events will make each game slightly different. Regarding gameplay, you have to establish infrastructure, plan city districts, debate political decisions at the town council, bribe or blackmail your opponents, empower the democratic rights of your people or ignore them and reign unilaterally. A research tree contains inventions that unlock new services and edicts. Citizens have needs, such as social life, environment, health, and fun. In Urban Empire, you are not only facing problem after problem on how to develop your city, but also how to rule and manage it. There’s big political game behind running of the city, you have to solve the problem and plan what you going to do to run the city effectively through the city council.However, for my taste, the game is too dry.   Determine citizen needs and figure out how to pass it though the city's political power brokers.   I would have liked to interface more with the city, its citizens, and the leaders of the political parties.It's a BIg Chewy - 6.5/10			"

												Ok please bare with me i will update this later but just a little review for thoose pondering wether to buy, so far i am only on ear 1 - this reveiw will change.So Far so good, its fun if not a little on the repetitive side! This might just be the way i have choose to play as im not really to bothered about the votes. Most of them seem to go my way without me really trying, watching the city grow is nice and the modifying of districts to help them evolve is super cool. its a slow paced game and if you try to speed it up manally you end up in all sorts of trouble.except for the odd dilema and the reasearch the game kinda slowly pushes you forward there isnt much to do it but make some choices sit around waiting for income to come in, make some more choices. overall, a well made interesting concept, if you like city builders i would recomend this,  i think at the moment its just a tad repetitve  and easy, i seem like im cluelessy playing and doing pretty well for someone just 'giving it a test run'.

												Terrible game thusfar.  Played 3 hours and like others have mentioned, it gets quite boring very quickly.  The most activity I had was speeding up the game, then pausing to pass votes.  The tutorial during the first campaign offers limited help.  You really can't customize your districts because the add ons cost too much and have too much upkeep.  Can't add new zones for the same reason.  Random events and votes just stop time while you sit and watch the city do much of nothing.  The innovation cloud thing is pointless when you can't really implement the unlocked features.  Got water and gas, but can't install because of the upkeep.  Can't make people happy because I can't upgrade services.Tried to get a refund and was denied.  Thought this was going to be a better game, but I was sorely disappointed.  Only saving grace for my disappointment was saving 15% on pre-order.			"

												First let me say the idea of a Mayor sim is a great idea. Problem is that the game plays less like a sim and more like a story board that your stuck following. Still not a bad attempt and I still find the story interesting. Sadly there are bugs. The map one that seems to affect alot of people. I got one where I had a pop up that wouldnt go away. Ended up alting out without being able to save my game. Other problem is its performance later in the game. At the beginning you can spam build your city and grow the whole area of the map a couple years. In all the gameplay videos it showed more a thought process. This isnt true. Spam away and 2-3 years city is as large as yo ucan make it. Sadly around 1860 the map starts to freeze up and lag. At 1900 it stutters enough its distracting. I have a super computer....around 32 gigs of ram ...and nothing ever lags. So its the game not me.			"

												This wasn't really what I expected. I don't blame the game for that at all. I wanted a more intricate mechanic based around complex relationships with the city council and citizens that reflectedin votes and decisions. This game isn't that and again that's not the game's fault. The concepts in the game are amazing and will probably carry the game for awhile, but after I played for a few hours I wasn't having any fun and didn't feel connected to anything in the game.The economy was probably the biggest turnoff for me as it is spiradic at best. It appears that the only viable way to offset costs is to constantly raise taxes. I've been a part of city government for many years and it simply doesn't work this way. Several things, including state and federal funding, for infrastructure and services have been left out. The early eras are understandable in this regard however. Though adding sewage to my districts shouldn't cost me 50k per month for 2,000 people. Wtf are they eating that requires that kind of cost for sewage?!All in all I'm sure this will be an awesome game for alot of people, but it just wasn't there for me. I wish there was a ""meh"" recommendation on Steam. Maybe Paradox will take a stab at something in this ballpark eventually. Ended up refunding.			"

												I bought this thinking it was a city building game, and there hasn't been many good ones for a long time. However this game is not really a city building game]/b]. Rather it is a city management game.So in city building games you have money, build house (plots), production builds, security, etc and collect taxes and trade to make money back. This game is definitely not that.In current city management games (like Cities Skylines or Sim City) you have money, place zones and the game simulates citizens filling those plots, which you then collect taxes from. This income is then used to pay for services. These often have more tax options and possibly zoning options but it is still very much what you do. This game isn't that.In this game it tries to portray eal city management. You can't just place plots or build structures, there is a city council that has to weigh the benefits of an option. If you want to expand the city, you need to design a zone, then propose that to the city council. A political party or more may oppose this, but you can appeal to them. However if you have bad finances don't expect the vote to pass. Almost every action goes to a vote.The game is set in a pseudo-realistic time, and as time passes new technologies are invented (game explains that technologies that you unlock are from you importing them to the city). The newspaper that pops up includes references to things that happened in that year in the real world.This is a slow game, and you end up having to struggle to balance the budget. The politics can also get quite intriguing. So be prepared, if you don't like slow games with lots of reading then stay away.The game itself runs fine for me, no issues there. "

												I'm a huge fan of the Tropico series, by Kalypso, so naturally I was excited to see this title coming out.  I pre-ordered it, and almost right away I could tell this was not the game for me.Basically, all they had to do was give us a more polished version of Tropico, with a more in-depth political model.  They attempted to kind of do that, but then changed the building process (and ease of).  For instance, in order to even build your city, you basically have to build ""wards"" and plan out their outlines.  And interesting concept, but totally un-needed and annoying.  Then the game is basically goes into auto mode, building it's own houses and such, where it wants to ... which totally disrupts your plan for city buildings such as police stations, schools, etc.On top of that, after you place a ""ward,"" it's then broken into different zones, residential, industrial, etc.  From what I can tell, it just randomly assigns these zones, depending on the terrain.  Again, totally annoying and screws up the building process.   30 minutes in, and I still can't figure out how to place the Train Station.  It really shouldn't be this difficult or clumsy.Tutorial is a joke.Luckily I a got a refund.So TLDR:Clumsy, complicated building and planningControl taken out of players hands/ distributed by random assignmentPolitics not really engaging  All we needed was a polished and engaging build-off from Tropico ... but they threw the best parts of Tropico outMusic and sound, meh.

												0/10 <-- Hopefully I can change this after they patch the game, but lazy QA testing has become modern PC game cancer so this is my rating as of now.  I'd like to actually give a review mostly talking about the gameplay, but as it stands I can't really play the game (unless I want to put up with a headache inducing resolution, and frame rate) since I have a modern computer, and I guess the game simply doesn't function correctly on them even with the work around which just kinda sorta fixes the issue.  Aside from the  idiocy of creating a game that forces you to run it with an older OS (which it still runs poorly on), I'd think anyone could see that the game underwent almost no OA testing at all, and this is likely due to the fact that they wanted to get the game out by the 20th so it would go along with innaguration day.  If they wanted to simulate poltics then I guess they did that by having a massive scandal.  They need to fix this issue very quickly, or it's likely that they'll end up being in quite a few ""worst games of 2017"" videos by the end of this year.			"

												Reading through some of these reviews, and some of them are pretty heavy handed.  So instead of pros and cons, praises and complaints, expectations vs. realities.  I'll just give you what it is. Macro Manager:  There are very few things that you actually place aside from the district layout and select services. Political Player:  Work your way around 3+ political parties who vote on every single decision that you make that requires funds or increasing taxes.  But use your political favors wisely, as eventually you will have to run for reelection. Popular Populist:  Meet the needs of your people through six avenues all of which add up to their overall happiness.  Techological Leader:  Work your way through an expansive tech web that starts with advancements from the 1800's all the way to modern times.  Each tech gives you expansive capabilites and services that you can improve your town with.  Financial Guru:  This is the most important.  Without profitable revenue, you will go no where.  Which is really easy to do.All these requires a balance to get you through the game.  Some need a lot of attention, while others will sneak on you at the worst possible moment.  My biggest piece of advice is to restart as soon as you get a grasp of the mechanics of the game.  The tutorial goes too slow, and your district building should be rapid in the early game.  Overall, I recommend this game to those who are curious about the macro style mechanics of the game and do not mind throwing a few extra bucks at a developer who tried to do something new and interesting.

												This is a strange one.A mix of almost impenetrable mechanics, terrible UI, beautiful graphics, incredible atmosphere, intriguing plot, and strangely addictive gameplay.It is not for the faint-hearted and took me over a week to start to understand how the deep game mechanics even work. That said, it is a really fascinating game, and one in which i became oddly invested in. There's something really satisfying about seeing your city grow and prosper, whilst you slowly introduce more and more technology and social changes.As I said, a very atmospheric simulation, which I have spent over 41 hours on since release.BUT....do not buy this game expecting it to be anything like a normal city builder - it is certainly not that.Also, do not expect to understand the mechanics without reference to youtube videos. they are obscure to say the least. This issue is made much worse by the worst UI choices I have ever seen....improving profitability is expressed by a Negative number, highlighted by a red text box! Red=good in this game apparently. But, if you can stomach these issues, the game is really satisfying, and overall, worth the purchase, if only to experience a whole new Genre of game.			"

												Just a couple hours in, but I like it for the most part. The dynamics of managing parties and getting the city council to vote are quite well done. Placing districts, doing research, voting, etc., all make sense and are easy to get used to. Overall I'd say this game is Tropico meets Civ 6 or SimCity city planning. However, I didn't figure out how to modify existing districts or how to add dervices to districts already populated. Maybe I am missing something here, but why can't I repurpose land and put a school where a house used to be? Also, after reserching tech, how can a district be upgraded to have gas lighting or a swer system? I'm sure these things must be available, but the tutorial mode didn't point them out and I couldn't figure it out on my own.The one thing I found very annoying was the inability to save my game. Clicking on ""save"" just prompted the script saying ""Saving is not permitted at this time"" or something like that. Not sure if the game needs an update to ""save game"" or if games that have progressed beyonf era 2 can be saved or something???			"

I thought it would be a sort of simple combination of both genres until I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by the council votes and insufficient funds to run any services. The money part is kinda like cities skylines though.Lots of issues and questions:1. I changed the resolution, the game exits full screen mode and never come back. As a result, I can't click on the bottom buttons like creat new district. I have to restart the game.2. Some icons have a tag or explanation when I move the mouse cursor on it, but other don't. 3. I need to know why a 5% increase in ""expenditure"" would show up in green instead of red.4. What does ""sales demand"" mean? I know what is sales and what is demand, but what it means when you phrase it as ""increase 5% sales demand on xxxx""? 5. Is there a local need over general need even put aside the influence of traffic? I have positive demand for shops, so I changed the percentage of shops in one or more districts. Shops appear, the demand doesn't go down; then the shops bankrupt. Even though some survived, there are still more availble space for ALL of residential, commercial and industrial needs but nothing more show up.6. The font size is too smal. I don't want to read the stories after 2 hours of playing. And that's why I tried to change the resolution to see if it makes the letters look bigger. Of course it fails			"

												Really loved the depth in this game ; lots of choice and a lot of political realism ; what I would love to see for an expansion would be more scenarios such as the WWI period and the revolutions that followed.  Maybe stuff in response to the Great Depression and World War Two.  Also I take it the early game is based on the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Historically the Austrian Social Democrats were Marxists until they were crushed by fascism.  BTW I'm only up to the 1920s so far - so I don't know what comes after.  Sometimes I think I'd rather a scenario based on leading a Party rather than a single Mayor ; But who am I to complain?  This game fixes lots of the problems I once associated with the Genre.  A progressive welfare state is viable without ideological assumptions in the scripting which rule out social democratic strategies.  I really hope expansions and mods follow this ; Its really good so far - but I'm sure it could be better.  One last thing that annoyed me:  I hung on as Mayor in the 1920s but I can't seem to shake the right-wing parties ; I'm still getting good legislation through ; But it would be nice to have strategies capable of turning the tide in favor of the left-wing parties...  BTW the Communists also often play a spoiling role early on - which is not historical...  The self-proclaimed Communists parties arose in response to the split in European social democracy on account of World War One....			"

Those who make this complaint, they are clearly forgetting this is a Kalypso game, you know the Tropico game developers. I thought this was actually a lot more interesting than many games in simular genres. + Easy to learn the rules of the game+ Innovative take on an old genre+ The Tropico Easter-Eggs/References+ Potential to become far greater with the DLC that Kalypso is imfamous for.- A little too simple for City Builder Pros- Kalypos, overstating the games nature- The Families are not that different- Political Parties Don't matter as long as you balace the budget-If you don't balance the budget, the political parties will stonewall you on everything.

												I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. There was a gap in the sim/strategy market for a balanced political-economic-rts and I think they have really plugged into that gap. That being said, there are a few issues that leave the game needing some polish. I have only had one critical issue which was having the game progressively slow until I had to turn it off and re-open it - haven't had it since. Other than that it's little things here and there: things spelt wrong, descriptions vague and unnecessary, not being able to micromanage the distribution of a district, some things are in the tutorial but critical success points aren't, etc. None of these have taken away from the base simulation which I can say is a lot of fun to play with. Definitely recommend for the genre fanatics (like myself), but wait for a sale otherwise.			"

												Most positive reviews I've read share similar views to myself; it's enjoyable but needs some polish.There are a lot of negative reviews that criticise the devs choices on mechanics; whilst all aren't exactly as I like them these were pretty darn clear before purchase and I think some people weren't expecting a dev to have opted for a defined stream of choices (so many let you do that for yourself or at least give you an option between the two models). Overall, I actually like what the dev has gone for and there is a robustness to the path, plus I had bothered to read and knew that wasn't a feature offered (I don't think it's reasonable for the devs to have been expected to say ""we aren't doing XYZ"", that's ludicrous and some people need to grow up and face reality).There is nothing game breaking wrong with the game and all bugs I’ve faced are minor. In this day and age this is laudable; especially as unlike most niche games they didn't go down the god-awful route of early-access abuse (in some cases it can be useful, but I have too many games I've given up on and a good while later they still haven't been 'released').The strategy is light but with a subtle complexity (political consequences for example only really affect the short to medium term). It's fun and light without being too easy. As I found out today, some challenges cannot be overcome in terms of your design choices if you truly make a mess at the beginning - just because it works for Era II doesn't mean it won't destroy you in Era III / IV. I actually expected there to be little replay value during my first couple of hours of play, though this changed after I got booted out at election time and realised it had got more engrossing and I could plan for this particular challenge differently. That's a good thing - losing actually made me want to try to do it differently and have another go!Oh, and for those whining about it being 'slow' or little to do (I suspect this is earlier on, but as your edicts increase and need to balance more parties and tweak a dozen or more districts this changes), 4X speed is your friend.The only real downside for me is the price - £35 is the wrong price point. It's £25 on Amazon and that is a much more appropriate price point from a value perspective. I appreciate that niche games sell less and thusly they have a harder job of finding the right price to give the necessary profit overall, but I suspect some of the whinging would have been reduced if the pricing was right. Plus – they make less from a retail sale as a % of sale price, which in itself is lower, so why on earth have a Steam price so high. Let’s assume steam is similar to Apple et al and give the dev/publisher 70% - that would still be considerably higher than what they get from a retail sale and they would sell more at the higher % on Steam if they priced accordingly – remember, they sell to a distributor who sells to the retailer (who sells at only 71% of the Steam price on Day 1); plus the delivery costs included at all of those stages – so let’s assume the dev/publisher gets at best 40% of their Steam sale price for each retail sale (I think that’s high). It always baffles me why they don’t price more wisely on Steam, get more sales there, and therefore more cash overall whilst at the same time keeping the gamer happy. Sorry, rant over.			"

												They should never release a game with this many bugs.  Thumbs down for that alone...The spinning screen is simply unbearable making the game completely unplayable.  The ""disconnect all peripherals"" recommendation for getting it the spinning to stop is ridiculous.If the game becomes playable, I will re-rate it.  If the bugs preventing the game from running are not fixed with the first update (better be w/in 10 days), I will ask for a refund.			"

												Not what I expected at all. I expected a more immersive experiance. The tropes of histoic politics are ingrained in each city from the start. So if you want to make democratic moves of the 21st century you better be prepared to fail hard. The game is not a builder at all, its more of a political childrens game. I even pre purchased the game, not impressed with the graphics at all.			"

												A great game but there is still a lot of bug issues, i know it was just released but here are some of my issues: The scientific victory wont work even though i maxed out all my techs and even got the steam achievemnt for it, also in economic victory i think it was, said upgrade 3 districts and have them with all infanstructures, i have about 12 of those maxed out districs with high densisty and all elcetronics, telephone line infanstructures, road, waste management all of it, i also have encountered a big bug when you are being voted mayor the meter if it is positive you will lose the mayoral campaign, if its negative you will win it, its a wierd glitch have no idea why it does that, as well as political partys pisted at you near age V of campaign and nomatter what you do to make city happy, i even tried not to do any politcal movement on them, no pleading, no threatning, no demanding as well as blackmail which anytime i got it i gave it to them so they can discard it and i get my points but after a while this stops and the politics refuse to listen to you. Another problem with them game is also Era III, by time you get their things get rlly rlly hard and i think it needs to easen up on you, especially the tutorial sucked and didnt explain anything cep how to move a camera and raise taxed and make a district, great ideas but waht about tutorial on district management? the demands and stuff. Also i encountered another bug for the diplomatic, i have my average happiness at about 9 but the achievement for it wont unlock so i get politcal victory, i only won b/c of a timed victory. Now either i have to wait til 2100 or something but it says i need 5 enviromental and 5 bussiness laws to be passed, ive waited over 20 years, not one showed up either glitched out or are these only a specific time you get these 2? if so how did i get civil rights and childrens moments 20 years prior? is there a limit? anywho great game a lot of potential pls developers if ur reading this pls fix these bugs im not targeting u im just trying to point out a few bugs that interupt the game and how it is a bit difficicult to play on other factions, epecially  worker class one, thats a rlly big pain			"

												Seems like kalypso pushed this out of early access too soon. Would post neutral if possible. Rating positive because the game has some merits and it has enough negative reviews already. Pros:-Story/flavour is quite good-Sound is good-All around generally enjoyable for the first 10 hours or soCons:-Missing tool tips -Lack of transparency in terms of game mechanics-Performance issues for LOTS of people that have a decent size city-Tedious city council (you need to watch the votes being tallied for around 10s every time you do something with no way to skip the animation, gets very old when you need to watch this 200+ times in a play through)-Can cheese the tech system (internet etc in 1860s), possible to complete the entire tech tree before the outbreak in WWI-No real downside for adopting rapid change in your society, there is a mechanic where people will need more amenities to be happy years later but these needs increase over time regardless. Resisting change will only make your city a backwater, unable to provide more amenities when they want them later on.-Political party ideologies are not represented properly and rarely change with the simplistic political compass. Eg the communists will support things lower taxes on the wealthy and are pro church because authoritarianism and conservatism are not separated. For the same reason why fascists will oppose things like youth sport, promoting national culture etc because they classed as socialist (national socialists aren't socialist?) and/or liberal policies. Good concept, bad execution/possibly unfinished.			"

												This is not a city-building game, this is a ""ask for permission everytime you want to build something"". Boring voting scheme that doesnt let you manage anything and see the political aspects and consequences  of your decisions! Do not buy!This is a waste of money!

												Ok so this game has terrible reviews. But think about it. Its on its first version EVER. Think about your favorite game ever but on its first stage. The game is laggy and won't let me build a district and makes you go through the tutorial twice. But think about in a year! It won't be so laggy, there will be far less bugs, and way more content. For now I think this is trash but maybe in a year or even a month, it will be much better so just give it a chance.			"

												First of all - this game SHOULDN'T be compared to city builder games because it has a completely different approach to the city management with more emphasis on the family, politics and different era characteristics. You actually kind of macro-manage districts with not much room to manipulate like you are able to in typical city builder games. The game leads you through some of the most interesting eras of modern history, with all the global crisis affecting your little city as well. You develop technologies to boost your industry and commerce, propose edicts to balance out some of the issues you might have in your city, you make taxing changes etc. In my opinion, it all feels moderately complex although it has quite a lot features.Now the biggest problem that I personally have with the game is the transparency. After a couple of play-throughs I still have no idea why some of the issues appear in this game and I cannot pinpoint the source of the problem in order to find a way to resolve it. I feel like the game is missing more clear UI, explanation of the various stats that your companies have that affect their success, and so on. There should be a lot better advisor system in my opinion.Overall - the game is fun and it has a kind of a fresh approach to the city game genre. It does make you play it a couple of times which I tend to value the most in games. However it does not justify the price. It should be priced at about 20$ at most because it lacks the complexity to be valued more. 6.5/10			"

												After watching a few youtube videos about the game, I pre-ordered the game...I have to admit that the tutorials in the game seem broken to me. I find it very easy to break the tutorial steps by clicking on other options within the game.. I 'm current on my third game, which has the tutorial disabled, as the tutorial was asking me to do something, but couldn't figure out what or where i could modify settings and/or adjust rci ratios...  I would click on something other then the tutorial steps and break the progress. Luckily I've watched to preview videos and started a third game with tutorials disabled and I'm enjoying the game. My only issue so far is the tutorial for new users, until they fix them, I suggest watching quill18's videos

 I would recommend this game for business/management type tycoon type of players. I love tycoon games, and this is a neat idea and execution of a tycoon game where you don't have direct access to micromanagement a city, but take more of a political view of the game. I love the idea, and so far so good on execution.			"

												5 Hours to Boredom, that's how long it took me to ""shelve"" this game.........No muliplayer...in this day of age?  No interactive elections in a game like this? You can't modify family names from the weird given names?  Is there more to this game?  Only 3 senarios, 1 campaign and no sandbox?  Only 4 families and no ability to modify attributes at all? Slow to load (I7 and 650M card, 32gb) and clunky between screens, less than average graphics, and the font size is so small you can barely see it.  I know there's a fun game in there somewhere?  I'm still working on finding it!  But, this game has some real problems.  The playing of the game starts out interesting up until you figure out just how repetitious it is.  Voting is the high point of the game, and as soon as that gets boring, it's all down hill from there.  I love the subject matter, and I just had to have it.  I hope the modder community will give this game some real time....because it could be a great game, but now, in its current state, it's an, ""okay"" game.   Am I going to have to wait 2 years for an Urban Empire 2?  Or, buy countless DLC's to finally have the polished game this could be?  NOT worth the price I paid over 30 bucks even with the pre-release special....I would wait until the price drops, because it will...  It's not worth a negative rating, just a bland so/so, ""hope it gets modded and added to""  so, it's a 5/10 rating for me.			"

												Some people are saying the game is shallow, but the politics only feels easy early. The longer the game goes on, the more interests your trying to balance (including your own). And just because the parties will support you doesn't mean that decision is right. I buried my first campaign when my economy began to slide and all parties (regardless of their hate of taxes) supported raising them month over month to save the budget... Which of course led to bleeding my people and businesses dry. Every tax I raised led to LESS money in my coffers. You can't always trust the politicians, and you have to be intentional and sometimes fight the council with all you have for the good of the city.This is exactly what I wanted to play.			"

												Over-all this game largely met the kind of expectations I had for it. It set out to be a game based around being a dynasty of politically important figures in a city. It gives you benefits for focusing on various aspects, and you usually are restricted in just how much you can do with your city. While it's possible to obtain a strong enough enough economy to achieve multiple goals it seems nigh impossible to do all of them.This game has a dash of Sim City, Democracy, and even a few key elements of it's own. It's not an amazing game, but it does seem like an entertaining game even if it has a hard time showing exactly how certain aspects impact your city.			"

												Not quite House of Cards, but a pretty good game regardelss; but could use some polishing and unique DLC (i.e., adding new families/political parties, enhancing the political features, etc.). A must buy if you enjoy management/city builders (although this isn't quite a builder), and most definitely satiates the political void that is lacking in other similar-style games. Love the easter eggs from Tropico and others. 10/10 will enjoy simulating Trumpenreich.			"

												What I like about this game is that it adds more of a realistic feel to it than other games for example SimCity. In this you have to fight for what you believe for witht he city coucil. Its not supposed to be a you say it goes type of game and I like that, it brings a new combination of city bulider, simulation and stratgey. A mix that we don't see much of in the gaming world. We grew tired of seeing SimCity after Simcity, F1 after F1 (simualtion- kinda) and all of the tycoons. This adds a new mix to entice us. The Devs knew what the gamers wanted. Especially in this field of games, you always see Black Ops and Battlefield in other fields, this is exactly what we wanted in the stratgey/ city bulider field. The game is unpredictable and I like. For example I play through era 2 and I create 5 new districts with all the support I needed. I play through it again and I have to ask the empire for money. Great game totally worth $40, no doubt. Amazing game Devs. LOVE it.			"

												In the mere 12 hours that I've owned this game, it has crashed 4 times, 3 of those crashing the whole PC, one to blue-screen.  That would be a pretty severe indictment of an early alpha release, and terrible for a beta version, but Urban Empires is supposedly a full release, ready for prime time.  There's no way on earth I could recommend this software while it is so unstable as to crash a well-specced Win 10 PC so continually even if it were a free game, so I certainly encourage everyone to resist actually paying to have their PC crash, data lost, etc.If the game interests you, as it obviously did me, then I strongly urge that you wait for a more stable and fixed version.

有更好阅读体验的图文版链接[cowlevel.net]Urban Empire：食之无味，弃之可惜。我们在梦想与进步中长大。1820年，皇帝赐了你一块地，给了你500k的个人起始资金和1000k的城市资金，作为城市的创建者，从下手划分第一块行政区起，你将要开始你的市长生涯。而这个城市的名字，你把它叫做“Kaisershafen”（要是你没改名的话）。在最开始的阶段，只能建造一个低密度、仅有最基本的基础设施，甚至连分区比例都无法自定义的行政区，开始走向小城崛起的道路。Kaisershafen的繁荣发展与别处是不同的，他麻雀虽小，但确人才济济——什么热力学、流行病学、炸药、电子游戏等等，都将在这里被发明。不要怀疑，是虽然表面上是发展云，但是研究完成一个之后会让你选择下一个“发明”，想来诺贝尔、开尔文这样的人物都蜗居在这个小城，这样一个小地方何愁不兴旺发达。甚至将来自己发射个卫星，也不是不可以。更难能可贵的是，这里还是人权斗士的运动基地，什么劳动法、女权、环保、动保，在这里都可以看到他们活动的身影，性爱革命、消除歧视这样的运动也是说“发明”就“发明”，端的是“世界何其大，发展靠我家”。虽然Kaisershafen在地球上占据了这么一个举足轻重的位置，但是也不固步自封，世界之大，我市伸出友谊之手，堪堪选出了6个未来入得了法眼的城市：牛津、旧金山、悉尼、圣彼得堡、上海、仙台，虽不是首都，但也横跨世界五大洲，哦不少了个非洲。但先不急，先把眼下这个小镇子经营好吧。钱，钱，钱！城市发展之本，便是资金了，如何让运营城市的成本低于带来的收益，便是发展首要的问题。每建立一个行政区，都需要额外的成本，而人口的增长和行政区数量的关系尚不明确，所以要慎重创建新的行政区，在有需求的时候再建岂不稳妥得多。发展的步子也不能迈的太大，不能将无法承担的基建一股脑儿的往城区上般，而要走一步看一步，先找个试验田看看带来的收益能不能值回成本，再考虑是否将这个推广。这本是一个城市发展的应有方式，然而UE内部经济循环的不明确导致就算成本一时没有把握，城市入不敷出眼看走向崩溃，依然可以靠不断提高税率来弥补漏洞，而此时本是用来制衡市长行为的议会，居然也会用脚投票，只要不结余太多的提税提案，通通通过。也尝试过降低税率来观察是否能通过刺激消费带来收入的提升，但结果是虽然有略微的提升，但是效果远不如直接调节税率来的明显。虽然高税率之下随处可见破产企业，但是城市收入还是稳步提升，人民也过得幸福如意，简直匪夷所思。压榨人民制定高税率，虽然日子当下过得有些紧，但在研究完一项科技、时代更替下，收入能实现稳定的增长，日进斗金不是梦。正所谓“降税容易提税难”，赶早变着法从市民手中抠钱才是硬道理。我最喜欢胁迫他人了既然提到了议会，那就不能不说说这个游戏的议会系统。由于前几个时代皇帝钦定了玩家来做这个市长，完全不怕被弹劾，也不怕有竞争者的出现，本来用来制约玩家用来改变法案支持率的“政治货币”党派好感度，尤其在不能跌破下限-10的情况下，其本身意义也然无存。在好感度为正的情况下，恳求非常有效，一旦跌到负值，那么胁迫反而变成了最容易的途径。议会便犹如一个玩具，任由玩家揉捏。就算是后期出现了竞选也无妨，只要城市发展良好，每两个月去稍微胁迫一下每个党派，市长位置还不是手到擒来。每6年一次的选举，也不过就是消耗我“政治货币”的途径而已，和之前已经不同至于与经济相关联的提案，只要城市日进斗金，财务无忧，不管有什么政治诉求这些党派都会无脑通过。我造的我来毁随着城市的发展，城市密度需要由低向高发展，来容纳更高效率的住房、工厂和商店。然而，在此之前已经建立的建筑物无法自动更新，于是中后期拆迁（需要科技解锁）就变成了一项很常见的工程。虽然看着一座座房屋轰然倒塌是一件很爽快的事情，但是一个区域那么多建筑，一个个点过来确实非常的累。在没有框选和快捷键的条件下，一个个选中建筑，移动到右下角摧毁，在到屏幕中间确认选择，然后一片区域重复几十次，是一件很傻B的事情。虽然拆迁需要付出一定的代价，相应建筑物带来的利润也会随之失去，但是之后新建筑慢慢拔地而起，带来的利益也是明显的，只是太繁琐的操作容易让人失去耐心，所以我都是在区域比例分配那里先全选成住房，确定改变区域后，再全选为工厂，提交改变，用私人资金改后，再手动分配比例，反正改变区域比例不要钱，所以用自己的钱也就不需要提案，区域人员的安置赔偿都不用管，虽然也要动好几下鼠标，比一个个摧毁省力多了。虽然这样就不能解锁拆迁成就了自由，平等，博爱！关于人权的问题，一直以来都是现实生活中争议颇多的地方，在这个游戏中也是。琳琅满目的提案，有些就算放到当前来看也是尚未实现。比如同工同酬、同性婚姻合法化等等。非常的pc，倒是我喜的部分。退化完成最后说说这个游戏其他方面的质量。游戏汉化不易，但是这个汉化的质量确实有点垃圾。比如前文提到的“发展”和“发明”指的是同一个东西；比如“少数名族”的同性恋问题；再比如将LGBT翻译为“同性恋”；再比如本段标题的“退化完成”，而英文原文是“Downsizing done”。而只在科技完成时出现的原本就不多z中文语音中，我竟然还在其中听到了一条英文语音，不过我倒是忘了记下是哪一段。没玩过游戏就翻译，以及缺少统筹校对，是很多已有汉化的通病，这个游戏汉化该有的也都有。游戏本身其他的硬伤也不少：1.流程单一，一个家族就是一个既定的事件，没有重复玩的价值。三张战役地图大同小异，也就是地形稍有区别，反而是三个挑战还有那么点意思。2.优化烂，游戏进行到后期卡的不行，载入及保存时间长，常常未响应让人以为程序崩溃。玩着玩着程序崩了的情况也有发生过。3.内部经济逻辑不清前面已经提及，进入下一个时代只不过就换了个接班人，收入却猛的增加，着实让人捉摸不透。4.成就系统混乱不堪，目前成就各种张冠李戴。5.画面，嗯感受一下高楼大厦吧（？乐观者说，这玻璃杯里有一半是满的。悲观者说，这玻璃杯里有一半是空的。工程师说，这玻璃杯只要有原来的一半大就够了。同样的一句话，送给这个游戏，这游戏内容看似丰富，实则浅尝辄止，壳子只要有现在的一半就够了。当然如果你是乐观者，可以玩一玩。			"

												I think those that wrote negative reviews need to rethink their opinion.You need to sink some serious planning to do well in this game.  When I first played this, there were a number of annoying things mentioned in th emany negative reviews.  Many have been fixed and I dont doubt this game will get better BUT....I just got voted out after my second election but it took 8+ ? hours to get to that point .....You  have to pay attention before putting an edict up for vote,,, there are a number of things going into your success on the vote,,,,not just hammering the plead , demand,  or threat buttons...  these can help you but a lot mor to it than that....I admit when I first played I thought ..ok , not much too this, THEN I read the reviews and was like ""bummer"" BUT I was wrong.and so are many of the reviews,,,,,AND if they put a little effort into it...U.E. has serious potential....

												This game is fantastic.  I will admit, it has a large learning curve.  The creator of this game made an excellent new genre of City Building, Real Time Strategy, and Turn based gaming.  I have been playing city builders since the original Sim City.  This game has all of the fun of those games, with an added element of politics.  You must learn to work with, and destroy, the political parties to get the things you want passed.  This makes it a very realistic game, and fun once you get the hang of it. "

												I actually enjoyed this game---it's a bit different than other city builders I play. I have to think through decisions---build another district? Or repave the existing ones. Then there's the costs. Nothing's free. It's closer to real life than people think (in the real world, I do this kind of planning. It's probably why I still play city players.)I haven't yet experienced any of the bugs, although some of the spellings are odd. A copy editor should have run through the game before release.Other than that, I'm having fun playing.			"

												Good game. An interesting political and economical simulator.+ Reasonably difficult, you can be voted out in eras 3-5 if you're on bad terms with the political parties+ Depicts the history in an interesting way, you can feel the world changing over time+ Keeps you invested in the game, presents the player with challenges even in the late game (for me it was actually the hardest party-wise in the late game)- Hard to understand the reasons behind what is happening at times (e.g. persistent low residential demand, constant influx of lower class citizens). Tooltips like the ones in Victoria 2 would be welcome. Many things may be not evident, like what exactly the tax rate does, I think at least an explanation would be good in such cases.- Some things that you expect would happen, don't. E.g. people moving between the districts or preferring particular ones- Watch your RAM and save frequently on the later stages, the game crashed to desktop for me around year 2010, for some other people too (8GB RAM)All in all, I spent the weekend playing the game and had good fun, in my opinion that makes the game deserve a good recommendation despite some issues which may or may not be resolved later.

												I strongly disagree with most of the bad reviews on this page. I am in no way supporting the game just because I spent money on it. I usually play grand strategy games such as Crusader kings and etc. and also great city building games like cities: Skylines. This is a totally different type of game. It is not action packed in anyway. It is cool that you indirectly lead a city. Your family is a mayor and you can control districts, edicts, and government buildings and it is tough because there are polital parties that have different views and always vote on everything in the city. You work through the eras like this and trying to balance a city and personal budget. It is much slower paced and a different take on city building and management. Please take these into consideration.			"

												There's just something about this that feels.....shallow.  I like the idea that you're basically playing as a mayor of a town and are limited by what the legislature says (aka what happens in most towns in western societies with a mayor and council governing system)....but.....something is off.For one, the UI system is a bit crowded and overwhelming.  It's in sad need of being overhauled.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not trashing it because it's complex.  Complex is good if it's organized (aka Europa Universalis IV) but this is just a mess.Maybe this can be fixed in patches?  Then again, maybe not.  For now, what a shame.  This could have been something new and fun.			"

												Its a fun game.  They mixed the ideas of a city builder and politics together very well.  It does take a little bit of play troughs to fiqure out how to make money, and find out how to little quirks work togother.With that said there are some inprovments needed in the game, (what game doesnt).  Performace in the late game is can be improved. I do lag once I hit the Era 4 and have 30k plus in the city.  And better tooltips would be nice.  But there is no major issue that would prevent me from playing the game.I didnt have huge expectations because I never heard of Reborn, but Kalypos does push desent games, so the Urban Emprie did surpise me to be better then I thought.  I am really interested to see what dlcs and hopefully what expansion can add and improve into the game.			"

												this game like 80 percent of what i really want it too bewould recomend the game it is quite eazy tho wish you could lay out the districts better  like  i spent forever tying too get my streets to line up right and never really did so much wasted spacei like letting the coumnity desgin the districts tho no need for me too do that   i just wish instead of sliders i could select witch blocks are industal comercial residentaland yes tooltips i get the jest off it but for the hc players we like too know everything my biggest problem with the game is its hard too influnce your town too think a certian way like all the civil right bs we evently get passed u may be able too stop 1 or 2 kry laws all the time but after era 3 u have too keep goodwill up too stay in office  as a mayor you should be able to aling urself with a prty and influanse your town to think a certain way to a point  i wanna make a  commie town and i cannot its impossible u can slow the progress but u can never change the outcome  the biggest reason i guess is cause we have no ideai how our population votesi know i said alot of negitives  but  i say them cause i despertly want this game too fillout a lil moreall in all 20 dollar game atm with some good patches too put this game as one of the best if they just listen too there gamers "

												Lots of bugs currently but even so the game is playable but overall has very limited play.There is a learning curve to figure out the politics that the tutorial doesn't explain very well at all.I have had no crashes. But did get a pop-up with no mulitple choice options (normally they all do) which basicly ruined the game because there was nothing to do to get rip of it. Like so.

So once you have your whole land filled with districts (which is very easy to do) and have complete coverage for service buildings, there is not much do but research, and do upgrades of the buildings, and vote. At that point you end playing the game at max fast forward speed.I wouldn't say it is boring for the game type it is. I just expect to do more.The game will be playable once the bugs are fixed. But how long will you play is the question. I will be playing more to try to get a the last era without a game killing bug but it might be ewasier to wait for a patch. "

												This game while entertaining I believe forces a political agenda down your throat expecially when it comes to the progression of your city and its society. I would rather play tropico or cities skylines, I would even rather play simcity 5 than play this again. Things such as LGBT rights and womens rights should STAY OUT of videogames. Videogames should NOT be used as a political stage to push certain agendas. I mean would you put Black Lives Matter into a game? Would you put extreme religion into a game? No. Im sorry but I did one play through, got up to era 5 and I said forget playing another run.I am extremely disapointed in this game.			"

												Great Game, I have already logged 5.5 hours and I can tell you that it is exactly what I expected it to be. It IS NOT a city builder, it IS NOT a political simulation, IT IS a simplified simulation game where you are a mayor, make rules, set standards, place structures and WATCH your empire evolve. I recommend this game to all the hard core fans of Tropico that would have liked to have more political input and law making abilities; and less city building/managing and more city evolution watching. It's honestly a good game for the price, some changes I recommend after my first play through.PLEASE FIX OR ADD:- Allow districts to be named longer, I wanted to use Pioneer District and realized it was cut off around ""Pioneer Dis"", I'm sure allowing longer names is an easy fix. I felt like I had to overthink naming and find one that fit.- While modifying districts, modifying taxes, modifying services... there should DESPERATELY be a function that allows me to go back a page/tab. For example, I open up modify district, I confirm the zoning, then the second menu pops up and asked me to confirm the services... there should be an option that allows me to go back to zoning and re-edit. Maybe like a back arrow in the top left. This would be extremely useful because sometimes I find myself going in and out and re-doing the modify district settings until my proposition pleases the council.- Some things are way to overpriced, like lamps. I would propose you do a full re-vamp of the prices in-game.- I would like simple road contruction. That way I can place my districts anywhere in the map and connect them via road. That way I can have them distanced by each other, and just like reality... each district should be ran by a different set of rules and you should be able to propose eddicts to seperate districts.- And FINALLY!!! SHOW ME WHAT A CHOICE WOULD AFFECT (This is my biggest recommendation!). For the love of all things merry... When a choice needs to be made and ""I have to choose what to tell the engineers of the railroad bridge"" please tell me what each choice would do to me. I understand that the game was designed to allow the player to make choices and those choices affect you down the line randomly... but sometimes I like to make choices based on what they affect.			"

												Actually an interesting game to play, just a bit difficult, although after playing it for a couple of hours, I can finally say that the learning curve is not too steep as I previously thought.  You can pick and research technologies which may unlock edicts and certain services to improve the city life for your civilians, becareful, it can be incredibly easy to go into debt and eventually be voted out by other political parties, use your 'good will'' wisely ,use it too much, will make them hate you and will be impossible for you to pass your edicts and laws.

												Fairly hard learning curve, and you currently aren't able to save during the ""tutorial,"" which takes upwards of a few hours (god forbid you need to leave your house at some point in the day...). Overall, it feels as though the game wasn't quite field-tested enough before release, and certainly needs continual patching.Since release, we've already seen a few patches, mostly fixing random, small bugs, rather than the larger problems in the game, such as lack of maps/map diversity, only having 4 families (character groups) to choose from, and the extremely disproportionate cost of things like infrastructue and amenities such as theatres to income potential. In addition, even if you play the tutorial to the end, a lot of the basic game mechanics go essentially unexplained, such as the importance of district infrastructure, density/spread, and how employment/business bankrupcy works.It's definitely a good game, with a lot of potential, and I do recommend picking it up if it goes on sale, but it's not a must-have. With time, and a dev team that cares about fixing it, Urban Empire could definitely be a game to rival the great city-sims of the gaming world.			"

												This is a game based on a great idea and that have the basic feature of a promising game. It's clearly not finished. There is many thing to add and to correct. First, the pace. After a fey playthrough, I feel that science is going a bit weirdly. When I was at the 4th age, evens talked about computer, but my city was still without electricity... An other time, I arrived in the 60' without having upgraded any road or anything... Second, party act a bit weirdly and unpredicably. There is no clear link between district and election of one or another party. I wanted to have a very egalitarian city, with no ""upper class"" district with more services... and there was none... but I wasn't able to see if it has any effect in the election... and there is absolutely no info about the relation between the population and the party...Third, I felt in many games that I even had no effect of the party themselves. I wanted to be close to one and he was rejecting me for no reason...Forth, and it was noted in many review, the policies are not clearly organised on party lines...Still, I recommend the game, because the idea is good, it is still fun and, like the game from paradox like Europa Universalis and Crusader kings, I have hope that it's just a vanilla game on wich will be built many DLC that will make this game great again! ;)			"

												I'm really enjoying this game -- managing relationships with political parties, begging/forcing what I know to be best for the city, trying to not burn so many bridges that I can no longer be re-elected...all while pushing for equal rights for all citizens, advancing technologies, etc.I also enjoy the deep-dive you can do on stats.  At one point in the year 1914, I discovered that my town of ~3000 people had a whopping 22 movie theaters, and the number one employer of middle class citizens?  Movie production companies.  I'm a burgeoning Hollywood!The biggest minus is that the game frequently freezes on my laptop, AND THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE ABILITY.  I have to remember to manually save every year or so.Also, a lot of things are unexplained in the game...even in the tutorial...but I liked trying to learn as I went along.  I will say I was disappointed to see that things like electricity and plumbing didn't really change the look of my city.  In fact, the technological advances don't seem to actually advance technology at all.  People in my city were driving cars before we discovered the combustible engine which unlocks the automobile.  My entire city was on the telephone grid before we had electricity.  Perhaps most egregious, my character had to win re-election before citizens actually had the right to vote.But all in all, this is a new kind of game and I'm fully on board with where it's going.  8/10.

												Despite the resemblance to other city-builders such as SimCity and Cities: Skylines, Urban Empire is first and foremost a political simulator.  You play the role of mayor of a city located in the fictional nation of Swarelia and you'll be responsible for guiding your city through five different time periods, from the industrial revolution to the modern era.  Like the city-building games mentioned before, you will oversee the growth and development of your city, zoning residential, commercial and industrial districts as well as adding service buildings (police stations, hospitals, churches, etc) and issuing edicts.  However, you do not rule with absolute authority - the decisions you make are subject to approval by the city council.  The council is made up of multiple parties, each with their own agenda, so it may be necessary to appease the voters order to get them to see things your way.Here is a quick run down of the pros and cons of this game.PROS:- Good quality graphics - any changes are visually displayed on the city view screen such as adding street lights or upgrading roads from dirt to cobblestone, etc.- Extensive tech tree that allows you to upgrade your city in a variety of ways.- Detailed statistics screens on a variety of subjects.- Game features multiple dynasties to play as, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, adding some replayability to the game.- The political wheeling and dealing you engage in is quite fun.- Detailed tutorial that offers advice as you play the game.CONS- Some of the statistics can be a little confusing.- The UI is not the friendliest.- While the tutorial is detailed, it can also be intrusive at times.- There aren't that many maps to play on.- Gameplay can feel repetitive at times, I suspect the developer is looking to flesh this out with DLC.- The city-building aspect is a little basic.CONCLUSIONOverall, it's a fun game that's not without its flaws.  If you enjoy city-builders, but are looking for something a little bit different, I think you will like this.			"

												After several games of total puzzlement I got it. It's a game about keeping your powder dry, choosing when to apply leverage to the politians, choosing when to use your own funds to make changes... if you want a light city builder, this isn't for you. It's in depth, it's for players that like playing the long game.			"

												This game has a good premise and a good twist on the city builder genre, but unfortunately it just does work in the way it should.The first problems is that anything you want to happen to the districts has to go through the council and wastes time (in my opinion) .Secondly it the tutorial takes for ever to get through and slow down progress.Thirdly there are thing that you have to do to advance time, like setting research(which costs money and can set you into debt)Overall, not a bad game but has alot of flaws that put me off continuing playing this game.

												So... you want to play Sim City + The Guild? You're in the right place.I've only finished my first full play through. I started once before and realized I had not set myself up for success very well.In the early stages, it seems you want to nail down getting some districts up. Things must be at least somewhat large for your city to make income. You definitely want your city to have money. The politicians are very reluctant to let you do just about anything if you don't have money in the bank for it.I think some people are disappointed because their vision was just a little different than what the game is. One aspect of this is the way I hear some people describe the game as basically on rails. Those criticisms range from choices having no affect at all to revisionist history not being possible.I think the game has more depth than people are immediately aware of. I also think making it through will be a challenge.There is some degree of ""riding waves"" here. I wouldn't say things are on rails because it isn't such a fair criticism since I'm pretty sure there are tons of different rails. The trick is getting your train on different tracks. You control technology, so you have decent control over what edicts hit the table. You can also sway public opinion so that different parties gain and lose public favor.I made it up to the third era but was voted out of office.The game definitely forces choices, but it seems this is very intentional design. The game isn't always about steering the ship exactly where you want. It's more about looking at the available options and making the best choices at the time so that you have more power to steer somewhere you want.I think the game is good, and there are still three other houses I haven't tried yet. At somewhere around $2/hr, I'd definitely say it's worth it.They do need to address performance issues, however. The game doesn't seem to be able to handle a whole city. I have a fairly good rig and it is sluggish with pretty much all graphics options turned off. Maybe lowering the resolution would help more, but really?			"

My only issue is the periods of time when Im doing nothing with the game sitting at 4x speed, perhaps there could be more micromanaging to occupy time in between votes etc...also it doesnt feel as much like a city-builder (i.e Tropico) as I would like, I would say its definitely worth it if depending on price of the game and future content. Kalypso usually has lots of DLC content which will hopefully increase the depth and replayability. Ill definitle keep checking back in.			"

												A city builder with teeth. Finally. I won't sugar-coat it: there are flaws. The simulation underlying the mechanics is obtuse and REALLY needs more info exposed to the player while in-game, but a few hours playing with it will tell you a lot. Just don't expect to ""win"" on your first, second, or even third attempt. It also needs more agency on the part of the AI - the city council can stop you from doing things, but rarely does anything that would benefit the city itself. I'd like to see them propose districts on their own to help out stuck players, because it's easy to get into a situation where you're bankrupt and unable to advance, and there's only one gameplay event that helps with this. I'd also like more maps, more variety of history events for the various families (or even a random family altogether), and an ahistorical mode to help replayability. But as the game is, currently, it's still fun and worth the price.			"

												The concept is great, one I have often thought about and I give the developer kudos for trying to deliver it.  I feel like it will get to a better point soon with the patches.The pros:Voting and party goals are clear, persuasion seems pretty well done.Reactive events based on city conditions are nice.City advancing through time is pretty good as well.Simulation is pretty deep in most places.Historical accuracy seems pretty good.The cons:UI has missing tooltips, confusing tooltips, tons of information about stuff but does a poor job explaining what those numbers mean.  Very hard to figure out why businesses are doing well or poorly.Social class seems tied strictly to education, too much education in your town and you run into a shortage of working class people and your businesses suffer from lack of efficiency, too little education and you run into a shortage of middle class people and your businesses suffer from lack of quality.  Could use some flexibility to let working class step up as managers and let middle class do manual labor and migrate classes that way.  An end game tech automation does help quite a lot to alleviate the problem of over educationDistrict infrastructure... districts are expensive, infrastructure is expensive, and the benefits of infrastructure except for roads is so minor you can safely ignore building any.  Service buildings give so much more effect per cost.Edicts generally have a fixed cost, so for a large city they can give huge boosts for almost no cost.  Somehow you can end up helping the poor for 10k a month with 10k poor in your city and they all end up with +20 cash to spend in your shops generating money from thin air.Tax those people!  Taxing people doesn't seem to hurt them much at all, just keep raising the rates.  Not being able to afford basic goods isn't a problem as long as you can visit that nice library.  Businesses seem to react properly to taxes, but people really don't seem to care too much.  They also don't seem to mind being unemployed either.Mixed:The game is hard, I love that, but I'm sure many people don't.  Part of the difficulty is the poor UI, which is bad, but the balance of a lot of things makes it fairly difficult until you figure out how to exploit the things that aren't quite balanced right.  That said, the game really could use difficulty options.  There is a fairly organic difficulty based on how fast you try to grow/advance your city and going for the different win conditions, but the lack of any kind of difficulty setting is kind of strange.After all that negative why am I recommending this game still?  I think it has potential.  It reminds me of older simulation games that are deep, complex, and challenging.  I feel like a bit of balance, polish, and tooltips could really improve the game.  I had a lot of fun playing it despite its flaws.  I'm one of those weird people who end up not liking a game with 99% positive reviews and likes a lot of games with mixed reviews.			"

												Though it feels unfinished, I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  Mostly because it wasn't always apparent what was happening on the surface, it required digging into and tracking the data available in the menus in order to build a succesful metropolis.The polical aspect of the game is unfinished (hopefully..) after the 3rd era I could find no point in fighting to figure out how to appease the parties.  Instead you can just let the partys do there thing and save up your prestige to overrule them when they vote you out of office. I would definitely recomend this to anyone who enjoyed The Guild II, and Democracy III!			"

Product received for free
												In the campaign mode, you’ll lead a mayoral family from 1820 until (hopefully) 2020. Although the general mechanics play out the same each time, a large variety of events make each game slightly different. The main difference between Urban Empire and more traditional city builders is that most everything is put to a vote, so politics and relationships with parties matter. Districts are placed with zoning layouts, services, and infrastructure support. The city council must approve new districts through a vote; they also will vote on tax rate changes, modifications to existing districts, edicts, and service funding levels. Goodwill can be spent persuading parties to vote your way. A research tree contains inventions that unlock new services and edicts. Citizens have needs in several areas (such as social life, environment, health, and fun) that can be fulfilled by placing services. Urban Empire is a challenging game: it is difficult to consistently turn a monthly profit and still satisfy the needs of the citizens, and getting votes passed requires balance and skill. With an injection of meaningful political considerations, Urban Empire stands out as a city management game.

												This game is refreshingly new, and deep. At the beginning of the game you are the emperors nominee, meaning that you easily can force your will through the council. But as time passes, the more complex political landscape gets to you. Do you cling to your personal values, at the risk of alienating the powerful Christian Democratic party? What if you use all your political powers to stop the 10-hour workday, to protect your income, you risk beeing left helpless at the mayoral elections, and being voted out of office.I see people compare it to Civilization and Democracy III. It is clearly way better than Democracy III, but it is to different from Civilization to make the comparison. Further, if you think that this is the vanilla version(and it is awesome!), things are only going to get better! (remember the launch of Sim-City anyone?)			"

It just doesnt make sense that a city can't support something so simple as running water for everyone without taxes being at 25%!If the finance portion of the game was fixed either allowing loans or development grants or something.  I do recommend this game for the first 2 eras as they are easy, but when youre forced to have cobblestone streets in the 1970 with nothing but gaslamps in a few districts and no one having running water its a bit ridiculous. Especially considering this game is supposed to take place in Europe, not sub-saharan africa.			"

												Urban Empire is a failing pile of garbage.  Playing this game genuinely annoyed me.  The people who made this embarrasment should be ashamed of themselves.  It's not a city builder.   It's an ""irritation simulator.""			"

												not a very good game, game play isnt great and tries to take parts from other games and smash them together in the hope they work, would not recommend getting this game and i guess in the future the isses might be resolved but for now i would hold out on spending the £34.99 and buy other games which are a lot cheaper and will give you hours of fun			"

												Edit: The original review was written under the assumption that a lot of the minor bugs would be fixed in the weeks after launch. However, the game seems to be published with a fire and forget attitude. Therefore i can't reccomend it anymore. ------------------------------Urban Empire is not a city building game. In Urban Empire your main goal will be to stay in control. If you want to place something as trivial as a police station, you have to be able to pay for it, pay the service costs, have your political allies and enemies approve it during a vote and be sure that the running costs don't kill your city long time. Personally, i didn't have any technical issues but there's some reports in the Forums you might wanna check out. The overall gameplay is fine but feels lacking in some aspects and now and then it's not exactly clear how some things play together until you've done some trial and error. However, overall it still makes for a good and unique game. If you're looking for a relaxing city builder, there are better options available. If you're looking for something you have to work into but is quite rewarding this might be for you. It's certainly not for everyone - but that's what steam refunds are for.			"

												UPDATE: Having beat the game, I wouldn't recommend it at any price. The novelty wears off towards the second half of the game (only a few hours in, it's a short game) and it just becomes boring. Somehow it becomes even easier, but more tedious. Not to mention the complete lack of an epilogue (you get a pop up that says you win and asks if you want to continue playing or exit to the main menu.)Interesting game with a mix of city building and political simulation, though both are very simplified. The game is incredibly easy, I'm not sure that it's possible to lose. If you lose your re-election, you can always override the decision (it's treated like a council vote) for a few prestige points, which you are undoubtedly overflowing with. I would recommend picking this up during a Steam sale. $40 is too much for this game, but for $20 it would be a good deal.			"

												This is a pretty fun and different. However, the AI parties are pretty terrible. When I'm facing budgetary deficits in the last era they reject the infrastructure measures that are actually designed to save money on infrastructure spending (Like converting transport to automated) in each district. Why would the parties vote against something that would cost-costs at no expense to the people in the district?! As a result I just ended up going into debt pretty quickly with no way of reducing costs, despite the economic boost from all the business edicts and edicts that help citizen income on private companies.Also, it would be better if there was a  to when newer upgrades and ordinances are available, as it can be cumbersome and tiresome to keep checking which update.

												One of the political parties that didn't like me much said that I was cheating on my wife. I countered that they were having orgies! Where else can you give a response like that in a game. Oh and my long lost pal, Peniltimo sent me a llama! Acting as mayor; you are at the whim of the city council. This is a different take if you think about Cities XL, Cities: Skylines, and Sim City as you are more concerned with governmental mayoral things rather than creating a city. I like this game but it won't keep me in it much. For those that are old enough to remember the choose your own adventure books (I;m carbon dating myself), at one point it's exciting but then the next you start feeling bored and wishing you can call early elections and send the City Council packing. The council doesnt like when I rezone and at times create another district. The zoning tool is a little bit of a mess. It tells you your zone is too small and/or illegal angle thinking you want to save money and not build a huge zone; nope. It has to be really big and of course suck your avalable money rather quickly.My system meets the minimum requirements but not the recommened requirements yet everything is pretty smooth on very high settings. If I could give a maybe vote; I'm torn in between. I would definately watch how this game evolves. For those where money is tight; I would wait for this to go on sale. For those looking for a different take as a city mayor; it's not bad but gets boring and repetive quickly. Starting a new game just gives you the same ""scenarios."". Still playing so I will edit as I move along. Right now the City Council can't stand me. I threatened all of them and I;m digging dirt on one group. I blocked their vote so ha! I told them I would oppose their next vote that they brought fourth, I showed them lol. They weren;t impressed.			"

  TL;DR  I'm not very happy with the game in its current state.It's lacking a real challenge, and the political parties feel like regular obstacles to make it harder. For me, it also lacks more options for ""perfectionists"" like me to ""micro-manage"" the city to the final and last detail, like for example managing the road grids, instead of just three options for it. The price I also feel is too much for what it is now. If updates bring more, I'll maybe buy it again and see if it makes a difference.I really don't know what to say about this game.... A part of me likes it, and a part of me doesn't.The main reason is because this game was much more ""lean back"" than I expected, it automatically builds road grids, and automatically decides where and how much to put industrial, residential etc. I expected a much more Cities: Skylines type of thing, with political implementations. Instead what I got, was a boring ""don't worry about this we'll do it for you!"" type of game. No challenge at all, hardly anything to do, and things become repetitive quickly. I also noticed the graphics of the buildings degrade a lot when you're not zoomed in on them, they literally become white squares with black windows (played on ultra).I'll list some of my Pro's and Con's. Pro's - Game was fun and intriguing for the first hour.- Feels and  is  different from other city management/builders.- The soundtrack is amazing. Con's - Graphics could be better.- Price tag is drunk, even the 35€ pre-order price I paid for it.- Game becomes dull quickly.- The AI is as dumb as me.- The UI is confusing, and the ""benefits"" from doing things are poorly explained. 5% Sales demand = ?. Conclusion I wish Steam had an option that was in between ""Yes"" or  ""NO"" .If you like really easy city management/builders with close to no manual control over the layout with political implementations, this might be for you. If you're willing to pay 45€.I think a more fitting price would be around 15 - 20€.For now, I'm going to give this a no. I'll probably try to get a refund.If updates supposedly improve upon the game, I'll maybe buy it again and try it out.But again, for now, I'm not happy with the game in it's current state.  Should you buy it? Maybe, I think a price reduction would make it worth it. The game is still getting updated, so hopefully they'll add something to make it better.  4,5/10   "

												I'm updated this review to not recommended. Why? The game basically suffers from bugs, lack of certain indicators regarding the economics to understand why something is happening and a major lag near the last era's. All this take a lot of fun out of what would be a rather nice game overall. It seems the developer is not commited to making a lot of updates to address the issues since after plenty of time, none of them were fixed. Also the team doesn't make the community really feel it will address those / is commited to the game, so recommending it is a far stretch. My advice would be cheap buy / stay away - until it's properly fixed.  ---I like this game. It's an interesting new way of dealing with cities and politics. It's in no way a city builder since most of the time you can't build the city you want ( adding to both appeal and frustration of the game - but that's politics ). There are many ways to get way you want though and trying to mayor through the era's it's quit interesting to see how it all develops. There seem to be enough replayability trying different strategies ( high taxes vs low taxes, high level of services vs laissez-faire etc ) . The main problems are connected with a lack of explanation ( why is a district developing or not is hardly explained ) and not always clear what the choices are the game is trying you to have.  Also hopefully the dev's will look a little at the performance which drops in the later game. Tl;dr - Good game, needs a few updates to become really good.			"
