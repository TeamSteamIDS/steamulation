Early Access Review
								I've been playing pinball, off and on, for over 50 years, and I've played hundreds of tables. I've played every table by both major companies on Steam to the tune of many thousands of games, but all that is pretty much in the past, because I have discovered Pro Pinball Ultra's ""Timeshock"" table. Most days it’s the only pinball I play.In the 35 days since Timeshock was released 0n 1/27/16, I've recorded over 1,200 games. And I've yet to even BEGIN to be bored with playing the same table, mostly because Timeshock has so much depth and challenge. It's hard! I would go so far to say that even with its ""novice"" mode, it's not a table for beginners, but it IS the table to strive toward playing, no matter one's skill level, or the amount of time one has to devote.With Timeshock's many challenging modes, including a 4-level video mode that really adds tremendously, there is no clue when a game begins if it will end with a score of 3 million, or 300 million....or much more. I tend to have a short attention span and often get frustrated fairly easily, but at least for me, Timeshock is pretty much rage-proof, because it's just so MUCH fun to play! (And I’m really only an average pinball player.) The challenge of some shots is the very source of the tremendous feeling of success I sometimes get, and I can honestly say that with time comes much greater proficiency, and tremendous personal satisfaction.Timeshock offers a very complex story about time travel, and the acquisition of artifacts from the varying periods visited.  The table guide I typically use, by Jens Goering -  http://www.jeeens.de/t/t.html , is 32 pages of valuable information and graphics, very well written and structured. Clearly, this is no simple table to be mastered overnight, but rather a commitment than might require years of pure joy.Not only is the Timeshock table itself interesting and challenging, there are numerous varying methods of play to choose from, each adding its own dimension of fun. As well, each has its own leaderboard to track progress against players the world over. It even has an unusual “glass removed” feature that allows the player to investigate the table actions in great detail (but does not count on leaderboards.) If a player had done well on the first three balls during any regular game, Timeshock offers the opportunity to extend the game by up to three additional balls for what offers the possibility of REALLY high scores for the best players. And Timeshock has my ALL-TIME favorite score in pinball; Lucky!, a 5 million point shot when you almost lose the ball down the left outlane. (Admittedly, I haven’t personally accessed many of the high-score features, so please forgive and notify if errors have been made in this review.)At first glance it might seem that Timeshock is more expensive than most single computer pinball tables, and I really bought it because I had heard so much about it for so long. (It is a truly legendary pinball table, perhaps the MOST renowned single computer pinball table available.) But while I paid about $15US, after a little over a month it comes to just over a penny a game, a pittance I’m grateful didn’t prevent me from THE pinball experience of my lifetime.Perhaps one of the finest features of Timeshock came on Day One when I was unable to complete installation on one of my laptops. The DEVs requested pertinent info from my PC, and within 2 -3 days had graciously corrected the problem. As I often say, perhaps the best feature of any game is an attentive DEV. (Thank you, all.)If you love pinball and want both a great challenge AND great fun, Timeshock will very likely be THE pinball experience you will never regret considering.(As with most Steam games, offline Timeshock play is not tracked.)

								In terms of user experience when you're getting started, this is really very much ""Early Access"".But the actual pinball table itself? Wow, it is an absolute work of art. The lighting, the effects, the physics - it's all spot on. It feels right. This feels like a real pinball table in a way most other video pinball just doesn't. Suddenly, as I began to play, I wished with all my heart that all of the tables on Farsight's ""The Pinball Arcade"" could be recreated by Barnstorm Games instead, to do those old beloved tables justice in a far more accurate preservation. Barnstorm Games' love for pinball is present in every minute detail. It's there in the travel of the ball. It's there in the gentle reflections of light. It's there in the click of the flipper. The ka-chunk of the targets.Even the physics in the in-table video mode DMD game are better than I would expect from a pinball table!If you love pinball, actual real pinball tables, try this game. Treat yourself! You will love it and it will love you back.However, let me get back to details on what's so ""my goodness this is so Early Access"". When I first downloaded the game through Steam, I thought to myself ""Oh, only ~700MB? That's pretty small!"" - then I started it up and rather than letting me into the game and giving me an option to log in as a minor feature, the first thing I saw when I started up the game were some big ugly grey boxes, asking me to log in, or play as guest. I thought to myself ""I kickstarted this, so I probably have a login somewhere...."" - so I spent a good long while activating a forum account, retrieving a password, then activating that password. Then I logged in. Thankfully you only seem to need to do that once!Then the next thing I see is a dialogue box telling me that it's downloading another ~500MB of data. Then it unpacks it. Then I'm in! So I go ""hey, I wonder if logging in did anything special!"" and click on Account. It looks like it did nothing special. So I click on the arrow to go ""back"", and it black screens so I need to exit the app entirely.Then I decided to try playing the table. And it crashes out again. So I restart the game, and it works this time. Now, there aren't any instructions for keys when you're looking at the table, nor on the pause menu, so I went through pressing all the keys on my keyboard to see if I could start a game. I didn't find it (fyi - you press the ""S"" key!) so I exited, then saw the instructions (and story!) under a little icon on the (mostly empty) main menu.The actual table makes up for everything. But still - there's a lot of things they still need to do to make the overall experience of starting the application and getting into the game much better.			"

												July 22 Update: Out of Early Access, and going strong. Still easily recommended to purchase.June 27 Update: Forced to run on Low settings before my computer upgrade. Now, Max settings run GLORIOUSLY. If you have a high end rig, you definitely won't be disappointed with the light settings and sequences.Original: Don't underestimate the value of Pro Pinball series. Especially Timeshock. Even the original series still holds up excellently today -- amazing ball physics, rulesets, and audio. If you want this for cheaper, get the 3 tables -- Timeshock, Big Race USA, and Fantastic Journey -- for $6 each. You'll still support the developers who are making this game, but you'll ultimately be missing out on an even more realistic experience.This version has been made even better than before. Pro Pinball is now more graphically enhanced, especially around dazzling light shows. It's still in Early Access (more features to come, as stated in the Store description), but this is a must-buy, even if the $15 price tag seems unsettling for just 1 table (Unlike companies that produce multitudes of tables, Pro Pinball treats its games as simulations that CLOSELY compare to the real thing, giving a more realistic experience). And yes, the remaining games will be remastered as well.Got my first ULTRA Jackpot on this version. Without the need of Glass Off Mode.			"

								This is hands down the best pinball simulation in existence. Photorealistic graphics, a superb table layout and amazing ball physics that feel like the real thing.Yes, you are only getting one table. But that table is so loaded with modes and features that it will take you forever to experience everything it has to offer. In fact, this table is so good that it's getting made into a real pinball machine[www.pinballnews.com].The only bad thing about this game is the super slow development process.			"

								The best pinball table in the world has been given a fantastic modern overhaul faithful to the original in every way!My experience with pinball started at an age when I could barely see the action on the table and over the years I have always enjoyed trying new tables when the opportunity has presented. Have also owned what is considered to be one of the best ever designed physical tables - the twilight zone. Ever since the original pro pinball timeshock came out around 20 years ago it was clear to me that this was an exceptionally designed game in every way.The fact that now,with updated graphics,controller support (no input lag finally!) 64 bit compatability and a beautiful UI/menu design (and it is still a work in progress!) shows that the saying "" true classics never age"" is so true.I would also like to pass on that the team behind this amazing remake (I believe it is the original dev's) have done amazing work and I commend them for their quality and attention to detail - well done! ,please keep up the good work! :)   "

								In the historical development of designing pinball machines and video games, TimeShock! continues to stand the ""test of time"". When it was originally developed using actual CAD and pinball engineering software, it was WAY ahead of even real pinball machines. It used too many feature lamps on the matrix, actual accurate switch location design was not really considered, and the physical mechanics were not directly feasible (Time Crystal, ramp alignment, etc) based on what was included in the virtual game among other factors. It is an absolute classic that although has taken FOREVER to get to this stage, is still worth the time and money.If you want to complain about this only being one table, go play Pinball Arcade by Farsight Studios.  The ball physics of this table, however, are much more accurate and the detail of the table is refined.My credentials for assessment review of this pinball simulation are direct and simple.I restore pinball machines as a collector, technician, and operator and have done so for well over a quarter century.  I still maintain a large ""stable"" private collection of machines.I am not a millenlial gamer.I was involved the Bally/Williams pinball department in the 1990s.I am intrinically aware of the challenges and design of pinball machines at both an electronic and physical level.Currently, this simulation is being developed as a sample prototype machine by Silver Castle Pinball.  Scheduled for demonstration at Pinball Expo in Chicago in 2016.It is coming...			"

								Timeshock! is the pinball that survived nearly 20 years. I'm sure that game is responsible for many smashed keyboards and controllers. Well, now is the good time for some vengeance: you can take the glass off, grab the ball and shove it into whatever hole you like! Screaming in joy is optional, but very recommended.Finally nailed a 10-way first time in my life!			"

The visuals have had a major upgrade over the original game. The original game was rendered in high resolution (1600x1200 IIRC) which to this day looks really sharp. When playing this one, you can really appreciate just how much more detail there is over the original game.If you like pinball games or played the original, buy it :)			"

												The best pinball simulation ever, I have no doubt about that. What I am upset about is that Barnstorm seem to have ceased all development (or at least they are refusing to talk about it) and ""the ultimate physics engine"" that was promised back when this was a Kickstarter project has so far failed to materialise. Thus, the later Pro-Pinball titles from the 90s have more advanced physics than this. You should still buy this if you want to play the deepest pinball game ever devised.			"

												Everything I wanted in an update of this game, except that it doesn't include The Web.  For those moaning about the download in-game before play - it's a clever solution to the reality that on PC, you have a huge range of resolutions, and that the game uses pre-rendered graphics, and you want it to look pristine at almost all resolutions - and oh my, but what pre-rendered graphics these are, especially with the adjustable lights! - if they were all included in the game download, the game would be over a hundred GB big.If you haven't played a Pro Pinball game before... basically they're still the best original pinball tables I've ever played.  Tons of depth in a single table - Timeshock here takes an hour gameplay to hit the final feature.For the amount you can play this table, the asking price is a steal.  And they've even thrown in DMD support and all the other trimming for those lucky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s with a virtual pinball cabinet.  Amazing.			"

								An immaculate update to an all-time classic.The original 1997 Timeshock! still looks and runs great today, despite being almost 20 years old, but the much improved reflections, dynamic lighting and the support for larger resolutions and modern operating systems makes this £10 update completely worth it. Those familiar with the original game will feel right at home, because although the ball physics are vastly improved, the table still feels exactly the same.Glass-Off mode is a welcome addition too, as it lets you practice tricky shots and combos, and allows you to advance through difficult missions just by clicking the ball and flicking it where it needs to go (great for when you're curious about some of the later missions but lack the skill to reach them legitimately!).Performance is excellent; I've never dipped below 60 FPS, even during intense multiballs. The game generally hovers at around 120-150 FPS on an FX 8350 and HD7970 at 1440p and 4x MSAA when a single ball is in play. I've seen it go as low 75 FPS when there are seven balls on the table.In the future I'd like to see options added for table tilt, flipper strength and level of wear (some of my favourite features to play with in Big Race USA), and of course, more tables! I'd be very excited to see The Web, Big Race USA and Fantastic Journey recieve the same treatment as Timeshock! Maybe a brand new table as well? Fingers crossed.			"

								Timeshock is still the very best pinball game for PC. If you like pinball or are just even slightly interested in it, buy it now.This is a graphically updated version of the excellent pinball simulation Timeshock from 1997. The Pro Pinball series was the absolute top of PC pinball back then and has not been surpassed since. This updated version does the game justice. The updates include higher resolution, better lighting and portrait mode, which of course works great for pinball.The table itself is unchanged, which is a good thing. It remains one of the best tables I have ever played virtual or real. The table design is perfect, the shots have exactly the right difficulty and feel very satisfying. The ruleset is very deep, there are an incredible number of modes, super modes, wizard modes, frenzys, manias, video mode... etc. which will keep all but the most seasoned pinball veteran occupied forever. (I have played this table for almost 20 years and never reached the super wizard mode in normal play.) The modes and table elements all interact to form a path and a story. Still, the table keeps a simple elegance and is not overwhelming, even for beginners. The updated graphics are gorgeous, the light show at the beginning of the time travel mode is one of the best in any pinball machine. The sound and music were not upgraded, but still do the job nicely. The guitar music soundtrack is a matter of taste, I personally like it a lot. There are different tracks for different game situations and modes and they fit very nicely.This is a simulation of a real world pinball table, there even is an operator's menu to tweak the internal settings of the machine. That also means it is quite difficult, especially compared to the more arcady games like Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade. The table is unforgiving, but never unfair. Through the operator's menu the game can be made easier, but for me the standard settings work well.There are a few things that are still missing: UI to change default controls, controller support and more table views. I was the most disappointed that they have not improved the physics to at least the level of the later Pro Pinball games „Big Race USA” and “Fantastic Journey” yet, I hope this is coming soon. The current physics model is from the original game. It is by no means bad and feels very real. It is in every way superior to other games like Pinball Arcade. But the physics of the later Pro Pinball games are even better and I was hoping that 20 years later and with superior hardware, this could have been taken up another notch.These things are promised, unfortunately Barnstorm Games has not exactly convinced with speed on what is a mere upgrade and has struggled through 2 years of development. I hope they can improve their development process and dedication to the PC platform, implement the missing features soon and hopefully even upgrade the other old tables and design new ones.While the price of this game is higher than other tables on the market, it is absolutely justified by the superior simulation. The table design is on a completely different level than Pinball FX tables and the realism and graphics easily and clearly surpass Pinball Arcade. This table makes these other pinball games look bad by comparison. It would be amazing if the Pinball Arcade developers could reach the same level of detail and realism. The table design can absolutely compare to some of the best real tables out there, so it is not surprising that there is a company working on a real world version of Timeshock.I have been playing the original for almost 20 years and I know I will play this for at least as long. For an early access game it is already very much playable and I can recommend it highly to both pinball experts and beginners.			"

								It's early to write a review for 'Pro Pinball Ultra,' as it's not finished, so I'll write a small one for Timeshock instead.One of the best pinball tables ever designed I'd say; I think that's fair. As far as virtual/digital pinball goes, I think it is only beaten by one table: Fantastic Journey. FJ had the last and best physics that Barnstorm created, but I think a lot of the rubber on the table was firmer too (less bouncy) and maybe that's why I prefer it.Writing a review is tricky here: I'd give the original Timeshock 10/10. The score would be due to the table design AND the implementation (the physics, the views given, the virtual DMD, the soundtrack, everything about it). But lots of that stuff in not done for this version of Timeshock yet, and the physics will be changed (note that it was stated that there would be an option included to allow play with the original physics; not sure how leaderboards will deal with this though).So it's tricky to review 'Pro Pinball Ultra' you see.Personally, I expect Barnstorm to put in all the time needed to make it as good as it can possibly be: I have that faith. I feel safe recommending the game that will be, but as I write this review the original 'finished' Timeshock is better.			"

								without a doubt one of the greatest pinball simulations ever made, now in 4k.fair warning, though: it will kick your butt. i've been playing this for about 15 years now and I haven't made it to the Timeshock Frenzy on default settings a single time. but it's never not fun to play - even if you don't get to the end, you will almost certainly play through a well-designed set of missions and features, some fun multiballs, the brilliant Video Mode (which could probably be spun off into its own little runner game) and a damn fine light show, which now looks better than ever.if you love pinball, play it. if you enjoy the odd spot of pinball, check it out and I'm sure you'll fall in love yourself.

								This is the definitive version of the definitive Pinball game.Nothing compares to Pro Pinball in terms of good table design, realistic physics simulation and overall high-quality Pinball experience. Timeshock was already great back in the day, and the new, remade version only makes it even better.The graphics are amazing, and it feels just like a real Pinball table would, in a way other pinball simulators just can't emulate. You can really feel the attention to detail and the love for Pinball the Pro Pinball team have in every inch of the table. Just play any other pinball game out there and then play this one, and you'll know what I mean.The design of the table itself is also fantastic. There is so much to do and to discover, that it feels like a real adventure, and it'll keep you playing for hours and hours. A bit on the difficult side, but that's part of the charm.It's still in Early Access, so a few of the promised features are missign, specially some of the view angles and a decent interface for rebinding controls, but nothing that detracts from the main experience.tl;dr - If you enjoy Pinball games, then this is a MUST BUY. It really doesn't get any better than that.			"

												One of the best, if not the best, pinball simulation games out there. I've always been a fan of pro pinball games and they have always been top notch in my opinion. Strongly recommended if you want a realistic pinball game.			"

												I've lost count of the number of hours that I've spent on the original 1997 classic. Even to this day it's considered by many to be the best pinball game ever made. The ball physics are spot on and it's the only pinball game that I've played which actually feels like a real table. All the others just feel like computer games next to this.This Ultra HD remake plays identically to the original game but with much improved visuals. The pre-rendered graphics and lighting effects are virtually photo realistic and look better than the 3D graphics in other pinball games. The graphics scale well too and it runs super smooth on my seven year old PC which has a first generation Core i5 processor, 4GB of RAM and a HD5850 graphics card (a tip for people using low powered computers is switch the vsinc option off as this has a big hit on the frame rate). £10 for one table may not sound like good value but this table is such a gem it's worth every penny. There's more depth and replay value in this one table than there is in all of the Pinball FX and Pinball Arcade tables put together.The only minus point that I can think of is when I rotate my monitor by 90 degrees to play the game in portrait mode the screen has black borders at the top and bottom. Hopefully a future patch will sort this out so that I can play in full screen when the monitor is oriented vertically. Other than this minor issue there are no bugs in the game.10/10Just one more go...p.s. Empire Interactive please remake The Web or Big Race USA table next. They're much better than Fantastic Journey.			"

												Hello AllPlayed this game since its realese in 1997 where it ran like a dream under dos. Had a lot of trouble running it under windows xp (a patch fixed this) and later vista-windows 7 and 8. Had given up on seeing this game running on pc forever but then i found this. With this release on steam it is again running like a dream.Just bought a Samsung UE55KS7005 and testet the game on the television.Started with the 2180P mode witch is 4K.At first it did now run that well. Played around with the settings and when you change the resolution it downloads new textures but only the first time you set a resolution. On a fast internet connection it is quick. Found out that i was running some programs that made it run pourly. After closing those programs it ran ok but not smooth. I allso had some input lag witch is worse then the game not running smooth because when you press the controller you have some time before it reacts in the game. When playing it on my monitor i had no input lag. On the tv i switched on gaming mode and that removed all of the input lag.But the game still didnt run smooth. Backed the resolution down to 1440P and now it runs like a dream again.Thank you so much for this. This is and has allways been the best pinball game for pc. Looks fantastic on the 55"" tv and runs perfectly. It is a dream come true to play this game on big screen TV and it looks awesome.I do have some requests though... Could you ad Sourround sound and some VR support for HTC Vive?My rig setupi5 4950 - 8 gig ram - msi gaming 5 - nvidia gtx 970 100/100 mbit internet connection - HTC Vive - HP L2445w - Samsung UE55KS7005 "

												I wore out multiple keyboards on this excellent game back in the day, and am thrilled that it's been redone and updated.  It has definitely kept all the action and precise play of the original.  Even the 'feel' of the flippers is there!  Ball play is ultra smooth and ball weights and physics are dead on.FANTASTIC J..OB!!			"

												This is a remake of the original Pro Pinball: Timeshock. It looks good and play well. It wasn't my personal favorite among the Pro Pinball games however, so I find it hard to be really thrilled about it. Hopefully it'll pave the wave for more remakes, and perhaps even some new tables.If you like pinball games, this is a good choice.(I backed this project)			"

								So far, this is still Timeshock, with better visuals and lighting. If you liked the original Timeshock, you won't be disappointed with this.If you like pinball (either the real kind or the video game kind), and haven't played any Pro Pinball pc games, this is for you.			"

								So here it is - the Ultra edition of Pro Pinball: Timeshock. If the differences aren't immediately apparent, remember that's only because the 1997 original was so far ahead of the curve. The lighting effects in this version have to be seen to be believed - static screnshots don't really do them justice. Every piece of wire, every screw, every element is lit up by the hundreds of lights on the table and you can see every one of them reflecting and reacting to what's going on, it's *beautiful*. You'd swear they'd mounted a camera on a physical table and filmed it (at very, very high resolution!)The static camera is not an issue for me, although it's a pity there's only one choice of viewing angle and no cabinet mode (both allegedly to be added in future updates). Also, the physics are the same as the original version - not that the ball motion is especially bad, in fact not the worst on the market even 15 years later, but it would be nice to see some improvements in the state of the art.Of course a lot of people will complain that there's only one table in the game, it's true, but Timeshock has the deepest and best ruleset of any pinball sim I've seen. Better that than twenty-five copy-paste games with cosmetic differences but near-identical gameplay. If you have even the least interest in Pinball there's no excuse for not giving Timeshock a go.

								I used to play Timeshock(on dos) with my father when I was growing up. Getting to play this table again is just incredible.The visuals are pristine. Seriously, I hope others follow suit in the pre-rendered-to-layers graphical approach of this table, as the edge clarity, lighting, translucency, and detail surpass what's possible with real-time rendering as to be laughable. The physicality this yields the table is unmatched.In terms of gameplay, this remains one of the most interesting, deep, and well crafted 'narrative' pinball tables ever made. The soundtrack aids this tremendously as well. There are few pinball tables that manage to create the experience of a dramatic journey, and Timeshock certainly does.I own this on all its available platforms, play it in the can on my phone, play it in vertical-format on my PC now. (seriously, if your monitor can do portrait mode DO IT)If you love pinball, buying this is a no-brainer. Worth every cent.Current Early Access State: Needs custom control mapping, a true fullscreen mode. Will update review when these occur. "

												A VERY HARD TABLE TO MASTER. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST REAL LOOKING TABLE I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. CONTROLS A SOLID AND CRISP. NO LAG OR DELAY ON CONTROL INPUT TO ACTION ON THE SCREEN.  GREAT JOB!  IF THEY COULD ONLY INVENT MORE FULLY REALIZED TABLES LIKE THIS.  THAT WOULD BE AWESOME.  THIS IS DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY PINBALL PLAYER EVEN IF IT IS ONLY THIS TABLE. ITS A LIL PRICEY BUT WITH EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO COMPLETE ON THIS TABLE, (WHICH WOULD TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO MASTER IF AT ALL), ITS WORTH IT.			"

												I guess it's only fun if you played the original. Physics simulation seems awkward, does not believably reflect playing a real machine. 3d view appears cluttered and it's hard to see what's actually going on. Bought it at full price and it was definitely not worth it.			"

This is the first time i asked Steam for a refund! Here the reasons why:Everybody who reads my Google Plus - timeline on a daily basis, knows, that I totally love Pinball. I've been playing pinball all of my life, starting about 46 years ago with old fashioned electro- mechanic pinball machines. I've played nearly ALL pinball simulations that were available for any of my computers, tablets, smartphones and handheld consoles. I also own the original Pro Pinball- Timshock! that was released 1997. So i bought the new Pro Pinball Ultra Timshock! yesterday in hope of a great gaming experience, after the disaster that i had with ""Now Man's Sky"", but i was blown away - in a negative way. Here my issues: First i had to download about 1GB just to install the game. No problem so far. My Computer ( i7 3.4GHz, 32GB Ram, Geforce GTX680 2GB) runs a resolution of 2560x1440 natively. So i switched to that resolution inside of the game. What followed was a download of another 1.5GB  inside of the game and i could not even switch to another window to pass the time, because then the download simply holds! After the download finished i started the table. First i thought that the machine had crashed, because nothing seem to happen, but then i realized that a saw something more like a slideshow but not a game! So i decided to back out and change the resolution to 1080p and i had to wait again, because another 900MB had to download first. After i realized that even in 1080p the game does not react as quick and responsive as i liked it to, i decided that i'll tray to get a refund for Pro Pinball Ultra Timshock! This is a sad example on how to spoil an otherwise great game: Deliver a technical disaster.			"

												NOPE: HIDDEN DOWNLOADS!I had this game at least a decade ago, as it was content of a ComputerBildSpiele (this pamphlet sucks now:-( ) magazine disk. So I was really happy when I found it here on steam. But, it has a BIG downside: HIDDEN DOWNLOADS!If you don't have a high-speed 100 Mbit/s connection, then don't go for this game. Seriously this crud must stop - it's as cancerous as EA's DLC policy.P.S.: Dear steam admins: If you could make dev's post the true data size, so that users with slow connections can see a no-no, that would be great!

								I did not see anything great about this game in the amount of time I had to play it. However I can only play it for a few seconds before my computer crashes... in that time, as i looked over the game I didn't see anything that was very interesting. The only thing i liked about the game is that it offers an option to play it at 2560 x 1440, so i can load it on my monitor in portrait style, which makes the play area a lot larger than on a landscape oriented monitor and so there is no need for the game to alter the perspective of the table as you play. This was the first pinball game I bought for the pc and thought that maybe my computer wasn't powerful enough to run pinball games but then i took a chance and bought a bunch of pinball games from pinball arcade and i was able to play for hours without a problem. I have a core i7 3.4 GHz cpu with a firepro v7900 video card. Based on the fact that i am not able to play the game for more than a few seconds, and what I did see while playing it wasn't interesting to me, I should probably give it a one star out of five, but since it has the option to play at 2560 x 1440, which is an excellent idea, I will give it a generous two stars...also if the game worked for more than a few seconds, it's possible I would have discovered more about the game that I liked.

												EDIT: Although the Kickstarter/Early access of this game was horrible (read below) the game looks great now it's finally released. It looks very polished and play's just like the old game. They also finally added all the table views from the original game, which is a big plus.If you have any interest in pinball simulations, I wouldn't hessitate to pick this up.Early Access review:This game is okay, but in the end was not worth the wait in it's current state. First of all, the Kickstarter for this game was a disaster. Their promise was that with the money earned by the Kickstarter, they would be able to speed up development. This was in the end of 2013. Yes, 2013. They promised it would be finished at the start of 2014. With barely any communication they just contineud to postpone the release without actually telling anyone about the progress of the game.Next, the optimisation is very bad. The game might look pretty, but does not run well at all on any standard gaming pc. Also the angles of the tables are not changeble. And now the UI is actually on top of the table, the table looks very small and is not comfortable to play on (for me at least).I hope they will still be able to improve and optimise performance of the game and also add the angles THE ORIGINAL GAME had. But with this slow progress, the game probably won't be out of 'early access' before 2020.			"
