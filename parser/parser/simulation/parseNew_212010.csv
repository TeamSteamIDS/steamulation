												Well, let's start with the good.-As you can probably see from the screenshots, the game looks nice.-Fairly large, open universe.-The filler parts of the game are well designed and somewhat enjoyable. -It runs at a solid 60FPS-The voice acting is ok.Now for the bad:-The campaign is really short. I've clocked just over 7 hours and I've spent at least 3 of them mining and doing freelancer missions. The campaign itself is somewhere between 2 and 3 hours at best.-You don't get any advanced ships or weaponry during the campaign. All of the rewards from the story missions combine to about 100k which is the price of a single high end piece of equipment. Top of the line ships meanwhile cost upwards of 2 million. Thus you'll spend most if not all of the story flying a starter ship or one marginally better and if you want the end-game stuff, you'll have a lot of grinding to do.-While we're on the subject of the story, it's quite mundane. Without spoiling too much, it boils down to some gibberish-speaking aliens popping up all over the universe and stealing cargo and we have to stop them. Who are they, why are they doing this, is there more to this? Who cares, just shoot them.-The universe is underdeveloped. There are 4 different factions but I only noticed that when one of them started shooting me because I got friendly with their enemies. Who are they and why are they fighting is a mystery. Naturally, you can't affect the wars (which incidentally would've made for a much better campaign than what we got)-The combat. It feels like a poor man's Freelancer combat and that game is what... 10, 15 years old? I think it suffers from being developed for mobile devices.-Lack of support. Apparently the developers were very surprised (and quite unpleasantly so) by the fact that PC players didn't throw twenties at them for the 2 hour experience and they've decided to essentially take their ball and go home to the iOS crowd that has more money than brains. As a result this is all we're going to get. No patches, no DLC, no modding support, nothing.-The developers themselves. Looking over a few of their replies to their customers, reveals them to be quite arrogant and obnoxious.-The price. Frankly, the game is overpriced for what it is. If they had bundled the DLC with it, MAYBE it would be worth 20 bucks. As it stands, it most certainly isn't.In conclusion, while the game has it's moments, I can't recommend it at it's current price. If you can get it on sale 70% + off, go for it. Otherwise, stay away			"

												DO NOT BUY FOR PC! If you really want it, get it for your phone.At first I was rather excited about this. It is, in just about every way possible, a very basic, simplified, single-player version of Eve Online (even some of the ship/station names and appearances are a little too similar to be purely coincidence). It is a freelance space simulator where you are a pilot and must hop from starsystem to starsystem trying to make a living through mining, combat missions, bounty hunting, or even just freighting trade items from station to station. Then you can put your earnings towards whatever you need to further your goals, better mining equipment, tougher armor, better weapons, larger cargo holds. The idea is solid, but execution is lacking.Outside of the very very beginning of the game, mining became immediately useless as you could make far more cash in less time through combat missions. And by the end of the game even the combat missions had been phased out once you had a good cargo hauler and the ability to warp anywhere in the galaxy without having to system hop. You end up with 2 systems where you buy up all of an item for cheap, then warp to the other and sell it, then warp back and repeat.Your money also tends to just sit around. In my first hour and a half of playing I'd already found and purchanced (without the use of guides) the best armor, shields, scanner, tractor beam, repair bots, and mining laser. From there there was nothing left to upgrade apart from getting bigger ships and better weapons. And thats only cause the best weapons are pure luck as to whether you will find them, but I'd already secured the best readily available ones. It's flat upgrades across the board you are looking for and since you can sell items for the same price you buy them unlike most games, you never lose money. If its better, buy it, cause when you find the next upgrade you can just sell your current for full price and buy the next. Theres no reason to try and save money or skimp out on small upgrades as you can't really lose money even if you try.The game is also incredibly easy. At no point did I ever die while playing, or even come close as I recall. This game originated as a mobile phone game so the controls are very simple and oversensitive with a mouse, and enemy hitboxes are unrealistically large to the point its hard to miss.It was a mobile phone game that was poorly ported to PC. At multiple times my UI buttons would flicker on and off, some of the menus just wouldn't work requiring you close and open them a couple times, and trying to actually use any of the buttons on the HUD instead of hotkeys was the most aggrivating thing ever as it seemed to desire to actively fight swapping from having the mouse control flight to having the mouse control the UI. Click to swap to pointer mode, a second late it swaps you back to flight mode, click it again and yet again before you can get to your target button it swaps back to flight mode.Their worst mistake? They also decided to NOT INCLUDE THE DLC!! A horrible mistake as many parts of the dlc fixed many problems with the gameplay by adding some extra use to mining, so extra storylines beyond the single super short story, extra side missions hunting down high bounty criminals to extend the end game, adding automatic turrets to actually make turrets useful, adding extra ship equipment so you dont stagnate an hour into the game with the best stuff, extra ship and star systems to hit up for better missions and gear, a main base to call your own for storing items and ships so you can have more than a single ship at any given time, and this list could go on longer. With the DLC included, this would have been a decent freelance starfighting game worth picking up on sale and playing through in a weekend. Without the DLC it is a horrible thing that will get incredibly boring shortly into your playthrough and leave you feeling incredibly cheated out with just how little they give you to do. Sorry for the long post. Really wishing I'd gotten this on the phone instead...			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 isn't a bad game. The graphics are good, combat is okay, and there's a fair variety of missions. I cannot recommend it, however, because the game was functionally abandoned by its creator. GOF2 started as a tablet game, and like many such games, the best and most interesting parts are available as DLC. But Fishlabs only ported the core game to Windows, and they've made it crystal clear that nothing more is forthcoming because the Windows port ""didn't make enough money"" to bother supporting any further. For what I paid, I assumed that content was already included, and after finding out that it's not only not included, but it will *never* be available, I feel ripped off. There is no way this game is worth anywhere close to the asking price. Fishlabs Entertainment doesn't deserve your money because they don't support and stand behind their products.			"

												Okay, and for the real review. Do not get me wrong, this game is pretty good, but, this game can pretty much be completed within 6 hours.The graphics are good, it plays really well. The controls are responsive. But it's short lived without the DLC.It's free on Android and iOS, and you can pay $15.00 for the DLC not including the Kaamo Club + VIP.Honestly, if you have a good tablet I would say stick to playing this game on Android and iOS, instead of playing it on PC Steam because you're paying full price for an incomplete release of the game... It's really bogus and unfair, considering that deepsilver is selling this game on steam for this price with little to no hope of the dlc being released... This is a fun game, but you're better off staying on Android with this one.			"

												When I say I do not recommend this game, DO NOT TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY:Galaxy on Fire 2 is an amazing game in almost every aspect and I simply loved it on both mobile and pc. However, the cost for the PC version is simply too high, especially considering that none of the expansion packs are included or even available. If these expansion packs were to be added in future updates I would recommend without hesitation, but the cost and knowledge that ""Supernova"" and other expansions will never be added is too much.Great game, with some unfortunate mistakes. If its ever on sale though, consider getting it for sure.			"

												I have spent many hours playing this on an iPad and truly love the game. But without the additional content (and with the knowledge that it will never be released for PC) I would advise folks to pass on this one and any other game these developers put out. It is the add-ons that make the game fun...without them it is so-so. Frankly, I feel ripped off. Twenty bucks for half a game. If it is ever on sale for $3.99, pass anyway.			"

												A nice little game, which reminds me a lot of freelancer (in a way smaller version).You're taking control of a space-pilot, who is accidentally jumping foward in time and finds himself faced with an alien threat.Don't expect anything groundbreaking or new from the story, but it serves it's purpose.The characters you meet are kinda clichee/flat, but the dialogue is good enough to keep you going.Apart from doing the main quest, you can do in between whatever you like. Trading, fighting off pirates, doing escort missions, mining asteroids for ore etc. pp.You''ll earn money from doing so, which you can invest in a new spaceship and equipment. There are quite a lot of ships to choose from, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. More cargo, better hull, more slots for primary weapons...Depending on how man equipment slots you have, you can choose to install mining lasers to mine asteroids, getting different sized cabins to transport passengers, getting a shield, a cloaking device etc pp.There is also the possibility to buy trading goods and sell them somewhere else for a higher price. Though the economy isn't really complex or deep in any way.The main storyline isn't very long and also the systems/sectors aren't that big, they basically consist of an asteroid field, a space-station and a jumpgate.So, if you don't mind a rather small space, repetition in quests after a while (to get money) and a relatively short main storyline, this might be for you if you liked Freelancer, Starlancer and similar games.

												For reasons i can't begin to fathom, this game seems to be a popular target for bashing... largely by people who have either never played it or only played for a few minutes. It may not be as complex as the X series of games, but personally i think that is one of many plus points about this title.This game essentially plays as a slightly dumbed down version of the classic Freelancer, and is every bit as enjoyable as the title that clearly influenced the design. So, it's easy to pick up and start playing, plus it has an engrossing storyline which it also allows you to follow at your own pace (so you can put the story on hold while you raise enough cash to buy yourself a much better ship and/or better equipment and armaments, for example).Visually the game is very pleasing, even though there are occasionally some very serious jaggied lines in clear view no matter how much anti-aliasing you're using. I run the game with 8x AA and 16x AF and yet they are still quite prominent, especially on the space stations. Incidentally, in the game configuration application it has the option to run 16x anti-aliasing but this option is always greyed out and i've never been able to select it... nor do i know anyone who has, no matter what graphics card they are using. This is one of only two negative points. The other is that stability could be improved. I've only had the game crash twice, but it is annoying when it happens during a mission and you need to start it from the beginning again.The console versions of this game may have additional DLC which will not be coming to the PC version, and yes that is a shame that we won't be getting it, but don't let that sway you from buying it. The core game itself is extremely good and well worth buying, especially at the low price it's currently on sale for.			"

												First of all, yeah it's a great game but there's no Addons nor update patches for PC and for Mac it's slightly more upto date, this game would be so much more fun with atleast all the good patches, Addons on the other hand is kind of understandable that they might be hard to port but come on atleast give us Kaamo Station and the update that contains the Auto Complete system and the Dark Angel, I got this game for PC thinking it would be the full game, plus it was hard to play on my tab, saying this the title of the game on PC needs to be changed, it is not the full version, should be 'Galaxy on Fire 2 HD PC Edition' with a disclaimer notice 'No DLC available nor is the game up to date with android devices', really can't be that hard to do something so so simple, as recently said it's a great game, fun, short and easy but after the first 20 hours it's kinda bland, good time killer and shiny, might be useful for stress relief but if you want the full experience bad luck, the devs did the dumbass choice of waiting to see how sales would go on PC before porting Addons and patches, they believe people that have it on their mobile device will go ""OOO freakin' awesome its available for PC lemme buy that!"" but what people are actually doing is ""oo my favourite game is on PC and it's the full version!.. wait it's not the full version and Addons aren't available for pc, ♥♥♥♥ this I'm finding a new game to play"" seriously how much of a dumber decision could you have made?as stated atleast give us Kaamo, and Auto complete, Dark Angel would be nice as well, all you need to do is remove the Mobile updates and keep the gameplay updates then port it to PC.rating: 7.5 / 10 if you like space games rating in general: 4.5 / 10, guys you need to fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												For those that find the X series of games a little intimidating this is probably the game for you.As a big fan of the X series I was looking for a 'Space Fix' as the new X game 'X Rebirth' is very very broken at the moment but I should point out that Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is no where near as in depth as those games so if you are a fan of the X series this game may not fulfill your space sim need.If however you are looking for a more arcade type space sim Galaxy on Fire 2 maybe the game for you.The basics are simple enough..there is a storyline(a short one) and there are various freelance missions you can take at the stations to earn money and buy upgrades for your ship or buy another ship..you can also mine asteroids (an annoying mini game but a cash cow non the less).It's certainly not a perfect game though, maybe it's because it was originally made for the Android/IOS platform and the pc version was an after thought but there are silly bugs and game oddities to contend with..For instance Pirates attack you on sight, regardless of how many 'friendly ships' are attacking pirates at that time the pirates will ignore them and come straight for you..sometimes shooting at you the moment you enter a sector(and before the sector entering animation has even stopped playing).Also some freelance missions have you attack convoys smuggling goods..fair enough..but the escort ships for those convoys may well be a 'friendly' fanction so once you shoot them down your reputation goes down with them and they will all attack you on sight..doesn't seem to make a difference how high your reputation is either with a faction...try to help out in the middle of a pirate attack and it just takes 1 stray 'friendly fire' laser and they all turn against you.The freelance missions are the typical transport goods..deal with some pirates..taxi some people around..there isn't much else to do though they do pay well at higher levels if you are just going for the 'make money' approach.Overall i obviously enjoyed it enough to play for over 40 hours but as I said I was looking for a space fix and was prepared to see past the flaws in this game..if you are looking for an easy introduction to space sims(and I use the term Sim very loosely) then give this a go(when its on sale)..ideally though you would invest 40 hours into X3 Terran Conflict or Albion Prelude for the same style of game..just done a heck of a lot better.

												Galaxy on Fire 2 HD might have the wrong name. Freelancer Lite is what they should have called this game. It sets itself up as the classic fight, trade, explore space simulator but in all categories it falls short of just about every other alternative in the genre out there.Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is a game made for mobile devices and while the graphics are actually impressive from that perspective they do not compare to to even old PC games much as the rest of the game. The limitations of it's original platform are quickly apparent, every star system is exactly the same as the last, everything that can spawn in the game spawns at exactly the same spot every time and the complete and utter lack of any collision detection makes for rather silly combat.Don't let the ""Full HD"" fool you, the graphics are actually worse than Freelancer's which is a fairly old game and the lightning, physics, etc are all well below the 10 year old standards.The problem with making a Freelancer Lite is that when you take out everything but the bare essentials all you're left with is grind. And pure grind, especially if there is no or little reward, is no fun. No fun at all.			"

												I wish I could not recommend this game, I really do.   I loved the game on iOS and have all the DLC and updates and the HD version there.  The PC port is just what it is, a highly disappointing PC port, with no patches, DLC, or support.  All it does is take the original game and put it with better graphics and stability.  And boy, is it good.  This game, especially with the lack of support, and the way the devs have treated the PC version, does not deserve a good review.  But I can't resist.  I love this game, and even with so much missing content (even the Kaamo club is gone), I still love the game.  However,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME AT FULL PRICE!I am serious.  It is not at all worth 20 bucks.  It is worth 5 at most, the same as the iOS HD version.  So, get it on sale, like I did, and you are far less likely to regret your decision.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD is a space-based flight arcade simulation from Fishlabs Entertainment, it is a PC remake of the Galaxy on Fire 2 game on iOS and Android.Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD, in terms on gameplay, it is very similar to the iOS and Android version. You can mine asteroids for resources, fighting pirates, buying and upgrading ships, doing missions like destroying space garbage, defending space station or transporting cargo or people. For a PC game, Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD is too short and very lack of features. It's very fun to play, but there's just not much to do in the game, especially since the DLC wasn't released on PC.Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD graphics are indeed good, but to called it Full HD it's just kinda lying. You may call it false advertising. Other than that, the graphics are good and the performance are great, no lags, frame rate issues and such, the game is playable.Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD is a good game, fun to play, but kinda overpriced, unless the DLC are included with the base game. I recommend this on sale.Rating 6/10			"

												Edit: Updated the review to be much more detailed.GoF 2. I have played the original GoF 1 on Java, GoF 2 on Java, later full HD on android, played all expansions on android, and even play on the GoF online game ""Alliances"". You can safely say I love the series.Do not get me wrong with the downvote. The game itself, is very good, playable, and advanced - for a game that target is mobile gaming. Graphics are beautiful, controls are well designed, you have varied choice of ships (altho, in the core it boils down to freighters/fighters)The story plot is enough to keep you entertained for several hours, interesting, engaging, and even humorous at times. Definetly the title I would recommend to another space sim player.But here, we get started on the reason of the downvote. The developers uploaded the base game to steam and put a price tag on it. That's it. No updates. Players pooled together, asking for release of expansions to the Steam/PC version. Unfortunately the Developer stated that none of this will be ever coming to PC.Save your money here, and go purchase it on your Smartphone store (whatever phone/system you have).There is a bunch of additional content and missions available on the developed mobile version of the game. Of course, you pay for expansions, but myself, I find that they are worth the money.			"

It's a cut down Elite style game with a story that is sufficient for style of game (just don't expect anything special) and lots to buy and upgrade to.  Unfortunately the life of this game is where it falls down.  Without all of the expansions available on the mobile versions (Apple/Android) you soon find yourself at the end of the game with all the upgrades available and a wanting for more.  Disappointingly the expansions are not available so the fun ends there and that is the only reason not to recommend this game.			"

												     Ok.  Let me start by saying this is a visually good and an easy fun game to play.  I originally baught it on sale for around $2 to $5 (US).   Because of the way I play games, usually not straight through, I have put 75+ hours on it by exploring every planet in every solar system available.  By the way, there are around 100+ planets. Galaxy on Fire 2 HD (GoF2) is with out question a good time killer, not very tasking, relaxing game.     So, why the thumbs down?  Well, GoF2 was ported to the PC from the tablet/phone platform.  Personally, that is NOT a problem.  [1] However, the game storyline is VERY SHORT.  It is really easy to complete the story portion quickly.  When the game is done, you can continue to play by wandering aimlessly and doing the same basic odd jobs while jumping across the galaxy, accomplishing nothing. [2] The game is incomplete.  There are DLCs for the game that have more ships and weapons but, the PC platform version is not worth the DEVs time and effort to support.  [3]  This game is NOT worth more than $2.00 (US), in my opinion, if the DEVs are going to abandon it. Reference...  https://steamcommunity.com/app/212010/discussions/0/846941710366069187/     In short (I know, too late!), if you have to buy this for PC, do NOT pay full price.  If this is what the Devs, ""The Fishlab Team"", thinks of its' customers, I highly suggest you rethink buying ANY of their games.  Your money, your call! "

												A fun little arcade space game that has quite a lot of different types of ships and customization. The story and dialog is pretty weak, but there's still enough here for a few hours of fun. While there are side missions, they consist of just a few ""canned"" missions like transport, attack pirates, trading goods, escort, etc. They're a quick way to make money and don't add to the story. There are a few npc's that will sell you charts to ""hidden"" systems or special items.For a game that tends to focus on trading, they didn't make it very intuitive. There's no way to store goods, so you either have to get a ship with LOTS of cargo space, or just sell anything you get right away. There's also no economy map. You can look at the highest\lowest known prices for each item; but prices change a lot, and so you have to constantly check which turns into a click-fest. If they just added an economy map all this could be remedied.AI is mediocre, usually the only challenge is being outnumbered 10-1. Fighting a couple ships at a time usually isn't a challenge once you get some better weapons and items. But watching AI battle each other can be painful.Graphics look decen't, but for some reason the background stars look blurry and washed out. Planets and special fx look really sharp and crisp, overall they get the job done.I'd highly recommend a controller, and to get the game on sale ($20 seems a little steep).5\10			"

												It's good but it is also free on the Apple App store and the Google Play store. So only buy it if you want to play a simple entry level space sim.Pros:*It is REALLY easy to grasp. If you never played a space sim before but were always interested, this is a good way to dip your toes in the genre.*It has a learning curve a 6 year old could grasp.*It's as casual as a space sim can get (this may be a negative for some)Cons:*It's short*It has little to no challenge*Being a good entry level space sim, it is very basic*No cockpit view, so immersion is limited*PriceOverall I'll rate it 7/10. I had a good 10 hours of fun with it on my phone. I'd say wait and see if it goes on sale though. I know you can't really rate a game on price, but you can value it on the principle of price and with $20, you will not get your money's worth when you can get it for free, or an older more in depth space sim for the same price or less.

												It's quite a fun little space sim, that looks and feels nice at first, but I have two major issues with it because if witch I woulnd't recommend it:1. The combat itself is very simplistic and lacks depth/proper dogfighting. Enemies just charge straight at you and it's up to your gear and basic movement to decide the fight. It's obviously the result of this being a mobile port, but it takes away much of the potential fun and makes the game boring pretty fast, especially with side messions seriously lacking in variety and having a very predictable progression curve. 2. The DLC that was released for iOS and gave the game some cool high-end modules and new objectives will never come to PC, making this to some extent an unfinished product. While I had some fun with this game, it's not really worth your time. Especially now, when we have games like Rebel Galaxy and even Starpoint Gemini 2 around, that can offer much deeper experience for similar money.			"

												Gorgeous, fun combat, all the usual space trading fare, lots of upgrades, but the campaign is short and the developer is vocal in their hatred for anything non-Mac, so don't expect the expansions or any support. Still, if you can get it in a bundle, it's worth a couple bucks.			"

GALAXY ON FIRE 2™ FULL HDA casual and light weight space-conflict/exploration that can't hide its roots as a Android/iOS gameRating 5/10The first thing you'll notice about Galaxy on Fire 2 is that as a game developed for tablets and phones it's very easy to pick up and is far less bloated and complex than other recent games in this genre such as the X series.The game is broken down into a main plot that runs alongside freelance missions, open ended trading and mining. The first thing you'll notice is how easy it is to control and play, even with a mouse and keyboard it's easy to pick up and master in a matter of minutes. Combat of which there is a lot is rather predictable and shallow, pirates will appear at most hubs and you'll soon find them a minor annoyance rather than a serious challenge. You can be helped by station defence fighters and by hiring wingmen to protect you although even on the hardest difficulty they are rarely needed. You are able to outfit your ship with up to four primary weapons depending on how advanced your ship is and four secondary weapons. Primary weapons constitute a selection of different laser based weapons whilst secondary are rockets and bombs. In order to afford these upgrades you'll need to make money and you can make money quickly, easily and in a number of different ways. Completing missions is the fastest way to make money and these can be picked up from various talking heads in the bars of each space station. However they soon become repetitive and lack depth, you'll be offered a variation of defence missions, clean up missions, escort missions, retrieval and transport missions. The only thing that differs between the missions on offer is the location.The next best way to make money is to trade goods between stations or mine for materials from asteroids from asteroid fields outside each space station. Mining is a mini game of keeping your cursor within a circle whilst it moves erratically as the circle becomes smaller. Once you've mined enough ore you can sell this on for a minor profit. Trading is a simplistic affair as you buy and sell a wide range of goods from station to station.The worst part of the game however is the awful dialogue and amateurish voice acting, another of those occasions where just text instead of bad voice acting would have improved the game. If you can't afford good voice actors it's sometimes best not to have any. The protagonist is Keith T. Maxwell, yes you read that correctly, they named the main character Keith. The name Family Guy mocked as being the ""most unattractive male first name in the English Language"". Not to be outdone by such a terrible character name they follow that up with characters called 'Mkkt Bkkt' and 'Erkkt Uggut'. The plot itself isn't too bad if not clichéd. It centres on a mysterious race called the Voids who are striking at outposts across the Galaxy from wormholes and it's up to Keith to save the day. However the terrible dialogue and voice acting makes you want to avoid it or rush through it and to play the game as an open sandbox world instead.Even with all these criticisms I would however just about recommended the game. It is extremely easy to pick up and looks pretty in places. It also doesn't require a big time investment or more than a few minutes to learn the game mechanics. A lot of people have described it as a poor man's Freelancer which it is but it still enjoyable enough for fans of space-conflict games and there isn't a great choice out there at the moment. Obviously this will change with the upcoming Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen.			"

												Whoever was waiting for the release of the DLCs Valkyre and Supernova will be really dissappointed right now:There won't be and DLC for the PC version of GOF2""Hallo dovahkiin,Due to being a dedicated gamer on my own, I can understand your feeling about Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD on Windows, since I'd like to had the possibility playing the game with the add-ons on my PC as well.Anyway, you should keep in mind that we did just release the original game without any false advertisement or statement on this platform and did never promise that the add-ons will be released as well. Regrettably, I also have to add that you have been purchasing the original game, cause you like to play it on your PC, even though you did know that the add-ons aren't available on Windows.Back to topic, we won't release the add-ons for the Windows version, since a porting of them would be quite more expensive than the game licenses we can sell and/or have been selling in the past. This might be a bitter decision, but it is a business decision we have to do as a independent development studio as well. Of course, We have been thinking about whether it would have been better to offer the add-ons from the start, but we have been coming to the conclusion that we have already reached all interested players for Galaxy on Fire 2 on the PC.Best regards,Sebastian""Source of information: https://forum.fishlabs.net/viewtopic.php?p=61777#p61777Anyways,even without the DLC,Galaxy on Fire 2 was a real pleasure to play with(even through I've played with it's DLCs on bot android and iOS platforms,and it was(and still is) fantastic)			"

AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD Original Release: 2012 Genre Tags: Space Sim; Action; Arcade; Adventure My Overall Grade: B+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 5-11 hours Multiplayer Aspect: None Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Aesthetes; Game atmosphere connoisseurs; Casual gamers REVIEWA very fun and aesthetically pleasing arcade-style space shooter.Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD is a fun little game.  It's not very deep at all, and beating the main game can likely be done in an afternoon or two (but much more if you want to get all achievements).  Furthermore, there are plenty of little missions and variations of things to do which should hold your interest as you play through the game, so it doesn’t grow stale.  Sometimes you have to dogfight in space against various ships, sometimes you have to escort cargo frigates, sometimes you have to smuggle some goods, and sometimes you just need to mine some minerals so you can buy a better ship or weapons.  If you like the idea of flying around the galaxy as a Han Solo-esque character, in various spaceships which you can upgrade and customize, then you will probably enjoy this quaint little game.The gameplay is pretty simple and straightforward at its core, but surprisingly offers a lot of possibilities.  As I mentioned, there is a decent amount of variety to your missions and you also have a decent amount of freedom to choose how you want to progress. It actually is pretty engaging once you get sucked into the thick of it.  And right when the game may start to feel a bit repetitive… poof! you’ve reached the end of the campaign anyway.  Additionally, if you find yourself really into the game, after saving the galaxy you can embark on infinite side-quests of various types in an effort to grow your riches beyond your wildest dreams.What also helps the overall experience is that the graphics and animations are pretty nice.  Anyone who appreciates the aesthetic allure of the vast and vivid void of space will enjoy the scenery and special effects in Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD.  I’m not saying it’s the prettiest game ever, but for a simple arcade game, it looks pretty dang sweet.  Things have come a long, long way since the Wing Commander game I used to play as a kid on my SNES.  Now you can not only enjoy the gameplay, but also immerse yourself in the ambiance of space combat.So Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD is a good game; but it is undoubtedly a simple and relatively short one.  But if it sounds like something you would like, it is worth considering picking this up at a price you feel comfortable with. Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations! "

												GoF2 is an interesting time killer, but only on your phone or tablet. On the PC it falls short in nearly all aspects. OK, you can set high resolutions, but textures and models are still very low quality. Sound? Music - atrocious BGM. Voice - medicore at best, but passable, sometimes even funny. But leave it for a second, because special FX isnt that important when gameplay is great. But its not in this case. Controls are horrible. For example flying is most accurate on mouse. When using joy/gamepad its just too sensitive and its really hard to aim. When drilling - use gamepad (not bad X360 pad support), because its nearly impossible to control it using the keyboard. So you will be forced to use 3 different controllers. Story - nothing special, but it justifies all the shooting and exploring. But when on the phone all that exploration and barter feels like ""a lot of content"" on PC is like a neverending chore, boring and tiring.I could recommend this game only as a bargain bin purchase for 1 buck. In other cases you will feel like ripped off, because the boredom will quickly get to you. But dont get me wrong - its not a bad game. Its just not a good one.			"

												Pros: It's a great-looking game, in a light-hearted style which can be positively silly at times.Cons: It's boring.  The versions released on 'phones have DLC which makes the game tolerable - even fun.  The PC/Steam version does not.  You will not have access to most of the great gear and interesting places you would find on mobiles.  Even that gear which *is* present in shops, though, is not something you will have access to if you follow the paper-thin plot - you will have to grind for many hours to afford it.  Even worse is that there are a few pieces of uberstoff in the game which you can only get by crafting it from blueprints, which you can only get at vanishingly infrequent occasions.Honestly, if this kind of game suits you (it does me), you are more likely to have fun playing Starpoint Gemini 2.  That's what I'll be reverting to for my fix of this kind in future.			"

												No. Just hell no. Let me tell you why.Game is abandoned on PC. There are no updates, every update is only for MAC or other platforms. Game mechanic is awful, you can't change keybinds or mouse sens, so whole gameplay force you to luck-shoot agaist enemies. Maybe after 10 minutes and 10000 bullets 1 will hit enemy. The idea of this game is nice, graphic looks cool, flying is fun. Everything is great, but not this crappy mouse movement that you can't change through options. First fight is totaly hard when your mouse is flying around everything but not the enemy. I was trying to play this game, but it's impossible due high mouse sens that you can't change.			"

												I have found this game to be thoroughly enjoyable. From doing quests, buying new ships, exploring the galaxy, finding or purchasing really neat upgrades, Galaxy on Fire 2 has the whole package. The story seems rather interesting, starting off with a hyperspace malfunction which takes a well known war hero to the other side of the known galaxy, decades into the future. Starting over, in an new corner of space, during a vastly different time, chart your own course and reclaim your identity.			"

												Is this a fun space sim? Yes. Is this game worth $8? Barely.I have to admit that I got a lot of enjoyment out of this title; however, there is a vast amount of things wrong with it. 1.) The story is complete♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Imagine a fantastic science fiction story spread out over twenty-three      chapters. Now imagine that story being cut-down, summarized, and crammed into two chapters,        and you have GOF2.2.) The game also suffers from DarkStar One Syndrome. In that, all of the solar systems are layed out      in the exact same way. So in other words, there's not much exploration to be had here, unlike        Freelancer (cue the angelic choir XD).3.) The dev's don't give two shites about their PC port. The mobile version of the game has DLC, but      the port does not.4.) The music is good but repetitive. There are only a few tracks (eight at the very most, I didn't count),      and they're played over and over, and over, and over, and ov-5.) The dialogue sounds like it was written by a fourteen-year-old. So, while it isn't terrible, it's pretty         cringy at times. Especially the ending cutscene.In conclusion, this is a fun game to pass the time. Just don't expect anything incredible.P.S. - Just what in the godd*mn hell is “Keith time” supposed to mean!?! Were you trying to be sexy!? You're a f*cking            creep!			"

												Play this with a Xbox Controller because it is more fun than playing with mouse & keyboard.Fun and relaxing game.You do not have the targeting circles to tell you where to shoot at to hit the enemy like in the X series, but you will do just fine.You can pick 2/4 factions to be friends with or just be neutral to them all. You get payed more the friendlier you are. The 5th race is a common enemy that raids everybody.Game is well made and did not tax my conputer on high settings.Story-missions are actually quite short. You are expected to do a lot of side-missions to get enough money to buy better gear and ships.I enjoyed the game but it felt like it was cut short. The game works perfectly, there are no bugs and you have a lot of fun fighting and upgrading your ship as you go, but later on you realize that there are not that many weapon choices, not that many ships worth buying and that you run into a lot of repetitive missions.I finished this game in 14 hours with 49/92 achievements done. I owned the 2nd best ship in the game, the 1st best ship was only a little better but mine looked better.If you own the game, have a controller and have a free weekend, it is good fun.			"

												Overall: Unlikable Joe Everydude Spaceman set in a slow paced snore-fest with $h*t controls, bad voice acting and missing DLC. All set to a unimaginative story with game play that felt like a chore. In the year two zillion something whatever you play as a pompous unlikable P**** out to bore the galaxy after being transported, wait for it... 35 years in the future. ahhh! It's not complex enough to be a simulator and not fast paced or fun enough to be anything else. So what is it? Not sure besides a huge waste of time and money. I got it in a Humble Bundle and it's not even worth the install. It was designed for IOS/Android and as many people have said, should of stayed there. The visuals are nice and the music sets a nice mood but the controls are awful, forget trying to play with a game pad chillin on your coach cause you need a keyboard for many menu selections. The voice acting is really bad and the story was hard to get into with such an unlikable lead character. There is a good concept here but it's a poor port that lacks the DLC everyone seems to enjoy from a company that has folded as I understand it. It's not worth your money or time.PROS:-Pretty to look at CONS:-bad controls-painfully slow and boring-no updates -no dlc-unimaginative story -not fun			"

 Galaxy On Fire 2 - Full HD Review === Rating: 6.0 / 10* (see below) - An average space shooter with a bunch of problems === Pros & Cons  + Pros + + Nice graphics remaster, for being a port from a mobile game+ Good variety of equipment, weapons and goods to buy and trade around+ Secret Blueprints and star systems are a nice addition - Cons - - Very unbalanced, even at maximum difficulty the player is ridiculously overpowered- Short, stereotyped and boring main questline- On Windows, the two expansions Valkyrie and Supernova are not available, but are on Mac- Broken economy will get you absurdly rich in a very short time with minimal effort- Side quests are useless in terms of rewards: pirating / mining reward MUCH more in MUCH less time- You cannot destroy space stations- No unique quests, NPCs, dialogues whatsoever apart from main quest, just the same quests all over=== Conclusions Galaxy On Fire 2 HD only has better graphics, but at its core is still a cheap and hastly made mobile game.*I gave this title a sufficent rating because we understand it is a porting from a mobile game, but still even for a mobile game, the quality is pretty sub-par in many fields i mentioned above.No game depth, serious unbalances in gameplay and repetitivity cripple this game, which could be as far as decent, but right now is low-tier mediocre on the verge of just bad. I suggest buying it only for a few dollars if on a good sale, if not, forget it, it's simply not worth it.			"

												Objectively, I must admit that Galaxy on Fire 2 shouldn't really standout from any other game in the genre.  There are games with much more in-depth economy systems, games with more advanced flight simulation, and games with a better storyline.  Like I said, it shouldn't stand out.  But it does, at least for me.Something about this game just does it for me.  The atmosphere is handled so beautifully.  The game has a really immersing vibe, and the way everything comes together into an overall experience is just fantastic.  Particularly when starting a new game, I get really into the look and feel of the whole game.  It also has fantastic graphics and art; the ships have some really cool designs, and the stations have really sexy interiors when you're docked.  There's a lot of nice touches in the presentation as well, like difference in audio when talking to somebody in person vs over radio.From a gameplay standpoint, this game is better viewed as a more casual entry in the space combat/trading genre, but what it does it does well.  If you're a hardcore player, you may want to look elsewhere, but for everyone else this is simply not a game to be missed.			"

												A 3D, mission-based game with open, non-linear space travel, very basic real-time combat and no real exploration.  Initially on iOS, the graphics have been beautifully updated for PC.  Unfortunately, we don't get the DLC that iOS has, which is a shame since the story is so short.Sadly, the game quickly becomes very predictable and repetitive: every system has planets; every planet has an asteroid belt; every planet has a single station; every station has a shop to buy/sell equipment, ships and commodities, as well as a lounge to pick up random missions and buy the occasional rare blueprint or coordinates to a hidden system, which is effectively the same as all the others. There's nothing else of note to discover or explore.You can outfit your ship with weapons, armor, shields, cargo space, tractor beam, cloaking device, afterburner, repair bot, jump drive etc.  With only a few tiers of each, variety is lacking.  Ships are small and underwhelming.  Most content is procedurally generated and travelling gets boring very quickly.  I only recommend this to lovers of space games, and just barely.			"

For example, if you compare this game to ""Freelancer"" which is basically the same game: -You dont see your ship actually flying into a space station, its just like 1km left aaaand youre in the dock.-You can access a jump gate from the side-The space lounge (where you get missions) looks ridiculously ugly, its not people who give you missions, but 2D-...things (youll have to see for yourself)-Planets dont seem to be inhabited, you only get to visit space stations.-The economy seems static to me, prices dont change-Your weapons do not stop firing (no overheat or ""too little energy""), lasers have huge hitboxes -> fights feel unreal and unsatisfyingI bought the game for a 75%-off-5$, but this is still 5$ too much.

												This is a highly enjoyable game.You play as a pilot thrust forward 35 years in time after an accident in his spaceship. You end up in the midst of a war and need to find your own place between 4 warring factions as well as pirates and the Voids, an alien species no one knows much about.This game offers a wide selection of vessels to suit your various needs, you can work in mining, as an escort, a freighter, rescuing politicians, as a merchant, cleaning up garbage and so on and so one.You can also hire other ships to help you out.Each ship is customizable with various slots and there is a tonne of different types of equipments to choose from. Suffice to say you have a lot of stuff to play around with yet it never overwhelms you.The graphics are very nice and the music score fits very well. Controls as decent although could be better but nothing that detracts from the experience.The achievements are both in game and in steam and fill a purpose in-game as every medal you gain you earn more cash from your assignments.The story is also nice to follow along and if you finish it before finishing all the achievements you're free to keep playing on and characters in the game will respond differently to you.All-in-all this is a good game and I recomend it, it will give you 20-25 hours of good gameplay.

												Normally the lenght of the game is very important to me, but I feel like that shouldn't be the case here. Yes, story is incredibly short but very often you will find yourself doing something completely different to your main quest.The game is extremely immersive and well made, the combat is very satisfying and well balanced.Graphics were nice and enjoyable, overall, good expirience.

												I enjoyed this more than I expected to.I enjoy having something to play in a window while I watch Netflix, and I enjoyed doing so with this game.Sure, it may not have the visuals or depth of other genre games on PC, but..The graphics are decent enough, and crisp, if lacking in some level of extra detail.The mechanics are broad if lacking complexity compared to other games, but I find them to be functional.You might find you agree with some of the comments in negative reviews, but I had fun enough that it's a thumbs up for me.

												Glad I got this in a humble bundle instead of paying the ridiculous $20 just for this game. Where to begin? The bad voice acting? The main character constantly demanding a date with a scientist for doing his job? That the final reward for finishing the game is a bra floating in space? The only reason I even played through the whole thing is I'm getting the itch for a decent space game and waiting for Limit Theory to come out. The videos made it look like it was a very simplified version of that genre, and it somewhat is. The best description would be if you had a teenage boy write a script for a Freelancer sequel.Also, if you quickly have more money than you know what to do with and feel like just getting the best gear in the game, good luck. Don't bother looking up anything on it because the PC version is missing half that stuff. That takes this from mediocre to pathetic.			"

												The game is pretty fun in overall run, but the side quests are repetetive and get boring quickly, mining is impossible without a decent drill and the pirate attacks are a major hindrance later in the game because you cant speed up the time when there are enemies in the sector, in which case if there are enemies on the other side of the map you have to lazily fly towards them (Hope you bought yourself a boost). The game seems pretty short to me. I was 8 hours in the game and was about to buy one of the higher tier ships when the game decided it would be a nice idea to hang my pc and eradicate my save files. I honestly don't think the game is worth 20 bucks. Buy it on when it's on sale or something.			"

												Not recommended because it's not the full game and so buyers are well aware this is a ported mobile game that should have stayed mobile. Took me 37 slow and semi-afk hours to collect every single achievement in this game, and most of them are a bit grindy, especially to visit exactly 100 of the game's 100 total stations. I did that while at work, and nobody even noticed I was gaming on my tablet pc (Dell Venue 8 Pro) because it was that uneventful. Of my time playing, a very small percentage of it was spent advancing the plot, and most of it being achievement-conscious and thoroughly visiting every station as I moved around the map and took on select non-story missions as they were offered. My method actually ended up quite well aligning with finishing top-equipment blueprints and having enough money to acquire an end-game hull right when the story completion wrapped up the checklist of gold medals still missing.I played through it all with a mouse. It was doable, but a whole line of ship upgrades, namely -maneuvering thrusters-, were completely useless because they only made it harder to keep the darn ship going where you want it to.Combat amounted to this order of events: Approach an enemy, they are already approaching you. See incoming fire that cannot really be dodged because all the ships you drive are sluggish (they do all have fast pitch/yaw control but are drifty with high inertia and low top speed). When you're close enough to start dishing your weapons out, you do, and the enemy and you neither fail to dodge this first volley. Then you pass by one another, and the enemy never fights back after that because all you have to do is make your 180 degree turn and then keep the enemy on your screen and he'll never get another attack angle on you. Some weapons auto-aim, which is frustrating when they lock on to something other than your intended target, flagging you as a traitor to friendlies. The only way combat in this game becomes hard is when there are potentially over a dozen ships all coming at you this same way.The game has [supposedly] more depth after DLC, better controls, and is generally just more appropriate on the iphone or android as a mobile game.

Product received for free
												Galaxy on Fire 2 ™ Full HD, simulation game with space theme and science fiction. This being developed by Fishlabs Entertainment GmbH and distributed by bitComposer Games, released on 21 August 2012. Galaxy on Fire 2 originates in mobile version which was eventually brought to PC, put in full HD. Google Play Version Unfortunately the game looks like it was ported, for lack of a better expression, only in its base version in which has less stellar systems, planets, ships and bases.His story really gets interesting addressing time travel and its ongoing attempts to show what someone is able to undergo to reach your goal. Unfortunately the course of gambling it ended up tiring and losing its depth, it ended up taking me to become unmotivated to read, finally taking me to skip the dialogues.The battles in the game are fantastic and fun, but there might be battles involving different tactics and not just go out shooting and noted that the differences are only the use or no shield.Soon to control the ship for the second time, you will notice that it is very different from starting with a good delay to reach the goal points. Just then we realized that the game has upgrades system which is working well and equipped items should avail the need of the mission for a better chance of success.Overall the game has about 10 hours of campaign and about 15 hours of secondary missions. Being them:- Destroy certain amount of enemy ships.- Transporting items.- Transporting people.- Mining certain items.Things that caught my attention in particular:- The environment is beautiful, especially the planets.- Evolution system and adaptation of items, which make the player create other tactics to succeed in the mission.- Being open world.GOF 2 can draw attention both for the beautiful world that has, as for his synopsis. However after all, it may be just what really pleases, not that you can not have fun, but it's all so simple and time-consuming that eventually becomes boring because even if you are moving in the story, which will see why functions unlockable, nothing else will change. Its main and secondary missions are interspersed as it basically should do the same things: follow up to a point, autopilot or not finally deliver something or defeat someone and then immediately part to another location, a bit of history and return the beginning of the cycle. It is also surprising that the PC version has less expansion than the mobile version, here it is full HD, however which could save the game even more content, is exactly what is missing. Thus I believe that is not worth it.For similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit  steamified [steamified.com]. Also you're welcome to join in the fun in our Steamified group.			"

												For the price, it is HELLA not worth it. You're basically paying $20 for a game that plays and feels like a game made for a mobile phone, because that's exactly what it is.I got it for a dollar off of HumbleBundle. I will HIGHLY recommend this for a dollar. But I will not recommend it for $1.50.The company that made the game went bankrupt, and there is no PC support. All updates and patches are MAC only.The biggest glaring flaw that you will run into is the fact that you will target lock allies over enemies, meaning that using guided weapons of any kind is worthless.The second biggest flaw is that this game is far FAR too easy. Maybe I've been too spoiled by X Series games, EVE Online, or Evochron Mercenary (All of which, except X Rebirth, I recommend over this game). You will probably beat this game easily without even dying once.Overall, the game is kind of like a single hot passionate night of love with a beautiful woman, only to wake up in the morning and find out that woman was your mother. It is fun and fufilling when you first play it, but then you wake up a few hours in and realize it is nothing but a pile of shame.I'd also like to emphasize that, because the addons aren't available on PC, and never will be, the game is incredibly short, with half it's content, and ships, missing as a result.The developers previously used the excuse ""Sales weren't good enough on PC"". Of course, with a $20 pricetag ($15 more than the mobile phone counterpart), its a wonder why, on top of the fact that most negative reviews about this game stem from the fact that none of the DLC has been, or ever will be ported to PC.I hope this helps anyone looking into this game. There are better space games out there. This is essentially a non-multiplayer version of Star Conflict with worse controls.			"

												Galaxy on Fire... everyone knows mobile verison of this game. It was always one of the best games on old Java phones. But how does it work on PC? In fact, it's weak. Mechanics which worked great on phones, on PC is simply too boring. After short while game becomes very repeatable - just fly to a gate, shoot down everything you can and fly back. And again. And once more. And even one more time. GoF had a lot of potential, but unfortunatelly, it was lost by simply copying game from phones, instead of expanding it to make it fit PC standards. It's good to bring back memories about old java version, but even great fans of it will probably abandon PC version after few missions.			"

												I loved the iOS version for its sleek handling and fantastic graphics, and I was really excited when the PC version went on sale.  That said, when I started playing, while I was yet again mystified by the graphics, the controls for this game were nowhere close to refined enough for actual combat.  There is no way to customize controller input (I used a 360 controller) and the mouse tracking is far too fast for conventional usage.  I had to turn my DPI down to about 400 before I could play properly.  The text was also far too small to read on my sub-1080p monitor.  The ships don’t handle well, the controls are fixed to one uncomfortable mode, and it costs way too much for a game that works better on a cell phone.  Get the mobile version—this one isn’t up to par.I'm also not thrilled with the fact that there is almost no support from the company for the PC verson.  I don't think they've updated since a few months after the release.			"

												Let's clear up the elephant in the room.This is a port of an iOS game. However, the game looks and (mostly) feels like it could have been a PC exclusive. Heck, it's the prettiest game I've seen. The FPS is also really solid, with no problems at max settings.The controls are solid, with a streamlined playstyle that's meant for iOS and transitions well to PC.The story is, well, a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just a load of missions strung together. Nothing too special. Also, Keith's a♥♥♥♥♥♥With that said, the game has a lot of room for simply flying around and enjoying space. The soundtrack really emphasises that. (I speak from my hundreds of hours on the bus playing the iOS version)Sadly, Fishlabs went on to make GoF: Alliance, leaving this game with no DLC on PC (and the DLC is pretty  damn awesome)If you love space flight games, or can get it for cheap, pick it up. If you want to try it, get it on iOS.			"

												FIrst, let me explain my NO recommendation.  It would be hard for me to recommend this game without playing it completely through.  That said, I stopped playing it within the first few hours.  Weeks later I installed it again, to give it a second chance, and again stopped playing it within the first few hours.I, honestly, found the game didn't hold my attention.  I've played games similar to this one and have been extremely drawn in by not only the galaxy but the story content, ""Freelancer"" comes to mind.  That said, this game really didn't have anything for me.  I found the space missions to be somewhat short and rather dull.  The commentary, aka storyline, lost my interest before I even left the first station.  Graphics were a little dated.  Equipment and effects seemed plain and ordinary.  There really wasn't anything to keep my attention.  This game isn't for me.  Note, I said ""for me"".The whole reason I got this game is because it came highly recommended by some Freelancer playing friends of mine, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  Obviously they liked it, which means there are people out there (perhaps you) who will enjoy it as well.  For me, it failed to entertain.I'm not going to recommend it, as I personally didn't enjoy it.  I'd much rather stick to Freelancer, which may be a dated game (so is this one) but is still, in my opinion, at the forefront of the space RPG and has an extensively powerful modding community.			"

												Let me start off saying, this is a really short game... If you let it be. However, after having played for about 5 minutes, I was contacted by a friend on steam who saw what I was playing, and told me to take my time as the game was really short if I just followed the storyline. As it turns out, he was right, and I'm glad I listened, because what I got was a really good experience instead of a mediocre one. The ingame timer says I completed it in 11 hours, 45 minutes, and I'd estimate the main storyline would take about 3 hours or so. That's not to say I was extremely thorough, because there's a lot more systems to see and more expensive ships to buy than what I saw, and purchased, but the game did end rather abruptly, and after it finished there was really little reason to play on (though it's a possibility as it's open ended).Now, the game is probably the closest you'll come to playing freelancer again, and it's not really in the same league at all. This is a much more simple version of the same style of gameplay, but it's not without its charms. The voice acting is appalling, but you quickly learn to just smile at it, and completely disregard it (at least that's how I coped with it).So what makes this game fun? Well, it's one of those sandbox type games, where sure there's a main story, but you don't really care so much, as there are lots of star systems to visit, with even more planets to dock at. Each planet has a space lounge, where you are offered side missions for money, or good/bad deals in terms of merchandise. These missions range from the typical defend this convoy, or destroy the pirates, to scanning out a traitor at the local defense force, and getting shot at by everyone else afterwards until you dock, or transporting goods, or passengers to other systems. It's a good idea to do these missions, as it sets you up with a base currency so that you may buy a better ship with more equipment slots.The real money making doesn't start to roll in until you get a so called Khador drive, which lets you travel to star systems without using a jump gate. This is part of the storyline, and won't take long to get. Once you have that, you're able to sort out what's profitable to sell where, as long as you have been docking at all stations in the system you've visited (it'll give you system name for where it's most profitable to sell a certain item at), but enough about that. Another way entirely to make money is to mine. You do this by outfitting your ship with a drill and getting a scanner, and then just drilling astroids outside the various stations. It comes with a minigame of its own, but it was rather boring, if you ask me, so I didn't really get into it.You also have to be careful who you do missions for, or against, because there are 4 ""friendly"" factions in the game, and they are paired up against each other, so doing missions for the Vossk will decrease your Terran reputation to a point where they will outright shoot at you, and refuse to let you dock unless you bribe the station chief. You can fix this by paying a diplomat which sometimes spawn in space lounges if your rep is low enough, but it'll cost you a pretty penny to do so.The story itself is nothing new. Start out with nothing and find out it's up to you to save the world. There are many different ships to choose from in this game, and they are all different in terms of weapon/equipment slots, armor, the way it handles, and so on. You can outfit you ship with a wide range of modules, including shield, armor, tractor beam, cloak, booster, agility mod, warp drive, passanger cabins, and more. This allows for a great deal of flexibility. The weapons comes in form of primary and secondary. The primary slots are for your autocannons, blasters, lasers, and what have you, and the secondary is reserved for missiles, rockets, or emp bombs to disable enemy ships (this will also allow you to steal their cargo if you have a scanner and tractor beam for example). You'll see combat almost everywhere you go, so some good advice would be to get a shield and an armor mod and equip them on your ship as soon as possible, and go from there.Actually.. I will finish the review off with a couple of things I thought were a great shame. You can't really play this game with a controller. The game allows for it, but this being a iOS port, it wasn't designed for it, and even if you are using a controller, everything ingame will be listed with keyboard commands on the HUD. The keyboard/mouse works well enough, so it's not a big deal, but I thought it was weird. Two expansions were released for the iOS, which supposedly made the game a lot better, and introduced new mechanics (upgrades) and ships to buy along with a new storyline, but that will never make it to the PC. I could ramble on, but I suppose I've written a lot already. Overall I really enjoyed the game, and if you can live with a less than stellar experience, I'd recommend you get the game while discounted, and enjoy the ride. There are a ton of achievements you can chase to keep you busy, and if you want the best ships in the game, you'll be playing for many more hours than I did, so in terms of bang for buck, I certainly got mine.

												For a mobile game, this is very fun, and looks great. Although the description saying that the game has ""10 hours"" of gameplay is a complete lie. The actual story can be done in 3-4 hours, it's earning money to be able to complete a later mission that drags the game out another two or three hours. The arcadey combat is decent if not repetitive as the enemies don't fight with any real tactics, they instead fight with the same pattern over and over again. IE: Charge at you spamming.The voice acting is pretty good, the story is decent (They don't really do a good job on informing you what you missed on the IOS exclusive prequel however). The game is nothing special but it's fun. Keeping in consideration that this is a mobile game I'd give this an 8/10. But taking into perspective that it's on PC, it's just an average 7/10. Nothing you HAVE to play, but it's fun for a bit.			"

												I just love that game! That game was meant to be an App for iOS and Android as far as I know and was converted to the PC. The graphics are great and the HD is well deserved. The Gameplay itself is rly smoothed and it's really easy to fly around. The story itself (you travel through the time, not on purpouse, and got to defeat the 'Void') is fast played and I rly wished it was deeper, e.g. what do the Void want? Why do they rob the other nations etc. Or, Why are same nations in war and others not? They could've made much more out of it, but OK it was meant to be a game for mobiles, so whatever :)After you beat the Storyline you can do sidequests, explore the other systems and mess around farming to get the best ship. Or jsut get all the achivments on Steam!I rly wish they think about converting the AddOns on PC as well... It's kinda sad they gave us only half of the game. I really want the two AddOns. Please. Please..Anyways! Great game, Not sure if worth the 15 bucks, because the story is kinda flat and short and all you can do afterwards is exploring and farming, but if it gets on sale I'd highly recommend it.Fun Game, nice setting and hella fun. 8/10			"

												Like a more Arcadey Freelancer, Galaxy on Fire 2 sets off into space with resource trading, space stations, 3D combat and terrible VOs. So far I'm enjoying the game, it's a lot more fast paced than other large space sims and while that helps to move the game around quickly (You don't have to spend more than a few seconds in an area to hit the station and warp to the next planet) it does leave the game feeling a tad... Small.Controls take a second to get used to but there aren't many of them so you'll learn fast. Features SOME gamepad support but requires the mouse during trading and navagating the stations shops/bars.If you're in the mood for a quick, arcadey space shooter, I can't recommend it higher. If you're looking for something along the scale of Freelancer, I'd look somewhere else.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 is a mobile game ported to the PC, where you take the role of the intergalactic adventurer and war hero Keith T. Maxwell. There are 5 factions within the game 2 of whom you can be friends with or remain netural with all 4 and the 5th faction just attacks everyone. I was fortunate to get this game in a BUNDLEPros+ Glitch free+ The game looks great+ Fairly large, open universe.+ It runs at a solid 60FPS and no waiting times between loading screens+ The voice acting and music are goodCons- Short Campaign- No variety in enemy tactics- No DLC- No Dev supportIn conclusion, can i recommend this game? Yes, 6.5/10. This game is fun and enjoyable but is limited with no future support. WAIT for a special >75% off or get in a bundle.			"

The side quests were fun to do at first until you got used to all of them and they started getting repetitive.  One thing that gave me a rejuvenation boost was how you could find ""other systems"" not on the maps.  Overall a fun game.Rating: 7.7/10			"

												If you love Space Games where you are not overly rushed to perform any action, then Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is for you. GoF2 combines all the best elements of past Space Exploration, Trading, Combatting games into one. The graphics are stunning and will leave you wanting to explore new systems for hours on end.Ship control and firing is done through using your mouse. The system is identical to freelancer in a lot of ways and I find to be the best way. The story mode is engaging and well worth the play. Character voices have been meticulously developed for all of the missions and really fit within the game quite well. You have many options while playing GoF2. You can either do all the story missions, or if you get tired of those, you can go trading, mining ores, doing side missions you can pick up from the Space Lounge which include cargo delivery, pirate hunting and killing, transporting people from one star system to another, and you can even find great deals on rare items being sold at times.Combat is pretty straight forward. Depending on your ship (and there are a great deal of different ships to buy), you can have a number of different types of weapons equipped. Ship movement is handled by moving your mouse. Ship speed is handled by your mouse's wheel scroller and firing primary and secondary weapons are handled with your left and right mouse buttons respectively.The only downside to this game is that there is no online or Co-op multiplayer. It would be great to play with other people around the world and team up in fleet's to go exploring and pillaging deep space. However, having said that, in one way its also good that its not online, simply because if it was, it would more than likely be the standard PVP style that leaves you without the option to opt out of PVP battles which is a trend in online space exploration games.If you love space games, Galaxy on Fire 2 HD is one you should not live without. It is by far the best offline single player space game I have ever played!			"

												If it comes down to a binary choice, I guess I can't really recommend buying this game.  It's a kind of shallow, but easy-to-approach space sim in the same vein as Freelancer, but way, way simplified.  While relatively bug-free, the gameplay is extremely repetitive.  The voice acting isn't awful I suppose, but the script is extremely cheesy and B-movie-esque.  The story is pretty much a cut and paste from Freelancer, without the length, wow-factor or plot twists.The sandbox gameplay is lacking any inspiration and you'll find little reason to continue playing other than you can't currently afford the best ships in the game.To be fair, the game isn't terrible, but I'm kind of past considering that praise.  I can no longer afford to waste time or money on games anymore that don't innovate in some manner.  And being an indie title is no excuse for making a mediocre game.  In fact, the lack of time constraints and publisher pressure should, if anything, improve one's ability to look outside the box and approach even a well-travelled game concept with original ideas.

												I'm sure this game is great for people who insist that poking a six inch touch screen on the bus is gaming, but I'm not one of them. This is a mobile game - the dialogue is cringeworthy, the controls are simplistic etc. I thought Freelancer was disappointing, but it's a hell of a lot better than this. Makes me miss Tachyon...In short: Go ahead and buy it for a mobile device, or if you don't demand much in terms of gameplay or writing. The graphics are surprisingly decent, and I guess it would make an ok introduction to space sims or/and PC gaming. Other than that, this is not a game worth buying for a PC, no matter how low the price. It made me sad.			"

												Initially I picked up this game after watching a few vids, and I thought it ""might be interesting"".  I installed the game, and the ""fun factor"" is a definite 10!  The game has kept me entertained for over 10 hours now, and I have really started getting into this great game...However, I hit a wall today in regards to this game, and hit it hard.  I've been playing the game through Steam on my PC, and on the wiki and other pages I've been hearing all these great things about new systems, ships, upgrades, etc. that you can get with the DLC / expansions.  I rushed out to the Steam Store to buy every expansion I could find - but they aren't here!Apparently, the developer decided it wasn't worth their time or effort to release the DLC / Expansions to the PC version.  Note I said ""PC version"" specifically, because the develeoper has released the DLC to ALL OTHER PLATFORMS (Android, iPhone, and Mac).  I can't even begin to tell you how frustrating that is... There is all this cool content that I could be enjoying, but I can't simply because the developer doesn't want to make them available to the PC players.  This basically sours the game for me.  Yeah, the base game is still fun for a while, but I find myself losing interest now because I know I am missing out on the best new content for the game.  There should be some kind of warning on the Steam version of the game, to the effect of ""This game is no longer bieng updated by the developer"".End Result:  Don't buy the game on PC if you want the full experience and enjoyment of Galaxy on Fire 2.  Like I said, it may be fun at first, but the end result will be disappointing.			"

												Galaxy On Fire 2 is Amazing! You can be a merchant, mercinary, hero. Travel from planet to planet, system to system. Tons of stations to buy and sell from. There is a story but theres a lot off free-will. You can do side missions while traveling to a system for a main mission.You can mine on astroids (Not Very Fun) and you can sell the minerals to nearby stations.You can travel the galaxy defeating pirates and selling parts from their ship to earn money.Different stations have different people in the lounges to get side missions from and you get money rewards for completing them.Buy new ships, weapons, and other stuff for your ship. Buy stuff from one station and sell it to another station with different prices and earn money that way.I got this game in a Humble Bundle, GET IT IF THE DEAL IS STILL GOING. This is a 10$ or 20$ game (cant remember) and getting it for whatever price you want is an amazing deal for this game. One thing that would make this game the best game in the world is if it had multiplayer. Buy This Game Now			"

												Galaxy on fire 2 is a port from mobile games where you are Keith T. Davis a veteran pilot from the war, until one day after fighting some space pirates your engine malfunctions and you end up in a strange part of the universe, and it's your task to find what's going on and where you ended at.The gameplay is very basic, move around, shoot things, set auto pilot to destinations, hold the mining laser on X spot in order to dig minerals, accept missions (transport, kill, tests of skill duels) , and buy newer ships with better weaponry.There's a nice variety of ships to buy, my favourite was the veteran terran, can install 4 main guns, which you have to buy or craft separately between emp, laser or normal ballistic cannons.There's also several ship upgrades, increase cargo size, better handling, turbo speed, armor, shield, auto-repair and probably the best of all the worm hole travel, taking away the need of jumpgates to travel through galaxies.The port is decent, no bugs or crashes in my playthrough, takes about 6 hours to beat on normal, but sadly they didn't port the dlcs, which added a ton of content like newer ships, your own base in a space station and more.

												Beautiful game. I really cannot stress this enough.GOF2 boasts a somewhat repetitive space combat (and asteroid mining) flight game with RPG style diplomacy and specific storyline to keep you hooked.Note that GOF2 opts to avoid any play outside of flight which means any time you land your options will be made in the form of dialogue menus and inventory management screens.Where games like Aquanox and Beyond Space fall flat, GOF2 soars. Perfect controller support, beautiful scenery, and solid handling make this my go to game for space travel.			"

												Oh, about 6 or 7 years ago, there was a mobile game called Galaxy on Fire 2 by Fishlabs. It was more than just awesome. It was the game of the generation. Perfect economy - ore you've mined on the one side of the galaxy will be more expencive on the other. Great space battles and unforgetable places... now on PC.It's not a port. I mean, not entirely. Plot, dialogs and even font(Ahh, nostalgia) are the same. The main improvement is graphics and voice cover. It's all on the decent level, no worries.  And... tht's all that changed. Steam Achievement is just a show-off version of in-game ones. This game... is all that you may want from a PC version of GoF2. If you remember this game, buy this NOW.9.5/10.

												Well to begin with, this game was way ahead of it's time graphic wise. 15$ for a game on a smartphone was a lot back in the day and they kind of fell short on money because the game was so expensive. I do believe this PC port was a last try to save the game but it seems like the game itself is no longer supported. Nonetheless, the game is still worth 20$ as you can easily spend a good 20 hours on this game and still feel the need to continue. The graphics were astonishing for a game back in 2011 and I still believe they are quite amazing in full HD nowadays. The story is easy to pick up and also easy to interrupt to do some side missions or make some money. The trading system while being limited is quite decent and you could easily make some money with it.Overall, this game would be a thousand times better with steam workshop and it would probably give the game a new start.Tl;dr : Buy the game if you enjoy playing space sims without having to spend 30000 hours in a crappy ship or grinding mats all day everyday.

												This game isn't for you if you're a real stickler for space-sim. Tl;Dr: Its a freelancer-like that's worth a play if you can get it on sale, but don't go into it with high expectations of a deep long game.The controls were made for an iOS app, so the whole combay system is 'simplistic' at best and 'hilarious' and worst, but works well for what it is and is not clunky. The enemy ai only has two modes, 1. Fly straight at enemy and fire when in range,  2. when you get close, turn around and fly straight away from the enemy or at a slight angle, turn around when far enough and repeat from the top.On top of that, all the npcs are actually faster than your ship. You have only one speed, and its slower than all npcs except large freighters can move by default. (and even the large freighters are almost as fast as you). The only way to keep up is to use the booster addon you can install to your ship, and its sort of a 5 second speed boost followed by a long wait for another, with inertia absolutely not conserved whatsoever. In combat, actually, npcs will slow down to as fast as the player can move, and then at scripted distances will speed up suddenly to normal speed.The story starts cheesy, gets good, and then ends horribly really quick. That ending, man. It feels like the dev team started with a good concept and got most of the resources and plot done for the first chapter of what was supposed to be a AA game for iOS, and then got bought out and fired and replaced with a team of college students with a 1 month-from-now release deadline.The gameplay as a whole is pretty nice and a good timewaster, but enjoy the random sandboxy stuff you can do and don't dive too quickly into the main missions or you'll find it ending really suddenly (With a pretty terrible ending that also leaves more questions then awnsers).Turrets are absolutely useless. Don't even bother with them. They're all manual, and in order to make them not useless hood ornaments you have to open the interface, press the turret button, and then slowly wheel the turret around while your ship helplessly flys in the direction you left it.Apparently automated turrets were added in an expansion, but the expansions are only purchasable if you have the iOS version of this game, and the devs have clearly stated that they are NOT bringing the two expansions to the pc version EVER because they're ""a mobile gaming company"".

The devs have already stated they are not going to be releasing the DLC on pc, which was the only reason I bought what I refuse to call a game.  I would never recommend this thing to anyone anywhere, it is decent on iOS/android though (also FREE on mobile).  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!Rating 3/10			"

												Game is FUN, but they didn't do as much with it as they could  have, or should have.Blueprints are a bit overly painful to usye. Moneymaking  - mining is the easiest thing to do for cash. Apperantly the DLC isn't available on steam yet, either. I ahve finished the main quest lien, but there's a ton of sidequests to do that aren't really that interesting.  Anyhoo, gonna wait impatiently for the dlc to be piorted to steam, hopefully at a decent price.			"

												So, there I was--- casually perusing the Steam games when I happened upon an old classic from the mid 90s called ""Galaxy on Fire 2TM Full HD""!It looked like a splendid game with stunning graphics for such an oldie and.. what's this?? Voice acting?! My WORD! How did they ever fit all of that onto a few A: discs back then?? It's like Elite but...like..MORE Elite! Wow! And GUNS! You can shoot GUNS! And a space station?! And..and...you can buy things! And when you fly around you actually fly AROUND, like, 3D like! None of that silly business where you look down upon your ship and fire up the screen at a formation of drones but....Okay, look... I'm laying on the sarcasm as hard as possible because somehow this game was actually being sold for actual money. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the ship moves so slow I kept expecting a granny with a walker to float by. ""Combat"" is laughable because the dogfighting is more like watching fish lull around in a tank. I tried crashing into the space station but...no...that didn't help make the game more fun. I guess mining is the cool part because it presents the only challenge in the game. And...um...whatever. This game was released just a couple years ago but I would have pegged it for a couple decades instead.Unless someone can tell me how to unlock ""FUN MODE"" then I'm just going to say that it's a pile of crap.Anyone know how to ""give away"" a game on here? You can have my key. This game is garbage.Like, Boba Fett garbage.Wait, I take it back. That was some sweet garbage floating around with Boba Fett.			"

												This is the most fun open-space sim I have ever played it has a fun storyline & and is really fun to play. This game's DLC'S are fantastic and make this game a lot longer than than just the regular storyline. I feel like this game lacks in the amount of storyline and I wish it was a lot longer than it is. You can't get any DLC'S for the PC version so, I reccomend thatthat if you have an I-Pad, that you buy it on the app store and download the DLC'S from the app store. There may be DKC for the PC version but they are looking at sales right now			"

												Awesome Game, played for many an hour on an iPad. Though be forewarned, the DLC available on iOS is not yet available on the PC so you'll have much more limmited content than the iOS version. This game for me has been very reminiscent of Privateer 2:The Darkening, and a few other good Space Case games. Highly Reccommended, though best experienced with all DLC.			"

												I can't compare the game to Freespace or Freelancer as I haven't played those, but for a touchscreen-based game going to the big times with controller support, this is still pretty good.  And the controls are great, barring that you annoyingly need to use the mouse for shops and menus.  The game is somewhat open-world, though each of the planets has roughly the same features (space station with varying degrees of ""tech level"" which determines what equipment and ships are for sale, asteroid field with different materials, faction ships, pirates, sometimes a pirate space station, etc.), and there isn't much variety for missions (help defend area against pirates, escort large cargo ships, ferry people or materials to area, etc.), and the story is nothing special.  But it's still fun.  You mine asteroids or destroy/disable ships for their cargo to sell to stations for money to buy better ships and equipment, and there's a Skip button for all the story bits if you really want to go that far.  All ships have a number of stats, being how well-armored they are or how many primary weapons you can equip at once, and there is a lot of equipment choices, so there is a lot for customizing and agonizing over which equipment to take this mission.  Combat is fairly basic, with three-dimensional movement, optional boosting, instant braking, throttle control, and strafing, so you won't have anything fancy like somersaults to get behind the enemy, or rolls to deflect enemy fire.  I overall recommend the game if you want a light third-person space shooter game, though I would say buy it only at $10 or so, as $20 without the expansion content the mobile devices have is a bit steep.

												I originally played this through on an iPad, which was surprisingly easy to control, so decided to try it out on the PC. It's still a fun, generic space flight simulator, but doesn't have much replayability value as there is nothing particularly special above other space sims. Definitely doesn't match the nostalgic brilliance of Freelancer. The visuals are as expected for a space sim, with beautiful planetary vistas and nebulae abundant. The game includes all the usual missions (transport, excort, scouting, killing pirates, etc) and the usual features (trading, mining and space battles). It was definitely worth buying playing through at least once if you enjoy space flight simulators, but for me, once was enough. "

												Ok re-write on this review....   The game is nice, graphics are vrery pleasing and the trading and battles are all fun, and there are allot of ships and upgrades you can get as well as alot of gallaxies to explore and trade with. I wouldn't pay 20.00 for it though as it seems the tablet version has ALOT more content. Also there are issues with the  controller support. when exiting a space station or switching in and out of Auto pilot your controller may stop functioning...sometimes temporarilly  (20 sec) sometime you have to restart the game. Also i have had it crash a couple of time right after this has happened. In any case if you can get it for 5.00 like i did it is well worth that price and i am enjoying the game. Again without the support of the DLC's fromt he mobile platform this game is simply not worth full 20.00 price tag. Hope this is helpful!			"

												Oh my god, this game is SO SLOW. Your ship moves at an absolute crawl. I know there are boosters to get later, but two hours of primarily waiting while autopilot drifts forward for minutes is absolutely mind-numbing.Also, the menu controls are terrible. You can't navigate the menu with a controller, so you HAVE to use a mouse, but (at the very least) the mining mini-game is impossible with the mouse, and you're much better off with a controller. There's no one or the other, you're forced to switch between the two constantly, and there's no in-game tutorial for the controller, only a reference map.On top of that, the combat is little more than a game of chicken or chase - you don't move fast enough to evade shots, and your hitbox is gigantic, filling half the screen. Your only option is to try to get behind whoever is shooting at you, ensuring that you will be taking constant damage in battles with more than one other enemy.In short, this game is painfully slow, has a messy interface and the plot is paper-thin. Do yourself a favour and go buy Freelancer instead.			"

												Although the story is relatively short to complete the game (~5-10 hours), I had a lot of fun with this game. Captain your own ship and save the galaxy while taking on missions of your choosing from mining or shipping goods and passengers to taking down space pirates. There are a good number of upgrades for your ship and plenty of ships to choose from so you always feel like you are progressing and saving up to your next purchase, and with lots of planets and star systems with their own stations with different ships and items available at each. The menus and controls are all very intuitive and straightforward so you can get right into the action and easily upgrade along the way.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 Full HD is a simple, but quite enjoyable little space game, offering a spread of different ships with unique characteristics, several primary and secondary weapon styles to choose from each with a progression through different tech levels, mining and trade opportunities and a nice little story.It is far from the length, scope or complexity of say, the X series, but also way more accessible, owned to the fact it is primary developed for mobile OS, like iOS and Android. That also marks the biggest flaw: The mobile variants have expansion packs, DLCs and ingame-shops, all of wich are missing completely from the Steam version, so you really buy half of the game.Another small flaw is the fact that you cannot lock-in a target lock, and also cannot except friendly units from being locked. Add to that the fact friendly targets are far easier to lock (i.e. in a quite bigger radius around the targeting reticle) and the property of any homing projectile to switch instantly to your current lock, and all homing weapons have something of a problem with friendly fire.If you can stand those small flaws though, it is all in all an enjoyable nugget for the casual game in between.

												This is a decent casual game for your tablet.  As a PC game it comes up short and there are better alternatives out there.  The voice acting is just terrible.. I mean, embarrassingly bad.  The combat is slow and frankly boring.  I'm sure this game was great initially as an iOS/tablet game.  On PC, it feels like a space sim stripped of all modern features.  DarkStar One and Freelancer are light-years ahead of this if you're looking for a space sim on the cheap.  Check out X Rebirth if you're looking for next-gen graphics.			"

												Let me first start off by saying I don't like space sims. I like shooters like Mass Effect but give me a game where I'm flying around in space and I tend to lose interest quickly. Whether it be complex controls or anything I'm just not that into space games. That being said I'm surprised I spent as much time as I did in this game. Galaxy on Fire 2 is simple but fun. I can fly around doing random missions. It has everything from shooting down space junk to fighting off pirates. There's partial controller support which helps make things easier. I still had to use my mouse to navigate menus on space stations but I got by flying and fighting using gamepad controls. On that same note I have to mention that the button mapping for controller keys isn't clearly stated so I had to do a little trial and error for things like warping or boost but for the most part buttons and handling movement is simple.Space has it's own economy in which you can scavenge and sell goods in various systems. There's also the option of buying better ships even if the price is steep. Gaining money can be a bit of a grind as the really good high class ships will take hours of doing missions and scavenging to farm the cash needed. In the end I settled for a mid level ship that had decent storage and several equipment slots. So to sum it up, this game is lots of fun. There's a story but it's kind of scarce. I just played around doing missions until I got bored then continued the story. In a way it's a bit more like a side piece. The missions do get difficult later on but the game's map system is good at showing you where your next objective is so you never feel lost or without purpose. Different equipment makes things easier, quicker and more fun and controls are good. As far as space sims go this is one of the better ones and the learning curve isn't difficult if you aren't familiar with the genre.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 on Steam does not have all of contents when Android (or something) version has all of contents.   Despite that,  this game was well worth the fun.   This was very easy getting into it and play for fun.    Learning curve is very low which I enjoyed when in mood of a casual game.This game has difficulty setting you can choose from Easy to Hard.   I went with Easy difficulty and spent 25 hours playing to 100% completed the game.  In a perspective of achievements,  this game can get a bit grindy but that feeling came very late when I only needed several hours to finish off this game.   The story itself is unfortunately very short.   I did not count but probably around 10-15 story missions at most.   That is quite short.   So obviously the aim of this game is not the story but rather immersing yourself in a relatively small galaxy doing side missions to make money here and there.   There is also mining.   Mining was very simple to do in this game, can be difficult or easy depending on Mining equipment you have.  Combat wise,  you will find it similar to some of very simple arcade games you played before.    If you have not play anything like this,  I would take an extra step and tell you that this game will be an ideal game to play.   Again, very simple and easy get into the game.   It should take no more than an hour to get that feeling of this game. Overall,  I enjoyed this game I picked up from a bundle.  I'd rate it between 7 to 7.5 out of 10.			"

												GoF2 Full HD is a good Game, most of the Time i´ve played were spend on the ship i wanted and technology like shields, weapons, extras i used for fighting (hehe)This game has actually a good and decent Story, the controls feel good and easy and mining is also a funny thing if you cant fight other ships good enough!If you finish the game it will run as a endless game and you can do what yu want to do in the Galaxy!Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:Gameplay: 8/10 (it just deosnt feel new or Innovative! but leaves you freedom)Graphics: 9/10 (The graphics are actually good)Support: ?/10 (Never had Support to leave this one out of my Rating for this game)Price: 6/10 (i find 15€ to much wait for a sale)Story: 8/10 (short but good one)Sound: 10/10 (Great Athmosphere. great sounds and effects. well made soundworks!!!)Performance: 10/10 (very stable, no problems on my high end maschine!)FAZIT: 8.5/10 (great game)			"

												After 6 hours of play time everything in the game gets boring and repetitive.Mining Ores is useless too because at almost every time you visit the lounge there are buyers for different commodities. Selling Implants, Collectible Figures, Vossk Organs, you basically just jump from system to system and then you’ll have 300,000+ money. Easy no need to grind ores through mining.The battle too gets boring and repetitive for a while. After obtaining Vossk Ship H'Soc and because it has 2 primary weapon slots; installing Berger Retribution and ReHeat o10 and your ship will overpower almost every ship at this point (6 hours of gameplay).The only problem with this Steam version is the lack of DLCs. No DLC means you will never be able to purchase your own space station which enables you to 'switch' between your ships. Shame after all the hardwork the developers have put in this version.Fun and the planets are nice to look at but it could have been better if the game was designed in PC or console in mind; from what I see the developers designed it as a mobile game which is a shame.

												I want to recommend this, I really do. It's a good game (not great, but fun none the less). Graphics sure ain't 'full hd', they are mildly outdated but okay enough. Story is weak, gameplay is reasonably fun, the customisability of ships is interesting and marketplaces across the galaxy vary, making it fun. Trading can be very profitable as well.Sadly, I found the only true way to get particularly rich is to just turn evil. Really hard to scrounge up the cash other than by being a pirate and raiding lucrative cargo carriers. If you manage to♥♥♥♥♥♥(annoy, since censors dislike the p word) off one of the factions, you can just spend your time in other territory and most of the time if a mission drags you to an enemy faction, you can just speed in and out with minimal damage. Not that I really hate 'evil' play but I wish there was an equal option to be good and still be profitable. Missions stop at in the double digit thousands for rewards, while you can make a million blowing up a human carrier with a particularly good cargo.On top of this, the game is pricey, and the plot short. While you can continue playing after you save the galaxy, it is pretty much pointless. Missions are rarely very risky or even fun once you upgrade, and travelling around deep space can be slow and painful until you get a warp drive.If it was on special, I'd recommend it, but not full price. I think I pulled it out of a humble bundle.			"

												Developers have gone bankrupt so the add-ons the mobiles had won't ever get ported which means a lot of neccessary stuff is gone forever. No mod support at all and being utterly bland and mediocre in everyway means give this a miss at any price. Go play X3 or Rebirth if you want a proper space fighty tradey experience.			"

												This Mobile Ported Arcade Space shooter is allright. The reason I still mark this review as ""not recommendet"" is because the Dev is bankrupt and you will never see the expansionpacks on PC. QQ. Do you remember Darkstar one? It's the same game, except you don't get to fly a superadvanced Alien-Human Hybrid Spacefighter but the same ships eeryone else has. Rest is same. Story? Same. Controls? Same. Gamemechancics? Same.Here are the points where it differs From DS1: - Mining works a little different- DS1 is better polished- Menu works a little worse, as does the interface.- Grabbing Loot in GF2HD is like Grabbing Artifacts in DS1This game is for you if:-You like Arcadespace sims and give a crap about the graphics-You like Arcadespace sims and are broke-You liked the Android/iOS release but want a mouse and keyboard to play-You think X3 is overcomplicated broken §""/& and give a crap about graphics-You are an achivement hunter/♥♥♥♥♥, in which case you will get this game, no mattter how bad it is, as long as it haz achievements.

												In this rather shoddy port of a touch based game, the touch based interface controls are not removed. However when attempting to play it on a touch based device, such as a Dell Venue Pro 8 you can't even initialize the game since it does not recognize touch input. The irony is palpable. Additionally do you enjoy mining in space? Do you like battling overly sensitive control schemes to repetitively mine asteroids for mildly irritating green blobs? If so, this is the game for you! On the up side this game has great voice over work for an indie credit.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 is simple and clean. It takes all the complexities of a deep space sim simplifies it. You can be anything here. If you want to be a trader, you can. If you want to be a mercenary/bounty hunter/outlaw, then go for it. The story gets in the way of the total freedom you can have, but it's still nice as a option. Unfortunately, the game is really short (like 12-15 hours) for a space sim. I was the best fighter in the galaxy after 10 hours, and had too much money from shooting bad guys. Which is okay, if you're like me and prefer to always win. :)			"

												This is not a long game, but is a fun one.  The gameplay feels very smooth and polished, with mechanics that are easy to pick up, if not very complex.  Plays much more like an arcade shooter than a flight sim, which I had mixed feelings about; it will be great if you perfer ""up"" to remain in the same direction in order to hold onto your lunch, but it's a little less satisfying if you're used to other games where you need to make use of roll in order to manuver - you can get by on pitch/yaw alone here.  Provides a solid few hours of casual gameplay fun, though I'd wait for a sale before purchasing.			"

												I love this game, it's an amazing mobile game, and it's the only mobile game I've played so far that still holds up in the PC version.  However, what you see here is a bit of a rip off, the PC version has just slightly less content than the free mobile version (The Kaamo station is missing).  The standard price is $20, 4x the cost of both DLC's on the mobile game (excluding quick access to Kaamo).Currently, if Fishlabs (the devolpers) were to have some sort of massive problem and shut down all work on the PC version, I would go with the mobile version.  However, I don't see these guys pulling something like that, so I'm guessing they're working vigerously to port the DLC's over to us having the DLC's more than tripples the playtime.TLDR:  No, this is not $20 worth right now, but there's more to come and it is worth the sale price of $5			"

However, the lack of DLC does make it not worth the time but all in all I had tons of fun like on the iOS verison. It has many RPG like elements in it which makes you ""Grind"" it out. The story is a little short but the amount of side-missions there is does make it up for the lack of a longer storyline.			"

												Steam, you've got me steaming. You should have made it clear this is NOT the full version. There's no DLC for PC and the best parts of this game are in the add-ons. No Shima System means no Kaamo Club. That means no saving or storing multiple ships and no access at all to the best ships. Buyer beware... This is a crippled port of ONLY part of the game.  There was no indication of that before buying.  On that basis, I give it a thumbs down. But for a properly informed player, I recommend the game as an enjoyable distraction that won't fry your nerves -- and only if you get it at a huge discount.			"

												Nice graphics, for its age. I liked the various cartoon face icons they used for comms channel. It was a nice touch. Also liked that once the story is over, you can actually spend time exploring. Unfortunately, fairly boring and unengaging story. Lots of grinding to get decent gear. The usual ""we don't care if it's a space game, we're going to pretend we never heard of Newtonian physics"", but I'm getting used to the lack of phoques game developers give.It was vaguely amusing. But not great. Still, probably worth $2-$5 or so.Pet peeve: automatic targetting system. If you want to fire a guided weapon at an enemy (say, to not run the risk of hitting a friendly during a furball), you have to let the automatic system lock on. Unfortunately, if there's a friendly anywhere NEAR the enemy, even nowhere near the targetting circle, the system will lock on to the friendly, not the enemy. Even if the friendly is behind the enemy. Which is very annoying.  Also, if you try to use the automatic targetting system to lock onto the station (for docking), it's just as likely to lock onto an asteroid BEHIND the station.Other pet peeve: (slight spoiler)Other pet peeve: if you're anywhere NEAR the freighter, even behind it, when it's going through the worm hole you'll end up pulled in ahead of it and it's game over.

												I am a big fan of sci-fi. However this game  is not as good as I expected it to be. The story is Lackluster at best, but it has a good premise. The gameplay basically boils down to holding down the mousebutton at an enemy with little to no strategy and/or running and failing to dodge. Its got other stuff to do, but really its not the best experience ever. I do not recomend this game on steam, and is probably more acceptable on Android and IOs where a great story is not needed.

												I do not want to be a Sinical ""fanboy"" of the flying zsanra, and its quite hard to find a game, that is good. But hooly Sh**** what are we have here? An another fake simulator?Is it unique? Yes. (1 point)Are we seen something like this? No. (1 point)Is it better on Phone? Yes (-1 Pont)Is that have DLC Content? Yes it does, On Phone/tablet (-2 pont)Is that better to play on PC? You decide, You can try out both, I did. My experiences was from a tablet, and it was way more fun with a frend next to you and playing it togeather, talking abaut it ect, it can realy make a community but its looseing its potentional sadly there is not third galaxy on fire. Yet.So its a Realy, REALY good game, that you Need to give a chanse if you love Space shooting, Ship equipment costumization,And the best part? You are able to do Whanewer you want (+9999 Pont K.O.) So i can only just recommend, thats true its feels kind of empty after you beated the game, but hey, Its always a good thing to try out new things ^^See ya out there, Pilots ^^			"

(i am on a 7850 and can run the game at max setting silky smooth)cons:- terribad control.i'm using logitech F710have no luck getting it to work; tried both direct input and xinput modethe game doesnt even respond to directinput mode, while in xinput mode only the two sticks work but not the buttons.but if you want to use keyboard/mouse, you cant mine, because it's next to impossible to do so with keyboard.- lacking depth (get the X series if you want a good space trader; or strike suit zero if you want space dogfight)- lame dialogues- lackluster music/sound			"

												I originally played this on my Android tablet, and it was a pretty decent game, this version however is a broken mess, no stick support and totally broken gamepad support make it a pain to play especially since the interface isn't really designed for keyboard and mouse control (the original used tilt controls) The UI is also glitchy as hell.  So yeah, if this game looks interesting to you, grab the mobile version, and stay the hell away from this.			"

Red Leader: Red-24, Red-30, follow me!REX: OK! I've always wanted to do this! We're goin' in!Star Tours (1987)I knew that this game is a smartphones-hit conversion. I haven't played it, but reading description and reviews I had high expectations. Maybe not high... but something ;)After 14h+:PROS+ tonz of spaceship's equipment + blueprints+ beautiful cosmic view+ Cloak & Wingmen+ friendly fire onCONS- zero emotions in the main plot- 0.5 emotions in the rest off add-missions- only one add-mission at the same time- weak auto-tracking target and holding in the crowd- lack of better spaceships (for example - I finished the game with the second-third purchase for 300k credits and it was better than ships for more than 1000k o0)- weak and simple 1on1 fights, even at a higher difficulty- AI swarm tactic: bad-guys ignore other enemies and focus only on you- terribly tedious movement between star systems before getting Khador Drive- strange system of races loyalty Subjective rate: C- (I know this conversion, but it was really destroyed the mega-potential of this game... and official price as bonus? 20€? I gave for this game just 1€ and that's fine. 20? We have Legendary STAR WARS X-Wing Bundle for 28€...)So why thumbs up? I still wonder...			"

												ok first of all i bought the game cuz it says full version but its missing storyline 2 an 3 an its missing at least 10 of the best ships (an i mean they awesome!!) and its missing the space station where u can choose to keep your ships that u buy and most importantly its missing all the upgrades u can get for all the ships u buy.I had the complete game on my tablet but my tablet was too slow to play the game properly so i got it on steam hoping that i could finish it but i cant.So anyway this is still a cool game but only about 2 days of playing will get u the best of everything.also for the people who ARE going to get the game if u see vossk organs get them cuz they the rarest product in the game an any dealer who wants them will pay over half a million for 10 tones whitck is at least 50% profit			"

												I'm enjoying the simplicity of this game.  There are some parts of the game that are mediocre such as the graphics, which are dated and a bit glitchy.  The interface is useable, but not that good either, ie control icons on the screen are set too wide apart, which might be ideal for a phone but not for a 32"" screen!  The HD is good, but the graphics are jumpy and fractured at times; I'm running a top end system with a gtx 1080, so I'd expect smooth movement and graphics not tearing of the render on screen.Okay now the good points, the story is very retro (which I love) all-in-all good fun to follow, and has kept me interested.  I wish more games had decent stories....  I like the ships and upgarding system too; these are fairly stock for a game of this genre, but it adds a feeling of customsation, which players of this genre will enjoy.  I can't say I've seen much point in trading so far...  Mining is okay too, but slow going.  The freelance missions will help with your cash flow problems. The really good aspect of this game is the price, it is still a mobile games price.  With a bit more polish on the PC Hud/ UI, a look into the glitchy graphics, I'd give this game based on the cost comparison a 9/10.  As it is I'd say 7/10.  Worth a buy based on the price.			"

												The game is literally dead right now .No DLC for the other 2 campains that the original game had and to finish this game it only takes about 2 to 4 hours . Right now im having trouble finding some end game ships to call it and end this experience on a positive note but i've only been able to grind money and find nothing to spend them on . Overall the game is enjoyable and has good graphics and 60 fps so for a short weekend on a huge discount its a definite deal ( i've got this game for 3 $ ) with a rather light with enjoyable story and fairly easy space fights ( maybe just for me since i was always getting cash and new better low level ships and upgrades for them ) and the freelancer missions always reset so you can do them infinitly ( maybe? ) .As for the 20 $ price tag and lack of content this game doesnt feel like that good of a buy , so would i recommend the game ? definetly on a discount price !

												NOT FINISHED - JUST SAVINGGOF2 was originally an IOS game released in response to rising popularity in it's predecessor GOF. GOF2 proceeded to expand upon GOF1's features and add new ones, attempting to turn the game from a linear space dogfighter into a more 'open' 'explorable' map of different solar systems, where you choose how to progress.Before I proceed, please understand that this game is the vanilla GOF2 ported onto PC with supposedly better but easily ignorable visuals. NO further DLC has been added, nor will it ever be, given the developer's (FishLabs) abhorrent attitude to the PC community.What's the Story?You play as Keith T. Maxwell, a space 'soldier' who is whisked several decades into the future after a malfunction in engaging his hyperspace drive. Keith is now stranded in an unfamiliar section of the universe with no money, no ship (now obsolete and damaged beyond repair).Thankfully he is rescued, and brought to the nearest space station. Here you start with a basic ship and no money. To begin with you must slowly make money by mining asteroids to pay off your saviour. Then you are let loose to follow the storyline of trying to re-assimilate yourself in this new sector of space.You learn of a hostile alien race known as the Voids. They control wormholes between their homeworld and any parts of the universe to attack various other space stations, wreaking havoc and causing distress to all of the resident alien factions. It is up to you, with the help of others, to defeat the Voids and restore peace to the universe.Thus the storyline is linear, predictable and rather boring. If you value this aspect of game design, you have nothing to find here :PWhat's the open-world 'Universe' to discover?The whole 'universe' as such in the game is from Keith's POV a previously uncharted sector of the universe. It consists of 22 Star systems. Each has an un-visitable star surrounded which is surrounded by several un-visitable planets. (all gameplay takes place either in space surrounding the space station or within the space station itself) Orbiting (more like next to) each planet is a space station which one can enter (not seamlessly - loading screens are key) within which various functions may be performed:- Automatic ship-repairs (armour bar fills up - yay)- Automatic Updating of Steam Achievement Progress#- Space Lounge (talk to different people for side objectives)- Hangar (consists of Shop, Ship and Blueprints):- Shop (sell/buy resources, equipment, weaponry)- Ship (equip equipment, weaponry)- Blueprints (build equipment/weaponry by collecting a certain amount of different resources)			"

												I can only recommend this game to people who are  NOT  familiar with these types of games, especially those who know of the existence of Eve:Online, but are too overwhelmed by its depth to actually play it. If you are familiar with the genre  AND  played Eve:Online a decent amount time, then Galaxy on Fire 2 will  NOT  add anything groundbreaking or new to your previous experience and may even disappoint you because of its lack of complexity. tl;dr :  Galaxy on Fire 2 is basically an Eve:""Offline"" with trainingwheels and without the importance of keybindings, less content and depth to get completely lost. Recommended for genre beginner and during a sale. One of the better mobile ports. Where to begin... the cons of course! : - the dialog is cheesy  (some lines are just ... *blergh*)- voiceacting is subpar  (mostly emotionless voiceacting reduced to a simple ""Read the lines and be done with it!"")- the story is cliché ( good guy vs bad guys, good guy saves the galaxy and gets the grill, happy end ) - integration of  the world is only an absolute minimum  (thus 80% of the world stays unexplored)- no motivation to do anything except the main story line  (tasks to keep you busy with low rewards)- no replayability  (even if you farm the very best ship with the very best equipment, the enemys do not scale with you) And now to the pros! : - a splendid port  (pretty textures,FXs and controls)- overall gameplay is acceptable  (aiming is a little off, hitboxes are too big for some objects)- a simpler version of Eve:Online and a good start into the genre  (simple mechanics, mostly explained)- you get your moneys worth of gameplay  (especially when you get this on sale)If you make the decision to purchase this game, finish it and it is to your liking, I'd recommend you test out the trial version of Eve:Online. There you can get a more in depth look at how complex the games of this genre can be. You will be overwhelmed by the sheer amount of information but if you preservere and get the hang of it, you will find joy in this genre. /me shamelessly promotes Eve:Online even though he doesn't play it himself.

												So, there I was--- casually perusing the Steam games when I happened upon an old classic from the mid 90s called ""Galaxy on Fire 2TM Full HD""!It looked like a splendid game with stunning graphics for such an oldie and.. what's this?? Voice acting?! My WORD! How did they ever fit all of that onto a few A: discs back then?? It's like Elite but...like..MORE Elite! Wow! And GUNS! You can shoot GUNS! And a space station?! And..and...you can buy things! And when you fly around you actually fly AROUND, like, 3D like! None of that silly business where you look down upon your ship and fire up the screen at a formation of drones but....Okay, look... I'm laying on the sarcasm as hard as possible because somehow this game was actually being sold for actual money. I'm not sure if anyone else noticed but the ship moves so slow I kept expecting a granny with a walker to float by. ""Combat"" is laughable because the dogfighting is more like watching fish lull around in a tank. I tried crashing into the space station but...no...that didn't help make the game more fun. I guess mining is the cool part because it presents the only challenge in the game. And...um...whatever. This game was released just a couple years ago but I would have pegged it for a couple decades instead.Unless someone can tell me how to unlock ""FUN MODE"" then I'm just going to say that it's a pile of crap.Anyone know how to ""give away"" a game on here? You can have my key. This game is garbage.Like, Boba Fett garbage.Wait, I take it back. That was some sweet garbage floating around with Boba Fett.			"

												Not sure what to write about this game, after a bout 2hrs, i was about to fall asleep. My FIRST impression of the game is that it is a dumbed-down E.V.E. with voice acting - which were pretty good. Outside that, it was very boring. Dull, empty. There was nothing to really hold my attention after the initial game play. what ever FIRE there is - must have been dowsed.			"

												Galaxy on Fire is a Newer and Better Freelancer(2003)I bought all the DLC for this game on my IPod and it was great. Expensive though.I forget if you can change the graphics down or not to the boxier version as seen on the app store.Why dos this game require internet connection to open. I WANT TO PLAY OFFLINE.Is all the DLC in this since the game is $21.99 on the market?I only put this in a bad review, so I could get some attention. So answer the questions and fix em. Other than that, this game is EPIC!			"

												I bought this game a few years ago on one of the good sales Steam has, and it sat and in my que until recently.  And I have to say, sadly, I am dissappointed in the end product.  Game just feels dated and dull.  It just doesn't feel like there's that much to do.  Kill these pirates, mine that rock, get my thing A for money.  I've played games like Rebel Galaxy and it was fantastic, this game just feels like a poor copy.  It's okay, but I just can't really recommend it unless it's super cheap and you don't have anything better to play atm.			"

												A very enjoyable space flight game with an adventure side to it too.  It is not just flying around and killing stuff.  You have to earn credits to upgrade your ship by doing all sorts of different missions like escorting ships, destroying junk in space, mining stuff, etc.  Also in regards to the flying it is not even close to as complicated as other games and that is welcome.  In regards to the graphics for this game let me just say it had me taking screenshot after screenshot because it was so beautiful at times.  I also have to say the story has been fun and the humour in it actually did make me laugh thus far.  After 2 hrs+ of play I know I will be going back to playing this game soon.  I definitely recommend this to others.			"

												It is based on the classic and bombproof ELITE fight & trade & mine & explore & upgrade & save-the-galaxy formula and shares all the good and bad sides of the late followers like Freelancer or Darkstar One. It has pretty visuals and fast engine. In the case of space sims it comes from the technical realisation, there are less polygons to move than in most of other genres so game designers can use the extra processing power on speed and lights that look really good here. Considering that originally it is a mobile game (first I saw it there, it is pectacular on mobos) the HD graphics in the PC version that I played is quite decent too. The overall atmosphere is really nice and space-y LIKE IT SHOULD, you get into the feel in seconds. The ship flies and shoots well, the mouse drive function gives me no desire for attaching my game controller. It is a nice working space fighting engine.Where it lacks is where its buddies Freelancer and Darkstar One do: the content that fills the big space with life. The side missions become repetitive after a while as if there was a big book of space sims with patterns to follow, e.g. you get the missions in the bar the same way as in many space sime games before and the skeleton of the missions share that, too. The beautiful big star system feels to be empty after a while and the main story is rather predictable with no real depth. If you fly by the storyline you can finish the game rather soon.Apart from that, it is an enjoyable space shooter and developers did everything to enhance the experience and reduce unnecessary time burn. The time speedup function is one of the friendliest around and it has the best planetary nav computer programming I've seen so far in any space sim. Due to its mobile origin, flying commands are simplified to the bone and they work pretty fine. Minigames (like asteroid mining) are fun and dialogs have a good sense of humour. Also, the game contains one of the best supporting game character names I've ever seen: Mkkt Bkkt the intergalactic drug dealer whose one single trade can render the whole crew of a space station useless. The name alone sells. All in all it is a fun game that is quite entertaining during the main mission but it doesn't start a revolution. Maybe a space trade sim doesn't need a deep story line like Mass Effect, who knows. As a gamer, I'd just happily see a space sim that changes the almost 30 years old Elite formula more boldly.			"

												Galaxy on Fire 2 is like the X series.  It has a smaller scope, though.  I had a lot of fun with this game, and would recommend it to anyone who doesn't want to put in as many hours with learning the X games.The simpler game is both a good and bad thing.  It was a lot faster to just pick up and play than the X games are.  However, after completing the (short) main story, I felt like I really had done everything fun the game had to offer.  I spent about 45 minutes mining asteroids (while watching star trek TNG on another screen) and was able to buy the best reasonably priced ship, and never needed to buy another.Overall, I recommend it.  I had fun with it.			"

												I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this game. You play as one of the least likeable protagonsts I've seen (Just shut up about your date already), and when out of your spaceship, everything becomes a menu interface. Despite the huge variety of gear to equip your ship with, the gameplay is pretty simplistic. That being said, the way the gameplay and exploration is paced, along with the atmosphere of the game, was enough to keep me invested- and that's a difficult area to impress with. The space travel feels open-ended, involving, and peaceful, while the combat feels tense and dramatic. However, I wouldn't say it's worth $20, so maybe wait for a sale.			"

Admittedly this is really what had me uninstall the game.Other points -The trading was blind, no view of the market etc. Which wasn't terrible, I was fine with it.Summary -Slow moving dumbed down version of Freelancer with very grating voicework. If you're always looking for the next Elite/Starlancer etc. fix then I know if you stick it out that you'll get the game you want, otherwise this game isn't going to convince you to invest the time, I wasn't pulled in on the critical first hour. If I ever see it on a mobile store though I'll buy the mobile version I hear great things.			"

												I've been deeply enjoying this game.  It reminds me of a 3D Escape Velocity with its robust trade system and loose factions.  This game could do with more updates (other than visual ones, which they have done and done well).The story line is very short, completing it in 10 hours with a conciderable amount of that being playing with trade routes (before I got the warp drive).  But for achievement hounds once the story is done you're free to roam and work on those, they provide nearly 100 with varying difficulty (mostly easy).Over all for an indie game this is a real catch, at its $20 price tag I'd try to get it on sale (got my copy for less than a dollar via bundles).

												Ever dream of living in vast emptiness of space? From humble living of mining precious ores, transporting goods or people from one star system to another or clearing space garbage. Jobs too boring for you? Then hunt down pirates, destroy their main base space station, attack convoys from another hostile faction, maybe just cause a mayhem at a space station and be hunted down like a fugitive?These are just some of the missions available for the taking. Sell items from mining ores, get paid for doing missions, equip your spacecraft with a variety of arsenals, from laser, pulse gun, machine gun and heat seeking missiles and more. Upgrade your ships with new armor plating, shields, scanner, thrusters, mining lasers and more! Tired of the same old ship? Then change to a new advanced vessels!For a simple android game that was ported to PC, the RPG element in this game offers an interesting experience that keeps you glued to your seats, doing all those while fighting with the main antagonist faction, an alien race called Void. Befriend or make enemies with all 4 factions, the Terran, Mido, Valkyrie and Vossk. This is simply a great game. Recommended.			"

												Honestly, didn't expect much from this game. Very glad it proved me wrong. As a fan of a ""Privateer"" wing commander series, I was happy to see this game implement a lot of similar features. Though bearing a simple storyline, the gameplay itself is quite good, simple and, above all, enjoyable. If you loved Privateer or Freelancer games, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed by this one.Hovewer, some negative aspects of the game should be noted. Targeting a planet for a jump while in an asteroid belt may prove a pain in the A as crosshair tend to lock nearest asteroid instead of a planet. The biggest dissapointment, of course, is that PC version of this game lacks both DLC's, which are otherwise available on consoles.This game provides several hours of enjoyable gameplay, but considering the PC version I would recommend to hold your money until it's available at a discount (which was the reason I originally bought it).

												Everything is there - it's got a very decent mining mini game, the story is easy to follow if a little cliched, and it looks like there's a pretty good ship upgrade system in place.  The only thing missing is the combat, which is horrid, and is unfortunately the backbone of the game.  Your hitbox extends way out from your ship, meaning that enemies hit you incredibly easily, but they are also incredibly stupid, turning and running from you (allowing you to shoot them from behind) even when they have the distinct advantage.  On top of that, everything moves very slowly, making combat tedious in addition.  I want to like this game, but I just can't.			"

												I feel a little bad for not recommending this game - it's been ported over to PC from mobile, and for a mobile game it's actually very deep. There's no shortage of content in terms of different ships, weapons and commodities to deal with, and the story, while bland, is presented reasonably well.Unfortunately on PC it doesn't play well, though. The combat feels slow and sluggish, and it looks very silly when objects clip through one another, clearly in absence of any collision detection. On higher difficulties the game occasionally spawns hordes of enemies which I could neither defeat nor escape from alive, which felt very cheap indeed.On tablet I could recommend this game, but on PC it's simply outclassed by games like X3 or Freelancer.

												Remember Privateer? THIS! (Think Freelancer with a cartoon narrative.)Not bad--only complaint is that I haven't figured out how to bring up a nav map while, you know, navigating in-flight--lol. And the interface took some getting used-to but it's serviceable... If you liked either of the previously mentioned games--I'd definitely recommend this. =]			"

												Addictive very pretty space game. Suffers unfortunately from lack of complete controller support and tiny text when trying to display on Steam Big Picture TV but otherwise well worth the cost and a lot of fun. IMO it cannot be compared with the X games etc as it is nowhere near as deep or complex. I was a little disappointed that the main mission ended when it did but still played it for over 20 hours just to buy the biggest baddest ship I could. Unfortunately, it flew like a poo-brained cow and I died, but buying it was glorious!			"

												I own this game on andriod, ios, and steam. Absolutly an amazing game...but it is much better on ios. That sounds odd to say, because it has better graphics on steam and android, but it is true because it has the expancion packs. For some crazy reason they dont have these expancions availible on android or steam. When I used an apple device as my daily driver this was my favorite game. After switching to android I see how much that this game was abondoned by the makers on pc and andriod. Long story short, very good game but better on ios if you want more play time.			"

												EDIT: After a lot of thought I had to change my review to a yes. This game is a solid little game despite it's aged/dated feel. There's really nothing WRONG with it that I found in my short time playing it.. so I've got to give it due diligence and give it a yes rating.Would have been baller back in the 90's. Unfortunately, this game (despite being a pretty solid little game) is outclassed in this generation by other space games. Is it a good game? Yes, surely. Can I recommend it? No. It's just not as good as the other space sims out there.I feel a little bad putting a thumbs down, because it really would have been neat a few years ago. But nowadays, it doesn't cut it as far as I'm concerned.			"

												Bad gamepad control.The game tells you which button does what and it simply doesn't do that. - Start/Select button which was supposed to bring menus absurdly control your throttle - right thumb button is supposed to change camera view and it brings a sub weapon menu   (you have to use mouse to choose which one to use in that menu)- left thumb button does nothing but it's supposed to do 'fast forward' when you're in autopilot.You have to take your mouse again to click buttons in the game.There's no way to set the sensitivities of triggers, thumb sticks.

												Not too bad.  Pretty basic space shooter game and I think it would be worth the asking price of $8.  I got it as part of a bundle.  One issue that I did encounter was that the mouse would bug out when anything else became the active window.  So for example if someone messaged me on Google Hangouts I could no longer aim my ship without a restart.  Maybe I'll go back one day and find a work around to fix it as this game was somewhat enjoyable.			"

												Positive:Great Visuals & ability to customize your shipThe game has real potential if make some simple changes in an update – one could even add expansions for this game as you discover new races though various wormholes.Negatives:Travel between planets is way too slow....  in enemy in the system you can't use the Tab key to go faster... so painfully slow and then you have to confirm at every gate and then once again in next system to lock back on your base station (to use FF TAB) , even though I already set my destination on the map (very redundant and annoying to do it over and over again).  They should have a local system of solar system you can go back and forth between where you fight the standard pirates, etc.  However, once you get jump ability you then go to new set of solar system where the enemies is more advance (I am tired of killing hundreds of these pirates – not getting any challenges).  I have 3 lasers as main weapon and lock on missile as 2nd with shield, armor and re-gen bot… seems rather boring after level 6 or so.  One of the missions makes you go across several systems without special drive, and come all the way back… if you get killed, you are going to do the whole mission again (be sure to save at each step). Buy the game on sale , play up to mission 11 and then quit…. At this point you will give a much higher rating to the game , if you continue, the negatives start to take over as you just keep seeing so many pirates that are too easy to kill and just slow down everything you are doing that is already becoming painfully repeatative!

												Fun little shoot 'em up space trader.  I wish the PC version had the DLC, and I understand from the wiki that the company may be in financial trouble so these may not make it to the PC version.  *sigh*  Plus, grrl gamers, be prepared to suspend your feminism yet again -- think of this as a retro 1950s space shooter -- at least, I hope that's what they meant, right?  Because otherwise these guys were so retrocranially inverted about gender issues, they belong with the boys who cheer the dickwolves.  Some of the dialogue is just painful if you are female.The first scientist they rescue is never questioned to be male in any of the pronouns.  Unlike the manly men who fight, he's stammering and skinny.  The second scientist appears -- amazingly she's his boss!  She's beautiful and it's so surprising she has brains and is a looker.  So the hero can't possibly take her into a dangerous situation.  Upon returning from said situation, he refuses to do his next assignment for her (presumably his acting CO at this point?) unless she promises him a date upon his successful return...ow ow ow ow ow...Yeah, it's all supposed to be romantic...or post ironic...or something...I guess?  But game devs?  For women engineers, this is the life we game to escape *from*.  JUST STOP.That aside, a fun little fluffy pew pew trading up gear game for those who like getting podded.  Save early and often if you push it! :)			"

												A great game for all Freelancer Enthusiasts. 10x less pricey than Elite Dangerous. Graphics are colourful instead of ...brown. It is possible to fight pirates right from the start. Travel between planets is even better than Freelancer. Trading is possible, but it's NOT as in Smugglers V - meaning you need pen and paper to make it useful. You only get lowest/max price for a given good. UI is great, simple and useful. Tractor Beams with and without auto-targeting. Steering is arcade and I like that for a Space Sim. Rolling and strifing exists. Difficulty on normal is easy. Many options on ship configuration. Many Goods. Missions are interesting, but not always good explained. There IS a storyline. All in all, if you search for Freelancer 2 - this is it.			"

												I would recommend this game but only on sale. Even though the game has a short ""Main campaign"" the missions and side-quests you can do are pretty fun and time killing. A wide options of ship upgrades are available and ships as well, the space is beautiful and very atmospheric I must say. Despite the offer of side-quests some of them get way too repetitive and it would be nice for some variety added via DLCs that are already available on other platforms. I would like to extend this review by adding a request for modding support becuase if mods were available for this game the amount of visitable galaxies, reputations, upgrades and missions would increase replayability.Overall this game is 7/10. Fun and engaging but lacks content which it desperatly needs to continue it's engagement with the palyer.			"

												Not really a simulation and more of a casual game (but with some difficulty to it.) It takes the boring simulator aspect out of the space trader/combat genre and is more of an open-ended RPG. The main story is pretty much optional (once you get the ability to warp around without using jumpgates) and you can fly around and do whatever. Be a mercenary for hire, a pirate, a do-gooder, ... but keep in mind this is a game that was originally an iOS exclusive. There is indeed lots to do, but it's not terribly deep.			"

Checked the gamepad layout and it showed me all the buttons and what they are supposed to do on the Xbox360 controller (again, F710 is 100% compatible with that), but none of them worked. So I've quite the game and investigated the launcher setup menu - turns out nothing in the controls were bound to the controller, so obviously I tried to do it my self - surprise surprise, only the face buttons are recognised! Can't map my second analog stick, my d-pad or my triggers.So much for ""With fully customizable controls for mouse, keyboard and gamepad"" - it's a lie.			"

												Got this cheap at Gamersgate.com (recommend that site btw) .  Pleasantly surprised. This isn't a perfect space sim. It's sort of like Freelancer (from Microsoft, which I liked a lot) . Anyway, it's a decent game that works well, looks good, and does not need an awesome gaming rig to run well. A game , of the genre, to mess around with whilst you wait for the next release of the more heavy hitters . : )  In any case , worth $10. I think I used points from gamersgate to buy it.   "

												I really like this game engine.  A lot of space sim games are pretty complicated and difficult to get into.  This is simple, and transitions nicely from ipad app to computer.  I wish there were more depth in the storyline, however, as I finished the game in about 5 hours (taking my sweet time.)  If you focused on the story missions alone, you may be able to beat it in about 3.  Oh well, had fun playing it again!			"

												So, you want to know the skinny on GoF2? Here it is.It's a fun game. You will fight a little, you will craft a little, you will do just enough side quests to get the job done. The replay is what you make of it. If you liked the game there are several ships to srive for but once the story is over, the drive ends. I would recomend the game but only to those seeking a light experiance that is about 12 hours. What is 12 hours of game time worth? That is the question that only you can answer. It was fun, but preditable. There is room to grow but the steam game lacks the DLC. If the DLC comes it would be worth the price but catch this on sale. Its a bargin in the 10.00 bin or below. If you funded Everspace, first ... THANKS! If you did so without playing this game first.... wtf time to buy is now!			"

												This game is downright enjoyable. It's somewhat slow-paced, but I find it relaxing and glued to it for hours. I guess getting addicted to a game may be a bad thing thoughI do get somewhat of a Wing Commander Privateer vibe from it. You go on missions, but you can also make some money by mining. I overall like it.I got to around 14 hours before beating it. I did extra missions to upgrade my ship. Overall a good for a budget game			"

												Fun little shoot 'em up space trader.  I wish the PC version had the DLC, and I understand from the wiki that the company may be in financial trouble so these may not make it to the PC version.  *sigh*  Plus, grrl gamers, be prepared to suspend your feminism yet again -- think of this as a retro 1950s space shooter -- at least, I hope that's what they meant, right?  Because otherwise these guys were so retrocranially inverted about gender issues, they belong with the boys who cheer the dickwolves.  Some of the dialogue is just painful if you are female.The first scientist they rescue is never questioned to be male in any of the pronouns.  Unlike the manly men who fight, he's stammering and skinny.  The second scientist appears -- amazingly she's his boss!  She's beautiful and it's so surprising she has brains and is a looker.  So the hero can't possibly take her into a dangerous situation.  Upon returning from said situation, he refuses to do his next assignment for her (presumably his acting CO at this point?) unless she promises him a date upon his successful return...ow ow ow ow ow...Yeah, it's all supposed to be romantic...or post ironic...or something...I guess?  But game devs?  For women engineers, this is the life we game to escape *from*.  JUST STOP.That aside, a fun little fluffy pew pew trading up gear game for those who like getting podded.  Save early and often if you push it! :)			"

												I would recommend this game but only on sale. Even though the game has a short ""Main campaign"" the missions and side-quests you can do are pretty fun and time killing. A wide options of ship upgrades are available and ships as well, the space is beautiful and very atmospheric I must say. Despite the offer of side-quests some of them get way too repetitive and it would be nice for some variety added via DLCs that are already available on other platforms. I would like to extend this review by adding a request for modding support becuase if mods were available for this game the amount of visitable galaxies, reputations, upgrades and missions would increase replayability.Overall this game is 7/10. Fun and engaging but lacks content which it desperatly needs to continue it's engagement with the palyer.			"

												Not really a simulation and more of a casual game (but with some difficulty to it.) It takes the boring simulator aspect out of the space trader/combat genre and is more of an open-ended RPG. The main story is pretty much optional (once you get the ability to warp around without using jumpgates) and you can fly around and do whatever. Be a mercenary for hire, a pirate, a do-gooder, ... but keep in mind this is a game that was originally an iOS exclusive. There is indeed lots to do, but it's not terribly deep.			"

												A great game for all Freelancer Enthusiasts. 10x less pricey than Elite Dangerous. Graphics are colourful instead of ...brown. It is possible to fight pirates right from the start. Travel between planets is even better than Freelancer. Trading is possible, but it's NOT as in Smugglers V - meaning you need pen and paper to make it useful. You only get lowest/max price for a given good. UI is great, simple and useful. Tractor Beams with and without auto-targeting. Steering is arcade and I like that for a Space Sim. Rolling and strifing exists. Difficulty on normal is easy. Many options on ship configuration. Many Goods. Missions are interesting, but not always good explained. There IS a storyline. All in all, if you search for Freelancer 2 - this is it.			"

												Looked better in the videos.It's not a bad game but it's not a PC game. I got this hoping I could relive some old Freelancer memories but, in the end, all I got was a tablet game that tries to be played with an Xbox controller or keyboard + mouse. Controlls are really clunky in my opinion, and that's what drags the game down. You barely have any settings; not to mention that you can't adjust things like sensitivity.I can't recommend a game like this on PC. Get in on a tablet and enjoy!			"

												WARNING: Don't buy this game even on a 90% discount, okay ...now read my rant (I guess) Loved the game, never played it before on any other devices. I bought it on sale on steam (pc) - I'm fairly disappointed to find out fro previous comments that this game did have DLCs on other devices and not pc because the game was abandoned. I reallly enjoyed destroying ships and going through the storyline. But sadly. the story ended after 1hr and I already had the best stuff I could've had besides the 6milll ship which isn't needed, I was using a mid tier ship killing everything ...so yea. game was too short :S looks like the pc version only got 1 mission out of the 13 others on wikia on other devices...which sucks. It's a simulative space shooter game where you build reputation between factions and make enemies to others by destroying their ships for their cargo or doing missions for the counterpart. Sadly, the game ended very shortly for me as I aspected to play ore after completed the void. I do not recomend this for even on its sale value even on a 90% off, I wouldn't just because it wasn't satisfying for the fact it was just abandoned which caused the PC version to only have 1 out of 13 missions.

												Launched the game with Logitech F710 in my hands (100% Xinput/DirectInput compatible), ready to roll, just to find out that all I can do is yawing and pitching. Checked the gamepad layout and it showed me all the buttons and what they are supposed to do on the Xbox360 controller (again, F710 is 100% compatible with that), but none of them worked. So I've quite the game and investigated the launcher setup menu - turns out nothing in the controls were bound to the controller, so obviously I tried to do it my self - surprise surprise, only the face buttons are recognised! Can't map my second analog stick, my d-pad or my triggers.So much for ""With fully customizable controls for mouse, keyboard and gamepad"" - it's a lie.			"

OK, I'll be the first to admit the story seems to be a cheap take on Farscape, but only as far as the first mission. The gameplay is often fast-paced and challenging, and my god that art; that bloody art. I immediately fell in love with the textures and surroundings, and they add so much more to the game, even thought in my opinion it wouldn't need the fantastic graphics to make it perfectly enjoyable.This is one of the first games in a while to make be want to finish whatever else I am doing to play it.Story 6/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 9/10Overall 9/10			"

												Great Game! Very fun to play. There is a story, but it does not force you to go to the next story mission. You can take your time and do as many Freelance missions as you like, upgrade your ship and then do the story based mission as you choose. The whole galaxy is your playground.Anyone who is firmiliar with this type of game should know that in many aspects it is similar to Darkstar One. While the story is different that gameplay, controls, travel, resource collection, and ship upgrade aspect is all similar. If you like Darkstar One you should like GOF2HD. Very fun game. I highly recommend.			"

												Graphics are Nice, dogfighting is fun, voice acting is decent, mission content is crap, and the main mission involves like 40 seconds of flying to jumpgate to jumpgate to jumpgate.It was supposed to be fun, and it IS, until you realize how slow ALL the ships are.. holy crap. I couldn't stand it.7/10 for it's decent graphics and gameplay, but holy crap that 'turtle flying' makes it a 5.1/10.5.1/10, try it out, but you won't enjoy it for more than 3 hours.			"

But keep in mind, it's an indie game, so don't expect big dev company quality. It does look very nice, and has somewhat of the same feel as Freelancer.			"

												Ever dream of living in vast emptiness of space? From humble living of mining precious ores, transporting goods or people from one star system to another or clearing space garbage. Jobs too boring for you? Then hunt down pirates, destroy their main base space station, attack convoys from another hostile faction, maybe just cause a mayhem at a space station and be hunted down like a fugitive?These are just some of the missions available for the taking. Sell items from mining ores, get paid for doing missions, equip your spacecraft with a variety of arsenals, from laser, pulse gun, machine gun and heat seeking missiles and more. Upgrade your ships with new armor plating, shields, scanner, thrusters, mining lasers and more! Tired of the same old ship? Then change to a new advanced vessels!For a simple android game that was ported to PC, the RPG element in this game offers an interesting experience that keeps you glued to your seats, doing all those while fighting with the main antagonist faction, an alien race called Void. Befriend or make enemies with all 4 factions, the Terran, Mido, Valkyrie and Vossk. This is simply a great game. Recommended.			"

												The first thing I noticed about this game is that its aesthetics are incredibly beautiful, and that the game is developed with just a few troublesome bugs involving movement and targeting. Overall, the designed mechanics are exciting and addictive. You choose your own ship, your own weapons, and your own style of play. You even get to choose which factions you want to commit piracy against, which is in fact profitable. Speaking of which, the game economy itself is broad and very much worth exploring.The only downsides I point out in Galaxy on Fire 2 in order to discourage are that the developer has decided not to port the expansions to the game to PC at all and that they have made the game pretty much unmoddable. If you can overcome these disappointments and have fun making things explode, this might just be a good game for you.I would give Galaxy on Fire 2 a rating of 7/10, and it certainly has my approval as a great game to get, but perhaps not for the full price.

												A gorgeous PC port of the iOS classic with really nice Xbox 360 controller compatability (but not for the menus), but sadly a victim of Fishlabs' bizzare business model which has decided to not release the excellent mobile expansions, Valkyrie and Supernova, for the PC citing supposedly ""bad sales.""  Pretty disappointing to someone like me who has paid original price for all the mobile versions.  Many people have pointed out that the iOS version is now free-to-play so you shouldn't play the PC version, but keep in mind the ftp versions now have in-game advertisements.  Still, if you're looking for a sort of Freelancer/Elite ""lite"" kind of game, this is well worth getting into.			"

												For an IOS port this game is truly sollid and one of the better space sims out there that you can just buy and play without having to be concerned about a 1000 and 1 things. If you are thus looking to get into space sims and want to start at a more basic level this game is a really good option for you. For the veterans out there it is still a fun game to play to and I would recomend it to you to.Only down side is the missing content which is found on IOS.			"

												This is an amazing game, if you're into any kind of Space games I'm confident you'll love this one.I'll give a summary of individual features (some opinions);Story - Actually engaging. You want to read everything and listen to the characters voices, it's really well made and you find yourself remembering names and places that in most games you skip through. Not only that, the story is optional, there are some benefits from it that I have experienced so far but nothing says you can't fly off and do what you want.Customisation - You can buy multiple ships with different benefits, some with more weapons, cargo space, equipment slots etc.. Multiple weapons can be equipped, including different types so you can mix and match to suit your playstyle. Equipment slots let you equip enhancements like Shields, Armour, Speed boosts, Mining equipment and more. You can turn your ship into what you want it to be.Freedom - As I said above, nothing stops you from going anywhere, earning Credits(currency) how you please. You can go to safe Systems and mine rocks in comfort, sell them at stations to pure profit. You can buy/sell commodities to and from stations. You can complete side missions for NPCs, involving Pirate killing, transport, selling items to them and many other activities. Or go hunt down enemy factions and take what you want, then sell it off. Much to do!Graphics - I think the graphics are great. The Systems in the game all look spectacular and the Planets are superbly well made. You see the screenshots, I need say no more.Other stuff;Travelling is very well made and navigation help is quite minimal.Scanning / Lock on system is also really cool. No simple button to instant loot, you have to aim your tractor beam at your loot and allow it to fully activate, same with auto navigation, you must lock onto your target before auto navigating. Both can be improved by buying better equipement.There are only very minor niggles for me. Firstly the AI sometimes seems a little lacking, they'll fly right through asteroids and sometimes I have exited a Station inside one. The asteroid generation is also similar, sometimes you get asteroids clipped into the Station / Jump gate. The Auto navigation is also a bit silly, It will fly your ship directly into an asteroid, it doesn't fly around objects. Again not too big of a deal but it could be improved.Overall the game is worth it by far for space sim lovers and anyone alike.			"

												Honestly, I'm suppried by how addictive this game can be, but feel remorse at the same time about how short and unsatisfied this game is. Really, this game could be more.In this game, you control a spacship and feel your life in space. With tons of freelance mission, you could enjoy tons of activities in space in everyday basic, range from mining, trade goods to kill pirate, competing against NPC,... Althought repeatable, and required travel a lot (you can have a breeze later with teleport kind of skill), but it can keep you occupied for sometimes and grind for the best hardware.In space, nice graphic is a must, and fortunately, this game has just that, Those screenshot above is real.Tthe music is lacking, kind of repeate itself, so maybe it will hurt your ear. The main mission is unsatisfied too, it started really good, but end quickly.The gameplay is easy to grasp, it maybe good, or bad, depend on how you like space simulation would be. But I'd say in this game, it's a good thing, 'cause of how short it is.Overall, I give this game a thump up, worth a try, but not worth the price, mind you, try to have it on sale. You can relax for sometimes in this space-sim.			"

												Think I got this game from a bundle or something, so it was utterly out of chance that I installed this little gem and actually played it.First of all, when people say it's easy to grasp, they're not lying at all. If you can w+m1 on TF2, you can do it here with a lot more reward.Pros:- Mostly easy to understand, has a few quirks on how the UI works that it didn't seem to explain such as how buying/selling works. It didn't take long for me to find out though. Simple and therefore mindless to play.- As basic as the environments are, the artistic value of some of the scenes are awesome such as the Void planet.- A lot of ships and upgrades to buy.- New areas to find, even after the main story.- Allows you to take your time with the objectives as long as you don't enter the system your objective is currently based.- Has a basic economy system to allow players to establish their own trade routes to make a profit on goods from system to system.Cons:- No DLC.- Gets repetitive later on after the story aside from unlocking new areas.-  Short storyline, again, without the DLC.- Turrets are mostly useless as they are manually controlled. A turrets moment would probably be as you are docking to a station and have locked your course otherwise you may as well just use your primary weapons.- Blueprint crafting requires you to enter each and every single piece by mashing a button til it hits 70 tons of whatever it is your need to complete the recipie, wasting time rather than just crafting on confirmation once you have the supplies.All in all, I do recommend this game if you're looking for a quick pick up whilst you're waiting for some of the main games of the year to release. It's fun, easy and visually interesting.8/10			"

The gameplay is often fast-paced and challenging, and my god that art; that bloody art.

												Probably worth a 9 or 10 on the iOS scale. Only merits about a 6 on the PC space sim scale.Pretty bland, shallow, and underwhelming when compared to games like Freelancer, X, and Tachyon. Nothing wrong with it mechanically (it plays perfectly naturally using a 360 controller, other than some menus that require using a mouse), but all of the systems look the same, with the same randomly-generated asteroid field, handful of ships, and a single space station. None of them have anything distinctive or memorable about them, and they totally lack the vast feelings of scale in some of the more well known space sims. Main storyline is short, completely by the book, and with no surprises -- thoroughly uninspired in general.The main appeal of the game is for those who enjoy space trading and/or like the feeling of progression in games that let you upgrade your gear. Beyond that, there's not much else to keep playing for.			"

The controls are a little wonky at first - I recommend keyboard & mouse - and I miss the lack of an in-cockpit viewpoint, but the ships, stations, and other objects are beautifully rendered.  The plot isn't the most original ever devised, and the alien races could use a little more fleshing out IMO, but that doesn't detract greatly from my enjoyment of the game.  According to the developer's website, there are 2 addon packs being developed, and I greatly look forward to seeing them released.			"

The pace is much slower than most dogfighters in space, but i like that because those were always too frustrating. This has a very steady pace, and your upgrades let you become a faster dog fighter. The game is essentially your ship, upgrading further and further, flying from planet to planet in search of better items. The story is a suprise most of all, its quite captivating. I highly reccommend this game so far. "

												Ive played hours of this game on my ipad a while ago. the game is great, but very short and with alot of grinding. Wouldnt recommend buying this on PC due to not having any of the DLC options that come with the Ipad version. Really disappointed about that. Other than that its a decent game, but i wont recommend it.			"

												Not really a simulation and more of a casual game (but with some difficulty to it.) It takes the boring simulator aspect out of the space trader/combat genre and is more of an open-ended RPG. The main story is pretty much optional (once you get the ability to warp around without using jumpgates) and you can fly around and do whatever. Be a mercenary for hire, a pirate, a do-gooder, ... but keep in mind this is a game that was originally an iOS exclusive. There is indeed lots to do, but it's not terribly deep.			"

												Enjoying this (4 hours in) fairly smooth experience so far. Easily what I was looking for to scratch my space itch.Very good achievement value, happy with the graphic level from 2012. (2 most important things to me in space games)The skill based mining makes ship upgrades a little more meaningful. Given I can see myself getting sick of mining.So far im happy with the scope and size of the game, will add any negatives later but right now I dont really have any... Well auto pilot ran me into asteroids... and thats about it. So far the missions have been short and stress free, will see how the story plays out.			"

												Not too bad.  Pretty basic space shooter game and I think it would be worth the asking price of $8.  I got it as part of a bundle.  One issue that I did encounter was that the mouse would bug out when anything else became the active window.  So for example if someone messaged me on Google Hangouts I could no longer aim my ship without a restart.  Maybe I'll go back one day and find a work around to fix it as this game was somewhat enjoyable.			"

												TL,DR: An alright Lite spacesim for when you don't have 20 hours to learn a game.It's an alright and simple enough space combat game with a nice enough plot and world, with enough to do to keep you going to the end and enough items to keep you upgrading until then as well. Consider picking this up if the X-series (or similar) seem too daunting, but you'd like something in their vain.			"

												The game itself is actually kinda fun and like a more casual X3-game. Easy enough to pick up but complex enough to be fun and polished to a degree.The problem is the 20$ pricetag versus the few $'s the ipod version costs. You could say ""hey it is in HD!!"", but that doesn't change the fact it is called ""FULL HD"" and then does not even include the dlcs that the iShit version has. So you end up paying 5 times or so more for this version and only receive half the game.The main storyline is only 1-2h long.			"

												GoF2 Full HD is a fairly bad Space-Sim game wich unfortunatly lacks a lot of features.The graphics are fair, the soundtrack and SFX are BAD, the story is faint and very short and the plot just boring.Also, it doesn't come with the Valkyrie and Supernova wich almost triples the story and improves A LOT the action. And it feels like a port.And it is. If you want to play this game do it on your smartphone. You can find it in the iOS Store as well in the [Google Play Store. You can get the DLCs for a fairly small amount of cash and enjoy the game to it's full potential.Rate: 6 / 10			"

												Launched the game with Logitech F710 in my hands (100% Xinput/DirectInput compatible), ready to roll, just to find out that all I can do is yawing and pitching. Checked the gamepad layout and it showed me all the buttons and what they are supposed to do on the Xbox360 controller (again, F710 is 100% compatible with that), but none of them worked. So I've quite the game and investigated the launcher setup menu - turns out nothing in the controls were bound to the controller, so obviously I tried to do it my self - surprise surprise, only the face buttons are recognised! Can't map my second analog stick, my d-pad or my triggers.So much for ""With fully customizable controls for mouse, keyboard and gamepad"" - it's a lie.			"

												A very fun Space shooter along the lines of Freelancer, Privateer, and Elite. This game was orignally designed for mobile platforms(E.G. Android, IOS), however it plays rather well with a keyboard and mouse. Sadly, this game has very little competition, especially for the price range(20USD as of this review). A lot of the game feels like copy/paste. There are only 4 different designs of space stations, you are unable to visit any of the planets. The storyline also comes off as a tad cheesy, especially by modern standards. What it lacks in graphics, storyline, and diversity, it makes up with gameplay and strategy. The player can choose from many different ships, especially later in the game. Some are more maneuverable, some focus on cargo space. Others are little more than weapon platforms. As far as selection of missions and gameplay, GOF2 offers the greatest variety aside from maybe the X series, which has a much steeper learning curve.			"

												Ever dream of living in vast emptiness of space? From humble living of mining precious ores, transporting goods or people from one star system to another or clearing space garbage. Jobs too boring for you? Then hunt down pirates, destroy their main base space station, attack convoys from another hostile faction, maybe just cause a mayhem at a space station and be hunted down like a fugitive?These are just some of the missions available for the taking. Sell items from mining ores, get paid for doing missions, equip your spacecraft with a variety of arsenals, from laser, pulse gun, machine gun and heat seeking missiles and more. Upgrade your ships with new armor plating, shields, scanner, thrusters, mining lasers and more! Tired of the same old ship? Then change to a new advanced vessels!For a simple android game that was ported to PC, the RPG element in this game offers an interesting experience that keeps you glued to your seats, doing all those while fighting with the main antagonist faction, an alien race called Void. Befriend or make enemies with all 4 factions, the Terran, Mido, Valkyrie and Vossk. This is simply a great game. Recommended.			"

I would probably have bought the DLC at that point had it been available, as was still having fun blasting pirates, but.. worth a fiver for a few evenings' entertainment anyway.			"

												Pros: Gorgeous graphics, fun for a while, some decent humor, bras in space.Cons: Music gets boring, you finish the game well before you come near the final badass fighters, DLC is console only. Turrets are manually operated, making them useless.  No point in playing once you win. AI is stupid. When you get close enough, every bad guy ignores everything else and comes after you. (Dur.) Lots of bugs, especially with controls. Had a few missions bug out so I couldn't finish, had to load last save. The final victory felt hollow.It's cheap and if you're hungry for an an okay space flight shooter, go for it. Personally I'd recommended Rebel Galaxy over GOF2.			"

												There's a few problems with this game - the control schema, the arcadey combat - it really could have been more than it is.But for what it is, it's recommendable.Graphics are very nice considering the budget.   It looks good in 4K but the UI scales badly (please fix this).It's hard to tell what you're supposed to be doing in any given mission.It seems like the developers did what they could with the budget they had but still pushed out a well working, well polished game.Overall it's an okay space sim that's been horribly oversimplified by developers who, and this is unusual, actually have enough talent to push the envelope further than they did.  The game shows a lot of talent was put into it and I will watch this developer closely in the hopes they put out a better, more complete, more complex and better polished game.So my thumbs up for this game, while scraping in, is more for the developers potential to do much more.
