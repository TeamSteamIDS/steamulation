												Ahh so much potential. So many bugs. Let me start by saying this is a game that would get a solid 8/10 if the developers had spent just a few more days polishing this off.  Want to scroll around the map with the mouse? Too bad. Like a useful tutorial? Nien. Want to connect two metro lines together? ♥♥♥♥♥ you. Made a mistake about 50k$ ago designing that highway? No Undo. Time to load that save from a million years ago. When Chris Saywer made the ambrosia that is RollerCoaster Tycoon, he understood that you wanted to design a path - AND THEN pay for it. This was figured out in 1999 guys. Scenario goals not working? Let's check google; oh hey some people had the same problem six months ago. No patch, just more shít DLC. Here is the secret to winning for those interested: take out a huge loan and build one really good metro right at the start. Now leave your game on overnight and you can come back and have fun when you have actual cashflow. Cities in Motion 2 is a great sandbox game ruined by seemingly arbitrary design decisions at Paradox Interactive. 5/10 for a nice-looking game that doesn't deliver.			"

												The tutorial in this game is useless, since there's a ton of little annoying things that are not intuitive. But once you know, it works: You have to delete and rebuild roads to get bus lanes. Trams can have tracks on medians and pedestrian paths, and you have to build the tram station appropriately (in the median or on the side of the road). Metros can be built elevated or underground with the page up/page down key (minimum clearance is 8m, which is two page ups/page downs). Building metro track at elevation zero (0 m) will enable your cursor to snap to metro track stubs. Building a metro track/road curve is like using the pen tool in photoshop: you drop a vertex with left click and you undo the last vertex with right click. Waterbuses cannot navigate through/around terrain, so you have to manually waypoint around those. The metro passenger entry point is that tiny ""teleportation box"" that appears on the nearest roadway when you build the station. Tram tracks/Trolley Wires need to be connected through intersections by clicking on the tracks/wires on one side, then clicking on the side you want to connect to. If there's no routable path to the next station, zoom in and inspect the roads for one-way streets and missing intersections. When you delete intersecting roads/metro tracks, the remaining road can still have remnants of an ""intersection"" that makes it count as two roads. That ""intersection"" can be deleted again to turn the road back into a single piece of road/track.If you do play multiplayer, PAUSE THE GAME OR SLOW IT DOWN BEFORE DEMOLISHING ANYTHING, and try not to demolish a lot of things in rapid succession. Don't play it on the fastest speed. If you do desync, have one person share their save file with everyone else and overwrite their local saves, then try to rehost the game.You can adjust the rulesets to do things like make the game speed slower (helpful for big, lagtacular maps) and increase depot size (recommended).Hopefully reading this makes the game playable, since it's pretty fun once you know all the little things. But then again, I was determined to make it work.			"

												After a lot of hours poured into trying to understand and enjoy this game, I just can't.  As much as I love sims and management games, there are too many half-baked ideas and over-simplified systems.- Zoning is a nice idea, but the brush to set zones is massive and impossible to use with any real precision.  The handful of pixels that make up stations, is easily smothered by the massive zoning tool.  And precision can be the difference between a perfectly priced line and a total failure.- Ticket pricing is extremely finicky.  Doing absolutely nothing but letting the simulation run can see costs fluctuate from $1 a ticket, up to $30, and back down to $1.  All over the course of the week, and with no discernable pattern(rush-hours, night time, mid-day, weekend, doesn't matter).  There is no real control, or even logic, to the numbers that are your life-blood.-Side missions should be a good source of additional income to speed up gameplay, but instead lead the player astray and are not helpful at all.  The paths/objectives requested are not lucrative at all and the small rewards do not make up for the costs of the projects requested.  Holding onto ""population increase"" and ""vehicle purchase"" missions can be helpful, but are passive in nature and can be very time consuming.  The point of the game is to build and manage, and to do so well.  Why do side missions work to hinder the core mechanic of the game?- While the game environment will make way for, and adjust to, whatever roads/rail systems you put in place, the control of routing lines, vehicles, and population can be incredibly difficult.  Often it is easier to rebuild the existing road system instead of using what exists.  But even then, the resulting design or plan the player has can be difficult to implement with the cumbersome and demanding pathing/planning system.The game has a lot of good ideas and systems that just aren't fully fleshed out, realized, or functional.  And what you do get is not very well explained, defined, or even remotely consistent.  I did better taking out a massive loan, building two huge subway lines, then letting the game run for hours on end in the background.  Trying to build interconnected systems similar to real world cities only lead to spectacular failures and wasted time.			"

												This game is awesome!  It has a few quirks, and is artificially difficult in ""normal"" mode, but it is still playable, once you learn how to use the Metros.I tend to play it with my own rule set in sandbox mode, and I use that same ruleset in multiplayer mode with a close friend.  As a result, a ""day"" lasts six hours! o.OWe enjoy the game for it's challenge, and yet the relaxed atmosphere and pace.			"

												This game is great fun to play alone and even more fun to play with a friend in coop mode. But: The game is very limited in its options and gets boring and repetitive very soon. Also lots of sync-bugs prevent you from playing the multiplayer properly. I really enjoyed the coop mode, but you always only have a very limited time to play before the game totally craps you up.WARNING: If you play this game in multiplayer over a longer period of time, you'll always get out of sync without any chance to get back. Your coop-partner may build lines but you don't see them and also other important data (like the time of the day, your money, your company value and your weekly income) is totally off for you and your partner. Saving and loading the game again does NOT help to fix this! (Edit: Turns out you can manually end the game, let the host send you the savefile and then load it again to enjoy another few minutes of synced multiplayer gaming until it gets out of sync again. It's still very annoying though, you kinda have to spend half your playing time to manually keep the game synced...)Do I recommend this game? If this was a beta version: Totally yes! Unfortunatelly the options and variety of this game are very limited and it's totally bugged (at least the multiplayer) and there is very little chance that there are any updates still being made to this game, so it's not really worth its price.All in all: Great concept, great ideas, bad implementation.Stay away from this game and eventually hope for a sequel to make a better implementation of this great game concept.

												This is a pretty game, a detailed game, and a game with some interesting and simple innovations like an amazing wealth of charts and graphs that you can really dig into to understand the city you're planning.   Unfortunately, there are enough little quirks that made it difficult enough for me to play that I have to give it the thumbs down.I didn't want to... I WANTED to build cool bus and trolley routes, but half the time my depots just wouldn't connect to the street they were right next to no matter how much I zoomed in and shifted roads around.  I would like to say that building ferries made my city magically accessible, but it was dang hard to find a place where a pier would actually fit, much less a ferry depot, whatever that was called, and the silly ferry drivers couldn't manage to find their own way around a peninusla without a few straight line waypoints.  People digging tunnels for the metro, on the other hand, were somewhat troubled by both straight lines and curves that were too tight... also, it's not clear to me how you can have underground metro stations but a metro line that can't cross under streets.  Or was it just some streets?I dislike writing negative reviews -- I'd give this a middling score if there were options between yes and no -- but I think this game could be made much better with some simple tweaks -- if I want to bulldoze a station, it's OK if I scrap a few vehicles in the mix; or just pop up a window asking me to sell or move them.  Recommend some nice paths for overlapping lines that actually work, or give some tutorials that explain when and how a trolley line and a metro line can cross, because I really just couldn't figure out why some of my intersections were disallowed.Oh well.

												If you liked TTD (Transport Tycoon Deluxe) back in the days, you will most likely like this game as well. The goal is to transport people across a city in multitude of ways. The real challenge comes from efficency and you can really grind down in to the details. You can change the layout of the city by creating new roads (one way, avenues, with or without sidewalks or bus lanes) or you can adjust the individual time tables (frequency, what type of vehicle, times etc.) of busses and other transports.It's a good deal of fun, and the simulation is really good. I can only recommend for those who liked TTD.			"

												This game is great for those of us who enjoy just to manage the transport aspect of a city, and for those of us who love efficiency. The game is not a city builder in the traditional sense--you can build roads and expand your cities around them, but that isn't the primary focus of the game. That being said, there are some pretty serious challenges to the game, and the mechanics as well. I do have several concerns with the game in general, but I'll get to those in a bit. Here's a breakdown:The good: -Seriously challenges you to be efficient-Engine is good-Large variety of possibilites, you can make your own city, workshop is available too-Variety of transportation methods-Building engine is easy to use and coolBad:-Game is DLC-Based-Stops are unrealistic---vehicles leave without being full when people are obviously running to the stop.-Cars are stupid: they do not take advantage of multiple lanes going to the same place.-Height of buildings are not realistic (It maxes out at about 35 stories).-When building new roads, game is prone to developing tons and tons of elementary and high schools, forcing the player to demolish them so houses can be  built.-People are stupid: all vehicles yield to them--ALWAYS.-Traffic lights make no sense-No easy way to make central hubs.-No control over individual lanes in roads.-No right turn on red.-No arrows.All you really need to get money in a game is one good Metro line, then you can just hit fast forward for tons of money.I like the game, but it gets boring and repetitive very quickly. Even with all of the DLC, it's really easy to just fall into the same rut over and over again. The game does a good job for those of us who enjoy city management, however that aspect of the game is fairly half-baked and automated. The content leaves a lot to be desired.I do not reccommend the game to any of my friends.			"

												Love the idea of city-building and management games, especially when transport is involved. But as much as I want to love this game, I simply cannot, because its controls and mechanics are infuriating and extremely frustrating. It is so damn annoying to do anything in this game. After an hour I was convinced that the game is deliberately doing everything the way I don't want it to, from camera movement to adding bus stops to setting schedules to building these damn metro tracks from hell that never go the way you want them to. It's amazing how counter-intuitive the controls are.It is extremely hard to see the roads. Underground view is not really underground view, it's ground view + metro tracks, which makes both roads AND metro tracks impossible to see. Finding your bus stops is even worse, since their tiny transparent icons blend nicely into the background. Conclusion: You can't see anything. It all blends together.Building metro tracks in this game is just the worst thing ever. They never remember or understand the elevation you chose. They don't want to connect to each other. If they do, they do it wrongly. Connecting a track to an underground depot is impossible, since the depot track is under the depot, rendering it invisible, so when you try to connect it, the track decides it now has to surface. After 10 minutes of this farce, I closed the game, promising myself to never play this again.And this could be fixed by a patch. Only that it won't be, because the developers are adding new cosmetic DLC instead of actually fixing the broken game. I'd love to play and like this game, but I can't, because every time I do, it leaves me frustrated and angry at it.			"

												This Game starts to get fun when you figure out how to play. For me, i took a couple of hours alongside some online research to figure out how to play.The tough part in the begginning was figuring out how to connect roads, tram lines, trolley wires. However, turns out it was quite simple. Just click on the trolley line that is already built, & then click on the road ahead that you want to continue building the line.I also had a tough time passing the first Campaign as they wanted 15% coverage, and even with my extensive coverage, i still was around 50% of that 15%. After many hours, I figured that building lines should be 2-Way(I built 1-way), which means that the line must go back and forth to the same stop area(just like a regular public transport train).This game's tutorial could be improved too. I know that the developers are currently unlikely to change it right now, but the tutorial is very 'Wordy', which to many new players may not seem interesting. It lacks ineractivivity as well.Other than these cons, this game still proves to be worthy city builder game.			"

												Great graphics. It's surprising how much you can zoom and watch the little details in the city. Amazing ideas in this game but the execution is very poor in some areas.The average speed of a bus is 1.7km/h (in game hours). That means that timetables are practically useless since your night buses will get back to the depot at 3pm since some 9km lines will take 15 hours to finish. I don't understand what the developers were thinking. Is this supposed to be a simulator or not? Why would anyone use a bus that needs 4 hours to take him from his house to his work? What's the purpose of ""rush hour"" when buses take 1 hour to reach the first stop and then spend another 3 hours picking up people in the morning that want to go to work. I don't know, time in this game makes NO sense at all. It's an insane oversight that simply ruins the game.If you use the custom rules you can set the time to run at 3%-4% of the normal rate which brings it to a real time simulation with buses driving around the city as they would in real life, taking the proper amount of time to reach places, and timetables become again useful. But that way, when you run out of money good luck waiting 5+ hours on your computer (with the high speed setting ON in-game) for an in-game week or so to pass so that you can buy a few more kilometers of metro rail. If we had more levels to the ""high speed"" buttons this ""custom rules"" scheme could actually work.			"

												For those who come from the newer game from the devs, Cities: Skylines wondering what this previous games of theirs is like: In short, CiM2 is [still] the best public transport simulator out there.In Cities: Skylines you get a way bigger map area, better and faster engine, more possibilities for building a city - but its public tr. system is simplified, whereas CiM2 is completely built around that with lots more options.Pros:Schedules: Creation schedules is incredible, you can tailor each line to demand. Also worth setting different lines from a same depot to leave with a delay (e.g. fist buses leaving each line at 4:30,4:35,4:40 respectively, for instance) to avoid queuing, jams, etc on the roads nerby. Don't forget to buy enough vehicles for every depot, for servicing. Don't buy too many either because they won't fit in and just deteriorate over time, waiting on the streets.Street types:: Building roads is incredible, you can curve the range of different types (avenues, one-way streets-bus lanes, and a large combination of these) at any angle and arc, more diversely than in Cities:Skylines.Vehicle parameters: Acceleration, capacity, maintenance cost, fuel consumption, attractiveness.You can choose to invest in attractive vehicles early on to increase usage. You can choose smaller capacity vehicles running more frequently, or big ones running paced out.Finances: You can set driver/reparimen/inspector wages (and nr. of inspectors). The sweet spot for inspectors tends to be 11 credit wages, and an amount so that they catch ~33% of freeloaders. This yields maximum income. The income from inspection nicely balances the loan payment amount usuallyCons:Loans: This is almost like cheat. will have almost unlimited money: You take a huge loan, and set a long nr of installments. It means you can build an infrastructure of metros straight away and guarantee decent income while never actually repaying it (as it may take ~50 in-game weeks or more). Have the decency to work with the 100k starting money, and also don't burn it on metros or trams. Start with buses and replace them later with trams/metros.Campaign: The game jumps you into ""Berlin"", a huge city with a lot of tasks to do. It should start with a small village. Also the campaign scenarios are short, and not really diverse. Custom, free, Steam workshop user-created maps are great to try but offer no missions. Still it's fun to play this game as sandbox, like Cities: Skylines is also, basically.Performance: On larger maps or a large nr. of lines the game likes quite a bit. It is actually caused by the overlay (floating icons for vehicles, stops, lines, depots) which can be turned off but cumbersom (individually).Also it is heavily CPU based, so even an 8-core AMD 8350 struggles on 3x speed (you don't play on 1x usually). When the CPU can't handle more, 3x feels like 1,5x. Not necessarily FPS drop but simulation speed is sluggish.Vehicles: While there is a nice selection of vehicles, there is one ultimate one in each category, meaning I never actually tried most of the buses/trams as they are inferior.Gameplay: While I put some 100+ hours into the game (therefore safe to say it is addictive) it is a grind sometimes. Also can't seem to change the default schedule to something better (2 hour frequency is really bad).AI: The citizens very rarely glitch into circling some vehicle at a crosswalk when too many of them want to cross the road.Road upgrade: Unfortunately, as good and diverse the road types are, you cannot upgrade them, but need to demolish and rebuild.Ticket prices: The game allows you to set ticket prices for vehicle type vs zones, and for single ticket and passes. While this is great to be flexible, it also becomes a grind. Basically a huge table of 6*5*2 cells that you continually need to monitor and update because as you build new lines, demand changes and hence the prices (really complicated system, you will see. The game gives you hints whether a price is below or above the normal. Per cell. With an alert at notification bar every time there is a single cell (ticket combination) that deviates moderately. Ouch.)Stop interest: The circle area of a stop that you place (which attracts only the buildings inside) is a little disappointing. A better solution would be the method in Train Fever where citizens will decide how much they need to walk, and they still choose a stop even if it's far, if it means they still get from A to B faster (that game starts from horse carriages are though).Overall I greatly recommend the game, with its flaws there is still a ton of plus, and is a fantastic simulation for anyone loving traffic, public transportation, or just plain management games! Support a small company :) "

												I am a fan of the first installment of Cities in Motion and did not hesitate to buy number two. I was kind of disappointed. The fun of the real-world cities has been replaced with a big soulless city. I did not really get the hang of the new mechanics, it was a bit more difficult than Cities in Motion 1. If you are expecting the kind of arcade-style game play of Cities in Motion 1 I would not recommend this game. Also what is going on with the prices for the DLC? They are so expensive! If you are like me not a hardcore traffic simulation lover, I would stick with Cities in Motion 1.			"

												What in the world happened here? The original Cities in Motion was a chill little sim that let you fill city streets with buses and trams with just a few clicks. CiM 2 certainly looked like that on the surface, but after just two hours with it I can hardly believe it's from the same developers. I really can't imagine a game that missed the point of its predecessor worse than this one.Cities in Motion 2 places you in charge of a transit company, challenging you to provide public transportation to a bustling city. Starting from scratch, you place stops for buses and trolleys, lay rails for trams and metros, map out routes for your vehicles, and even select the models of vehicle to use. These basic elements allow you to provide service to the many different people of the city, just as the first game did. CiM 2 goes a bit further, though, giving you control of timetables, charging you with building depots for your fleets, and even granting you the power to lay new roads within the growing city.Now, when I say ""growing"" city, that isn't just flowery language. One of the much-touted improvements of this title over the previous is that the cities grow with you. Supposedly your services can influence the growth of the city, and laying your own roads can change the flow of traffic. It's an element of SimCity that feels oddly out of place here, especially after learning to cope with the set traffic patterns of the first game. Similarly the growth mechanic sounds good on paper but has very little obvious effect even after several hours of play.This leads to the core problem with CiM 2, in fact, because it turns out that none of the new additions to the gameplay are actual improvements. The new control options over your company like timetables and service zones make the game more complex without providing any real benefit. It's just another lever you have to get in the right position, and it's not at all obvious how to best set it. Placing depots is another unnecessary distraction, forcing you to put detours in your lines and cram large buildings into the landscape for no actual benefit. And building your own roads can lead to endless frustration because of how touchy the building tool is.I need to spend some extra time on the interface now that I've mentioned it because it is a dumpster fire of issues, especially compared to the clean and simple UI of the first game. Building ANYTHING in this new 3D engine is guaranteed to drive you up the wall as it snaps to the wrong spots or jumps over where you want it or simply fails to connect. For one example, trolley and tram lines can be laid in any lane of any road, and also in medians if available. They have to follow the direction of traffic and must be laid by individual road section, so you have to zoom all the way in and make sure your lines are following the right lanes every step of the way. And if you misclick and need to delete a section of track, half the time you'll misclick again and delete the entire road.Metro tracks became the bane of my existence because of how impossible they are to use. They can't be placed on roads or near buildings, and you have to manually raise and lower them to get them underground or over rivers. Curves that are too tight will break the rails, and rail sections that don't line up perfectly won't connect. The main problem is that the game will happily let you build track that's too steep or too curved for your purposes and then not fully explain why it won't work. Just getting a depot connected to a metro line requires you to manually lay out an entire train yard, usually in far too limited a space.I could go on, so I will. The menus and windows are cramped and difficult to parse. Your charts provide less useful information than the excellent data views of the previous game. Advertising options have been removed for some inexplicable reason. Missions don't properly explain your goals, and this is a big one because the first scenario of the game challenges you to provide 15% coverage of the city, but no matter how much I built and how many people I moved, my progress never rose above 0%. And somehow on top of all this, the game is just harder. After two hours with the very first scenario I couldn't make a single dollar of profit. None of the dozen lines I built, of all shapes and sizes and makeups, would carry more than single-digits of passengers.Everything I loved about Cities in Motion is absent from its sequel. The charm, the accessibility, the convenience, the polish... none of that is to be found here. Somehow it's been replaced with tiresome micro-management, an impossibly bad building interface, vague or non-existent feedback, and the worst part of any sim, trying to cram things into places they won't fit. I seriously can't think of anything positive to say about this one, so I suppose I'll just let my overwhelming disappointment speak for itself.			"

												for reference i also have over 300 hours logged in CiM1CiM2 is a very different feeling game than the original despite an identical premise. It definitely took me a lot longer to get into.Cons: - Steep learning curve. You'll probably fail a few games before you get the hang of identifying profitable routes. - The default game mechanics make it ultimately almost impossible to fully serve a densely populated city. If you expand too quickly you'll start losing reputation *very* quickly as your vehicles get stuck in traffic jams and your stops fill up with unhappy passengers. Buses and trolleys are difficult to use for mass transit; you'll find yourself forced to use trams a lot, or else build your own bus-only roads. - More demanding on hardware even on the lowest settings. I had a fairly decent older computer before this one and the game would overheat the cpu on a regular basis. - Less user friendly in some respects. There's no confirmation before construction or most demolition. Constructed depots and roads take up more space than you would expect and it's easy to cut into the space mapped for city buildings without realizing it, which will cause them to pop out of existence immediately. Save before any renovation projects. - Some of the randomized tasks are either worded very unclearly or programmed in a buggy way. A lot of the connections need to go both ways; unfortunately, Some won't be recognized even if you do that and I can't figure out what's going on. Pros: - CiM 1 was locked to a two-dimensional grid with some canned elevation differences. This game is 100% freeform 3D, with actual hills and valleys and streets curving all over the place. It feels natural, realistic, and alive.  - Higher level of transport simulation. With all your vehicles coming from and returning to depots it feels a lot more realistic. - Individual and monthly ticket pricing, transit zones, etc. lets you control rider customer experience to an unparallelled degree. Vehicles can return to the same stop multiple times in a route or even loop back around the same route if you so choose. The freedom is yours to design exactly the transit system you want. - The financial system is easier to track. Loans are simple to understand and repay; the game quickly informs you if your tickets are far too expensive or cheap in real time; there are graphs for every possible purpose you might want to look at. You can tailor your strategy to the situation seamlessly. - The ability to build your own roads and tramways is *not* to be underestimated. You're not limited by the routes the scenario designer thought you might need. You can bypass high-traffic areas entirely by building a detour. - Campaigns with a more free-form structure than the original. You can very much choose your own path to success. - Game mechanics can be adjusted freely, tailoring the experience to what you want.  But it only works for sandbox and custom games, not the built-in campaigns. - That same feeling of almost zen-like relaxation you can get from the first game is definitely present here. Conclusion: More to wrap your head around than the first game. This one definitely demands more from your mind and your hardware, but it does start to pay dividends eventually. What you'll find here is a very enticing game which offers the freedom to design the transit system you want to run. It's probably not for everyone, but it can definitely be a very enjoyable experience.			"

												You know one of those trainsets you want when you were kids but you didn't get it. This game fixed that for me. but instead of just trains, i get to play around with busses, trams, trolleys, waterbuses, monorails... I don't know.. something about controlling the schedules and watching little simulated people queuing up to enter my ride does it for me.. spent hours of my life trying to build the perfect system.and then it crashes.

												This game has one of the worst tutorials I've ever come across. It leaves the majority of the game completely unexplained, and the parts that it does cover are barely touched upon.  For a game this complex, it's absolutely inexcusable. I know there's a great game here somewhere, but it shouldn't be my job to trawl through guides and videos to learn how to play it properly.  This is basic stuff.			"

												Sure this game is not for everyone, but for me this is a great game. It actually has a very high learning curve and I didn't even enjoy playing it until a long time after buying it(about 30 hours) because its difficult to learn. I'm sure you can find a good tutorial on youtube how to play this. The only downside is multiplayer. Multiplayer tends to lag, and also goes out of sync with you knowing. I would preorder CIM3 no question.			"

												The first Cities in Motion was an interesting enough game, more of a proof of concept than anything else, but it lacked a lot in the long-term game.The changes in Cities in Motion 2 are few, but pointed, and stand as a fairly significant departure from how things were in the first game. For starters, you don’t start in the past and progress through the ages – everything is fixed in the modern era. City maps are also much, much larger, and give a more varied and interesting landscape for you to work around. Cities also evolve dynamically now, instead of via a set progression path – players can plonk down their own roads and access-ways, and houses will spring up around them. The City AI will also react to where you start plonking down transport lines as well, so there’s a very to-and-fro dynamic going on. There are also a lot of minor tweaks, most notably in the management of your company and the lines themselves. Such a departure is not without its consequences though – what Cities in Motions 2 gains in more long-term, large scale gameplay, they lose in short-term, focused gameplay. When presented with your first, large city, it can be quite hard to know where to start.The campaign is largely forgettable, offering up a number of generic, unimaginative missions that you will also get during the sandbox game. In the latter, at least, you can decide to forgo a mission when it bores you, during the campaign you cannot.Much of its appeal lies in its commitment to the day-to-day workings of contemporary fictional cities over Cities in Motion's 100-year timelines for mostly unalterable maps of Berlin, Helsinki, Vienna, and Amsterdam – particularly in the way traffic patterns correspond to a day-and-night cycle and the way you can expect bursty rush hours on Monday mornings and Friday evenings.These additions provide a richer and more realistics experience that extends far beyond mere cosmetics.Yet the new commitment to realism also means that the pacing might seem unbearably slow, even with accelerated time.Cities in Motion 2's more realistic approach may leave it looking a little drabber than its predecessor, but its focus on dynamic cities, timetables, and ticket prices in a contemporary city in real time make it a significant improvement over its predecessor.

												Cities in Motion is a game about transporting people within a single city. You are doing this by building trams, buses, metros and boats. This is in difference to games like Railroad Tycoon, Transport Tycoon and most recently Train Fever where you transport people and goods between cities.The base premise of the game works well with a well executed economy and people having regular destinations and are able to use several different lines to get to those destinations.The game offers a pretty limited set of trams, metro trains, buses and boats. As far as I can make out if you want more you have to buy DLC:s. The game has a campaign that is reasonable and also acts as a tutorial. It is not very special though.Although it is possible to build a profitable tram network, if you want to make as much money as possible, it is almost always best to borrow money to build a couple of metro lines, which will make you enough money to build more metro lines. This makes the game a little bit more boring since not all options are viable.The ingame time is something pretty confusing, since all lines take strange amount of time. It is easy to build 12 hour lines even in quite small city. And passengers are often quite happy to go to work in lines that take several hours. It leaves the impression that people in these cities are spending all of their time transporting themselves. "

												I enjoyed the first Cities in Motion and completed 100% of the achievements and campaigns.   CIM2 retains some of the themes but rearchitects the engine and simulation.  I eagerly picked it up, played through a little bit, enjoyed what I saw but found some of the controls difficult and frustrating, so it languished for awhile. Then I started reading all of the excitement about Cities: Skylines in its prerelease phase, saw the simularities in the look and feel of C:S, and thought I'd take another look.  Applying myself a little more, I found I was able to overcome some (but not all) of the frustration with the user interface of CIM2 and in belated retrospect, it is a very enjoyable simulation.  I'm planning to finish the campaign (and in a sale, maybe pick up some DLC) before moving on to Cities:Skylines, which I fully expect to build and expand on the CIM2 experience.			"

												CIM2 is a wonderful simulator game where you can set up your very own public transport business. The graphics are well done, the timetable system is decent and the fact that you can build extra ""bus-only"" roads is very interesting. However, the online mode needs some work; you can't see the others' view in Coop, so there's no way of telling what someone is talking about. Also, the passengers and the traffic are not sync'ed, so where one player sees a huge traffic jam, the other might see an empty street. The game is still very good and for fans of tycoon games, it's worth it. Just be ready to deal with some minor issues.			"

												My motivation:I love the idea of building an elaborate network of mass transit for a dynamic and growing city, identifying traffic bottlenecks, and solving them with unique interchanges and scheduling. I read the rather mixed reviews, but still felt that there was enough potential upside to buy the game on sale and dig in! The good:I enjoyed the graphics, and the nice mix of transit options. The initial menus were intuitive and I was excited to see a variety of of different 'road/track' and 'station/depot' types listed. The multiplayer option was also a big draw, and I was looking forward to trying this with friends.The bad:Almost my entire time spent in game was me attempting to build a metro. A single functioning metro. One line. ""Not enough space,"" ""Too sharp of a turn,"" ""Track too long,"" Track too short.""I soon realized that the risk of suffering a rage stroke during what was supposed to be my leisure time was just too high to continue playing and that I was never going to invite my friends to go through the same punishing game flaws.On the plus side, I don't think I have ever used that many swear words in a day.

												15/3 Edit:Just my opinion:DO NOT BUY THE NEW DLC: EUROPEAN CITIESunless you're a map maker. Trust me, they are not worth for 12.99 USDBuy it when you win the lottery or when it is -50% or you like these mapsI would recommend you to buy the Monorails DLC than this DLC==================================================This game is great (7/10)As a fan of CiM1 and CiM2This 2nd version of CiM is not so bad, it's pretty goodCompared to 1st version of CiM:- The graphic is better- The viewing angle is more convenient than CiM1- The buildings are more spectacular- A bigger city- A deposit and timetable makes everything more realistic- Day-and-night design wouldn't make your city very strange- A more flexible metro run-way design, not a corner again- Don't need to make the metro to ground to cross any seas anymore- It's very good for a rule-set designer, so we don't need to use the mod- Finally, a multiplayer mode- Defining the mapzone will increase the income of the player, which is a good pointHowever, there are some drawbacks:- The difficulty of the game has decreased, you can feel that after playing CiM1- If you build the support of the track for metro on top of the road, they will disappear, how terrible it is D:- Because of a better graphic, this game needs a LOT of RAM to run it- It crashed frequently if I run any map which has a lot of trees or buildings (Inculding the official map: Central City)- The tutorial of this game is SUCKS, just giving you tons of word and tell you click this and do that, many people even don't know how to play this game- The height of the tracks changes with the landform of the map, it will not great if I want to build any uplifting/downlifing track in a straight line- You need to change every section in the timetable, if I want to make a line 2 hours a car , I will need to unbox every section of time- The coverage of the station is very hard to see, while CiM1 has some colours to indicated it.- Player can't repay the debt if they have money and CiM1 can- The passengers walk to the entrance of the station for metro or monorails and they will be magically teleported to the station platform- I think the landmarks cannot replace the airport and in-game train stations, CiM2 should add airport and in-game train stationsSuggestions:- Use less RAM- Build some tiny map?- Make a user-friendly tutorial- The height of the tracks a determine by the sea level, not the ground- Add a user's default timetable setting or a change all the time sections button?- Add a button to repay the debt if player have enough money to do thatConclusion:This game is great if you know how to play it, you will start to addicted on it. Hopfully, the GUI will be better for new players to use it and more people will play the multiplayer mod			"

												As of writing this review, the game costs $20. For that price I would maybe recomend it, but definetly buy it if it goes on sale as it has in the past.I got about 30 hours out of it and maybe will get more. I'll start with con's since there are so few:-Campaign is pretty simple in terms of building/planning: Just build a central metro/tram and then build buses/trolleys to feed into it. You'll always make a profit, and by the time you can, you are able to get 100% coverage on the campaigns.-Not able to see all the routes people use who live/work in a build. You have to click on each person (opens a new window), then click on where they commute to (opens up a new window) and then on that window you have to click the scroll to button that moves your camera to that building, and then you have to close all the windows to see anything. Repeat these steps for each person. It really sucks the planning out of the game as you are just throwing down lines wherever you think people need them without any data to go on other than ""buildings are here"".Pro's:-Great graphics-Entertaining game if you like managing the public transit system and tweaking the schedule of different lines and solving the bottle necks that occur with things like having a busy metro interchange with a busstop.Overall recomend to play and explore, but it's lack of dept prevents playing it for much more than 30 hours unless you are really into this genre. Buy it on sale.			"

Seems like they made so many dlc's for this game, you need so much money about it, this might be the way that cities skylines might end up.This game is fun, but gets tedious in the long run.Recommended for playing around with transportation system and one negative due to the amount of dlc's.

												Background: I love city builders and have wanted to try this twist on the genre for quite some time.. and then Humble Bundle comes to the rescue. Have played the base game with none of the expansions.Impressions: This is such a hard game to give a fair review too.. and it's not that it's a bad game... it just has a  frustrating element to seemingly balance out every good one. The biggest issues are with the tutorial poorly describes the two systems it covers and does very little to prepare you for the deep-end when it finishes. To really play with any degree of success it's essential to watch some tutorials videos online and read some fan sites to get information on just how the transport systems work. There's so much game play and it's fun to build thriving economies but so frustrating when you cant see why your city is failing or when one poor choice has you scurrying back to the last save you made till you save before placing every single building.The Good:*Decent graphics and sound, not amazing but more than adequate.*Nice touches like seeing individual people travelling around the network.*A range of transport options that are nicely animated.*Pre-order bonuses are now free in the inbuilt store.*Intelligently connecting lines gives satisfying results.*Growing a city really feels like you are making a difference.*Creating routes requires some thought and the campaign makes you think more as you progress.*Campaign is really fun, if disjointed, as you town hop back-n-fore.The Bad:*Steep learning curve and terribly inadequate tutorial.*Graphics and sound don't wow you but aren't irritating either.*Despite a range of transport several systems feel too much alike.*Campaign missions are repetitive, boring and lack vital info.*Ticket pricing and wages are lacking depth.*Despite dozens of information windows some feedback just isn't available.*Setting timetables is a chore, even with the copy function.*Building/Stop upgrading is initially confusing.*Very limited modding options, which could have been really fun.Recommended for:City builders and god game people. Certainly for teenagers as there's little to wow a younger audience.Conclusion.7/10. I so badly want to give this an 8/10 but the problems in the base game stop it being as fun as it so nearly was.

												I'd love to recommend this because the original Cities in Motion is amazing. However the sequal just doesn't measure up somehow. The cities, which are all absolutely vast, lack character and feel largely homogenous; building routes is a bit more awkward with the requirement for depots; and the variable-height metro systems are awkward. Elevated metro lines often float unsupported, and feature teleport booths to travel between ground and platform level.Avoid. Play the original Cities in Motion instead, it's so much better.			"

												Cities in Motion 2 is a well made game. The city grows dynamically with night/day cycle but no weather.You're in charge to develop and maintain the various cities public transportation. In game this includes: Buses, Trams, Trolleys (Busses with overhead electric lines), boats, and trains(metro which includes subway). Each individual in the game's world is given a category among others: pensioner, businessman, student, tourist, white collar worker and blue collar worker. Each of these categories has their own public transportation preferences and different service level expectancies. So you try to cater for their different needs while trying to make the company profitable to further expand your services. All in all it's quite a detailed game. The learning curve can be a little bit daunting at first but highly rewarding once everything has been figured out. Attention to details and thoughtful design (the head developer was a female so attention to details and thoughtfulness are superb) made this game an enjoyable one to play especially online in cooperation mode. Highly recommended for family LAN game party. This is one of those games that has a little bit education in it for your children while still being genuinely fun to play for an adult.			"

												One of the first things you will want to do is go into the options and enable mouse screen scrolling, which is bizarely disabled by default for some reason.I played the first game when it came out and was pleasantly surprised, although the game was rather buggy (in relation to traffic and DLC). Although I have to say I enjoy playing the first one more than this sequel and although the games have the same theme they very much feel like different games.This game also seems a big buggy as I was given several missions\tasks of creating routes between buildings and after doing so still staying at 0%. Fortunately the game allows you to cancel these misisons\tasks without penalising you and shortly afterwards a new mission will appear. The rewards given vs the the costs of creating a route is also quite a bit out. The missions\tasks also do seem a bit repetitive and uninspiring.I feel the DLC is a bit overpriced and a bit of a cash cow, where some of it should be included with the game.Although given its downsides the graphics are good, although you are more likely to keep zoomed out in a overhead view most the time as this is easier to place stops, the game is unique but I would still play the original cities in motion before trying this one.

												There is definitley depth to this game, so anyone who likes getting deep into the game systems and learning how they work will get some enjoyment out of this title. However, the simulation is just not up to snuff and it becomes apparent fast, which breaks immersion (if you're looking for that kind of stuff). There are a lot of controls but half of them are so obscured under other controls and options that navigating the UI is about as easy as finding a needle in a haystack! Overall, I would recommend this only if you really want to play a transport sim and you've gotten your fill of all the others out there (but i doubt there are too many of you that fit that statement).

Well I have 180+ hours in this game hmmm, lots of negative reviews complaining about really weird things.So one guy on here complained about Metro tracks and space and to sharp of a turn... umm seriously? How tight are you making the bloody track lmao!!!Another person complained about the decision to bring vehicles back to depos at the end of their trip. In which case, where else would they go? The way vehicles degrade in this game it almost impossible to run a vehicle on a line twice or more, unless your line is so small that it pointless to even put together as it not going to generate money.So yea... I don't really understand the hate for this game.

												Cities in motion 2 is a game where you have to build a transportation system. When I first purchased the game, my friends were saying to me 'Why did you buy this, not Sims?'This game is NOT like sims. The sole objective is to move people around, and this aspect of the game has been greatly presented, as there are loads of types of transport you can use. This game also has lots of DLC, which is not needed to have a good time but can greatly expand the game. The community is great, and the Steam Workshop means you can download custom maps- and on top of all of this, it even has Steam trading cards!Overall, I would give this game 9.5/10.			"

The only downside is for some reason people complain ticket prices are too high, so I lower them until they are in the green zone (Meaning best price), then 5 or 10  minutes later people complain they are too low. This form of micromanagment ultimately ruined this game for me and made in unplayable as I had to spend so much of my time just changing ticket prices, only for it to complain again once I had changed it.

So Blue Collar Workers will need certain transport and White Collar other. Friday Nights get busy wit hpeople heading out to leisure locations more.

												First of all, let me say that the game is rather fun. It's fun, addictive, and kills time rather nicely.However, let's start off with the first and most glaring flaw of the game: Lack of a proper tutorial. There is a tutorial, but it's very basic and fails to explain anything beyond your first basic bus route on roads that already exist, leaving the rest of the game's mechanics a complete mystery.Second is the gameplay itself. It just feels clunky and unintuitive. When you design a system, you need to get it right the first time, or you'll be ****ed and have to scrap it and do it all over again. There is also zero capability to change said system once it's already in place.Third is the UI. It's clunky, unintuitive, all over the place, and you have no idea what any of the buttons actually DO. That is, until you accidentally replace that one apartment building with a train station.And finally, there isn't really much to DO, other than ""don't go bankrupt"". In similar games like OpenTTD (Transport Tycoon), even if you don't have an AI, you still feel like you're accomplishing something. You start off with a few cities and industries which are in desperate need of connections between each other. But in this game, you essentially start off in a city without any problems whatsoever. Everyone seems to be getting around rather happily, without any congestion of any sorts. Sure, the town is missing public transit, but it seems to be of little concern to its citizens.You can expand your cities by building roads, but in the majority of the cases, there isn't any room for any more roads. Every spot is already taken up by other roads, or water.Instead of fixing the numerous bugs and issues this clearly unfinished and unpolished game has, the developers instead opt to release more DLC. The game could've been so much better if the developers had spent a few weeks polishing the game.If you're a fan of games like this, consider buying it during a sale. 20 euros is way too much to justify buying this.

Do you want a unmoddable, unexpandable(as of now 12/1/13, there are no known expansions other than the monorail.), and generally generic game? Well, here you go, a city transport game in full 3D with a handful of vehicles to haul people and NO goods or other transport-worthy stuff. However since this game is a people transport game I suppose I can ignore that fact. However I cannot ignore the fact that after you plop the stations and watch the buses go... there is nothing else to do... I have played OTTD (Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe) and I can be on it for hours, mainly due to the fact you have TRAINS. In CiM2 I play with some metros which oversimplify the game generally. Also, you'd have to pay at least $5 more to get a decent amount of trains or verierity, since the regular game has just 2. This puts me into the main problem of the game, the game lacks a worthwhile amount of content. You get about 11 vehicles in total (14 or so if you preordered like me) and probably 150 props and buildings. Thats it. The devs are working to cram more vehicles, but only if you pay $5 for 5 vehicles. It is unknown if the devs want to make a building pack as well.Something I can give it credit is its road system, it has a really  flexible road system which includes from roads, expressways, and one way roadsGraphics:Odd, the graphics/color sceme might not be for everyone, I had mod it in order to suit my tastes. Modeling and texturing are fair but not world-class.6/10Content:As I said before, there isn't much beyond the 150 buildings and props, and the handful of 11 vehicles in the regular version, the DLC adds some  20 more but the cost of that alone can buy the game probably twice.4/10Gameplay:Gameplay is well, like it is, you place a line from point A to B, and hope to make as many stops as possible to make more money. It generally thereafter is just making sure you have sufficient vehicles and depots to store them. Making grids with the roads is a hazzard, since the roads don't snap with each other in order to make crossings, thus resulting in you making grids road by road until you have a grid. After all is done and said, there is pretty much nothing else to do.5/10Rating:5/10 My Final Opinion:Don't buy this at full price, or better yet, buy CiM1, you'd have more fun than this dead end game. Maybe if you wait a year or two maybe the game gets better. Right now, its not worth the $20 (+ $27 DLC).			"

												It took me a very long time to get into this one. I played it in fits and starts.However, once I understood the underlying systems I spent a good deal of time enjoying it. Like a lot of building games, it's easy to spend hours and hours doing tiny little tweaks.If you're struggling to enjoy this, it's probably worth doing a bit of research on howtos.I liked the way the campaign worked, returning to previously completed maps. This meant that you really had to plan for the long term on each map.			"

												If this is the type of game you'd enjoy, CIM 2 is truly mesmerizing.  At the same time, there are many things that stop this game from being as great as it could have been.  As you can see I've put many hours into it, so I thought it deserved a review.  This review is designed for people who are already sold on the concept of running a virtual transit agency and are more interested in an opinion how it's been executed in this game.In my opinion, here are the pro's and con's of CIM 2 compared to CIM 1.PROS:1)Way bigger cities than CIM 1.  One map can provide many hours of gameplay.2)Easy to make maps that are true to real life cities with the ""maps4cim"" fan tool.  Recreating a real city is a huge endeavor but some really brilliant maps have been created with it. 3)Although the timetables are more fiddly than I'd like them to be, they're still an improvement over CIM 1.  Instead of messing with the timetables I just set the same service frequency 24/7.  For example, once an hour.  In CIM 1, it was much more painful to make sure your vehicles stay spaced out, and I would avoid modifying my lines as long as possible to avoid the pain of dispatching my vehicles evenly.4)No lag even on large cities.  In CIM1, performance bogs down with a medium to large network, which is much smaller than the largest networks you can build with no problems in CIM2.5)You can expand the city yourself if you find you're flush with cash and need a new project.CONS:1)Can't color code metro lines!  In CIM 1, the Line statistics Plus mod allows you to individually color lines which is awesome for metros.  Anyone with an unusual attraction to metro systems knows that one of the most interesting things about a metro system is analyzing how all the colored lines meet up for transfers on the map.2)Ticket pricing is annoying and adds no value to the gameplay experience.  There are 5 transit types, 6 with monorails, and each transit type has 7 types of tickets.  So you have to fiddle with up to 42 different ticket prices on a regular basis.  What cims consider a reasonable fare for each ticket changes frequently.3)The art direction in CIM2 is much lower quality than in CIM1.  The CIM2 home and loading screens are ugly and use garish colors while the screens in CIM1 are very pleasing and interesting.  Buildings and colors are nicer looking in CIM 1.  The music in CIM 2 is not as good; I turned the music off and instead downloaded the SimCity 2013 soundtrack to listen to while playing.  The UI for CIM1 is much easier to use, and CIM2 text is often difficult to read.  Only the vehicles in CIM2 get proper artistic love.4)The more complex your network gets, the weirder your cims choose their paths.  I get around this by avoiding double service in areas beyond connecting points and using the ruleset editor to make sure all vehicles have 100% passenger attractiveness.5)Random crashes and no autosave.  I've had a few instances where I played for 5 hours straight and forget to ever save, then the game crashes.  Then I ragequit and don't play for several weeks.NEUTRAL:1)Metro lines are easier to place than CIM 1 once you get the hang of it.  You can make bendy tracks and underground stations don't take up any space above ground.  In CIM 1 an above ground building may need to be destroyed to build a station entrance.  The tradeoff here is that train stations are less visually pleasing than they were in CIM 1.  Instead of watching passengers take the stairs down to the platforms, they get in a magical teleporter from the steet to the platform.2)expanding on the above, the ease of placement is almost too easy in CIM2.  There's no challenge at all in building metro lines since you have variable height placement and the street grid above has no impact on placement.  In CIM1, you're limited to only 3 levels of track at intersections as well as the restrictions of the buildings and streets above ground.  CIM2 placement is very easy and CIM1 is challenging, though frustrating at times.  I think the best way to solve this would be to add geology/geography as a bigger placement factor.  For example, make it more expensive to tunnel through bedrock than softer soil, and more expensive to tunnel under buildings than under roads or empty space.  Also, make above ground tracks cheaper than underground so there's an incentive to choose wisely between the two.  This is certainly out of scope for CIM 2 but one can dream for CIM 3 :)IN SUMMARY:If you're more interested in an arcade-style game that's visually pleasing, go with CIM 1.  If you're looking for a game with greater simulation depth, more network flexibility, and you're not terribly turned off by bad art, choose CIM 2.  Both games are great in their own right.  I wouldn't recommend either game to anyone, and which game is better depends on the individual's preferences more than one game being any ""better"" than the other.  If you think you'll probably like both games, play CIM1 till you get bored, then play CIM2.			"

												This game, is awesome.The bottom line is if you want to play a transport management sim with modern graphics and the option for co-op multiplayer(or any multiplayer, really), there are not really any other options.The layers of statistics and depth are really amazing in this game.  It is easy to lose track of time, watching just one line and figuring out the best number of vehicles, type of vehilcles and adjusting time tables and ticket prices.  The game is not just about plopping down lines to reach the most people.  There is an endless amount of tinkering you can do to each line, trying to make sure it is the most efficient.  I have not yet had a chance to play in multiplayer, but that is the biggest reason I got the game.  There are a few other transport sims with a different focus(like transporting goods as well as people), but this is the only one that I know has multiplayer.  I imagine it will be quite a fun experience.I haven't seen any of the problems others have had.  I expect to rack up quite a few hours on this game.			"

												Cities in Motion 2 (CM2) is published by Paradox, so that should tell you three things: first, it has a steep learning curve; second, it has a horrific UI and mind-boggling design decisions; and third, it will take something mundane and make it addictive. CM2 really has a problem with the second of these. For example, the victory conditions of the campaign maps are ""Have x% coverage"". Unfortunately for the player, ""coverage"" means nothing like the English word ""coverage,"" and its precise meaning is never explained. This makes the game artificially difficult. Despite these gripes, the game still is entertaining.While entertaining, and definitely worth the $5 I paid for it, I can't bring myself to recommend this game. This is due in part to the designer's attitude towards DLC ($5 for more busses?) and how its patches focus on niche markets (Mac-only issues, Linux compatibility) despite persistent and well-documented bugs that affect everyone.TL;DR: Engaging and entertaining, yet buggy, has awful UI, and is worse than an EA game for DLC.

												I never played CiM1, and I only have an hour and a half on this game, but bear with me.This is not a good game in my eyes. It simply isn't. Coming from a guy that is obsessed with Cities: Skylines, this might sound strange, but the game has a terrible tutorial. And I mean a TERRIBLE one. The first time I played the game, I quit in the first 15 minutes out of pure frustration. I suppose setting up bus lines isn't all that bad, but making train tracks or changing timetables is pure torture in this game. Unfortunately, that's all you do in this game. Combined with the terrible tutorial and thus the severely steep learning curve, this game is not worth buying unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing and enjoy such things. I would give this game a 4.5/10, and would recommend not buying it, even on a sale, unless you are something like a train dispatcher or a road builder.(But check out Cities: Skylines. THAT game is good).Thanks for reading this review. I hope that it helps you save money and spare you from the insanity of timetables.			"

												For a simulation game centered around public transportation, it's fun. I actually have fun and find myself thinking about the game when i'm not playing it. It's addictive and hard to stop if you're into these kind of games. Saddly, the game has an issue with ""crashes"". Not in-game crashed which would probably be cool. But actually crashes of the game, it freezes and you have to force quit Steam altogether. If this happened once in a while it would be ok, but this happens at least 4 to 5 times a day. My Mac's specs are high and updated and I have the graphic rendering lower than normal. But the game has a lot of crashes. Other than that, the game is a pleasure to play and I would recommend it to everyone that would like it. "

												I really loved this game! Even with Cities: Skylines now out, this game focuses more on the public transportation aspect of a city, and from what I've experienced in real life, these mechanics seem quite realistic. For someone who is really interested in a simulation/engineering game genre, this game really hits the spot. The game's experience is great, and the openness of the single player quests really encourages you to achieve them your own way in your city. With so many options, you can truly play a completely different game than somebody else. I really hope others like me can enjoy this game, and a special thanks to my friend for gifting me this game in the first place! :)			"

												I loved the idea that this was an in depth simulation type game where one could define routes, timetables, vehicle allocations etc, the reviews that claimed this game was more ""work"" than game appealed to me- However there are some fatal flaws that make the game unplayable.Foremost- Placing metro lines is IMPOSSIBLE. The underground view is bad. The system for drawing out lines is based on a pen tool, rather than a pencil tool to make a photoshop analogy, which is theoretically nice for drawing curves and whatnot... but it just doesn't work. It needs to be reworked or redone from scratch, it is just too difficult to use. I know where I want to draw the lines, I just cannot do it. The underground view is bad. There need to be more view/transparency options and if they do exist, they need to be more readily accessible. So being as how this is a game about making subways laying subway lines is so frustrating as to be nearly impossible, this game is a fail. On the note of it being a detailed sim, there was a strange choice to make all lines start and end at depots- busses trains and trolleys alike. This doesn't make sense, as most real world transit lines do not start and end at depots..The visuals are good. Fix the metro laying tool and the weird depot system and I'll change this review to positive.			"

												Much better than the original Cities in Motion, which was complete ♥♥♥♥ and very hard to make a profit on (even on Easy mode). Cities in Motion 2 has much better graphics, improved laying of tram and commuter rails including the option of elevated tracks. Routes can become crowded quite quicky if they are long distance and become popular, and it does take a while to work out the best solution to minimise delays and make better profits allowing you to invest back into improving your network.The multiplayer has an odd few bugs depending on saves between those playing but all of this can be fixed each time by sending the save file to the rest of the party. Other than that it is great fun and adds alot to a genre of ""Transport Tycoon"" strategy games that no other has before.			"

												The first thing that I should say is that this game will not appeal to everybody. That is heavily reflected upon seeing all the negative reviews on this game. That being said, I really enjoy this game.It took me quite a while to get into the game and actually start playing it. I didn't play the actual career before passing the 80 hour mark, spending all of my time on sandbox. Truth is, the career isn't much to mention as it isn't any difficult and not anything that I will remember as a memorable time. The sandbox however, is a totally different thing.The amount of fun I had while just playing around in the sandbox and trying to get 100% coverage on a city is what took most of my hours spent on this game, and it will be this way for many others. I'd say this game is worth getting for it's sandbox. Especially with all the workshop content being created.The one thing that I find a bit sad is that multiplayer is as good as dead. But find a friend with the game and you'll have a good time creating stuff together or competing to be the best.Buy on sale.			"

												In respect to those who give this game where credit is due, I find that this game can be pretty lacking in the field of public transit. In my eyes, a ""perfect"" public transit system is where all forms of transit follow three requirements: Convienence, Punctuality, and Reliability. Convience: To an extent, it's only the connection in this aspect that matters. If you are a regular transit commuter you will know that sometimes a train, bus, tram, plane, or even a ferry will run late by a few minutes to almost 15min-1hr. in this game this factor is taken accounted for, but it doesn't allow the player to have a convience factor. If a train station also doubles up as a bus station then it's easier to figure out your connection timing. From my time in San Fransico and Oakland the bus, tram, and trains would normally run on time and run inacordance together. That's what I hate about Cities in Motion 2 the most. Punctuality: With any transit system you want to see that your bus or any other form of transit runs on timme according to the schedule. CiM2 does catter to this by having correct departure times, but sometimes the vehicles will fall behind by a substantial nummber. Reliability: For a realiable transit system you must know that the bus driver will wait for you, CiM2 does not take this into account for any reason. In my  opinion for this game after playing 400+ hours of it, CiM2 is not for the modern day simulation world.			"

												Trying to place a road or train track in this game is akin to being forced to solve graduate level calculus.But it's not because the process itself is overly complicated - it's just that when you try placing a road, on the off-chance you actually find a spot the game will let you place one, the road usually isn't anywhere near where you want it to go. My trams were taking forever, and the tram customers were terribly unhappy, all because I had to route it the long way around a few intersections that were inexplicably blocked from tram tracks for no apparent reason.Another time, after I'd finally managed to sort out the bus route and the tram route, I tried to create a metro. I tried placing train tracks over a road, thinking it would make an overpass, or at the very least tell me I couldn't do that - instead, it simply demolished my road, stopping my tram and bus routes in the process. I quit playing when I couldn't find any way to undo that.			"

												I must say that this game came as a pleasant surprise! Initially this game came with a bundle I bought over a year ago, and due to the mixed (and many negative) reviews I only had bad expectations about it and therefor never bothered to try it out. That was until yesterday. Yesterday I finally tried to give it a shot just for the sake of picking up the trading cards, but I actually enjoyed playing the game. There are so many things to build and manage in it. It kind of feels like a city simulator game, but then with the focus on transportation. Due to the focus only being on transportation, I expected there wouldn't be a lot to manage, but there are actually dozens if not hundreds of management options within this game. I love it. I've noticed that quite a few negative reviews are regarding supposed bugs within the game, while those supposed bugs aren't bugs at all. For example, there are reviews about it being impossible to construct a metro line. This is not due to bugs, but due to its constructing complexity. I can see why some people consider quite a few things within the game as bugs, because the tutorial within this game is sadly quite bad. And the game itself doesn't offer any further information as for how the game works. Therefor I strongly recommend anyone who plays this game to look up a few tutorial videos or guides made by other players (I'd almost say it's a necessity) because that will certainly make you understand how the game works. It at least in my case. For what the game offers, I think that the price for Cities in Motion 2 is just right. It's definitely worth it if you're into city managing simulators.What a beautiful hidden gem of a game. I'm sad to see that it's so underrated which is majorly due to misinterpretation.			"

Who came up with this UI?!? You think a little carryover in the controls and interface would happen. NOTHING.

Why WOULD YOU MAKE THE BUTTON THAT USED TO OPEN THE CONSTRUCTION MENU COMPLETELY CHANGE YOUR POSITION ON THE MAP! WHY DID YOU DO THIS. And its not just carrying over controls. This is the least intutive menu system I have ever worked with. If you don't do things in an exact order, it is punitive in making you go through another menu system instead of having the oft used function right next to it.Sorry guys.

To me, this just didn't deliver the experience I was expecting.			"

												Found it to be very boring. Seemed like an interesting idea of running a transit company, but the games execution on this is very poor. Ended up spending bulk of my time with the game on fast forward hoping something interesting would happen. Just ended up waiting for the trickling in of cash to buy more transit buildings and vehicles. Not really my cup of tea.			"

												Nearly Identical as the first installment. Main difference i think is the increased complexity of route setups. You can set a bus ""schedule"" changing the amount of vehicles for different times of the day (ie. more busses during rush hour, less during midnight.) Other than that, it seemed nearly identical, but with new cities. Same engine, same models almost lol. Still fun.			"

												Re-reviewed as previous review was too 'thin'.Overview:Cities in Motion 2 is a transport simulation game where you get to control and manage a fleet of vehicles, build stops, set up lines, decide fares, and manage employees. It offers a few cities packed into the base game to select with the option to download more from the steam workshop, as well as short campaign.Pros:- The game's core mechanics just feel right. The timetable is relatively easy to grasp, the line planner is intuitive, and the vehicle selector is simple.- The cities packed into the base game are incredibly well thought out, in the sense that they look and feel real. The traffic bunches up just right on that midtown exit, the highway to get from that industrial area to the suburbs is always busy at rush hour, the cinemas, museums and attractions are in the culture district, nestled near a park. The cities have character, but lack a transport system, and that's where you come into play.- The game is bundled with a map editor. The map editor is so in-depth it practically doubles as a city builder stand alone (granted, your options for buildings are limited to either hand placing everything, or randomly filling in the whole map, then if you want you can edit it and hand place things). For a game already so in depth, I've had endless fun trying to make my own city in the map editor.Cons:- What the public think of your ticket prices fluctuates violently. One day everyone is super pleased about your ticket prices, and when you add a new bus line the next day, ridership plummets. I have no idea why it happens at all, but it does.- Once you've made functioning transport systems for all base game cities, you have no choice but to download more cities otherwise the game gets boring.- Trolleybusses are USELESS. Nobody rides them. The only way to make money off of them it seems, is to make a single parallel line up and down a large avenue.- Graphics aren't top notch. Granted, it doesn't affect gameplay, but those who can't play a game without super optimized HD graphics may want to stray away.- Minor visual glitches. Nothing major, just things like bendy busses ripping apart when making certain turns, or subway trains seperating carriges on some bends. I've seen a waterbus once became a submarine.- Very limited vehicle choice. There's only 3 different busses, 2 subway trains, 3 trams, 2 waterbusses, and 2 trolleys. It feels like the vehicles that are there are missing a few types. Granted, you CAN buy what seems to be the 'missing' vehicles in DLC, but that's a really cheeky business strategy if you ask me. I personally think there should've been more vehicles bundled into the base game. 5 busses would be nice, 3 or 4 subways, 4 or more trams, and a minimum of 3 trolleys.Overall:If you're a fan of simulation games, city builders, and management games, pick this one up. It'll have you saying ""why is my tram line getting such low ridership!?"" while tearing out your hair.Also it's made by the same folks who made Cities:Skylines. What's not to like?All in all, I recommend this game. It's a fun and different management sim, and nothing else on the market compares. It's like a better OpenTTD with modern graphics.			"

												I just can't find the fun in this game. Of course, that's probably my fault since I couldn't find the fun in CIM 1 either and stupidly bought CIM 2. Shame on me. I'm not going to waste time describing the game as there are plenty of places to find that out. My impressions are that the game is dry, the feedback is lacking and that the pre-established cities make it more of a pain because you're stuck within the limitations of what someone else has already created. Finally, there's no progression. So what does all that mean?1. Dry - You'll get the occasional mission from someone to connect A to B, but in my (albeit limited) time with the game nothing else seems to happen. The world is supposed to change, but it doesn't happen very quickly. There don't seem to be any disasters or major situations the player should respond to. For instance, it might be fun if the city council designated an area as an economic recovery zone and required you to help with mass transit to that area. Or a new theme park opens and you can take advantage of that. That doesn't seem to happen. I don't get any sense of creativity or accomplishment in CiM2.2. Lacking Feedback - Probably my biggest beef. I have no idea why some routes make money and some don't. I can't get the feedback I need to make decisions. How profitable is a line? Not sure where to find that. Maybe it's in there, maybe it's not but it's not intuitive at the very least. Where's the highest demand? Where's the lowest demand? How much do some people like certain vehicles (I think this is in the manual, but doesn't spell out exactly the percentages which make a huge difference). So I feel like I'm building aimlessly and that's fatal in a business simulator.3. Cities Pre-Established - I hate this. The first campaign takes you into a massive city. Changing roads or doing anything substantial to the road system is impossible due to the cost. So I'm ""band-aiding"" the transportation system and not creating. There isn't even a sandbox map that's wide open. I feel confined. Again, no creativity makes Jack a Dull Boy.4. No Progression - At least CIM 1 had different eras. It had a horrible interface too, which is why I didn't play it much. But you saw your town progress and you got new vehicles as the years went by. In this game, you're in the modern era so there's no progression. It really takes away from the game. Same vehicles, same cities, same approaches. Yawn.In short, I can't find the fun. The game seems like it might be a deep simulation, but with all the factors above I'm bored out of my mind shortly after loading it up. Thanks but I actually require entertainment as part of my gaming pleasures. Skip it.			"

												this game has a few bugs just like all games  but some of them are terrible such as:1)when building a piece of road or metro track to an existing road or metro track, the arrows that point to the direction that the line is heading towards suddenly dissapears until the nearest stop is deleted or a vehcile o that line goes onto that piece of road or tack.CONS:Instead of fixing the bugs they decided introduce some DLC & they stopped development of the game is early 2015 so that they could start developing their latest game: Cities Skylines. TBH I think they only made this game & some DLC so that they could fund development of cities skylines which turned out to be much much worse than this game due to terrible traffic physics.PRO's:Able to change the timetable of transport routes that you tender (You Cannot Un-Tender any services such as bus lines or tram lines.Able to Gain & Loose MONEYhas a PARAMETER EDITORhas a MAP EDITORhas a SCENARIO EDITORhas MAPS larger than Sim City 2013has a TILT SHIFT EFFECTallows you to buy upto 10 vehciles at any single time (Can be changed with parameters upto 30)VERY ADDICTIVE as this stopped me from playing the addictive PRISON ARCHITECT.

But one day, my family was taking the bus home. It was being driven by none other than my grandfather. Suddenly, one the wheels bursted into flames. We crashed into an orphanage.

												Quite different from Sim City 4 and Paradox's Cities Skylines. This game I found quite enjoyable despite my lack of interest relating to the management of mass transit systems. Overall managing and building the lines and routs for your mass transit systems isn't all too bad. The only issue I have with this game is that the random requests from citizens and challenges can seem bizzare when then only benifit a small block of your city's transit line.			"

												Introduction: Cities in Motion 2 is a City Management game, where you are in charge of the public transportation of different cities. The game comes with 6 standard fictional cities: Central, East, West, South, North and Tutorial City, and many more cities avalible to download on the Steam Workshop, where you also can download rulesets, which changes the capicity and more, and Scenarios. The graphics are a lot better then in Cities in Motion 1, and you now can change timetables and you have a 24 hours day-cycle with rush-hour periods. You can have buses, trams, metros, trolleys, waterbuses (boats) and if you have the Marvellous Monorails DLC, Monorails. You can play and build freely in Sandbox mode, and if you want, even with unlimited money. If you have had enough playing alone, try out the Multiplayer mode (I've never tried it out, so i know nothing about it).My experience: So, i didn't enjoy the game in the beginning, as i didn't know how it worked, but after about 3 hours i understood the basics and after almost 200 hours, i'm still learning new things. This game has became my second most played game and it is soon going to be the most played game, and i have it for over a year now. I have 6 of the 12 DLC:s and i've probalbly only wasted 20€ in total on the game, as i've bought everything while it was on sale, if you compare it with Train Simulator, where i wasted around 150€, even if it was on sale. Positive things about CIM2:- The gameplay is amazing. When you get the hang on how the game works, you might get addicted, like i did. - The graphics are so great. Comparing to Cities in Motion 1 or Transport Tycoon Deluxe, it has the best graphics of any public transport management game.- The amount of DLC. If you ever get tired of the normal vehicles, you can always buy DLC:s to expand your fleet. - 24 hour day-cycle with rush-hour periods, which make the game more realistic. Negative things about CIM2:- It takes a while to understand the gameplay. For me it took about 3 hours, but for some people, it took even longer. You have to learn how to choose your line's route, how to make a line, and how to manage it. - Because the graphics are so good, you will need agood graphics-card to run this game at a high framrate. - The vehicles you get if you buy it without any DLC are not many. You get 3 buses, 3 trams, 1 trolley and 1 waterbus. - The DLC price is high. The European Cities DLC and Marvellous Monorails DLC are very expensive comparing with the other, which i would pay for. Final Statement:I really recommend this game to anyone who likes construction and manangement games. It takes a while to get the hang over it, but when you have, it is amazing. I would recommend to buy the European Vehicle pack aswell when you buy the game. And i would recommend to buy the game while it's on sale. Final rating: 8,7/10			"

												This was a surprise ! Honestly, I tried demo version some time ago, but... well, it was a demo, and it lacks a lot of things. So I was not satisfied and banned the game. But then one of my mates from school told me, that this game has actually pretty deep and sofisticated level of simulation, and boy, he convinced me to buy :) And I am GLAD that i bought this one ! My mate was totallt right - this game has madning simulation abstraction ! Everything int the city is an object and everything is in computers memory - I mean really, can you believe that ? Now I am playing in a city with 60 thounsand people, an ALL of them all there ! Even theyr cars are there, everything is alive ! You can track one person and watch his every move in the city ! It is amazing ! And not to mention building actual travel lines. There are buses, troleybuses, trams, subeays and omnibuses, which are something like a bus on the water. There is not much what I can take as a bad thing in game. Souns are 8/10, soundtrack is 8.5/10 - very fitting and adictive, but quite repetiting, so you mayne will end up with turning it off and playing your onw music instead, althougt I must say that combo of soft techno and soft electro is very fitting and I enjoy it a lot - the core simulation 10/10, putting lines 10/10, well... ok, maybe not for subway. I just CAN NOT figure out how to place subway lines ! Honestly, this is a nightmare for me, and I hope I will figure it out, because my city is crying for these :-) Well as a result, I will give it 9.5/10, and that 0.5 point down is for subway :-) But it is my fault I guess. Mechanics are smooth, simulation works great, and game can even solve some sorts of glitches that may appear, or when I suddenly delete a station with busses already there :-D I testet it a lot and I am trully satisfied. This game will entertain me for months.			"

												You can have some minutes with fun, but that's all.This game only have a very limited number of vehicles, with totally illogical stats.. Why a classical bus can only have 40% satisfaction ?Build an underground metro has bugged, 9/10 time you can't build a railway under the road !Lags are common after around one hour of games, and IA has some problems with combo bus+tram in intersections.Objects doesn't work all time.Spend your money day after day, but is borring after one in-game week.I love this genre, but this game cannot be perfect without more content, unbugged metro, and more events/fun.This is sad because Cities in Motion 2 can be a very great game, some details like growable cities add something, but dosen't make the game.

												I really tried to like this game. And it does have its good points. The cities look really nice, there's a decent variety in the types of cars and boats you can put out on the streets, and I even enjoyed messing up and starting over when I realized the routes I set down wouldn't work. It was decently challenging, but not hopelessly so.But! But my real problem is that unless I wanted to sit there with the game running for hours without doing anything, well...I couldn't do anything. I build a few things, I run out of money. Ok! My budget is all in the green, I'll just wait for more money to come in, right? So I wait. And wait. And wait.

												The tutorial in this game is useless, since there's a ton of little annoying things that are not intuitive. But once you know, it works: You have to delete and rebuild roads to get bus lanes. Trams can have tracks on medians and pedestrian paths, and you have to build the tram station appropriately (in the median or on the side of the road). Metros can be built elevated or underground with the page up/page down key (minimum clearance is 8m, which is two page ups/page downs). Building metro track at elevation zero (0 m) will enable your cursor to snap to metro track stubs. Building a metro track/road curve is like using the pen tool in photoshop: you drop a vertex with left click and you undo the last vertex with right click. Waterbuses cannot navigate through/around terrain, so you have to manually waypoint around those. The metro passenger entry point is that tiny ""teleportation box"" that appears on the nearest roadway when you build the station. Tram tracks/Trolley Wires need to be connected through intersections by clicking on the tracks/wires on one side, then clicking on the side you want to connect to. If there's no routable path to the next station, zoom in and inspect the roads for one-way streets and missing intersections. When you delete intersecting roads/metro tracks, the remaining road can still have remnants of an ""intersection"" that makes it count as two roads. That ""intersection"" can be deleted again to turn the road back into a single piece of road/track.If you do play multiplayer, PAUSE THE GAME OR SLOW IT DOWN BEFORE DEMOLISHING ANYTHING, and try not to demolish a lot of things in rapid succession. Don't play it on the fastest speed. If you do desync, have one person share their save file with everyone else and overwrite their local saves, then try to rehost the game.You can adjust the rulesets to do things like make the game speed slower (helpful for big, lagtacular maps) and increase depot size (recommended).Hopefully reading this makes the game playable, since it's pretty fun once you know all the little things. But then again, I was determined to make it work.			"

As a transport simulator, this one ticks almost all of the boxes. 9/10			"

												Note: This is a review intended for people with the disability called age. Particularly Hyperopia, near-sightedness, the need for reading glasses (almost everyone over the age of 40)This game is unplayable. Period. I can't finish the tutorial because the font is not scalable and is by default extremely tiny and really ugly. The developers seem to be aware of the problem and there are a lot of people complaining about it on various forums, but they have as yet failed to fix the problem. There has been DLC,  there have been patches. And still the game is unplayable. It really is a shame because the first installment was a joy to play. The publishers are missing out because I am a DLC completion idiot. Come on, Paradox, get your whip out and get these developers to fix their game.			"

												I want to come out an make a review for this product. There are very few games created like this because it is a very niche market of video games. This game is great for those who like Transport Tycoon, Locomotion, OpenTTD, and similar games. What I like about this game is that it is very in depth with owning and running a transit system. Being in depth it is very complicated and takes a very long time to play. If you want a simpler and less time consuming transit game, go with the first Cities in Motion, but if you are up to a challenge get this one. I love these kinds of games and will buy them up, I enjoy this game and hope improve on the time consumption part of the game, but it is still a fun game.The hours on record is a little misleading because I had to leave my game open a lot to make a decent amount of money to expand my transit system (What I was saying about time consuming)			"

												Practically the same as as original cities in motion. Developers mostly ignored beta testers, updated graphics added day/night cycles, trains and that's it.I do like transport sims and this game has all of the necessary components - complexity, balance between micro and macromanagement, modability, slow learning curve... but it is also incredibly bleak, dull and lifeless. Cities look dead, colour palette is mostly made of grey, brown, muddy and depressing tones. Weather doesn't changeYou can't deselect with mouse clicks and developers notoriously ignored all requests for this feature. You can change your cities slightly but it wont affect traffic or population. ""Quests"" involve building lines to specific places in a city, connecting buildings and reaching certain amount of traffic usage. There's no rush and no competition, you can simply let the game run, amass money and build all over your city.It's not a bad game overall but unfortunately it gets boring, bland and repetitive very quickly.

Looked up some videos and found it to be quite fun. Basically all you do is enter a city and make a public transportation system in the city so it could expand and make you even more money. To any person that likes or has liked tycoon games this is for you, it is simple and it will keep you entertained for hours of your time. Also it's easy to learn how to play it, but if you want to master all the tricks you might need quite a few hours in the game!Definitely recommend it to everyone still thinking about buying it!			"

A breath of fresh air after the Sim City 5 fiasco, this much more playable game (from an indie developer - hello!) lets you manage a public transport company in various humongous regions that grow and change based on your work. You can even build tons of different roads and create your own cities from scratch! The tutorial is a bit hard to follow, but you'll quickly get the hang of the game once you just start playing.

												Cities in Motion 2 is pretty good. It definitely is true to purpose. It's a satisfying mass-traffic, public transport simulator and management game. I legitimately feel like I should be in an office building wearing a suit while I play this game, which, if you're interested, is probably exactly the kind of thing you're in to.It has a map editor. It has a rule set editor. Both of these allow you to customize the game surprisingly effectively. I, personally, went through the effort of looking at Google Maps images and remaking my home city and then proceeded to play that map with my friends.Road building is easy once you get the hang of it. Alternations of click and right-click allow you to customise the shape of your tracks and roads effectively. There is a lot of information available, so there is a bit of getting-used-to time required in order to navigate things correctly, from, for instance, lines to depots to buying vehicles. Timetables are important and there's a lot of micromanaging of vehicles and time required to ensure optimised routes and service. I would recommend starting with a standardised timetable (say, one vehicle every hour) to get the hang of it.You need to connect to direct IP to get multiplayer to work reliably. Using a VPN such as Hamachi is a good idea for this.All of the game's issues can be described as annoyances, which is an improvement on game-breaking issues, which many games have these days.To cut to the chase, the game has the following issues:- Multiplayer desyncs eventually, meaning eventually you and your friends will have different city economies, income, won't see certain things the others do, etc. You can fix this by manually getting them to replace their save file with yours, which can be tedious. It can take a satisfactory amount of time before this desync happens though, so multiplayer is still functional on a short-medium term basis.- Many additional vehicles are DLC. It's money grubbing, and it does have some effect on the game, but you don't need the DLC to enjoy the game to the fullest extent unless your enjoyment comes primarily from seeing differently coloured buses and trains. You can modify the game's rules to make your vanilla vehicles have the same or similar functionality to DLC vehicles. No particular loss, just annoying.- Changing ticket prices can be tedious, but there is a mod to help combat this (available through steam workshop).If you are reading reviews on this game, you must be interested in some sort of a city management game. This is a public transport management game. It has some city management elements, in that the city's growth is directly affected by the success of your public transport system, but it is mostly a business management game, the business being specifically a public transport system.I recommend it, you should try it, if you wanted to manage the busses and trains in a SimCity 4-esc city, whilst the city manages itself, and it is very good at doing that.

												Got this as part of a humble indie bundle. Looks... interesting. Thought it was a city sim of some sort, but I was wrong. It's a transport sim. It looks slick as hell, and I'm sure if you're the type of person who relishes the idea of meticulously planning bus/train/tram routes, this is probably the game for you!I wouldn't know if it is really good fun, because the game crashed when another program stole focus. Whereas that is very obviously an implementation flaw, I won't knock the game too much as that wouldn't be a common occurance (I hope).Anyways, I'm giving it a very shaky recommend: the game itself seems well polished and designed. However, not all people give a damn about maintaing a well planned bus route. Also, the crash when focus lost issue.			"

												Great game. People have complained how it was so different from CIM 1 and thats true but it is a different good. They just need more DLC and another transit mode or two and it would be great. Colossal Order is a great company yet small. They are very flexible and open and this game has more potential then it is now it could with some more publicity and minor improvements could get some people from the city builder market as well. This game would not replace Simcity or Cities XL but add another fun game to the libary for those people and aid them in their city building games. I play SImcity and my city runs so smothly thanks to some ideas from CIM2. Great game buy it. Ignore some of the not reccommended people out there they likely wanted it to be like CIM 1. If so thats fine buy and play CIM 1 and the people who like CIM 2 will buy and play that one. Great job Colossal Order			"

												CIM2 is a fantastic game in which you can create an entire transit system, either following scenarios or in sandbox mode.  The game itself is fantastic, and boasts excellent and lively graphics.  The game runs very smoothly for me and has never crashed on me, nor has it lagged badly.  (Although, don't try this on an under-par computer.  It WILL crash then, but it's a high graphic game.  What did you expect?)All in all, I truly enjoy this game.  It offers a plethora of playing time, as there is no definite end to the game.  I would definitely recommend grabbing it from the store if you have a chance.  It's worth it! :)			"

												After hours and hours of playing, I've changed my mind. This game is definitely worth $20. It has it's flaws but when compared to Sim City it really does shine in a way that forgives it of it's problems.=== The GOOD ===- Real traffic, real pedestrians, and their AI actually calculate's their travel all over the map. You don't have to wait in an area to see the traffic and pedestrians build up. You can zoom into a neighborhood and immediately see all the traffic. The city feels extremely lively. The masses feel real.- Beautiful game.- HUGE cities.- Lots of detail.- Great frame rate.- Satisfying.- Extremely unbalanced. But that's ok because you can use the ""Rule Editor"" in the Tools menu to change the capacity of all the vehicles, change the break down times, change how fast they are fixed in the repair shops, how many residents the city has, EVERYTHING. So you can re-balance your game however you like. - I increased the city population density by 500% and it was awesome! You need to have an extremely good PC because the game calculates each and every person's commute. I increased the capacity of trams to 200 people per tram (more realistic) and 600 people per metro train so it's more realistic and the whole game just got so much more fun. I had 2,000 people waiting at my busiest transit stations. I was so happy. It was everything sim city should have been.=== The Problems ===- My game crashes every hour. there's no auto save. But it does not crash on my brothers computer.- You can't upgrade current roads, you have to bulldoze them and when laying down the new road, if you curve or are off by 1 pixel the buildings around will be destroyed and you can't get them back.- There's no ""undo"" option. So if you accidentally destroy a building or are having trouble with rail connections (and you will a lot) you have to bulldoze everything and start over.- Trams can no longer do U-Turns on avenues like they used to.- The addition of depots is extremely limiting. ALL buses, metros, trams must start out and end at the same depot. So no more little bus routes.The team worked really hard on this game, and the assets are top notch. I feel like just 2 more years of development and this game can be fleshed out into a serious Sim City Competitor. If you have problems with the umbalanced gameplay, low vehicle capacity, short break down times, just change the stats in the Rule Editor and game on.			"

												""Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.""Mark Twain once articulated these words many moons ago, but not once did he think that such an utterance would be so applicable to a virtual transportation simulator, which touches the hearts and minds of all thouse who immerse themselves in this one of a kind experience. The question for each man to settle is not what he would do if he had means, time, influence and educational advantages; the question is what he will do with the things he has. The moment a young man ceases to dream or to bemoan his lack of opportunities and resolutely looks his conditions in the face, and resolves to change them, he lays the corner-stone of a solid and honorable success. This success came to me when I cast logic and reason aside and invested into this life changing game.I believe that the happiness of life is made up of minute fractions—the little soon-forgotten charities of a kiss, a smile, a kind look, a heartfelt compliment in the disguise of a playful raillery, and the countless other infinitesimal of pleasurable thought and genial feeling. In my case however, the perpetual light of pure joy seemed to shine upon me upon purchasing Cities in Motion 2, and I urge you to do the same. "

												I own both CiM1 and CiM2 and so far I have to say I enjoyed CiM1 a lot better.First of all let me begin by saying that CiM2 does have certain improvements over the first version, which includes:- Now you can build your own roads and expand the city;- Day/Night shift and timetable settings;- Ticket prices are now based on distance (or zones) rather than flat fare in CiM1;- More realistic graphics and city landscapes (for example now roads can be actually curly rather than in 8 directions only in CiM1).However there are many things which I do not enjoy about this game.- The game is pretty much DLC/community based. If you buy the base game you will find only 5 maps (including a tiny tutorial map) and very few vehicles. The metro, which is supposed to be the backbone of any serious city transportation system, only has 2 trains available and are pretty much the worst ones. All decent maps/vehicles come from either the community or paid DLCs. You don't get much from the base game.- Stupid depot system. Yes the vehicle depot is added in CiM2, which some people might consider it an improvement. However I find it too often that my depot becomes too full and too many scheduled departures missed.- Lack of tutorial. With so many new features added why not add a serious tutorial to explain the complicated features? CiM1 has, in my opinion, a very decent tutorial mission.- The construction of the metro is very troublesome. Maybe I'm wrong, but it's very difficult to construct an underground metro line within the city. The elevation just don't match. (In CiM2 you can adjust the elevation freely with your pageup/pagedown keys, while in CiM1 you only have 5 levels: 3 underground, ground level and elevated.) This problem is made worse by the underground depot, which I have never successfully connected to any underground line. So far 70% of my metro lines are either overhead or on the ground, and all depots are on the ground.In conclusion, while some people may cheer the new added features, I must say that I enjoyed CiM1 better than CiM2 even when I try hard to switch from 1 to 2. Would rather recommend version 1 to anyone who does not want to smash their computer and/or keyboard while playing a simulation game.			"

I don't want to have to look up a guide on exactly what trans lines to build where to be able to even play. I enjoy strategy and tycoon games, but the game just says ""Here's how to build a bus line, now go make money"".I don't feel that the game is interesting enough to memorize exactly where to build things.

Dubious after reading negative reviews, I went ahead as it has a worthwhile metascore rating..Safe to say these reviews are correct.. Its not fully in depth to get your hands around with on a starter tutorial.Thrown in making a bus station, and have to create a route, and repeat on a tram depot.. But, it doesnt give you a lowdown of ""hey this is how u correctly apply bus/tram stops, tram tracks & create a line"" - after ten mins trying to understand the tram, I gave up.. Back to cities XL, FAR more enjoyable. Spend your money on that instead- and From what I see no DLC, just free mods.			"

												This is a good simulation game to build a good infrastructure for a fities. There is a lot of problem solving going on. Couple this with good visuals, this makes an awesome simulation.However, the tutorial covers only the basics, most of the things are by trial an error. Plus, the interface is complex. There are many graphs and data that is readily available to you but this games expects you to interpret the data yourself with out much hints. It is best if the player fread up the wiki and stretegies before playing or play it a few run thru. Sometimes  the run thru will be slightly time consuming.Personally, I find this game beautiful. I really enjoy this game but this game is not for everyone and have a high learning curve.			"

												Honestly, I don't see the fun in managing the transport needs of a city. But I gave the game a shot as I wanted the trading cards...I got maybe 4-5 steps into the ""tutorial"", which wasn't intuative in the least, and just quit. The menus don't seem well laid out and remembering where every little item is makes me feel like I'd need to print out a giant poster of where every option is located under which menu and sub-menu in order to play, and that takes the fun out of a game for me.I can deal with games like SimCity or CitiesXL where I don't feel like I have no choice but to micromanage in order to play, which is the impression that this game gave me.Thankfully, I got this in a HumbleBundle, so it's a bit easier to swollow.

												Cities in Motion 2 (or just CIM2) is one of the most boring games ever created. The pretending mayor - or better, city engineer - position the player is put into is manager through a series of complex menus, which are very counter-intuitive. From there the player has to build the structures to make the city work.The point is that the city is already an existing city, with citizens that go to work and home, but without any of the infrastructures that you'll have to build. How the heck did those people manage to get around then? This is the downside of this game: there is no story in it, no reason d'être for the city to exist.I don't recommend this game. If it weren't for the steam trading cards I wouldn't have spent so much time with it. Once the 4 cards were dropped the game was uninstalled at once.			"

												I really liked the idea of this game when I started playing it: you're responsible for building a public transportation system for a metropolis that'd already created for you (cool-looking cities too).  There's an incredible amount of detail for the obsessive and careful, but something as basic and essential as building a bus line is cumbersome, and building a functioning fixed track transport like tram lines is frustrating and overly complicated.  I simply gave up after spending an hour trying to set up one tram line.  The track was always in the wrong place, you can't really drag the cursor to set up a long track line, meaning you have to build them piece by piece.  And then track connections are unreliable, particularly at intersections.  I take for granted in games like this that there's a learning curve and there's tricks you need to learn by trial and error to figure out how to do things, but considering the entire game is building a public transportation system, it should have been made easier.  Not less complex, but easier to execute.			"

How the heck did those people manage to get around then? This is the downside of this game: there is no story in it, no reason d'être for the city to exist.I don't recommend this game. If it weren't for the steam trading cards I wouldn't have spent so much time with it. Once the 4 cards were dropped the game was uninstalled at once.			"

												I really liked the idea of this game when I started playing it: you're responsible for building a public transportation system for a metropolis that'd already created for you (cool-looking cities too).  There's an incredible amount of detail for the obsessive and careful, but something as basic and essential as building a bus line is cumbersome, and building a functioning fixed track transport like tram lines is frustrating and overly complicated.  I simply gave up after spending an hour trying to set up one tram line.  The track was always in the wrong place, you can't really drag the cursor to set up a long track line, meaning you have to build them piece by piece.  And then track connections are unreliable, particularly at intersections.  I take for granted in games like this that there's a learning curve and there's tricks you need to learn by trial and error to figure out how to do things, but considering the entire game is building a public transportation system, it should have been made easier.  Not less complex, but easier to execute.			"

												Honestly, I don't see the fun in managing the transport needs of a city. But I gave the game a shot as I wanted the trading cards...I got maybe 4-5 steps into the ""tutorial"", which wasn't intuative in the least, and just quit. The menus don't seem well laid out and remembering where every little item is makes me feel like I'd need to print out a giant poster of where every option is located under which menu and sub-menu in order to play, and that takes the fun out of a game for me.I can deal with games like SimCity or CitiesXL where I don't feel like I have no choice but to micromanage in order to play, which is the impression that this game gave me.Thankfully, I got this in a HumbleBundle, so it's a bit easier to swollow. But at the $20 current price, no, I don't recommend this title.			"

												This game is a sweet and sour. CiM was somewhat a fun game but lacking a lot in comparisson to Sim City 4 which is the holy grail for this genre. However a lot of these aspects have been improved in the second version of the game. Unfortunately a lot of the aspects have gotten far worse.Lets start with the city size. What is this? Cities counting 50.000 residents with full on highrise downtown? And of course you have to downgrade the people to this size. So we have mainlines with doubledecker busses carrying 30 people every hour? This is a simulation. And the year is 2014. How is it possible that no one has come as far as SC4 with it's regional play? I mean we have games now as vast and complex as GTA 5. A city sim with that kind of size shouldn't be such a big deal.The next thing is the DLC. This is the bigggest crime comitted in the world of gaming right now. You pay 20€ for a notreallyalotmorethanashity game like this. Which includes 5 different vehicles. And then you have to buy each new vehicle? for like 1€ each? That's 20€ easily just to get to a diversity of a city with 30 bus lines and a couple of suburban rail lines.And don't even let me get started on the depots! The busses should not go back to depot after each and every run. Not even trains or trams do that! This concept should be changed!Oh! Let's also not forget the bugs and bad simulator engine which causes flooding of vehicles on lines and sudenly causes a standstill in your city. Why did I even buy this?People should really start fighting for their right to a good quality games!			"

												The first game was great, this one is not.  First there are still many issues in the game as well as bugs.  The workshops barely functions for this game (so far I've never had any of the workshop content work properly).  Theres 1 campaign, and sandbox mode.  They still haven't actually fixed much of the game, instead they continue to push out cheap addon vehicles and DLC.  No longer a fan!			"

												After playin the cities in motion beta, I was thrilled to purchase this game, even more so the second one. I've seen videos of the second one, seemed decent... Though upon first playing the game, I was ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This was a downgrad from the CIM 2011 beta that I have been playing over and over. I want my money back with the game out of my library or CIM 2011. CIM 2 deffinetly is a step back, taking out and dulling qualities that were present in the origonal. Do not buy unless you watch actual game play videos. If you want a good CIM, get the origonal.

												This review is based on my time with this games Multiplayer part, and from playing with a friend.The first hour of the game was exciting, me and my friend having a good time figuring out the basics of the game.But then it started, the crashes.. and graphical bugs starting to crawl out of the woodwork, making me unable to enjoy the game at all.Having 4-5 game crashes and graphical glitches on both the UI and gameworld during my first 1-2 hours of my time playing this game is not acceptable. When other games work perfectly fine, ruling out any issues at my end.I wish I could recommend the game, cause I really liked the concept, but the crashes and UI bugs made me lose interest in this game far too early.

As a fan of past games such as the Cities XL series and going as far back as Sim City 4, this game finally delivers the level of road customization I'd expect from a city sim.   Although more oriented towards transportation networks, that is more what I have been interested in anyways.  I am hoping the next generation fo this game includes more building models and also solve some of the few querks this game has.  Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10.0			"

												Fun game until you hit the bug and force you to replay, since reload or selling vehicles wont work.Most of the time when I play the game, there are always some buses that stuck on the track, even if u were to sell the one that's stuck the next one will stuck at the same place. If you are lucky and doesn't encounter that bug, there's another bug, apparently after a while the station refuses to send out the vehicles,I really like this game but as it's now the bug just make it frustrating, because if you want to report those bugs you have to register at paradox forum, and my experience with them aren't great either as it takes forever to just register due to the fact that after hitting the send botton it just keep loading and nothing happens....All in all, untill the bug is fixed, I do not recommended the game to anyone.Edit: Apparently it's a well known bug ""Hi, this is a known issue and unfortunately there's nothing we can do about it."". They could atleast have put it up in the description so people are aware before buying it.			"

												This is a hard game to recommend.There are people that like roleplaying games, there are people that like precision platformers, but is there really a steady audience for public transportation manager sims?...apparently there is.I would not count myself among them though.I've given this game its fair chance and finished a few maps (of which there is a very large amount by the way, including a lengthy campaign which I did not see coming), but in the end it wasn't for me.The huge amount of menus you need to navigate to successfully manage and grow your company isn't laid out very well and there are some serious pathfinding issues, especially with the boats, that really put a damper on the whole thing.I did not try the online multiplayer though, so that might be where this game shines... somehow.

												Cities in Motion 2 makes me want to cry. I've been playing the original for years now and I love that game (though I'm still yet to turn a profit). This updated version fixes the previous one's flaws in realism by adding depots and timetables, however now Cities in Motion is just a screen full of menus and graphs. This game dissappoints me because it took the relaxing first edition and made it into a business simulator. It's too complicated for me, and I would reccommend the original to people over this one. It's a dissappointment as I love Paradox and Colossal Order's games and I was ready to love this one. It just wasn't meant to be.Sadly a thumbs down from me.			"

												Where is my Review? It Disapeared even if it was a good one!Now to the game. Well I can't recomand it, after you get trough the first few hours you really start to have fun which than will crush within hours. There is no big variety of busses. The KI is pretty Stupid, for some reason on some Depots they can't decide to drive in or drive out. After you know how to work you can easily win any game. There is really not allot to do in this game.Also this game makes you whish you would have the african swallow back from simcity2000 because it maximum speed is just so slow. Also the strangest thing is, the trick to win is not to make alot money but to make just enough to pay of your loans! Yep if you wanna go anywhere in this game you just take loan after loan expanding and never ever pay it back in the playtrough because it takes so damn long time to pay it back. So I end up using nearly a million Whatever they are paying with as loan and just try to keep a positve cashflow. How Ironic!. Also the Cars break down so easily. If you don't have enough cars or trams or anything they just break constantly because it is more sensibel to trash the few busses than just let the people stay, which will they do eventuelly because the busses will break constantly. Also most city streats are not really good layed out, you can build new streets but sometimes the building will just disapear from that.It does allot of things good which I never have seen before but than again when did we ever had a city trafic game? Normaly we have games that go between cities. But I can't recomand this not if there are games like Transport Tycoon which is free novadays or Railroad Tycoon. I expecially like railroad tycoon 2. Maybe you just have trains but you have allot of different goods with midstation like the grain into the backery which produces than food and you can deliefer that to the people in the cities. Also the trains that are available are huge, so many fantastic trains and so many of them. But if you like maybe more different transportation than go and download Open TTD, it is just so awesome, so many different vehicels and actually the same as I can say to Railroad Tycoon but best of all not everything at the same time, it comes from time to time.If those features where in Cities in Motion 2 I could recomend it but as it is right now it is just not good.

												Cities in Motion 2 is like Cities in Motion, but with MOAR DLC!!!In all seriousness, thouhg, it's an RTS about maintaining a transport system in a city with limited cash and resources*. Buses, trolleybuses, trams, trains and boats will pave the way to fame for your city...'s transportation system.This game's tutorial is possibly worse than the one in Driver on the PlayStation. I can't even begin to explain where they went wrong. Seriously, just google how to play the game. Some random polish bloke could do a better job at showing people how to play the game than CiM2, which tells you to just build a metro without telling you, well, how to build the metro.Next, trying to get the vehicles going is a pisstake. I'd have an easier time keeping Chuck Norris captive using only a roll of gaffatape and  and a defunct N64. Make a line, buy vehicles, assign stops to the line, stick the vehicles to the line's depot (which by the way is mandatory) and only then are you lesss than 3 steps away from getting a line going.Once you get all of this going, and everything begins to spludge into shape, there's a beautifully crafted RTS involving transporting the masses on a train which kind of looks like a pelican bird while maintaining cash and the what nots that are needed. Sadly, though, it's overcrowded by quicly slapped together tutorials, horrid gameplay systems, and an overall unpleasant experience.The only good things I can think about mostly revolve around graphics and the effeciancy system which makes you build these systems as effeciently as possible, otherwise people will just drive or walk there.Verdict: Buy Prison Architect instead.4/10. It's not very not all that not good.PS: Also, this game is very empty on content without any DLC packs. Oh yay.**A note to Admiral Denbigh: Get this out of your wishlist. Pronto.*With the resources being cash. The only thing that really stops you in this game is how bulky your pockets are.**That's a sin of video gaming. Oh dear.			"

												If youre buying this game because you want to distance yourself from Sim City or Cities XL, this is not the game for you. The jist of this is not city building, more just building roads, bus routes, and metros. Thats all you can really do. There are lots of road types, flow control, directional control, ect. Lots of bus route planning and metro planning, but the city development portion is not there. I expected it to be like that based on what I had seen of the game, but that is not what it is. Simply, its just building roads and transportation.			"

The CiM2 is a good improvement over the CiM 1, though the UI is made a bit too complicated and not that friendly to use.  Missing also the great modding diversity as other games have.

												I have read many negative reviews about this game, but I think it's a great improvement on the first while comparing the camera angles, controls, graphics etc. Although these are all great, the only thing that is bad about this game is the design engine. While trying to join tracks for your metro system, you will constantly try and adgust it to fit perfectly in the way the game wants it to go. Then, the tram system. Trying to place a double track is a pain and has terrible intergration. The game lays it down and doesn't do it automatically. You have to manually click on every part of the road to place the tram track. Despite this negative feedback I reccomend this game more than the first because the graphics and controls are awesome and I enjoy the gameplay. Other than missing helicopters from the first, it allows you to customise the timetables, trains etc which is a great feature for someone like me who enjoys simulations. If you like graphics, controls and gameplay, get this game. If you prefer the story type of a game, get the first. If you want to improve your experience, buy the DLC! There is a pack available on {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com for you to buy this fairly cheaply. Thanks for reading, hope you have fun playing in the future!			"

												This is a very interesting game that puts the player in charge of all mass transit within a city. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but once that is understood, the gameplay is great. While balancing your budget, you have a main task that you are trying to achieve. Overall, once you have been playing around for a little bit, everything seems to fall into place, making this an enjoyable game. I do not like the fact that players are forced to BUY DLC, much like other games, that could break the bank if you are not careful. Why can developers not release a full game all at once like they used to, but instead milk the customers now for a few extra bucks for a couple, small extra features, one or two at a time?			"

												This game takes a while to get into.  It looks simple, but there's some surprising depth to it.I've found myself staring at a traffic jam, with cars piled up in one lane battling to merge at the last minute, thinking:  ""Why don't they use the lanes available?!""  Then I realized something:  Traffic engineers think the same way about us.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could build my own custom graded intersections to positive benefit.The bad part of the game is the missions.  You get missions where someone asks you to connect a building to your transit network.  If they're already covered it doesn't count, but if you just remove a stop and add it back in it counts that:  That's not fun, and it doesn't make sense.  And it'll give you missions such as ""expand the size of the city.""  These are alright, but they take too long.  Way too long. "

												I have read many negative reviews about this game, but I think it's a great improvement on the first while comparing the camera angles, controls, graphics etc. Although these are all great, the only thing that is bad about this game is the design engine. While trying to join tracks for your metro system, you will constantly try and adgust it to fit perfectly in the way the game wants it to go. Then, the tram system. Trying to place a double track is a pain and has terrible intergration. The game lays it down and doesn't do it automatically. You have to manually click on every part of the road to place the tram track. Despite this negative feedback I reccomend this game more than the first because the graphics and controls are awesome and I enjoy the gameplay. Other than missing helicopters from the first, it allows you to customise the timetables, trains etc which is a great feature for someone like me who enjoys simulations. If you like graphics, controls and gameplay, get this game. If you prefer the story type of a game, get the first. If you want to improve your experience, buy the DLC! There is a pack available on {LINK REMOVED}♥♥♥.com for you to buy this fairly cheaply. Thanks for reading, hope you have fun playing in the future!			"

												Glitchy and unstable. Game often crashes on save and corrupts the save file while overwriting. Corrupt save file is the worst thing that could ever happen to simulation game like this, so remember to save file using different name. And no, this game does not have autosave feature.Under my environment after client update, the game crashes 100% on the second save, so whenever I hit 'save', I have to quit, restart game and load the save file again to prevent data loss. Apparently there is memory leak bug while saving and when I check the task manager after saving, this game is using up 2.99 GB of RAM. Although I have 16 GB RAM installed on this system running 64-bit version of Windows 8, CiM 2 is 32-bit program, so the maximum amount of memory the game can utilize is capped around 3 GB.			"

												Well...where do I begin?  This game is surely the most detailed city simulation I've ever played.  The new features from the first game are too many to list.  The AI is much improved from the first, and very realistic.  The way in which transit systems are constructed is very flexible and easy to use.  It just makes sense.  The ability to create new roads is unbelievable; it feels like I'm playing a highway building simulator because of all the things I can do with them, even though it's a public transit simulation and it's not the main focus of the game.  I sincerely applaud the developers of this game for putting so much care into making it realistic and fun, in a time when most developers wouldn't.			"

												I enjoyed it quite a bit.  So I guess that's the ultimate standard for a review.But I'd also be doing you a disservice if I didn't also say I was extremely disappointed with the bugs and lack of polish.  It can become infuriating at times.  If you plan on playing the coop mode, just forget it.  It is so broken I dare say it doesn't work at all.   Frequent network disconnects, and a broken save system makes it too easy to corrupt and be unable to reconnect with your partner.The interface is really bad in general.  And some vital flaws with the campaign makes it lose its challenge.  Like being able to make your city just barely profitable, then leave your computer running over night one the fastest time factor and coming back to be ridiculously rich.   A simple solution here would have been putting time limits on missions, or making people become more and more upset with lack of public transportation over time, or anything really.  It just makes the rest of your efforts seem worthless.   I ended up enjoying the game more by self imposing time limits on myself. If you can overcome all that, the game has a lot of enjoyable moments.Oh, and you probably need a decent computer to run this game well without weird stuttering when panning the camera around on high settings.

												When it was published I already have played the classic CIM for a long time and thought that it probably would be as good as the old one (or better) and so I didn't wait and bought the game. However it wasn't that what I expected: It's nice that there are vehicles carrying more passengers and a better track building. But the game design isn't the best one, since it isn't as ""realistic"" as the design of the classic CIM. Moreover you have to build your transport networks in ""futuristic american"" cities which aren't  really cities (but Tutorial City :D). I hoped that you could build in NYC or Wahington, but those cities aren't in the game. It would also have been nice to be able to play scenarios in europe cities, but for it you have to buy a ectension pack which costs some money :(.			"

												Really disappointed in this game - bought recently from Bundlestars, installed and tried to run it and kept coming up with error on Windows 10 about mono library being missing.Went into the forums on Steam to see if their is a solution - only recommendation is to go to Paradox's forums and ask there.  Went there and found out the game was actually discontinued back in 2013, and so was the forums.They still have Cities Skylines forum open but CiM2 is closed and it seems they're not interested in supporting this title at all - which I have a big question - if your not supporting it why on earth are you still selling it???  If it can't run on modern OS this should be made clear in the description that it's not compatible with Windows 10.  The only thing I can see is that minimum requirements mentions XP/7/8 and 10 isn't listed, but many other games also don't list 10 as it's a new OSFrom what I can see it seems mono library is something to do with VC++ however as Windows 10 has a later edition of VC++ there isn't any way of getting it to use the older version of VC++ that this mono.dll is compatible with, so if you've upgraded to Windows 10 don't bother with this game 'cos it wont work - I'm now probably going to try and get it running on a Linux box and hopefully get it working so I wont have wasted my money.

												In it's current format I can not recomend the game as it is completely unplayable.I have recently had my eyes tested and they're above 20/20 and yet at about a foot and a half from my 27 inch screen at 4k resolution I cannot read any of the ingame text. I've tried changing to a smaller res but the font size doesn't get any better.I can find no option to make the text larger and there seems to be no response from the devs despite public outcry. Such a shame as this actually looked like it could be quiet good if I could actually play it.			"

												A game built around traffic and transporation where the traffic lights don't work and four lane roads get clogged because cars can't change lanes. A lot of the design and interface decisions in this game make no sense. I had some fun with Cities In Motion 1, which has also has some problems, but this sequel sucked the character out and replaced it with nothing interesting. It's simultaneously unchallenging and frustrating. Not worth it.			"

												The Economy of this game is ethier very real or very very broken at the start all you do is lose money since ticket sales create only small amounts of money. Another thing is if you're creating a game about public transportation the people in your city should actually need public transportation only about 1-3 people would actually ride my bus in each route.Pros -Map creation-Provides a sense of diffculty Cons-You lose that sense of diffculty rather fast not because you suceed but because its so boring-Hard ♥♥♥ economy -Busses are always late -When busses are late the depot requests more busses even though they arent needed			"

												Not a very fun game, the ""tutorial"" level offers no actual tips or hints on how to play, just a extra small city, game is basically just controlling traffic in a city, no real building, you earn money through fares. Not much to it and not much to do in it. Played campaign for a while but it just became a waiting game so it got boring fast especially when triple speed is still super slow, sand box is just as slow except you can have infinte money. Buses work great but the other modes of transport seemed to not work for me and placing roads and tracks was just a hassle, overall i wouldnt recommend this game. Yes its a game solely about transport but they have missed so many key aspects that any game should include.			"

												I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're willing to spend hours restarting your game.The learning curve is way too steep, the initial campaign (which I started with in order to get some goals) is very difficult because it starts straight away in a massive city. The map is also very deceptive as to how long it takes to get between places, what looks like a short bus route can easily be a 5 hour journey.That said, I've not yet spent hours and hours playing this, so my opinion of it may well change as I get better at the game. It could do with a better tutorial/better ramp up of difficulty in campaign mode.			"

Sounds pretty great, only the thing is, is that the vehicles you have never reach a spot on time, building buildings such as stops and tracks and depots are glitchy as hell and on top of that, youll never make money due to the stupidity of the ai vehicles. Also, riders on your buses are always complaining about the price and the tardiness of the vehicles, and there is really no way to fix that.

Extremely processor-intensive and inconsistent traffic simulation. WAY too many DLCs. No left-hand drive support (it's more important than you think). Hilariously game-breaking dynamic urbanisation mechanic. Extremely little map content. Pointless, inflexible ""campaign"" mode. Metric tons of micromanagement. More eye-pleasing cities? NEIN. And most importantly, an extremely user-hostile network construction method. No thanks to my OCD, I usually spend over 12 hours just to plan ONE perfect metro line. The lack of assistance to deal with the gridless game engine is really taxing on my rigid SC4-style urban planning skills. To be honest, I wish Colossal Order had instead tried to emulate the gameplay of the original CIM as much as possible, as well as implementing actual multiplayer support that supports third-world internet connections and properly-synchronised gameplay for once.

To be honest, I wish Colossal Order had instead tried to emulate the gameplay of the original CIM as much as possible, as well as implementing actual multiplayer support that supports third-world internet connections and properly-synchronised gameplay for once.

												I tried for hours finding out, how to manage all the tools in this game, until I realized, that it is the game, that doesnt work, not me.As an old Sim City 2000 player, I see so much potential in the game engine for a good city building game, but it only focus on vehicles and transport and even that it does so badly.A Bus needs 4 hours for 2 Kilomters, why arent you all going on foot?Cars are blocking each other, I even managed to block a whole street with two bus lines, that stacked perfectly into each other, so no one could move anymore (also no warning from the game, when that happens).I am so sad, because the game looks so good but you can do nothing with it. Maybe a good screensaver.At my last attempt I downloaded a fine sandbox world with no buildings to freebuild my own city. But again, you cant say, what the city is building. Randomly living, city and industry areas are popping out, and you cant do anything to sort and manage it.Like I said, the game is so damn pretty, but it does what it wants :(			"

												I do not recommend Cities in Motion 2 because:Roads should not dynamically readjust if they're extended, removing the buildings that had previous lined the road.  If a road is being extended, why would the existing road's path change?  Played city and transport sims a long time, not sure why this mechanic was broken.I've never played a city/transport game where I can not lay road (without deleting entire rows of buildings).There are other things, mostly ui related, that have irked me the few hours I've been playing, but the above is too much.  Almost four hours in, and I'm still having to - essentially - unlearn city and transport gameplay mechanics (i.e. laying roads) that have been around since SimCity 1.			"

												I really wanted to like this game. In fact, I gave it several different tries. It's just not a very good sim game. The cities that you start the campaign with are huge and the tutorial really doesn't help much. I would have rather started on a city the size of the tutorial city and worked my way up. The font sizes are tiny and not very easy to read and the cities are hard to work around in due to the designs. This game would have benefited from a change from super-realistc graphics to something a little more cartoon-ish. I don't need ultra-realistic to run a transportation company. I just need easy-to-work controls. Like I said, I really did want to like this game, but it's just not very fun.			"

												It's not a bad game in that it runs well, but to put it simply: it doesn't have a soul. Also the controls and UI can be confusing/difficult to use. If your really into traffic simulators give it a go. If your looking for a newer Sim City 4 like game after all the disappointment surrounding the Sim City reboot keep looking. In fact maybe give the other Paradox game coming down the pipe a look: Cities: Skylines.			"

												I  like simulation game, and I love mass transit, then this game is really in my interest. On an urbanistic level, the social class division are nice, and there is lots of detail in this game. I would be the perfect game is the dev had give some attention to the UI and the UX. For the UI, this game is terrible! It's soo annoying. Every menu, a new pop-up window appear, if closed, the remaing window doesn't reorder. I can seam picky,. but that's just on detail almong many bug. Because they are bug, they are really bad behavior and Colossal didn't fix it because it was too much money, not enought profit. And then the UX, It's quite nice to do line, and I must admit that I got pleasure planning my line. The road creation is nice, really advanced. But they miss completly the relation between time and vehicule speed. 11km can take 8 hour for tram, without traffic. What's the point? I is faster to walk. This can be ok because it's a simulation. But they included timetable. How to you want to manage ""real time""  with vehicule take a whole day to do a circuit. They is a limit to say ""it's a simulation"". Even a simulation need to be coherent.Then I think this game got really good base, and the principle is nice, but there is an evident lack of caring about the gamer. That's an unfinished game, and they offer no update. That's bad to pay for that.			"

												Cities in Motion 2 is the sequel to the popular mass transit simulation game Cities in Motion. Build, manage and lead your transportation network to provide cities with their ever changing needs. CIM2 introduces new features including multiplayer game modes, day and night cycles, timetables and dynamic cities. Building the transportation network will directly affect how the city grows. Affordable transportation brings middle class housing and work places, while more expensive and exotic choices bring high end businesses. Take advantage of many different types of vehicles including buses, trams, ferries and more. Build alone or play cooperatively with a friend. Use the newly implemented bus lanes to build efficient traffic free roadways. Tackle rush hour by managing transportation timetables and meeting the needs of the citizens.			"

												 I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation. This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice. It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of captivity.But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free. One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself in exile in his own land. So we have come here today to dramatize an shameful condition.In a sense we've come to our nation's Capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir.This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds.""But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now. This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred. We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force.The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall march ahead. We cannot turn back. There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?""We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality.We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.We can never be satisfied as long as our chlidren are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating ""for whites only.""We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream.I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations. Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells. Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality. You have been the veterans of creative suffering. Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed. Let us not wallow in the valley of despair.I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal.""I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification, that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.I have a dream today.I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.This is our hope. This is the faith that I will go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day.This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning, ""My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrims' pride, from ev			"

												A boring traffic simulator.This is not even really a traffic simulator, as it is built around public transport. You are given a pre-built city, and the task of designing bus, train and tram routes within the city for the public to use, and cater to demands. This game led on to the creation of Cities: Skylines along with the city-building element, which is good, because this element on its own is boring. The routes can sometimes break if different transport types overlap, the graphics aren't very good, and you have limited flexibility about where you can put different traffic systems.Overall, in my opinion a rather tedious game to play repeatedly.3/10			"

												did you ever buy a game, play it for 11 minutes and then decide life is too short?  That's me here on Cities in Motion 2... hate to be shallow, and if you are a fanboy this review has to irritate you, but i just got repelled by the whole thing despite wanting, in that DOS retro mode, to get into this... now what?  is it fun to micromanage which direction public transit flows?  so i recommend this game ironically because it is exactly what it is == you with infinite human longevity will enjoy the minutia of determining which way the city bus maximizes its exit flow from the city?  i admit i could have passed on sayinng anything but i almost re-downloaded this for another go and immediately remembered why i didnt reinstall this on my last PC.

												I think the game is good, but not better than CiM 1--in my opinion. The immediate reason I bought this game was very simply because of the fact that it contains multiplayer, which the first game did not. Unfortunately, this game just seems too different from the first. My very first mistake was my incompetence of reading more negative reviews. Because little did I know, all of the cities in this game are fictional. One thing I loved about Cities in Motion was that you could play in cities like Berlin, Tokyo, Frankfurt, etc. I don't like playing in fictional cities, and while you can indeed simply create your own city in the editor (or get a map off of the workshop,) that's not for me. I much prefer official things. They did release a European Cities DLC that adds Prague, Liverpool, and one German city; but I really don't want to pay more money for this. I feel that historical cities should have just been added from the start, but instead, I forsee that we'll have to either buy what should have came with the game from the start, or rely on player created historical cities (which are pretty good, actually.)Secondly, I (Remember: My opinion) dislike the drastic change with scheduling, depots, etc. I liked how simple it was in the first game. You build some bus stops, buy a bus, set up a line, and watch progress be made. Now you must work with a time schedule--which many may agree is an awesome update, but I much prefer keeping it like the first game. I at least wish there was an option to play the original way--perhaps a ""classic"" mode. If they implemented this, I would definitely switch this over to a positive and buy this for my friends.Again, that's just why I don't recommend this game. Many--if not most--will actually find this game much more improved over the first. I jumped into this game expecting the exact same thing as the first game, but alas, there's a whole new learning curve to adjust to. So to sum it up: This game is a more realistic version of the first game.I'm going to continue playing this game, as I believe I've gotten the ropes down. But boy, I sure wish the first game was multiplayer co-op.			"

												I dont like this game at all. I mean if it were closely similar to simcity I would thumbs up it. Firstly. I cant even build a tram stop right by my tram line. And its focusing only on transit as in simcity you actually build the city from the ground up. So if your going for something leaning towards a city building simulator, go for simcity. as it is more open than this game.			"

												Who needs bugged Sim City 2013? EA/Maxis, watch out!- Cities are huge (1 city in CiM2 is almost 1 region of SC)- You get money if people use your busses/trams etc.- It has a metro...- much more street options (buslane streets / tram can drive everywhere)- vehicles looks awesome- much better AI for vehicles and the Cims (Sims)- Map Editor- NO DRM- much lower price for a much better gameand and and...Of course, you can't really compare these games cause 1 is a city- and the other a transport simulation but i do cause CiM2 has much more SC style as SC itself.If you want to expand your city you just need to build some streets and the game generates some random houses. And the whole city is dynamic, that means more busses/trams/trolleys/metros/watertaxi lines you make, the more the city grows.I was already fascinated by CiM1 while ago but CiM2 is much better. Of course it still has some missing features i would like to see but i totally trust the developers cause they do what the community want. They will also publish Modding Tools for this game as it was in CiM1.CiM2 came out exactly at the right point, already see many players who totally forgot SC and play CiM2 now. Don't feed EA/Maxis anymore...Sim City 2013: 5/10Cities in Motion 2: 8/10 (if they do the features the community mentioned, what they will do definetly, it will have 9/10)			"

The menu is clunky and slow and thats terrible for a game that relays on a smooth designed menu so much.The game fells very very unpolished E.G. Many small and big bugs, Crashes every now and then on mac atleast, and I feel the devolpers have left this game for dead.Only for a very particular audience and I think you will be dissapointed if you have played the orginal Cities in Motion.My personal conclusion:This game Unposhiled, Slow, Hard to learn for new players or the series and it has given me several headachs playing this game, Im sure you find many reviews like this one.ONLY BUY IF HEAVILY SALED Write your own review if you thought this was ♥♥♥♥.

												bad game all in all. One of the main features of the game is schedule - people go to work and go back home, and roads are very busy in the morning and late afternoon. The game does simulate this, but there's a catch - a bus can take two hours to cross a block, and 8 hours to drive from one neighborhood to the next - this renders any schedule simulation impossible, and the game quite pointless.Graphics is cool, UI is bad. Building/engineering is pretty cool. Simulation-wise - big fail, don't buy.			"

												Cities in Motion 2 is much more in depth than the original game, which results in a slightly higher learning curve.  The gameplay itself is fun, as you build a mass transit system for a small town or large city.  Making the trains run on time, setting prices, and satisfying your customers all makes for a fun game.However, there are a host of bugs that I've experienced that decrease my experience in the game, specifically with additional content downloaded from the Steam workshop.  The Steam workshop is great, with alot of new maps and add-ons making the game so much better.  Unfortunately the maps tend to get buggy at times, resulting in corrupted save games, with hours of work lost.Nevertheless, the stock game itself is good, and I still recommend this game, especially if you are a fan of the SimCity series, or the original Cities in Motion, or even Tycoon games.

												This game could be good, but unfortunately isn't. There are so many bugs, stupid pathfinding, impractical UI - and authors resigned to do anything but new graphics DLC. So you can buy vehicle DLC containing five new vehicles, but these vehicles will be stuck at empty road without any reason (that's only one of many bugs).Authors resigned to improve UI, to fix bugs, and even to communicate with community. If you write ""That's lovely new vehicle"", they write ""Thank you :)"", but if you write ""Are you planning to fix the bugs?"", they write nothing. And i personally hate this approach to customers. So no - don't buy this game.			"

												So, I've played this game for a real long time, and everything works pretty good. I like that kind of ""free-style"" interchange and interstate construction concept and I tried so hard to make my cities' traffics look better, but here's the problem: the way vehicles changeing lane is the stupiest thing I've ever seen, in really life, you just go on to the road and change lane during driving, but in this game, everything changed, people change 3 or 4 lanes right after the interchange, and change 3 or 4 lanes right before detours, which makes a huge unnessasary trouble for city's traffic, which never gonna happen in the real life.Some cars just ""parked"" on the expressway or whatever interstate and blocks all the traffic, this game is so buggy.

												While it has occasional stability issues (which are often caused by the unity engine and the developer can't actually do anything about this at the moment) it is a load of fun if you like transport simulations. It entails a lot of optimization of existing lines, so if that's not your thing this probably isn't for you.It is a MASSIVE improvement over the first game though, which I already liked quite a bit, so I can only heartily recommend it!

You you like to build your own tracks for your metro? Would you like to see how releastic this game is? Would you like me to stop asking you these questions? Well if you like most of what I asked, this game is definetly for you. I love public transportation, and this game allowed me to make my own methods of transit. Of course, there are some points where you say, ""ok I'm bored,"" but when you get the extra dlcs, you won't stop playing for days! So what are you waiting for? GET YOUR COPY ALREADY!!!			"

												I've played many tycoon games. I like this game and finished the campaign for it. It's not difficult to win once you get a feel for what the different transport types can support and how to space them out to give good service(hint: try following a grid, <5 minutes round trip for any one line). It can be very relaxing, even when you're doing poorly, and there are plenty of options for setting up a complex network even without the DLC additions.I have two issues with the game:The first is that track and stop placement can be tedious and error-prone, depending on which type of transit you're working with. Although the majority of the time, you want your tram and trolley lines(which are built at street level) to either continue straight ahead or take a 90-degree bend, you have to carefully click each road segment and scroll each time, which, combined with the low visibility of these constructions, almost guarantees that you mess up and fail to link one of the segments and then have to go back and debug it when the game tells you the route can't reach a stop. There is no tool to simplify this construction phase, even though the game can adequately plan the entire route for you when you use buses on existing roads - so you may spend a LOT of time squinting and clicking. Similarly, when building underground roads or metro lines, there is no way to view through the roads, which means that when you go to add stops, you have to either work extremely hard to position the camera to see through a road, build around the road, or tear up the road and add it again. A lazy player is going to want to build only buses, watertaxis and underground metros that consciously avoid overlapping the road.The second problem is with the city growth model. To induce growth, all a player has to do is build new roads with sidewalks, and improve overall transit service. The player doesn't get any control over what types of zones appear, even though they're relevant to decisions about transit scheduling and peak service. This makes city growth feel very ""one size fits all"" - the growth is generic so you have to build generically - and since you can add roads anywhere that the terrain will fit, the simplest growth strategy is rinse-and-repeat: build a new metro line, and build roads on top of it. When I discovered this it  detracted from any sense of individual character amongst cities. Growth can be turned off, at the expense of making the game feel more like a static ""fill in the blanks"" exercise.			"

Compared to a certain other city builder, which i'd rather play and seems more easy to figure out, I'd say this was a bad buy on my end and I wouldn't recommend it.			"

Even comparing it to Simcity 5 It is arguably a better game, Cities in Motion focuses on the logistical side of people movement in an urban environment. The placement of tracks, Stations, and Depots is not glitchy at all.  You can add roads and new buildings will show up, so yes the population density goes up and you will have to expand as the city does or you can buld them.

												Maybe this is a case of mismatched expectations, but Cities in Motion 2 was really, really lame. The concept seems like it would be a decent Sim City-lite, but it's really just a... transit simulator...? Seriously? There is a cumbersome map editor which generates terrain at a snail's pace. Apparently you have to use it to start a city from scratch, or at least I couldn't find another way. And for a game that is focused mainly on transit, it's pretty ridiculous how poorly designed elements of rails and trams are. The way rails connect through intersections and turn corners is so hit and miss that you can only hope the game will cooperate. Stops give you vague information about not being connected to previous stops, but logic shows they ARE - etc etc - just a weird, empty game. Installed with some hope, uninstalled 1.5hrs later.			"

There was nothing there that hooked me into the game, and got me trying to jump to the next step.

												Cities in Motion 2 is quite an entertaining game. The maps which you work with are very realistic with great attention to detail. All the cars, people, buildings and objects run as if it was a real world. For example; if you follow a random citizen who works in the city, you'll notice that he/she will leave in the morning to head to his/her workplace in either a personal car or a pt (public transport) vehicle. He/she may either travel to a office building in the city, or possibly a factory. He/she will then come back to his/her house in the evening. You will then have to look at how you may provid public transport for the citizen. If theres one thing that should be changed, it should be the waterbuses. I do not use them often, because I find them hard to use. They are also not effective, as not as many people catch waterbuses, as they may do for trains or buses. They should instead use monorails. They would be more fun to use. If you would like monorails in the game, there is a new DLC for it. It is also currently %50 off (25/6/14).-Jimes105 (Find me on youtube!)			"

Rail gets that extra special mention for being way too fiddly to construct even the basic tracks.If you like transport sims, stick to CiM 1.			"

												Great trasnportation simulator.  I've wasted hours just playing around in the sandbox alone creating fun and new networks and infrastructure.  The AI/pathfinding can be a bit wonky sometimes, but it's still fairly good.  I do wish the map and scenario editor were a bit more user friendly though.  This games also makes me wish Paradox would take the chance at making a city simulator.  I'd honestly say if this and Simcity had a baby, it'd be my favorite simulator ever.			"

												I like this game since Cities in Motion 1. It is very hard work to build new line again and again because the system dosen't help.I need to build trolley wire and tram track everytime. It should be better if it has automatic track and line build and after I build the stop. And the Ticket price change is very time consume. Why there is no auto ticket price adjust (without mod).Some objective is too hard and nonsense.But this game is very good. I can't stop play main and custom campaign. Hope people who like sim game will like this. The idea that you can create mass transport system but can not build city is very great idea.			"

												Cities in Motion 2 is a worthy successor in all regards. The city is now 3D and can be tilted in any direction. Most importantly the city development is now dynamic so less easy to predict and it also doesn't get quickly too boring unlike the first part where you basically repeated the same steps over and over again for the same result. The interface has been improved immensely and it's quite a lot of fun to develop the transit system. On top of that CiM2 was quite cheap, compared to the first part, however it comes with its downsides.Yes, CiM2 is much cheaper (about half the price of its predecessor) however time is now being calculated in weeks and not in years anymore. As a result period vehicles have been abandoned and you are stuck with the vehicles you get from the beginning (3 busses, 2 trams, 3 trolleys, 2 waterbusses and 1 metro, as far as I remember). Everything else is DLC content, though quite surprisingly not all as expensive as with CiM1 (I probably was just lucky as everything but the bus/tram pack was on offer).CiM2 obviously - who would have expected - comes with quite some bugs (as the first one did), most importanly, it has a multiplayer, but we couldn't get it to work. We had to bypass the multiplayer problems by using Hamachi. Obviously not a solution. Many tiny but annoying issues with the interface, i.e. going underground still shows the overground streets, as a result a metro track under a street is basically unclickable. The usability suffers a bit, however has still greatly improved. Another issue seems to be the dynamic growth of the city, as sometimes three or more buildings of the same type are put right next to each other, which doesn't necessarily make sense (3 opera houses in the middle of the industrial zone). A massive improvement is the fact, that streets can be built, especially streets with bus lanes and many many more options which greatly improves the way you can build your tracks. This includes bridges and tunnels, metro now looks like the CiM1 train tracks and can be build over- and underground by simply using PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN, entrances for the stations are build automaticaly and off you go watching the people walking around like crazy popping out from one stop into the next one. Everyone who liked CiM1 should definitely get CiM2, despite the hickups and bugs and little annoyances - it's a great game. And though you might say ""damn DLC"" - the game can be played without the DLCs. Yes it's nice to have a choice of 2 metros instead of one, but in the end, you don't need it. Tell the game to send out a subway every 10mins instead of every 30min and you can compensate for the heavy usage. If you still would like to have the DLCs, check Steam for sales (only Bus DLC at the moment) or currently the other vehicles (Tram DLC, Waterbus and Trolley DLC) are cheaper in the Paradox store (however, you need to use Steam Wallet for that, which ones more makes nore sense, but they promised to make the rest of the DLCs available in Steam asap as well).

												The game concept is great and I really wanted to enjoy this game. However it is really hard to understand how the game mechanic works, and the acheivements are mostly broken, or simply more expensive to acheive than the reward. No matter how many transit stops and transit lines I put, i can never get close to the coverage requested. If my actions are not properly rewarded, then what is the point of tuning things out ?			"

												Very Interactive and enjoyable game, which breaks away from some simple concepts from similar games which give it a far more realistic feel. For instance, rather then just building routes that bring in loads of money so you can build even more lucrative routes and then get bored from having too much money to spend, you actually have to invest by borrowing money, unless you goto bed leaving it running and collect the cash in the morning! The good thing about this game is that the % effort you put in will be the % you get back, its not just a case of hitting the right parameters, game won, yay, bored now. You can take time and look at building efficient time tables and interconnecting routes to gain better returns, or just slap in some basic routes with simple tables but not gain the same return.Very realistic and replayable game that requires you to problem solve. Highly recommended.			"

SummaryMy Rating: 62/100This is a very realistic game that allows you to be in charge of creating and managing the transportation of a city. Gameplay can be quite fun and immersive, however it primarily loses marks on the poor camera controls and difficulty of management.Positive- This game's simulation aspects are very realistic.- This game has excellent elements of strategy.- There is a large amount of potential management decisions.- A large amount of DLC is available.Negative- The camera is difficult to control.- The simulation is too deep. There is too much micro-management, and it is therefore hard to manage a large amount of routes.- DLC is somewhat overpriced. "

												A complete bug-fest (Linux version): mouse input is broken, game-breaking graphical bugs after opening the options, ugly and barely readable font, and the tutorial music sounds like noise that is playing too fast. I had to use xkill to exit the game.The only thing that works is alt-tab… Too bad everything else is broken.Now *perhaps* I could make the game work by never opening the options, using keys instead of the mouse, making my eyes bleed reading that awful text, but I can’t be bothered for now… Too many problems.UPDATE: I tried again one month later while I was in a better mood:- Mouse input is still broken (you can’t rotate the map correctly with the mouse and if you try it can freeze the game, but the rest works).- I didn’t get any graphical bug this time.- The font still hard to read and blury/ugly, but it’s mostly ok.- No sound problem this time, but after a while I stopped the music anyway (it’s just some generic music).So this time I was able to *almost* finish the tutorial. Everything was fine until the last step of the tutorial: build a metro line!While all the previous steps are very well explained, this final step is not explained at all, and I haven’t been able to contruct a functional metro line even after watching the official tutorial video on youtube. I think it is possible but so far I am not ready to give a positive evaluation to this game yet… Maybe next time.			"

												This is not an exciting game. It's not a fast game. And it's not one that you can even necessarily win...You have to love trains and trams and busses to love this game. Tweaking schedules and fares on a weekly basis. Being willing to alter your entire system when you run a new line through it.In short, it's not for everyone. But if you enjoy urban planning, transit, and just watching busses roll by...this game is for you.What it does best:-Road and track tools are fluid and forgiving. You can build above or below the ground, over water, or change existing roads.-Sounds and ambience are pretty goodWhat it does less well:-Art style is pretty grey/brown. Not too nice on the eyes.-Traffic sim and pathfinding are good but not perfect. Sometimes it will bug out.-UI could be better, easier to use.I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I enjoy it for what it is - a niche simulator for a perfectionist sort of person. If that's not appealing to you then skip it. "

												Rather boring, honestly. I suppose it works for people who like economic simulations.There is almost no story at all. Hey, build up your transportation company with this starting money, make more money, expand your business, and then make more money! Yay! Further, to actually play it you have to navigate through clunky menus, and if you have poor eyesight like me you need to turn the resolution down just to be able to read what is written in the game. This means you play with poor graphics as well. The sounds are minimal; mostly, the music you hear at the start of the game is it, with occasional track switches. The biggest thing to note that works for this game is the expansion. You definitely will get a sense of your company expanding, and you can just keep playing and keep expanding for a long while. I am not sure just how much you can keep expanding, but it is a lot. If you like the gameplay, then you will like the amount of time you can sink into this.(Overall 4/10, Story 2/10, Gameplay 3/10, Graphics 4/10, Sound 4/10, Replayability 9/10)			"

												I want to recommend this game, I really do, but sadly I can't! :-(The concept is good, the basic implementation is promising, the framework is good, but the overall product just falls short of what it should be.  Worse than that, it falls short in incredibly frustrating and game-breaking ways.  There are fundamental problems with the AI which cause your transport networks to grind to a halt in highly unrealistic ways.  Basically, there's a variety of bugs in it, some subtle, others less subtle, and the net result just stops it being fun to play.The above wouldn't be so much of an issue, if Colossal Order (the developers) had not basically given up on CIM2 and moved on to their next project.  There seems to be very little hope of the problems being addressed.Reluctantly, DO NOT BUY!			"

												I got this game for free, and I'm glad I didn't actually spend any money on it.Dispite what the tags say, this isn't a city builder. Imagine making bus stops in Cities: Skylines, but the mechanics are broken. That's this game. That's the entire game.The city is already completely built. You just place some transporation spots for things like subways and buses.It's 2/3 the price of Cities: Skylines, and there's a lot more, and working, transporation features in C:S than in this, plus it's an actual city builder.Do not get. Get the other mentioned game instead It's only $10 more and it has everything this game wants to have and much more.			"

												I've become totally adicted to this game.  It allows you to totally focus on the transportation aspect of managing a city.  It features a variety of transportation options like busses, trolleys, light rail (they call them trams), metro lines, and ferries.  I've tried both campaigns and sandbox, and find the sandbox to be more enjoyable.  In the campaign, I'd get upset that it would move on just as I was starting to get the city the way I liked it.There are some klunky parts.  For example, if you want to change a street to add a lane or designate a lane as a bus lane, you have to demolish it and re-create.  Any transportation stops along that street are also demolished and removed from your routes.  You then have to re-create those as well after you're done the construction.When setting up routes initially, you determine the order of the stops.  However, if you add a stop later, the AI determines where it will go.  This is usually placed logically, but there are times that it would be nice to adjust it.Building metros can be a challenge with the underground view.  It's not possible to turn off the surface streets, and this hides parts of the metro you're trying to build.Also, as soon as you start the game for the first time, go into settings and turn on the option to scroll the map by moving the cursor to the edge.  By default, you have to use keyboard commands to move the map.  I almost gave up on the game when first playing, because this was so difficult to do.  It's a whole different game with the scroll turned on.  I'm not sure why the default is off.All in all, though, I highly recommend this game.			"

												I've played many tycoon games. I like this game and finished the campaign for it. It's not difficult to win once you get a feel for what the different transport types can support and how to space them out to give good service(hint: try following a grid, <5 minutes round trip for any one line). It can be very relaxing, even when you're doing poorly, and there are plenty of options for setting up a complex network even without the DLC additions.I have two issues with the game:The first is that track and stop placement can be tedious and error-prone, depending on which type of transit you're working with. Although the majority of the time, you want your tram and trolley lines(which are built at street level) to either continue straight ahead or take a 90-degree bend, you have to carefully click each road segment and scroll each time, which, combined with the low visibility of these constructions, almost guarantees that you mess up and fail to link one of the segments and then have to go back and debug it when the game tells you the route can't reach a stop. There is no tool to simplify this construction phase, even though the game can adequately plan the entire route for you when you use buses on existing roads - so you may spend a LOT of time squinting and clicking. Similarly, when building underground roads or metro lines, there is no way to view through the roads, which means that when you go to add stops, you have to either work extremely hard to position the camera to see through a road, build around the road, or tear up the road and add it again. A lazy player is going to want to build only buses, watertaxis and underground metros that consciously avoid overlapping the road.The second problem is with the city growth model. To induce growth, all a player has to do is build new roads with sidewalks, and improve overall transit service. The player doesn't get any control over what types of zones appear, even though they're relevant to decisions about transit scheduling and peak service. This makes city growth feel very ""one size fits all"" - the growth is generic so you have to build generically - and since you can add roads anywhere that the terrain will fit, the simplest growth strategy is rinse-and-repeat: build a new metro line, and build roads on top of it. When I discovered this it  detracted from any sense of individual character amongst cities. Growth can be turned off, at the expense of making the game feel more like a static ""fill in the blanks"" exercise.			"

It feels simplistic where it should've been complex (for example, only passengers can be transported, no mail, goods or other products/resources), and it feels overcomplex and too intricate where it should be simpler (the distribution of bus stations, for example).

												There are pros to the game: The potential for an awesome city-transport simulator is there. It is quite detailed in this respect.However, the gameplay is severely lacking. Construction can be an expensive endeavour that will leave you frustrated and wishing you'd saved. You could easily blow 50% of your (easily obtained) budget because you built something different than what you wanted. And there's no undo button, so the easiest is usually just to reload if you make a mistake during construction. This is worse if you accidentally delete something critical in the infrastructure and essentially have to start over.Transport Tycoon had more variety in transportation in one form alone, but this game requires you to buy DLC to get variety (seriously Paradox, stop it with the DLC).The campaign missions are bland. The maps are different, but the goals are essentially the same. Establish coverage. Build a number of good lines (reputation is pointless, just build something that will cover as much as possible), wait until you have more money or take out a loan, and build more lines. You don't have to think about where people are going. You just need to cover everything until you reach your goal, then move on to the next coverage mission. Growing cities is just a matter of waiting until you have enough money.Metros in this game are of the Danish variety - no one knows how to build them underground, so the most effective ends up being floating them 8-12m above the city streets. Even if you did build it underground (which is possible) you can't build stations underground, so again, just build them floating.For these reasons, I would not recommend this game, although it is a fun little game. I certainly wouldn't pay more than 2-3 euroes for it.			"

												Such a great citybuild/transport game. Significant improvement on the first, has more depth of passenger requirements than alternatives such as OpenTTD but lacks any kind of cargo transport.Absoultely love it, every passenger has a destination they want to get to, you can't just put a route down and people in the area will use it. You have to think about your network as a whole.			"

												Before played this game I only played the OpenTTD game, which is a similliar type of game, and I loved the game as well the type of mind needed to build routes and manage the traffic and beyond.Then, Cities in Motion 2, appeared in my account and, in the first game I became in love with the game. The jump from OpenTTD to CIN2, in my opinion, was a beatiful jump. CIN2 if, for me, one of the best simulators I played in my live!

												So, I picked this game up with the hope that it would be a bit like those metro scenarios from Railroad Tycoon II (which, I incidently consider the greatest game of all time). And, ultimately while I think it's good, it's not quite ever going to be a classic of the genra that Railroad Tycoon II is. In many ways the compairison is a fair one. Both games focus on transportation logistics. In the scenarios I describe, both games focus on moving passengers through an urban envrioment. That's where they start to differ. Cities in Motion 2 is zoomed in quite a bit. You have to plan your trackwork, or overhead wires block by block. You have a dozen different modes of transportation to work with, not just a station and a station radius. You plan individual trips for your vehicles on the route and you have to worry about rush hour and adding extra capacity for peak times in Cities in Motion. Where the defining unit of time is a year in Railroad Tycoon, it is a day in Cities in Motion. The sad thing is this detail is incomplete in many ways. You can't get your subways or trams to revers direction in place, for example. You can't forbid left or right turns when modifying the road work. And, unless you spring for the DLC, you only get 3 choices for each type of vehicle. The day-night cycle and rush-hour are interesting logistically, but it causes the financial model to feel weird. You might spend hours of wall time waiting for your operation to turn enough of a profit so you can expand. And the random objectives often seem to ask you to do something non-sensical, or don't even work right at all. lI'm somewhat willing to forgive these gameplay issues because I love the genra and the core gameplay does something that's very ambicious very well. It simualtes (or does a good job pretending to simulate) the movements of thousands citizens's daily lives. While traffic routing (particularly without the road building tools I described) can do some dumb thing from time to time, it mostly works very well and your public transit system fits right in with it. I like this game, and if this review sounds at all negative, it's beause it's tough being compared to what I reguard as the greatest game of all time.			"

												I've loved Cities in Motion since the first version and this second edition builds upon that with great improvements in both graphics and game-play. It features fairly in-depth management techniques dealing with running and maintaining a public transport monopoly using various types of vehicles. Thanks to the Workshop integration and dozens of third-party websites you can easily find modifications for this game to help expand it.Pros:In-depth vehicle, route and monetary controlsImproved graphicsMore flexible vehicle designs (with reference to the metro expansion)Less grid-like cities with a larger amount of freedomMod support and regular DLC releasesIncludes multi-player and co-opMaps are biggerCustom rulesetsCons:Doesn't have as big of a mod base compared to the first Cities in Motion (limited to maps almost entirely)Compared to games that inspired the genre like Transport Tycoon - it doesn't feature nearly as much detail or sizeThere are potentially more pros and cons, but these are the big ones that make or break the game. Would I recommend it? Yes - while it is missing a large portion of mod support and while it isn't that in-depth, it's still a great game that you can easily spend days playing if you're into this sort of genre.			"

												I loved Transport Tycoon Deluxe, I still do and I still play it, so I was really thrilled to play CIM 2 too, as I was told it's similar in many aspects with TTD. High expectations, higher disillusion. I'm trying to have fun playing it but so far, to no avail. CIM 2 feels soulless, unchallenging, plain dull. It feels simplistic where it should've been complex (for example, only passengers can be transported, no mail, goods or other products/resources), and it feels overcomplex and too intricate where it should be simpler (the distribution of bus stations, for example). Well, at least it comes with trading cards and rather easy to obtain achievements.			"

												Very nice gameplay; this complements the Sim City series in that it focuses more on the transit system of a city; EA's Sim City series never really even touched on very basic details of the transport system, such as specific routes and schedules; this game does this, as well as covering some other management input (in a fun way, without player needing to overly manage and micromanage operation). Incredibly addictive within hours.   Decent UI, some learning curve but not too bad, and the 3-d graphics are nice to look at. In this age, nice graphics are not hard to come by, but nice graphics with interesting gameplay is much rarer, and Cities in Motion 2 is one of these cases, and hence a real gem of a find--especially for Linux gamers. (I haven't played the first C.i.M, but read reviews which made me want to hold off; it definitely seems like they worked on all the shortcomings of its predecessor.) The install and gameplay speed are flawless and very fast; this is on a lower budget 3 year old Samsung (AMD A6 3420/integrated HD 6520--circa 2011/2012) under a 64-bit Ubuntu 14.10 operating system.

												This game is for those who love mass transits. You can build transport network any way you like, as complicated as you wish. Bear in mind that this game is totally different than SimCity. It focus is only on building transport network, while the latter is more complex - focusing on building a city and transport network.The city's growth is not static. As your transport network is growing, the city population will grow too as well as city's growth.There are some downside of this game. The day-night time span is not realistic, types of vehicle are limited in the base pack. A massive traffic jam might happen when a selfish driver (esp bus driver) blocked a road, and there are no officers to clear the road. Others downsides I find are related to my noob gameplay.Overall, I can say this game is awesome. It's not as complicated as SimCity, but you will still have the fun of watching your city grow, by improving your transport network.			"

												This game offers some improvements and (do you asy disprovements?) to its predecessor. The cities in Cities in Motion 1 are a lot better, the user interface is a lot easier to use, and it is also easier to build lines in Cities in Motion 1. Cities in Motion 2 has some improvements like more (realistic looking) vehicles like the almost exact copy of the Berlin U-Bahn H01 and also has some improvements in building subway lines. The fact that there is a schedule is also a big improvement. But it is a lot easier to build lines in CiM 1 than in CiM 2 because it seems like there is always a problem for example when I tried to place a metro track undergruond and there was nothing around it it said that there was no room. All together, I would reccomend anyone thinking about buying this game to get CiM 1.			"

Hey, build up your transportation company with this starting money, make more money, expand your business, and then make more money! Yay! Further, to actually play it you have to navigate through clunky menus, and if you have poor eyesight like me you need to turn the resolution down just to be able to read what is written in the game. This means you play with poor graphics as well. The sounds are minimal; mostly, the music you hear at the start of the game is it, with occasional track switches. The biggest thing to note that works for this game is the expansion. You definitely will get a sense of your company expanding, and you can just keep playing and keep expanding for a long while. I am not sure just how much you can keep expanding, but it is a lot. If you like the gameplay, then you will like the amount of time you can sink into this.(Overall 4/10, Story 2/10, Gameplay 3/10, Graphics 4/10, Sound 4/10, Replayability 9/10)			"

												This is a great game. Its biggest weakness is the lack of a good tutorial. When you're done with tutorial, you know about 5% of the game. Really... You are not learning anything useful. Especially if you are a player of Cities in Motion 1, you aren't learning something new with the tutorial. And that's why this game is so hard to play. The game is a big step higher in term of management and they are not teaching anything about this. So most people will give up before starting to enjoy it because they dont want to dig forever to find out how it works. And I guess this is the reason the reviews are so bad. I'll make mine a positive review even if I'm part of those disapointed people that don't understand half how the game works. Because I know it's a good game and a great step higher than Cities in motion 1. But still, I dont understand exactly how every features work and it's not making me wanna play more. This is sad. This game could have been a real blast to play if there was the appropriate tutorial to teach people how it works. That's something the dev could have upgraded. They could have get way better reviews and get more people interested into playing this game (especially now they released Cities Skyline which is a very popular and appreciated game). Come on Colossal order, give Cities in Motion 2 the tutorial it deserves!			"

												This is a quite fun managment game but it lacks a bit of deepness.  Main game mechanics works well in general, but once you discovered how to make easy money, it always a more of the same. Also it lacks basic managment tools like a view for costumer satisfaction or vehicles monitoring and stuff like that, timetables scheduling it's a bit cluncky. the campaign it's not so inspired, it's made of 12 scenarios, but they make you resume previous scenarios (for example scenario 5 makes you resume scenario 1 and continue from your last save) so if you set up a good strategy on the first scenario on a map, the following ones will end very quickly and easily.it's a good game overall but it needs a lot of refinement. this is one of those times I would like to have a button between ""recomended"" and ""not recomended"" :(			"

												It's a bit on the repetitive side, plus there are some in-game issues such as stupid traffic and customers that become unhappy far too quickly, but if you can ignore that, then what you have is a very nice combination of city simulator and transport simulator. The route building tools are very good and easy to use, there's a wide choice of vehicles, the way the city responds to what you build is also a nice addition, and for good measure, there's a great map editor built into it. 8/10			"

												A complete bug-fest (Linux version): mouse input is broken, game-breaking graphical bugs after opening the options, ugly and barely readable font, and the tutorial music sounds like noise that is playing too fast. I had to use xkill to exit the game.The only thing that works is alt-tab… Too bad everything else is broken.Now *perhaps* I could make the game work by never opening the options, using keys instead of the mouse, making my eyes bleed reading that awful text, but I can’t be bothered for now… Too many problems.UPDATE: I tried again one month later while I was in a better mood:- Mouse input is still broken (you can’t rotate the map correctly with the mouse and if you try it can freeze the game, but the rest works).- I didn’t get any graphical bug this time.- The font still hard to read and blury/ugly, but it’s mostly ok.- No sound problem this time, but after a while I stopped the music anyway (it’s just some generic music).So this time I was able to *almost* finish the tutorial. Everything was fine until the last step of the tutorial: build a metro line!While all the previous steps are very well explained, this final step is not explained at all, and I haven’t been able to contruct a functional metro line even after watching the official tutorial video on youtube. I think it is possible but so far I am not ready to give a positive evaluation to this game yet… Maybe next time.			"

												I've become totally adicted to this game.  It allows you to totally focus on the transportation aspect of managing a city.  It features a variety of transportation options like busses, trolleys, light rail (they call them trams), metro lines, and ferries.  I've tried both campaigns and sandbox, and find the sandbox to be more enjoyable.  In the campaign, I'd get upset that it would move on just as I was starting to get the city the way I liked it.There are some klunky parts.  For example, if you want to change a street to add a lane or designate a lane as a bus lane, you have to demolish it and re-create.  Any transportation stops along that street are also demolished and removed from your routes.  You then have to re-create those as well after you're done the construction.When setting up routes initially, you determine the order of the stops.  However, if you add a stop later, the AI determines where it will go.  This is usually placed logically, but there are times that it would be nice to adjust it.Building metros can be a challenge with the underground view.  It's not possible to turn off the surface streets, and this hides parts of the metro you're trying to build.Also, as soon as you start the game for the first time, go into settings and turn on the option to scroll the map by moving the cursor to the edge.  By default, you have to use keyboard commands to move the map.  I almost gave up on the game when first playing, because this was so difficult to do.  It's a whole different game with the scroll turned on.  I'm not sure why the default is off.All in all, though, I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is not an exciting game. It's not a fast game. And it's not one that you can even necessarily win...You have to love trains and trams and busses to love this game. Tweaking schedules and fares on a weekly basis. Being willing to alter your entire system when you run a new line through it.In short, it's not for everyone. But if you enjoy urban planning, transit, and just watching busses roll by...this game is for you.What it does best:-Road and track tools are fluid and forgiving. You can build above or below the ground, over water, or change existing roads.-Sounds and ambience are pretty goodWhat it does less well:-Art style is pretty grey/brown. Not too nice on the eyes.-Traffic sim and pathfinding are good but not perfect. Sometimes it will bug out.-UI could be better, easier to use.I'm giving this game a thumbs up because I enjoy it for what it is - a niche simulator for a perfectionist sort of person. If that's not appealing to you then skip it. "

												If you're enough with your city's public transport, make a city of it in the editor, and try to do it better. It's not the perfect game of public transport simulation (I think the first one was a little bit better), but it still worth a try, if you're up to these type of games.			"

												As a fan of simulation games I was interested to see how public transport simulation could be made fun and interesting.I'm still wondering since the tutorial was unhelpful, rushed and doesn't explain the game well at all - there was no option to return to a step if you didn't understand the concept and it would allow you to accidentally skip a step without completing it. The tutorial leaves steps out of the process - like building bus depots before building the bus stops themselves - leaving you to try and piece the puzzle together yourself.This game might be interesting and fun, but I'll be damned if I could get it to work.

												I don't know if I really like this game or not. Franklin speaking, I really enjoy this game when playing and building a city via the map editor. However, there're just way too many bugs (which CO doesn't admit)  and unrealistic settings that annoys me A LOT. Moreover, some features are not sold as DLCs (which means I can never perchase them), and some DLCs are too expansive to some extent.I suggest that:1. Do not buy it unless it's 75% off.2. Use a ruleset that sets private car rate to 5% or less.Noticed bugs:1. Passengers transfer between lines infinitely.2. For some maps students' unemployment rate is too high in the first hours. It then drops slowly.Annoying settings:1. Default cities are far too unrealistic.2. Building an interchange is too difficult.3. Cannot destruct part of a road.			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine  PLEASE NOTE: I recommended this game with some exceptions, overall if the game did not live up to just a tiny expectation, I would not have recommended it at all, so please read the review carefully if you are thinking of buying/playing this game Cities in Motion 2 is the sequel to the transport tycoon simulation game Cities in Motion, developed by Colossal Order, the people behind the fantastic Cities: Skylines, however Cities in Motion 2 and its predecessor, Cities in Motion, came out before Cities: Skylines and published by the strategy masters, Paradox InteractiveCities in Motion 2 is a simulation strategy game in which you run a transportation company in a few realistic countries such as Amsterdam and others such as London sold seperately through the heavy amounts of DLC. Cities in Motion 2 takes place in the modern era of transport and carries on throughout the years and you have a choice of either buses, trams, metro, ferries or helicopters and with the more money you make the more transport services you can addCities in Motion 2 is definetely not my favourite from the two games. Asthetically, the game is very displeasing. The graphics look ugly and the UI is both confusing and horrible. I would also complain about is it's game's performance. Once you add too many things, the game chugs like mad, it looks like the game couldn't handle it. Sometimes even crashing the game and losing your progress thus far. Also, the huge amounts of DLC is kind of ridiculous. Both games suffer with this surge of DLC sadlyCities in Motion 2 is definetely not my favourite one. If I had to choose between this and its predecessor, Cities in Motion, I would choose the first game. Cities in Motion 2 is a mixed bag, it feels like the developers were forced by the publisher to make a sequel after the success of the first game, and you can tell where the mistakes were madeHowever, if you played such classics as Transport Tycoon or you would like to play a game where you manage your own transport company, then Cities in Motion is the game for you! Cities in Motion 2 would only suffice for people who liked the first game RECOMMENDED :)  "

												I want to recommend this game, I really do, but sadly I can't! :-(The concept is good, the basic implementation is promising, the framework is good, but the overall product just falls short of what it should be.  Worse than that, it falls short in incredibly frustrating and game-breaking ways.  There are fundamental problems with the AI which cause your transport networks to grind to a halt in highly unrealistic ways.  Basically, there's a variety of bugs in it, some subtle, others less subtle, and the net result just stops it being fun to play.The above wouldn't be so much of an issue, if Colossal Order (the developers) had not basically given up on CIM2 and moved on to their next project.  There seems to be very little hope of the problems being addressed.Reluctantly, DO NOT BUY!			"

But, I wish that you could add airports, and make short hops from airfield to airfield, and a bunch of planes for sale, with the first one being the Cessna 208 Grand Caravan. Then you proceed to better planes, with the next one being the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, next the Britten-Norman Trislander, the DHC-8 for real long hops, and then a CRJ100. All range in capacity, from 10 to 50 pax.			"

												You play the god of traffic in this non-stop, testosterone fueled, manventure. It starts out in a bustling town in the middle of a larger bustling town, where it becomes your job to create bus lines for the pitiful busless mortals. From there you probably create more buses and roads and theme parks and eventually a road to heaven itself. This game has thrills. It's got spills. And it most likely has the necessary skills to pay the bills. Until you lose interest and quit almost as soon as it's done installing. Recomended.			"
