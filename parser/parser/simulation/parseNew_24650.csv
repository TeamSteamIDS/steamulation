												I like this game, people dont probably read the fact that this is a STAND ALONE PACK, so why buy it if its a pack. The trainz standalone packs dont have surveyor.			"

												Very nice stand-alone DLC pack. If you are thinking of buying this then make sure you have one of the base games. Even though this works without it you will have more fun with the base game as you can open the surveyor and put other trains in to make your own scenarios.None the less the scenarios built in are good but you should think about getting the base game for a more complete Trainz experience.

												I have to admit, I was excited when this came out, but it didn't last long.As I am a fan of diesel trains, this DLC had an extreme lack of diesel traction sessions for the 60s, where you could carry out the session using a diesel locomotive instead of a diesel.The lack of a tutorial on how to use the steam locomotives puts me at a disadvantage compared to people who have used steam locomotives on trainz on a regular basis, and due to the lack of diesel sessions.I also found out that many locmotives didn't have the right headcodes for their class, some session objectives were ambigious or pointless to carry out, you could also say a few trains were missing break vans.You could also say yards were full of ghosts they were so empty. Literally nearly every yard would be almost completely empty except for the cars that you're going to pick up and use for your service.I'm only going to recommend this to people who like steam locomotives more then diesel, and don't care aobut displaying a false headcode, that doesn't really need to modify the sessions in any way.Oh, that's another thing, editing sessions, normally if I don't like something, I'd make a fix for it which I'd like a bit more, then save it under a new game, with S&C, it doesn't let me do that.I don't know, I feel that I had more fun out of the Hawes Junction Demo compared to this... But if you're a fan of steam trains, try it, see what you think...			"

												Light version of Trainz 12 simulator but this one somehow feels more complete even with graphics with lesser quality. It's still very much a complete simulator and that's why you as a trains simulation fan should get it.Since it's a Train Sim, it get's the usual two thumbs up. https://steamcommunity.com/groups/FloatingOnAir "
