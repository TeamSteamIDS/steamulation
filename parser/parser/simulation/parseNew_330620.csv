												I saw this game on sale, and thought ""What the heck, I'll go for it."" I had an hour before I had to leave for work, so I thought I'd give it a go. Over an hour later, I casually looked at the clock and grabbed my coat and RAN out the door, racing in traffic to get to work on time before I was late. Barely made it with a few seconds to spare. I'm normally a guy who shows up early just because better safe than sorry.So I would say this game is pretty spot on. Think of a group of raiders, in any game you could play. World of Warcraft, Ever Quest, Final Fantasy Online - just to name a few. Then, take that group, and think of them as real people (we all know that you picture some guy playing a chick character just to stare at pixel booty all day) - Not to say they aren't, but the perception of most people is to look at who they are, and assume everyone else is a robot or just some random nobody.This game is full of comedy - Everything from ""Killalot talks about his political views"" to a person ""Afking in the middle of combat to check his email"" - And will remind you of what really happens. I love when I tell a tank to take over agro, and the tank (who is better geared and more able to do so) cannot pull agro off the first tank. I love when a mage just happens for wander into creature range and gets attacked wildly. I love when the healers forget to heal because they think a tank is good, and start to dps, letting the poor tank die because the fight required a focused heal at specific times. Just like in real MMOs.This game is easily one of the more addictive games, and as my first day playing, it has already caused me to come close to being late to work AND caused me to rush home just to try to see how far I can make it after the fact.

												I really like the game so far. It's been interesting to get into the mindset of a kind of manegement position for these ""raids"" rather than being able to control anybody's actions directly. This game has so far been full of funny moments (when a healer alt tabs right before finishing a big heal is great).I have a couple of critisisms though.Switching tanks mid-fight seems so difficult as to not even be worth the effort. One of my warriors has one extra piece of gear over my secondary tank and that seems to be enough for him to take aggro on every creature even if he isn't attacking it. Only being able to make one command in a turn can get really brutal when things go wrong (if more than one player decides to switch roles, for example). It would be nice to be able to do more in a given turn even if it was only sometimes.I'd like to see more flavor in the combat log, more classes, more raid abilaties, more everything I guess. I'm excited to see if this game continues to grow after release.This game is more than worth the price of entry and I will be spending a lot more time with it in the future.			"

												It's A Wipe is worth the money for the nostalgia factor, but most of the game feels relatively spartan in features or gameplay. Generally, the game consists of managing a sitcom-version of a guild raiding party in an indirect fashion with breaks in between; additional characters or other amusing features that one think to find in a game about managing a guild are absent. Further, the game is quickly over -- there seems to be only 7-8 raids -- and some of the mechanics really need some work, particularly infighting over loot. This can make the game frustrating and the game itself seems to have relatively little replayability; which is odd given that the overall concept of the game, if developed, could provide for a fascinating guild management game. The problem with that is that the game not developed sufficiently; it is, as stated, feature light.With that said, it's five dollars and I had trouble not liking it. For that price you get what you might expect. I would tepidly recommend the game and hope the developer fleshes out the features of it.Pros:-Interesting concept.-Nostalgia.-Humor is good.-Good framework for a game; seems easily developed.Cons:-Relatively thin in gameplay depth; feature light.-Sometimes frustrating.-Sometimes boring in some fights; cannot manage one's own character.-The UI is really very ugly.

Or the guy blasting his horrible soundtrack in vent.  Or the guy asking to post DPS charts after every fight. Or all the males hitting on the one and only semi attractive female player.

												UPDATE November 13th 2015:  It has been over a month.  (10/9 - 11/13) That I have been talking with the maker(s?) of this game discussing the issues I'm having getting it to run, and finally we got it working with the new ""debugging-"" patch they added to the games betas list.Let that sink in for a moment, these people love their game so much, and are so willing to get it to work for those that purchase it, that even a single person like myself is worth that much time and effort.Now, once I've actually played the game a bit, I'll be reviewing it properly, but whether the game itself is good or bad now is now irrelivant to me; fun is subjective and will change from person to person, but dev(s) willing to put this much effort into fixing a game for you, that's the kind of work that deserves to be paid for.Original Review: I don't want to give it a negative review because the developer has been nice so far; but the game simply won't run, even on different video cards.  Will happily change when/if I ever get it working because it looks like a blast.  :(			"

												Fun game for the price.  Battles require thought after the early dungeons are out of the way, and keeping everyone happy about loot is a bit of a challenge.  Your raid's strength grows noticeably over time, and some of the character actions can be amusingly nostalgic if you've ever raided in an MMO (like someone going link dead, or a mage deciding to tank).  MMO experience can help you get a handle on strategy quickly, but I don't think it's a requirement to enjoy the game.The character quirks don't impact the gameplay too much, so luck isn't a huge factor.  Fights boil down to managing the raid strategy (like DPS, healing, and tanking priorities) and figuring out boss patterns.  I'm impressed by how well the game simulates the raid management experience (""WHY DID YOU DRINK THAT POTION INSTEAD OF HEALING THE TANK?!?"") without getting bogged down in micromanagement.  Fights can drag on at times, but hey, they're raids.  They do that.It would be great if characters had more personality, or if raid groups could be bigger, or if character abilities were more varied.  For the price, though, those aren't complaints - just wishes for a DLC/sequel someday.			"

												Look at my time played. I have enjoyed every hour I've spent on this game.The developer is great about listening to the community, fixing bugs as they're found in a timely manner.I STRONGLY RECOMMEND not reading a guide before playing, since a major part of the gameplay is figuring out each boss' mechanics on your own.Essentially, IAW is a puzzle with multiple solutions. Which raiders you recruit, your group's class spread, balancing loot distribution, everything plays a part in your success, and there isn't a single 'right' answer. Do you take two rogues for higher damage, but knowing morale might suffer from loot disputes? Do you take two wizards, knowing they'll deal high damage, but have trouble swapping targets? Do you take a bard for the buffs or replace them with a different class?I've played through the game with a lot of different spreads. Once with three warriors, once with only one, sometimes I take a bard, sometimes I don't. Once I took two druids, even. It's all about figuring out how the group will interact and doing what you can to keep things balanced.Plus the humor is great. It's amusing even if you don't get the references, but is pretty great if you do.So microwave a burrito, turn on voice chat and grab the rum: It's time to go raiding.			"

												If you used to do raiding in MMORPG's (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing games) then you may enjoy this game.You assume the role as a guild leader and make plans on how to deal with bosses that you encounter, but it isn't as easy as that. You can make plans on how you want to deal with the boss that turn, but your tank might tab out to read his email or your healer might decide he wants to tank.A varity of things can happen while your raiding and you also have to keep your raiders happy else they will leave you to join another guild including with any loot you happen to have gave them in past runs.Overall it is a great game for it's price but I'd recommend playing it while watching a movie or playing another game as it is fairly slow and your raiders are doing all the work you just give them the command on what to do.

												Exellent background game.As an active game, it's a wipe is like a real mmorpg raid, its fun to do one raid once or twice after that its on farm status and then you get bored with it, but you have to do it anyway to be strong enough to advance.This is where play in window comes along, you can do lot of things on background, play browser games, watch movies so on, and just click orders for next turn time to time and let your raiders do the fight.Is it worth it ?   With that price yes, the game is unique experience but its not a piece of art, you won't play it over and over just either bit or once trough. "

												Have you ever wanted to play an MMO that...isn't an MMO?Have you ever wanted to raid more often than weekly resets allow?Have you ever wanted to lead nine other raiders with their heads up their butt?If so, then It's A Wipe is for you. It's basically a non-Blizzard, non-MMO, WoW. Give your raid orders, and watch them screw them up disturbingly often. (Your own character never screws up, so I highly suggest you be a warrior tank, so you don't derp and lose aggro, killing the entire raid.)Warning: The game assumes a high amount of MMO raid experience. Non-MMO players will likely be confused.			"

												This game scratched an itch I hadnt felt in nearly 10 years. If you raided in vanilla wow you will probably already understand most of the boss mechanics and get all of the in jokes, This game is an accurate representation of what it was like to raid in vanilla wow when nobody had a clue what they were doing. Dps crying over tank trinkets - Check!Healers going AFK mid fight to get food - Check!Mages suddenly wanting to tank - Check!People discussing political issues mid fight - Check!Honestly, I had a days worth of fun from this game, Ill probably play it again sometime for that nostalgic feeling, its definately worth the money. I would definately pay full price for a fully developed game like this, the idea is brilliant.			"

												Wow, does this bring back memories of leading my guild through WoW raids! Such a great game! Would love if gear would show up on your guys-also maybe a master loot list for each boss, but this game is great as is without those things. Best 5 dollars I've spent on a game in a long while. I'm playing this game over DAI right now lol.If you are against the idea of mirco managing your group, this game is not for you. If you want to simply sit and pew pew without trying to find any boss pattern (you know how WoW is now) this is not for you. If you remember the old school raiding, where it actually took a few wipes to learn what you needed, this game is fun. I wish we had a little more meat on the bone, but hopefully that will follow in DLC's or in user-generated content. A+ from me, great game			"

												For £3.99 this game is a steal. I task you to find something else to do for only £3.99 that will keep you busy for hours.You can't even buy a pint for that for christ sakes.While I've only really just started playing the game I'm blown away by all the features and immensly fun gameplay, despite my rogues squabaling over gear! Sure its not going for any graphical awards, but its quirky and reminicent of an age of Pc gaming when it was at its finest. I've played WoW and messed around with other MMO's but never really had to time or commitment to put into actually raiding with other people, this game gives me a taster of this experience with none of the hasle. Despite what other people may say I think the game does have replayabilty, not only because of the increasing difficulties but also because there are several ways and raid composits that the player can employ to defeat raids.I sincerly hope the developers of this wonderful game continue to produce new content, including other members to recruit and new raids to explore. I will certainly be keeping my eyes peeled, and I hope others will be too in supporting the game.I have but one quivel with the game, and that is the text font and the lack of guidance in the tutorial - that being said I got to grips with it easy enough, I just think it could do with a little more highlighting the things that are happening or forcing you to use some of the many raid commands to change tactics or healing targets during a raid.Right, now I'm going to go see if i can stop Medic from spouting his political views whilst I'm raiding!

Crappy Graphics.  Cheesy Music.  Wouldn't change a thing!2) The raids actually feel like raids - you have to figure out their mechanics and set up your team accordingly.3) The raid members whine, stand in the fire, goof off, and go link dead ...  so real to form4) This game is a substantial nod to a very popular Level 0-60 MMORPG.  Not mentioning any names :)For the game's price - I would classify it in the ""High Value"" category and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has ever done a raid in the older MMORPGs. "

												For a cheaper Indie game, this Game shows alot of promise - The devs just need to sort out a handful of minor issues, such as the obvious issue when trying to swop out tanks (it doesn't seem to work yet) and the fact that the guildies all seem to be a whiney bunch of *****s that want to quit as soon as you give one item to another player - the battle log also can sometimes pop up covering a whole set of commands down the left side with no close button.If you are expecting a die hard world of warcraft style game from a guild leader point of view, then you're not going to get it from this... at least yet... but if you're looking for a quick and casual fun click about then you can't go wrong.If I can make a recommendation i think the devs should give players the ability to create their own raids for others or themselves, and perhaps have the ability to create custom guildies instead of the repetitive list of whingy players in the list? - didn't see these options, so I apologise if they are there already			"

												Absorbing game that pretty much does what it says on the box. At first it can seem pretty bland and the graphics and sound aren't exactly a treat to the senses but persevere through the early stages and you will find that the tactics aren't as samey and straightforward as the early stages might lead you to believe. Be warned that there are easier instances to fight than the third one - you can fight in anything that isnt greyed out and there is no set order. Just like in real life raids you will have to grind some areas to gear up your raiders before progressing. Whilst the ""in"" jokes aren't exactly funny they do add a little flavour.

												This could have been a neat ""tongue-in-cheek"" approach to a management game. It is, however, not. The game is so poorly put together that it hurts to play. The whole experience begs to be excused by the fact that it's a ""joke game"", But the joke stops being funny after the first fight, then there is only frustration left. If I got paid 10$ every hour for playing this, I would say no in a heartbeat. If it was free, I would feel robbed. Paying for it? I will regret it forever. Give it a miss, folks.The whole premise of leading a guild is also flawed. This game only focuses on the annoying parts of leading a guild. There is no feeling of achievement after completing a raid, just a list of items to distribute, none of which have any appearance or or quality indication on them. At the end of a raid, all you get is some numbers that you give to a member of the raid, and all the others get mad, which removes the want for more gear. There is no reason to wish for progression because the reward is just more grief.Besides getting the feel of the position of raid leader completely wrong, the game is also relentlessly boring. There is no automization whatsoever, like there would be in a good raid group. If a raid is easy, the raid leader does nothing. here, no matter how easy the boss/trash you're at is, you still have to command every single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ turn, which means you just sit there for 10 minutes clicking the same 2 buttons after you know you've allready won. Even turning up the combat speed to ""ludicrous"" it is still slow as balls, every turn taking way longer than it should. It all adds up to being incredibly boring. If the game nailed the essence of leading a raid, the responsibility, the challenge, the strategic overview needed, and the amazing feeling of accomplishment after finally downing a boss, this would have been a really interesting experience. As it stands though, it's all just annoying. TL;DR: It's boring and lame and it sucks. do not buy			"

												Honestly i can't say this is a particularly good game. for some people the raid management joke will strike a chord and they will have a laugh, but overall there isn't much here, hence the price. That said, i think massive respect needs to be shown to the devs who are still supporting their product long after release unlike so many how just dump half finished or broken products onto steam. Hopefully this will be a great learning experiance for them and lead to them producing more in the future, the games industry needs more devs like this.			"

												A surprisingly nifty little game, especially if you've ever been a raidboss or guildmaster for an MMO before.  A mix of strategy and social management with enough little jokes to keep me always smiling.  There are plenty of cheap games that are not worth $5.  This game is well worth the value and more. "

												I ran guilds in both Everquest and World of Warcraft for a total of about 4 years all combined. My ""thing"" was to take a bunch of ragtag newbs, start them at the bottom, and see how far they could get if organized properly. I was quite successful and built several ""uber"" guilds this way.This game doesn't quite capture that experience. The main things it is shorn of are cameraderie and discipline, which also happen to be the key human elements to making a successful guild.In this game, every person who doesn't get a drop that they could potentially use gets upset about it every time. In my guilds, anyone who behaved that way got shown the door, swiftly and unceremoniously. In this game, no matter what you do, some of your raiders wander off and do stupid things with surprising frequency. In my guilds, anyone who proved to be a loose cannon - you guessed it - got shown the door.The rules were that on raid time I expected soldiers, and people could be as loose as they pleased outside of raids, but while the group was together everyone had to have the utmost respect for everyone else's time.In this game I couldn't show anybody the door, because the roster of available players was so limited, and all those players came with the same flaws, so replacing someone doesn't help.Nor could you give specific advice to any players to make them better.Nor can you make a long term plan for individual players' development (a key reason why I was successful as a GM) so they didn't freak out when a usable drop went to someone else.In this game, nobody is ever happy to see a drop go to someone else; at best, they are neutral. In the real thing, good players are very happy to watch the guild as a whole improve even if their own character doesn't see new pixels every raid.In this game, your numbers go up but your raiders don't actually get better at raiding. In the real deal, the more people practice the faster and sharper they get.There are a lot of other facets of GMing that this game doesn't bother to capture at all, but are important factors in the real thing. Players taking extended breaks then coming back. Dealing with groups of friends whose primary loyalty is to each other so they become a package deal. Husband/wife pairs and the impact of marital dynamics on the group. The child prodigies who despite being much younger than other players are so talented that you can't pass them up as raiders. There are a wide variety of player archetypes but only a tiny few are represented in this game, and even then they do not differ that much from each other. The game makes feeble attempts at modeling some of this but it's really half-hearted and not at all realistic.As a MMO guild/raid leader, player availability was often the biggest challenge - who out of our key players can't make this raid? How do I substitute/adapt to those players missing? Do I need to find another player of the same class to replace a needed character ability, even if I'm taking a chance on someone new, or can I substitute with other classes from among more trusted players? If our best isn't available, do I aim for a lesser raid to bring others up to speed? The absence of that factor is important, because it impacts other decisions. Do I stack my main tank first or distribute more evenly? Do I give the best loot to the best players, or the ones who show up most often, or the ones I expect to be around for the longest period of time, or just to the people who play the best on that particular raid? Each priority creates a different incentive to players, and players in turn react in a wide variety of ways to each type of incentive. So... let me wrap this up. What this game is, is a good *prototype* of a guild management game. It's a prototype that needs to be developed by people with experience managing guilds, needs to have a much much deeper and more varied pool of players to work with, needs models of player development (including self-development), needs models of ""real life"" impact on player availability and guild dynamics, and other elements that, without which, you aren't really getting a good simulation of the real thing.This game should give you a few hours of enjoyment as you figure it out and before you realize how sharp the limitations are. If that's enough for your few bucks, go for it.In the end I cannot recommend the game as I think it fails its main mission of simulating what it is like to run a raiding guild. Wish rather than an explicit thumbs down I could give it a thumb kind of wagging to the side hoping to go up but lacking the willpower. "

												I would thumbs up this game but for what seems to be a game-breaking bug. You cannot control which tank tanks the enemies. Despite there being a Tank screen where you set up who tanks what, *and* a Tank Switch command once the raid starts, it does nothing, and the tank that the enemies decide to attack will be killed because of this. Shame.EDIT: Dev reponded within hours of my review and fixed this bug. Impressive!			"

												There are a few things to like and a few things not to like.If you are someone who has put a lot of time into being a Guildmaster or at least helping run a guild there is a lot of tounge in cheek humour here to enjoy but one thing I quickly realised is that the annoying parts of this game are the same as the annoying parts of being a guildmaster. So while there is a little fun to be had it quickly becomes a little tedious and repetitive.Another issue is that the combat is very basic. Imagine Final Fantasy Style turn based gameplay but gameplay you only control via orders. Now while this sort of replicated being a raid leader the simplicty of the combat coupled with that fact you dont actually have a character yourself you are almost a guild manager watching over another players shoulder means that it kind of falls a little flat.The low rez graphics do not help. I am sure the hand drawn artwork could have been scanned into the game at higher rez.There is def some potential here and its not awful for the price by any means but I feel a few tweaks could make this a fantastic little management style game.For a video look at the first 15 minutes of the game please check out my video below.http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/literal-first-play/141217_its-wipe-literal-first-play "

												An entertaining concept that will (briefly) tickle you with nostalgia, but falls short as an actual game. Before you dismiss this simply because it's a negative review - take note of the hours played on positive reviews. 2 hours here. 4 hours there. I personally want more out of the games I play, hence the downvote.The primary draw of this game - the campy feeling that you're raiding with MMO players - is disappointingly shallow as far as content/depth/replayability. Seeing one of your healers AFK because of a ""Bathroom emergency caused by too many Hot Pockets"" is amusing the first time you see it, but not the third time it happens in the same raid. I progressed quickly from ""Haha! That is SO World of Warcraft!"" to ""Ah, that one again."" The game does well capturing the annoying and tedious aspects of raid/guild management (attention-starved guildies, loot jealousy) - so well that dealing with these issues feels like  the actual chores that they are and not much else. With the charming ""MMO personality"" aspect exhausted almost immediately, I was left with only a game of a game that quickly became boring. Fights are slow, the loot system is underwhelming, and the mechanics can at once feel sparse and clunky - there is apparently no taunt ability for tanks, so the best way for your main tank to drop threat seems to be spending your entire turn switching him to a DPS spec, then back to tank, then when you want your pimrary tank to regain threat, you put your off-tank to DPS, then your off-tank to tank. If it sounds tedious or clumsy, that's because it is.It's not so much that it isn't worth $5, it's that there are many other games that deserve your money more than this one.			"

												Fairly decent game for £4, however there's a number of weak points that really need work - There aren't any new people to recruit as you progress, it's always the same new/useless people ~ Trinkets upset most people (even +threat trinkets upset the Healer that didn't get it) ~ Abilities can only be used once per fight (ie 3 people can Battle Rez, you only get one BR per fight though) ~ There's no auto-save after each fight, I just spent over 30mins clearing through a dungeon, the game randomly crashed and the loot from the first 3 fights was lost. All in all, it's worth your money just for the novelty value, but don't expect anything amazing.			"

												As a RL ML and GM of a guild I would like to point out a large amount of issues with the way the personalities and moral is done. Most raiders are happy if bosses are downed and loot is gained, the amount of moral never goes up due to actually finishing a raid in this game while not getting loot drops moral a significant amount while gaining loot gives barely anything to compensate for the amount lost. an example is 3 of the same type in a group  3 of the same item drop one for each of them but as i have to give each one the loot the first person has a moral boost of +2 the other 2 get negative moral if they need the item as well  ( one of my guys got -14 moral due to this ) then you give the next one their item they get +2 the first person does not change and the third gets another -2 finally when given his item he gets a +2  so in the end im left with negative moral on  a person when all 3 should have gotten a +2.  in my case I had one with -12. To the makers of this game please code things a bit better I do not know if you actually have raided for a long period of time or just decided to mock up a game that mimics raiding, It is done well but the moral part is a big bad one to have in there as you do.TLDR the moral is crap downing raids and getting loot should be huge bonus  to off set moral loss to no loot.

												The game, on paper, is a fantastic idea. However, the game just isn't very well executed. It's clunky, slow, and the UI is frustrating most of the time. My guild mates get demoralized all the time for no reason. I guess that may be intentional, but I've never enountered anyone that becomes more unhappy with a guild for no reason other than time goes by in my raiding days. I dunno, I think I just don't like the way it was implemented. If the developer takes this idea and moves it to an engine that doesn't suck, and improves the general gameplay and UI in a sequel, this would be a great game and I'd be one of the first to buy it. Oh, and also gives us different raid size options like 10/25/40, that would be awesome.			"

												While my steam profile doesn't show much time played, I've sunk in around 60 hours pre-steam.So you always wished that your raiding guild in WoW/EQ/EQ2/SWtoR/GW/GW2/Whatever really had less people you had to deal with, and left you more in control of loot/tactics/etc?  Well theres good news!It's A Wipe is a tongue in cheek (and sometimes outlandishly silly) guild management/turn based strat game where you 'hire' the guildies of your dreams and tackle raid after raid.  Each stage divies up some epic gear (and your guildmates whine when they don't get the phat lewtz).While the guild management side can get quite irritating, especially if guild moral drops too much due to a lack of progression or decent loot drops, the overall game feels pretty much like a real MMO's raiding, only without the whole subscription fee's, annoying raid time brackets, trash mobs, and other issues in said games previously mentioned.Pros:-You get to tailor your guild to your own play style-Classes each have easy to understand mechanics-Random chance AI causes interesting side effects in combat (can also be a con from time to time)-Funny encounters, Pimping orcs?  Why the hell not?-Stupidly low specs required to run said game-Some replay value if you really really like achievements.  Like really like them.  Alot.Cons:-Classes can feel kinda blended-AI could be better on wizards and clerics on which spell to cast at which time-Healing order can sometimes glitch causing tanks to not get healed very well, thus a wipe-Random events can sometimes cause important spells/abilities to not fire in a round.  While this is intended, and basicaly emulates idiots screwwing around in the source material, it's just as annoying here as it is in those games.-Graphics could use a mild tuneup, but considering the overall cost, not to mention obviously small team... not an issue personally.Would I recommend this game?  Hell yes, even with it's faults it's good for a laugh, and most of the game isn't too hard, just a nice slow grind up in gear/dungeon difficulty.Pink Horde Rules.  That is all.			"

												I would like to see a better graphics engine to support this game. The current one works but I feel I should be playing it on Facebook or an app on my Kindle. As many have already stated, if you have been in a hardcore progressive guild in any MMO this game is very similar in offering the complex problems of keeping people happy to ""raid"" with you. ( The whole GM simulator concept is great!) I have kicked 3 or so for fear they would bring down my guild and in the end they have all got pissy and left anyways. Dont buy this game for the graphics, you will be disappointed. Buy this game if you have ""been there done that"" in MMOs and tried to keep a guild progressing and have hit these various speed bumps that the game offers you.			"

YouTube™ Video: It's A Wipe Gameplay : MMO Guild Management Simulator 

			Views: 2,045		

			This is an MMO guild management simulator called It's A Wipe. Here's a bit of gameplay, and a bit of a review. Great for getting that MMO taste, without committing a year of your life.		

Full text/photos here: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-wipe/MMORPGs aren’t a booming genre like they once were. The glory days of raiding have passed, and though you can still find it if you look, I believe most people have noticed the time and money-sink that they usually turn into. Sometimes I do miss those days, I spent 7 years in World of Warcraft, so it’s hard not to look back fondly… There were some great PvP moments that make me wish I had been youtubing back then, but overall the stress of not getting that drop you “need” detracts a lot from the pure joy of the game. This is what makes It’s A Wipe so ingenious… You still get to enjoy the feeling of an MMO-raid, but you aren’t going to rip your hair out if something for your class doesn’t drop this week. Herding around your team of 10 to try and defeat a raid boss is harder than it sounds, because even though you’re supposed to be in control, this simulates a real life raid by having people go AFK to check their emails… Sometimes missing a heal when it’s most critical. Obviously the humor is there, the concept is interesting… But there are some fundamental flaws, let’s get into that while we look at It’s A Wipe.There are nine dungeons in this game, which all offer their own challenges, and will require different strategies to beat. If you’re used to managing a raid, setting up primary tanks and target order shouldn’t be a problem. The real strategy comes once the fight starts, since you’ll need to realize when to change gears before it’s too late. Did the mob get an early crit? Spam heals before he drops the tank! Is AoE damage overpowering your casters? Maybe it’s time to retreat and bring an extra druid. The recruiting system has potential, but could use some work. Currently the only skill I’ve seen is Battle Rez, and the only perks Alchemy and Herbalism (both serving the same function). It could get quite interesting to have a few more in the mix, or even just a couple guys with no skills having upgraded gear available. As it stands though, sorta bare-bones. There are a variety of items in the shop, but you’ll honestly only be buying the potions unless you don’t feel bad about embezzling guild money into a sweet mount or companion pet, which isn’t visible.Besides fighting the bosses, and people derping away in combat, you will be forced to worry about the morale of your guild. You know that rogue that you dragged through three dungeons? Well, he’s upset about the one drop he didn’t get, so he’s decided to leave the guild. I know, I know… It was you that geared him up. I’m sure you’ll have no problem gearing up another one right? Riiiight? Well, yes I do. Even the players who say they don’t care about loot under the personality tab secretly care deep down. Some days you will need to while away some hours chatting with your guild members, listening to their problems, and boosting their morale… This will upset guild members who “demand attention” under the personality tab, though. The entire game presents an intricate balance that I find quite intriguing, and quite difficult… Even on the “normal” setting. But then, when was a raid (or guild management) ever supposed to be easy?On the downside, there is very little actual gameplay to speak of. It’s a great game for when I don’t want to really “play” a video game… But don’t feel like vegging out on Netflix either. You set up the roles for the guild, and unless something goes terribly you’ll usually just be clicking “Stick With The Plan”. The humor isn’t engaging enough to hold me during EVERY round of combat, so sometimes people will change roles or switch rows without my noticing… Easily leading to a wipe if not corrected. The art style, while nice-looking, is not animated in any way, nor are any upgrades reflected on the character model aside from increasing their stats. It’s an interesting game that lacks a few key fundamentals during execution. The raids are well-designed though, and switching up classes between playthroughs offers some nice replayability. It can certainly scratch that itch I didn’t remember I had, but there is lots of room for improvement, and while it won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, the price is low enough that I’d say it’s worth giving it a chance.Summary: A MMO guild-management strategy game with plenty of potential.Final Score: 6/10 for raid designs and replayability. 8/10 with more perks/abilites.

												Feels like it was finished to quickly; a good idea just not exectued as well as it should have been.Worth the money? yes and no, if you like to micro manage things then sure but you could also just get the game Adventure manager and get basically everything this game has to offer but with better ways to make the characters train and improve with level and gear. With chances of death and so on.This game is about as mentioned running a guild in a EQ or WOW like world; you need tanks 2 of em, you need clerics that are single target healers 2 of em, 2 rogues because melee dps is quick and steady, 1 wizard for single target nukes, 1 mage for minor aoe dmg for those fights where it actually helps to make their healers target something beside themselves; (note I have not seen any real other reason to have a Mage than this healer interruption like effect) and 1 druid for the buff spells they have and their tiny aoe heal and 1 bard (bard is a light dps melee fighter that can give mana, hp, accuracy, damage to melee or spells randomly each round) I played it on RP mode which is hard setting (mainly because I am an roleplayer) and I managed to deal with a few raids. The annoying thing is the various personalities and how things are put up, you have those that do not like loot; but they still suffer moral damage for not getting loot but only gain 1 morality for getting it. This makes you forced to chat with them, and this makes you unable to raid.This is one of the reasons I think it is lacking somethings to be a finished product.-note what follows is suggestions to fix the game with some information about the game-There should be phases to each dayPhase 1 , 2 , 3Phase one: The GM (You) speaks to a team member, send team members out to train proffessions like alchemy, herbalist ect upPhase Two: The Raid it selfPhase Three:  As Phase 1.This would let you control better the various personalities of the guild and not hope to recruit Hard core raiders that are loot hungry because those are the personalities you want in the game.Also making guildies train various proffessions would make better for ensuring potions in the raid, perhaps had a blacksmith and enchanter skill as well for more effects and so on, but so far I have only seen herbalisem and Alchemy.SecondLoot list: after killing a boss there are no loot list of what you are getting, you get 1 and 1 item delivered to divide out among characters and it makes it harder to keep some personalities happy. If you got a weapon rogues and warriors can use, a shield only warriors can use a plate warriors can use, then it would be better if you knew all 3 items before starting to hand it out. As you hand out various items the others that do not get something, or get passed over for loot more than once get more unhappy.I know this game is about maintaing a guild for laughs and giggles while fighting hard bosses (which isnt that hard if you have ever raided in a mmo since you know what you need) The fights are also meh, I would like more Final fantasy like control over the various classes for this game to be good.Instead you must each turn choose what they should do which is 70% of the time: Stick to the plan aka they do what they are meant to do; tanks tank, dps dps and healers heal. Thats really hard! oh my gawd thats stressful.the other 30% is mainly change roles or rows. The NPC in your guild might suddenly DPS mage decide he wants to tank, or healers wants to DPS. so then you change their roles again and swoosh they suddenly do their job again, the other times is they wander forward or backward and you must change their rows. Now Hug the boss and dont stand in the fire are also ways to move your people out of boss attacks and so on, but is not really that much of an challange.No in all fairness the game was not done well, it could have been so much better.With a Final fantasy Fight - Ability - Item option with each character, the GM commands between turns to make them move, change roles ect. More Options to gear up characters with skills like blacksmthing, phases during the day before raiding.... there are ton of options to make this game fun. As it is now? A mess of mediocer mess that is a shadow of what it could have been.			"

												Crappy flash game that leaves much to be desired. It has a cool concept, but the inability to plan for fight phases makes the entire point of the game moot. It also doesn't help that no matter what you do, everyone is a loot ♥♥♥♥♥, despite lacking the personality trait. A tanking trinket drops? Good ♥♥♥♥ing luck keeping your healer from raging for not getting it. You gave a DPS upgrade to your undergeared rogue? don't worry, every other person on the table will throw a ♥♥♥♥♥ fit and lose morale despite the ""congratz.""To top it off, the music is terrible and the sound effects sound like the person who made this never bothered to look for decent stock sounds. Did I mention it looks like a flash game?			"

YouTube™ Video: Should You Buy It's a Wipe? A 3 Minute Simulation Review 

			Views: 668		

			Ever raided in a raiding guild? Well now you can have the experience of running a WoW guild of your own with It's a Wipe.		

As a person who played MMOs at a pretty competitive level there are so many things I think could be added to this game that would make it deeper and funnier.However,The game is excellent.  You will get 30-40 hours out of a $5 purchase, how often does that happen?  There are many ways to play, many difficulty levels and so many opportunities for replay.  Don't be scared away by the RPG Maker graphics, the game has some depth to it.			"

												Painfully slow, even at 'ludicrous speed'. Want to try a new tactic? It's going to be ten minutes before you get back to your boss fight. Yes, even in this raid simulator you have trash mobs.A good idea poorly executed.			"

												Simple in design and gameplay. It's A Wipe is a pretty faithful simulation, of what being in guild is like in a MMO.However there isn't nearly as much drama. Also all the decisions are in your hands. While the game is entertaining. People who are familiar with MMO culture will probably get the most smiles and fun out of this game. I would LOVE to see this on a tablet or mobile. Think it would excel in that market.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

			I played MMO's for more then a decade of my life. Joining guilds, leading guilds, being lieutenants in guilds. Needless to say anyone who has played MMO's knows about two things. Drama and Raiding!		

I hope you enjoy!Martyr			"

												TLDR; I played for 20 minutes and got a chuckle out of it.  But not a four dollar chuckle.  Refunded.Taking the night off gives everyone a point of morale.  I would think if you had seriously dedicated players this would cause a morale drop.Talking to one person for the night increases morale for that one person, but decreases more morale when you add up the penalties for all other characters.  And I didn't recruit any drama queens either, based on character descriptions.Lots of useless raid commands you will never use, that are there just as a joke.  Switch Tank command doesn't seem to do anything when I use it.  If it takes time or a dice roll, there is no indication.  Just nothing happens, and the tank who I wanted to switch out is mowed down.After 20 minutes, obviously long-term strategy is to take 2 each of warriors, clerics, druids, wizards, thieves.  You can then alternate drops and hopefully keep people happy.  Take a nights off when you have to, to give +1 morale to everyone.Game is too boring to continue playing.  What little enjoyment can be had from this game, is eclipsed by the enjoyment that can be had by playing a better game. "

												Pros: - A great way to learn some fundamentals of running a guild. Places you in charge of distributing loot, recruiting new members, and leading your guild through progressively harder fights that will cause you to wipe if you don't adapt your strategy,- You will appreciate how the game is presented and the references shown if you happen to play MMOs (especially World of Warcraft). - The price tag. At $4.99 you can't really go wrong. You can purchase the game merely for nostalgia purposes and still feel satisfied.Cons:- The classes that characters are presented in It's A Wipe feel somewhat restricted and specialized. While this makes the game easier to play and manage it can make playing the game seem too simple (If you're a Rogue you can only single target damage. If you're a Mage you can only AoE damage, ect.)-  While the overview for each guild mates' personality and needs is a nice feature, the social interaction amoung guild mates is lacking.There is no interpersonal aspect between the guild master and his guild mates other then some reoccuring flavor text that happens during the raid itself. The social part of managing a guild is just as important, if not more important, then the raiding itself. Having a relationship and knowing each guildie is something that simply can not be done through the automated skip sequences shown in game.Overall the game for me personally has been a great return on my purchase. Its a wonderful time passer as it doesn't require you to stare at the screen. You can do other things while it plays in the background without fear of messing up too bad (for the most part). I would love to see a more fleshed out game (with a more fleshed out price tag to compensate) that had more complexity. The game has very strong potential as a starting point for a much more involved adventure/manager/socialsim game.Tl;drThe game is priced appropriately for the content it contains. Although features may seem lacking and it can be repetitive at times, it is a must have purchase for anyone who has Raided in MMOs and wants a light hearted, nostalgic strategy game to play on the side.

												I hate to be that guy, but the game is simply lacking in the guild simulation category too much for me to give it a positive reveiw.Don't get me wrong, it's still worth five dollars, and no more, but it fails to capture the true sense of guild interaction. I remember during my MMORPG days (long behind me) watching the chat while frustrated people waited for the cleric or tank to return from picking up fast food, or the absolute rage that would occur when someone with a terrible connection went link dead in the middle of a boss fight. This game tries to simulate that, but it does so poorly. For example, when Healzaur's cat walks across the keyboard, they miss a turn. When Sir Killzalot runs out to get a burrito, he misses a turn. When MagicMan goes link dead, he misses a turn. That's it, that's all that happens, when it would be easy to have each event do something differently. Cat walks across keyboard? Hit/Heal/Attack wrong monster/player. Leaving for a burrito? Takes longer than a few minutes, that should be a few turns right there. Goes link dead? Leaves the raid indefinitely, but dosn't take any damage. That's the raiding I remember, but sadly this game dosn't even take it that far.The social aspects are also lacking. When Burninator and Sing-a-long discuss politics, it should have an effect on their morale, but it does nothing. It's just pointless flavor text that reminds me it could do something, but doesn't, especially given the odd morale system in this game. The fact that your guildies are selfish arses when it comes to handing out loot is a plus, but will sometimes leave you scratching when your head when taking something for guild funds does nothing for player morale, but giving an item to a player its best suited for causes a drop in morale across the board. Then there are the times when people are feeling neglected, even when you just spent the whole night talking to them, and everyone else is getting upset you won't talk to them, like you're the only conversationalist on the planet or something.Again, I'm not someone who cares about graphics, and the game is worth about what is being asked for it, but if your looking to recapture that sense of leading a guild to disaster because raiders and responsibility rarely mix, you sadly won't find it here.

												The developer of the game ""Its a Wipe"" has banned me from accesing their support forums in Steam, since I reported a bug, where its game constanly closes when Steam updates the game, or when Steam updates itself. I didnt use any type of bad words or offense. Instead of talking to me to try to solve the issue, they have just permanently banned me with the comment: ""idiocy"". I am really surprised about how its possible these type of  people are managing a game and a support forum with such actions, without worrying about their users and game bugs. Im sorry but now I am going to develop the same game in pure HTML5 for free for all, with a lot more features. Next time they will think two times before abusing its power with a non sense ban for a customer who just wanted to know a way to fix an issue.By the way, about the game, I really like it and the idea behind it and I think it would be worth it if there were real support with clever people which really helps its users. The game concept is good, and however the graphics are a bit clunky or poor, they feel nice for what it is, a game made from an independant game studio. The Menu however is one of the worst part of the game and you feel totally lost once you begin the game. The musik is also horrible and repetitive and I ended up disabling it and listening to my own. The characters balance is good, however it needs some tweaks for some classes and bosses. The overall impression is that its a good game and a good idea, but it still needs a lot of improvements and a lot to be added to the final game. I would really recommend it if there wasnt such type of non sense support and developers who bans you after submitting an issue.			"

												I have been waiting for them to fix an extremeley annoying and simple ui bug where if you click the use item button in  town one of the arrows stays on screen. And causes the game to crash if you accidently click it during a fight. Which is really easy to do. It is utterly infuriating and their failure to patch it shows utter incompetence on the part of the devs in my honest opinion.			"
