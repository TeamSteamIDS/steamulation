												Silent Service and Silent Service II are among my all-time favorite PC games. In my opinion these are still the best submarine simulation games I have played. They have the right mix of simulation and playability to give you the feel of being in crontrol of a sub without some of the minute details that make some sub sims unplayable. For instance, you don't need to worry about running aground and sinking when you are on the big map, though you do need to keep an eye on your fuel tank. These games date back to the early days of computer gaming. The first copy of Silent Service which I owned ran on a 5.25"" floppy disk in one floppy drive with the DOS OS running from a similar floppy in the other floppydrive, for in those days hard drives were still unknown. Windows had not been invented yet and there was no such thing as a computer mouse. A lot has changed since those days, but these games are still very enjoyable if you are able to go through the learning process. There is no tutorial such as we know tutorials in modern games. Back in those days the operating manual was the tutorial and you learned the game by reading the manual and trial-and-error. For those who, like myself, played this game many years ago and remember it well, you can skip to the back of the manual and refresh your memory on the keyboard controls and be back stalking convoys with very little time practicing to refresh your skills. For those new to the game, it is well worth spending some time to look through the manual and at least skim some of the basics. A thorough read will give you some very useful information that will help you get up to speed faster once you begin play. I was not able to get the game manual link in Steam to work, but you will find .pdf files containing the English and German versions of the original game manuals in the installation directory once you have downloaded the game. On my PC running Windows 8.1 the path for the SS2 English game manual is ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Silent Service 2\Manual (English).pdf"" Good hunting, Commander.			"

												Compared to today's graphic's it's not in the same field, but for those who can see past this it is truly a submainers dream game.			"

												Not sure what is with the stupid ""reviews"" that this game isn't updated or ported, or doesn't run on modern systems. It's the original game exactly as it was. You'd have to be blind to buy this thinking it was anything else. Also, as it's on DOSBOX it runs on anything. You can even copy the files to your mobile phone and play it, or whatever.			"

												For those who say the keyboard controls don't work: There are a few keys that are different from what's listed in the manual. For the F1-12 keys, you have to hold the fn button while you press them. LIkewise, press alt + a to toggle animation (in an ambush on multiple warships or when evading multiple depth charges, the animation will quickly ♥♥♥♥ with your program, so.) and alt +s to toggle slow speed/save game. As far as I can tell all other keys work as described in the manual. The full manual is available here but even if it weren't, you can find the PDF online. Another tip: at the startup screen, choose NO joystick and NO digitized speech. According to an old forum post I found that was written years ago, there's some line of code that makes the digitized speech come out like unintelligible buzzing. Or, if you're literate in that sort of thing, you could go tweak the code and report back here how you did it. :DI first played this game as a kid at my friend's house. His parents were cooler than mine, so they had a computer and I didn't. Now that I actually know about submarine tactics and geometry, I can enjoy this game as it was meant to be enjoyed. I had been playing on a DOSbox simulator with a 5"" window, but with this port I can make full use of my 27"" iMac. Woohoo!Caveat: as noted by a previous reviewer, the game description on Steam is that of the original game packaging. There are not any new targets or scenarios added in the ported version. I'm pretty sure the ""new targets and scenarios"" are relative to SS1. Whatever you saw in the 90s is what's in this port. If you want a submarine simulator that mimics the challenges of submarine warfare as closely as possible, this is your game. SS2 is all about meticulous ambush tactics, with no arcade-style nonsense.			"

												A seriously good sub sim if you can get past the old graphics, though personally i love the pixel graphics. it has it all - historical scenarios, random ones, war patrols, full careers and as you go on a patrol you are updated as historical events occur in the theatre. The challenge to get a good firing solution is a great and tense and if you get it wrong then you end up missing the whole convoy or worse have destroyers, torpedo boats and cruisers bearing on you, relentless in their use of depth charges circling as you play a waiting game or try to find the brief window of opportunity to slip away under the thermal layer if its there. I have died many times trying to attack a convoy but it just makes me want to keep trying. My review for silent service 1 would be much the same, this one has better graphics. The only shame is that the dosbox emulation being used for some reason cannot emulate the digitized speech, so you have sound and music but now digitized voices echoing the action			"

												LOOOK! It's an old Game, but a beeutiey! Bought DEARLY, in an era of i.b.m,, ( I.B.M. WITHOUT Steroids). Consoles were withering, after much Success, in the Ei8ghties, and a bugeoning Legacy of Mouse, Joystick, Graphic SURFACE experience, and Pixels, was there for those with the Money. So S.S.II. options are somewhat to be considered. At least Steam offers options, that may only allow ""'best fit "" , particularilly for those that complain about the Price.NO!!!! I'sa no lover of the BUY - as -  you - RENT, in lieu of genuine ownership of a game, that hopefully has ""BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY"" for decent generational duration, that exists only in ""THUNDERSTORM "" clouds.ENJOY this reasonably Crafted, best Re-Incarnated Rendition of .........WE LUCKY we Get!

												The close up scenes of this game really appeal to me. The retro aesthetic of the early nineties and the soundblaster-era music really hits my nostalgic vibes. But comandeering a submarine in this game involves looking down at pixels in a top down view of a sea map and having a bunch of knobs that you can only interact with by pressing keyboard shortcuts. And to make any sense of those you need to spend an inordinate amount of time memorizing the manual or printing it, nothing is intuitive and in the end it makes even the most boring walking simulator or the most chore-like grindy games that were released recently seem like a streamlined joyride. If you remember how to play this game from having played it before i could maybe understand the appeal but for any newcomers this is mostly a bundle hoarder item and a collectors item only. Others should avoid cluttering their library with this as it has little to no entertainment value and is mostly a museum piece.			"

												Let me start off by saying I love old games and used to spend many hours on my Nintendo playing the original Silent Service which was amazing.  When I saw this in the Steam store on sale I said ""why not?""  Well, I wish I still had that $6.00 in my pocket.  Where to start... The game is basically unplayable.  I assume there have been no modifications done to this game to make it user friendly since its release, but for the price they could have at least overhauled the controls to make the game manageable.  Nothing here is intuitive and the manual I found online is not much help either. I guess the only people that I can really reccomend this game to are the ones that might have played it on the PC in the early 90's and still have fond memories.  Even then I caution this game is garbage in its current form and could stand to even get some mouse support.  PASS ON THIS TITLE AND GO WITH A DIFFERENT SUB SIMULATOR...ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN THIS.			"

												Worse game ever, how frustration and worthless.  Posted to Steam really sucks. Controls (if you can call it that , is that it sucks) , visuals are nothing but dots on a screen where Nintendo Entertainment System puts this to shame. Do not buy this game. I got it cheap on G  2  A , cheap and wish I could return the key for my money back. You can't even use steams normal F12 overlay to show how badly this game sucks with screenshots. No intro music, game style layout sucks, if I could beat someone in the face for stealing, I would beat that bass ted that uploaded this game to steam instead. Do ..... Not ....... Purchase .......unless you want to waste your money. I'm really disappointed as I thought I was going to have fun as I did on Atari and NES systems, and Silent Service 1 was my favorite. Grrrrrrr!
