Early Access Review
								Vector Thrust, the so called ""fan-made spiritual successor"" to Ace Combat and the Airforce Delta series. I've been keeping an eye on this 3D cel-shaded arcade-action flight shooter, developed by 'timeSymmetry' since it first appeared on web back in 2011 and I've playing the game since the early alpha was released on Desura back in 2012.	I must say it's really challenging for a game, the A.I. is brutal, sly and can be totally unpredictable at times which is what I need in a game these days. But don't let that put you off. If the player can do something it's highly likely and most probable that the fiendishly smart A.I. can do it too. The game mechanic's are what I would consider ""Sim-Lite"" in certain areas, like the very extensive electronic warfare mechanic's and can be very arcade-ish at times much like in Ace Combat.	The game features a large and still expanding collection of high quality modelled aircraft, surface craft and weaponry. The many game modes tend keep me from getting bored or stressed, for an example if I get stuck in a Campaign, I'd go jump into Quick Action mode to break up the pace and try something new. And here is where I do my rundown of what I've played so far of the pre-Early Access build, which is due to be released some time on Steam's Early Access platform and I must say I'm really liking many of the improvements done to the game so far.	Quick Mission mode is good but it became a bit repetitive after a few matches due to the same style of missions appearing. I don't know if it's the seed generator or whatever generates the missions but it could do with a tweak or two, in my opinion.	How I see it Battle Scenario mode is for practising and testing your own custom missions which you can create via the built in Editors, but I had trouble loading some old mission files I created during the alpha, though I managed to get them working eventually, I had to tweak a few things in the config files.	Arcade mode wasn't available to play in the pre-EA build so I can't comment on that, But I've heard some interesting idea's on what that might entail. Now Skirmish mode is where I found myself playing a lot of. The amount of Mutators, rules and other options you can chose from which are highly funny at times and give nods to other franchises which have clearly influenced TimeS, will keep you highly entertained for hours to come.	Now Challenge Mode is where you go to unlock the vast majority of base game's aircraft by completing a series of ever increasing challenging missions for that particularly aircraft family you wish to use. I'm liking the Challenge Mode aircraft tree, it reminds me of what you would typically see in a RTS or RPG game. I would of preferred it if the missions were a bit more unique like TimeS originally planned back in the early alpha, But due to lack of manpower and time it's an understandable sacrifice.	I haven't had a chance to try multiplayer yet, it should be noted however that the game uses Steamworks for the multiplayer and it isn't included in the main Early Access branch of the game. It's part of a sub branch under the Steam Beta Properties Tab and once selected the Steam Client downloads a patch to activate the multiplayer components. Though every time I selected multiplayer no one turned up in the lobby. I don't know if that was due to the lack of online beta testers at the time or other factors at play.	The Profile menu does what you expect. It keeps tabs on your play time, stats, performance and in game accolades which you gain by achieving certain tasks in certain game modes. There is also over 150 or so Steam Achievements to acquire for those who are into that sort of thing.	The game options are fairly modifiable. There's the typical stuff you would expect of a 3 dimensional game. The Display options so far allow the use of a wide range of resolutions with V-sync and Anti-aliasing available up to 8x sampling. There's various texture and model detail levels ranging from very low to very high. Other graphical options include Bloom, Glow and Radial Blur which is typical of a Ogre Engine based game. The artistic style of Vector Thrust is in the form of three dimensional cel-shading, which in my opinion adds a unique flair to the game without TimeS needing to focus too much on texture quality, least to say he's done an amazing job with them so far. So far I'm guessing for people who aren't too fond of the cel-shading, modders will probably create realistic texture packs some time in the future to cater to their needs.	Some quick thoughts on the background music, voice acting and sound effects. Well first things first, that air raid siren in the Main Theme blending with the female vocals. That alone sends chills down my spine. The intro has a sense of urgency to it, the rolling drums and beats convey that there may be some hope at the end of whatever conflict that the player will find him/herself in. Some of the other themes are pretty good too. One of my favourites is without a doubt is a musical piece called Evan's Theme which has some classical piano work which I find relaxing. One thing I've noticed a lot of though is the early alpha music and sounds are showing their age when played alongside the new musical pieces and sound effects. I can definitely say I'm looking forward to the rest of Jose Pavli's soundtrack.	The audio options menu allows you to change the various sound options ranging from Master to SFX, environmental and BMG. The sound effects of this game are fairly typical of this genre of game. Lots of bleeps, warning sirens, explosions and the occasional sound of Dakka. The voice acting of this game is a bit lacking but it's forgiven due to it been a produced by an independent developer and that there is more important things for TimeS to focus on like the game mechanics. There is however radio chatter options which you can use which change the voice modulation mechanic built into the game what the A.I. uses to make up for the lack of voice actors.	The control options allow the player to fully remap all the controls. The player can either use a keyboard and mouse combo, a Windows compatible HOTAS or a Microsoft compatible control pad. My preferred method of input is a wired MS-360 controller due to my familiarity with Ace Combat. The HUD colour palette and camera position can be changed to suit the player preferences. It should be noted however there is other options for the you to choose from in the options config file.	During missions there is a Command Menu which you can pull up and navigate using the number keys on the keyboard mid-flight, there's no need to pause the game or such. The Command Menu allows you inform your wingmen if you have any that is, what tactics, formations and weapons to use during the sortie. There is also options which do various things to your own aircraft too, like the ability to switch off your engine mid-flight and disable the Angle of Attack limiter.	Overall I could go on and on about the game, but the things I enjoy most about Vector Thrust is the open aspect of the game and the ability to change it to your hearts content. The ability to modify everything at will within a few hours of practice is a very tempting thing indeed. And with a few weeks of the game coming out on Desura there was a large collection of mods ranging from aircraft skins, to cosmetic changes to the HUD, even original aircraft designed by 3D modeller's. So imagine what the community will be able to do with Steam Workshop support if TimeS thinks of integrating it into the game. People say the sky's the limit, well in the case of VT the sky is just the beginning!			"

Early Access Review
								Vector Thrust is an arcade dogfighting game similar to the likes of HAWX and Ace Combat but with cel-shaded graphics. Its fast paced combat combined with the hundreds of unlockable planes makes this game extremely fun but it has many flaws in its current Early Access stage. Please note, this review is structured differently due to the amount of stuff I have to talk about.Graphics and Appearance:The graphics and appearance of this game are a bit hit and miss (mainly miss), thankfully it doesn't subtract from how good the game is too much and hopefully these things will be fixed soon.+The planes look absolutely awesome in the cel shaded style of the game as do enemy vehicles and turrets.+The sky and water in this game are pretty damn beautiful (see screenshot)


Vector ThrustÂ 
A Screenshot of Vector Thrust
By: Kemo




-The textures of the maps are absolutely terrible, they are very low resolution and are particularly bad to look at when flying close to the ground. Textures of airports (because they aren't actually 3D) are also bad and look like they're just 2D images pulled from Google Earth-Particle effects are also pretty bad, explosions created by destroyed aircraft are very small and disappear completely after two or three seconds, plane's don't have noticeable vapour trails.-Lens flare is also bad, it's pretty much just a grey ring on your screen which really does not look nice.-This game has no cockpit view which is absolutely ridiculous considering the type of game it is.-Flares aren't very bright and are difficult to see.-The game's UI is only visible when looking straight ahead.Gameplay and Replayability:Gameplay is where this game really excels, the combat is near perfect and with so much to do it's difficult to get bored of this game without pouring a considerable amount of time into it.+Fast paced combat +Many different enemy types, ranging from drones to the Stratofortress (that's a B52 for those who don't know)+Each plane that you can fly in the game does something particularly well making different planes suited to different missions+While the campaign is short (and pretty dull) the main game mode is 'Challenges' where you take part in different challenges, ranging from shooting down balloons with your forward mounted gun or bombing enemy tents, to unlock the literally hundreds of planes that this game has. You start off with a few of the families, such as the F-104 and as you progress through each family of planes you unlock more families to do challenges for such as the F4, F6 and F16 families.+Vector Thrust has an incredibly powerful editor which allows you to create your own scenarios to play yourself or to share with others.-While the game has multiplayer it's difficult to find a match unless you have friends to play it with due to multiplayer being in the beta branch and the small number of players on the game.-Takeoffs and Landings aren't in the game (yet?).Sound:As with Graphics and Appearance, Sound in this game is pretty hit and miss.+The roar of the engines on the planes is great +The sounds of your weapons firing are good-The voice acting is pretty awful (credit where credit's due it was just one guy using a voice changer for all of the characters in the game).-The noise for you locking on to a target is very similar to the missle alert which can be confusing at times.Menus, Controls and Options:+I played with the default (slightly tweaked, we'll get to that) control scheme for an XBOX360 controller which worked great apart from the fact that it didn't have flares mapped to it which I had to do myself, apart from that I thought the controls were extremely good and the planes themselves were very responsive.+This game has a lot of options, it has everything you would expect graphically but it also lets you choose the colours of your UI, what measurement system you would like to use and more.+The menus are simple and easy to use.-The menus can't be navigated using a controller.Things Worth a Mention:+The development team are very active in the forums which is always nice to see.-This game contains quite a few typos/spelling mistakes which I found quite frustrating.Verdict:9 for fans of similar games7 for people new to this kind of gameDespite it's flaws this is an arcade dogfighting game superior even to the HAWX series (HAWX 2 being one of my all time favourite games) BUT due to its numerous flaws this game might not be as enjoyable for people new to this type of this game (hence the two scores). Whether you're new to arcade flight simulators or you're a veteran of the HAWX or Ace Combat games I would strongly recommend this game.El K.			"

												This is a good game and there is lot to do to keep you interested. Especially if you are a fan of the old school Ace Combat or even Deadly Skies series.But it's still something that should belong in Early Access. There are quite a few significant bugs in the game and a good amount of content is unfinished. For example you will face bugs in the Campaign that stops you progressing along with runtime errors during cutscenes that force you to redo an entire mission, and several challenges are either bugged or incomplete. As others have said it's a decent buy when it's around 70% off but I cannot honestly recommend this game at full price due to the gamebreaking bugs and unfinished content.			"

								It's rough, to be sure, but for an alpha it's solid and the groundwork is definitely there.These guys wear their Ace Combat influence on their sleeve, which is great seeing as Project Aces gave up on that when the PS2 went out of fashion.  Even in its alpha state, this is the best Ace Combat-style (which is to say, arcadey flight sim) game on Steam.No, H.A.W.X., I haven't forgotten about you.  You either, Assault Horizon.  Both of you, go to your rooms.  You're being schooled by an indie, probably working with a total budget equal to what you spend on coffee.			"

												I bought this game long before it ever came to early access. I was looking for a decent Ace Combat clone for the PC. This is not it.Flying feels almost innertialess, and as long as the plane remains upright, The plane doesn't have the tremors of a normal plane that has wind acting on it, and instead stays perfectly steady. Neither combat or flying feel particularly fun. The developer decided what Ace Combat lacked was realism and sought to make the fifty or so missles your aircraft carries perform more like real missiles. However, the end result is that they perform more like rockets and even a slight incline will cause the missiles to miss.Not only is it not fun to fly or fight in this game, the game takes place over almost featureless terrain. The first mission features a crater in an otherwise perfectly flat desert. The dialogue in the mission give the impression that the crater was created by a bomb; however, why someone would use a nuke or superweapon to attack a featureless desert is beyond me.Lastly, the voice acting is bad: genuinely bad. The quality varies wildly between actors as does the clarity and volume level. The music is better, if unmemorable, but seems to be poorly used and paced.I know it was a small development team, and likely the work of passion of a small team of programmers, but the game seeks to emulate a style of story that requires comptentences that this team simply did not have. I cannot, in good concience, recommend that you buy this game.			"

												I really wish I could give this game a positive score, ideally this is an ace combat style game for PC with a touch of realism added on top of it, but this doesnât seem the case, so letâs see all the issues that in my opinion the game has.First of all the missiles: missiles in vector trust are next to useless, all of them seem to point to an imaginary target behind the enemy aircraft instead of at the aircraft itself, for the so called rear quarter missiles, or in front of the enemy aircraft for modern all-aspect missiles.While itâs true that I havenât tested every single missile in the game, which has a vast arsenal of weaponry, just seeing the R-73 not behaving like it should in a game that is supposedly something a bit more than plain arcade is not a pleasant sight. On top of this the game locking system is clunky, cycling all the targets in the area instead of giving priority to the ones near your aiming point is a severe drawback in close dogfights or against large amounts of ground forces, as it makes AA targeting rather difficult.Overall you are better off using the guns on your planes rather than missiles; these are both more accurate and more damaging.Secondly, the planes: Vector Thrust offers a vast array of planes and this would be a good thing if there werenât some odd decisions in their lineup, a lot of them are either made up versions or obscure prototypes. It would be good if planes like the Mig-25 and 31, Tornado, Eurofighter, Harrier and F-18 werenât missing from the game. Instead we get stuff like the Lampyridae, a prototype German stealth fighter that didnât get past the mockup phase, XF-10, a prototype from the 50ies, and a plethora of fictional version for almost all aircraft in the game.All of this coupled with the total lack of a cockpit view (there is only third person, virtual cockpit and cinematic mode) makes the vast plane array a weak point rather than a strong point: it would have been much better to focus on few famous planes, with full cockpit, rather than dispersing the focus on one off prototypes.Thirdly, the challenges: on paper the idea sounds great; each plane in game has a challenge that you need to complete to use the plane in quick action, skirmish and multiplayer mode, furthermore planes are divided in families and you need to unlock the planes one by one in each family. For example completing the F-16A challenge is required to unlock the F-16C challenge, this is again a good idea that could give a good sense of progression as the player slowly gets better and better planes.The execution though is sub-par as challenges are repetitive and more often than not they are unrewarding: one of them requires you to gather at least 20 floating stars while two F-16 will happily sit on your tail firing everything they have, the reward for that is a Jaguar A, unless you are a real Jaguar fan this is not worth the hassle.Not every plane has its challenge so, unless you mess around with the game files or buy them with in-game points gathered after every challenge, you can forget getting the F-22 or Su-47.Lastly there is the rather important fact that this game is supposedly complete, while from my understanding Time Symmetry is largely a one man development team and there are updates coming our way including more planes and challenges (and eventually cockpits). Currently the game is in a broken state and itâs not worth the money.			"

								This game is fantastic, it's simply a spiritual sequel of the classic Ace Combat games that I loved to play on PS2, this game reminds me of the good times and the many hours I spent playing Ace Combat : Distant Thunder, Ace Combat : Squadron Leader and Ace Combat : The Belkan War on my PS2 a few years ago. I highly recommend Vector Thrust to all the fans of this cult saga. Congratulations to TimeSymmetry, the talented developer of this great indie game !			"

Early Access Review
								This game has a great potential, but to be honest here, I have no idea what the developer (has done) or (is doing). Before you get fascinated by the game visuals, trailer or all those positive reviews, you might want to re-think your decision of buying this game because you are gonna end up in a loop of expectations and gonna get disappointed after a couple of months like I did. 1. The game is no Alpha nor Beta stage, its content is missing out so many elements and infact a lot of its parts are rather frustrating to play (AIM-120 missiles that lock but won't follow targets etc/ invincible air units). 2. Meaningless aircraft family missions. Yeah, I understand that each plane has its own variants, but what's the point of unlocking all of them by doing challenges? If you are not gonna use them in the campaign or multiplayer? 3, Speaking of which, there is no multiplayer so far. Edit: Apparently there is, it just hasn't worked for me for some reason. 4. The developer. No seriously, The developer is working really slow, (just as how the developer released the game in an immature status). So many players post a lot of bugs, and they usually get no responses. And what do we get everyweek? Minor big fixes. 5. The developer again, seriously. So one time I suggested that we cancel the ability of planes of shooting ground targets using AIM-9 (Sidewinder), which makes no sense, I know this is not a simulator, but we are also not dumb and a lot of us are aware of this. Then I got replied by a ""fanboy"" later ""Arcade - simulation, pick one. Interestingly, the same fanboy -explained- to another user who was asking about why his AIM-120 had no smoke trailers, that this is REALISTIC. That's when I gave up on the forums and development, I mean seriously, if you are this narrow minded to listen to your fans, go make your own game and play it with your friends, this is a respected community and platform made for users because, like it or not (this might sound harsh) we are paying.6. The developer again, people who do mods, managed to do better stuff than the original developers themselves.  Remember, re-consider your decision, I am un-installing the game, and I won't support the forums and I certainly DON'T recommend buying this.Edit: I am not impersonating the developer, nor saying he is a bad guy, I'm just saying that why start something big when you can't keep up? Again, this is my personal opinion.			"

												This game had so much potential, Its basically a modern ace combat... or would have been if the developer hadnt dropped creating new content and balancing out the system. You have to play through challenges to unlock aircraft, and the story mode only has 10 planes tops; while there are thousands in the challenge mode that cannot be used elsewhere. If development continues this could be a good game one day; but as I previously stated, dev has dropped further work and the buggy half finished mess this turned out as is only worth about 5 bucks.

								Vector Thrust is a good solid game, especially for early access. The gameplay is a bit similar to Jane's Advanced Strike Fighters or Heroes in the Sky. You fly, kill X objects and complete the mission.But, Vector Thrust has several cool elements not found in similar games. It has (upcomming Co-Op and vs multiplayer, a mission editor (Already working) and a cool selection of modern fighter planes.The controls can be set entirely to your liking and so far I didn't encounter any real bugs or errors. Maybe some menu presentation problems, but nothing that actually takes the fun out of the game.A must have for any would be jet jockey.			"

								EARLY ACCESS REVIEW[16MAY2015] Wow.  exactly what I have been hoping for; a spiritual successor to Ace Combat on PC.  My gripes with it are minor:- Ground textures are the sore spot- A small bug with achievements- A few non repeated glitches with menus- Can't remove a keybinding.  change, yes.  Set to nothing, no.  Not really a problem, though- The first campaign mission is poorly presented. [subjective]- I dont like some of the sound effects.- Missing a couple sound effect- no voice [maybe a good thing.  some AC voices were terrible]Nothing gamebreaking.  On to the good parts......+ The controls.  + The controls.+ Seems well optimized+ Dedication to aircraft families.+ So many modes.  + The challenge mode to unlock aircraft.+ No psychological warfare to get me to buy stuff!!!!!!!!!+ The Controls.Progression through the challenge mode by exploring the aircraft family evolution is genius.  So much fun.			"

												I'd honestly like to recommend this game, but the current state makes it hard to accept its status as full retail and the overall price. While it has its redeemable elements, the issues outweigh the cost for the game at the current moment. Unless there's something like a considerable discount  (50% and above) the price isn't right.First off, if you're here wanting an Ace Combat experience, the game is not what you're looking for. Boot up Ace Combat Infinity or hook up an emulator and dust off your PS2 disks instead. Vector Thrust has a lot of promise but at the moment there are many issues that need to be addressed before it happens.OverviewVector Thrust is an indie air combat simulator game with a cel-shaded art direction developed by the TimeSymmetry team, published under Iceberg Interactive. The game features arcade shooter elements such as large amounts of ammunition and fictional aircraft as well as setting, quick-action and skirmish modes, several challenge stages, standalone battle scenarios and a story-driven campaign. There are dozens of aircraft families to chose from, with several variants for each, with aircraft both famous and less-widely-known. The game features original musical score by JosÃ© Pavli.Pros:â Interesting proposal of a constructed world and timeline, in similar fashion to the known Ace Combat series.â Active modding community with many additional aircraft, paint schemes, NPC voices, weapon, scenery, and extra contentâ Good graphical detail on aircraft exteriors as well as weapons.â Cel-shaded artstyle that gives a colorful, unique appearance to the game.*Cons:â Underwhelming amount of content for a full release, with many placeholder and seemingly rushed material, as well as incomplete or missing individual aircraft, challenge and aircraft family descriptions.â Disorganized content that yields misreferenced audio and dialogue, mismatching speech and text along occasional typos.â Slow campaign story pacing, with little emotional response to character interaction.*â Scenery seems simple and uninteresting at best, and downright barren at worst.â Removal-- and subsequent lack of restoration of HUD customization from older versions.â Steep AI difficulty curve from unresponsive to highly challenging during gameplay.â Friendly AI ground units during campaign seem to be mainly unresponsive to enemy presence.â Occasional crashes during gameplay.â Sound effects are toned down from how they actually sound in reality, along a distinct lack of sound in some occasions (sounds after a certain distance are inaudible, secondary aircraft explosions lack sound, etc).â Anti-air artillery and guns are exceedingly lethal (ranging from straight bullet death rays with zero spread to one-shell-kills) for a game that tries leaning to an arcade style, and missile guidance seems to be overly inaccurate.*â Voice acting can be described as ""campy"" in some lines, while it seems to be toned down in others.**: In my personal view and/or opinion.Other NotesNow, I will admit that I didn't buy this game expecting a perfect Ace Combat Infinity replacer on the PC, with all its features and complete, polished game mechanics, but Vector Thrust fails to accomplish a few things that I needed to have the patience to personally dig up info around (missing descriptions for aircraft like the XF10F, find proper replacement sounds for explosions and gunfire, add and reposition special weapons on aircraft that lacked secondary weapons while there were obvious hardpoints to support those, etc.) which wouldn't be needed to be done otherwise, which eventually got wiped as files were revalidated and updated into newer files, which, while I had hoped would have even more accurate info than what I had found out and filled in, sadly were the previous state of the files before I made any changes.I'll give the TS team credit, the game has come a long way from the start as far as I see, but despite the slow update frequency I would rather have it that way than leave early access in the current state-- which just feels forced. Many things like aforementioned typos and dialogue lines being cut short or misreferenced, or even missing, it all makes me feel like the game still needed more development and content before being branded as full retail version.This doesn't mean I gave up on the game, and all things considered, it is a decent game on itself with good potential, but for its current price Vector Thrust is not a reasonable deal at all, which is the main issue and a huge turn-off for anyone interested. I'm hoping that the devs don't take this review wrong as being only me lashing out disappointment, because in fact, those are just issues I'd rather see addressed sooner than later, since I hope to see this game attain a proper status as spiritual successor to Ace Combat. Right now however, it's not.			"

												As many of you who are reading this review must be doing, I read the top negative reviews before buying the game. And to be honest, right now, this game is abselutely not worth it. In fact, it is the very first game that I requested a refund. Here's a few reasons why, as well as some good points. Yes I did only play about 20 minutes, but yes, that was more than enough.Cons:-THE biggest issue: took me 3 hours to get this to actually work. The only fix that worked? Switching back to the last build (as proposed by the devs, using a beta option they created). Problem with this is that even this fix needs manual fixing.-No tutorial. Want to know the controls? Go read.-No access to options in-game, need to go back to main screen. Launched the campaign expecting the first mission to teach you how to play? Nope! And no, game doesn't even allow you to know in-game what controls to use.-Unintuitive keyboard controls. I though GTA had bad flight controls. Mouse for view, arrows for up-down pitch and roll left or right, WASD for thrust, brake, left-right turn. Don't have 3 hands? Too bad. This could have been improved by using the numpad instead of arrows. Also, chaff, flares, etc are bound by default to 6-7-8, while cameras are 1-2-3. I think that defenses are more important than a good angle of vision, but maybe that's just me.-Boring fights. I tried to play the first mission, and it pretty much resumes to: fly to target, fly to enemy, keep on rolling with enemy and wait for missile lock. Launch. Repeat. All you do is do loops again and again. That is not realistic, because any real pilot doing that would loose consciousness. -Equipment information seems wrong: the first rockets you get are described as ""unguided"", yet they still lock and follow targets...Pros:-Combat system is good, but the poor controls and poor AI just doing loops pretty much negates this.-Lots of play modes, including (but not limited to) campaign, multiplayer, skirmishes.-Graphics. Although even on max graphics the planes still look a little low-res (see the game screenshots above for examples), one thing that actually amazed me is that they added the visual effect of passing the speed of sound. That I haven't seen often.-Sounds. I tried the two planes that are available initially, and both had they own engine sounds, weapon sounds, etc. So, as you can see, and as many others have said, the bases are there and good, but the finishing touch was scrapped.

Early Access Review
								Flight simulators are something I haven't been able to get into for many years, not since the earlier days of console flight combat when there were fun and less complicated arcade action experiences that focused more on intense combat than technical realism. Vector Thrust is the only of its kind in a long while to grab my attention and keep me plowing through the campaign obsessively the same way I did all those years ago, marathoning rental copies of Ace Combat for hours through late summer nights off from school.In production for over two long years of dedicated development, Vector Thrust has already found a loyal fanbase of people such as myself who have been yearning for a lost aerial combat experience that is easy enough to hop into for all skill levels while still challenging enough to encourage thorough practice and countless heated retries in arcade spirit. Vector Thrust is a one of a kind aerial combat title that excels where the bigger companies have failed recently in delivering open dogfighting action that manages to keep me wanting to play through objectives over and over due to being just plain entertaining without the filler of modern games.The game presents anâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥kicking soundtrack as well as a slick cell-shaded style that while not exactly realistic gives a polished and stylish appearance to the explosive imagery of combat. Though it may not be a popular choice, it stands out and gave me a certain nostalgia for the cell-shaded visuals in Robotech: Battlecry and similar arcade-y air combat titles of the PS2 era.The two campaign are a work in progress but already feature sixteen action packed missions between them that showcase everything from intercepting bombers to bombing carriers out in the ocean. These cover the core types of objectives you'll be carrying out as the game is fleshed out during its Early Access period and the campaign is crafted into a complete story with a narrative.The variety and accessibility of the missions keeps the modest length campaign engaging from beginning to end, ground assaults feel a little rough with not a lot of risk of being shot down as you descend to bomb them but air-to-air dogfights are exhilarating and incredibly well done. Air-to-air combat is intense and fast paced and the A.I. is cunning and deceptive in how it maneuvers out of your view and attempts to keep you in sight at all times.Before embarking on any given mission you're given a selection of true to life aircraft and their respective weapons to consider when taking on specific tasks. The selection is already great ranging from heavy and slow A-10 bombers to quick and deadly F-15 fighters and each excel in their own unique way, requiring you to put some thought into what you bring with you into combat. The environments you take flight in are gorgeous setting that paint the perfect backdrop for an all-out war, ranging from the dusty sand dunes of deserts to the sunny islands of the tropics.The challenge mode appears to be the real bread and butter of the game being where most of the hundreds of aircraft are unlocked in the expansive tree of increasingly powerful choices. Each plane unlocked is a new mission earned, leading to even more unlocks for a massive amount of content that is genuinely exciting to blast through. The challenges are quick craft-specific tests of reflex and skill that present you with a seemingly simple task but must be conquered in expert speed.These challenges are generally straight forward enough to finish, but the real difficulty comes in learning how complete each one in quick enough time to earn yourself a decent enough grade to move on and earn your next fighter and its respective mission. Each of the challenges include both a local and online score board enticing the player to revisit each of the diabolical scenarios to test your ability and see how you fare against the rest of the world.Vector Thrust has come a long way since its already electrifying early alpha and is already the perfect arcade combat sim for people who just want to jump into some action and shoot their opposition out of the sky. With the promise of a fleshed out narrative that dramatically pulls you into the action in classic Ace Combat fashion, a more fleshed out multiplayer experience, and heaps more content to an already huge roster of available airplanes and modes this is the number one air combat fix to keep an eye on right now.Whether you're a thrill-seeking arcade action fan looking for that quick dogfight or a hardcore sim veteran with a love for realism looking for something different Vector Thrust is absolutely the most accessible fun you'll have in a game in the genre which says a lot given the indie status, small budget, and even smaller team and it can only get better on its way out of Early Access.

												This is a game of frustration.Don't buy it.Number of planes doesn't make up for clumsy controls (for those who don't have flight-oriented joysticks -honestly, if you've bought this game - first thing - redefine control keys to avoid situations, where you need at the same time press W (or S), ctrl, space and 8, while controlling your aircraft with arrows), lack of good picture (you plane looks cool... and that's all what you'd be seeing. I understand that there is little else to see in flight sims... but some backgrounds/landscape could be good), clumsy target-switching (it may be my problem, but I'm yet to find a way to do thing like choosing nearest target or nearest to center of screen target - right now I can only switch forward through them, hoping that I'd find the one I want to hit soon). And remember - this game teaches us that in modern air combat you should never use missiles - they never hit (I've launched about 20 missiles at aircrafts flying in a straight line without using any counter-measures - scored 2 hits), except when fired at you (in short term - game developers severely lowered chances for missiles to hit for player-launched missiles, while AI almost never misses without counter-measure launch and/or frantic maneuvers on your side)Update:After almost a year - I've decided to try this game once more, noticing that there were some updates. And there are some positive changes. Yes, now you can hit with about one missile out of 2 that is fired at the enemy aircraft flying in straight line without using counter measures. Well, actually there is a switch between missile modes in game options - ""old"", ""stat-based"", ""arcade"". I dunno difference between two last, but both seem to hit more accurately (thus - 1 out of 2). But all other problems stay. Campaign is a pit of frustraction. Game may have got a little better, but still belongs to a dump.			"

												Let's start with a simple fact: this game is not perfect. It's not even amazing, nor great. It is buggy like hell, tedious with its menu interface, annoying when it crashes and, in all honesty, shallow with content.But where Vector Thrust shines will be enough for people who are just looking for one thing - simple, plain, fast-paced dogfight action. The game is a perfect example of a title that you can play for an hour or so a day, on a break from duties or between other games.And to be honest, it has all the features it needs - the flight experience in Vector Thrust is just fantastic. The plane acts like you imagine it would, has the proper weight and feel to it. Guns and missiles are done really well and splashing a sidewinder into enemy's face is really damn satisfying. There's a nice variety of fighters - even if most of them are reskins, or slightly different meshes, they all pilot differently and can carry a huge array of various load. And if that's not enough, then one of the game's strongest sides is the modding community - there's quite a lot of skins and there are even entire fighters (Morgan! <3) that you can download. So far I had no problems with mods too.All in all, I can't recommend VT to everyone, all the negative reviews here are a proof why. But if you turn a blind eye to the early-accessy feel to the game and give a little trust to the developer, who constantly, though slowly, adds new stuff, then you get a great relax-issuing title, with one thing that it does amazingly well. If you're a fan of fighter combat and don't mind the fact that the campaigns barely work, you might just get a few really good hours with skirmish or multiplayer. Especially if you find it on a Steam sale (recently VT was 40% off, that's a good deal).Also, a tip: learn to use the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ AOA Limiter. The game doesn't point that feature at all, unfortunately, but it's only when you turn it off and let the G-Forces flow through the plane that you feel like a real â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ ace, swinging in aerobatics toe to toe with foes.

								This is somewhat a customised version and mod free flight sims arcade. It's still in Alpha so my opinion based on it, maybe in full released all the ""Cons"" I listed might get fixed and improve.Pros:-Classic manuever and engage like good ol' Ace combat. -No ACAH DFM/ASM just classic style of hunting prey with missile and gun. -Tons of creation or scenario can be made with the editor, You can re-create some of your favourite AC mission-Tons of Aircraft to be played, More aircraft hope to be added in future.-Variety enemy, even a giant fortress and large missile sub, maybe an ""Arkbird alike or SOLG"" in future dev?-Good AI, feel the tense when battling. -Difficulty is somewhat mixed match some easy to finish some toughCons:-The graphic for terrain and surrounding need more improvement-The aircraft viewer look plain need some creativeness-Need aircraft viewer in ALL gamemode since it help on navigate the aircraft/weapons choosing-Still feel some latency on firing the weapons-Graphic need some improvement, I keep getting Frames drop during massive battle-Voice actor, please find more passionate not drunk-music and ambient average, some of the music good but most feel plain-some crash but rare occasion only since this still in Early stageFinal words: Eventhough It still in early stage and there so much thing need to improve. I can see this game has bright future it even give me better experience than AC:AH (the only AC pc). This game mostly sandbox for now, if you hoping for story mission just for wait for the game to full release since I can't recommend it for now. But for those who want to get going test all aircraft available and create your own battle GO AHEAD Worth A While For You.  Best Flight Arcade Sims on par with AC "

												Bought it, tried it for an hour. It crashed three times in that hour, twice on the same mission. I got three missions in, and was bored or angry the whole way through.Pros:It does emulate Ace Combat to some degree, but not in the places that countCons:-Voice acting is bad. Not even like mediocre. I can handle medicore, but this is just bad. I think CASTLE is supposed to be Irish, but the accent is barely there. Everyone sounds either unenthused or forcing their lines. I ended up turning the volume down during their side sequence. It's supposed to be touching and emotional, I think, but it's ruined by the voice acting since the cutscene is just a still.-On the subject of sound design, it's honestly infuriating. This game will not let your ears have a moment of peace. If a missile gets locked to you prepare to hear the most piercing, annoying beep every .5 seconds until you break the lock. IF you break the lock. Game is very missle spammy, which isn't too big a problem, but with that missile lock sound it's horrible.-As well, music is very off. I'm getting this slow, rhythmic, 'heroic'-esque music in the middle of a dogfight.-Flying is slow and dull. It's almost like their design was split between arcade and flight sim, and it ends up being neither. Pick one.-Dogfighting isn't fun. This is partially due to to how the flying feels, but mostly how locking on works and how terrible missles are. Locking on takes forever, it takes a full two-three seconds when behind a target and flying straight for the lock on to align. It's the same for ground targets. Locking on is a joke. I point my nose at something I clearly want to bomb, and I lock onto something halfway across the map.I'm being harsh because I just got my third crash, which by the way happened in one of the still cutscenes, which causes you to have to replay the mission you just completed because for some reason the game hadn't registered I had passed it already. I've requested a refund.I want this game to be good, I want it to be great. I grew up on Ace Combat and other flying games. I can understand it doesn't have to be a perfect clone, nor might the designers want it to be. But it has to be fun, and this isn't. Hopefully i will be able to change my review one day.			"

												EDIT: THIS IS NOT A PRE-RELEASE REVIEW. Check the date of this review before harassing me.This game shouldn't have left early access, it feels like it was never finished, and it feels like it never will be.At least, not anytime soon.I really wanted to be able to get into this game, but it never happened for various reasons.When I bought this game, I wasn't expecting a serious flight simulator, I was expecting a game that was going to be similar to Ace Combat's arcade-y feel.However, I never got that feel. In fact, a lot of the planes feel very awkward and strange, and the story feels completely uninspired, and the music is alright, but it's nothing to write about. I knew the flying mechanics would be different, but the mechanics in this game need a lot more work before they feel like they have enough depth to be a good thing. I personally think there should be more feedback with every action, not just visually, but in the audio, the HUD, in anything. The immersion in the game is also extremely weak, which I personally believe is made worse when players hear the awkward voice acting.One of the strongest positives about this game ( and perhaps the only one ) is the ability to mod the game and to create your own content.However, the game is very small, and the modding community is even smaller. That means we will never be able to have intensive modding scenes that other games have, because this game died before it even had life. There are a few mods out there already, but they are nowhere as amazing as they could have been.This game was developed by like one guy, however, the video game industry is a competitive market. There isn't a moment where we can say 'You get an A for effort.' because in the end, the consumers still need to spend money for the product. I'm hoping that this game somehow gets revived in the future, but it's very unlikely, and I cannot recommend this game unless players are absolutely sure that this is a game that they want to invest in the game as it is.

								If you enjoy the Ace Combat franchise then you will enjoy Vector Thrust. It can run on almost any computer that has Windows XP (Which is what I use) or later and still looks fantastic. The game is a little buggy at points but since its still in Alpha its understandable and these issues will most likely be worked out in future updates. The game is also very easy to modify (At least in Alpha) where you can add your own music, missions, skins, aircraft and much more. And with an active fansite and monthly updates this game will be played for years to come.			"

								As of v0.9102:Vector Thrust is an action arcade combat flight sim.  It has nice cel shaded jets, and not so nice ground textures.Quite competent AI with two levels of difficulty (grunt and ace) and 25 degrees of competence per difficulty (1 being the easiest to handle and 25 being the hardest). So, almost anyone can find an opponent that's fun to dogfight with.Controls are pretty solid and work just fine with keyboard, gamepad or joystick/hotas. Although, gamepad and joystick do require some rebinding.Campaign is pretty good, since most of the time you're gonna be doing the fun part - dogfighting. When it's time for ""destroy ground targets"" missions, you might get a bit bored.Additional customisation with purchasable jets and weapons adds some variety to the game and it seems that developers plan to add a lot more stuff there.So, to wrap it up - very solid, pretty fun action arcade combat flight sim. (unless you do ground missions)More details in the video:

Early Access Review
								Understanding that this game is still a very early release, it's got a long way to go, but it's already come very far.Yes, there's some problems, but they're being ironed out as new content is going to be added, but whether or not the content in game is ripe enough to be adequately played at the moment is a question that comes down to a personal matter:If you're here for the ground attack part of arcade flight games, things aren't too great for you right now. Not a lot targets to shoot at, objects to fly between, ground attack munitions are now more or less properly implemented, but there's little obligation to be low, and typical of Ace Combat, little drive to fly an attacker rather than a fighter.However, if you're here for dogfighting action, most planes work roughly as they're intended, even those that aren't fully ready yet. Between the multiplayer mode, skirmish, and the mission editor, an intelligent player who came for the dogfighting will get their fill.In the mean time, it's one of the best arcade flight experiences I've had in a long time, coupled with one of the more user-friendly editors (I'm looking at you, ArmA ), so even if it's nowhere near done right now, it's still quite a lot of game to sink your teeth into.Oh. Not having fun? Set up a Skirmish with the mutators Itano Circus and Overdrive enabled. I dare you to not have fun then.Editted for relevance: as of this writing, ground attack munitions now work.

												Ive been a long time fan of the Ace Combat franchise and in addition to to Ace Combats 4, 5, Zero, and 6, I have also played other flight arcade/simulator games such as Over G Fighters, Lock On Modern Air Combat, and the IL2 series. It was my fond memories of the Ace Combat franchise that lead me to this game.I want to start off by mentioning this, while the game is marketed as a spiritual successor ( I would say that its more along the lines of paying homage to the series specifically AC4, AC5, and AC Zero), its not exactly like the franchise. So if you are looking for a PC version of the Strangereal Ace Combats and expecting this to have alot of the game mechanics and poignant storyline of the AC franchise then you will be sorely disappointed.With that being stated, there are a few things to keep in mind regarding this game. For starters from my understanding of the news I have been hearing, the person who created this game is ether working with a small staff or by himself so the updates for the game maybe slugglish when compared to other games in a similar genre. Nevertheless some of the content is well worth the wait. Secondly, one of the primary traits of this game is the ability to modify it as well as build missions. So if there is a certain factor you dont like, chances are you can change it. If you want a more Ace Combat feel then you can make it that way. The modding community is small but can provide you with most anything you are probably looking for.So onto the gameplay, the gameplay is kinda what you would expect for an arcade flight game, planes carrying 100+ missiles, non realistic maneuvers etc. Nevertheless there are some things that you will find moreso in flight sims rather than Ace Combat such as the ability to despense chaff and flares.Graphics wise, the majority of the detail went into the planes that you fly so the planes look pretty good for the style of illustration the creator used. Currently of the large selections of planes you can fly, only the F-16 has an actual cockpit but its not functioning, yet. Nevertheless like I mentioned before, the game is still recieving updates though.Story wise, you can tell that the game's universe was heavily influenced by the Strangereal universe in the Ace Combat series. The cutscenes in the current campaign thats availible took queues from specifically Ace Combat 4 by using stills rather than video. This is where in my opinion was the biggest let down simply because the cutscenes only have one still that would give you a picture of the beginning of the scene but you hear an entire scene unfolding.Overall would I recommend? Yes because in spite of all of the negative things I have just mentioned, this game has alot of potential. Between the mods, the mission builder and the future updates, the game can potentially become a decent, enjoyable game. Sadly the game will never be able to break out of the shadow of Ace Combat because Ace Combat is really the only game to really compare and or relate to this game (in spite of not liking that comparison, I was a hypocrite and compared it to the Ace Combat series constantly). Overall I would recommend waiting a while for the games bugs to be worked out and more content to be added. Also as much as I love the game, paying $25 dollars for a game that is still progressing slowly may be a bit too much. However I justified it as a donation to a guy who is most likely working with a small crew or no crew at all to keep working on this game.			"

												AFTER RELEASE:Now I wasn't the only one to say they weren't very happy when Vector Thrust came out of beta, the campaign was rather disapointing and the lack of certain aircraft families was annoying.That being said since release Time Symmetry has implemented some new aircraft (including the MiG-31), made a missle model changer (Arcadey, Old, and Realistic), fixed some issues related to the game, and there are plans to add more features in the future.With the future in mind, Vector Thrust is shaping up to be a great Air Combat game that I see myself coming back to for years to come.Finally I'd like to reitterate that this game is highly modable and the developer encourages it, that alone should be a reason to check out this solid game.There is nothing quite like this currently on STEAM, so if you are looking for a good Semi-Arcade Air Combat game why not give Vector Thrust a try?EARLY ACCESS:If you enjoyed the gameplay of any of the PS1/PS2 Ace Combat games or any of the AirForce Delta series and are looking for a experience comparable to such, this is the game for you.In Ace Combat 5 Namco reached just over 50 aircraft for the player to fly, as a comparision, Vector Thrust has already surpassed that and Time Symmetry has planned to include somewhere near 200 official aircraft in Vector Thrust's final stages!Also with the in-game Editor which allows for an nearly endless amount of mission possibilities, and including moddability the replayability of Vector Thrust is through the roof.In the Early Access stages Vector Thrust has already proven to me to be easily worth the $15 ($13.49 if purchased before Aug 28th 2014) and I plan to spend hundreds of hours on this game.

								Its good alright, however there are still some work to be done, a lot of work, cockpit view is unfinished (at least on my one)the explosions and sound effects still needs work, flying is good, very ace combat like, needs cool music.If you are a big ace combat fan, this is for you, it may be unfinished, but it will be interesting and exciting to see how this will turn out after future updates,I hope they add in a workshop in the future.anyways, great game.

Early Access Review
								//// TL;DR Version ////think of VT like Fallout: New Vegas, except with less original content that came with the initial purchase (you can get more content free at moddb.com, supported by the dev himself). This is due to the number of bugs needed to be fixed since the game revolves around creator content.You can buy now and enjoy what the community has to offer (and still growing). Might not look like much but alike New Vegas, you'd get more content than anything Bandai Namco has to or will offer  you with 112.33% cheaper price tag.-------------------------------------------------------------/// Pre-release Review ///With the way Ace Combat is going, this is one of the gems of arcade flight sim that sums up the entirety of AC and more with originality that's kept me months from playing Ace Combat: Infinity.It's still an Early Access, but even at that the AI aces pulls me to point-blank range without pulling off maneuvers where you'd need an omni-directional thrusters to pull off. All of that without the missiles being suckish.Guaranteed will be better than AC. â/infinity//// After Release (Per July 5 2015) ////After playing halfway through the Hollow Thunder campaign (fully-voiced, full-fledged original campaign), I don't have much crashes as others have claimed. I find this great, considering it's original EA release was full of bugs you can't seem to play it after 5 minutes.There are only 2 crashes during my 5 hour gameplay; the last one being me modding some stuff and testing it out; I find this release actually better than any arcade flight games on Steam right now. Vector Thrust gives you total freedom over the game, play it however you want.Although, keep in mind that VT was built with modding around its centre, thus some people who just wanted constant stream of contents without making one might not be entertained as much. VT has the core gameplay of Ace Combat, yet gives you the ""Debug"" side of it; making you see and control the developer side of the game. If you think you can feel fine with modding (even as simple as making skins), you'd be having a great time with VT's easy-to-learn modding system.The majority of negative reviews I've seen are mostly people who can't make contents and whine instead of helping those who does make them. You can check Moddb.com for the majority of free addons that expand the game two-fold; maybe helping them out too by giving feedbacks. You'd be surprised that some of the bugs you have (if you still have) can be easily fixed by contacting the community.			"

Early Access Review
								It's a pretty good flight arcade game even at this stage.The aircrafts selection are great, you're not limited by just a handful of selected aircrafts but it's entire family branch including fictional and real-world variants. Although it can be only unlocked to be used in other gamemodes(excluding Campaign) after you've acquire/complete the challenge for the specific aircraft.The challenges are a bit incomplete but still the aircrafts are there, this is where the modability comes in. Aircrafts can also be unlocked through modifying the game data but this isnt the point, this game is open for modding so you can install a modded aircraft into the game, or even that insane 76mm aircraft gun armament. There's even sound and music mod that give yourself that old nostalgic feel from that one game everyone who owns this game know of(hint hint, wink wink).Although I've seen a lot of demand for multiplayer duels, but I honestly looking for a Co-op campaign similar to Ace Combat Joint assault where it cant be all 4 player in one map or split into two groups of twos in separate map/area and each area will effect the other.Overall this is a great game to own, if you hate/dislike incomplete game this early access might not be your cup of tea, if you like modding stuff or just looking back for that old nostalgic feel then this is the game for you!-note, hint hint. wink wink: okay it's Ace Combat, happy?

								Dispite its bugs in early access,  Vector Thrust Is an outstanding Acrade Flight shooter. (Note the use of ""arcade."" this is not a sim)  All the mechanics are in there, and with the inclusion of modding capablity, map and mission editors, and already stellar AI, I can only see this game getting even better as time passes. I would have paid MORE than $15 if I could have.This is the true spiritual successor to Ace Combat. Take to the skies with the aces of Strangereal once again!""Yo, buddy.

								Every bit as dumb and avionic illiterate as its forebears, but at the same time utterly brilliant.  The AI is brutal and highly aggressive and as a long time fan of Ace Combat, as well as other more hardcore sims, I can't help but me impressed by the sheer kinetic nature of the dogfights.  There are a plethora of planes for military aviation nerds to ogle over, including some highly imaginative fictional and prototype variants for just about every plane family depicted.  Don't just wait for it to leave Early Access, get in this nonsense now and appreciate the glory of chasing some poor F-104 Starfighter down in a F-22 while slowly peppering it with cannon fire.			"

												While I really hate to give them game a negative reviewIt's been much too long, even for day one bugs.First off, this game is awesome, while I think it had some things in gameplay I don't like...The dogfighting is fun, although the planes handling could be polished to be more responsive if you ask me.The one thing, the one thing that â¥â¥â¥â¥s this game up the most isA.

												This game is an early access title that was rushed out the door. It fails horribly at being a spiritual successor to ace combat or being a clone. The controls are sluggish and they sometimes dont work at all. The game has so many bugs and it crashes a lot. The performance is horrible. Updates are very slow. Even for being on sale for $6.24 its not worth getting.If you want a game that is even remotely fun get Ace Combat Assault Horizon on sale. Better yet find a PS2 and see if you have a store near you that sells old games.I got Air Combat, Ace Combat 4, Ace Combat 5, and Ace Combat Zero at Vintage Stock.			"

												Tries to emulate Ace Combat (Not Horizon, other Ace Combats), but fails in many aspects.The flying is very stale and stable (you don't -feel- like you're in an actual Jet) and it sacrifices a lot of what made Ace Combat good in favor of, I guess, realism? Missiles are hardly responsive, voice acting is mediocre (not really bad a thing, but...) and the developers are full of themselves for releasing this as a FULL PRODUCT when the patch notes clearly state it's never even reached version 1.0 yet. This is still a frickin' beta.			"

Early Access Review
								At first glance this game looks like an Ace Combat clone. Well, in some aspects yes, however it's not entirely that. Vector Thrust borrows elements of the classic arcade style flight simulator, however keeps all the difficulty of realistic air combat. You have various different subsystems that you can enable or disable in your aircraft using the keyboard and while controlling all of your primary weapon and engine systems with your joypad or flight stick. Enemies aren't dumb as rocks waiting to get killed by incoming missiles and will use flares just like you to evade incoming projectiles, and they will organize themselves and cover each other as proper wingmen should, covering their allies as you engage them and even doing their best to distract you from your main objective. Its a bit refreshing to fight against a properly and equally matched AI.When playing this game, I was shot down on my second mission playing on normal difficulty. On any other game I probably would have thrown my arms up in rage and said ""screw this, this is stupid!"" but instead I smiled and nodded, accepting my defeat and coming to realize that this game doesn't treat you like the hotshot ace you think you are in Ace Combat. Aside from the game being in beta and using starter aircraft, the game didn't hold back, which in reality is ""normal"" behavior in a combat situation. I went off ahead of the squad and lost all my wingmen because I didn't properly cover them or cooperate with them, and as a result toward the end I was out performed and outnumbered ultimately leading to my failure, which is NORMAL in a combat situation, especially if you're in an aircraft unfit for long term dogfights like the starter aircraft. Normally when I want to truly enjoy an arcade sim like Ace Combat I crank up the difficulty to hard, which is rare for me to do in many other games because they often fall back on cheap gimmics like enemies that simply have more health than you and pinpoint accuracy, or enemies that are too aggressive and bullrush players into submission. Ace Combat would subvert this, but when I wanted to feel the thrill of having an equaly matched opponent and actually earn that ""ace"" status I'd turn it up to 11. Ace Combat however, excluding Assault Horizone, was a very story driven franchise, (which I loved before it turned into ""Call of Duty: Jets""), So it did very little to get in the way of progression, giving you just the right amount of challenge without making it too difficult to where you'd be stuck and frustrated with the game. Vector Thrust however treats each mission like an everyday sortie, and going it alone will only get you killed like the hotshot you are. This game has the potential to be something great and I hope they continue with what their doing. Realistic combat in an Arcade style simulator isn't all that bad. ""Operation Flashpoint: Red River"" is a decent example of that fusion of Call of Duty mixed with Arma style gameplay. I definitely recommend this to anyone into old school flight sims, but also what the ""pickup and play"" style of arcade flight sims.			"

Early Access Review
								At time of writing this game is in EARLY ACCESS.The campaign missions are there, but there is no story yet. The challenge mode is not yet finished with many challenges needing to be fixed / implemented properly. There's a minor bug where the lead indicator disappears occasionally, and the targeting system badly needs a revamp.HOWEVER.This game has earned my full support at this time. I am rather strict about my standards for flight games. Everything, every single one gets put up against Freespace 2, because that was my first. If you look through my reviews, I blasted Strike Suit Zero, because it is utter garbage. This game is for lack of a better descriptor an ""Ace Combat clone"". That's a damn good thing. The only AC to come to PC has been that godawful Assault Horizon. This game is similar to Ace combat in basic arcade format gameplay, and it has all the basic features like radar, lots of missiles, etc. We've not had something like that to go to on PC, and now we do. It's not as hardcore as FS2 or Arma or Flaming Cliffs, but it's a good game for what it is.The core gameplay is very solid. The cannon is actually useful, missiles behave like missiles and require proper use instead of spam, AOA limit release makes for more interesting dogfights. The primary mode people play right now is Skirmish mode, which has these incredible mutators. It's got 00 Gundam's Trans-am in ""overdrive"", it's got basic mutators like guns only, it's got an Itano Circus mutator, it's even got an ""Eggplane"" mode that SDs all the planes. It's like big head mode for a flight game, and big head mode has always cracked me up.The game also advertises mod support. People have already produced new aircraft, and skins for existing aircraft, of course including idolm@s skins because I don't know how that caught on but I guess it's tradition now.This game is still early access, and it's rather bare bones at the moment, but it's a damn good showing so far and if it's complete state lives up to the dev's promises, it'll be a great game, better than Ace Combat's recent showings for sure.

Early Access Review
								This is the game you're looking for if you have that jet fighter itch and don't have a PS2 to play Ace Combat 4. The controls feel nice and fleshed out for each plane to give each a pretty distinct feel. Some similarities are bound to occur since it has an arcadey feel, but overall you can feel what each jet can do the best with about 3 minutes of flying them. There's also some more complex controls that I haven't really used/figured out yet but they're all pretty simplified to access(using a 360 controller to play). There are multiple game modes of which i've only played 2 so far. Quick missions is essentially a randomized assortment of DM/TDM matches as well as solo dog fights. Haven't had any ground attack missions so far since I like to fly fighters, but they might be in there. Campaign has a very similar start as AC4 did, although the story isn't exatly great so far compared to AC4. All I've gathered is that I'm a mercenary airman fighting in a war and that I need to win, who needs much more than that? Only small complaint I have on the campaign is that the mission objectives aren't exactly specified on your mini map/radar. You'll get a something like a ""TGT"" when it gets in sight, but nothing on the map really. A different color on the mini map could help, but I enjoy flying the jets enough to where i really don't mind.Even though i haven't played it for a long time, it has that feel of a game that is on the verge of reaching the top and I'd highly reccommend it to anybody wanting a good jet fighter game even if it's still early access. I'll probably give an update as I get further into the campaign and game itself on the feel of the all the different jets and overall mission quality. As of now, I'd give it a nice 8.5/10 for a fresh game. Opinion may change as I get further.			"

For example, I was not happy with the stealth parameter of F-22 and speed parameter of F-15 and I made them more realistic. "

												I felt it was necessary for me to post  my review because I've read many of the reviews already posted and I can't disagree more with some of them. And these kinds of reviews probably scare away future buyers, and I think that it's not fairly justified.I like Vector Thrust. I was an avid Ace Combat fan, I remember losing dozens of hours of my life on Ace Combat on the PSP (which VT is almost identical to). I've heard people complain about the controls being clunky on a Keyboard, but in all honesty, what in the world were you expecting? It's a keyboard! And the current control scheme is identical to the key mapping in Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, which was released on PC. Besides, if it irritates anyone that much, it is possible to remap your keys.The mod community is active and you'll be able to get all sorts of custom skins and aircraft. If the Steam workshop doesn't have the variety you're looking for, there's significantly more on moddb.com.With that out of the way, here are some things I have a problem with:-I don't know why this game is listed as a released game. It belongs in Early Access.-Why is the price so damn high?? I've followed this game since it was on Desura, and I picked it up in a bundle for four dollars. That's for this game in adition to several other games. This game should not cost 25 bucks.-Up until recently, the multiplayer was completely broken. Content updates are few and far between.-The story will probably make you yawn. Mostly because of the voice acting.In conclusion: I highly recommend people to get this game, especially if you like the older Ace Combat games. Don't let the negative reviews convince you that this game isn't worth playing. However, do not pay 25 dollars for this game. Get it on a sale or in a bundle. "

												This game has so much untapped potential.It is currently incomplete, although you can play through the entire campaign and see the ending credits.The game only ever crashed on me once!- it is hard to adjust the sound so you can hear the dialog over engine noise etc. There are several sliders, but they are only available from the main menu :(- The challenge mode boasts tons of unique airplanes with interesting history, but only 95% of the aircraft can be unlocked and many of the 'fun' experimental fighters have really horrible stats when you do play with them.- The Mirage in the campaign had no special weapons and when I play with it the XP is given to another plane.- The story is cool enough, but the missions suddenly become very unbalanced when you use realistic missile stats on easy. (I had to cheat to get through 2 of them).- Mission 1 has two parts, it teleports you halfway but I did not notice, so every time it said ""stay with target"" I changed course - apparently that ends the mission (it could do with checkpoints!)- The third camera mode is awesome to look at but impossible to play in. Game could use a replay feature post-mission so you can use awesome camera mode.- All models are extremely detailed despite the low-res textures on ANGELS etc. Too bad you only ever see it in the editor. Consider making scripted events mid-mission so you get to see close-up footage of the gun-emplacements and tanks at least once in-game.- Audio Dialog should be normalized - there was one issue of a squad member being VERY loud while the others were almost silent (Good thing it has subtitles!).- The game lacks dooms-day weaponry. It would be awesome to have at least one aircraft with a laser or swarmer-missiles or scorched-earth-cluster-bomb-of-doom or something.- Last level is ideal for some underground flight, so open up those hangar doors and put a generator inside.- Sometimes scripted events cut off dialogs early. Like in mission 11 where I still don't know what Lynx wanted to tell me about the ANGELS.- There are a lot of abbreviations that never gets explained. Consider adding dialog to explain what CAS, AWACS, RCS etc. is before every NPC starts flingin pilot jargon everywhere.- The game could do with explanations for special options. E.g. I had no idea what the AOA limiter was until I disabled it and performed a turn so sharp, my aircraft suffered structural damage :D The AOA limiter and the engines_off button could perhaps become usefull if it was not so harmfull. Oh, and I was wondering if disabling the AOA limiter can lead to black-out and red-out. It should.- The title of the game is vector thrust, but there is no button to enable vector thrust. I suppose it is another 'thing to come' item, but I am disappointed that even VTOL planes do not have any special mode of operation. ... There IS a button for Special Operations ""O"", but it does not do anything as far as I can tell.- This game could end up beating both Ace Combat and HAWX, and it is so close - it is just incomplete. I can't wait to see the finished product.- I read the list of ""mutations"" in the editor. Now we just need maps that use them, and we'll have even more fun!			"

								v0.9118 Review.  This is Air/Ace Combat with more meat and potatoes.  It's a compelling game because of the unique blend of arcade and simulation flight aspects.  In a way, it serves as a bridge between the two: 1. Weapons are realistically modeled and behave with some realism  for the most part.2. Planes fly with a largely arcade style, except for stalling.  You can deep stall your plane in a ""cobra maneuver"" for fabulous or disastrous results.  It seems very well suited to eventual multiplayer.  3. Air to air combat is engaging.  The AI is ok, but nothing great.  Angles/distance matter, speed and altitude don't.4. Air to ground combat leaves a lot to be desired.  Most of the weapons you will be able to afford are not up to the task, and since nearly every object can be targeted, you will end up making extra, frustrating, passes over areas in an attempt to select the right one.  5. The cell shaded art style is very well done, with planes having realistic moving flight surfaces.I like the game, there is a lot of potential here.  If you liked Air/Ace Combat, it is a definite recommend, just be advised that the production values in the Ace Combat games are not yet present.			"

								If you are familiar with Ace Combat, you'll feel right at home.  Will take you just a little bit of time to figure out how the game and controls work and it will be smooth sailing from there.  Controls with an xbox360 controller are just as they were on ye old console Ace Combat games.It's in early access but I haven't come across any bugs.  All I see that needs improvement is graphics refinement (a sharp grey circle for sun glare?? come on!!) and maybe content addition, both of which will come in time.Very few flight combat games can match the quality and feel of Ace Combat (and lets face it, most flight games downright suck) but Vector Thrust is the closest you can get to an Ace Combat feel.  After playing for about an hour I see it has a LOT of potential to dethrone Ace Combat, and I hope it does, since Namco has just about trashed the Ace Combat franchise and isn't listening to their fans.  For that reason, I think this game is very well worth the $20 price tag.			"

												I grew up playing Chuck Yeager's Air Combat and later on TFX, so my opinion here is biased, but I love arcade sims. I had been eyeing this game for some time, and when it was in a humble bundle I pulled the trigger. While it's not a AAA title but for what it is, it's really good. Graphics - the aircraft are absolutely grogeous. The landscapes and terrains, are ugly.Story -While I must give credit to the developers for creating a post apocalyptic world scenario, so far the story isn't all that interesting.Crashes - I guess I would say the crashes on thi game are on the higher side. So a lot of games crash, I would say the current state is similar to the initial release of a Bethesda game.Aircraft variety - A huge variety of aircraft, that I'm just starting to unlock. Starting with a lot of Vietnam era aircraft including the Phantom and Fishbed, to modern aircraft. I haven't gotten quite far enough to know how far into the modern aircraft they go. Th aircraft do free different, and in the challlenge mode, as you unlock the different variants you get to learn about the history of the development of the various aircraft. This game was my biggest reason for purchasing the humble bundle, but I'm an extremely cheap gamer so you probably shouldn't take how much I would pay for it seriously, but I do think it was worth it.

												Main game play is good and fun when it doesnt crash for no likely reason. Multiplayer was promised but never materialized. Ther is a join lobby tab that is always greyed out. You make your own lobby nobody joins because their join lobby is greyed out. But other than that it plays just fine. Should be a free download in my opinion. Sorry i got suckered in by the good reviews online. Oviously the devs had a lot of freinds online to make the game look good. The game has now been more or less abanndoned the devs making updates that absolutly do nothing to fix or change gameplay. Think they added some aircraft. Dont know why when you wont be able to use them in anything but battle scenario. So if you like getting told you are getting a finished game think twice about getting this one.			"

												Another game that is Early Access and incomplete rushed out the door for no clear sane reason except trying to get a few dollars more.It has a lot of potential to be a great Arcade dog fighter and I have been eagerly waiting for it to be finished.Sadly it is indeed incomplete and not a full game , something the devs have even admitted and still has bugs that should not be in a game that is full release.For example change the language from 'default' to 'English' and all mode except Quick Action will make it crash. If you're firing your gun when the round ends the gun sound gets stuck, controller suport in menu is janky and not that smooth with game control either.Feels like the game uses it like a 4 way controller not 8 way, meaning turning your plane while climbing or diving is not smooth and has that clicky feel.The game and menus still have that in development look and feel.So I cannot in good concience at this time recommend it, if it were still in early access I would of said go for it.Best I can do now though is say keep an eye on it and reviews to see if it ever gets finished, as sadly experience with Early Access on Steam has shown me once a game is pushed out unfinished like this it's usually not long after the title is completely abandoned.Again, very dissapointing the devs and publisher decided to go this route. Hope they prove me wrong and we get a complete and polished game.			"

								ENG:Just amazing to see in this game that looks like an old familiar from the original ""Air Combat"" they look new video game, which has been revamped and made ââa number of new ideas to the old interface and gameplay. The game gives the opportunity to use and buy and sell aircraft without any restrictions, including the game's story time. Unlike many other similar games, you are forced to play the story for Specially particles airplane use, but this is not mandatory. When playing a game you can also open up more new aircraft to use, which you can buy for your self later in the store. Also the weapons you can buy the game for himself on an airplane, which could not be done earlier in a older game. The game also has the battle arena, where you can also set the number of planes and severity. Also, the number of own aircraft and the skills to adjust to keep you in the game. The game also supports modding.even if the game crashes a few times, so I can still recommend this game!  One of the best if not the best to play flight combat simulations. Includes also ââa map editor.

								Brings back the Ace Combat nostalgia in full force with a selection of jets ranging from the mundane to the exotic, some of which I had no idea even existed before trying this game. As a huge plus it works wonderfully with PC Joysticks, something that Ace Combat: Assault Horizon can't claim.However on a down side the campaign content is very much a work in progress and the voice acting is rather odd... however considering it's an early access game I am not put out by this and consider it to be well worth the investment now just for the excellent gameplay.

								After having flown a lot in War Rock and Battlefield 2, I have waited long for a game like this. It is a great game to play while listening to music, documentaries, podcasts etc. The only thing I miss so far is the ability to control the plane using a mouse, as in the previously mentioned games. While it is possible to reconfigure the controls to fly with a mouse, the control is hardly smooth, and sensitivity waaay too low for me (and as far as I can tell impossible to alter yet). I am forced to use wasd and arrows, which I find far less enjoyable. Still great for an early access game.			"

								This game feels like Air Combat (PSX), Ace Combat 2(PSX),3(PSX), and 4 (PS2) all put into one title, plus when they add counter measures it might be up to par with leathel skies 2(PS2), but the damage system is still Air Combat like.  The only things missing are gunships and Heat Seeker's kill cams and you could get one hell of a game.Needs some more game modes for multiplayer but as an Early Access purchase It has enough content to keep you busy for hours.  Plus a map editor that allows you to build your own missions and game maps thats a plus in my book.  The game is open ended for modding I believe and has a huge line up of airplanes ranging from Fantasy to Real Aircarft.Other issues are the high pitched voices (can be turned off but devs are fixing with more voice actors) Dumb missles (arcade missle system, if it misses target first time it flys off into distance, could or might be adjusted to suit new countermeasure system) Missles that lock onto targets and don't track due to not right type of target (anti ship missle sometimes flys off if not right target). But to justify your purchase this is an Early Access game more content is on its way. So if you want to wait till it further develops then hold on to your cash and see where it goes but if you can't wait to play it buy it today not shabby title for $14.99(USD).I give this game a 9.5 out of 10.Edit 11/2/14: Map editor is extremely easy to use once you figure out the menus. You can make maps like a pro using the in game tool.  Still yet to figure out all of the controls and some features are wonky but Early Access game has time to be fixed before launch, still worth the $14.99 pledge.			"

Early Access Review
								I'll start off with the negative: The game is very much incomplete right now. There's placeholder text in areas and some of the challenges don't work properly. In addition, the CCIP / bombsight does not work at all, and GBU's often won't land where they're supposed to, There's also major problems with volume on certain sounds (lock tone is a big one), and the sound effects in general are fairly dull at the moment.With that out of the way, Vector Thrust is already incredibly fun to play, and the AOA limiter feature is great, even if it's not supposed to be available on all aircraft. Textures are currently very muddy (think PS2-style), but the aircraft are gorgeously rendered in that cel shaded style. The music is pretty generic but also not bad; I'd put it about on the same level as Ace Combat X2's music production value. In the game, there are currently a number of very interesting variations and experimental versions of each of the aircraft available, and while it's obviously not finished yet, the progression in unlocking these feels natural.With the extensive modding support already being taken advantage of on ModDB, I can't wait to see what can be added to the game. Campaigns in particular are something that offers a limitless amount of user-generated content within the game's engine while remaining fairly accessible.If you're a fan of Ace Combat or similar games, definitely give Vector Thrust a go. Now. If not, wait til it's not quite as rough and then give it a go. It's a ton of fun either way.			"

												*Highly recommend a joy stick or gamepad, the keyboard controls are disorienting*I discovered this game and instantly decided I needed it in my collection. The unique art style as well as the ""arcade"" gameplay really sold it to me. It brings back memories of Ace Combat 4 Shattered Skies, which has a similar arcade style, and if you played Ace Combat 4 then you'll definitely feel at home with this title. The campaign was alright and there are only 2 other scenario missions to play afterward, but the various airplane family challenge missions are what really rack in the hours. This game features 260 flyable airplanes, many of which you must unlock through the challenge missions. I've logged 17 hours and only have 25% of the aircraft unlocked! One feature I though was genuine and cool was all the facts included about each individual airplane in each family. The game states the classification of the airplane (prototype, fictional, concept, mass production), year manufactured, and some history about the plane. I also found it neat that for the challenge missions you start out with the first ""version"" of the airplane, whether it be a prototype or concept, and work your way up to the most advanced variant of the airplane, which may be fictional. It's a great way to learn all the airplane variants. All in all this is a great game and I know I'll be playing it for quite a while, who knows what gems the challenge mode might contain. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys military airplanes, dogfighting, or Ace Combat. Maybe if this game picks up players, there will be massive online dogfights. Until then, keep em flying pilots, Over nâ out. "

												I don't know whose idea it was to make it so you have to HOLD the missile launch button to keep missile lock after firing, but it was an awful idea. Remember how fun it was in Ace Combat to pop off two missiles in quick succession and move on to the next target before they hit, enabling very rapid combo kills? You don't get that here. It's utterly boring.I don't know if maybe the later planes in the game fly more nimbly but I don't remember the first planes of any AC game flying this freaking stiff. I feel like I'm turning a turret. The camera is too high of an FOV, so distance is impossible to judge based on looks like you could back in 4/5/Zero. Usually I like a high FOV but this is cutting it close. It would be nice if I could use the distance counter that's right next to your target as a reference, but the text is WHITE on a WHITE sky, making it unreadable. You can barely see your own missiles as well.The visuals are meh. The cel shading and realistic ground textures don't match up at all. The cockpit visuals are still not finished, and honestly I think they've been given up on completely, since the POV cycling only has one first person view now.If you're an Ace Combat fan and want to buy this, dont. If you REALLY wanna buy it, get it on sale. I got this a long time ago while it was still Early Access, and frankly it still should be in EA. I gambled on the potential of this game and I lost. Basically everything about this game is awful and unfinished.EDIT: I played with a cheapâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥HOTAS i got at a thrift store for a buck. (a Top Gun Thrustmaster II, if yr curious) and it did help with control SOMEWHAT, but not much. Also, the final objective of the first mission is to leave the airspace by heading towards a waypoint at the edge of the map, but if you head to it too fast? You fail the mission because you left the airspace. Holy damn this is awful.			"

												Review for the first released version.Dear TS. I like the old Main menu theme song better. This new one just doesn't feel right :<The two place-holder campaign no longer exist (And i almost finished buying all planes on them). Instead, there's the finished campaign. And it features visual-novel like cutscene telling the story of the pilots. [Spoilers] I've only played the first mission. But the airliner i was supposed to protect pulled some sick move and even try to mow down the enemy fighters. I lol'd [\Spoilers]Other than that, this is a dream come true for those who have only been only playing Ace Combat Infinity on youtube like me.Think of this as a M.U.G.E.N. for Ace Combat. You can add a lot of aircrafts made by the awesome community.The AI are really good to play against. They'll learn your tricks, and then you'll constantly have to watch your six. They also addapt to the planes you added. This makes Instant Action mode sometimes very challenging. Click on it and pray to god that the AI doesn't pick a ADFX-01, a CFA-44 to go against you.To sum up the moments: This is the only game where you'll see Lt. Rei Fukai and his Super Sylph dances in front of an angry Pixy in his ADFX-01 Morgan, while EDI is having a hard time evading you in a F-104 Starfighter. But then everyone blows up because a random â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ with a Fenrir managed to hit someone with a LSWM.The Challenge mode is fun to play. It'll be hard (or is it because i'm bad?). But you can still play on other mode to gain credits then Buy all of those aircraft. It'll unlock the aircrafts in other modes.Ran out of fuel on ACI? Still want more of those DM, TDM events? You can boot this game up and have a go with many AI in the Skirmish mode. Mobydick Pursuit? There's the ZiZ hunt. Not as awesomely intense, but it does the trick for me.This is a great game. There're still places for improvements, but i already have too much fun with the current stage. And TS says there will be more. At the moment, the price tag is pretty high for an unfinished game. But i believe TS will make it so it's worth every penny you spent.9/10 - Will definately become better.			"

												Oh, Vector Thrust... whatever happened to you? Back when Desura wasn't bankrupt, there was a small pocket of buzz surrounding Vector Thrust and how it might be the salvation for those of us who grew up on the Ace Combat series. As of this review, the only Ace Combat game to release on PCs was Ace Combat: Assault Horizon, which has divided reception. Anyone who didn't have Sony consoles were hoping for some PC flight action arcade game in the vein of the series, and that's what Vector Thrust was aiming for.Unfortunately, it aimed too high and completely missed its target - nothing but air. The in-game mission editor is a complete mess, the only playable campaign missions included with the game are buggy disasters, multiplayer seems to have a switch that flips on or off whenever the game is updated, and the game just doesn't run correctly. Since its beta launch on Steam, Vector Thrust repeatedly crashes to the desktop for a variety of reasons, from incorrect aircraft skin references to missing or renamed dialogue files.Don't even get me started on the lack of a fully-functioning settings menu, whose settings keep getting reset every time the game is updated. And that doesn't even include the audio that keeps failing to work for some people, which, surprise surprise, crashes the game. The only saving grace about Vector Thrust is its soundtrack, which was outsourced to a damn good indie composer. The aircraft selection would also be a really good feature of the game, if it wasn't for the fact that the hundreds of different airframes that are basically the same thing end up being overwhelming.There's a big discussion about whether the fault lies with the developer or the publisher for Vector Thrust's failures. Honestly, if you're reading these reviews, that's not what matters to you. What matters is that this game is not worth any sum of money. It's unstable, it's a disaster, and it failed to do what it set out to do. If you're interested in this flight action arcade genre, your best bet is to purchase Ace Combat 7 when it comes out on Steam in 2017. You could also try emulating the PlayStation 2 Ace Combat games, or just get a PlayStation 2 and copies of the games. Even Assault Horizon would be better than this when it's on sale - and that's saying something.			"

												Should have copied AC controls verbatim. Nothing else comes close for a reason.EDIT:My knee jerk reaction was 'bleh not as good as AC'. The controls took a while to get used to; I'd accustomed to the clunky controls by the time I unlocked another plane and discovered that the planes flight models ranged from super responsive to god awful brick. I'm talking more of a difference than a Berkut and a A6-E in AC games. I personally would have started the player off with an F-4G. Despite my coming to grips with the controls (which are rebindable) I still do not recommend VT. - Bugs galore. The message for < HIT > or < MISS > comes up even when not relevant to my own armament. Dialog skips itself. Briefings are missing. The right shop doesn't always load. etc.- You thought dancing with angels was bad? Mmm. - Menus seem to require an xbox controller, keyboard, and mouse all working together to navigate. Maybe I am just noob, but I couldn't do everything with just the one input device. - The boresight needs a lot of work. Sort of defeats the purpose when it's just as frustrating as cycling global targets. - Game crashes frequently and inconsistently. This is the biggest gripe. - Briefings are skippable, cutscenes don't seem to be. - Ground textures are worse than ACX.All in all, a great effort from you Dev, but I'm dissapointed by the little things. Sorry I was so harsh with my original review.			"

												Unfortrently, i can't recommend this game yet, this is something i'd strongly suggest putting on your watch list and buying it later. I feel as if the game has been released a little too early and there are still issues from the Early Access still plaguing today, due to what appears to be the publisher making the developer release the game earlier than he would like it. I'd wait a few months down the line and see what kind of shape the game will be then, it still feels very ""Early Access"", even though it's been ""fully released"". Honestly, I'm not too sure what to think about Vector Thrust right now, and it would require more experementation to figure out what the key issues is, if you come expecting this to be a direct Ace Combat clone, you will run into a few problems since the game doesnt play like a direct Ace Combat clone. I don't think it helps that your starting planes are so low tier that you won't have a real clue on how the flying feels like until you go through challanges to unlock each plane seperately, and there are a lot of aircraft to unlock, perhaps too much at a glance. Plus, there are some challanges that are either just pure broken or harder than it should be, that doesnt really help things.I think whats throwing so many people off is that its not a direct Ace Combat clone, because of that. You end up playing this in the Ace Combat mindset and it ends up backfiring. This might have something to do with the flight model, or the planes. Or just the game in general. I'm not too sure.Let me do a proper review in the future, i'd really need to put more time into it but as of right now. I really can't recommend buying this right now, especially with the asking price being nearly Â£20, in the state that its in right now. Sorry, TimeSymmetry. I really didnt want to give you a negative review right now, seeing how you've been working on this since mid 2011, and what you have done is great. But it's still got some blatent issues that still show that Early Access mark, i hope you can fix up the game more in the future so it feels like a proper released game. I'll review the game near the end of the year and we'll see what happens then.			"

												i havent had to much time with this game , but im enjoying it. the game had so much that it could be and i hope the Devs make it there-pros-over all it reminds me over Ace Combat.-the story is good and the charaters are fun (from what i have played so far)-the world that you are in is cool and something new.-the texureing of the plans is cool and kinda remind me of anime some how , over all i like it.-the combat is alright-i havent run in to a any bugs (other than it crashing now and than)-cons (this game is still being made so)-updates seem to be slow (im not really sure on this)-the AI plans will kick yourâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥if you let them lock on to you.-the game's graphics seem basic for a PC game (with the buildings on the ground , it feels more like a Ps2 game or something)-the controls for the game are kinda weird and it only uses the keybored (the mouse is for looking around) and as far as i know there isnt mouse flight.-diolog cuts off now and than , and dosent match the text all the time.-this weird glitch where the russian planes are good.Over all i am loving this game , but im not sure if its worth the full price at the moment (i got it off of â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥) it could be a amazaing game and had a lot of good starts at the moment , i just hope the Devs keep on it and listen to the commuinty.i have high hopes.as of buying this game , i would say if you have the money sure , but i would get it when its on sale or something like that. (25 bucks might be to much) "

								its Ace combat with a different style, different name, and a whole fleet of planes. I played ace combat since i was a little kid, it grew up with me until now. its a shame that there's no good flight arcade on PC nowadays (HAWX2 Is pretty Decent ish, ACAH is just Call of duty with planes.) but this, this is a masterpiece made by a single person, A SINGLE PERSON. He made a spiritual sucessor of a legendary game by himself. not to mention there's an active modding community too! Its still an ""Advanced Alpha"" game, but hell, it improves as time go on. i remember when this game has many bugs, but now, its not!It have plane skins and sound replacement mods, so you can play with Ace combat 3 Hud sounds, while Flying a MIG-33SS with an UPEO Skin. and aslo pretend you're playing an ace combat game. it's very good to see an arcade-ish flight game in the midst of Simulator here and there (i dont hate sims, i liked them.)if you like....-planes-ace combat-cel shading-air to air combat with mutators (instagib with planes!)-moddable game-Arcade style gamesBuy this.

Give it a Try, you gonna love it,but take it easy with the bugs because it will crash a bit on you,just be warned.			"

								While it's very clearly still a work in progress, it's hard to not recommend this title. Why? It's effectively cel-shaded ace combat for the PC. The voice acting needs work (sound in general does), and if you don't detest the F-104 family by the time you're done with the challenges you're kind of strange, but other than that, for the price point (and keeping in mind it's not finished) it's a solid title.

												Short version: Abandoned early-access game Long version:I'm going to start this off by saying I really wanted to reccomend this game. After so many years without a new Ace Combat game (and no, Assault Horizon was not an Ace Combat game; it just had the label slapped on), I was excited when this came out of early access. Starting off with the good: this game has a massive selection of aircraft, both real and fictional. Like, it's huge. The gameplay is also good: combat flows well and the controls feel like they should. It also has a single campaign which has a pretty standard arc of ""no-name pilot nobody's heard of turning the tide of a conflict to become a famous ace""This game has a ton of promise, and a lot of potential. It was in early access for a long time, and there was nearly constant feedback by the devs showing their progress. There was very steady progress, but eventually the publishers forced the devs to release early. Despite this, the devs acknowledged that it wasn't complete, and promised continual updates until it was done.The last update was in summer 2016, described as a ""quick update,"" and no dev has posted on the discussion board since then either. If you really want this one, I wouldn't pay the full $25 for it: it's just not finished. Definitely wait for a sale. Besides, with the upcoming announcement of Ace Combat 7, it's better to hold onto your pursestrings and wait for that.			"

												normally i really hate to leave negative reviews because i feel that all developers that know they only made a half game will finish it. But as an air simulator developer my self and part of the development of many air sims (india devs) i see it hard for this game to ever be finished, its like they update it every month but the update only works for a decent amount of people. becuase my version dont seems to get any of all the features that shows in the updates log, and they seems to have been laying a huge amount of their time in the aircraft development and skins but somehow they never make it to the game? normally this is the best part of an arcade aircraft game, but why make new planes when the old ones or the games basics isn't even half done yet? it is like battlefield 4 that were making new dlc's even through half the game was buggy and unfinished, they did fininsh f the game now however after alot of people complained. my solid point is, i think this game was made of people like me that loves aircraft games and wanted to make their own, to conmtrol it and keep it alive, but where they seperate from me is that i complete the things i began and dont stop before it is 100% ready. ( and no i will not post any links to the games i developed or been helping with as that is against the steam policy to promote other products) been following it since alpha release on steam and were following it, on moddb when they first began, were afraid to buy it on moddb as it looked like a casual half done work but when it came on steam i had to try this out, because steam's policy was quite good when this game came on here, but to end this reviewIt is a decent game, but too overpriced compared to it stability and development, and many other flight sims can be released before this actually gets out of an real alpha state, because this is not a full release or a beta, and i know that. but try it out on a sale you will enjoy it for 4-5 hours and that is it, And no it doesn't look like ACE COMBAT at all, and i've been in contact with them for a long time and been a fan of their games, since 1998  "

Early Access Review
 The casual Steam review: It's Ace Combat with cel-shaded graphics plus other stuff AC (not Assassin's Creed nor Armored Core, mind you) doesn't have! Would shoot down airborne fortresses again 10/10 The classical review: Vector Thrust is an incredibly well made game even though it is still incomplete. Nevertheless, the fundamentals are already there, namely the dogfighting mechanics that we all love in arcade simulators like Ace Combat and HAWX. The game features tons of jets, from the ubiquitous oh-so-advanced F-22 (and its variants) to the more odd-looking prototypes such as the Hopeless Diamond (try to guess its shape ;) ). Currently the campaign mode is a little bit basic as there are 2 short campaigns as of now, but there are other modes as well. A Challenge Mode (featuring various combat scenarios) is available to unlock aircraft for modes outside the campaigns, namely a Quick Battle mode that picks random scenarios one after another and a Skirmish mode that allows you to choose specific parameters, such as time of day, number of AI, unique modifiers and win conditions for the game.Manoeuvring each type of plane feels tight much like Shattered Skies/Distant Thunder, and there is a toggle to turn off the angle of attack limiter that causes an increase in manoeuverability (and allows you to perform aerobatic stunts) at a cost of siphoning your plane's HP with every super sharp turn you make.There is a healthy variety in the weapons, as the stats of the guns and 'normal' missiles can differ from one plane to another. For example, some planes might have a gun with a rapid rate of fire, but can overheat if fired for too long. Other planes with slower firing guns (which don't overheat) meant that there is always a chance that your shots will miss especially when tracking a plane doing a sharp turn. And then there's SP weapons...The music is as good as those in other big budget titles, but the voice acting is a little hit and miss especially when the spoken lines do not match the in-game subtitles. Voices also sound quite funny at times, and the lines are somewhat informal to be spoken by military pilots especially in the non-campaign modes.The AI can be described as brilliant at times, especially when they do various manoeuvres to throw you off their tail and when they manage to trick your missiles into hitting the ground by flying low. At their worst they are best described as suicidally insane, crashing into the ground whenever they feel like it although the prevalence of deaths by suicide in AI pilots is kinda low.Although the game features cel-shaded graphics, each plane is lovingly detailed with numerous panel lines and the landscape looks alright when viewed from faraway. The water looks off, but the splashes it makes when a stray ordnance hits it look good.Unfortunately, game-crashing bugs may be present as expected in an alpha, but the probability of these events are very small that you can still enjoy this game from time to time.Much recommended. Get it.			"

								Yes, Vector Thrust is an arcade. You can fly with large variety of planes and you've got more more misales than usual munition depo. BUT!!! Compared to all HAWX like games from last years its flight sim :-) well it is not but it is great fun.Here are reason why I love this game:1. XF-104!!! StarFighter based planes are my livelong long and finaly i can flight one of them (outside MS Flight Simulator).2. Flight model. Well it is and arcade and you can do backflip with A-10. But:  a) All planes behave bifferent. In HAWX I had a fealing that all planes are same, here it absolutely different.  b) All planes bahave as you would expect from them. A-10 is lazy, XF-104 is unstable and so on.3. To hit something with a misale you actualy have to get to right position. Not like HAWX where you can fire from 130Â° angle and hit.Do not get me wrong I ve spended a lot of time with Hawx it was a bit difficult to control them with my X52 PRO (it felt like joystick is to sensitive for this game), but it was great fun. But this game it is BRILIANT.When I have whole afternoon for flying I fly Flight Simulator X. When I have 2 hours after work, when my son i sleeping and wife watching TV, I fly Vector Thrust.			"

												In regards to the other reviews, this game doesn't seem to be *intended* to be a ""replacement"" or be a ""clone"" of the AAA title Ace Combat. ^.^""With that said, this game is obviously inspired by it, and as a non-Ace Combat player and w/o expectation-bias, I honestly say this game is not broken, IT JUST ISN'T FINISHED. :(Don't buy this game expecting Ace Combat-esque experience, it will not deliver, but it shows a good foundation on its own flavour, and it shows potential! \^0^/!!=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=Development is really SLOW, but......the parts that are done are SOLID.Missions/battle/radio and briefing voiceover is GOOD, not bad just occasionaly 'corny', but......the story scenes(still-image arts) voiceover are kinda 'corny' and 'just there' though.combat isn't as good as Ace Combat, but........combat is decent as of this writing(most are at standoff range, guns are still useful though, it and missile mechanics seem okay)(flares and chaffs mechanics add to the modern-A2A-combat immersion)last is NO CAMERA EFFECTS(which is the flavour of Ace Combat that adds intensity to the fights)=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=A decent & inspired(you could feel it ^_^) indie game that forgot to tag in EARLY ACCESS :3 RECOMMENDED! ^o^(y)!!

												Fans of the Ace Combat series can rejoice, Vector Thrust is a faithful homage to the arcade flight series while delivering fresh content of its own. A lot of reviewers complained of the missile lock system so the developers have implemented a feature allowing players to choose between the classic missile mode and the new improved mode which near duplicates Ace Combat's lock and fire approach. I elected to play with this mode. The game boasts a lot of aircraft including some not in the Ace Combat series and a passable story befitting of the genre; an alternate reality military/science fiction. My biggest complaints would probably be the sound quality and the lack of a detailed cockpit view.			"

If you wanted something like Ace Combat or Hawx, is not here, the game is unforgiving and the challenge is hardcore. One shot and you are dead."" I like the cel-shade graphic and don't mind the poor ground texture. I only need one request, easy mode, tougher allies and escorts. Is kinda disheartening to see the last enemy shoot down your allies, wasting nearly 30 minutes of dogfight and missle dodging.........

												Ok, so here's the deal. On paper, this game is great. It's got a ""large"" selection of planes, from  what I see it has 3-5 gen. aircraft. And it looks like a looney toon version of classic Ace Combat (a simcade flying game from Playstation and Xbox). When it works it is fun and quite challenging (missle shots seem to miss a lot here).However this game is very buggy and it crashes. It's also incomplete. Here's my pro/con. list:Pros.1. Plays like ace combat.2. Has a decent selection of weapons/aircraft.3. A somewhat engaging storyline for an indie game.Cons.1. Voice  bugs (Sometimes the characters litterally scream in your ear too loud) or sometimes they are way way too quiet.2. Sound glitches, again the warning sounds and ambient sounds are glitchy and sometimes too quiet or way the hell too loud.3. Campaign is incomplete. You cannot get past mission 11-10? where you kill the prince... all that is left are invisible targets theres no completion. Inotherwords you cannot progress pass that.4. Model glitches, from hud view your plane is invisible (you only see your weapons).This game feels incomplete. So unfortunately I cannot recommend this game, unless they finish it by fixing the bugs.			"

												As a bigtime fan of the Ace Combat series and flight sims/arcade games in general, I really want this game to be good.The polish is just not there. Campaign mission design is atrocious (escort a dude out of the airspace in a straight line with no action for 5 minutes).The music is irritating, sounds like FSX stock music or something.The in-game cel-shaded graphics are beautiful though, sadly the same can't be said about the lackluster menus.I really love what they were going for and to be honest I hope many more follow this path, but sadly Vector Thrust does not deliver.

								The one outstanding feature of Vector Thust is the original music score. The devs really hit this one out of the park; not only is it nice to listen to, but it also fits perfectly with the overall theme this is one- and so far (sadly) the only- feature I feel has really been nailed.Gameplay. What's it like? While it can be satisfying in the correct circumstances, those are far too few and far between. In terms of the aircraft, there is a sweet spot in their mobility where they are just manouverable enough so that you don't feel like you are flying a bus, but not so agile that they are uncontrollable to mere mortals. Far too many aircraft in game fall on either side of this sweet spot, making them un fun to fly, especially when you are forced to for lack of viable alternatives. The Campaign. In a word: unfinnished. There is a near total lack of story telling, making it feel like a series of random missions. This is not helped by a complete lack of voice acting, which is important in making the player get to know their wingman and other charecters. In addition, both campaigns are very short, with no obvious continuity between them. This, however, seems the most fixable of all the games issues, provided it is not overlooked.As for the art style, that is clearly subjective and opinions will vary from person to person. Cell shading to me, however, feels like it is used either so that it is not necessary to create more realistic looking planes, or as a way for the game to make itself stand out, at the expense of the overall experience. tl;dr: This game has potential, however it needs lots of work before it becomes worthy of your cash.

												I have to recommend this game. It has it's fair share of things that need to be fixed; typos, dialogue not matching subtitles, etc. but the game plays wonderfully. Every time I find myself on the computer I play this game for at leasta  skirmish match. The modding community is very active, with many things from Ace Combat and Yukikaze finding their way into VT. To be honest, the only thing I don't like is the lack of a hangar plane selection screen in skirmish. (You can actually take planes straight out of the unpilotable categories and put them in the 'Airplane' folder, thus enabling them for skirmish and scenarios, and you can edit the game's main campaign and add what planes you wish to use.)ALSO: If you want to pick your targets carefully, use the boresight lock-on, don't use the 'change target' key. I believe boresight is CTRL?			"

												This is more like Ace Combat than Ace Combat Assault Horizon.  I'd give it a 7.5/10 in its current state.Given the fact it was created on a microscopic budget compared to Ace Combat,  it is probably one of the closest ""clones"" that you'll find on the PC.  The game itself could use tweaking on dog fighting, environments are fairly bland, campaign mode could use a little more initiative and depth, and it is hit or miss on air craft selection.  Some air craft will actually perform differently than variant counterparts whilst others are more or less cosmetic/pallette swaps with a different variant name.  I've spent more than my recorded online time playing this as I play a great deal of games offline.  This one has a pretty large aircraft selection regardless of the swaps.  I'd recommend this to anyone who loves arcade style flying games such as Air Combat.  You can tell the love for this game and genre of game is there with this dev and if this dev makes a few tweaks on some fairly basic issues (in other words polish this bad boy) and continues to show it love, this has the possiblilty of a 8.5-9.0/10 rating in my book.

								If you love Ace Combat, fast paced cel-shading action or simply you weren't good enough to join the Air Force, then Vector Thrust is the game for you! Sure, there are some very minor issues but still is a very enjoyable game! Also, on ModDb there are s*itloads of mods and skin packs from real life USAF or IAF squadrons to the fictional Ustio or ISAF plus some other various themed skin pack. Oh yes, the gameplay is balanced enough to give you a different dogfight every time you want, so if during the last game you played against potato level pilots, be aware that in the next game you may encounter Satan's jet.In the end, I really reccomend you this little masterpiece!Highway to the Danger Zone/ 10 would buzz the tower again!

								This game is currently incomplete, but so far the technical accuracy is great. At this time it only has a handful of aircraft, but it's very selective in the balance between RL accuracy and balanced gameplay.My only complaint in the style of the game thusfar, is the speed of it. The planes fly like bricks, all turning VERY slowly. The result is it doesn't have the twitchy fast paced combat I'm looking for, and very few manuevers will throw an opponent properly, because they're all so slow and easy to follow. That said, I am eager to see what this game will become, $15 being a very good price if it lives up to its POTENTIAL.			"

Early Access Review
								It is definenty good as is for right now. It is very reminesant to Ace Combat 5 and 6 in the fact that the play styles are very similar. The graphics are close to that of Borderlands style art and graphics. There is a bit of pixilization here and there but nothing to damning. But the game does have a few drawbacks. Some of the controls are a tad chunky such as the yaw. The game does lack any cockpit views as of the latest release. And it is lacking of a defined story. There are ""campains"" in the game but they are like the campains found in the Air Combat series, a list of unafiliated missions that lack a real story arc. I know it is still in early access and there is likely more to come. But there are also some technical issues found in it as well. The f-22 has no listed weapons other than the basic missles. In reality it carries tons of munitions in its bays and on external mounts.The SU-47 is a bit overpowered and is a bit too fast compaired to the other jets here. The original P.125 ECR had a gun system in its original plans.That is about it, I would like to see some cockpit views and a fictional plane tossed in for fun. Then why did i recommend the game if it is lacking in these elements? Because it is not quite finished yet, hence the early access; this thing has a butt-load of potential that can make it the best thing in combat simulators since Ace Combat 5. And it is likey the best one that you can find on Steam as of right now. AC Combat Horizon is a joke and HAWX 2 is a disapointment. If this does prove to be what i think it can be, then it will blow both of those out of the water.			"

												I went in to see what kind of changes they made to the game since I played it last, which was almost a year ago and I was surprised and disappointed that the game felt exactly the same. The one thing I could say is that the graphics are much better, but not much else is. Maybe that will change, I don't know. All I can say is that when I got it for $10 I didn't feel remorse for my purchase and I still don't. Seeing the $25 price tag now, though, makes me think that if I got it now instead of then, I'd definitely feel buyer's remorse.			"

												Vector Thrust is an Ace combat clone that doesn't understand what made Ace Combat fun in the first place. If I had to sum it up in one word: Tedious.   The missions are long, boring, grinds that see you thrown up against seemingly endless waves of enemy fighters; which would be great if the combat was in any way enjoyable or varied.  The frusterating, overly-long missions lack checkpoints, targeting enemies involves cycling through every single target on the map (no prioritiziation based on range), and your missiles are nearly inneffective against manuvering targets.  You're better off dragging your PS2 out of the closet, or buying one from a thrift store, and playing the real thing.  "

												This game is beyond awful in its current state. Somehow, Timesymmetry managed to turn a rather competent but somewhat uninspired Ace Combat clone into a buggy, unplayable mess.Literally nothing works as intended. The campaign missions are fundamentally broken, to the point where you will see passenger airliners trying to dogfight with enemy fighters. The multiplayer is somehow even worse, with frequent crashes, disconnects and all round bugginess. A particular joy is that the game will allow you to try to join a multiplayer session with a modded aircraft, causing the game to crash for everyone connected to the server. The cel shading style leaves the aircraft looking like they were waxed to a mirror shine because the specular maps are dreadful. Missiles are effectively useless. Flight dynamics are horrendous, even for an arcade flight game. Avoid like the plague.			"

												I can not and will not say this game is perfect in any way, shape, or form whatsoever. I'll say it up front, this is a buggy, crash-ridden game with a lot of half-baked content in it. There are a bunch of aircraft in the game you've probably never even heard of, and unlocking them is a pain in theâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥all the way through.The campaign isn't bad, nothing new or interesting, but not bad. It's like being a regular at a restaurant and ordering something good that you normally get. It doesn't push any bars, but it isn't awful. The only part of it that bugs me is the voice-acting, which needs some work. Everyone sounds disinterested, though the lore of the world itself is pretty interesting from what the campaign tells you.The gameplay is mostly trial-and-error. Once you learn the controls and spend some time beating the AI that tries so very hard to shoot you down even at lower levels, there's actually some meaning behind the consistent 'heroic'-sounding music that plays 24/7 while you're running down MiGs and bombers with your machine gun. Vector Thrust takes a lot from Ace Combat when it comes to boss encounters, you've got experimental superplanes and flying aerial battleships mixed in with the standard fighter jet fare.There's also an Editor mode, for those interested in making their own missions. This is what's got me sucked in for the most part. I've spent a fair amount of time on this thing, and still haven't figured out all these fancy commands and functions yet. It's also where I've gotten the most crashes, mostly from trying to make xbox heug scenarios.WOULD I RECOMMEND THIS GAME?Vector Thrust is still a very buggy, buggy mess. I don't personally believe that it should be out of Early Access at the moment, because a lot of people would pick this up and spit on it after about 10 minutes. Unfortunately, I've been sucked in with 50 hours of my life taken from this game way back in Early Access, and honestly have grown quite fond of it despite the flaws. It's not perfect, but it's fun to screw around with if you're a fan of arcade flight sims.If you're unwilling to spend $25 on a game that still has a long way to go in development, don't go for this. But if you want to appease your inner 'Maverick' and don't mind a game that's still very much a Beta, Vector Thrust is worth a try.			"

												I'd like to first off say that this is me only being part way through the campaign and having done only one challenge, with no mods. That said - If you're a fan of classic Ace Combat games 4/5 or prior, please don't let the negetive reviews discourage you from getting this game (but please don't buy it for 25$, get it on sale or in a bundle, or from a third party site as I did for mere dimes.)It's a solid, very good quality dogfighter and feels VERY reminiscent of past Ace Combat games, from the layout of  certain things, to the way certain actors talk, to the way certain menus work, to the way the story is told, it's incredible how much it feels like Ace Combat 04 without being Ace Combat 04.Yes, the game is FULLLLLL of glitches, but none I have run into are very major. It's mostly spelling mistakes (lots of em) and the fact that sometimes voice segments and dialogue don't match, or that sometimes dialogue won't play but the subtitles show, or sometimes dialogue segments cut off other ones unexpectedly. It's mostly minor things, as I said. With those in mind, think back to Ace Combat 04/5, some of these were pretty common in those games, right? It's not an excuse for this game to have them, but you should realize that not every game will be perfect when it's so full of content.The story is a bit confusing, but so far it's pretty decent. Campaign mode works well for me so far, but I do get random acheivments that I know I haven't earned, which is ok, I don't play for acheivments anyways. If you do, try to stay away from this game until there's some sort of fix, if there ever is.The planes are a bit poor on the sensetivity, and people have complained that they have a hard time controlling them, but they're playing with a mouse and keyboard, which of course will be hard to fly in. Ever tried flying a jet in Arma 3 with a keyboard? It's pretty hard, but manageable, and I think that describes this game's controlls pretty well. ""Similar to Arma 3.""The graphics (plane and menus, try not to pay attention to the ground textures too much) are phenominal, and remind me of animes with overly-detailed firearms and girls in skimpy outfits. Realistic and cartoonish at the same time. The cel-shading was a very good style choice for this game and fits very well.The music is pretty good, but I usually play the Ace Combat 04 OST in the background because it was a damn good soundtrack, and while this one's good, it sometimes gets repetetive.I LOVE how the story is told. If you've played Ace Combat 04 (dunno about other ones) you'll remember what I'm talking about. After each mission, you get a bit of art to look at while your squad talks amongst themselves and to their base commrades, etc. It's a wonderful way of story telling, but I do wish there was more than one slide per mission ending.There's a Workshop! It's kinda empty right now, but mod support is a BIIIIG thing in this it seems. It has it's own Editor, even! If you want more mods, ModDB has some that look pretty nice, including Ace Combat skins.Basically: If you don't mind some grammatical errors, kinda awkward keyboard controlls (get a damn controller), and some dialogue missing here and there, all while missing playing Ace Combat on your PS2 at 9AM while your mom tells you to go to bed, GET THIS GAME.

												This game has mixed reviews because it's not a game. It is a work of art. Honestly, the cell-shaded planes are so pretty, I almost don't want to shoot them down! The music is exquisite. The post-apocalyptic premise is thought-provoking. And best of all, the mission editor. It's a simcade, but what it lacks in realism, it makes up for in surrealism. Some say it is unfinished, I say it is an unfinished symphony...or better yet, a ballet of bullets and barrel rolls, streaking missiles and falling shrapnel, where white fluffy clouds and billowing black smoke meet. Above a war weary world.			"

The customization and mod potential here is off the charts, if you haven't gone and downloaded the voicepack mods for skimish mode you are missing out.  Editor is just icing on the cake.

												I really like this game!! I don't know why people comparing with Ace Combat, i've played ace combat:AH and i didn't like it at all...well it has ""flashy"" grapihics, but that's about it.It has a nice collection of planes (and they'll introduce more). Challenges to unlock planes are good (some of them buggy, but you can override or just pay pass points to buy the plane).Skirmish mode...i love skirmish mode, you can dogfight for hours (you make the settings about opponents/time/win conditions/type of match).You can create/edit missions in the editor... You can edit everything...even tweak the fly models a bit and armament. So i can say someone can make it more ""realistic"" ( not Realistic-realistic like DCs realistic) or even more arcade...The only bad thing so far is that the campaign lacks things here and there...and...it just needs more.Also skirmish mode needs a ground strike mode or something (because i haven't found any if it has...but still you can tweak things in edit and create  something like that).The other bad thing - if you can call it bad- is the lack of mouse aim control. So you'll either have to play with keyboard or just get a gamepad.I really like it for what it is (arcade sim?)... and i think the developers are making a good job so far.  "

												Just from looking at the trailers and game feature, you can tell the developer of this game is a huge Ace Combat fan (as is the target market for this game)Unfortunately it does not due a good job emulating the many things that series did well. Nor it is a good game overall.-Boring flying mechanicsâ¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥poor voice acting -Music is alright but the sound design is mediocre in general.-Controller support STILL broken-Combat is not engaging at all. It's a little hard to describe really, guns don't feel fun to use and missles are either completely useless or quite frankly boring to utilize.-Not immsersive at all: this is a HUGE breaker, the Ace Combat games really got you pumped up. I would feel patriotism for this fictional country I'm fighting for and even feel bad for the bogies you shot down in those games. Needless to say, Vector Thrust does not deliver that experience at all.To sum it all up:-Boring-Broken-Belongs-in-the-trash A huge dissapointment as I first followed this game on moddb, well before Steam early access was a thing.

Product received for free
												Note: As stated under the review posted date, ""Product received for free,"" I did get this game for free. I got it awhile back from the developer to play but I could never play it due to my laptop. Now that I upgraded to a decent Gaming PC, I can play it and give you my review on it. Getting the game for free doesn't affect my review at all.Like Ace Combat or HAWX? Well it's not like those games at all.The keyboard control is horrible, it feels like you are flying a tug boat in the air. You can't change the mouse sensitivity (it's really slow in the menu screen). If you pause the game in-game, you can't view your options nor look at the controls. If you change graphic settings, the whole game needs to be rebooted in order for it to take in effect. The in-game music doesn't put you in that fighter mood/style, and the jet fighters look like they are made out of cardboard.Sadly because of the horrible keyboard control, I couldn't even get past the prologue because the combat was clunky. I was trying to put out my flares so I won't get hit by a missile but I pressed every letter on the keyboard to find out it's not there. It would have been nice to pause the game to look at the controls, but that's not an option.I think the only decent thing about this game is that it's Steam Workshop availability in which you can use custom jet fighter skins. But so far, that workshop section is not very popular.-----7/18/16 edit: I literally just clicked on the game Vector Thrust in my library and I was granted 4 acheivements. I only shot down one jet fighter in the game, and I was granted a achievement for shooting down 10, 100, and 500 planes. It seems like the game is glitched.			"

								The game in its current state is missing a lot of features and there are a good amount of bugs but that's to be expected.That said, the game as it is is still a lot of fun if you enjoy an arcade-style fighter jet game. It is absolutely playable right now and it's probably the best out there today for this genre of game and looks to only get better as they finish the game. Well worth the current pirce in my opinion.Really looking forward to the final release!			"

								RELEASE REVIEW:+ Ace Combat feel with a unique cell-shaded look. Dev's dedication to the Ace Combat formula shows in spades in the game mechanics.+ Solid flight mechanics with a touch of HAWX-like departure from forward flight to exceed safe angle-of-attack limits to aim one's weapons to the side, or behind you, at cost of airframe stress damage.+ large aircraft repertoire, which includes favorites such as the F-14 Tomcat, F-22 Raptor, etc with varying statistical differences between them, from air-to-air capability, to electronics sophistication, to airframe strength, to maneuverability, etc.+ larger weapons selection between each airframe, angled to the craft's strengths. An A-10 wont be carrying advanced A2A missiles, but neither will an F-22 carry the same ground-attack payload, nor the GAU-8 Avenger cannnon.- Campaign is VERY rough, and difficulty is sorely imbalanced against you.- Sound and V/O work is also very rough, oftentimes the volume between each spoken line is VASTLY different, causing near-ear-grating transitions. Constant engine sound is also of the same poor quality, as well as the menu selection.- Odd game balancing across several aircraft and weapon systems, and a clear ""power gap"" between aircraft and weapons between early campaign aircraft forced to fight superior numbers of later aircraft, with better missiles vs weaker airframes, and the weakness of missile tracking.TL;DRFans of Ace Combat will find a solid (if extremely rough) successor to the Ace Combat formula in this game. The roughness of the campaign and V/O work however is a large deal-breaker however and as such has led me to the same recommendation I have in my Early Access Review, seen below. It is a wait-and-see. An updated review will be posted once several of the issues mentioned have had some work done on them, and I would not be surprised if my overall recommendation changes to suit.ORIGINAL EARLY ACCESS REVIEW:I wholeheartedly recommend this game for fans of Ace Combat and similar games, but not at this time, due to the unfinished and unpolished nature it is in at the moment. If and when it is in a more complete state, my recommendation will henceforth be changed posthaste, and a more complete review will follow.			"

												Few games I've played recently have filled me with as much glee as Vector Thrust.  A fast, fun, arcade style flight game inspired by the venerable 'Ace Combat' series.Good:- A staggering number of aircraft to choose from.- A wide variety of Special Weapons to employ.- Flying is very responsive and smooth.- Cel Shaded graphics are bright and colourful.- Great music that accomponies the game.- Moddable: The Game.  This extends from Skins to entirely new Aircraft and Weapons.- Easy to create your own Campaigns and Missions.- Cool Challenge system to unlock aircraft.Bad:- Some of the sounds are a bit lackluster.- Menus are a bit bland.- No cockpits.- Standard Missiles are underperforming.- A lot of the Aircraft in the families feel too similar.Overall, if you're a Fighter Jock at heart, grab this game, put your Flight Helmet on, and be off the Cat' in 3 seconds!

												Ugh. I found it IMPOSSIBLE to play this.The graphics are nice and the flight controls are fine (once set up by YOU...,The default control settings are ridiculous so need attention before you can fly, whoever set them that way was having a laugh). but what I just can`t abide is the way the HUD (or plane itself if on external view), LEAPS around the screen completely disorienting me. In cockpit mode this effect was so pronounced that my hud spent most of it`s time either on the far left of the screen or just doing the dance of the sugar plumb fairy all over the screen as I manouvered. (Theres a ""Static"" setting in the CP for the view/cam but it doesn`t seem to make any difference). If you could turn that effect off the game would be fine.But it`s a game breaker for me as I become so disoriented that I lose sight of what I`m shooting at.I bought it on offer so am not going to bother refunding, (at least I`ll get the trading cards...) But if I had paid full price (Â£19), I`d be asking for my money back.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is probably as close as we're going to get to an Ace Combat game on PC that isn't Assault Horizon. It does a really good job of capturing the aspects that make Ace Combat great with tons of planes, satisfying dogfights, and tight flight controls.  It's a lot more challenging than AC or other arcade flight sims, there is no ""enter dogfight mode"" to look at pretty explosions on rails and  win instantly like in Assault Horizon.Since it's in Early Access right now, its a little barebones in terms of content. I think only one plane has a modeled cockpit right now, and even then it is untextured.  I like how the developer tried to do the constant radio chatter thing that AC does, but the voice acting could use some serious work. The UI and map textures could use some major work as well. I think with some more polish, it could be an even better game.			"

												As of this review's authoring 3-3-2017 I cannot recommend this game for purchase.There is much potential in this, it has all the provisions for modding in new planes, new skins ans creating one's own missions and campaigns. The developers have seen lot of work to dig most obscure prototypes and developmental phases of featured airplanes. There is even a difficulty setting for ""realistic"" weapon performance, which makes missiles imitate their real-world counterparts' performance in lock-on range, turning and destructiveness.Sadly most of it is squandered at the moment with performance rife with bugs. The infamous challenges to unlock more planes outside campaign were generated by computer, resulting in numerous broken or sadistic unlocking requirements. The lone campaign Hollow Thunder offers some content with nice exposition of the game setting, but gameplay occasionally suffers from bugs.Right now I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they were hardcore Ace Combat fan and tolerant of essentially playing a beta version of the game.

												This game has potential, the graphics are there, but the game play isn't. Polish up the physics, add real cockpit views, make the physics funner/ easier for average players. Simplify the controls, who needs to switch engines? Make it easy for an Xbox controler user to pick up and have fun. Las but not least, get rid of that corny music. It's bad, I tried beating the invincible fighters in the first mission and that cloud dancing music had me seeing bears & unicors wearing bondage gear in my nightmares that night.  Honestly save your $$$ until the developers simplify the controls, and make it easier to kill targets.			"

Early Access Review
								Arcadey flight sim type game, very much like a cel-shaded Ace Combat. It doesn't have voices (yet, and I don't know if they're coming), or cockpit views, but that aside it's almost exactly like AC. It has a metric ton of aircraft, although unlocking them is a bit weird, and it's not apparent at first which modes are for what. There is a never-ending mode that drops you into a random craft doing various team dogfights with and against bots, which is more engaging than it would be just by virtue of the fact that you never know what you'll be flying next, or what you'll be flying against.Guns are well done, particularly, and dogfighting with cannons is satisfying. Taking out a 2000s era aircraft with the cannon on a 1970s MIG is a blast. They even replicate somewhat the different firing modes between the old style cannons and the new chain guns, with the chain guns taking just a slight pause to get to speed before firing.There are countermeasures, too, which are a nice addition. Some changes have been made to the world maps and they are looking much better, with the occasional city dotting the landscape, I hope the dev continues to refine this aspect of the game before release.The campaign will be immediately familiar to AC fans, as will the majority of the controls. The biggest and most obvious change is to the art style, which took me a while to warm up to, however the counter-balance to the less-realistic looks is the sheer quantity of jets you can choose to pilot; there's so many that I can't list them all here, almost every single aircraft you could name, and a lot you've never heard of as well (prototypes and so on), many with designs looking like something out of 1970s/80s Robotech anime.If you like serious flying games, this won't do anything for you, but if you ditched your console a while back and have an itch for some Ace Combat that you like to scratch now and then, check this out.

												Lots of negetive reviews for this amazing game. let's bring it down.If you're a guy who loves the story and the campaign mode, you'll be a little bit disappointed because of the bugs and the bad voice acting. If you're expecting this game to be a flight simulator, sorry but its not. Its more of a realistic arcade.But if you're a guy who are going to enjoy the game overally, this is for you. the graphics are cartoony yet amazing, the physics are good, aircrafts' aerodynamics are great but needs some improvements though. There's also a crap ton of aircrafts in here. Gamemodes such as Skirmish mode where you dogfight with A.I with your customized settings. Challenge mode to unlock further more aircraft variants in a Family format through completing fun and competitive challenges. Editor mode to create missions/campaign, and honestly I'm having a good time creating Fan-based Ace Combat missions. Along with Campaign mode and Multiplayer mode.Also to enhance your gaming experience, this game supports modifications, which you can download custom aircrafts, paint schemes, missions, improvements, and custom audio from the modding website ModDB.com, and recently, Steam Workshop.PROS:âGood GraphicsâDecent Physics and Aircraft AerodynamicsâGreat A.IâLarge Variety of Real and Fictional AircraftsâArtistic Paint SchemesâGood Selection of GamemodesâAccurate Aircraft and Weapon description/detailsâIncludes Editor modeâSupports ModdingâSupports Steam WorkshopâAwesome job for a single DeveloperCONS:âBuggy and Crashy CampaignâAwful Missile Physics (Can be revived by a mod)âBugs on some ChallengesâComplicated Editor ModâCan get bored of in a short time (Download some mods to get the hype back again).Don't forget to enable the AOA!

												Wow, I cannot believe I didn't come across this game sooner, and it surprises me even more that there are so many negative reviews (I have to assume most of them are from people who played the Early Access version). I found Vector Thrust in passing on Steam a few times but never paid much attention, especially after seeing the âMixedâ review summary. I picked it up when it went on sale just to give it a try, and I'm sorry now that I didn't get it sooner.As someone who loves the Arcade Air Combat genre, but abandoned consoles after the PS2, I've been looking for a decent PC game in this category for probably the last 10 years. There have been a few attempts (including that abomination that was the ""Ace Combat: AH"" PC port), but nothing really ever met the mark... until I found this.Vector thrust has everything you could want when it comes to arcade-style air combat: Lots of planes to choose from, lots of targets to shoot, and LOTS of ammo to shoot with. The interface is familiar to those who have played other games in the genre, and the controls are fully customizable, including support for a wide variety of controller and joystick options (though the keyboard controls are actually surprisingly good for a PC flight game too). On top of all that, the developers have gone out of their way to make the game extremely moddable, and even include an in-game editor for making custom missions. While the game does have Steam Workshop support, there is far more content available from other sites like ModDB that add to the experience of the game.Now, all that said, it isn't perfect, there are a few gripes I have with the game; I'm not a huge fan of the Cell Shading art style, though honestly I stop noticing it after the first few minutes. A few of the missions have some minor bugs, that may cause you to have to replay them occasionally, and sometimes the mission objectives are not particularly clear (like when you are told to fly to a waypoint, but then fail the mission for flying out of the area when you go a bit too far). The graphics are lackluster (especially ground textures) for a modern PC game, and whoever decided on the ""actually zero-visibility"" for the desert mission needs to be smacked (you literally cannot see anything outside the plane, at any altitude, for the entire mission, itâs REALLY boring). The dialog is long and drawn out far more than needed (especially the briefings and debriefings), and the storyline is confusing (lacking any sort of context for the events that occur, or the factions involved), uninteresting, and, as longtime fans of Ace Combat may notice, a direct copy off of the plot of Ace Combat Zero (minus back-story and plus a few twists). My final, most frustrating complaint though, is that the game has probably over 100 aircraft built-in that you can unlock for ""challenges"", but only about 10 of them appear to be actually useable in the campaign or skirmishes (unless I'm just bad and missing some trigger to unlock more after I played through the whole thing).But even with all its shortfalls, Vector Thrust has gotten me back into a genre that I haven't played in years, and I'm thoroughly enjoying playing through it. I hope the developers continue to give the game a little love where it needed, and I wish there was still a more active community (I suspect they made the mistake of over-advertising the Early Access version, and turned people off with all the, now mostly fixed, bugs), because Vector Thrust has a lot of potential, and the community content that actually IS out there is great!... I just wish I could get a few people to join my (or anyoneâs) multiplayer server every now and then.Overall, I would recommend this to anyone interested in Arcade Air Combat games, and emphatically recommend to anyone who has enjoyed other games in the genre before!

'On a image, what are you talking about'Well, between missions, the will add a image and over it, there will be a conversations.And the game crashes on that, a simple JPG image.The also crash in menu, ingame, when the game loads.It crashes alot.It says over 200 aircrafts, but literaly 100 of those are the same aircraft but with a different name. And around 60 are the same aircraft with literaly the same stats.There's some pros though, I like how the made a world, not like 'Russians vs americans' 'good americans and bad russians' we seem to get since... Since forever actualy.The made a map of the world, with different country and stuff.The campaign, is broken, the acting is average, the story line is good... I think, I only did  half of it before the game keep crashing and crashing.There's a multiplayer.It's empty.So, there's no multiplayer, what about the AI?Well, huh... They really don't like living.I did the test, 10 aces with skills level of 25(max)The will shoot missiles and stuff, but if you get close, they will stall, and crash.You start the game at 6000 meters high up, And they will just turn off they're engines and stall to death.So, this is a game where you watch people mass suiciding left and right.Vector Thrust, bringing the fun-Yea no.

												I'd really like to recomend this game. I bought it in late 2014 in Early Access because I wanted an Ace Combat style experience on PC. I liked the cel-shade look of the aircraft, and the ""arcade but not quite"" use of weapons and ammo. And I absolutely love the number of real life aircraft variants. But I couldn't play it in EA due to frequent crashes.Now the game is complete, I haven't had any issue with crashes, but I cannot deal with the game controls. Vector Thrust is controller supported, but not controller only. Switching between M+KB in the menus and controller in flight is annoying to me. And Vector Thrust HATES Steam Controllers. Maybe I'll find a set of keybinds and controller options that work,  but everytime I need to make changes, I need to return to  the main menu to do it. So. good game. just not for lazy couch casuals like me.			"

												This is a game I would recommend when it goes on sale. As a hardcore Ace Combat this game feels like the â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥â¥ child of Ace Combat trying to show it belongs to the family. The core flight mechanics are there and each plane has a unique feel handling to them but the issue comes with everything else. THe graphics are okay but you know the cell shading is hiding something the entire time and the ground textures just seem to be lazy with barely any geography at moments. The missiles in this game are horribly inaccurate and the AI seems to have better ones as they can kill you while you are pulling moves top gun would be proud of. The campaign is a bit of a let down as they only use slides and mid-mission dialogue to tell stories. Again, the game is fun and isn't bad for the price but as a spiritual successor to the king aracade flight games, it has a LONG way to go.			"

												8/10, pretty fun if you like flight games.  The cel shaded graphics are nice, and there's a huge variety of aircraft.  Take the Mig-21 for example.  Most games will have the ""Mig-21"".  This game has the Mig-21 family.  In other words, it not only includes a lot of aircraft, but it includes the different versions of each aircraft as well.  Unfortunately the game is hampered by a lot of bugs, especially in the campaign.  You can still however have a lot of fun in skirmishes and there are numerous user-made campaigns you can download.  If you've been looking for a PC alternative to the console-exclusive Ace Combat series this is a pretty good option.			"

												The game has a comic-like appearance and an aracde styled gameplay. Could have been a good game, BUT its unstable and unbalanced. Hence I give it a low rating. Within 2 hours it randomly crashed 5 times. The game could be fun and I want to like it, but the game requires a bunch of patches for the gameplay and stability.			"

												The only decent PC Ace Combat equivalent. Very arcade.But a bit rushed: very buggy. I'm willing to forgive a bit because of my ancient graphics card, but it surpasses the requirements, so...Seriously, I've never had it launch twice in a row without crashing... But sometimes all it takes is launching it again...Either way, for the price and the game you get when it works, it's pretty good.			"

												While I know this isn't finished yet, it is just super, super clunky to play.Campaign is just plain bad, sometimes missions clunk out for no reason, or don't finish. Maps just look awful, no other description for it. The method for actually unlocking planes is tedious at best, and frustrating at worst. Game modes are bad to set up correctly, with drop down lists for everything but no descriptions for what you are selecting. Things that could be improved:MenusCampaign........ needs to actually do something.Campaign needs a mission summary after the briefing since sometimes the briefing doesn't even play, and if they do, they are tedious.When picking planes in skirmish mode, a drop down image of the planes.When picking planes in skirmish mode, a drop down description of what weapons do.My biggest annoyance, the next targeting button, have an option to target the nearest enemy on the screen. It is frustrating as hell to have an enemy in front of you, and to lose them when you are switching target 10 times as it selects every plane on the map in order.Also, don't have 129 Achievements, just a mental amount to have.Maybe the game will get better as it gets closer to release, but as much as I hate to say it, just go play a horribly written Ace Combat or something, at least the game works.

Early Access Review
								Edit: 18th May 2015. As of right now, game has been the exact same when I bought it in good spirit and hopes in Desura about a year ago. More planes being added is fine and all, but the challenges are annoying as hell to complete. A XP based unlocking like IN EVERY SINGLE GAME WITH A TREE OF UNLOCKS AND ACE COMBAT 5 to be unlocked in reasonable times (very fast for 'bad' planes like F104 and Mig21s, a bit more for average planes like F-16 and MiG-29 and more than average for stuff like Su-27s, F15s, F-22s, Su30s like that) would be nice. But sadly it's not so. Also the dev really need to push for multiplayer, because atm SP campaign is easy as hell and 2short and skirmishing can sustain for only so long. Please don't buy it until release. If it ever gets to that point.			"

That's the kind of thing you'd pick up during testing, so perhaps there's no testing at all...It's a great flight game, but wait until there's a more stable version, because that's what I'm going to do.

EDIT: The sole developer has gone AWOL since around November 2016. Do not buy unless you're absolutely certain you'll be satisfied with the game as-is.Not recommended at the moment, even though it has some real potential and I'm actually having fun with it. You can consider getting it when a considerable sale is taking place (talking about 50% off or more), but getting it at full price is frankly not worth it.I'll start with the good. People familiar with Ace Combat should feel right at home... except for horribly-inaccurate missiles and guns that don't ""snap"" onto your target, but I digress. The game doesn't follow the usual ""F-4 is complete crap, F-22 is hyper-maneuverable"" pattern that most arcade flight sims seem to follow, so it's rather refreshing. Plenty of variations for many aircraft families. Some of them are interesting (e.g. FB-22 sub-family), some of them powerful (e.g. F-35X, F-15Z) and some of them downright hilarious (e.g. F-104 VTOL, Su-74) AoA limiter-off mode is a bit unrealistic, but it's plenty fun to spin your plane around like there's no tomorrow. Modding support is good and TS actually responds to modding-related requests, so I'll only expect it to get better down the road. As mentioned above, TS actually listens to user input. That is already a big plus.And the bad... Extremely CTD-happy. It would be easier listing how many ways the game does NOT crash than the other way around. It's so unstable it would be hilarious if you're not the one playing. It's not Skyrim-level of crash-happy but VT isn't that heavyweight, so it's still rather unacceptable. Lack of content. The Hollow Thunder campaign introduces you to the Battle Weary World, but doesn't actually follow up on it. It is really underwhelming, and that is already an understatement. Combined Operation and Ziz Hunt are the only included battle scenarios and you'd get tired of both quickly unless you're just using them to test your modded aircraft (which Combined Operation is actually good for). Lack of aircraft. Yes, there are plenty of variations for each family, but there aren't enough families. No Typhoon (WIP as of this review), no Rafale, no PAK FA, and not even the F-18 Hornet made it. TS being a one-man team means that updates are slow and most of them aren't really big, especially in terms of new content. I can't blame the man, but it's still a fact. The lack of official content means that you'll have to look for mods to make the game enjoyable. As it stands there isn't nearly enough either. There are planes, battle scenarios and a whole ton of Ace Combat skins, but things that stand out are far and few in between, and more often than not you'll have to make the battle scenario that you actually want to play with your own hands (which I do).

												If I could return this game, I would. But since I installed it last night and tried to play it only now, I can't so that.I tried to play this game, but it does not play well with my joystick (thrustmaster T1600). The default button mapping has pitch and yaw mixed up. Trying to re-map the controls is another exercise in frustration. One must fiddle with the dead zone before the game recognizes anything. The hat switch is not identified (it registers as axis 2); Same for the trigger and the button opposite to the trigger. The slider which would normally be used to set throttle is apparently completely invisible to Vector Thrust.I am too old to spend time trying to get this to work. When I manage to steal a few minutes a week to play a game, I expect it to work. MS Flight Sim, Jane's fighters and Tom Clancy's Hawx 1 and 2 all work with my joystick, so Vector Thrust has been a disappointment (not to mention waste of money). I'll try again in a few weeks, may be by then a patch would fix this? I wish there was a config file somewhere with the key-mappings; at least then I might be able to get this working.			"

												I rarely leave reviews but this one certainly warrants one; and not for good reason. I really wish I could recommend this because it has such great potential, but the game has way too many bugs and the controls are practically broken. The default controls are terrible for both gamepad and HOTAS, and you can't even rebind the controls because of a bug that prevents you from doing so. This was released from early access way too soon and the developer is slow to act and slow to respond to players. This game would be great if it wasn't so buggy. I recommend avoiding this for now, but maybe keep an eye on it and see if the developer updates and patches the game in time.			"

												I don't know why  so many people are complaining about this game and giving it bad reviews.  It's actually pretty slick.  It's not a game you're going to jump right into and shoot down everybody.  You have to actually outmanuever the enemy and line them up to get a good shot, which takes a bit of practice.  Plus you have to worry about missiles coming at you and back up your wingmen.  Overall, it's a good experience.  At least it was for me anyway.  Plus if they're adding on to it, it should get even better.  So here's the verdict from me...Don't get it if you want an easy game where you can just fly up to an aircraft and shoot it down.Get it if you like to take on opponents tactically and blow them into bits.   I mean, you can take out multiple aircraft in seconds, or spend 5 minutes (or more) chasing down one fighter while trying to dodge incoming missiles.			"

												First off, there's no tutorial or anyway in game to check controls. So you better read up before you start a mission. Second, I can't beat Mission 1. I doubt it's skill related, after you destroy the first batch of enemies, you get a small cutscene, after which you get a new objective: ""Stay close to blue hammer"" 3 seconds later: Mission failed. No reason why, I'm closer to blue hammer after 3 seconds than before. Just Mission failed. same thing happend second time I tried it, I have no time to do anything that should end in mission fail. On a positive note, I did like the cel shaded youch the game has, It's looks really nice. That's about the positives the game offered... 3.5/10Edit: I almost forgot, in my first mission, where I killed 3-4 enemies. When the mission failed, I got the 1, 10, 100 and 500 kills without being detected achievements... so there's that. Still 3.5/10			"

The Ai cheats, the maps are lifeless and boring, the controls are not the smoothest, the story & voice actors are boring, and the music is bland.The only thing I liked about the game was the design of all the jets and the amount of aircrafts they said are in the game. This game should have never left EA yet, but if they fix theses issues and add a workshop for mods I think it will be a success.ããã¼ãç§ã¯å·¨å¤§ãªã¨ã¼ã¹ã³ã³ããããã¡ã³ï¼1-5ãPSPã®ãã¼ã¸ã§ã³ï¼ã¨è¸æ°ã®äº¤æµãã¬ãã¼ã¸ã§ããã©ããã®ã²ã¼ã ã¯ãã£ã¦ããäº¤æµã®PSPçã«è¿ãæ¥ã¦ããªãã¨ãããã¨ã§ããã®ã²ã¼ã ãæãããã£ãã§ããæã®ç©èªï¼ãã¤ã¹ã¢ã¯ã¿ã¼ãéå±ãã¦ããããããã¯ã³ã³ãã­ã¼ã«ãã¹ã ã¼ãºã§ã¯ãªããæ­»ãã§éå±ãã¦ãããè©æ¬ºãé³æ¥½ã¯å½ããéãã®ãªãã§ããç§ã¯ã²ã¼ã ã«ã¤ãã¦æ°ã«å¥ã£å¯ä¸ã®ãã®ã¯ããã¹ã¦ã®ã¸ã§ããã®è¨­è¨ãå½¼ãã¯ã²ã¼ã ã§ããã¨è¿°ã¹ãèªç©ºæ©ã®éã§ããããã®ã²ã¼ã ã¯ã¾ã EAãæ®ãããã¨ã¯ãªãã¯ãã§ãããå½¼ãã¯è«æã®åé¡ãä¿®æ­£ããæ¹é ã®ããã®ã¯ã¼ã¯ã·ã§ãããè¿½å ããå ´åãç§ã¯ãããæåã«ãªãã¨æãã¾ãã			"

												I wanted to love this game.  Really, I did.  As an avid fan of the second gen Ace Combat games (4, 5, Zero, and then 6 on XB360), this looked like it would fill the void left after my PS2 and XB360 went off to meet the great HDTV in the sky.Unfortunately, I couldn't play the game.  Despite numerous troubleshooting steps posted in the forums, including reverting back to an older version the dev had uploaded as a beta branch, the game just would not start for me.  As it turns out, the crashes on startup were directly related to my controller being connected to my PC.  It was an NVidia Shield controller which requires no special drivers and should function as a standard Xbox controller.I did what any good gamer would do; made a few posts on the forums in the relevant topics, uploaded the requested logs and system specs, and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  I heard nothing.I realize that TimeSymmetry is just a one-man outfit (or close to it), and there are rumors swirling around the forums about Iceburg forcing him to release from EA early, and that he's released some patches since official release, so it was with a heavy heart that after 1.5 weeks and under 20 minutes played, I submitted a refund request from Steam.I wanted to love Vector Thrust, and I will check back from time to time, but in its present state I can't in good conscience recommend it.

												Playing Vector Thrust is like going to work covered in bruises and stating that ""I just fell down the stairs"" or ""he still loves me.""You're just lying to yourself as you're too afraid to face reality.I've seen the wheelchair bound perfom more graceful feats. Actually, have you seen some of those sort of extreme wheelchair types? No joke, they're pretty rad. More power to them for overcoming, seriously. I could never hope to do that kinda of stuff and I'm able bodied. Those guys and gals are pretty rad.Oh, and you have to admit, Iceberg Games is a pretty apt name.			"

It's way too buggy and broken to be considered anywhere near playable let alone complete.

												Vector Thrust is freaking awesome! So now I have your attention, the game has a wicked cel-shaded graphics style there is tons of weapons and loads of jets/planes you can jump into and take for a spin on multiple levels. The levels are huge coupled with fast and frantic dog fights along with trying to hit ground battles avoid missles and everything else its insane! Game looks amazing, plays exceptionally and has alot to give!

								If you own a sound card, you don't want this game in any state. Avoid this game like the plague. There are high chances it won't even start. I bought this game in alpha state in August only to found that it didn't work. ""Maybe is a temporal problem, surely the developers will care for their supporters and fix this EVIDENT AND INSULTING problem with sound devices."" 6 Months later and the developers have the nerve to claim a useless amount of space in my HD a ""Beta State"" and the problem is still there. I'm thinking that there is no real intention to fix it. I have bought and played other Early Access games, and with experience I can tell for sure: This is the Worst Early Access game ever and doesn't deserve any kind of support, ever.EDIT after 2 years: After being supposedly out of Early Access, I still have to cross fingers everytime I try to start the game and try to fix the game so I can play it.

								I really wanted to like this game as I think that there needs to be more flight sims / arcade on Steam, that being said I did not find much to enjoy in this Early Access release. I think the cel shading is ugly and does not add anything to the already lacking visuals. The envirnoments are flat and uninteresting, mostly consisting of sparce flat billboard trees and a gradient horizon to indicate if you're facing up or not. The missions are exceedingly basic and monotonous, usually consisting of flying over large expanses of empty space, only to engage in a overly simple task, or a incredibly imbalanced difficult one. In the case of the latter, your ship will immediately disintigrate and you'll be forced to make the trek over the map once again. The game UI is hideous and would have looked out of place in a Top Gun movie. While the ships look like someone traced diagram schematics and put them into the game as is. This game is costs a premium price but does not deliver a premium experience. Early Access or not, there are no elements in the design of this game that would make me feel at any stage that I got my moneys worth.			"

								Can't even get it to launch because of the audio device bug everyone seems to be getting. Spend your $14 elsewhere until it's fixed. I recommend finding a copy of Strike Fighters 2 and its expansions. Tons of customization in that game. Or, you could just boot up your PS2 and rock out on some actual Ace Combat. I'll miss my tree fiddy + 10. Hopefully the bug gets fixed soon so I can actually play the game, but the first impression is one of frustration and disappointment.Bug Fix Update: I was finally able to launch the game after having to go into the game files and edit some things. The art style is quite lovely, but right now it's the game's only redeeming feature. The ""challenges"" to unlock new planes are a joke, the campaign is at the moment merely a collection of stand-in missions and there are still some bugs, weapons performance and balancing issues to work out.There is potential. But right now it feels like a cheaply made Ace Combat knock off. Wait until the full release.			"

								If you're a fan of games like Ace Combat, HAWX, or even some of Airforce Delta games, then Vector Thrust might be what you're looking for. I say might because of several glaring issues with the beta version of the game as it currently stands (12 April, 2015). I early accessed this game well over a year ago after spotting it on moddb. At the time I had just shedded off my last console, and was no longer able to play one of my favorite arcade flight sims Ace Combat 6. Becase Vector Thrust obviously targets those who love arcade flight sims in the vein of Ace Combat, it's worth noting that Timesymmetry's current offering meets some-but-not-all of the benchmarks set by the franchise's 10+ years of success.Vector Thrust definitely strikes the ""Strange but real"" tone set by the AC fanchise by constructing a fictional world where global superpowers fight geopolitical battles not with large land armies or diplomacy but with hyper-powerful air forces. That impression is essential to a game like this because it sets the stage for moment you the player realize your own heroism in the heat of battle. It's all riding on you the ace pilot, and Timesymmetry has definitely set their sights on keeping with that tradition througout the game's story missions. Fans of the genre will probably drool when they read the developer's roadmap for all of the playable aircraft to eventually be added. If you're unsatisfied with it currently you can always download custom planes and drop them right in the game's directory--it's standard for PC games but it is refreshing to see an arcade flight sim clearly decendent from a console gaming tradition embracing this powerful and compelling feature. The gameplay is getting better with every update it seems. Enemy fighters are hard to shoot down as they should be, but you very seldom feel cheated out of a missile shot once you get a handle on the game's lock-on and fire mechanic. With Ace Combat most of the aircraft were fairly even in terms of weapon range and damage, and the advantage was conferred more on the player that could more skillfully weave their fighter in and out of a hairball using guns and missiles. That principle applies here but more in accordance with aircraft performance stats and weapon load outs. Timesymmetry has made sure that newer aircraft outperform older ones in more respects than just maneuverability and speed. It makes for a fun skirmish when you span 15 enemy MiG-21s and an F-15 J Kai+ for yourself, sometimes the results might surprise you. Challenges need work, and feel very asymmetric in terms of difficulty and time required to complete many of the objectives. It's a matter of balancing primarily, and the farther along TS gets in development, as well as the more player feedback they get, the more refined the gameplay modes will become (hopefully). The game desperately needs work in the controls. I've played it with an Xbox controller and it plays fine, not too  unlike it's relatives in the genre. However the lack of smoothed mouse-aiming is a huge turn off to many players, and is something that I think the devs should focus a great deal of time perfecting. It's a PC game after all, so ensuring that you can just as easily boot up and play with a KB/M combo as you can with a controller is an essential feature. Currently, the game lets you map pitch and turn to the mouse, but it's sluggish, inconsistent, and not helpful wheny you're trying to dogfight. Your mouse is essentially locked to the plane, as the camera would be to the head of the player in an FPS, this not ideal though. What they should implement is a control scheme using the mouse that borrows from War Thunder, where you can aim freely in front of the aircraft, and the plane responds based on where you place your mouse pointer, not based on how your mouse movement corresponds to the control surface movement (if that makes sense?). \I think adding some features like this will help distinguish it against the background of its parent genre. Vector Thrust is an Ace Combat clone with some cool unique features added into the formula. It could easily take on an identity of its own if the controls are more friendly to casual playing, and once the campaigns are finished and playable. I'm eager to see where this game goes.			"

Still needs some polish (obviously) and some stat balancing (like the F-22A have the same stealth rating as ye Olde Jaguar) but all an all, it's worth your time!Update: Post release, I cannot reccomend this game in its broken state. Dialog is cut-off, missions fail for no apparent reason, pacing is poor, campaign aircraft don't have sp weapons etc. It looks like the team fell victim to feature creep. Game still has potential, but hold off on buying unless some serious updating occurs.			"

								Put simply, this is the best arcade combat flight game around... And we aren't even out of Beta. There is plenty of different aircraft to choose. While there isn't too many single player missions around, you can set up your own skirmishes. Missions are Air to air, air to ground/naval or a combination or both, so even if its imcomplete, there is still many hours of enjoyment. The cell shaded animation is pure bliss to look at, very simple & striking. Sounds do seem to be generic & only the F-16 has a basic cockpit configuration. This is definitely going to get better as time goes on. It plays very smoothly & its very energetic. Plus, the amount of times the wife has told me to stop playing proves that this will continue to be a part of my life for many moons to come			"

								Early Access low playtime review:May Change in the futureSo far so good, i was hoping for something like Ace Combat X and Joint Assault for the PSP... and i think i found it!This game is heavily relying on similar mechanics and that is AWESOME!Rocket gameplay is insanely addicting and when you get better at it its a rewarding way to play modern era jets. You don't simply fire and forget you have to plan if the rocket will be able to track the target and will be able to hit. Same goes for defensive play! You can use Flares and Chaff but mostly you can rely on the maneuverability of your aircraft to evade rockets. The AI is surprisingly good at evading a few shots and they can be tuned up to be more difficult in skirmish mode.Unlocking System: Interesting challenge based system where you have to fulfill different requirements during challenges to unlock other variations of the same aircraft and with time you get new ones. Its fun and can provide plenty of challenge for those who want to test themselves and of course want to unlock more planes.The Campaign is so far not bad but no voice actors as of now i guess thats something for the future.Soundeffects are okay... from videos and stuff i was expecting worse but to be honest it kinda sounds cool when you evade a rocket and you can hear it fly behind your plane, the beeps and boops are easily recognisable and learnable so you will know what to do when a warning sound goes off pretty soon.Graphics are not the best you seen in recent games but it holds its place and does not take away anything from your gameplay experience. Bugs: So far i encountered a few CTD bugs but all of them were in menu's  so so far no gamebreaking ones except for the SU 37 challenge where it wont load up the map due to some issue ( i still did not read after it so not sure if its easy to fix or will have to wait an update)TLDNR: Its a good replacer for those who want something similar to Ace Combat on the PC without the flashy zoom on the gun and helicopter gunner sequences that Assault Horizon has.i hope the devs can keep it up with their hard work and we once see a nice game release from this potential awesomeness :)			"

Early Access Review
								The first game I have to sit tight and play.So much potential and can't end in making missions in editor.No way to play this game without mods,the mods are the really best part of this game,and that also make me and my friends start to make mods by ourselves!You would found a lot in VT,it's not just a AC kind game but a playground and you're the one who decided how to play it.

												Imagine if Ace Combat were an indy game. Yep thats pretty much what this is. Last time I played the UI in the menus was a little unclear but other than that it doesn't do anything more or less than the Ace Combat games I've played (other than the things that you can forgive an indy game for). Still better than the only Ace Combat game on Steam! Also, a controller isn't required but VERY reccomended!			"

												First off, this should still be in early access for sure. Content is missing and there's several bugs but nothing more than you'd expect from early games. Don't rush in to it expecting a full finished game. With that being said the game is being updated and is continually improving. From what I see, the developer is taking notes and listening to player feedback.Secondly, forget everything about other flight games/simulators before playing this. Still images are used during cutscenes similar to older Ace Combat games but that's where comparisons should end. Everything is a mix of arcade and realism which I like but most other people seem to hate. Its arcadey with stable flying and a payload of about 50 missiles per mission but you're able to do things like turn off the AoA limiter to do post-stall maneuvers while launching chaff and flares to dodge a missile at the last second.Its a unique game and it is a game I'm enjoying. The underlying game is brilliant, just needs more content and polishing. Looking forward to further updates!EDIT: There are more similarities between this and AC series. The world is similar to Strangereal and ace squadrons have introductions among other things but it's not a clone.			"

												Wow.. this is somthing us aviation nuts have been begging for. It mixes the Gameplay of ace combat, with an open source easy to edit system like in the Janes Fighters anthology series. realistic enough to give some good vareity, but easy enough to pick up and play without having to look through a manual. Still needs some polish (obviously) and some stat balancing (like the F-22A have the same stealth rating as ye Olde Jaguar) but all an all, it's worth your time!Update: Post release, I cannot reccomend this game in its broken state. Dialog is cut-off, missions fail for no apparent reason, pacing is poor, campaign aircraft don't have sp weapons etc. It looks like the team fell victim to feature creep. Game still has potential, but hold off on buying unless some serious updating occurs.			"

												very good successor to air combat. Doesn't need a lot of graphical power. Waiting on a gtx 960 to arrrive and currently using a intel hd 4600 on a core i7 4790k. Can turn the graphics up to the highest custom settings and it's smooth as butter on a igpu based video card. I am glad that iceberg interactive picks out good indie devs to publish for. Iceberg are also the guys who publish for gamepires, the guys who make the very awesome gas guzzlers extreme. BTW, use a xb360 game pad with this as the manual shows all of the buttons allocated to that game controller. I find it easier to play with a xb360 controller than a thrustmaster usb joystick.			"

												Purchased this day one early access, and am appauled that this game is out of early access in such a bad state! There are so many issues and things that the dev's have said that they where working on many many many months ago that have yet to be patched in. The game features virtual cockpits, but the only one that shows up currently is the F-16's with no textures, there was also suppose to be better animations with the aircraft including thrust nozzle movement. We have yet to have those included/ fixed. Also As the game the game progressed it became more and more rediculous with hit detection/ weapon stregnths/ missle accuracy/ gun accuracy. It only takes 2 - 3 bullets to shoot your plane down, but millions to down an enemy, to add, you can line up your gun piper with the leading target sight and miss due to the accuracy of your gun, it's almost as iff the gun piper is not centered to the gun. Now for the missles..... the most inaccurate thing in the game. The enemy doesn't even need to turn or drop countermeasures the missle just lose track for no reason and fly off in another direction. Enemy bombers take about 10 - 14 missles to shoot down, which in the second mission you have 12 of them to down and only 40 missles, mind you, bombers have turrets and 2 bullets to your plane equals sht down so don't even try guns.  With honesty, this is a huge let down because of the lazy dev team, it could have been a proper ace combat like game for the PC platform. Do not by this game, and those who have, I suggest we all ask for a refund, we did not get what was promised by the devs.			"

												So, full release happens, already some time passed,  what do we have? Nothing.Potential Ace combat clone got wasted.The game has a good hand, it is not entirely bad. It has a good part.1) Gameplay. The game is really played as Ace Combat.2) Good game soundtrack that during the game gives you the right attitude.3) Graphics (Technically) looks pretty good.But unfortunately, it only enhances anger, because in the case come the negative aspects.1) Game play. Balance is really strange, your plane is cardoard, that can be shot down with 2 rockets or a few bullet, while some enemies can hold ALOT of damage. Like bomber on 2nd missions, hell they takin too much rockets, and ammo is not infinite. Some ground forces are too tough. This is not a simulator, Ace combat always was action in air, and this game is same, but why the hell incrase difficulty with limited ammo and cardboard. Hell, better planes have better armor, they can hold 3 ROCKETS! WOOHOO!. And what is the purpose of adding functions to start\stop engine!? Only to add unneeded realism!? Its absolutely  useles, i can't even find button on gamepad where to put that stupid function.2) Singleplayer. Ohhh this is worst part of a game. Its boring, its empty, badly informative and booring briefings, no cutscenes on missions, no cutscenes between missions (NO! A SINGLE STATIC PICTURE with absolutely not emotional dialog can't be called a cutscene!). I expected that cutscenes between missions will be comic like, its a best choise for an indie developer, BUT NOT A SINGLE STATIC PICKTURE! You can't skip dialogs, on missions before start fighting, and after loosing on mission, you need to listen everything again. Game does not even try to somehow inspire Player. Devs said its only first campaighn..............................IN FULL RELEASE VERSION! Why then made a full release if game is not ready at all!? Publisher pushed! I DON'T CARE!3) Bugs. I need to replay part of campaighn, because release version has a bug that won't allow to buy new planes in singleplayer! Button remaping, spetially on gamepad is workin horribly, it allows me to remap 3 buttons, then games goes crazy and won't allow me to change others buttons until i restart the game. Multiplayer is laggy(Expectable), and drops you to main menu alot(Expectable but ACCEPTABLE).4) Challenges\Mods. On EA game quckly has focused on modifications and challenges. While promised interesting singleplayer campaighn(Wich we don't have, like only 1 of 4). And i don't care about omds at all, i can just pass them without paying attention, but challenges. I HATE CHALLENGES, not only in that game, but if many games challenges only addition you can pass, VT force you to complete them to unlock new planes for multiplayer! YES! You can buy planes on point that you earn in multiplayer matches, but its extremely much slower than wasting time on boring challenges. Hell they even made an enemy squad introdusing cutscene...........IN A CHALLENGE!! WHILE CAMPAIGHN DON'T HAVE IT!! SERIOUSLY!5) Graphics (Design). Its simply emtpy. Almos flat map, with almost 0 objects. No cities, no trees, no rocks. You will never remember a single location in this game. Yes, landscape mostly a decoration, but its freakin must be!! You feel flying nowhere and it brings boredom. Too bad, didn't wanted to happen with this game. Not many AC clones exist, like old game as RaidersSphere4th, wich is also clone of AC, and that game have a better design and storytelling(Unfortunatly much more buggy). This game is lost, even if devs add campaighns, even they fix bug, im sure they won't redesighn maps and made much better cutscenes. Game just boring, i feel sorry for game that actualy have huge potential and maybe even soul, cause it feel like devs made work with...............love!? But all this work wasted. RIP. And maybe ill someday play a new Ace combat, H.A.W.X. or another indie clone, wich will be finally good.			"

												First and foremost this game was rushed out of early development by the publisher and not the developer. Secondly the developer, TimeSymmetry, is a one man team who has been working on this game for 5 years now. I understand the frustrations that many have with the game but I have hope that the dev will fix these problems, I would say if it's on sale to buy it so the dev knows there's still some intrest in this project.

												OK after 3 hours of game time, here is an assesment for you. Is the game worht it? probably. Your mileage might vary but it depends on a few things. As follows my list of cons and prosPros: Nice aestheticsGame play is very similar to the Ace Combat Games (in fact it's the closest to them I've found so far) Large variety of planes to fly Nice set of challenges to unlock more contentCons:Terrible voice acting (seriously you can tell they are reading of a script)Bugs lots of them, especially game breaking ones like the OpenAL problem with wrap_oal.dll. The Game engine panics in  and causes problems executing OpenAL. Did I mention game breaking bugs? Sometimes the controls feel unresponsive or slow ( using a gamepad ) I would recommend this game on a sale but not full-price, it's honestly a bad business for a consumer to buy this expecting a fully working game and find that sometimes it just will not work.

												Alot of mixed reviews here but here's my take....I buy an Early Access game on Steam expecting there to be bugs / stability issues, which this has it's fair share of at the moment (v1.400 3rd April 2016), and there is clearly alot of work still to go in terms of fleshing out the campaign and the economics of buying fighters as you progress. BUT. I accepted happily when I paid 6.74 GBP that this would be the case.Surely the reason that early access games have become such a success on Steam is that it provides the developers with the incentive to finish the game properly, act on feedback they recieve and ultimately, have a surge of community support when the title is ready for a full release. This should be one of those games. The graphics engine and UI remind me of XIII in terms of style, whereas the features that the game offers are VERY similar to the Ace Combat series. I've been waiting for this style of arcade flight sim, and I like the way this game is going!Sure - it's crashing alot. But I keep playing it and getting hooked on each mission, and I think many, many others will to. Once the stability issues are ironed out, I'll consider the small investment I made purchasing this to be an absolute bargain.			"

												TL;DR: Fun game, way too buggy, crashes a lot. Needs major technical work, but has potential. Fun game, when it works. Still has some major technical issues, along with some campaign bugs(I'll get more into that in a moment) Loaded up first mission and beat it first time through, or so I thought. Killed all enemy contacts, and flew to the edge of the airspace (as commanded by the NPCs). Then lost the mission due to going out of bounds. Load up, try again, this time let the jet that we're escorting go infront of me, seems to fix it, and clear the mission. This seems like a little annoyance but wait there's more. Working on playing through this one mission in a sandstorm and bombing an enemy attack force. No big deal, fairly easy mission all things considered, except for when you actually try to fly over the main force the game crashes. Almost every time. The game already crashed fairly frequently, but that mission in particular turned into try to bomb these things from as far away as possible  and break away before the number of entities being loaded (I speculate) causes the game to crash and you need to start over again. And incase that hasn't conviced you of the game's bugginess, last mission alright? Have to assault this base and eventually the prince flies out and you have to shoot him down. Fine, decent enough story reason and fun mission to play. So he flies out, I start dogfighting him and winning to a certain extent. Wonderful right? Right. Then the AI for the prince decides to not pull up in time, and he hits the side of a mountain. Okay whatever. Mission doesn't end so I clean up the airspace and destroy all known targets. Badda boom badda bang, map's clear of any hostile contacts.... oookay, mission never ends and have to restart. Turns out that to actually beat the mission you need to shoot down the prince by wittling down his health through several diolague triggers untill eventually he's going down and shoots himself in the cockpit.
