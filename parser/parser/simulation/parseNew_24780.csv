												Doesn't require a constant internet connectionDoesn't randomly wipe citiesDoesn't prevent you from using modsDoesn't restrict control over regionsDoesn't confine you to a 10x10 city gridIt does however put a game that is 10 years newer to shame. If you want SimCity, look no further.			"

												I played this game a lot when i was 12 or 13 or whatever which explains why i didn't have a girlfriend for a long time but I played it recently and it's still a hell of a lot of fun. I built a city with two motorways going out of the city but also a toll road and then a subway system and this gave me a hell of a lot of money and so i spent it on health and education and i felt really good about myself for 5 or 10 minutes. i still don't have a girlfriend though			"

												If modded this game even though its ten years old, in my opinion its much better than the new version. I bought this one again after finding out how bad the new one was. You should mod this game for sure though, with larger regions, the NAM and CAM and whatever else you want on the great modding sites for this game. Currently im playing on a very detailed  sat. map of the US with over 500 of the largest city tiles in one single region. Just one of my city tiles from what i heard is four times bigger than a city tile on the new version and i have over 500 of them, all are connected to and interact with each other. Building the entire country with things so spread out leaves tons of open land adding to the realism that the region system in this game creates.  HANDS DOWN THE BEST CITY SIM IN THE WORLD AND THIS GAME IS OVER 10 YEARS OLD!!!!!     C,MON EA??? WHAT HAPPENED?!?!Here are some videos showing my current region :) Its much higher quality on youtube itself though

												THE city simulator. It's old but it's the best one out there if you ask me. Even though the graphics aren't full 3D they are still surprisingly high definition and it is fun to zoom in close just to look at the buildings. The graphics really do still hold up. I was honestly surprised.The gameplay is fantastic if you're into this genre although there are a few problems. Some of those can be fixed with mods, which there are plenty of. There's nothing that would ruin the experience, just some nit-picky things that would make a couple of things easier in the long run. The modding community is great and popular mods are totally worth getting even if some of them change the game mechanics quite a bit. If you new to the genre I would recommend you first play a city or two without mods to get the vanilla experience. For the fans of the genre: mod to your hearts content. You can pull a lot of extra depth out of the game with the right mods.Depending on how you play once you reach that final stage with your city where everything runs like a finely oiled machine it might feel like you've reached the end. Some may continue to micromanage every little aspect for days to come but I recommend starting a new city. I personally prefer going for a visually impressive city rather than the most efficient one. Sim City becomes more of an information management/puzzle game if you aim for the most productive city. It is more enjoyable to create something visually pleasing.You will waste days managing your city once you get sucked in. Prepare your calendar accordingly. This among my favorite games of all time.(I have probably played SimCity a hundred hours back in the day. I still have the disc!)----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----Story: -/5 (There isn't one.)Gameplay: 5/5Challenge: 3.5/5 (Depends on individual styles of play.)Discovery: 1.5/5Replayability: 5/5Aesthetics: 4/5Visuals: 4/5Atmosphere: 2/5Music: 5/5			"

												While you cannot build crazy windy roads, SimCity 4 is perfect for building a city with grid street plan and you'll get everything you didn't get in SimCity 2013: huge maps, multiple entrances, zoning lots, detailed statistics/graphs/budgets, multiple transportation options from subway, elevated train, freeway, toll gates... the list goes on.SimCity 4 is rather old game so bear in mind that the software is not optimized for computers with multiple CPU cores/threads (will only take up one core instead of x cores you have on your system).

												Looking for City Building Fun? Look no further!Pros - Not Sim City 2013- Looks very good for a game from 2004- Gritty, Realistic, Approach to City Design - Large Selection of Terrains- Easily Adjustable Settings- Amazing Soundtrack- Modding Kit makes for a longer gameCons - Terrible System Optimization for Newer PCs- Borderline Broken Demands on Easy and Medium Difficulties without ModsI have been playing this game for years, picked it up on Steam last Summer. I have to say, the biggest issue I have with it now is Optimization on my PC. You cannot run the game past 1600x1080 without massive screen tearing and Region View Issues and Terrain Glitches (Purely Cosmetic.) Overall I would say the only other noticable issue, after 10 years (10 year old game better than a game made in 2013, who the ♥♥♥♥ knew?!) is the broken system demands on Easy and Medium. Both difficulties will eventually go in complete negative demand, with no possible way to recover, unless you install mods, which leads to my next point. Even after all these years the modding community is still huge, so much effort goes into so many mods. Honestly I see no reason not to buy this game.9/10 - Great game if you like City Planning and Building games.			"

												So, you bought into SimCity 5 as a young person wondering why everybody was so excited. Played it for a few hours, days maybe and wondered if those that were excited were completely nuts. I can't blame you if you are described in the above statement. I hate SimCity 5, the terrible Origin thing, the dreadful online experience, the stupid limitations to what you can and can't do. But if you use SimCity 5 as an excuse for not getting your hands on this classic, than you are destined to fail in life. Heed my warning, spend some cash on this, particularly if it is on offer. You will not regret it.			"

												First off I will say that my hour count is not correct, I played this for hundreds more hours on the disc version of the game. I caved in for the Steam version so I don't need my optical drive installed.This game is my all time favorite game, nothing has come close to beating it. This game released more than 10 years ago still holds up very well thanks to the modders and the community of this game. If you don't like something about the game then search Simtropolis for a mod to fix it. As a beginner the modding might seem a bit scary. Tons of dependencies! What do I do?!? I started by installing the mods slowly. First the NAM mod which is essential, then other things such as added trees, buildings, etc. You don't need to install every mod at once to have fun in this game. Just be sure you install all the dependencies to the mods your installing, or else you'll get dreaded brown boxes all over your city (no fun!).If you need to compare this to modern city builders such as Cities Skylines or Simcity 5 I still think that it beats it. Maybe it's just because I have a great nostalgia about this game. Cities Skylines is an excellent successor to this, but it just can't replace this game in my heart. Compared to Simcity 5, this game is amazing. Bigger cities, doesn't need Origin, and no major ""Agent"" problems. Whether you want to build an uber realistic city or just a casual city this game is definitely for you. It goes on sale for $5 during the sales, so if you can wait then I would recommend it. If you want a 3D city builder with easy to install mods Cities Skylines is probably for you. Also, before running this game check out the guides on Steam on how to run this on modern hardware. My system only needed some tweaks, but yours might need more. My system specs: AMD FX 6300, 8gb DDR3 RAM, AMD Radeon HD 7870, MSI 970a-g43 AM3+ motherboard.Get ready to waste hours of your life creating the perfect interchange!Update: Since this review I've upgraded my PC to a i5 4690k, 24gb DDR3 RAM, MSI Gaming 6G GTX 980ti, and MSI Gaming 5 motherboard plus Windows 10 and the game still works great.

												I spent years playing this game for PC. The CD is still in my laptop right now. For those that don't know, SimCity is the originator of being a mayor, placing down your roads, zoning area for buildings, watching them grow and balancing the budget. This isn't for everyone, but to a lot of us, this is huge fun and SimCity 4 is probably the best in the series.This is all single player, instead of the more current SimCity 2013 that is focused on multi-player. The game can cycle from night to day, but its just a look and doesn't seem to do anything special. You have terrain control like previous versions of SimCity before you start each game.You start out in a region map of dozens of land plots. Large, medium and small. You pick a plot of land and make your city. You can then save that city, load the region and start up a new city on a different plot of land or go to a previous city. Why does this matter? Because you can trade between cities, you can export and import water, garbage, energy and so on. Not just that, but the sims / citizens can travel back and forth. Such as living in one town and going to another for work. You'll also have pollution effects that seep into other towns as well. This is all single player, so you need to jump between cities. Because two or more towns can thrive off of one another, you can put your heavy polluting industries in an extremely profitable town on their own with no residents living there to complain about how awful it is. There is no need for police, hospitals or schools if no one is living in your industrial city. Then just make some mass transit system for them to get to and from work.When you play, you have full control from the start with only a few things locked away unlike Cities XL that requires your city to grow before it unlocks things for you. Because you have full control, that may set you up for failure quickly. Highways, big hospitals, deluxe police stations and so on cost big money and until your city is big, you should keep it small. Once your city grows, the game has ways to tell you that your hospital is too small, such as your staff workers will go on strike. How do you know if its too small? Sadly you can't just hold shift and click the building, you need to click the ? and then the building. It seems tedious, but you'll see what the building can handle and adjust its budget. If you can't adjust the budget high enough, its time to make a bigger version of the building or just plop down another building to do the same thing.You need to keep your budget balanced, everything will cost monthly money, so you either need to cut spending from places like roads, schools, utilities or raise taxes, which might make some businesses, commerce and residents run to away from your city. When you lower taxes, of course people move in, but then your hospitals, schools and so on will be overcrowded, your buildings will grow larger. Its beautiful.The game will tell you what kind of zones you'll need, such as low, medium and high density residential, commercial, industry and even agricultural. Its your job to plop them down. It has a graph to show you if you need more and less. If you need less, raise taxes for them, or replace the zone with a new zone. Luckily the game makes it easy to replace zones.There are all sorts of charts and maps, such as pollution, both water and air. Crime, fire safety, land value and so on. If you want to raise land value, put down police, fire, schools and so on. Then add parks and various things to drive value up. Replace dirty industries that pollute with cleaner industries like medium density manufacturing.You can also click on zoned buildings to see the crime, water, power, pollutants, and even the driving pattern of where the residents go and where the employees come from. Its a very nice feature. Especially if you're trying to reduce traffic. You have control over roads, avenues, streets, highways, trains, subways, busses and so on. Its fun to see just how far people will ride a bus to work. The game has plenty of charts too, in order to demonstrate how far the average drive is, how much garbage you have, the age and education of your population. Its all a lot of information.On top of that, you have advisers that will tell you what's good and bad about your city. The game sadly uses pop up windows to tell you what's up, but thankfully there is a setting to turn it off, or else before you know it, you'll have nothing but popups. Instead you can look at the ticker at the bottom of the screen and even go into the advisers section to see their specific needs.After all is said and done, you can then summon a natural disaster (or truckasaurus) to come and destroy your town. Why you'd want to? Just for the laughs I guess. Because this is the deluxe edition, it comes with Rush Hour expansion pack, which gives you the ability to take over vehicles and drive them on the road. Not first person, but still from the normal almost top down perspective. This content gives you missions that will give you cash and other rewards, but really, it doesn't feel like a great addition. Its just there.This game is a classic, but after 10+ years, I don't think that its aged very well. After months of playing Tropico and Cities XL, those games just seem to run smoother control wise and have explanation to them. Having a hot key for pause would have been nice. Fires break out in your town extremely frequently, no matter how good your fire coverage is. It just breaks the flow of the game, you need to send your fire fighters out to stop the fire and wait while they put it out. That's just not fun.There are also a few minor bugs, but some that will crash the game. Since there is no autosave, you can lose an hour's worth of progress if not an entire city.It is still an enjoyable game and I can recommend it more than SimCity 2013. Is it worth the $10 - $20? No and yes. If you enjoy mayoring sims, you can sink days and months into this game, then its worth it, but you should wait for a $5 sale if not cheaper.			"

												Since I won't touch SimCity 2013 (and Origin in general) due to all the problems and irritants those bring to the table, SimCity 4 is the most recent choice of SimCity games that I can really play. It is dated and has some issues such as lack of widescreen support and the other usual issues older games have with newer OS's, but that can be fixed. And despite that, from what I have heard, this game is still better than the recent remake even without all those online issues that game had, with more features and larger maps to build cities on. Also this game has a strong modding community (Simtropolis) with an insane amount of new buildings and stuff to add to your game. Ideally you want a good PC if you plan on making super-big cities and don't want your game to lag like crazy, but even my poo PC can more or less handle this fine despite having built cities more densely populated than any currently existing on Earth.So if you feel the sudden urge to build cities, and yet realize that so many city building games of the past few years have a host of glaring issues, then SimCity 4 is your best choice. Have fun! :D			"

												I've spent probably thousands of hours on this game before I even had a Steam account (big Sims fan in general). It wasn't until I got it a few months ago that I actually even had a clue on how to even properly play the game. But moving along from memory lane, this game is still amazing for being as old as it is.Having been released in 2003 and made available on Steam in 2010, this game and even the game series itself can honestly be seen as revolutionary for the city-building and simulation games that have followed since the original simcity was released. This game was almost in a way ahead of its time and in my opinion STILL outshines many other city-building games (maybe I haven't played enough but who knows) that try to recreate in their own sense the management strategy that SimCity brought upon the world of gaming. The replay value of this game is beyond compare, for something different is always awaiting you, and the mods are endless to build off what the game originally provided.The beauty about this particular game is that it can be both a ""place anything anywhere and watch what happens"" sort of game but it also can be a complex square by square city builder where you perfect every detail and the style of your houses to the taxes each individual industry and residential type pays. Many modern city builders try to play off this but say unlike City Skylines where you have to work your way up to get more land to begin with, there are countless areas and regions of all sizes for you to use and connect and even create to eventually have the ultimate city or state or nation or whatever you wish. Plus the music is pretty damn great as well. The game just allows you to almost settle down and lose yourself. SimCity 4 has to honestly be my FAVORITE city-builder out there, as it still is for many. But that's just a personal opinion. For it's current price of $19.99 and replay value that is seemingly endless, i'd say it's worth it.11/10 would obliterate city again and restart when things start to get out of hand			"

												TL;DR: Took a military jet to the nuclear plant and recreated chernobyl. Built safe zone city one region slot over. Raised volcano in safe zone city and burned all survivors. 10/10 would hijack expensive military equipment againActual review (yes, cities skylines taken into comparison):This is the supreme reigning king of city builders. While in time it will likely be beaten by Cities: Skylines, as of now this is still the best in terms of purely easy to use UI, fun things to do (the TL;DR is easily possible ingame), sheer number of mods, and customizability. I have thousands of hours in on the simcity series as a whole and only bought this on steam as another version (I still use disc/GoG versions more). The majority of the hours went into either 3000/unlimited or this version, both pre-and post-rush hour expansion (included in this one).Keep in mind this is also the HARDEST of the simcity games, and even on easy it is very possible to screw yourself over several hours in with a chronicly failing city that slowly decays into destruction on its' own. It's also one of the most fun, however, as SimCity 3000 did away with the terraforming (mostly) of simcity 2000, and this was the first (of 2) in the series to introduce regional gameplay with multiple cities interacting on a massive map. Big difference between this and the latest simcity, however, is that in addition to preset regions, YOU create them. You can terraform them, modify their size, city layouts/sizes literally using microsoft paint, plop the cities, set up the city interactions, etc. The only thing missing is the multiplayer, but with the city sizes in this being arguably 16 times larger than simcity 2013, that more than makes up for it as you will sink dozens of hours into filling up a map and customizing it the way you want to with what is also the best UI in the series, doing a lot of the work for you and letting you optimize where and when needed.So, why would I even recommend this over Cities: Skylines?AS OF RIGHT NOW. As of the time of this review, Cities: Skylines is a fantastic city builder with a mass modding community and...that's it. There is no regional play, terraforming has to be modded in to be performed mid-game, the art style is VERY bland and probably has less than 100 buildings the game can call upon to place down in zones, the UI when placing roads and such has a lot of issues that make it much harder to use than it should be, there's a lot of missing features that have to be modded in, and the ability to truly customize the city is significantly lower than in this game. While I will continue to play cities skylines, I have the game heavily - and I mean HEAVILY - modded to even begin to replicate the magic of SimCity 4 and its' predecessors. I feel like the game was designed around being better than SimCity 2013 which in some aspects (art, soundtrack, pure...fun things to do, customizability) it isn't, but the major missing things in SimCity 2013 (city sizes, DRM, lack of map editing) were what drew people in. That, and the game expected it so it would have a large modding scene to fix what the developers didn't add. That's understandable, as the dev team is VERY small for Cities Skylines, but the thing is that SimCity 2013 lowered the bar of city builders to a point where Cities: Skylines was no longer just below it, but far above it.Understand this: I WILL continue to play cities skylines. And I believe it is a great game. But it is going to take a monster that can do what Cities Skylines did to fix the SimCity 2013 formula, and also take the time to add in what SimCity does RIGHT, before there will be a city builder capable of dethroning this one. It has to look and play the part, and give the user the ability to have FUN above all with customizability, destruction, and other random things that occur (like piloting a military chopper guns blazing into your own house...like you can in this game).If you do NOT own this game and are a fan of city builders, I highly encourage you to get it now. At a price of $20 for the base AND its expansion, the only downside is compatibility with modern OS systems, and it is still possible to make it work with a bit of stuff done. What you're ultimately getting is the definitive city builder, and what remains the king of city builders that many of us fondly remember from our childhoods and will continue to remember. This is a timeless game in ways others simply cannot and likely will not ever live up to.			"

												The simulation genre wouldn't be what it is without the venerable SimCity series. Since 1989, the many entries in the line have allowed people to become virtual mayors and design cities of just about any shape and size, limited only by the contents of the game itself. They've come a long way from the original and branched out in many different ways across platforms, and not every instalment has been a success. SimCity 4 is often described as the last great SimCity, and with that and my own remembered fondness for it I decided to see how it's held up over the last 13 years.Honestly I find it a little difficult to describe the nature of SimCity, because it is such an elemental part of the genre. You lay down roads, outline zones for development of homes and businesses, build power plants and fire stations, balance your taxes against your utility expenditures, and grow your little town as large as it will go. These are all core concepts pioneered by the series, but 4 presents them with greater refinement. Each individual service building like police stations and hospitals can have their funding adjusted to meet local demand, so you can build expensive services and then scale them back to what you can afford until you need more. Zone density can also be scaled up or down without destroying existing buildings, allowing them to grow or shrink as needed.It's one of the purest and accessible presentations of the city-building formula out there, with no production chains or unlockables to concern yourself with. You build what you want, where you want, with the only limitations being space and money. SimCity 4 is far more generous than its predecessors with the latter, allowing you to start with enough money to cover most of a map right from the outset. And with control of individual building funding, it's a simple task to keep your budget in the green. The maps remain plenty large enough for bustling metropolises, but they're also connected by regions, allowing you to get a grand overview of your cities, granting your people the option of commuting to other areas, and creating massive metro areas with interconnected cities and neighborhoods.The end result is a robust and expansive city-builder limited only by its age. SimCity 4 is still a 2D game, despite some voxel trickery to make it look deeper and more dynamic than it is. You're laying everything out on a grid, which makes building at anything other than right angles either cumbersome in the case of roads and rails, or impossible in the case of buildings. The terrain is deformable and conforms to your constructions to a point, but if your landscape is very hilly at all you'll end up with houses built on soaring foundations larger than the dwelling itself, and beaches and piers plunging off of your coastlines into the deep. The detailed pixel art of the buildings is impressive, and each is rendered from four directions so you can rotate the camera, but they look chunky at max zoom and indistinct at a distance.Despite these shortcomings, SimCity 4 remains one of the finest city-builders you can lose yourself in. The steady pace of construction matched with the enormous variety of buildings and services to work towards means you can spend hours crafting a single city without having to wait for long periods or growing bored. The data displays show you everything you need to understand how your city operates, from pollution and traffic overlays to the actual routes your citizens take daily. There are even optional driving missions you can take in your own city and Sims you can move in to get more personal feedback. It might not be the prettiest or slickest offering anymore, but SimCity 4 has stood the test of time and remains one of the most addictive and comprehensive city-builders on the market.			"

												I have been playing SC4 since 2003, it has become a sort of ""zen meditation"" to me. It might scare people used to less ""demanding"" games since the latter simcity versions don't have such a deep management system, but once you get acquainted with that, it gets really funny and you can concentrate on creating wonderful cities, even by using plugins and mods. Possibilities are endless.The only problem I have is that my old macbook gets really, really hot when I play.			"

												This game is the bomb diggity, even after 13+ years.PROS:++Great, mostly balanced gameplay++Good looking 2.5D graphics++Endless amount of mods and assets++Has full 1080p support, in a *13 year old game!*++Runs pretty well on nearly anythingCONS:--Hard to get working properly (I suggest looking for the SC4Launcher and 4GB patch if you want to really boost how the game works)--Can crash a lot without the right settings--Mods are difficult to install w/o Steam Workshop support--The simulation is often finicky, but granted, there was only so much devs could do back then (pickup the Network Addon Mod for improved traffic simulation)--The tutorial isn't super-helpful in helping you understand how the regional simulation worksOverall, if you're looking at this vs Cities: Skylines (and have a PC that can run C:S), go pick up Cities. It's a newer game with generally a more powerful and realistic simulation. However, I highly suggest dropping this into your wishlist and waiting for a sale, which is quite often on this title, because this game has a certain charm that I don't think any city builder has or ever will replicate.

												Heavily recommended, Sim city 4 is still competing nowadays  to be the 1st city builder (and in my opinion it is). You are here to build a city and cover all it needs, from garbage management, energy distribution, crime reduction, tourism... Basically Sim city 4 is a big map divided in squares. On each square you can build a city, and all those cities are working with each other. In other terms, build Factory city with its large industries to provide some jobs for the citizens of the neighboring city of SunnyTown. It's pretty funny to handle and requires good attention to keep your world balanced!Graphically, the game is charming and the music is good. You can spend hours in it and it's rather addictive!It's also possible to mod the game to improve the road system and add various buildings.			"

												SimCity 4 > SimCity 5The game is quite fun even though it is old. It IS IMPORTANT to note that you need to put a code (look it up online if you want) into the start up of the game on steam, since the game does not use your computers multi processors. This prevents your game from crashing *cry*. Pros:-region view to see your cities. The game comes with London, San Francisco, Berlin, New York and two fantasy ones. - Development demand is based on your region, allowing specialization. - Lots of types of buildings that look old and new. - Famous American Landmarks and some international- The game is challenging, even on easy. - Day and Night.- Can name streets, rivers, land. (toggable)Cons:- No option to turn on Automatic disasters like in other games. (except for fire)- Public transport is difficult to work with and sims really just prefer driving.			"

												Who the hell doesn’t love a good city simulator? Just be nostalgic for a minute and remember your old middle school days spent huddled up in your room watching aliens destroy your precious creation that you were so proud of yet disappointing to your parents because you created something that couldn’t be taped to the fridge.  You get to be the oh so glorious mayor of Asshat-ville. Asshat-ville can become a glorious mecca if you, asshat, make it so. Create zones for industrial, commercial and residential buildings. Build roads and power lines and those train thingies no one ever uses. Although this game is for the glorious PC Master Race, the graphics aren’t all that glorious and the music will have you banging your head on your desk after a few solid hours. This classic SimCity rehash will have you happy to relive the good ole days, but if you’re looking for something a little more fancy, head over to Tropico for a more in depth gameplay. But if you’re just a fan boy looking for a nostalgia trip, then my dear asshat, this game is for you. 7/10			"

												When I bought this game half a year ago, I wasn't familiar at all with city-building games, but it was on sale and SimCity was of course a known franchise, so I bought it. When I started up the game for the 1st time I saw that I sometimes suffered from unexplainable graphical issues (colored lines ramdomly appearing on the screen). I went on. Then I noticed that the game sometimes chrashes (it happened to me about 10% of the times that I play it). I went on. Then I saw that I had been playing for hours. I went on.This game is just so good that I dont't really mind these issues that I have from time to time. It is just so nice to start from scratch and create the city of your dreams (or the City of Death, for that matter). But that's just the start. After you're done with one city you will want to start up another neighboring city and connect both. and then a third city. And a fouth. There is just so much replayability because every city has different terrain. And while I can say that it's definetely not easy to make (and keep) your city healthy , it's not too complex to handle.Since I bought this I have played more than 140 hours in 5 months time. For someone who also plays numerous other games, that's quite something. So yes, I'd definetely recommend this game if you have only a remote interest in city planning/management. It's already quite cheap normally, but when it's on sale there should definetely be no excuse for not buying this game if you think you will like it. It'll be worth the money.			"

												I had to buy the Steam version because my CD version was no longer working with Windows 7, and I tried all the command line add ons, SC4Launcher, etc... Nothing worked but I read that this game still worked via Steam. So, I took a chance and bought and I'm sure glad I did! Nothing beats Sim City 4, it is still the best in the series and worlds better than the newer iterations of it. I am so sad that they ruined this game after Sim City 4. This is by far the only real Sim City and the last true work of art by those who created Sim City to begin with. It is so detailed, so complex, yet so easy to learn how to play and make amazing beautiful cities. I highly recommend this game to those looking for a classic that was the zenith of all city building games.			"

												This is the definitive version of any SimCity. Much better than the sequel SimCity: Societies.TL;DR: Even though it is 13 years old it is still one of the best examples of a city builder today. I'd rate it  8/10 This game was one of the major contributors to Cities:Skylines as it is Paradox's main inspiration for the game. The U-Drive it Missions are unique to city builders wherein you can interact with your city on a much more indepth level. The economics aren't simplified and the advisors offer advise that can actually be used. For being a very fixed camera in an isometric setup, you get plenty of gorgeous angles and shots. The modding community for this game is still alive as far as I recall, although a lot of it is becoming harder to find certain things such as Network Addon Mod (NAM).  The main drawbacks of the game are mainly due to its age. Unlike Cities it isn't based on both a free building and grid based snapping system. This is solely grid based and it has a very big drawback, bridges. You can only build bridges certain directions and in straight lines. The other main drawback is performance issues on certain new machines and crashes. But I believe you can find a patch around for a fix for the crashes. A minor more nit-picky issue with the Steam version is that unlike a box you don't get a pamphlet that gives good advice about RCI and how to increase and meet demand, but again you can probably find a picture of the RCI pamphlet on the internet.Overall the game is excellent. Even though my hours on the Steam edition are lackluster, playing on the two-disk box version is where most of my hours really come from. As said above,  8/10  "

												We still have yet to see a true successor to the immense scale offered by SimCity 4. It has everything from the peaceful zen of settling a farming village in rolling hills, carving out a bustling coastal metroplolis, or the dirty fun of managing the man-made mountains of your region's garbage city.The modding community has really made this game shine. At the minimum I recommend the Network Addon Mod (NAM) because of the improved traffic simulator - even if you choose to not increase the road capacities or include new highway and rail components. A full NAM install will add a good bit of content, so choose carefully when doing a custom install if you dont want your menus to get too bloated.I have also managed to get the game running smoothly on my modern hardware (3770k + Radeon 7850). This game is known to erroneously detect moden Radeon HD 7xxx series GPUs as the old non-HD 7000 series. In the game's GraphicsRules.sgr file I commented-out the entire section on ""radeon slow path for partial depth buffer copies"" and added a new rule for the ""AMD Radeon HD 7000 Slow-Down Fix"" posted in the simtropolis forums - this resolved choppy scrolling issues.I also use the following launch options set in steam: -intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -d:directx  -w -CPUcount:1These options: disable intro, enable and set custom resolution, directX video output, windowed mode, use only one cpu.

												A quiet country town, a polluted industrial city or a modern and technological metropolis? The choice is yours.SimCity 4 is a city building strategy game that after 10 years (!) from its release remains one of the best in its category (personally the best). Your job is to be a major with the power to decide everything, from the terrain morphology to social politics of the city, it's urbanistic development, the transport ways and public services, from budget for education and health care to the one for police, etc...Very intuitive, you must provide jobs for the three social categories of inhabitants in the game (low wealth, medium wealth and high wealth), places to live and roads of communication to reach their job.Despite you are a sort of God or dictator, some council members will help you to administer the city, warning you of critical problems regarding specific categories such as traffic, education, pollution, public services' coverage and so on...PROS: A very good, intuitive simulationActive modding community Very detailed and great building varietyEnjoyable for a vast audience due its flexibilityFantastic graphic and low requirementsGood sound and effectsCONS:You can't play without modsSometimes could be frustrating Occasional crashes and rendering problems on modern machinesVERY ADDICTIVEConclusion: you will hate EA for the sequel of this fantastic game :D "

												I grew up with this game :) I read some of the negative reviews of this game to be objective.Most of the not recommended recviews are about new hardware and Windows 10. I do not exactly know if the game works well with high end graphics and operating systems but i will assume it works after some work arounds.Because if you can run this game and if you are a fan of city managing, this game is the most detailed game i know. Considering Cities XXL, Cities Skylines and City Worls. I am kind of a City building veteran :)This game is pretty hard and complicated. You will most probably bankrupt you first 4-5 cities. you have to master the income and outcome balance and peoples happiness. Every desicion counts. Every single unit on the map is important. Reources management and city planing is crucial.The game has advisors if there is something urgent to be adressed. And they might have good ideas too but do not go for all their ideas :) For example there are fires in the game and you have to dispatch units with your own hands. Sıo the advisor pops up and goes crazy in the middle of the screen. :)The game has terraforming, water and air and noise pollution, land value and desirability to guide you. Neighbouring cities can exchange resources for income. Schools and hospitals are covering an area, so you have to adjust and optimize residential and commercial ares acoording to these two. Fire and police stations are also effective within their reach. But you can dispatch fire truck from a corner of the city to another.Patient is the key to success in this game. Do not think you can just install the game and rise skylines. And i hope you can run the game on new operating systems and hardware.			"

One of the most solid and rewarding city manager simulator games on the market.This game make appear old, clunky, etc. but it is truely a jem, aside from nostalgia. Even though it has a steep learning curve it will provide one of the best experiences that only few games could provide. The game gives you complete freedom and provides you with a basic tutorial. When you begin playing it will be a lot of trial and error but it eventually pays off once you are able to run and grow an efficient and large size city. Currently I only have 30+ hours on my steam record, that is because most of them are played offline or on the cd version.If you enjoy games like Cities: Skylines, I really do recommend you pick this up while it's on sale and give it a try.Sadly, the game is designed to be played on older OS's and will not function well or at all without downloading a tool to optimize it.  Here is a tutorial that should help. If you are still struggling, check SC4 Devotion for help.	 "

												(Ignore the few hours on record, I bought this because my disk version stopped working)A great game that sucks hours out of you but makes you feel like those hours were worth it. I have spent at least 70 hours in this but every time I turn off the game I can always look back and feel like I actually did something worthwhile. My only complaint (and it's only a complaint cause I need to get good) is that building skyscrapers is so so difficult. In all the time I have played this game I have built a single skyscraper and it went out of buisness IMMEDIETLY. They are hard, I hear mods make this a lot easier but I just feel like that is a cop out. "

												This is still the best city simulator around! Might be going on 10yrs old, and have its limitations but just as addictive and fun to play. Decent mod community too and can run in 1920x1080 with some launch tweaks!If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations! "

												Despite being fourteen years old at the time of this review, this game is still entertaining. I think a huge part of it is how well it ages - it came out in 2003, but there are no musical or UI or humor clues that would tie it to the early 2000s. It's still one of the best city simulators out there, and if you're willing to add these to your launch options (or Google platform specifics):     -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -f -intro:off you won't experience any issues with the game crashing, plus you get to play it in HD. The modding community is still alive and well, somehow. But most of all, SC4 just looks good. The art style is cohesive, the colors and day-night cycles are on point (mostly), and despite almost everything being 2D pixel graphics it looks beautiful, especially if you know how to arrange your city. My one issue is that the game, like any single-player simulation, feels a little lonely sometimes. And if you get creative with Dropbox you can play a sort-of multiplayer, but there's no true MP built into the game. It's a good thing for the most part, because there's none of the always-online ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that comes with a lot of ""single-player"" games these days.Basically, if you like any of the tycoon games, Civ, or model railroads, this game's for you. You can raise the difficulty if you want a more hardcore planning-focused experience, or mod in some demand multipliers if just want to build some nice interchanges.			"

												Honestly this is probably my favorite game of all time. If you played the new SimCity and often thought ""Huh, that seems like a dumb feature,"" you'll probably find that SimCity 4 alleviates most of these complaints. In my mind, there are three key differences between this game and the newest SimCity:1. Non-agent based simulation: SC4 instead opts for a big-picture, numbers-based simulation. You'll find that this opens up many features that are highly preferrable to the agent modelling in the new SimCity, while still maintaining an acceptable level of simulation. This leads into the next difference.2. City / Region size: With the less intensive processing involved in all the population dynamics, cities and regions are MUCH larger than the new game. There are no bare spots between cities; the whole world is yours to control. Want to make a complex highway system, servicing key neighborhoods and moving high volumes of traffic? Go right ahead. Highways are woefully prebuilt in the new game. Would you instead like to focus on public transit? The options are all there and in greater depth than the new SimCity. As a result of the larger size, the game feels much more open to creativity despite the lack of curved roads.3. Modding: While the newest game just recently announced support for offline mods, you'll find that SC4 is far better off in the modding community. Many overhaul mods are available to give more transit options, better modelling, more buildings, and other assorted features. If you don't like something about this game, it's likely there's a mod to fix it.Those three features are the main reasons why SimCity 4 is a far more rewarding experience than the new SimCity will ever be. Considering all this, and that SC4 can be had for $5 very easily, why would you choose the new one?  I'm just now picking up a copy on Steam because who knows when my old CD will stop working from damage or something.			"

												Pretty much the best citybuilder and one of my most played games of all time. I own a physical copy of it, and I recently picked up this Steam copy... definitely one of my favorite games ever.You need to mod the game in order to make it playable, and the game tends to crash, lock up, and run slowly. There's no autosave and you'll probably lose a lot of hours of gameplay. Loading a custom region is cumbersome, installing mods is archaic, and the whole thing is just clunky. Using some mods will require literal hours of patience... ask me about custom highways or building a mass transit network. Piece by piece, slowly, surely, but satisfyingly.Beneath all the clunk is a diamond, the absolute best city builder of all time. Every game that comes out can't seem to match a well-modded Simcity 4. You can install a massive amount of options for mass transit and building variety. It's intoxicating, if you're into it.If you just want to build a pretty city, you're going to need to work slowly and learn how to do it. This game honestly isn't friendly or accessible for new people... But if you work at it, and you enjoy the genre, you're going to love it.			"

												Still, today, this is one of the top city building games. It has all the great things that the previous Sim City titles had, and improves on them. It has a ton of content created by the community, which adds an infinite variety of buildings and features.I actually prefer Sim City 4 over many of the newer city builders. Main reason is its simplicity. I do like modern city builders, but sometimes they can get quite complex. Also, I like symmetry in my cities, and the newer games make it a little hard sometimes to achieve this. The straight-cut grid may be limiting in some ways, but very gratifying in others.			"

												11 years old and still an amazing game, especially with the modability. Still waiting on that next great city builer sim, though...Cities: Skylines came close, but it's just not what I'm looking for. How many more years will it be before someone steps up and makes a better city sim than this? It's not looking very likely at this point. One thing I like about this game is the realism. You zone land, it starts constructing, then you have plausible buildings start to pop up. Something I can't stand about modern city simulators is this cheesy, colourful, unrealistic look it has. I want my cities to actually look like they do in the real world...Not a ♥♥♥♥ing 3D cartoon city where Jimmy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed Neutron lives.			"

Also has excellent mods which VASTLY improve the gameplay; some of them considered essential for fun gameplay.Since this is a city-building game and has no finite city-size due to regions, there is essentially no limit to how long you can play. It is very satisfying to build a huge region with many cities and develop it over a lone period of time.			"

												In SimCity 4, you are the mayor of a city. You build streets and roads, zone zones for people to build houses, corporations to build offices and services and industries to build factories on and you build public services like police and healthcare and parks and publictransportation. The game is really really good in itself, but what really makes it so good that I'd call it my favorite game of all times is the wide range of mods the community made over the years, and I'd certainly call it the greatest citybuilder still.

												+++++++++++++++ Review +++++++++++++++This is THE greatest city builder of all time. Today's reiterations like Cities: Skylines can't touch the beauty and intricacy of this game. Its ""2.5 Dimension"" style graphics style will probably never be seen again, and it's something you'll have to experience to appreciate. Note that there's a huge difference between 'SC4' and a 'heavily modded SC4' - the community is still very much so alive on Simtropolis and SC4 Devotion, making great free addons to this game with real world buildings, restaurants, road addons, landmarks, trees and everything else you can imagine. Hardcore players of SC4 are typically sandbox builders and don't care for the actual game aspect - you can create some pretty mind blowing scenery with this game and the right mods. With that being said, it's a game with an insane amount of replay value...not just beacuse it has no ""end,"" but it's a relaxing scenery builder that will give you a great deal of therapy through the years.+++++++++++++++ About the Steam Version of Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++If you're like me and have been playing SC4 from the original disc, it's worth re-purchasing it through a Steam sale to get this patched version, because SC4 does not work well from the get-go. You will need to do a little work to get the game to run on Windows 10, but this will simply take a couple minutes...here's what you need to know:+++++++++++++++ Getting Sim City 4 To Run On Modern Day PCs +++++++++++++++The version of Sim City 4 DX that you get from Steam is ""1.1.641.0"", which means that the old ""EP1 Update"" (UPDATE_SKU1_TO_P1.EXE) and ""SC4Update4BAT"" (SC4Update4BAT.EXE) are already included, and you won't have to hunt them down on the internet. These patches were necessary if you had the old CD version of the game; otherwise, buildings would not light up during the night time cycle.Once you install the game, you'll have to edit its Steam launch options, which is pretty quick and easy:- In Steam, click ""LIBRARY"" in the main menu.- Next, right click ""SimCity 4 Deluxe"" in the right-side menu, and choose ""Properties""- Right within the GENERAL tab is a button called ""SET LAUNCH OPTIONS..."" - click it.- In the field provided on this final pop-up, paste in the following variable string:-w -intro:off -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1200x32 -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high(These variables are: -w (wide screen), -intro:off (skips past the annoying intro that runs every time the game opens, -CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1200x32 (this tells the game to run at your monitor's resolution, change it if you have to), -CPUCount:1 -CPUPriority:high (this is the most important part...Sim City 4 cannot run on more than 1 core, so you have to force the program to run on only one. Otherwise, the game won't run).+++++++++++++++ Getting Mods for Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++Mods make this game what it is - you won't believe how different it will look once you've added some custom content. The two best sites on the internet for mods are Simtropolis and SC4Devotion. Even after all these years, the communities for SC4 are thriving on these sites. They'll also have plenty of resources that tell you exactly how to unpack and install mods - it's pretty easy.The essential mods you'll really want (or have?) to get are:- ""NAM (Network Addon Mod)"": adds a ton of new realistic roads, interchanges, ramps, etc.- ""SC4 DAT Packer"": makes the game more stable by centralizing your mods into one big file- ""Cheats By Buggi"": allows you to input a bunch of different cheats that will make your life easier if you're looking to play this game in sandbox mode+++++++++++++++ Standalone Mods for Sim City 4 +++++++++++++++There are two notable standalone mods for Sim City 4. They install as separate programs:- ""SC4 Terraformer"": this program is really old and a little clunky, but it will all you to hand sculpt a Sim City 4 map by drawing mountains, valleys, hills, etc with your mouse across any or all regions - even over borders, which is impossible to do in-game. The regions can then be imported into your game.- ""SC4 Mapper"": This program lets you modify the size of the regions in a current Sim City 4 map. If you wanted regions to be bigger or smaller, or if you wished that the borders of a certain region were located somewhere else (like, one region on your map that is not 90% water and 10% land), you can edit them with this program.

												The crowning achievement of the SimCity IP; SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition delivers all of the best features and systems of each of the previous versions into this better and improved offering.  Some would argue that SimCity 5 was a more improved version, and to them I say this, Origin was not inolved in the making of SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition and therefore is the much improved title!  The need to be always connected to the Internet in SImCity 5 killed the game for me, I love the option of Online Interaction but hate that I cannot play the game as a single player Offline; thanks again Origin!  The addition of Sim interaction in this game was wonderful, the ability to add your own Sims to your cities and get their oppionions about specific things was sorley missied in this title's predicesors.  Having played all previous versions I had always longed for an in-game method for dertermining which things about my city were small annoyances to my populace but not major enough for my advisors to complain about.  These things would affect your mayoral rating as well as have an effect on which Sims would move into and out of certian areas.  Furthermore, the addition of the ""Piloting"" mechanics added a new layer of depth to the game while offering new construction options to the player for accomplishing different missions.  If you loved any of the previous SimCity games, this one will not dissapoint!			"

												The game shows it's age (more so when coming to compatibility/performance) on new machines but this game is so freaking fun to mess around in. It can be difficult to master but when you get it right it's like you've successfully dunked a biscuit in tea and it didn't flop and sink into the tea.That's how good you'll feel when you get a great town going Also in regards to compatibility and getting the best performance this launcher helps so much and it's easy.http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28544-sc4-launcher/ Here is a great guide for it as well


Know How: Play Simcity 4 on Modern hardware 
A Guide for SimCity 4 Deluxe
By: Ajito Daikitsu

			Simcity 4 is a  10 years old  game. Yes, its launched in 2003, on Steam since 2010. It is the best of Simcity series to date (compared with Simcity 2013). But it was... 10 years old.

SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition is a city building and management simulator. Elected Mayor over a city-to-be or existing city, manage city development by laying roads, plotting land and zoning, constructing public service buildings and maintaining financial balance as you thrive to build a megalopolis.Pros: You are giving a lot of flexibility, from zoning density to street type. As your city grow, additional selection of power plants become available, and additional needs are requested such as water treatment facilities, trains and subways, ports and airports, as well as a variety of educational establishments, health and emergency services. You have a good list of additional tax options, each with their own downside and benefits. Keep a balance between how much financing you can afford, and how much you need, to give to each of your public services (as a whole or per individual buildings). More special buildings and landmarks become available as your population rises. You can even connect your different cities togetter with your streets, highways and railroads, if they are located on neighboring tiles on the map.Cons: You are limited to determining individual land plots and zoning type, with little control on what will actually be built. You may have small shops and fast food being build on high-density commercial areas you were planning to have towering office buildings on, or maybe cheap low-cost apartment blocks will appear on residential zones you wanted luxury condos in. City interconnection requires you to actually build the neighboring city, its streets not necessarily being aligned with each other's connections. Tax revenue is hard to come by, and you'll often catch yourself speeding up time and wait years to get enough money to continue building without resorting to high-interest loans. Public service coverage is radius-based, which forces you to finance overlapping territory, or leave out coverage in-between your schools, police stations and hospitals.Verdict: ★★★☆☆ - It's up to youThe amount of micro-management you have, plotting individual land plots, and the amount of effort it needs to reach actual high-density buildings, makes SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition more of a town simulator than a large urban sky-scrapper city simulator. Still, it remains a good example of the genre and the best game in its franchise.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.

												In my opinion this is still the best city sim ever made and for one reason; zones! You don't have to place each building or square, you can insted zone an area and buildings will grow inside those zones. Also the global mechanic works well, if you build lots of farms in one area and lots of dirty industry in another then you will have huge growths waiting for you when you play your comercialized mega city!

												For an older game SimCity4 is worth playing in my opinion.  I know a lot of people get frustrated with this game because it tends to lag a little once your cities get bigger but, I dont't think its the end of the world its still very playable. Within this series, I've played SimCity 2000('93) when my brother introduced me to it then I moved on to SimCity 4 and I've been hooked ever since. Another thing I've noticed about this game is that, you need a lot of patience and most people don't bother and they give up. The reality is SimCity 4 is very strategic because, you must think way ahead of time when laying out your city and think of future problems like traffic. I'd suggest taking your time and not try to rush growth of your city because, you'll run out of funds very early. It takes time to build a solid foundation so that you can have a decent mount of monthly income. Everyone who plays this game figure out what strategy works for them but, don't let the occasional frustration steer you away. Overall, I think this game is very fun to play and you can let you imagination go wild with the extra downloads you can add to your city.			"

												This game is incredible. The Graphics are very detailed and realistic. You can build more than one city on the same map. Not to mention importing your own Sims from ""The Sims"" into the game. Your city just doesn't sleep like that of SimCity 3000. You see your people walking about and running their daily lives, like walking their dogs, Driving to the supermarket, Driving their kids to school even going to church!The biggest improvement that I saw in SimCity 4 were the disasters. In SimCity 3000 you had like what? 4? In SimCity 4 you get over eight disasters. The best part is that you can control and decide where your Tornado goes. You also get Volcanoes that erupt, Erathquakes that bury houses and split open the earth, Meteor showers that leave everlasting craters andLightning Bolts, Fires, Riots, Floods, Mudslides, Bank Robberies and even Car chases. You get to choose you terrian styles. You can ahve an African style with Rhino's and Giraffes. Sometimes they can even stampede into your city.The other great thing about SimCity 4 is the terrian tools. You can sculpt gorgeous, Lagoons, Cliffs, Craters, Valleys and even place galiciers. Then you have the time settings. A 1900's Chicago style, A 1950'S New York Style, And a 2000s Houston Style. Then there is the animations of the construction of buildings. When you build your buildings they just don't appear out of no where tou actually see your sims get into their work trucks and start to construct the building. And if the building is of no use anmore it decays and doesn't turn into a huge big purple borded up mess. Then if you want to destroy or knock down a building it just doesn't disappear, you can actually impload or expload your buildings from any side you wish. There are no old buildings from SimCity 3000, The're totally new realistic looking buildings in SimCity 4.To me all this extra stuff makes this game totally anew. You won't get board if you like Simulation games.			"

												With a fantastic soundtrack and an immense level of detail (considering it was made well over a decade ago) I found this game extremely immersive. It was fun setting the nuclear power plants ablaze and driving around trampling sims and cars alike with my tanks.However, one drawback for me were the 'advisors' (Nagging children in disguise) constantly popping in unannounced at random intervals and whisking me away to the other side of town to have me do some remedial task such as 'replace a power plant' or ""cure a case of low funding""  causing me to grossly misplace a monument I've been saving up for.Nonetheless, great game, always stay faithful to Doctor Vu.

												I first played SimCity 4 in 2005 and instantly fell in love with it. Back then, I clocked in hundreds of hours of playtime and to this day it remains my favorite city builder of all time.The graphics, although they may appear a little dated to modern eyes, still hold up exceptionally well.The most important aspect, the gameplay, is just as great as it was back in the day. You can create everything from a polluted industrial wasteland to a shining metropolitan utopia and everything in between. Although easy to learn, the game can be quite complex: you can manage everything from the topography to transportation routes in your city.Although a minor point, it's worth mentioning that SimCity 4's soundtrack is superb. It definitely contributes to the game.Additionally, there is still an active modding community for this game. There are mods that add new buildings, transportation options, custom textures, and various other things that improve the game overall.One minor criticism I have is that a little work is required to get everything running properly on modern hardware, but there are a couple of guides available on the community hub for this. After tinkering with Steam's launch options for a few minutes, I had no further issues.Overall, I highly recommend SimCity 4, especially if you like city builders. It is a classic and easily one of the best examples of its genre.			"

												Let me start off by saying this is much better than the 2013 buggy mess that was Simcity.Though this game can be quite difficult for beginners, understanding of what to do and how to get out of debt can be quite challengeing but when you finally understand the core basics the game becomes fun and easy to play.I GIVE IT A 8/10 FOR EFFORTPHILLL			"

												Definitely hit the spot when I was craving a city builder game. The music is kind of fun, and not intrusive. The police car cases were a nice way to pass time while the city was developing. Not the easiest set up, but the tutorial answered most of the questions I had.			"

												Despite being over a decade old, this game remains the champion of its genre, thousands of modifications and additional buildings extend the gameplay into the eternity. That being said, game could use a bump in graphics/performance department. It's clearly not made for the powerful gpus available today, even though the graphics aged pretty well. Performance suffers a lot.All in all, amazing game that you can now get for close to nothing!			"

												     How does one go about writing a review for something like this? To some it feels like DLC for Simcity 3000, for others it's an amazing stand-alone title. So what about me, where do I stand? I reside in the latter category beliveing this is an amazing game on its own. But how amazing? Ladies, gentlemen, and others, my name is Mlobitz and welcome to this review. Today, Simcity 4. Let's jam! And yes I did just quote Arkada, DEAL WITH IT.     When I was still 11 and browsing the Steam Summer Sale of 2013 (roughly a year ago) and a game caught my attention. You see, at the time I was obsessed with what I called them ""Retro Games"" and all the history they might hold. One of my favorite games from the NES/SNES era was Simcity. Rather simple but very rewarding and interesting, the original Simcity melted away countless hours of 5th Grade (when I was still 10). So when I saw Simcity 4 on Steam for $5.99 I hade to check it out.      Starting out, I had a hard time figuring out what to do, this is no simple game to learn. The in-game tutorials aren't very helpful except for teaching you the bare-basics of the game. I had to watch a large amount of YouTube videos to be remotely successful. Math is also required to make effective grids whether you use unit distace or cost to measure length of roads or avenues. To even get skyscapers in your city and make it look like a city, you need extensive knowledge and mastery of the game's concepts. One example of this was when my technology teacher let us play Simcity 4 on her computers every once in a while (she's an awesome teacher by the way), most of the students ended up skipping the tutorial and spamming disasters on barren terrain. One of my friends who played through the tutorials couldn't sustain a good income and generally didn't know what he was doing.  Accessibility gets a below average 4.2 out of 10.     On to the good bits! When I finally got things up and running the game became challenging yet addicting and rewarding, I also felt proud when my city was filled with plenty of houses, shops and factories. The GUI can be hard to learn but once you get used to it it's efficient contains everyhting it needs to and more! It's cool when your perfectly laid-out grid is functioning perfectly while also being pretty.The journey to getting your city to this state is highly enjoyable and satisfying. One of the biggest things that makes this game so much fun to play is region gameplay. This lets you connect your cities and let them share resources such as power and water. This allows certain cities to provide certain things while being kept alive by other cities while keeping them alive. Maybe a city based around power getting water from a city based around water. Being as great as it is, gameplay gets a very good 8.6 out of 10.     In terms of visuals there's not much to cover, for a 2D game in 2003 it's pretty standard fare. Although some 3D models like cars planes, and helicopters are a nice addition. zooming in reveals a lot of little details maxis has included like a giant spinning pizza at the pizza restaurant and clotheslines in houses' backyards. skyscrapers have and other large builings have little details like a pool near the top floor. Visuals gets a strong 7.8 out of 10.     As for the music, I'm gonna come right out and say it, this my favorite video game soundtrack of all time. The music not only fits the game fantastically any track is amazing music to listen to while doing something like schoolwork or.... other schoolwork! Yeah.... Check out the whole soundtrack on YouTube, you owe it to yourself to do so. This soundtrack a masterpiece, so it gets a well deserved 10 out of 10.     After finding the mean of all my scores, SImcity 4 recieves a respectable 7.65 out of 10. "

												This game is one of the greatest games I've ever played in my entire life. I've found countless hours of repeated playthroughs of huge, sprawling, and picture-realistic cities. Each time I found myself getting better and better by the minute. This game by far makes SC2013, the recently ""incredible"" game EA released for the franchise, look like an ant. Plus, this was released about the same time Maxis was purchased out by EA, so it's not been infested by their evil deeds and their gruesome marketing schemes. Anyways, back to the game... There's so much to do in it! Though it IS by fact an old game, this game stands the test of time because it's probably one of the most played Sim Cities still in the franchise, being matched by SC2000 (Don't get me wrong, the games before SC4 in my honest opinion were also golden games, they all sooth my needs for a wonderous city construction game). It started off a bit shabby when it was first released, but when they pumped the Rush Hour pack into it, man oh man, the game was 1,000 times better! Not only that, but if you search around the web, you can find loads and loads and LOADS of addons, mods, and other things for the game to make your experience grand. Currently, I have over 250 mods in my game which consist of buildings of all sorts, land reskins, huge road addons for mega highways, and so much more! I know I seem like I'm boasting far too much about this game, but it's really this good. Hell, I'm probably underrating it for all I know, because this game is amazing!			"

I put about 30 hours and more to come! Great game, runs on any computer great. Very fun and long lasting. BUu you might have a hard time if your a noob. So, good luck!			"

												This is the game that Simcity 5 should've been.Simcity 4 is the best city builder around.It has it all: a dedicated modding community, a ton of content (and a great DLC too), deep gameplay, and just pure awesomeness.I find myself getting hooked into this game, with the massive regions to fill up with cities and then when I'm done, I get to look at it all in great detail.The game offers a lot of content and gameplay with smallest of details. I love this game so much. If you want a great stragety base city builder, this is the way to go. Not even Cities: Skylines can manage to be this great in terms of detail and gameplay depth.Well, if being the mayor of a city is your dream, well that dream has come true. Pick this game up when it goes on sale and you'll have a lot of fun.But please note: This game is from 2003. Expect graphics bugs, optimization issues or anything along the lines of that. If you do experience problems with gameplay, remember to look online for solutions. Many people have posted solutions to this problem. Try them all before posting your negative review. If you give up on this game so easily by just giving a negative review and leaving it to rot without even trying a solution, you'll miss out on one of the best city builders ever made.			"

This just combines all the best of the genre. the one issue is the traffic. the vanilla traffic system is pretty bad and if your city gets anywhere near a large population you're gonna suffer some massive congestion. which is why I strongly recommend getting the traffic mod for the game, it fixes some routing issues and also increases the street max traffic volume amount by 4x. http://www.moddb.com/mods/network-addon-modyou can probably also find some addons for different powerplants and other well... cheaty things online. definetly recommended so get out there and biuld.

												Good overall game to play if you want to build a realistic city. However if you want to add mods to the game a bit of an issue. The game especially on windows 10 can't hold that many downloads (mods). If you want to be able to add say more than 20 mod downloads I recommend buying the disk copy. Also there are some bugs that should have been fixed from the rush hour version I think. The main one is the annoying no job icon.			"

I used to have a cd version of this, but i lost it after 10 years so i picked it up on 2,5 Euro on the sale, dam that price. You wan""t se a good game for this price and to be this high age to. The only thing i don""t like about the steam version is that i have no way knowing how to change the languages from English to Norwegian, i prefer this type of games in my own native language and i think the steam verion don""t follow with Norwegian, but comes with dannish and swedish and some another europe language if you buy from europe.

Id hoped the series would continue to inspire young minds with games about building and nurturing something, and then optionally destroying it.This iteration of Simcity is in soul the last and in my opinion most engaging and merciful of them all. It has plenty of quality community mods that have been around for ages for those who would want to pile more detail and micromanagement on a game thats already everything to do with micromanagement. I tried Cities, its not bad, but the game play is simply not intensive and micromanagey enough for me. Neither one is a replacement for the other.			"

Looking in the forums and online there are all sorts of tricky things you can do to improve the performance with newer hardware, but that is a hassle.  If you are lucky enough to get it running well on your machine, this is the definitive version of Sim City, way better than the newest iteration.  I grew up playing SC 2000, and this feels like a nice upgrade from that experience.			"

												Welcome to Sim City 4. In my humble opinion, this product right here is the pinnacle of city building simulator games humanity has ever been able to create. Don't be blindsided by later releases of this franchise or any other city building franchise for that mater. Sim City 4 builds upon previous entries in the franchise and doesn't fail to deliver. Neglect the fact that its old, it still looks fantastic and runs well on modern and old systems alike.You might ask yourself: city building must sure be boring. You little fool, you have no idea what you're missing. Planning out industrial, residential, commercial office zones, watching them grow, setting up hospitals, fire, police and schools so the city can evolve, planning out streets, roads, highways, mass transit systems, water, trash, energy so the city can live... this game has it all. I won't go into detail as there would be too much to tell, but its worthy to mention that in the end, you can crash all your hard work by calling a giant robot to destroy the city... or maybe spawning a volcano in the middle of downtown. Tornados and meteorites are classics too.There's always plenty to do in sim city, if any game should grab your attention, this should certainly be one of them.			"

												The jewel that came before The Sims.... (by this I mean the whole SimCity series, not this game). When you aren't statisfied with controlling a whole family with only your mouse and your keyboard, then you can have this! SimCity 4 is perfect if you want to control a whole city, just how the way you want. Whant to fly and helicopter? Drive a car? Stop reading this and buy the game already!			"

												The classic and original Sim game - as good as it gets minus performance issues. SimCity 4 offers great replayability and complexity, with an insane amount of player-created content available on the internet. The learning curve is less than linear, with basic city building as easy as it has ever been, but end-game being at least as complicated as it has ever been (GameFAQs has some good write-ups to help newbies). The only notable drawback (other than tame gameplay, but hey, it's a SIM!) is how poorly SimCity performs on budget and entry-level PCs. Just lower the default settings to the lowest and slowly crank them up and you won't have a problem.			"

												Simcity 4 requires a LOT of tweaking to run on a modern system. It will NOT run properly on systems with multi-core processors and it will not run correctly at 1920x1080 out of the box. Once you edit some configuration files, the game runs but you're still going to run into issues. If you're willing to pop the hood and get your hands dirty, this is the last true SimCity title. EA owned Maxis by this point, but the company had SimCity 4 already in development beforehand and was able to release the title with little interference from their new abusive parent company. Electronic Arts then proceeded to completely absorb and destroy Maxis, leaving SimCity 4 as its epitath. RIP Maxis.			"

												At this point, SimCity 4 Deluxe is a creaky classic, and no longer an indispensable one. If you're considering a citysim game you should weigh this alongside its predecessor SimCity 3000 and its figurative successor Cities: Skylines. If you already love the game, it's probably worth a Steam purchase if you haven't already. If you're still undecided, read on.SimCity 4 was and still is commonly regarded as the pinnacle of its series by citysim enthusiasts. With the release of Cities: Skylines however, many of those same enthusiasts have seen that game as the new king of the genre. After a decade and change, it seems SC4's life as the premier citybuilder is coming to an end, and Skylines' is just beginning.Mind you, SC4 still delivers a great citybuilding experience. Whether you should actually play it depends on your affinity for the SimCity series, your attitude towards its complexity and your appetite for tinkering with the game to get it working.SC4 is unquestionably the deepest, richest SimCity game, but for some people it can probably get too complicated. It was released in 2003, and it doesn't play nice with newer computers. Custom mods truly bring the game to life, but each one has to be manually downloaded and configured.This can become annoying if not downright anal when you take into account the multiple separate dependency files that contain textures, items and other things that most mods use; a holdover from the waning days of dial-up...that morphed into creator pride which refused to allow the distribution of files with the mods that actually used them. Also, if you don't organize your plugins folder, hunting down trouble with your plugins can be a nightmare.If none of that sounds appealing? SimCity 3000 is older, but it's easily available on Good Old Games[www.gog.com] and delivers the series' best balance of accessibility and challenge. Meanwhile, Cities: Skylines is easier to run, has Workshop support for mods and takes inspiration from SC4 while improving on it in certain aspects. With the release of additional expansion packs, patches and Workshop mods, its depth may come to rival and even surpass SC4's, all while still maintaining a little more accessibility. Skylines is new too, so if you're deciding between SC4 and Skylines, the latter will probably give you more value.I suppose SimCity 4's primary draws at this point are its pedigree and its region play. If you already know you don't like SC4's region play on the other hand then I guess it won't matter to you. For genre and series enthusiasts, it can at least be interesting seeing how SC4 remained a dominant game for so long.Cities: Skylines gives you the option of purchasing more land to make into new districts, and the amount of land can be increased with mods. SC4 though gives you entire geographical regions of varying sizes to build multiple interconnected cities on, not to mention the capacity to download others' or make your own.Region play is fascinating and very in-depth, which enhances the depth of the actual citybuilding. Unfortunately, there's no option to build a singular city by itself like in Skylines or previous SimCity titles, and you pretty much need to start other cities to have them grow past a certain point.SC4 also has over a decade's worth of custom content from its dedicated community, some of which is truly excellent & high-quality and extends the game considerably. Having a lot of mods however makes the game slower and sometimes more prone to errors, and you still need to manually download and place them in your plugins folder, so strategic downloading is advised.If you're into it enough, it's worth it to go to the master dependency list on SC4Devotion[www.sc4devotion.com] and download everything there so you don't have to hunt for them when you download a mod. Even that list was last updated in 2008 though, so you still need to cross-reference dependencies for what you download. Since Skylines is easier to mod for and download mods for, that game will catch up eventually anyway, so this isn't as big of an advantage.If you're gonna play this game, here's a couple things you should keep in mind.As mentioned above, the game's over a decade old and can be finicky on newer machines. The game still chugs when running large cities. To optimize the game, I recommend the tips in this thread.You ABSOLUTELY NEED a couple of mods to make SimCity 4 playable. The Network Addon Mod in particular unscrews the traffic algorithms so your transit network doesn't degenerate into a kafkaesque nightmare. There's a couple other quality-of-life fixes floating around that aren't as important, but still go a long way towards making the game more playable.Patience is a virtue, and saving is important despite whatever the tryhard idiots on /v/ will tell you. SimCity 4 will remind you of both whenever it crashes, which is always more often than you'd like.			"

Very satisfying when it goes smoothly, and frustrating when you forget something, or miss something.Also, don't forget to check out the Plugin Pack if you are playing the Deluxe Edition that includes the Rush Hour expansion pack.You'll have to google for it.

												This game is very fun and enjoyable. Improving on the great Simcity 2000, everything is classic Simcity with improved graphcs. (looks 3D enough to be considered modern, though the resolution is not the best) I consider it the last game of the classic series. The newer Simcity games deviated from the classics a bit. In this game you play as the mayor of a city, building roads, power plants, police stations, schools to satisfy your citizens while maintaining a balanced budget. The schools and hospitals are similar to games of its genre. The transportation options are really detailed. You will have different types of roads, railways, ferry, bus and subway. You can also connect to neighboring cities, buying garbage capacity, water, and electricity. There is a little addition that allow you to control vehicles and complete missions on your streets. I consider it a small enhancement, not really important but sometimes giving you nice bonus cash to ease the game out a bit.The only thing I am not able to recommend is the price. $20 for a game from 2003 is not justifiable. The game goes on sale for $5 during holidays. Would recommend buying it during sales.			"

												Simcity 4 was, and still is, the best city-planning simulator.It have very deep game mechanics, which ensure the city simulation is dynamic. It is nearly impossible to just ""pan out""more zones without many different issues. Most of these issues will have  affect on the population, and this would cause other issues, etc. All the city planning simulators came after it failed to reach its level in terms of complexity. And it is friendly toward beginners. ( Hint: After go wild building for a while, you may want to go back to check the tutorials.) Its graphic is outdated.The game engine is not very effective. (One of the devs explained that is because the game was built before DirectX 9) The camera is fixed. Look at the screenshots and determine yourself. The game is ""moddable"". The UI and the engine can not be edited. But all the data and the models are. This results in a great collection of building (and other thing on ground) mods. Most of them requires manual install, and sometimes need additional dependency. They can be found on Simtropolis or SC4devotion.com.The most important mod for Simcity 4 is Network Addon Mod, or NAM. It is a great improvement, if not overhaul, of traffic system. I recommend anyone who plan spending more than 10 hours on this game to install it. Due to engine restrictions, build a tram-in-avenue/tram-on-road interchange or underground tunnel is more complex than it should. But at least you can do it, with patience and time.			"

Even Paradox's Cites Skylines doesn't come close to what this game can provide. I realize I'm not offering much to review in terms of gameplay or features but know that I have yet to play anything that provides anywhere near the level of entertainment this game provides.

It's the same 2004 game slapped with a no-cd,that's all it is and all you will get. Make sure to save a lot,there were a lot of random crashes with the game too.This is just sad that this game could've been more stable. Hell,there's not even 1080p resolution. You're stuck with 1600x900 if you don't use any mod. tl;dr : This game is great,but way too buggy as is. Save a lot. Would definitely recommand though "

												Even though I now played Cities:Skylines,this game is indeed a legend. I actually played over thousands of hours in this game,though unfortunately on pirated version because back then I don't have any means for online purchases.I finally fetched this game for legit during 2014 Summer Sale,and played it until C:SL came out(actually preordered it).The graphics maybe old,but this game is 100% moddable and it's modding community is still strong.Long time players should have heard names like Pegasus,Deadwood,HKBAT,SimGoober,NDEX,ks_JPN,DuskTrooper and the must famous of all,NAM Team. These are the guys that make SC4 even more epic and they still releasing new ones.Even though many would migrate to C:SL,if you need to feel the nostalgia(like me),curious about how city building game looks like before C:SL or simply because you machine can't handle C:SL,then this game can perform the same(albeit 1GB of mods required)			"

Not only was it a great flashback, it's been really rewarding. The interface is simple but the game is challenging. I highly recommend playing with a cheatcode for adding money; I tend to flounder without it, and it's plenty challenging even with it. My only complaint: you cannot be good at this game if you play like a libertarian.			"

****1/54.5 out of 5City Builder of its time.Simcity 4 is the fourth followup in the detailed and engaging city builder series Simcity. Simcity 3000 and 4 are the only the ones I've played and generally see them on par as each other, whilst Simcity 4 is more detailed, there are some certain quirks that I dislike about 4 (i.e. vanishing traffic).However, like Simcity 3000, Simcity 4 bathes in interaction, immersive sound and introspection. The game is highly polished compared to other recent city builder games (City Life series I'm looking at you), and although lacks a proper 3D engine has a definite charm to it. In short if you've never played city builders, this is your best place to start.			"

There are some excellent mods that better balance the game and add new roads and buildings. This is a very addicting game, and even though it is old, it is still the best.And for you LInux fans, it works very well with Wine.			"

The modding community is one of the most active modding community I have seen since a Bethesda game. Theres no need for city limit extensions either the game comes with a massive border even for litte plots. What I always do is make cities into parts like East and West and they look awesome from the region view. You can edit the land, have military bases next to rocket launches and, and, and...I could go on about this game for days on end it looks like I already have. So just buy it nomatter what price. £9.99 is still too little for this timeless classic.∞/10Would put down 10 Tokyoo Towers again.			"

												Ignore the 0.1 hours spent playing, I've been playing the original retail build since I already had it installed and bought the Steam copy when it was on sale. This applies to the retail build but unless EA quietly made changes before it appeared on Steam, should still apply to the Steam version.Now then, a game thats over 10 years old is still miles better than its 2 year old sucessor. How is this possible you say? No restrictions on city size, more transportation options, never required Internet connection in the first place.  Throw in game altering mods like Colossal Addon Mod and what could be considered an unofficial expansion pack, Network Addon Mod and you have near perfection.Sure its a bit buggy and crash prone and no widescreen support but there's guides on the Internet on using what launch options to fix the widescreen issue and lessen the blow. Only downside is that I don't get a landmark commerating the server failure. SimCity 2013 has that though.			"

												It's now 2014 and this is still the best city building game out there. Sure the graphics are outdated but every other aspect of the game is superior to more modern titles. Despite being old, the graphics are still pretty decent (actually supports HD widescreen, just google it) and you'll find yourself sometimes zooming in to buildings just to admire the details. Although the game is simple to pick up, its deceptively difficult. It takes practice and planning to grow your towns into cities into bustling metropolitans. The mechanics are complex and challenging but also very rewarding to master. I have logged hundreds of hours on this game over the years creating vast multi-city regions.Once you think you've covered all of the game, finally grew some elusive skyscrapers (or whatever your goal is), there is still a plethora of mods available to you. Whether you want real life buildings, fantasy buildings, custom regions (some created using real life data), or advanced networking/traffic capabilities, there is something for everyone. This game is now 10+ years old and there is still custom content being created on nearly a daily basis. What other game has this much longevity?It's by far one of the best simulation games ever made in any genre.			"

												Best city sim ever created. Not without it's problems, dense cities become impossible to manage. If you're going for a city with a population of a million citizens you can do it but no matter how well you plan there will always be too much smog traffic and garbage. There will also be idiots who leave their houses deserted and start a life of crime in the thousands because their commute to work was three hundred miles away for absolutely no reason at all. Seriously if I put a commercial zone next to a house why do it's occupents commute to Holland?Still, this is the best of the series and the series is the best in the world at city building. Simcity 2013 has exactly nothing that this doesn't have except a higher price tag and a deep feeling of regret.			"

												I haven't played the latest Sim City, but I've played all the rest. This is by far, my most favorite version. This gives you all the features that you expect out of a Sim city builder game. You zone land for the three basic types in your city: residential, commercial, and industrial. Each of the three zones has three subcategories. For example, you can pick an agricultural zone for industrial or medium density, which will allow small shops and factories. Same goes for the other core zones. Placement of services is critical in the city. Police stations, fire stations, and hospital proximity to things is all important. But your sims want more than just the essentials. They want soccer fields, plazas, playgrounds, and tennis courts as well. Again, where these units are placed is critical. Each thing you make costs a build amount and a monthly upkeep, so thought must go into it. As does how much road you have and of what type. You can eventually add rail, boats, planes, and a myriad of other additions to the pulse of the city. I have a few gripes with the game though (all minor). One, the camera controls could be smoother. Two, WASD should be the primary camera control instead of the arrow keys (the game shows its age here). And three, I wish the game had more organic choices for laying roads and placement of zones. All things snap to the grid and diaganol roads have a funny bend to them. These have nothing to do with the enjoyment of the game though.Sim City is a relaxed, leisurely game to play.			"

												I've played SimCity Creator and SimCity DS and thought they were pretty good. I've played those games in my childhood and I still play them on occasion for nostaliga. When I came across this ancient relic, I thought ""Wow, what an old game. It must be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.""I thought indeed. After I played the tutorial, I learned that this is much better and more complex than the two SimCitys I have played in the past, and was very suprised to the capabilities it had. The other two had came out almost 6 years after this game had released and are very, and I mean VERY, more primative and basic than this game. About 1 1/2 hours later, I realized that the other two are absolute ♥♥♥♥ing horrible teir, and this one is god teir.So, in my conclusion, I would give this an 7/10 so far. The last two have spoiled me with their easy gameplay and basic understandments. But, with more expirence and gametime with this improved game, I shall hopefully give it a higher score the next time I sit down and review this masterpiece.			"

												Has it really been 14 years since I first played this game? I remember going to Target and getting it the week of release and Wikipedia tells me that was 2003!! There's been a lot of games that I've played and forgotten about in that time but I still come back to play SimCity 4 once in a while.I haven't played the Steam release as much but I used to spend hours upon hours on the disc-based version of the game. However, I still love making experiments with cities and see how they turn out. What would happen if there was no mass transportation in this city? What if there was no education? What if there was only one road? Etc..Slowly and surely after playing city after city I see a huge megalopolis develop with large airports, extensive monorail routes and lots of freeways. This game definitely deserves a nomination for the ""Test of Time"" award. I don't think I currently play any games on Steam older than SimCity 4.			"

												Recommended to new Sim fans.  I remember years ago, playing the original Sim City and many of it's decendants. (Sim City 2, Sim City 3, Sim Chopper, etc) This used to be one of those games you would play for ""just a few more minutes"" - then next thing you know it's 3AM and you have to work the next day. I bought Sim CIty 4 Deluxe with a bit of fond nostalgia,  and soon enough I was looking at familiar yet different screens. In the older versions you had to build water and electric infrastructure, connect power across roads, and make sure you had sufficient plants to take care of all that. This version has a bit of that but it all seemed somewhat... tamer? Anyhow, with the advent of the internet and multi-player gaming I can see how this could be a good way to kill time with some friends, but for a single-player I think the older versions had ""something"" that was a bit more engaging. I read about a bunch of bugs this version is supposed to have, but I didn't run into any yet, so I think Steam did a decent enough job of patching it - or perhaps the bugs just aren't that noticable. The controls were all reponsive and with a bit of practice I learned where all the ""hidden"" menus were tucked away. I just don't think I will be spending that much time on this game, but for the price (under $5) it was worth it to me.			"

												Ignore all of those bad reviews that pop up now and then, they're probably just people who have bad computers/brains. Anyhow, really fun game. Graphics aren't bad, even though they're mainly 2D, they're made to look like 3D. The gameplay is awesome, too. I remember playing this as a kid, I would literally rush for a large city with skyscrapers using landmark towers and stuff. Because at the time, I didnt really know too much about the game, but I kept failing, and kept playing. That's how good the game was. Games like Master of Olympus and Simcity 4 are the reasons why I am playing games today. Without these games in my childhood, I probably wouldn't be sitting here writing a review about it. I recommend to all who want a Simcity with decent graphics and gameplay, on a balance. It's got better graphics than 3000, and better gameplay than Simcity 2013.			"

												A timeless classic of city building. With unmatched tools, situations and problems. It will grab you by your neck and not let you leave your Pc for hours. Rejoice as your town grows into a city, as you place those majestic monuments and as your citizens rally to support you all round. The art style has not dated, even though special commands needed to play in glorious 1080p.			"

												Sim City 4 is still the Gold Standard city building simulation game, 12 years and counting.  This game still is at the top of the throne because of all the customization and modification you're able to make in this game.  With several websites solely dedicated to hosting SC4 mods, you are left with endless possibilities in how you want to design your region and cities.  The only misfortune this game suffers from is that is doesn't have the modern luxuries of new games(enhanced graphics, better hardware support, better core features to name a few), but the modification to this game helps alleviate most of this issues.  While my time on Sim City 4 is limited through Steam, I have certainly put in over 1500+ hours of game play throughout the years, and it remains one of my favorite games of all time(a game that I certainly keep coming back to over time).  If you're into city building games, this is a must for anyones gaming library.  Even after 12 years, every city building game that comes out has the same questions, which is, ""Can this topple SC4 for best city build sim?"".  Each game has failed to dethrone this champion(Cities:Skylines might be the best bet).  With all that said, if you haven't played this game, I highly urge you to make this an addition to your library, you will not be disappointed!			"

												Oh how I was missing this game of my account...After the last SimCity... Mess? I honestly forgot how amazing the previous SimCity games were! I used to play SimCity 3000 UK but I've never played SimCity 4. Although this is a bit dated now, it is still amazing, the landscaping works really well, the roads, tracks, motorways etc work nicely and the buildings and structures are pretty nice models seems this game states it was released in 2003.The graphics are good, Obviously a little dated but... You'd know that, the only thing I wish it had in video settings was 1080p. [ READ BELOW ]-- UPDATE: Thanks to user ""Damon Gant"", you can go to 1080p easily, you need to go into ""Launch Options"" and type / copy & paste ""-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32"". Works brilliantly, Icons are a little small but still clear.One extra little thing I liked was the ability to play as a Sim inside your city... Driving a car, truck, boat, helicopter andplane... This doesn't seem to add anything useful to the game but it's a nice feature to have!Only things I don't like about this game are the fact that bridges can't go diagonal and the building zones can't go diagonal.I think this game is near-perfect, Noticed no bugs, glitches, freezes or crashes. I'd also imagine that majority of people can play this as it isn't a demanding game.This is now my favourite City building game, It was CitiesXL but that game has annoying bugs etc.-- Side note after playing a couple hours. You'll need to save your game every so often, this game does crash.. Probably an issue with Windows 7? No Idea! - This isn't a huge issue aslong as you remember to save!			"

												I absolutely loved this game as a kid. It was a great way to waste time; my grandma and I would play this for hours! But, for some reason playing through Steam is SUPER glitchy. You click on a mission notification, and you can't even read the mission. You can only look at the map at certain angles, or else a huge triagle of glitchy colors and textures cuts through a quarter of your view. The game itself isn't the problem, so if you know and love this game and can look past the issues, then be my guest.			"

												Mac version not recommended.  It was clearly an afterthought and even simple features such as importing heightmaps or custom regions are not supported.  Most mods will not work.Gameplay in general is enjoyable but not as engrossing as I remember classic Sim City being.  U Drive It missions are terrible.  The interface is clunky and slow to respond, and while you're trying to learn how to drive thrings around your city your failed missions cause you to lose money, reputation and sometimes even city features.For the price I can't recommend it.

												Do not buy, steam did something with the game play and now it suffers from random activity shut downs.  By this it means the game just stops building anything, everything just runs in place, buildings half built and people running to dead end streets.Use the old CD versions if you can find it at a five and below.  But avoid anything Sims for steam, just seems that they can't get it to work.			"

												SimCity…The definitive city building game…The time show on steam doesn’t show the amount of time I have spent since I bought the game in 2004. As a matter of fact, I have gone through about 5 copies of this game…SimCity4 has infinite replay value. No 2 cities will be the same…..don’t even attempt to make a duplicate city…it will not work.Simcity4 works a little differently from the previous version of SimCity in that, where the previous versions just gave you a plot of land to build on, SC4 lets you select a region, akin to a city or county in your state. You can import and export among the regions, sell electricity, water and import garbage. Build a police station with a helipad and be a helicopter pilot stopping crimes. Build a hospital with a helipad, and deliver a liver for a transplant. Build a small airfield and  spray crops for insects, or write messages in the sky. Built an airport, and watch the tourism tax dollars start rolling in…			"

												What do I have to say of this game? Sadly, modern day computers have some issues running this... but I can safely say this game had some great childhood memories for me when I had it on a phyiscal copy. I'd say, if you have an older computer that runs on Windows 2000, XP or Vista, definitely run SC4 on this.Even with the complaint of newer computers not running the game very well, I would really recommend playing this since it's the best SimCity game of the series and you will have fun for hours building small towns to huge cities all you imagine. You can even import your small SimCity 4 maps into The Sims 2. Also fun for those who want their custom made maps in there. :3			"

												What do I have to say of this game? Sadly, modern day computers have some issues running this... but I can safely say this game had some great childhood memories for me when I had it on a phyiscal copy. I'd say, if you have an older computer that runs on Windows 2000, XP or Vista, definitely run SC4 on this.Even with the complaint of newer computers not running the game very well, I would really recommend playing this since it's the best SimCity game of the series and you will have fun for hours building small towns to huge cities all you imagine. You can even import your small SimCity 4 maps into The Sims 2. Also fun for those who want their custom made maps in there. :3			"

												Well I got the game because it was on sale. I had been thinking about getting a SimCity game before buying this.I got into the game and quickly realized the game is a LOT more complex then it may seem. It took me quite a bit of time to get a good city running that didn't fail in the first hour of me building. I think it is a fun game if you are ready to think, and demonstrate problem solving skills.Very fun game that  I enjoy very much. I would recommend buying because it gives you countless hours of entertainment.			"

Starting from a small community of a few hundred people and seeing it grow into a megalopolis with millions of residents, with subways, highways, airports, skyscrapers...A masterpiece, highly recommended.

												This is the most elite example of ""Dumbed Down for the Console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.  Simcity 3000 is better.  Simcity 2000 is better!.  By sacraficeing a massive amount of actual customizeability and gutting most of what makes SimCity fun to use, they make a game that is more appealing to causal gamers.  The terrain editor is a joke by not giving you precice control like the editor in Simcity 2000 and the way the zoning system adds in ""Streets"" Guts the actual customizeability and haveing 6 different roads that do the SAME THING is the most useless thing I've ever seen, they switched a pathetic power plant selection to have 10 different mass transit systems you will never NEED because they space the occupy traded by the paltry city size.  And why are there only two options for city size!? the ""Large"" city in this game feels smaller than the max city size in simcity 2000!This is a Terrible game, do not waste your money on it.			"

No stuttering or lagging. This game doesn't have the most fanciest graphics, but you have to remember it was made for Windows XP. The price tag at 19.99 is a little high. We suggest waiting until it is below the 10.00 mark.Out of 10 we give this game an 8. Relaxing, nobody shooting at you. Just a game to waste a few hours on kicked back having a drink.Enjoy.			"

												Straight up classic. Was the premier title in its genre for over a decade until cities skylines came along, but it is still great. My experience with the game is pre steam, and I still have the disk. Base gameplay is reasonably complex with a multitude of options, if some of the simulation is simplified becasuse of the technical limitations of its day. Has a dash of humor for good measure. Reasonable difficulty once you understand how the game works. There are a few technical issues on newer operating systems, but fixes exist if you google for them.OH, almost forgot about the insane amount of mods for this. You can find anything you could possibly want for the game online.			"

It's moddable beyond anything a modern games maker would even consider, letting you change traffic simulation, train, plane and ferry skins, add buildings, add HD textures, alter the way a city needs to grow, you name it. And installation of said mods is child's play, simply downloading files into a plugin folder. And because of it's age the sheer amount of mods out there is insane. The community is still alive and kicking after 11 years, which tells you something about the longevity of this game. If you like city builders then look no further, Maxis set the bar with this one and it has yet to be beaten.			"

It can generally be purchased incredibly cheaply during Steam sales, definitely worth a buy to relive the Sim City nostalgia of old, or for totally new players.			"

												This is IT!This game is the Holy grail of city simulation. You can search for other city sims, but there is none worthy of this one.Sure you have the new ''city sims''. But those are games. Maybe they are playable, maybe they have good graphics, maybe they have a satisfactory sim engine. But nothing beats SC4. Nothing can even compare to the vastness of this beauty! The only reason I got a Steam account is to buy this game again. After you get a hang of it, you will be able to build vast cities. And I don't mean vast simcity 2013 stuffthatisntreallyevenbig, I mean real life vast. You can make a city over an infinite amount of tiles. and the tiles are 4x4km, so that is vast. You can make complex networks of roads, rails, waterways, highways, canals.. bassically anything you can think of. Due to the again VAST online community of modders, who after 10 years still make new and new stuff every day!And when I say that, that means free and for the more organised teams thoroughly coded, tested and fully functional mods, that have changed the game to an extent, that it became unrecognasible. And all that from people that live for this game, not some employees of some big company doing stuff they are dictated to do as quick and buggy as possible.If you like the genre of city simulation. You can not buy a better game. And the amount of money spent on this game, is money well spent!To a 10 more years of Sim City 4!			"

												This game takes a bit of reading and youtube to learn, but, once you get the hang of it, it will bring you many hours of entertainment. Remember resources in other cities can transfer over, so you can make an entire city a landfill! I think that is really fun to do. Since you are god you can also ruin the lives of your citizens by setting fires, tornados, meteors, volcanos, aliens, giant robots, and more! If this game goes $10 or less it is worth the investment.			"

												After more than 10 years, SC4 still holds the best city simulator title. Broad management options, huge maps, zoning tools and infrastructure capabilities allow you to become a true city planner. Combine this with a great soundtrack and you will get a true timesink. Plenty of mods fix some isues the vanilla game has and adds a lot more buildings and building tools. If you want to take care after a city of lovely sims, this is the perfect choice.			"

Two seconds later, ""WE ARE OVER WATERED!!"" So okay I don't know how you over water a person, but ♥♥♥♥ them. Needed more business and homes? I gotchu fam! ""Mayor spanked for spending"". What the hell do you expect from a mayor who only wants to appease you ♥♥♥♥s??? Everything I did, only got shot down within 5 seconds. However, there is a great range of ways to destroy said town.10/10 would destroy again			"

												Well I got the game because it was on sale. I had been thinking about getting a SimCity game before buying this.I got into the game and quickly realized the game is a LOT more complex then it may seem. It took me quite a bit of time to get a good city running that didn't fail in the first hour of me building. I think it is a fun game if you are ready to think, and demonstrate problem solving skills.Very fun game that  I enjoy very much. I would recommend buying because it gives you countless hours of entertainment.			"

												Best city simulation game to date. Forget SimCity 2013, play this instead. It's not easy to learn, but it's very rewarding. Starting from a small community of a few hundred people and seeing it grow into a megalopolis with millions of residents, with subways, highways, airports, skyscrapers...A masterpiece, highly recommended.

												This is the most elite example of ""Dumbed Down for the Console ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥quot;.  Simcity 3000 is better.  Simcity 2000 is better!.  By sacraficeing a massive amount of actual customizeability and gutting most of what makes SimCity fun to use, they make a game that is more appealing to causal gamers.  The terrain editor is a joke by not giving you precice control like the editor in Simcity 2000 and the way the zoning system adds in ""Streets"" Guts the actual customizeability and haveing 6 different roads that do the SAME THING is the most useless thing I've ever seen, they switched a pathetic power plant selection to have 10 different mass transit systems you will never NEED because they space the occupy traded by the paltry city size.  And why are there only two options for city size!? the ""Large"" city in this game feels smaller than the max city size in simcity 2000!This is a Terrible game, do not waste your money on it.			"

												Probably the best city building, management and simulator ever made. Extremely detailed, with lots and lots of well done prerendered graphics (the world, cars and some objects are 3D though, so it doesn't ruin the presentation at all). It's the deepest SimCity, and it's also the hardest: you'll really need to grow your city slowly and watch the taxes, or else you'll be bankrupt in no time. But if you're patient, you'll be rewarded with hours and hours of fun. It's good to be the Mayor!There are some problems though. For example, no widescreen support and flawed transit (both can be fixed by mods). Also the game has some compatibility issues with newer systems and 64 bit Windows, so you'll have to use software mode and put some graphics options on medium and low.Other small flaws are: the driving minigames (you can drive cars, helicopters, planes and even a tank on missions around the city), which are a bit annoying, and can become frustrating due to city traffic and sudden failures. Nowhere near as good as what Streets of SImCity did with SC2000's maps. And the other small problem is that  it tries to mimic the graphic style of The Sims, so most cities will look the same. Still, it's good that they didn't casualize the game to the max back then in 2003, trying to appeal to The Sims audience. Instead, we got the most complex SimCity to date, and I recommend it.			"

												What a city simulator needs to be. No major issues with Steam version, tweaks work what I've tested, even uses Windows Documents folder to seek for plug-ins and stuff. Plenty of support, ideas, mods and what not from various internet sources. Prefers Intel processors though, used to crash regularily on my old AMD dual core way back then.Much recommended, regardless of its age, possibly the only city simulator ever truly worth it.EDIT: Further study revealed that the issue with crashing or sudden abortions of the game was and remains to be mainly use of multi core CPUs, not so much of the make itself. Therefore it's advisable to set the SC4's CPU affinity to single core only which significantly reduces the infamous occurences of game aborting to desktop in a zap. Still, keep saving the game progress frequently, especially before and after all major building or city tweaking sessions. Google for further details on how to set CPU affinity or to modify Steam's game start settings.			"

												A all-time classic in my world and ten years later, still utterly playable.  Recommended to all those with cravings to literally make a perfect world for us all to live.  It's odd though, no matter what I 'tweak' this game runs choppy and seems only fit for CPU's under 2 cores and older school graphic cards (Nvidia 7 series and older), but still works OK-ish.Somehow for me, it works better in software mode (which means my Gfx card isn't used at all) but doesn't look 100%, but a lot more playable.  I guess a single core on my 8 core system works better than a my Gfx cards GPU's and cores.Why have suddenly started playing this again?  SimCity, the (2012) new release has officially been annouced by Maxis and EA... finally after ten years, it's getting it much deserve update.  A game I truly and officially want, now... as well as GTA:5, HL:3 and L4D3 []^_^]			"

												Edited from original. It's a simulator, the fun thing with simulators is you say when you have won or lost. It's something you have to look at a lot and maybe tweak and adjust or tear down and start again. I cannot express this enough, you set your goal in the region you want and work towards it. Or you find a region and see how it develops where you and the residents work together to make something you can both work with and look at for hours and hours. Because it did draw hours and hours trying to see how the game worked, where the balances where. And that was why we played them.Sounds abit shouty, but its how I play and is this is valid to you. I do want you to enjoy this game as much i have as.In a nutshell. It's an old game, I think you need to tweak win10, and maybe some resolution.I play Mac, no issues with 10.10.3 on late 2008 macbook.The rushhour is needed imho to see how commutes work.Communities external to steam still there at Jan 2016.Great to revisit and send a tornado through Bob Newbies back yard.. Bad arm was it Bob?Part of the original.If your rig can't run the all new fancy city builders, or you distrust the 'always on' DRM management style, this is great.10/10 will laugh at children playing city management games again.

												SC Deluxe is the pinnacle of City-Builders to date, offering a complex city simulation and a steep learning curve unlike any other. The game tutorials introduce you to the core mechanics and an overview of how to balance your finances with your cities growth, and then allows you to develop the neighbouring cities into fledgling cities. Once you have accomplished this feat, the game offers various other famous locations to build your metropolises from scratch.Although the game suffers dated graphics, the gameplay is definately not. My only suggestion is that if you do buy Simcity 4 Deluxe, ensure you visit the modding community, who have poured years into the various mods which not only increase city variation, but offer complete rewrites of various features (Such as NAM, a transport network mod which offers unprecedented levels of control of how your city traffic flows, and how it appears)			"

												SimCity 4 is a decent enough SimCity for the current Generation. I say ""Decent"" because It's really hard to recommend a god game that tends to Crash as often as SimCity 4 does, and it doesn't help that the Sims in the game can't seem to drive well. Then again, SimCity 4 doesn't require an Internet Connection to actually play the game or a separate Origin account (Elecronic Arts, be damned!), so I'll still say it's better than it's successor.

												If you havent played a SimCity game by now you probably never will.  I do enjoy them.  They are games that aren't just for people who play video games.  Its interesting to watch your city, you designed, grow.  The only difference in the sequels is mainly the details.  You get more land and has more detailed graphics.  This one lets you connect citys on a much larger map.  I think it even lets you connect to other peoples cities.  I like these games but i dont think this is worth more than 10 bucks.  I never pay much for my games.			"

Connect your city with other cities in your region, trade and let your city grow to a metropole. Of course, it takes time to get all the nice things but it's a nice challenge, with pleasant graphics, relaxing music and some little tasks to improve your reputation.If you like simulations and wish create the city of your dreams, without going to war, Sim City 4 is a classic.

												Time has passed but this game hasn't aged that much. It's a solid fun game, friendly to kids and adults as well, where you cause your own troubles in your city, and for this cutting-edge graphics aren't a priority. Even more than ten years later, the basics for city building games hasn't changed. What excites me most in SimCity 4 is doubtless the Rush Hour, where you can see the traffic in your city and makes you plan your design more carefully, combining different modes of transport and thinking about city population density. Give it a try.			"

												Very classic SimCity game. A graphically and gameplay-wise updated version of the original SimCity2000 style game. Connecting your cities through the regional map is fun and entertaining. Allowing transport and trade between the cities also adds another layer of depth to the game. I can spend hours at a time making new cities, and after all the work it's very satisfying to see a full region. Not much to conplain about, any annoying features of the game (like fires or pipebursts) can be avoided by playing properly.			"

												An Amazing Game got over 212hours 36min in the game in less than 2 months, thats how addicted I am! Although I had some technical issues with the game crashing and refusing to start (which I nedded to delte my saved data to get the game to start) but with some tinkering around with the files and downloading the SC4 launcher it runs. The gameplay is amazing easy to learn hard to master the zoneing, Road networks, services, and teriforming tools work smoothly and intuitive. However, how come the soundtrack is soo good I could listen for hours. If there is one problem with the game it would be the traffic system. Traffic is to much of an issue and it can destroy your city, with buildings be abandoned left right and centre, and the mass transit is hard to manage. Even if I set ordnaces and toll boths to encourage it next to nobody use it! Also another small gripe I have is the railway you have to make the track in certain ways and you can't just do a simple turn like with roads you have to do a weird curve system for it to work  and they are impossible to maage the swichers and stations. It just so frustrating!! for example to make a railway system to function I nedded to demolish around 10 houses and it was really costily, and even after all my work, nobody used it! Sorry those unlucky souls that lost there homes in the great awful railway purge of 2003. And don't get med started on regoinal traffic, Ha Ha Ha Maxis I will end you. Anyway despite these issues it is an extraodinary game and is timeless it puts SimCity 5/2013 to shame! and the traffic issues I mentioned can be solved with mods (which I have installed) but I am judjing this game on its own merits.I give this game a 8/10 (Very Good) "

												Time has passed but this game hasn't aged that much. It's a solid fun game, friendly to kids and adults as well, where you cause your own troubles in your city, and for this cutting-edge graphics aren't a priority. Even more than ten years later, the basics for city building games hasn't changed. What excites me most in SimCity 4 is doubtless the Rush Hour, where you can see the traffic in your city and makes you plan your design more carefully, combining different modes of transport and thinking about city population density. Give it a try.			"

												Very classic SimCity game. A graphically and gameplay-wise updated version of the original SimCity2000 style game. Connecting your cities through the regional map is fun and entertaining. Allowing transport and trade between the cities also adds another layer of depth to the game. I can spend hours at a time making new cities, and after all the work it's very satisfying to see a full region. Not much to conplain about, any annoying features of the game (like fires or pipebursts) can be avoided by playing properly.			"

												An Amazing Game got over 212hours 36min in the game in less than 2 months, thats how addicted I am! Although I had some technical issues with the game crashing and refusing to start (which I nedded to delte my saved data to get the game to start) but with some tinkering around with the files and downloading the SC4 launcher it runs. The gameplay is amazing easy to learn hard to master the zoneing, Road networks, services, and teriforming tools work smoothly and intuitive. However, how come the soundtrack is soo good I could listen for hours. If there is one problem with the game it would be the traffic system. Traffic is to much of an issue and it can destroy your city, with buildings be abandoned left right and centre, and the mass transit is hard to manage. Even if I set ordnaces and toll boths to encourage it next to nobody use it! Also another small gripe I have is the railway you have to make the track in certain ways and you can't just do a simple turn like with roads you have to do a weird curve system for it to work  and they are impossible to maage the swichers and stations. It just so frustrating!! for example to make a railway system to function I nedded to demolish around 10 houses and it was really costily, and even after all my work, nobody used it! Sorry those unlucky souls that lost there homes in the great awful railway purge of 2003. And don't get med started on regoinal traffic, Ha Ha Ha Maxis I will end you. Anyway despite these issues it is an extraodinary game and is timeless it puts SimCity 5/2013 to shame! and the traffic issues I mentioned can be solved with mods (which I have installed) but I am judjing this game on its own merits.I give this game a 8/10 (Very Good) "

												This game is wonderful. It sadly, however, wont work on my new computer. Anyway, it is wonderful because you can create a city and you have COMPLETE POWER! There is NO democracy, literally. It's like you've got a dictatorship city. The only thing stopping you from having the Sphinx as your first building is money. Money is required for everything. You have a limited supply, but you can get more by doing various things. This adds challenge to the game. Overall, it is just WONDERFULL!!			"

												One of the best games I've ever played, so much fun.Btw. some people tell you you have to mod it like shity skylines to make it playable and fun but to be honest all you need are two more hospitals and you are good to go. Also since you have the deluce version which has the rushhour addoon in it you can play it with smaller cpus if I remember correctly. Because the original version if you had a lack of cpu power it would let the whole trafic flow over one route which is just anoying. But who still has such a smal cpu? Also you should write special start conditions in the header of this file, just google it and you know what I mean, to play it in HD. You can also play it in 4K but except that the menus are rediclius smal your pc will not make it. Seriously everything is rendered with the CPU, it is an old game. You need a 500€ cpu and you might be able to do that.Anyway let's cut the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I could rant over so much about this game the whole time but seriously just play this game if you look for a serious chalange. Actually you can outmaneuver the game and just make a big city without anything but hightech industry, no smoke yeaaah!.^^ But if you want it more easy play shity skylinies or shities xxl.If you are not familier with the simcity serious I am telling you play 3000 first, but where to get it, and where is an installer for modern PCs? I was able to install it back with win7 but win10 doesn't work and it has allot of problem which is sad because simcity 3000 is one of the cutest and funniest city builder which you still can consider serious.So play simcity 2000 instead and when you are back and just outplayed this game (*cough* just crank the taxes up to 8 *cough*) and than come back and play this one, it can be tough as nails but after a 100 hours you have a natural flow and just do it without thinking about it. Yeah I gues I am one of the few ones who may plaed 1000hours of this game but that was way back in the 00th years. But I can guarantee you 100 hours of fun.And I want to mentioned I loved this game even we where a little disapointed that it wasn't full 3D.			"

												The SimCity series is well known as a city and urban planning simulator and this iteration  is no different. This version brings some nice little touches to the franchise like a night/day cycle and a land terraforming mode too. Overall while this title is pretty old it is still a fun game. A game in which you can learn all the ins-n-outs of how to build, run and, manage a city successfully.			"

												Nothing like build a multimillion person metropolis and the gettoizing it ah la Detroit.  Too bad is it rather buggy on 64-bit systems otherwise I'd never leave my cities alone.  I've played dozens of city builders, but none are as good as this decade old unforgiving masterpiece.Note: Skip Sim City 5 and stay with this if you like to create spawl.  If you can't get this to work try Cites XL, which is a decent single city builder.			"

It might be difficult to some, but that's the fun in it. After all your hardwork, you can watch your beautiful city growand thrive. There is not better feeling than that.Seriously, this is the BEST city builder.			"

												The first few cities you build can be fun, but it gets old real fast with the lack of scenarios, objectives, or other features to make each time you play more unique.The game makes abandoned buildings occur so frequently all the time, not matter how much you address the issues that caused them to be abandoned. As well, once you start a city in a tile, it is almost impossible to do any landscapring becuase of how small and slow the landscaping tools are. If it is on some sort of blowout sale, it's worth a play, but definitely do not pay full price for this game.			"

												I really enjoyed playing this game.  But I found it insulting that no matter how big I built my city, dangerous minorities never came in to destroy it.  It gave you the power to cause earthquakes and other natural disasters.  You could even unleash a giant robot to destroy your city.. But not one single act of gang violence throughout the entire game.  Get your act together EA.   If I take the time to build an enormous city.. I want to be rewarded with realism.  We want crips and bloods.			"

												While I always enjoyed the CD version of this game since its release - other than the lack of game patches to correct the metropolis city crashing I had, I really can't get into the Steam version of the game.Why you may ask? Because for some reason, ever since I first purchased this game on Steam, I keep having graphical glitches that make the game pretty much unplayable. The visuals glitch out and don't show me where roads and buildings are, and I have to constantly move the camera around or zoom in/out to try and correct it... and it happens every time I place a building.I have no idea how to correct this issue with my version of the game... as I've tried uninstalling and starting from scratch, etc. It's frustrating because this is a good game - if only I weren't having these issues.

												After a 20 year break, I figured this summer it would be a good time to get back into the SimCIty franchise with 2003's SimCity 4.This is one of those games where its greatest strength happens to also be its greatest weakness. The game is incredibly deep, which to a SimCity enthusiast must be the ultimate dream. For entry level players it is however a substantial barrier to entry. There is a tutorial, although I felt it could have been a little more in depth beyond the basics it does go over.But once you are rolling, you are in command of all the tools you'll ever need to run your city. If you're like me, you'll become attached to your city as its very own life-form, and will want to nurture it along in its development. And since this is an 8 year old title, it was a nice surprise to have a game today that isn't innundated with achievements and ceaseless updates.SimCity 4 is a winner, I'm glad I made the trip back im gaming time to play it.

												Simcity 4 isn't really fun or even playable without Morrowind levels of modding. The problem is that the people who make mods for this game are lowlife nerdy bungholes who care about copyrights for their stupid, kilobyte sized mods, and as a result deliver the mods in needlessly segmented packages with dependency files to keep track of etc, which is a pain in the nads. I hope some Russian website steals all of their precious creations, slabs cyrillic characters all over their names and releases all of it for easy download one day.Once you get past all that it's easily the best Simcity game, next to the one for SNES. You can build whatever you want, make it look gorgeous and there's no unnecessary agent system or whatever. Just p0rn. No bul1sh!t.			"

												11 years on I'm still playing. Ny hours don't reflect thousands of hours played before joining Steam. LOTS of great content at Simtropolis. The king of city builders, Works fine on Vista/WIN 7 32/64 bit. You don't need a killer video card but a quad core and lots of memory keeps it from getting bogged down as the cities grow. Anyone who claims this game sucks has no clue to how it's played. To be STILL offered on Steam after a decade says a lot about the quality of the original Maxis team. 100/100			"

												Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition. You may ask isn't the newest Sim City the best? The answer by many people is no. Sim City 4 Deluxe Edition (SC4DE) does not require internet for easier play, has very cool features added with Rush Hour including U-Drive It Mode. This is a great game for anybody who like city builders as it is the best game in the series of Sim City! I highly reccomend paying $19.99 for this great quality game. So go on, buy it for yourself and play for hours on end. I know you want to...			"

												Low Frame Rates- My computer can run games like Half-Life 2 and Tropico 5 no problem, this game however (even with being a game from 2004) can't get above 4 frames-per-second.Broken Engine - You need to save every minute due to the fact that it will *inevitably* crash and erase all your work since you last saved.Broken Funding- The funding mechanics are prone to braking. For instance I have had tens of cities in which hospitals, schools etc, ask for more funding, even though the funding was as high as I could possibly set it.For a tenner it's a pretty decent game which has brought me hundreds of hours of time wasting fun, however it's too broken and buggy to recomend to anyone I'm afraid.

												I downloaded the game and tried to run it off my MSIGS60 Ghost with Windows 8.1- does not work! After about an hour's play, it crashes without explanation. Usually by then the graphics have started to go as well (large patches of single color when zooming in or out- especially out.) Every few weeks I pick up the game, play it until it crashes, and call it a day. Not worth the purchase.			"

												Will not work on Windows 8, and EA the shadiest game developers on the planet will not fix it.  Although a great game before EA started offering steamy piles of unfinished sh*t that you have to pay more for to get more ridiculously overpriced DLC, it connections with EA make it a buyer beware type game.

												This game was released in 2003. It is unstable in Windows 10. The settings menu do not include the option to set the resolution to 1080.To get the resolution to 1080 you have to use this command in launch options (Thanks lesnoobz):-CustomResolution:enabled -r1920x1080x32 -fThe game itself is not so bad if you manage to make it playable, but it is likely you will still get bored after a few hours.

So if you have a Masters in Management go ahead buy this game and waste $20 you could spend elsewhere.			"

												Why do I feel like this game slaps me silly for trying to build a city the way I want rather than their railroaded formula? What fun is it playing the same exact city over and over again? I want there to be a police station right off the bat... nope costs too much.... and the game literally tells you NOT to build a fire station until you have your first fire. By that logic, it makes sense build and raze them after each emergency.The driving mini game is horrible. Cars vanish and appear while your driving making cars you were going to crash into vanish while the opening you did have is now magically occupied.I have tried playing this game. I have forced myself to play it telling myself it'd get better but it hasn't. Honestly if I was offered my money back for it. I'd take it. The only reason why I bought this game was because I loved SimCity2000 as a child (which is no longer compatible with windows no matter how hard I try). I hoped to reclaim the joy of my childhood. Instead I listen to a bunch of sims all screaming about how badly I'm doing OR I finally get the balence right and make a meager $200.00 a month.			"

												It is genuinely impressive how terrible this game is. The problem is, this review isn't based on gameplay. This is because the game is so broken that I can't reach actual gameplay. The little that I managed to play before the game went completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ was promising. It was actually kinda fun. When I created my first power plant, the graphics went completely wonky. The graphics system (I don't exactly know what, I don't completely understand graphics) essentially crashed. Funky shapes appeared all over the screen. I restarted the game, even reinstalled it, but it was still the same. If you want a city-builder, I recommend playing one that isn't complete♥♥♥♥♥♥ like Cities: Skylines or Banished.			"

												I previously played a game of sim city on my old sony ericsson phone years ago and thought it was a lot of fun, it was click and point with good graphics arguably better than this game. Furthermore the gameplay seemed easy to use for someone who is not too computer savvy and who does not want to get to much into detail in games. This game is too high in detail for me, and as such reduces the fun, it seemed at times a real chore to make the books balance. Further too this the games graphics are all over the place, I have read this is because of my modern computer, the solutions offered as well are too complicated for someone who knows little about computers. If like me you know little about computers, I would avoid this game, especially if you are using a modern computer. I am now going to investigate if there is a sim city that can be bought that is similar to the phone version I had, much more user friendly.			"

												Crashes all the time. Completely not adapted for modern operating systems and therefore a complete waste of money unless you plan to run it in a virtual machine. Don't bother. It's barely better than the original SNES version, you might as well play that in an emulator for free and then at least you won't experience constant errors.[Edit] Apparently this review isn't helpful according to 10 people. Not sure what it is they were hoping to learn - it's SIM CITY. The game concept has been the same for 28 years, and this is probably the worst executed instance of it.			"

												Unintuitive, clunky, poor interface, boring, lack of personality, just plain not fun. Any one of these things would spell the death knoll for a game, but SimCity nails them all. To make matters even worse, it doesn't like windows 7 or 8, and will fight you to the death on anything past XP. And it will win.See, the sad part here is I actually *LIKE* city-builder games. Tycoon series? Pretty good! Tropico 4? Awesome! SimCity 1? Win. Afterlife? Epix Win. Sim City 4? Eh... mediocre at best?So what went wrong? How did SC4 fail it up so badly?I think the biggest problem was they lost sight of what made sim city games fun... the city building and the balancing of economy against people's desires. These things all exist in Sim City, and they've been inflated to a status of excessive grandeur, but that may be where the problem is: too much of a good thing.Yes, there's lots of buildings, tons of them in fact... but it mostly just turns into a bogged down mess of junk to sort through if you want to have even a minimally running city at all. Instead of having a reasonable juggling act of a few major things your people need to be happy, tempered by a limited economy, Sim City 4 just throws all caution to the wind and piles on heaps of useless busywork. It's not even interesting construction; a good chunk of it's underground where you'll never even see it anyway. It's just there to waste money and make building the city more ""realistic"" but less interesting.If I wanted ""real"" I wouldn't be playing a game.Tropico 4... is a nice balance. It tosses the balls at you one at a time, slowly ramping up the difficulty and keeping the game entertaining and interesting the whole way. Sim City 4 piles too much needless crap on all at once that provides a remarkably harsh learning curve, for a minimal reward at the end.Sim games have typically struck a wonderful balance in the past between the work and reward aspects, and gave you the tools needed to quickly and efficiently manage your little slice of heaven (or both heaven and hell if playing afterlife =P ). SC4 just kinda drops the ball (to maintain the juggling metaphor from the previous paragraph) by giving slow, irritating, clunky tools which technically ""get the job done"", but are a pain to use and not very fun.Toss in the severe glitches, and absolute, seething hatred SC4 has for pretty much anything above WinXP, and you may as well not even bother considering it. There's simply better games out there... Cities XL for the obsessive compulsive ""realistic"" city builder, Tropico 4 for those who want a great storyline and awesome gameplay with proper balance of being ""just right"" a la goldilocks... and afterlife or sim city classic if you're nostalgic.Final Verdict:SC4 really just doesn't have a place in the city builder market. Anything it does, other games do better. Much, much better. Game-breaking glitches don't help it's argument, either.Overall Score: About 40%. If you can get it to run, it's not really BAD... it's just not particularly good, and you can do better for lower cost, anyway. The music's pretty epic, though.			"

												             This game used to be very fun to play even on low end computers, and I have only recently found the perfect most quickest way to build a very large city at a fast pace (without the cheats). Yet after two occurences already I have found SimCity 4 lacks a very useful tool that most games actually have and is very useful for those ""on a roll"" so to speak and has little time to think about 'saving' the f'ing game this ""tool"" is known to many as, bear with me now, AUTO-SAVE. What?! How?! Oh My God?! Yes I know what your thinking, and I know this will never be implemented into this 12 year old game so i've given up.              Since SC4 dislikes the player actually doing good in a game and/or working hard while having fun making the best god damn city man has ever seen! i.e. SimCity 4 says: BEGONE UNHOLY CREATURE FOR YOU HAVE, uh... CORRUPTED THIS LAND WITH YOUR FILTHY HARMONIOUS AND HIGHLY EFFICIENT CITY WITH A GREAT MANY THOUSANDS OF INHABITANTS THAT YOU HAVE WORKED ON FOR NEARLY 3 HOURS! screw it ill just be a♥♥♥♥♥♥and crash now....again.""Just like that every time i get to a certain point. Unfortunately that pisses me off and so I now hate this game because I have wasted 3+ hours twice now and to me that is VERY valuable. Thus ♥♥♥♥ you S C 4! I mean Thank you for reading.			"

												This game will be out dated by the time you get a display that uses 16:9 aspect ratio, which for most people was 7 years ago.You can only build roads at 90 and 45 degrees, and only straight roads, so that significantly limits what you can do with a city.You don't really get to choose what types of businesses you want... only the zone type.  This is done to make the game linear... start as a poor farm town, upgrade to a suburb, upgrade to a city.I just couldn't get into it.  I kept wanting to micro manage the details of the city, and the game just isn't designed for that.			"

												I can't believe how many people gave this game positive reviews.  It looks NOTHING LIKE the game depicted in the images.  The graphics are halfway to terrible, and the usability is in the toilet.  I messed with it for two hours, and finally decided it just couldn't be worth it.  I spent twenty minutes trying to make a highway, and none of the pieces would connect, no matter what I did about on-ramps and ground-this and clover-leafs-that.  I even went through half of the tutorials before I played.  Worse than this is how often you build an area that builds itself streets that aren't connected to existing streets or builds plots that can't access a road.  And can you just bulldoze them?  No.  I also wasted fifteen minutes trying to make the land appropriate for a beach—seriously?  Why not have the beach auto-teraform if you're going to make it so picky?  Add in the screaming idiot always calling to you to try his stupid roadway adventure (i.e., boring arrow-tapping exercise), and you have an intolerable game.  I'm so disappointed.Who wrote these other reviews?  Everyone made it sound like we finally had a proper Sim City game again.  I hate to say it, but we just don't.			"

But it only works a little. Buy this game with caution. This game does not like duel core computers.			"

												What a dreadful let down. OK, I'm only ten years too late to this game, but I remember the good old days, OK? I thought I'd do some catching up.The region view is a waste of time. Literally. You can't do anything there, and your cities don't talk to one another once they are up and running. There's even still a graphical glitch on some cards.Get into the game and you are plagued by constant pop ups, to the point where you cannot concentrate on being a mayor for ordering fire engines to put out fires. The minute you start placeing government buildings like schools all your staff start striking.The easiest way to progress and have a working city is to use lots of low density zones, power them with wind and water them with towers, have no agriculture, no public buildings, no transport or utilities. Your scumbag city will sit there and generate a nice wee income and you can tinker at the edges.But try and build a thriving metropolis and be prepared to be bothered out of your wits by endless advisors.For a slice of old school Sim City try the iPad version. Much better.			"

												I used to love SimCity. I used to play it a lot on a Mac. I would still love to play it. But not this releaes, not this version. The tools and interface are clunky in the best situation. That's the nicest thing I can say about it. Here's this great game, but you ... just ... can't ... quite ... access it. The interface has a mind of its own, which bears little resemblance to what you want to do (let alone any kind of reality-sim). For example, why, on a completely flat and empty plain, can a cloverleaf only be placed at a 45 degree angle to the grid? Why can't I decide for myself how I want to place it?You end up building a highway, destroy it, build it again .... and so on until you get something vaguley like what you were after. Or your budget runs out.There it is, just out of reach, the fun game I used to play. It is an exercise in extreme frustration. I am going to delete this game and hope I can erase it from my memory.

All that crap that countries and cities IRL worry aobut have come to a game. Never in my life would i think that running a city would be like running a country. Boring and just full of lame stuff like federal spending and such.

												It is a great game, but it keeps freezing even on the lowest graphics, and I have a good computer that can run much larger and more graphic demanding games. I can play it for 10-15 minutes before it freezes, then the computer needs to be turned off and back on again. Major problem with the game, needs a massive bug update.			"

												This game is really fun and reallistic but I wish that it wouldn't have all those weird glitchy marks (or whatever they're called). I don't know if this is a game bug or if it's just my computer, but I'm asking you to look into it. Please?Review update: This game is way too hard even in easy mode! People just won't move in to my residential areas, and it's not very user friendly, and therer's barely any ways to make money! If you fixed this stuff,and also added in the new features that you can get from the game on the games website, then this game would be the best! Please!!! Then I will recommend it and rate it **********************************************************************************************!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!			"

												Well its an old game now but what makes it truly obselete and any game that follows this pattern of city building simulator is its style of civic engineering is obselete. Theres a better way to build cities of the future now built in layers with residental ontop and commercial at the bottom and no roads or cars for local transport. Google The Venus project and you will see what I mean. Still if you want to expierence just the management side of things this game still offers you the capatalistic approach. Also becomming obselete. Just check your pay packet and workers rights for confirmation on that.			"

												This game was a mistake...  They have changed sim city so much that I don't ever want to play it again.  Instead of getting some land and building your city from scratch you get this tiny little peice of land that is barely big enough to make a small town. So you can build on other plots of land that are there adjacent to the one your working on, each smaller then the next. They don't add to your first city they are considered their own cities......   \Absolutly awful, Sim city clearly isn't even trying anymore!			"

												This game is Mr. Turtle approved.A classic city builder, indepth but not boring or hard to grasp in the least.You have disasters which you can control, the game only generates fires as its natural disasters leaving it all up to you to level the city.You have three zones Residential, Commercial, and Industrial. There is argriculture but that's just another industrial zone.So you can make a little farming community if you wish. Or a bustling metropolis.You manage water, electricity, and trash.You may trade with a neighbor in the region.However all the cities in the region are built by you.You can generate simple regions and edit the terrain via each section of the entire map. So click a tile, load in, mess with the terrain if you please and then you get down to business and enter Mayor mode.Gone are your god-like powers... sure.... It's a fun game and a must have for those who like to build cities.  "

I had alot of fun with this game by using a rough multiplayer setup with a friend using a dropbox account.There is no official support through this game. You'll have to get help from the community.I really wish I could buy a Simcity 4.5 that would fix some of the lame issues the game has struggled with since its beginning. But ten years later and no sequel probably means this is the end for this city simulator. Enjoy it while you can.			"

												To all residents of BCIVille:It has come to my attention that a number of you have filed complaints regarding increasing numbers of traffic collisions, crimes and pollution. Rest assured, as mayor I am hard at work on a plan to solve all of our great city's problems at the same time. I cannot say too much right now as it's still in the planning phase, but the general idea of the BCIVille Renewal Project '14 includes an aggressive strategy of tax breaks, industry subsidies and strategic nuclear strikes in the worst areas of the city. As well I'm considering the possibility of using new, exotic materials to simplify our existing infrastructure in order to save our public works departments millions of dollars per year in materials compared to what we've been doing until now. I've discussed the effectiveness of this plan with my advisors and a number of constituents and they all agree: this will work. According to official reports from the BCIVille Department of Quite Reliable Statistics, we should expect to see a 58% increase in cromulence by the year 2016.I understand some of you may have questions or concerns, and believe me, I need your input as citizens to perfect BCIVille for all of us. If you want to volunteer, please address your opinions to the following mailing address, located conveniently next to our city's landfill:BCIVille Municipal Feedback Department4200 West Accidental Ave. Building 4APO Box 810BCIVille, SimNation 66986Thank you for your attention.Sincerely,Office of Most Honorable Mayor arbayer2BCIVille City Hall			"

No, the game just sucks you in so much into managing your town, keeping up on money, trying to get those skyscrapers going, making sure your roads don't suck, that you may overlook some of the stuff because of how much fun you are having making your town EFFICIENT. You know you can do better than your current towns crumbling economy? Prove it! You think having a military contract will help? SCREW YOU BUDDY CRIMERATE IS UP FROM HAVING MILITARY DO WHAT THEY WANT THE DON'T NEED NO MAN. Take it slow, watch what you pay people, keep it in the green and keep developing and moving on education because if you stop too soon, your maintenance gets costly, you'll start running into that red, and one last tip, make sure you have a good amount of water, old buildings burn fast!

The amount of gameplay you can experience is amazing, and you can expand your game so much with mods made by communities til this day! I have played this game for over 400 hours, which is cool and kind of scary at the same time. I'd call myself a SimCity veteran even though I'm just 17.Besides all of that, this game is worth every penny and has the best replay value of all the games in my library.

												It's 99% fantastic on my Win7 PC, ramps up at a good pace, classic play, just enough 'simulation' to make me believe I'm controlling hundreds of thousands of little folks and getting them to build bigger and better buildings, and that the parks I place around town really do suck up the pollution nearby.There's an occasional freeze/bug where I have to fire up Task Manager and put it in its place, but this very rare, and virtually never for a city I've had going for a while.  An acceptable level of downtime for something I keep running alongside while I do my work.If you find it on a holiday sale for, oh, $4.99, I'd say I've gotten more enjoyment out of this than a venti mocha from that one infamous green and white coffee shop franchise.  I'd for sure recommend this to any one who got burned by SimCity5 :)			"

												Although I love the game, the Mac version of this does not seem to contain the latest Maxis-released updates to the Rush Hour expansion. This version still has various bugs. Although, it's wonderful to have a game at all, and one that doesn't rely on the Mac App Store's restrictions. Please update the game to the latest version and allow for the NAM!			"

												i started my city, called it Mickville. The city quickly rose above any other before. the evolution of the city was insane. the citizens wealthy, healthy and all with jobs and the scurge which would promote crime was all but wiped out. for years the city worked in good sucession, the city grew bigger and bigger. the community with it.but... school and health funding was expensive. costs of these things meant that the reserve of money slowly diminished. Jobs were lost and a new breed of crime had begun, the crime started to take over more and more of the city day by day. the police force made a hasty effort to stop the crive wave which was submerging the city, drugs became a big part of the economy, it was the only way for people to make and money, and for some the only way to survive. the crime was that bad that parts of the city least effects were sanctioned off to the rest. this was the last hope for the life of the city. but... this was no end, for what was to come..... the city wouldnt be prepared...... the buildings fall everywere as roiting and violence swept the city. countless adults and even children were majorly injurded and murderd by the crime uprising throughout the city. as the citys police forces efforts were no use.... it was to late for the city..... it all ended with the push of a putton... the bomb dropped killing more and more of the inocent.... killing those which turned agaisnt there city.... there home...... all which has been done was done at a required cost...... Those lost will be rememberd			"

												This game is Mr. Turtle approved.A classic city builder, indepth but not boring or hard to grasp in the least.You have disasters which you can control, the game only generates fires as its natural disasters leaving it all up to you to level the city.You have three zones Residential, Commercial, and Industrial. There is argriculture but that's just another industrial zone.So you can make a little farming community if you wish. Or a bustling metropolis.You manage water, electricity, and trash.You may trade with a neighbor in the region.However all the cities in the region are built by you.You can generate simple regions and edit the terrain via each section of the entire map. So click a tile, load in, mess with the terrain if you please and then you get down to business and enter Mayor mode.Gone are your god-like powers... sure.... It's a fun game and a must have for those who like to build cities.  "

												SimCity 4 is a fun game.  If you played simcity2000 this is the perfect successor to that game.  Pipes are simplified, water is easy and plentiful.  Power is generally easy to manage as are most the cities systems.  I didn't HAVE to cheat to win this game or even to play it the way I wanted to.  The cities seem to adapt better no matter how poorly you place zones.  I love this game.However....  Numerous crash issues, memory leak issues, Huge cities seem to bog down the game in ways you wouldn't expect.  (water being there then not there then there in pipes, leading to rallies about not having water then they do) My pc is far an away powerful enough to run this game, a beast machine when this game was made new. Still this game does not always work.  I would say this game is worth playing, toying around with despite it's many bad programming faults. Just be aware and save often.			"

												SimCity 4, the last Maxis SimCity, remains the best of its genre to this day. Although it lacks the speculative technology of SimCity 2000 or the beautiful slit-scan rendering of the (perhaps unfairly infamous) 2013 revision, SC4 is thorough and rigorous in its realism and level of simulated detail. For example, to check the operation of the simulation at the individual level, you can create and follow sims (and their dynasties) as they travel around from home to work and back, finding jobs appropriate to their social class/level of education, to test your city's transportation grid down to the individual level of detail.This Deluxe Edition comes with the Rush Hour expansion which adds even more detail and control options to transportation simulation. The only significant drawback is that, like previous SimCities, roads cannot truly bend or angle properly; cities consequently must be laid out more or less in a grid pattern. Of course, as Atlanta just demonstrated in Half-Inchopocalypse 2014, there are excellent reasons to avoid curving and angling roads all over the place in city planning, so this is a ""feature"" that you most likely won't miss.

												If you like these kind of games (strategy, economy, building the entire city, even the transports), you are late, GET THIS GAME NOW!!!IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME. -Hundreds of hours of play!-It can even run on a netbook (you can hack the resolution, google it), and it doesn't lag!-Good replayability!-The graphics aged really well, i think they still look pretty much perfect, they don't have to be better. (i don't care about graphics in fact, but in this case, even if i cared, it aged well!)-Thousands of mods and buildings that you can download, so these can make your games longer, better and more replayable!-The possibilities are huge, you could make a city in the desert, in the mountains, whatever biome, and if you don't like it, you can modify the land in any way you want.-The driving missions are sometimes hard, but it's awesome to drive in your own city, the roads you made. And it also reflects the traffic load in your city.-The transports! There's almost anything: planes, trains, ferry, and more. And each one has its missions, and loads of vehicles.So yeah, i'm forgetting stuff. I love this game, i played it even more on my pirated version, but i finally bought it, it is totally worth it, and you can trust a stranger for once ;)			"

												I got a bug for this series since playing Sim City on the SNES way back. Then again, maybe it wasn't a bug as I never played any of the games apart from the SNES version and this, but I trusted the general angle of the reviews.In short, a great game that's ages superbly. You can really soak up the hours once you get a city going and you have massive control. The 'tutorial' cities give you breathing room and you're bound to learn from your mistakes quickly when you get caught in the traps of over/under development of certain of your cities' aspects.I'm quite rubbish at the game, but that doesn't stop it being one of the most absorbing games I've ever played (in that sense, I'd put it there with the likes of Morrowind, Zelda, FFVII, Shenmue - games that utterly took hold of me!)

Still the city simulator after a decadeFirst, this is a really complex game, similar to how running an actual city is really complex. If you don't like managing a lot of detail, then this game isn't for you. There are a lot of zones, utilities, civic structures, and transportation systems to build. It's a bit overwhelming at first, so make sure to go through the tutorials and start small (e.g., low-density zones, no education system, no hospitals, and no water system). While the complexity makes it a bit hard to get into SC4, it's the same thing that's missing in SimCity Societies and SimCity (2013).Second, unless you're playing on a Mac which gets the updated port by Aspyr, you'll have some technical problems to deal with. Basically, you have to add command line parameters to tell the game to use only one of your CPU's cores and to use resolutions that didn't exist when SC4 was released (like 1920x1080). Search the forums for details on recommended parameters. Once you've gotten that figured out, you might want to fiddle a bit with the graphics options (I think I reduced the shading/shadow effects to minimum). With this sorted out, the game runs pretty smoothly for me and only crashes every few hours on average. Save often to be safe. I have no idea if Aspyr's planning to release a Windows version of their Mac version, but when/if they do, these technical problems should pretty much disappear.Third, there are some issues with game mechanics that make it hard to build big regions without mods. While you can do a lot without adding mods, I strongly recommend using the Network Addon Mod (NAM) and Colossus Addon Mod (CAM), at least after you reach the point where things stop working correctly. Even if you don't enable any of the NAM's custom transportation systems, it's worth it for the improved traffic simulator alone. There are lots of mods for fixing other things and adding pretty much everything, so use your favorite search engine and explore. There's still a really active modding community after a decade.Overall, SimCity 4 is a great game once you put in the time to learn it and work around the technical issues. It has what's missing in the newer SimCity games and doesn't force you to be constantly online. It would be really awesome if Aspyr ports their Mac port to Windows (and Linux!), fixing all the technical issues. Until then, I recommend waiting for this game to go on sale before buying it here. I got it for $5 in early 2014 to replace my CD copy that finally broke.			"

												It has been a long time since I wanted to get a SimCity game past Classic, so when I saw SimCity 2013. I got it. Too many problems, so I returned it. Then I saw this one on Steam, so I got it, hoping that it'd at least be able to run smoothly. I was not disappointed.To me, it took a while to adjust to the new things that needed to be managed (like supplying water and spamming the city with parks and trees and etc.) compared to SimCity Classic. Now, I can say that I'm doing a decent job running a city.Lots of thinking and planning is involved to make a good city. It takes some time to get to that but it's rewarding once you're there. Some of the guides found online can help a lot.One of the only things that I dislike about this game is the U-Drive it mode. I've had instances where cars would spawn where I'm at and automatically wreck the car I'm driving. There are other times where I'd drive adjacent to the edge/border of the city, and the game would think that I ""left"" the city and fail me. Other than that, everything else about the game is pretty solid.At the end, I'm happy to say that I'm happy with this buy. :D If you get it, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!			"

												If you like these kind of games (strategy, economy, building the entire city, even the transports), you are late, GET THIS GAME NOW!!!IT'S ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME. -Hundreds of hours of play!-It can even run on a netbook (you can hack the resolution, google it), and it doesn't lag!-Good replayability!-The graphics aged really well, i think they still look pretty much perfect, they don't have to be better. (i don't care about graphics in fact, but in this case, even if i cared, it aged well!)-Thousands of mods and buildings that you can download, so these can make your games longer, better and more replayable!-The possibilities are huge, you could make a city in the desert, in the mountains, whatever biome, and if you don't like it, you can modify the land in any way you want.-The driving missions are sometimes hard, but it's awesome to drive in your own city, the roads you made. And it also reflects the traffic load in your city.-The transports! There's almost anything: planes, trains, ferry, and more. And each one has its missions, and loads of vehicles.So yeah, i'm forgetting stuff. I love this game, i played it even more on my pirated version, but i finally bought it, it is totally worth it, and you can trust a stranger for once ;)			"

I enjoyed many hours of fun and wanted to see how my Monster gaming computer would handle it. I was really bumded when it kept crashing my computer before I could create a city. Or region. Froze it up several times. Then I found out through forums that SimCity Deluxe can't be played on a computer that has AMD video cards or Crossfired cards.Wish I had found this out BEFORE i purchased and downloaded it. There should be a disclaimer that tells us when games won't work on our computers. So I got a refund. Too bad. I really liked SimCity.			"

												How many hours, no, days of my life have not gone into this game? I don't know, but it was a lot. SimCity 4 still is the best city planning simulator ever made. It strikes just the right balance between (micro) management and sheer fun. Most remarkable about the game is that it has this great flow: at times soothing and calm, then frantic and stressing. The jazzy/atmospheric music and the pastel colours all help in creating this atmospheric sense of timelessness and universality as you are working on your city. The soundscape of cars, planes, animals, accidents all help in letting your city come to life. Of course there are faults to be found and after hundreds of hours of gameplay the game's options and diversity have been all but exhausted. City building will then no longer provide a challenge, even on hard mode. But these points are just nitpicking because there was so much fun to be had. So much wonderful creations to be engineered. SimCity 4 is a great game that I still recommend anyone to play.			"

												Running low on funds to run your city?  You can do missions for the good guys or the bad guys and everything will be fine...or will it?   Go from building the city to playing one of the citizens real quick and back again.  But don't mess up too often or it could bankrupt the whole town.Has some bugs and is real old tech.  Still it is lots of fun.Simcity online should have been more like this game.Oh and another thing....the theme music for this game is Legendary.....boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom....etc....this music makes everyone instantly cooler just for listening.Oh and one more thing....you can actually connect your cities with actual roads and they benefit from the traffic and....well you gotta see it for yourself....the more cities you play the more your cities benefit.   Your new cities will start with any roads from adjacent cities that you've already created/played.  Try to find that in one of the newer city building games.  When you start a new one you can actually see your other city's connecting road when you start out.  Awesome feature.			"

												SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition gives a new feel to the SimCity series as well as offering a fun and new driving system. SC4DE, along with its predecessors, allows you to take full control of a plot of land to design your dream city. You can create world famous iconic buildings such as the Hollywood sign, London Tower, the Empire State Building, and many more! Even though you have this large amount of freedom, you also are presented the challenge of maintaining balance and order in your city. Overall this game is worth your money, mainly because it was made before EA became thieving... umm...""fatherless"" people... Definitely pick it up when you have the chance.			"

												This is a very very good city builder with lots of mod-support. Tips and tricks:1: Make sure to play the game slowly in the beginning, always try to keep a bit of profit.2: Your sims do NOT need a firestaiton, policestation nor a hospital early in the game. theese are used mostly to make your sims more productive and making sure higher income citizens come to your city. if you put them in too early then it will leave your income well below red.3: Why just one city? Building alot of cities and connecting them with rails, highways, ferry routes and so on is very important for the growth of not just your city but for your entire region. In this game building a verý succesfull city whitout neighbouring cities will be super hard of not down right impossible.			"

												I can remember how excited I was to get SC4 Deluxe back when it first came out ...(and I actually did get a good laugh out of 'warped regions' - the improper bit-map config files that appeared to create overlapping cities)--- and I actually had years of play time with this game, before it came to Steam ------ not to mention the oversized plug-in folder, now on it's very own usb drive ---... now it is available on Steam!A few pet peeves with this one: The SC4 terraforming tools were the new 'area effect' ones, NOT an improvement in my opinion (as an 'addition to' would have been nifty - yes, but as a 'complete replacement' ... there were times I would have liked to have the old tile-by-tile tools ... - no); Due to the dev's not understanding that elevated (already having a 'bridge' structure) transit doesn't need to use a BRIDGE to cross 'ground/surface water' (thus creating visual issues resulting from requiring a bridge to cross ANY water (in previous versions of SimCity) neither 'ground/surface water' nor hydroelectric power plants were available in SC4; The near impossible requirements to get a bridge that didn't have water somewhere below it; The way bridges were implemented didn't allow for above ground transit crossing underneath one - regardless of how much difference in elevation there might be; And Electronic Arts only officially released one (of several possible) expansion packages.The (imo) noteworthy redeeming features include: The ability for water craft (ferries, freight and leisure) to make it under a sufficiently high bridge; The stubs, in a neighbor city, that an intercity connection made - of whatever ... transit, utility, etc ... you chose to establish. The (new - for that time) 'modding' tools; As I remember it, the first SimCity to have a 64-bit version; And the bump up in available map sizes (64x64, 128x128, and -NEW- 256x256).All said - IMO - the best city simulater I have seen.

Restart the computer, and all is good.My drivers are up to date, so I'm not sure if I got a file corrupted somehow in the game.  I uninstalled, and redownloaded and get the same issue.I still recommend the game though.  Because it's the best SimCity you'll ever get.  Just wanted to pass along my issue as a heads up.			"

												What a great game for such a famous franchise SimCity 4 is a famous gaming phenomenon. First off there is infinte things to do such as making a robot destroy a city and starting new, or making a new region and designing it and making it your own. Secondly the mod community is absolutly huge including: buldings, cheats, better ordinances, or fences on backyards it's quite a good thing to get into. Additionally the game is rather complex it's challenging to learn if u dont know much about a budget but it deosnt beat u to death just don't spend to much to fast. In all honesty i have never found any bugs on the game that i have thought to be game breaking, but it does crash from time to time on new sytems like windows 7.			"

The replayability of this game is huge, trying to develop different cities against new challenges or even planning entire regions (which can take dozens, even hundreds of hours). Then, when all is said and done, knock out a few hours in sandbox mode by displaying your almighty wrath with earthquakes, fires, alien invasions, and giant robot attacks. Unlike its decendent, SimCity, this game does not have an always-online component (nor does it have any online play) and is a complete package game.			"

												Fun game made awesome by the great modding community. I love to sand box it to design cities and see how it pans out. Some game mechanics are dumb. The little sim jerks hate having to commute to work at all and you can't always connect roads for unappearant reasons. And making corners on elevated highways? God help us all. I would strangle each and every one of the sim advisers. But I really like sandbox builder games. I have a unreasonable amount of time put into Black & White 2 because BUILDINGS YOThe cheats are hilariously offensive. ""weakness pays"" and ""You don't deserve it"". Ha! But weakness pays only spews 1k which is pretty useless unless you are just trying to survive the first part of the game. Get the BSE Funding mod if you like to just build to your hearts content like I do. but seriously. This game is kinda brutal without it. The only way to make a successful city is connected to the ruins of your failed cities. super slow to get money during any part of the game. Sims throw FITS if you raise taxes and are always demanding more stuff. Any amount of industrial creates bad pollution but your sims demand it so you have to scatter it thinly throughout the city and next to parks and they still demand more. Proper zoning is very nit picky. Farms create crazy water pollution. How do you even train it is useless build subways. Tolls can only be placed on avenues and highways and congests traffic badly. I'm not really into games that make me scream from frustration, that's my husband's gig. But for some reason the frustrating aspects of this game just challenge and entice me to play more.			"

Still the city simulator after a decadeFirst, this is a really complex game, similar to how running an actual city is really complex. If you don't like managing a lot of detail, then this game isn't for you. There are a lot of zones, utilities, civic structures, and transportation systems to build. It's a bit overwhelming at first, so make sure to go through the tutorials and start small (e.g., low-density zones, no education system, no hospitals, and no water system). While the complexity makes it a bit hard to get into SC4, it's the same thing that's missing in SimCity Societies and SimCity (2013).Second, unless you're playing on a Mac which gets the updated port by Aspyr, you'll have some technical problems to deal with. Basically, you have to add command line parameters to tell the game to use only one of your CPU's cores and to use resolutions that didn't exist when SC4 was released (like 1920x1080). Search the forums for details on recommended parameters. Once you've gotten that figured out, you might want to fiddle a bit with the graphics options (I think I reduced the shading/shadow effects to minimum). With this sorted out, the game runs pretty smoothly for me and only crashes every few hours on average. Save often to be safe. I have no idea if Aspyr's planning to release a Windows version of their Mac version, but when/if they do, these technical problems should pretty much disappear.Third, there are some issues with game mechanics that make it hard to build big regions without mods. While you can do a lot without adding mods, I strongly recommend using the Network Addon Mod (NAM) and Colossus Addon Mod (CAM), at least after you reach the point where things stop working correctly. Even if you don't enable any of the NAM's custom transportation systems, it's worth it for the improved traffic simulator alone. There are lots of mods for fixing other things and adding pretty much everything, so use your favorite search engine and explore. There's still a really active modding community after a decade.Overall, SimCity 4 is a great game once you put in the time to learn it and work around the technical issues. It has what's missing in the newer SimCity games and doesn't force you to be constantly online. It would be really awesome if Aspyr ports their Mac port to Windows (and Linux!), fixing all the technical issues. Until then, I recommend waiting for this game to go on sale before buying it here. I got it for $5 in early 2014 to replace my CD copy that finally broke.			"

												SimCity 4 is the king of the City builders. While it does have its glitches here and there, they are minor once you get them ironed out. Its best feature by far is the ability to campaign map and build a massive connected metropolitan area of multiple cities. This feature gives it strong replayability as you always want to build new ones to make your first ones better, and thus retrurn to periodicaly. Unlike SimCity 5 - this game is worth its money.			"

												Just look at the amount of hours I've put into this. That's just from when the game came out on steam. Probably the only game I've played more than World of Warcraft, SC4 is the best game out there. Completely unique in it's own right, as there has never been a proper sequel or successor. With a modding community that still remains strong after 8 years the game is still fresh and worth the buy. If you liked any of the previous SimCities or The Sims, you'll love this installment of the series.			"

The addition of roads in zones and the ability to import maps into Sims 2 for playing on there is great. All in all, if you enjoy strategy games, like Zoo tycoon or Roller coaster tycoon, this game will be right up your street.			"

												To all residents of BCIVille:It has come to my attention that a number of you have filed complaints regarding increasing numbers of traffic collisions, crimes and pollution. Rest assured, as mayor I am hard at work on a plan to solve all of our great city's problems at the same time. I cannot say too much right now as it's still in the planning phase, but the general idea of the BCIVille Renewal Project '14 includes an aggressive strategy of tax breaks, industry subsidies and strategic nuclear strikes in the worst areas of the city. As well I'm considering the possibility of using new, exotic materials to simplify our existing infrastructure in order to save our public works departments millions of dollars per year in materials compared to what we've been doing until now. I've discussed the effectiveness of this plan with my advisors and a number of constituents and they all agree: this will work. According to official reports from the BCIVille Department of Quite Reliable Statistics, we should expect to see a 58% increase in cromulence by the year 2016.I understand some of you may have questions or concerns, and believe me, I need your input as citizens to perfect BCIVille for all of us.

I made an adjacent city called Libertopia, the irony being most of it's industrial needs were being met by Dystopia.  Bordering the 2 was a city focused on science, that would probably provide both with their technological needs, be it internet vpns or new weapons technology to oppress the Project residents of Dystopia.

												Shocked I never played this game before despite being a Sim lover. Great city building game that still holds up 12 years later. This game IS worth the $20; don't let that price turn you away. Only issue is the graphics which glitch often when run on newer computers, but from what I've read this game can be modded and I'm sure debugged as well. Even with the graphical glitches I've stil enjoyed playing this game, and my experience hasn't been significantly hindered.			"

												Sim City 4: The game to buy when you were disapointed with the latest edition to the Sim City Franchise.Sim City has been a game that I have grown up with, and will always hold a special place in my heart for. While the graphics are certaintly not up to todays standards, the game offers hours upon hours of fun and relaxation. In the game, you take on the role of the mayor of a brand new city. You have to then design and build this empty plot of land into a large, and busy city. The game is nice because it offers fun and enjoyment to all skill levels. For example, one could simply just build to build, or you could go into such minute details about your city, and try fixing all of the problems. I have poured many hours into this game, and highly recomend it.But as a warning: The game does not support 1920 x 1080 res, and will occasionally crash (only crashed on my laptop, works fine on my tower).

												I got a bug for this series since playing Sim City on the SNES way back. Then again, maybe it wasn't a bug as I never played any of the games apart from the SNES version and this, but I trusted the general angle of the reviews.In short, a great game that's ages superbly. You can really soak up the hours once you get a city going and you have massive control. The 'tutorial' cities give you breathing room and you're bound to learn from your mistakes quickly when you get caught in the traps of over/under development of certain of your cities' aspects.I'm quite rubbish at the game, but that doesn't stop it being one of the most absorbing games I've ever played (in that sense, I'd put it there with the likes of Morrowind, Zelda, FFVII, Shenmue - games that utterly took hold of me!)

With a modding community that still remains strong after 8 years the game is still fresh and worth the buy. If you liked any of the previous SimCities or The Sims, you'll love this installment of the series.			"

The amount of gameplay you can experience is amazing, and you can expand your game so much with mods made by communities til this day!

												It's 99% fantastic on my Win7 PC, ramps up at a good pace, classic play, just enough 'simulation' to make me believe I'm controlling hundreds of thousands of little folks and getting them to build bigger and better buildings, and that the parks I place around town really do suck up the pollution nearby.There's an occasional freeze/bug where I have to fire up Task Manager and put it in its place, but this very rare, and virtually never for a city I've had going for a while.  An acceptable level of downtime for something I keep running alongside while I do my work.If you find it on a holiday sale for, oh, $4.99, I'd say I've gotten more enjoyment out of this than a venti mocha from that one infamous green and white coffee shop franchise.  I'd for sure recommend this to any one who got burned by SimCity5 :)			"

												I'm not as familiar as some might be with the Sim City series. The last one I played was on the SNES and compared to SC4 it definitely has it's differences. Even after 18 years of not playing, it was easy to get back into Sim City after playing through the tutorials. Being able to setup a region and build cities in different sections all across it is cool. Also liked that I can add mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes etc.. and customize the regions to my liking. The Rush hour expansion is a nice addition so I can control what kind of transportation I want in my cities and provides an extra challenge to building my cities. I've only put in a couple of sessions and I know there are so many features in this game I haven't touched on.I would tell anyone who is looking for a strategy/simulation game then this one should be considered. I was very iffy about the newest Sim City which is why I picked this one up. You don't have to worry about being online to play the game and works well with current operating systems. If you are interested in getting a start into Sim City games then I would say start here.			"

												Through careful evaluation, I have concluded that I should never run for mayor...This game, however, is a great way to not only spend some leisure time but also to obtain some knowledge of the mayoral life.  At an institutional level, one can learn about city zoning as well as regulations that go into a communities foundation to becoming a great city.  Highly recommend this adaption of the SimCity series.			"

												The last of the great city builders from the original creators of the genre. Simcity 4 stands head and shoulders above all competition and previous iterations excepting Simcity 2000. With that said, Simcity 4 is a difficult game that should not be taken as a simple game: it is fairly complex and builds off three previous iteractions.Simcity 4 has a thriving modification community that can be found in a variety of places: Simtropolis and Reddit, among other places.With all of that said I cannot speak enough praise of this game.

												SimCity 4 is the king of the City builders. While it does have its glitches here and there, they are minor once you get them ironed out. Its best feature by far is the ability to campaign map and build a massive connected metropolitan area of multiple cities. This feature gives it strong replayability as you always want to build new ones to make your first ones better, and thus retrurn to periodicaly. Unlike SimCity 5 - this game is worth its money.			"

												This is a Fantastic City building and Management sim. I Highly reccomend. You can play it with a degree in city design and still have as much fun as someone who knows f-all about cities. I reccommend playing with the Network Acess Mod with adds roads and improves the pathfinding of the AI, so unemployment due to commute is a thing of the past. I recomend this game as much as i would reccomend Civilzation 4 or 5. The graphics aren't great compared to Battlefeild 4 or GTA V but hey you can tell a building is a building. Also the detail is good you can zoom right in and see your little sims playing about at the school or families going out for a picnic at the Park. So what rating do give this game? A solid 9. Pretty high with 10 being my favourite game of all time. So even though i have NOWHERE near enough experience as some what i have is still enough to merit this as a great game. to me it is comperable to some AAA games. So all in all if your gonna grab a simulator make it this one. heres a more thourough run down of RatingGraphics: 4/5 Sound:5/5( i could listen all day)Custamisation: 3/5 (no micromanaging so if you a fan of that be aware) Fun: 4/5Highly Reccomend			"

												Hard, but that doesn't mean not good.while simcity 3000 will remain my favorite for the rest of the conceivable future, 4 has a certain charm and depth of mechanics that makes me itch for more.the budgeting system has been overhauled allowing for much, much more customization and indepth management of your city's utitlities, waste management, and tax revenue. whereas in 3000 you could only manage RCI taxes as a sort of umbrella for each type, in 4 you can raise and lower taxes based on the pay bracket (for commercial and residential) or the subtype (industrial, separated into agricultural, dirty industry, clean industry and high tech industry). this management allows you to pinpoint taxes where you want them, potentially driving out a class of residents or commerce, or inviting in the same.the zoning rules have changed dramatically. whereas in 3000 you simply designate a plot of land and let the sims do the rest, in 4 each zoned lot has a facing and transportation/utilities needs that have to be met before the lot will develop. designating a large area will automatically add roads so that you don't have to micromanage each lot's transportation needs for the most part.on the topic of transportation, roads in general have recieved an overhaul, splitting them into four classes of road, with separate capacities for travel: streets, traditional roads, avenues and highways. while the avenue, the highway, and of couse the road were availabe in 3000, the avenue was constructed by putting two roads together, and the highway was bank-breakingly overpriced. the newest addition, the street, is a low capacity form of transport that requires very little maintenance.coming back to utility management, each utility building (water pumps, power plants, landfills) has a seperate funding slider that can be adjusted to change the output or intake of the facility in question. such a mechanic can be used to set power systems into standby, or to limit usage of over-producing plants; all very useful for a city that has just begun.the region system is where this game really shines, however. the ability to create dozens of cities and have them all work together is simply incredible.in short, simcity 4 is a very deep, very complicated game, but the rewards are very high. the amount of fun I've had here despite losing is roughly .75 times what I've had in 3000, which is saying something considering how much I've loved 3000.buy it. and a pocket calculator, maybe a budgeting clipboard			"

												Sim City 4: The game to buy when you were disapointed with the latest edition to the Sim City Franchise.Sim City has been a game that I have grown up with, and will always hold a special place in my heart for. While the graphics are certaintly not up to todays standards, the game offers hours upon hours of fun and relaxation. In the game, you take on the role of the mayor of a brand new city. You have to then design and build this empty plot of land into a large, and busy city. The game is nice because it offers fun and enjoyment to all skill levels. For example, one could simply just build to build, or you could go into such minute details about your city, and try fixing all of the problems. I have poured many hours into this game, and highly recomend it.But as a warning: The game does not support 1920 x 1080 res, and will occasionally crash (only crashed on my laptop, works fine on my tower).

												Now I've paid the ten years' debt that I owed Maxis.A decade ago,a friend of mine gave me a pirate CD includes several gamesAnd I've found this game that occupied most of childhood memories of playing games.I was obsessed with it.I played it day and night,I would never be tired of playing this game.At first,I didn't even know how to designate zones,just knew how to place a bunch of fancy buildings and set disasters.But I could also play for a long time with lots of joy.After that I learnt how to designate areas,make citizens(SIMs) happier and attract the rich,I understood this game couldn't just be a simple game,there must be many things and surprises to research and discover.SimCity 4 moved me so much. In this game,you are an omnipotent mayor,developing your ideal city.Planning,construction,expansion,management,these are the main circulation patterns of this game.There are unlimited challenge,creation and innovation.2D graphics are pretty and the details are awesome.Background musics are pleasant and will never get tired of hearing.You can feel that you are really running the city of yours.A great many different mods and plugins can make players have more contents to enjoy.Some said SC series are lack of playability,also some said it's bored,without passion,won't be played for a half hour.I just wanna say,you are just far from dectecting the essence of this game:)			"

Doesn't matter because your police cheif is super mad at you. So you build more police stations? Well now your energy representative is going mad because there isn't enough water. So you add more water stations... well now your environmental representative is going ape, and will shut 10 of those pumps down because of pollution. You add more water treatment facillities, and your budget keeper goes ballistic because of all the money spent on all of this.Who knew running a city was so hard?!  10/10 everyone hates me.

My only hope is that with the new Sim City reboot, they bring back Streets of Sim City and Sim Copter, both of which integrated with older versions of Sim City. Ideally, they could be built straight into the game. Sim City 4 had vehicle missions but you it all took place in the isometric view.			"

												""On Exactitude in Sim City,"" ... ""In that game, the art of mapping attained such perfection that the map of a single city occupied the entirety of a zone, and the map of the region, the entirety of a city. In time, those unconscionable maps no longer satisfied, and the modding community struck a map of a region whose size was that of the region, and which coincided point for point with it. The following gaming generation, who were not so fond of the study of mapping as their forebears had been, saw that that vast map was useless, and not without some pitilessness was it, that they delivered it up to the inclemencies of incompatible versions. In the abandoned websites, still today, there are corrupted files of that map, inhabited by broken links and bugs; in all the Internet there is no other relic of the disciplines of geography."" - Suárez Miranda, Viajes de jugadores prudentes, Libro IV,Cap.

												I'm not sure any Sim game can beat the experience of the original, which most of us came across on a computer in study hall in our middle or high school. It isn't about features, graphics or customization - just one of those times when the first iteration of a game is the most enjoyable, no matter how vast the improvements since then.I commend SC4 for even coming CLOSE to that experience. Despite the ""it's not the original"" feeling I do find myself getting wrapped up in creating my perfect city. This game has everything you'd want out of a city builder, complete with a street view and dispatching fire trucks. Graphically it's pretty good. It's not awe-inspiring or offputting, just good enough to not be a distraction - which is exactly the pocket a game like this should fit into. After all, there are plenty of games to be visually struck by, that just isn't the point of a city builder. Options and control are far more important, and it exceeds expectations in leaps and bounds.One thing I always wished was possible was differing time periods - being able to make a town with a 60's feel, or the Old West - presenting a lot of different problems, using different buildings, etc. I watch Back to the Future a lot (a lot!) so perhaps I'm alone in that. Either way, SC4 is moddable.. so if you're good at that kinda thing you might be able to create an even better experience for yourself.			"

												This game is an amasing game with multiple great features, Godmode is fun, and driving cars around as random Sims that you may have made (You need to own the Sims) The missions are fun, and, I never thought making a city could be so addicting, the things I dislike is that you can't rename your city, if you dont do the tutorials, you will almost never find out how to make citizens come in your city and the music, it's... wierd. (If you did that like me, just make a coal(?) power plant)I recommend this to anyone.			"

The gameplay has some iffy spots here and there(e.g.: 90% of the population trying to commute with cars instead of by walking despite the workplace being a mere two blocks away), but the base gameplay is amazing and so are the numerous community mods that range from bug fixes to extra road and building types. I admit I haven't played the new SimCity, but from what I see, this is the superior SimCity game.			"

												I must have bought this game at least 3 times over the years, having worn out old disc copies before picking it up here on Steam.Pretty much everything that is wrong with the new SimCity was right in SimCity 4, which was the culmination of over a decade of evolution through the original SimCity, SimCity 2000 and SimCity 3000. A decade further on, there is still a strong community around the game, and plenty of mods available to change everything from the appearance of water to the way the entire highway system works.If you want to build a sprawling metropolis or a rural country region, this is certainly the game to go with. Only Cities Skylines has come close since.			"

												SimCity 4 is a game that I spent a lot of time with in my early 20s. It had its fair share of bugs when it was first released and I remember a lot of frustration on forums early on. Crashes were frequent and the performance was not great despite having hardware more than capable of handling it. These many years later, the game runs much more smoothly than it ever did and it's a joy to go back and play. It's complex without being irritating (I will never understand where to put bus stations to get them to work properly, though). I've played SimCity since the first game was released in the late 80s (I played it in the early 90s), and SC4 ranks high on my list - perhaps below SC2000, but slightly higher than SC3000. The beauty of SC4 is the size of the maps, the inclusion of regions and the varied building style. The customisation of terrain is also the most advanced of all of the SimCities (in the latest one, terrain editing is sadly lacking). The latest SimCity is not worthy of the name and this represents the last of the good ones. If you're wanting a more recent city builder, consider Cities Skylines.			"

												Personally, SimCity 4 is my favorite SimCity. It trumps even the new titles of simulation in cities for its innovation and powerful software. It has all the ending tools you need to build any city on almost any size. You can also download cities from internet that add a lot to the game. But beware, if you've never played. A SimCity title before, this game will be difficult. Lastly, looking for bugs, I found one major one, where houses built on certain hills or cliffs will build itself in a position the it can't get a drive way to leave it.			"

												Although by no means perfect, Simcity 4 is probably the best (read: most detailed) city building game ever made. It simply has all of the things that would make any particular city builder great all in one place. A massive area for each city, tools for laying out your city that can be either very quick and easy to use or super detailed, numerous ways to tackle different problems, interesting rewards for progress,♥♥♥♥♥♥ this games graphs are great. The graphics and soundtrack show their age but are still great, and the absurd level of detail in every conceivable place is the icing on top. Almost everything about this game is a model example of fantastic game design. Still, if poor preformace is a deal breaker for you then you may want to take a pass; the game doesn't run terribly well on modern machines, especially with as large of cites as are possible.			"

												SimCity 4 is one of my favorite ""city building/managment"" games.  I originally had the ""SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition"" on 4 CD's but after fighing with EA to get the software installed and working. I just gave up and bought the game on Steam when there had it for like $7.00. I'm glad that I purchased the game on Steam!!! As long as I have my Steam account I will always play the game.Update 1/24/2015Now that I have been playing SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition thru Steam I love the game more so now. I also added the following in Steam for SC4's ""Set Launch Options"": -CustomResolution:enabled -r1600x1200x32 -d:DirectX -CPUPriority:high -CPUCount:1 -intro:off. SC4 been playing with no more crashes.

												I love this game. By far the best city-simulator of all time. Perfected and built upon its predecessors dating back to 1989, this 12 year-old game still holds up as the greatest. The mechanics are awesome, the graphics are hypo-realistic for a bird's-eye isometric perspective of a 3D city. This game puts SimCity (2013) to shame. If you are looking for the definitive city-simulator, this game is for you. Even the mini games are exciting, where you can do anything from piloting a crop duster to driving a tank with a working turret! Before you establish the city, you can play around with the landscape, making plateaus to valleys and rivers. You can also create disasters and unleash them on your city, such as volcanos, earthquakes, giant robots, and even UFOs! This version comes with the Rush Hour expansion pack, which comes with useful items like avenues and a vastly-improved library of transportation items like parking garages, subways, monorails, ground and elevated highways, and overpasses and exits to roads. Tip: closely monitor your RCI (Residential, Commercial, and Industrial demand) to suit to the needs of your sim citizens. Also, closely monitor your finances; you'll get kicked out if you go too far into debt, with a message stating ""maybe you can take your chances running for senator!""			"

												This game is a lovely play, I clocked in a good amount of time and its a game you can easily find yourself addicted to. It ages well despite it's appearance and it's definitely something I would recommend if you're into City building type games.The only issue is, I've come across quite a catastrophic problem, I don't know if it's because my drivers recently updated or something else but one day the game just completely stopped opening up, the game would show up in the processes but then immediately vanish as if it were closed out. That was an extreme disappointment to me considering how much I played this game. I've looked into this issue and I can't find anything that could've caused this to suddenly happen. I won't say that this is an assured issue because very few people have ever had this problem, I feel like it may be an issue with carrying over to a more modern PC considering I run Windows 10 and the recommended OS is Windows XP. Trust me that it is definitely a good buy ESPECIALLY on sale, like seriously nab that♥♥♥♥♥♥ But be aware that you might run into some issues with such an old game on a modern PC just as a warning, besides that play away!

												Different in scale to Cities Skylines, while the individual map sizes are smaller, larger buildings and parks create more realistic cities, and the simulation is far more advanced here. However as a result it is a hell of a lot more complicated to get a perfect city up and running than C:S. Both are worth your time, and this still stands up, 13 years after it's release.			"

												For those who have become greatly disappointed with the new SimCity, this game reminds us of how great EA once was. It's better than SimCity 3000, and while it could have been more pratical or player-friendly, it was a game made in 2003, when games like this were still on the process of being more accessible. Nevertheless, it's still a magnific, addicting game.			"

												City-building with no DRM or always online requirement! You can even download all necessary files for this game from Steam, and then take it offline to play wherever. What more could you wish for...SC4 has encouraged me to resign my more malevolent personality traits to a giant, sprawling metropolis in digital Simtopia. It has allowed me to remain calm and composed in situations that require it, and my attitude on other world-building sandbox games (like Minecraft) has improved because I take my fire-fisted griefer heart over to my Sims, instead.Would I recommend SimCity 4 Deluxe Edition? Do bears like honey? Duh.			"

												Running low on funds to run your city?  You can do missions for the good guys or the bad guys and everything will be fine...or will it?   Go from building the city to playing one of the citizens real quick and back again.  But don't mess up too often or it could bankrupt the whole town.Has some bugs and is real old tech.  Still it is lots of fun.Simcity online should have been more like this game.Oh and another thing....the theme music for this game is Legendary.....boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom....etc....this music makes everyone instantly cooler just for listening.Oh and one more thing....you can actually connect your cities with actual roads and they benefit from the traffic and....well you gotta see it for yourself....the more cities you play the more your cities benefit.   Your new cities will start with any roads from adjacent cities that you've already created/played.  Try to find that in one of the newer city building games.  When you start a new one you can actually see your other city's connecting road when you start out.  Awesome feature.			"
