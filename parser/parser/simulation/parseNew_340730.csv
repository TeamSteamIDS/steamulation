TL:DRPlay the main Sunrider series first then buy this game.  Claim your waifu and show her your Vanguard Cannon.The Steam release is CENSORED but you can easily install the official restoration patch from the Sunrider website to view the girls in all their naked glory the way God intended.  Now with the most important part out of the way, on to the other stuff.Made by the same developer that made the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, Sunrider Academy takes those memorable characters and transplants them into a standard Japanese style school setting as a dating sim/time management/visual novel game.  You play as Kayto Shields, Vice-President of the student council, and are tasked with making sure the three ""trouble school clubs"" are whipped into shape.  At the same time, you must also manage your duties as a school student and keep up with homework, exams, and finding a girlfriend before the end of the year otherwise it's BAD END!First of all, you DO NOT need to play Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius first but I highly recommend you do because one, it's an excellent game, two, it will provide some nice background to the characters and setting, and three, it's FREEEEE.  The cast of characters of Sunrider Academy carry the same personalities from the other games from the Sunrider franchise so if you're a fan, you can expect Asaga to be as bubbly as ever and Ava to have the same stern demeanor.  Not every character returns however as the devs made it perfectly clear they didn't have the budget for more than 4 main heroines so this is sad news for fans of Claude, Icari, or Kryska.  Fortunately, I did encounter brand new characters which I can already tell will be an integral part of the story.The gameplay should be familiar to veterans of dating sims or visual novels.  You'll be reading a lot of text and making the occasional decision to branch out the story as per standard with these types of games.  The bulk of the gameplay however, is in time management.  Kayto has different stats and each one has an effect on the choices you make in-game.  For example, having high intelligence will increase your exam scores while having high athleticism will reduce your chances of getting sick.  You'll be raising your stats by participating in activities like studying or exercising and these can succeed or fail based on luck and game difficulty.  Fortunately, if you don't like the RNG aspect of success/failure then you can lower the game's difficulty all the way down to ""waifu-mode"" to make it impossible to fail.As mentioned before, you are charged with propping up the three worst performing clubs (kendo, science, swimming) otherwise the club will be disbanded and it's BAD END.  You can spend your time recruiting more members, overseeing team practice, or raising morale.  Each will have an effect on their performance during competitions which is important for winning prestige.  If you can manage to get your clubs up to speed and get lots of first place finishes then you'll win a ton of prestige which is important as this minimum requirement goes up every month.In addition to maintaining the clubs, you also have your own responsibilities as a student.  You are assigned homework every week and there are exams every month.  You must score above 60% each month otherwise you'll get a BAD END.  And of course, the whole point of the game is to secure a girlfriend before the year is over.  Flirt, buy gifts, and make the correct decisions to woo the maiden of your choice.  It's all a delicate balancing act as you must juggle your time between raising your stats, managing the clubs, and dating the girls.The art is similar in style to the previous Sunrider games but vastly improved.  I personally like it very much and the school uniforms actually make sense this time.  It was weird seeing military officers wear school uniforms in Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius but now that they're in an actual school it doesn't look out of place.The music is as great as ever.  The backing tracks fit the game nicely and when drama hits, you'll know right away because the music changes and really shifts the mood.If you're still not sure whether or not to spend the money on this game, then check out the free demo first.  Also, do yourself a favor and play the excellent Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius while you're at it!RELEASE UPDATEI have completed all 4 arcs and, essentially, the entire game.  So here are my final thoughts.Sola: Very interesting and original story but uninspired ending.  Her ending is actually pretty happy but the way it was resolved just reeks of deus ex machina.  Poor Sola... at least she still kicks @$$ in the main Sunrider series.Chigara: My favorite girl from Sunrider comes with a great story and a great ending.  Her arc has a nice blend of charm and sci-fi and is resolved quite well.  You will get cavities because of how sweet her ending scene is.Asaga: ""The Wild One"" has a fun if fairly unoriginal story.  At least it is resolved well and Asaga is by far the funniest girl to pursue.  I genuinely laughed out a loud a bunch of times playing through her delightful arc.Ava: Wow, I expected her arc to be intense based on her personality and it doesn't disappoint.  Definitely the most rewarding ending as the game makes you feel like you work your butt off to achieve it and it shows.  Chigara may still be my number one but after playing through Ava's arc, I may have to reevaluate.Each arc takes about 3-5 hours to complete.  There is no vast overarching story where you have to complete all the arcs before getting a ""real ending"".  Each arc stands on its own as its own individual story.Each girl, except for Ava, has 4 h-scenes.  Ava only gets 3.  Boo!I have two major gripes with the game.First is the writer's overzealous use of romanji.  I understand this game caters to fans of anime and Japanese culture but every time I see ""mou"" instead of ""geez"" or ""pan"" instead of ""bread"" I roll my eyes.  There is no need for this type of unnecessary pandering in a game that is 90% text.Second is the dull gameplay. The game is half visual novel/half time management.  The visual novel part is excellent.  The time management... not so much.  It's like eating a wonderful steak but being force fed undercooked mashed potatoes in between each bite.Still, I greatly enjoyed my time with Sunrider Academy.  Thirty bucks is a bit steep but I feel like my money was well spent.  Should you buy it?  I would say yes IF you can stomach the monotonous gameplay to get to the juicy story bits.  Try before you buy!			"

""Didn't read lol"" ReviewLike playing Harvest Moon, but instead of crops and cattle, you're dealing with exams and club tournaments.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Real ReviewThe art is beautiful, the characters, background images, and the soundtracks too.Love the story. A lot of funny dialogues, sometimes they linked to the original Sunrider game. There are times when you feel a little sad, and there are also times when you want to facepalm yourself because of the characters behaviour.There are no voice for the characters. I know there are visual novel games that have voices for their characters, and they are cheaper.It feels kinda boring if you look it from the stat management sim. It's always the same routines. Unless there are story dialogue, but it's not that much compared to the time when we need to manage our stats.As we know, steam does not allow sexual content, so the devs make an official content restoration patch to restore the deleted part of the steam version of the game. In my opinion, even without the patch, this game is already unappropriate to be played by kids. So don't hesitate to patch it if you buy the game. You can find the link to the patch in the discussion page.If you only interested on the story, there are some tricks to make this game easier. I know it's cheating, but if that makes you able to enjoy the game you bought then I think it's not a problem. Check the community guide for more information.Overall, I enjoy playing this game, regardless of the negative sides this game gives us. I know the price is quite high, but if you really want this game, don't hesitate to buy it. If you patience enough, you can wait until the price drops. Might need some times, though.			"

												First and foremost do not let the simple presentation fool you, Sunrider Academy is a wonderful combination of VN, dating sim, and resource management; but it's the excellent writing that makes this game shine.  Both the artwork and music are neatly designed and fit the mood of the game well. Fan service is mild, with romance and WTF moments being the main theme (not graphic sex). Each of the four girls you can date (and ultimately marry) have totally unique back stories that are a combination of: sweet, romantic, funny, and at times even dark and serious. Likewise each girl's personality is unique, making each relationship route wonderful in its own way. Even the good endings are totally different in overall personality. Dialogue is text only, but again it is VERY well written; even better than many big budget console games. Advice: save Asaga for last because while each good ending is a happy one, hers is (in my opinion) the most romantic/cheerful ending.Note: there are many funny inside jokes and easter eggs relating to Sunrider Mask of Arcadius. Decision making is simple and occasionally funny, and will to some degree affect the girls' opinion of you. And it ~is~ possible to have more than one path oppen up to you--although you must ultimately choose one.  Design wonk: ""Stress"" attribute accumulates way too fast. Player solution: turn difficulty to Casual or VN mode, otherwise Kayto will be working part-time jobs just to pay for eroges. However, purchased buffs eventually solve this problem.Grade: Solid B+/A-I felt a range of emotions while playing Sunrider Academy: occasionally laughing and responding out loud (along with Kayto) to some of the situations/conversations. This is one that you will feel a little sad that it has to end. Very good game.			"

												The other reviews have already established the things that needed to be said 'yadda yadda play Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius, good game, free, etc etc.' So I won't repeat after them. I'll be brief about the positive points of Academy: The writing is fun, the characters jolly, the art solid. Also continued props for providing decensoring patches.Now I don't wanna be a negative ninny but I do feel like I gotta point out some of the negatives aspects of Academy... The gameplay feels... unsatisfactory for a dating sim. Part of a dating sim's fun is raising those stats to reach certain requirements, to reach those ""99 str required to win the tournament and conquer her athlete heart"" goals. Academy's stat building however, is purely based on randomness... even to the point that you randomly lose stats during your many moments of sleep. Just spend your hard earned credits on raising your luck by 4 points? You can get unlucky and lose 7 points of luck right after, just by sleeping. Wanna help Sola win the swimming tournament? Well, you better pray for some good RNG because it sure as hell isn't going to be coming from your good decision making and planning.On top of that, the feedback you get from your stats is nonexistent. What does 30 fitness mean? Is that a lot? On what scale do I compare this with? What does the fitness stat even do? I don't seem to be needing it for anything in particular, aside from a vague tutorial message, telling me that it somehow correlates with stress levels. But stress suffers from the exact same lack of feedback. What is too much stress? 20? 30? 50? There doesn't seem to be a visible cap or any kind of information how bad my stress levels are. Just a number.Furthermore, the chances of meeting a person, so you can talk to them, is again, based purely on randomness. And I really feel like the game dropped the ball on the meetings outside of the scripted events. The scripted events never fail to amuse, but the random chance meetings just have you click a conversation topic button, and the girl will respond negative or positive with a few generic sentences. You don't get to know anything new about them or get any new interesting dialogue. Not to mention that the girls are each supposedly interested in certain topics and less so in other ones. But outside a few obvious ones (Sola liking to talk about religion since she works at a shrine, and Ava liking politics because you learn about this in a scripted event) the game doesn't really provide you with information about what's suppose to be a good conversation topic or not. So all that is left to you is to trial&error (and if need be, save scum, because it's the only way to get even with the RNG) your way through.28 euro (or your regional equivalent) feels a bit too steep of a price for the rather shallow rng based gameplay that Academy provides.

												Firstly I recommend you download the denpa restoration patch which can be found here:http://sunrider-vn.com/sunrider-academy-feb-major-update/?age-verified=f5ee74703aBeware though this will make the game 18+Thoroughy enjoyed this visual novel/stat managements game. Completed all 4 routes, each story was genuinley fantastic with Sola arc being my favourite. The main character you control actually has some depth to him which is rare in vn's the protagonist is usually a dense ♥♥♥♥er.Pros :. Excellent story arcs. Beautiful art design. Has a long lifespan, took me 23 hrs to do all 4 routes and that was me rushing it.F4CKING LOVE this game, just sayin'			"

												Okay well to start off, i'm not giving this a bad review because I dislike the game. It is simply because it is way too stretched out and too long. Hah! Get it? Nvm... anyways.I'll keep it simple and to the point. This game is a great visual novel, and the concept of it is great. This game expects you to make 4 playthroughs with all 4 girls and that's all fine and dandy. However, after about few hours into the game after talking a lot, events happening, and lots of things to do, you find yourself clickig the exact same things for long period of time without anything actually happening. That's my whole problem. The game dies off after first few hours, and since you want to make at least one playthrough, you go long periods of drought without any events happening with the girls except your occasional club tournaments which become very repetative. But what is more repetative is you doing the same exact things every single day. Study, lunch, go for a walk, museum, arcade etc. At first it's a lot to do, but after a while it becomes so repetative that you want to rip your hair out.This game could have been so much more amazing if it wouldn't be so stretched out with so much drought, or at least it was filled with so much things going on like the first few hours. If that couldn't be done, shortening it would do it much good. I also think that taking a route where you only have to do a playthrough with one girl is kinda boring. That's just my take.Anyways, thanks for taking the time to read. If you want a great visual knowel this is it, and the pictures... well... you'll be satisfied. Be ready for the content drought though after first few hours though. Happy Adventures!			"

												""And now for something completely different...""Sunrider Academy is a spin-off game that has many of the same characters who are present in Sunrider Mask of Arcadius, a free game (also available on Steam). Mask of Arcadius is a visual novel space opera game with tactical turn-based hex strategy elements. Sunrider Academy, on the other hand, is a visual novel school dating game with stat management elements. The protagonist and character you play, Kayto Shields, is the same in both games, though he's a captain in Arcadius and a high school student in Academy. Playing Arcadius first might be a good idea, as there are MANY references to Arcadius in Academy. However, I personally played through one route of Academy before playing Arcadius, and found that it isn't *that* necessary to play it first. It certainly didn't affect my enjoyment of Academy.Now, as for my personal experience. When I picked up this game, I had just finished playing Eden* (which I would definitely recommend for those in favor of emotionally touching stories). However, whereas playing Eden* pretty much involves pressing the Enter/mouse button until the game finally ends, Sunrider is probably one of the more, if not most, complicated visual novel games I have ever played.Without spoiling too much, the game starts with you as the Vice President of the Student Council, and you are entrusted by the President with the responsibility of helping three troubled clubs over the course of a year. Throughout the game, you are responsible for raising their membership, competition readiness, and morale, each of which plays a role in how well each club does at various competitions, which happen roughly once a month. Placing bronze, silver, or gold at these competitions earns prestige points, and you need a certain number of prestige points in order to avoid a bad end.While managing those clubs, you have to keep track of your own needs as well. Kayto, the main character, has several main stats to juggle, including Fitness, Intelligence, Charisma, Stress, Money, and Homework. Homework is issued regularly every week, and has to be finished by the end of the week or could lower your grades. Money is required for various items you can buy to boost your stats or to visit various places around the city and can be earned through taking on jobs. Fitness, Intelligence, and Charisma are used in various challenges in school and competition. Finally, and it's the big one, is stress. MANY MANY activities cause stress, and it can be very difficult, especially on the first playthrough, to keep stress down to a reasonable level. When stress rises to a high level, it can cause you to get sick, become hospitalized, and (as you would expect) lead to a bad end.Then, on top of your character management, there's the relationship aspect. As the store description indicates, early in the game, you make a bet with your sister that you would have a girlfriend at the end of the year. There are four girls you can pursue a relationship with (not including your sister, who doesn't have a route or any romance associated with her excluding a minor achievement), and pursuing romance with them requires a small conversational mini-game that you can play any time you go to lunch or visit various places around the city. There is some RNG involved in how often a girl shows up, and different girls show up in different places at different rates, so if you are pursuing a specific girl, it may difficult to get an encounter with her initially unless you consult a guide that shows the statistical chance of finding a girl in a specific location. Through this conversational minigame and also by getting girls gifts, you can unlock their routes roughly towards the middle of the game, and you do get to pick which girl you want to pursue as long as you have unlocked their route.So yeah, as you might be able to deduce from above, it's an especially complicated game for a visual novel, and there's a lot more complexity to the game than mentioned above. Is it worth playing? For better or worse, the stat management is the primary time component of the game. Even if you play on Waifu mode (easiest mode), you'll probably be spending nearly 4 hours of an estimated 5 hour playthrough per route grinding away on daily activities that award various stats for yourself, your relationships, or your clubs. If you play on Normal or the incredibly statistically unfair Space Whale mode (which I'm doing for my current third playthrough), you'll probably be looking at seven hours or more per playthrough, assuming you can even make through the game without failing in one of the many different possible ways. The story itself doesn't require much interaction from the player. There are a few choices that you have to make, but there certainly aren't many, and at least the two routes that I have played so far have little player interaction or influence (in other words, stuff happens without you having to do anything).Despite all that, I still think the game is worth it. Yes, the stat management stuff might get boring after a playthrough, but the story is equal parts funny (in my opinion anyways) and cute, and the endings are especially happy (if you can make it through to the end). In addition, the game has some pretty good music, and even though I've heard it for many hours now through my (currently) 10 hours of playtime, it doesn't seem to grow old. I still enjoy listening to it in much the same way that I enjoyed Eden*'s music, though I find it unfortunate that Sunrider Academy's music is not available in soundtrack form. The visuals are...of course visual novel quality, which means 2D static art for the most part, but it is drawn very well, though for me it seems a bit...different from a traditional Japanese style visual novel.There are a few concerns that I would like to mention for a prospective buyer. The cost is certainly one potential problem, and there aren't that many visual novels on Steam that cost this much. Then again, as mentioned before, there aren't very many visual novels on Steam that offer the same amount of gameplay either. The performance might also be a problem as well. The game seems to slow down in long sessions, probably due to some kind of memory leak. Pressing Ctrl-Alt-Del to access the task manager seems to make the transitions become too fast to read through in game, which can only be fixed by a game restart.In summary (TLDR of sorts), if you are interested in visual novel games, this is certainly a good one to try. With four routes and a unique statistical management game, it will definitely be more involving than the average visual novel. The story is quite decent for a VN (though not as impactful and emotionally moving as Eden*) and quite funny in places to boot, and while the statistical management stuff might be difficult initially and become kinda grindy after a playthrough or two, it's probably still interesting enough to keep motivated to continue playing. If you are on the fence or still hesitant, there's both a demo for Sunrider Academy and the completely free Sunrider Mask of Arcadius to try first.			"

Posted: February 16, 2016
												Finally! A positive review for a visual novel. Not neutral or ""somewhere-in-the-middle"" or just plainly meh, but not meh enough to give it thumbs down. A true positive review for truly good game. And to be honest, I didn't expect this one to be good - creators of VNs with h-content often forget, that they are still creating VISUAL NOVEL, so a game that should be base on solid story and not merely anime boobs. Luckily, this title doesn't have that problem.Pros:+Graphic. Let's start with something obvious here. Characters, CGs, backgrounds - everything looks good and consistent.+Music. It changes! I know, it shouldn't be something surprising, but after playing dozens of VNs with same looping music that never reflect the atmosphere of scenes... It truly is. And it's nice music too. Even the casual tune in the background that plays when you're raising stats is rather enjoyable and doesn't get annoying.+Plot. This is a school-life simulator with sci-fi elements. I must admit that the story is really well written. For the first half of the game it's very light-hearted and funny, but when you're on specific route, it get a bit darker and more serious turn. +Writing. Really good. Most of the time dialogues looks realistic. You know, like part of conversation that could happen in the real life, as oppose to dialogues in many VNs.+Characters. I'm surprised, but I actually liked all of characters. Little sister was a bit annoying, but she was supposed to be, so it didn't bother me. Other girls have their own personalities, they were unique and likeable. They were acting like people, you know, actual GIRLS instead of CUTE-SWEET-ALWAYS-INTO-YOU. (*cough* Princess Evangile. *cough*)+Protagonist. Funny! Liekable! Relateable! With his own personality. He actually says a lot of reasonable things about relationships and what is important for him in terms of love, instead of just being a perv. This is a huge contrast to most h-content VNs and even protagonists in general (male or female) - they often tend to lack personality and when you think about it, there is literally not a single reason why other characters would be interested in them. Here protagonist is really cool, reliable and friendly guy, so it's not surprising that he's gaining popularity. +Gameplay. This is a stat raising game, so if you don't like that, you may be a little annoyed with that aspect (though there are few difficulty levels, so even if you're not good with that sort of things, you should not have problems to finish the game). I enjoyed it very much. Not only you're raising your personal stats and earning money like in many VNs, but also managing three clubs and trying to make them win championship. +Challenging. If you don't like challenge - you set easiest difficulty and you're good to go. But if you like managing stats, there are higher difficulty to picks, which is awesome.+Setting. Game doesn't take place on Earth. It's alternate universe with alternate time system, many timeliness and typical science fiction stuff. Yet it's very well done and doesn't ""override"" the whole school-life concept.+Well done. Really. I haven't encountered any bugs, everything looks good, everything sounds good, you get all options you may need and of course big resolution - which, sadly, still isn't something ""normal"" even for very pricey VNs.Cons:-Subjective route-specific things. I will mention them below.-Too long. The last three months of the game were the most boring ones. There wasn't many events, just few scenes, so basically you're just focused on raising stats. The bad thing is, at this point, if you were managing them well, you pretty much have it all under control, so... At this point you just clicking randomly to get to the next scene. And those doesn't happen often.Routes:Currently I just finished one route, but I'm planning to do more, so this review will be upgraded in near future. There won't be any plot-related spoilers here, just my opinion after finishing route.Chigara - For the first half of the game I liked her the most, so that's why I went with her. To be honest though, her route was kind of awkward and disappointing. Instead of being just loveable, a bit shy girl, she turns out to be... Eee... Very child-like, and that bothered me a lot. Especially during H-scenes. She doesn't know anything about sex. And no, I don't mean the fact that she doesn't have experience. She acts like she literally have no idea how this works, so I felt kind of bad at this point. And her childlish-like behavior doesn't help. Also  if you let go the thing that you want, instead of fighting for it, you simply don't deserve it. So I started liking her a lot and ended up feeling kind of ""meh"" and ""nope"". Not sure if I would recommend her for a first route.			"

												So while the ""main"" game is a galactic war drama thing that happens to have anime girls who sometimes do anime girl things when not fighting in bloody battles, this spin-off game is a full-blown high school dating sim. It's also a stat management game, which unfortunately ends up being the majority of what your playtime is. It isn't fun and there is alot of it to do. It's just a thing you are forced to go through until the next story event happens.Now the story stuff is pretty decent. There are four routes involving the four main girls from the original game (Ava, Asaga, Chigara, and Sola). And while it is sad that some of the other interesting characters are missing from this game (Icari), at least the ones that are here are good on their own. Also worth mentioning is the little sister, Maray, who manages to be both a huggable bundle of cuteness and the most annoying creature on the planet. I don't have any siblings, so... maybe this is how they are like? I am not sure. The story routes, when you manage to play them after going through all that stat management BS, tend to have a comedic first half followed by a dramatic second half as unpleasant stuff happens. For anyone who is familiar with Key/VisualArts' VN's/animes (Kanon, Clannad, Little Busters!), then you know exactly what you are in for. And while what is found in this game is not quite as memorable, it is still decent and capable of delivering powerful emotions. Also, like the original Sunrider, Academy is filled with suggestive material (even without Claude), and a patch can turn this game into an eroge for people who are into that sort of thing.Lastly, since this is a spin-off, you probably should play the main Sunrider game (which is completely free) before even considering this. References are in abundance, and some can be considered spoilers for events in the main game....And here I come to an impasse. Normally I would recommend this game for its story and characters, but you spend less time with them than you do with an annoying stat management system that is just an irritating chore getting in the way of what is actually worth seeing in this game. And there is no ""maybe"" option on Steam, so I find myself in trouble.Ultimately, I am going to choose yes because even if the stat stuff is stupid, a game patch (which you need to install manually for some reason) makes the lowest game difficulty (appropriately called ""waifu mode"") make the stat stuff basically impossible to fail at. So you can just set to that difficulty and breeze through all the nonsense to just focus on the story. It makes the game better, and screw anyone who would judge you for being a ""noob"" for setting a game to easy.Bwee...			"

												It really isn't that great unless you *really* enjoy resource management. You will be doing more of that than engaging in story elements. It gets repetitive very quickly, and can easily send your character on a death spiral if you don't stay on top of it.Each of the girls themselves put the player on a second story arc for different late game endings. Although I appreciate the reality that girlfriends aren't simply handed to you on a silver platter, what I don't like is that you can enter one of these story arcs, miss a completely random encounter from week 3 or something that you would never have known about had you not looked up a guide for the game, and then have the story arc stall on you. This results in you reaching a mid to late game key calendar event without a girl willing to attend it with you, netting you a bad end.Why let the player enter the story arc at all with the girl if something like that is going to ruin everything in the end? The player might even make it a few hours past entering the story arc before reaching the festival and then receiving bad end. Without at least one full playthrough, the player might not even be aware of their pending failure because of how heavily engrained the resource management gameplay is. Then, without looking up a guide, the player may fruitlessly try to recover and continue, simply hitting bad end over and over again because they didn't save early enough to hit any missing random encounters on the way through.If it were not for the resource management gameplay, the game story line for all of the endings would likely last less than 10 hours. If the player plays the game on the lowest difficulty just so they might actually reach the ending, the gameplay itself will be boring and the fairly generic harem storylines won't make up for it.Unless all you really want is a resouce management game, this game isn't worth $30, and probably isn't worth buying on sale unless you just want to collect a pile of visual novels for the sake of it.

Early Access Review
								Before I start I'll say right now you'll definitely have a lot more laughs if you play Sunrider Mask of Arcadius first. I've only just started Academy but I'm already enjoying it quite a bit. Got through the first week of the demo and quickly decided I wanted to purchase the game fully. It runs smoothly and has neat and accessible menus. Lots of cute character animations, improved art, and a pretty solid soundtrack so far. I wonder if the voice actors will return for this game?Juggling your home, school, and love life turned out to be a lot more challenging than I expected. I went into it with a Long Live the Queen mindset and while that helped I'm still not quite sure if I'm doing the right thing, ^^;  Make sure to save-scum because I'm sure in the harder modes and in the end-game you'll need all the bonuses you can get.I can't say much in regards for the story and relationships just yet but I'm keeping hopes up for this one. I would gladly pay 30$ for Mask of Arcadius so I don't doubt this game is worth the same. :D* * *Review pt.2 - Update -small NOT plot relevant spoilers ahead-So I'm nearing the completion of the 3rd month of the in-game calendar. It becomes much easier to handle club activities after you've properly prepared the stats for their first challenges. My only concern is the Fitness stat for I have yet to see that skill come into play so far so it kinda leaves one wondering what it's for...? 	Knowing none of the routes are complete yet, it's hard to say no to any of the girls. (Turning down sweets for a certain someone felt so bad but I must remain vigiliant for the true waifu >_>)The story has a nice, slow pace; leaving enough time for each girl to tell a bit of their story. While that may not be good for the more thirsty gamers, I really appreciate it ^^ Script is decent and pretty consistent with its humour. Couple moments where Kayto's less than savvy comments bugged me a little. (Whining about the friendzone, girls should be into makeup/dating, blehblahmehboringpsssch e_o;; though I don't expect much from a vn I will say this one has been pretty good in this regard.) Talking to Maray nearly every time I want to go sleep feels redundant after a while. It's either make her laugh or get the whole siscon crack. And for what purpose? Is there a bonus for being friendly with your sister? I mean I try to be as nice as Kayto allows ;pOther than that it's pretty fun watching Kayto become more confident in his studies and taking pride in his job as club manager. Looking forward to the routes being finished!			"

												This game could be good if it had a LOT more content. Don't get me wrong the game lasts for 500 days and has somewhere in the ball park of 1800 choices, but that's just it! There are only four girls and you can't just ask them out. If you do get to the point when you can pick one of their ""routes"" you will be totally locked down to that girl. You pick Ava, like I did, and you most likely have to start a new 12 hour game to try to choose a different girl.Pro: The game has conditioned me to tell myself 3 fitness, 2 stress every time I work out (I'm making some progress).Cons: Not enough girls, takes too long to even start dating a girl, can only date one girl per playthrough, if you happen to be crazy about achievements it'll probably take 60+ boring hours and a lot of bad endings, too many choices or days (they should at least change it so you plan the day or week all at once). Oh one last thing, when the girls all like you as much as the can (10 hearts) they no longer talk to you so the game becomes choose your activities and talk to your sister for hours on end.			"

												I regret getting this game for this price, RNG-heavy gameplay which raises more frustration than enjoyment despite having something addictive about it. A little bit of bad RNG can make it all go terribly wrong and it's really hard to come back, making you save the game a lot and downloading old save files in hopes of making better decisions/having better luck.When the game is at a point where your stress levels are so high that you can't do anything and you have no money it just becomes hopeless. There are strategies that work in this game but most of the gameplay is just figuring out how the gameeven works and abusing it, which is not enjoyable to me.I do enjoy the characters a lot, so I just need to overcome my competitive nature and play it on the easiest difficulty or something. The main gameplay took so much of my attention and I ended up not even caring about the girls, instead just trying to figure out ways to win the seemingly RNG contests and keep my stress levels acceptable. It's just way too easy to make the whole game unwinnable.			"

												(Full Release Log)Current Game has reached my books as a 9/10.Characters: Development has grown to show more of a natural VN setting even with prior knowledge to this game from S:MOASpecifics: Sola I love what you did but wished more CGChigara: Incredible making me rejudge her character a bitAsaga: Okay you got me good on this oneMaray: Like the helped wish for later Imouto Route unlocked sometimeCg: Definitely worth the wait, there is a patch for the Uncensored VersionGameplay: Typical sense, able to buy items and give them to girls also increase stats. The day system was unique and considerate. Using the Calendar and Stats bring a familiar pace from other games. Kinda reminds me of the unique old dating sims we had in newgrounds. However the game had a nice objective and way to explain how it works. As you help and grow with the team, so do the feelings. Story: Well seeing from S:MOA I believe that this was a nice change of pace. Wish the other characters got their roles in more like an expansion. The development introducing you in the beginning helped show lines connecting EVA and Maray and what she was kinda like. However there are priceless moments as you go along. I feel that in the game there was a definite amount of good time and revision brought to this.Personal Thoughts: Well the 9 was due to the other game and hoping for some involvement however as you play through this game you kind of see a nice pull around from them. I truly enjoyed the idea of running as Vice President and Reliving a life style with an end date to score or be a bore. Maray as a BL fan was hilarious in my opinion. Sola's nature was truly nice. Chigara's story line truly made me think about her a bit more and developed a bit more affection. Asage well I'M THOROUGHLY Surprised. More so that I've grown to accept her Wild Side to be more acceptable. However only thing I kind of wished was like it would go past the whole after you get the girl and in the end you get more CGs and by the graduation year, by all you did, it shows a certain extra bonus CG or events. Nonetheless playing the game over during early access and back now has made me appreciate the characters even more. I truly found this game entertaining and would highly recommend it to many other VN and Dating Sim lovers as well as anime fans. You'll find a nice appeal and to be honest, they did a great job.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Beta Early Access(First Log)Thoughts so far 1/20/15Sola: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER, silent swim club member (Reminds me of Nanasaki Ai and Mana Kawamura). I really do love what you did with her, please continue to do so.Asaga: I have grown to see a Haruhi appeal but has her finer moments. Needs more moments of fun as she is now and some more plot involvement.Chigara: Typical but there was some drama I was not expecting on the route. Need more build up loving the story you created.Maray: PLEASE UNLOCK the Imouto route SOONAva: Okay I admit she has her finer moments here, needs more opening though.Other thoughts:Include the others from Sunrider. I saw a mention of Claude. Please let Kryska, Icari, and the others be there too. Maybe even as a rival school? Chance of that or transfer student.Nonetheless enjoyable work so far and I find it truly great this came to be.  Looking forward for more.			"

												short anwser:If on sale, buy it.If not on sale, don't buy it.why only buy if on sale?- its a grind fest. (not the good kind ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) )- the story lines (routes) are O.K - the writting is O.K- the art is O.K - the whole game just feels O.K, as in not really worth $30- the only thing that is actualky bad is how the routes are handled, it takes a 1/4 of the game for you to even start a route  which in itself is not bad, but the ♥♥♥♥ing grind fest you have to do prior and after this time is just not funoverall 6/10  for no fleet admiral routeJULY 29TH UPDATEIf you like date sim games I'd say this is a decent pick. the game is now $10 and has had the grind aspect toned done significantly (after first playthrough). No story or art has been update/changed and so that still remains, however, I would say that it is worth the price. 8/10 still no sister or dog route			"

												I'm going to give a tentitive recommendation, however there is a severe problem around the second half of the game.... there is almost to do after getting a girlfriend other then time management. Time management is repeditive, boring by itself and as a visual novel this is killing the game.  My suggestion would be having 'friend' path's with the other characters so that the player is dealing with everyone's storyline instead of one person.  The characters are simple but in the beginning of the game at least they interacted with one another, sort of like the other Sunrider game that you have in Beta (btw pick that up as beta its like an extended demo and  FREE).Edit:  Switched to Not Recommended because of the buggy parts of the game destroyed any sort of enjoyment I had left.

Early Access Review
								I beta tested Sunrider, and as a beta tester for Sunrider Academy, I'll let you in on a few things.This is a Full Dating Sim VN, not a Strategy Battle Sim VN like Sunrider. There are no actual battles. This is more on the Novel side of VN's.Enjoyed the hard stratgy-based battle system in Sunrider? Unfortunately, that doesn't happen here.Felt like the characters were missing depth to them? Like it wasn't enough the first time you met them? Well, good news is, this kinda helps satisfy that need, but with a slight adjustment to their lives.Pros: (More) character interraction than in Sunrider itself. More background on each character. Maray is now in the story much more, and is pure hillarity. Jokes...jokes and puns everywhere... Sunrider references! Good soundtrack. Content, content everywhere! It's an alternate unvierse, so technically, none of it is really them, but at the same time, it is. They are just on the same planet and not in space yet. Still enjoyable, but apparently, this is a Con? Why?CONS: It's an alternate unvierse, so technically, none of it is really them, but at the same time, it is. They are just on the same planet and not in space yet. Still enjoyable, but apparently, this is a Con? Why? Can be very repetitive...very repetitive..by Month 5 (half way through), I found the perfect balance to keep my game going perfectly, no chance for a ""bad end"" aka Game Over. It was almost pointless to do that for the next 5 months...so I modded it. Time passes very slowly. Lots of decisions, and if you suck at making decisions/like to see all routes, good luck. It took me a while as well. It takes time to develop the perfect system/balance to keep your game from ending badly, but it is possible, and there will be rough patches. Trial and Error are best.  No art mods allowed so I can't make kenomimi out of the cahracters.A little more:This game is based more around the characters and their personalitites, and...dating them...and maybe get lucky with 1 of the 4 waifu's 3 because Ava doesn't count. Kidding.As a die-hard Chigara fan, I am finding that even Ava has more depth to her and is becoming more of a person than she was in the original game, and I  HATE  Ava (more like, I didn't make a connection with her and can't see her as waifu material).The jokes, puns, and Sunrider references are everywhere, and it adds a lot to the game. If you play this, and you want all the fun from it, play Sunrider until at least the start of Chapter 7.Anything else is up to you. If you want more out of the characters, I suggest you get this game. If you don't like the balance system, mod it like I did. Check my  screenshots  "

												UPDATED: SCRAP EVERYTHING: BUY IT, BUY IT NOWAva's route is the best route. I would recommend you to save it for the last...you know...save the best for last... :D--------------------------------------------------------TL;DR: Don't buy this game if you actually hate calculation OR expect an extremely deep storyline. You lose money, time, and this game gets a down vote....not actually nice or any side. Otherwise, gives this game a try and thumb up if you like.--------------------------------------------------------So, why you may hate this game- Time management: This is probably why many people downvote this game. They find the time management thing stressful and repetitive. It's true that 90% of this game involves time management, but the even on each month are not the same. That being said, different route many have different event also.- Storyline: since this VN focuses heavily on time management, it doesn't have a profound storyline with a bunch of plot twists. However, I think the story is really good, not  excellent, but still god. You can expect a few plot twists and  surprises here and there. Also, if you don't fall into bad end, then the ending is quite satisfied.- Difficulty:....actually...you can always change the difficulty to Waifu, seriously. Hating the game because it's hard...LOL..--------------------------------------------------------Now, why you may love this game (and why I stayed up until 2a.m to play it)- The calculation: I love calculation (Asian). It actually gives me more enjoy,emt tham spending hours and hours looking at the screen. So if you love calculation, you may want to buy it.- The story (again): Although some people may dislike the story, I find it really good. It's quite true and realistic.- The music: I think the music is really nice. I actually like the OP song.- Nice developers: I mean they distribute an official 18+ content patch...- DRM-free: something that benefits the gaming industry in general.			"

												To start, I wouldn't really call this a visual novel, it leans a lot closer to a dating sim.As a a game, it's repetitive, exteremly repetitive. Story: I've completed 2 of the girls arcs and I wasn't impressed by either one. I completed Asaga and Sola. Asaga had some of the most random (writer didn't care) writing. I've played amatuer developed vn's with infinite better writing than her arc. Sola's arc was better, but was nothing amazing. Perhaps the large gaps between the story (having to click and boost states and other mindless sim stuff) interruptted the story to make me care less, but something wasn't right.Gameplay: repetitve, but it is a sim game. Stats could be easily broken in the game where you just don't care anymore.CG: you can download an Hpatch if you want, id recommended it for the plot (there is actual character development in the Hscences) for wrist workout material they're sub par.Characters: For everything else i didn't like in the game, I did like my character (my PC), better than any character i've ever played in any other vn. The girls are all decent, i didn't hate any of them.Soundtrack: repetitive and nothing amazingThe characters are the strongest thing going for this game, but the writing was lazy and the sim portion of the game interrupted the story with boring repetitive tasks. The begining of the game is fairly strong, but by the end of month 7 or 8 (10 months in the game with 5 days each), you just want to be done.			"

												While I do recommend this, I must admit that the game leaves mixed impression.For TL;DR scroll to the end.Bad things first, since there is not that many of them.My biggest problem with this game is that it fails as a time manager. The grind is tedious and completely pointless. Most of the stats have little to no impact on the game. And this grind occupies a HUGE portion of the game, which would otherwise be quite short.The experience would be much better overall if the game featured 5-6 short stories traditional VN way with branching depending on action/dialogue choices. I say short because that's how it would be without all the grind the player is asked to go through. If the developers spent the time they spent on producing timemanager for this game on actual writing, the game would only benefit from thatm even if the increase in amount of text would be slight.To conclude on bad things: the game fails to combine VN/eroge with timemanager.Now good things.- First, the game has very decent visual representation. Both sprites and backgrounds while not artisticaly exquisite (not that I really expect that from an eroge), but good nontheless. Good resolution, you can run it fullscreen without risk of suffering eye bleeding. Drawing style is always a matter of personal preference, but I personally liked it. It's detailed euough, even if not very complex.- Second, the game has a very likeable opening, some effort (or money) was definitely put in making it. - Third, soundtrack is good enough. Mostly light-hearted themes, with appropriate mood changes to be in line with the story development. It will get repeatative overtime, like on 15+ hours, but that's not it's fault, but the fault of timemanager (yet again)-Fourth. Very important thing. The developer provides restoration patch on their official site with no additional charge.That's the way to do it, my friends. Steam policies are one thing, but the players should be given an acces to full experience if they so choose. Love in space did it right. Great respect.Next points are a matter of personal view, I place them both on a PLUS side.-Characters. I didn't expect really deep characters portrayal in a casual game to begin with. They are OK if you share the same approach. If you expect deep personalities, with complex problems, well, you will probably be disappointed. I do love to see ""deep"" characters, but this is just not a place to look for them.They are cute, with some touch of individuality and represent differend moods and temperaments. That's all, measure that to your expectations.-The game isn't taking itself too seriously. It is light-hearted, self-ironic, laughs at the cliches it uses, Good thing for a casual game, could be a bad thing for something more serious.TL;DR:PLUS-good visuals-very nice opening-decent sound-cute girls-official restoration patch that is immediately available from the developer if you need itMINUS-the game fails to combine time management aspect with eroge, it would be better without a timemanager at all, even if that would make the game significantly shorterConclusion:Simple, but pleasant experience, that for me was NOT ruined despite absolutely unncecessary grind of poorly implemented timemanager.Actually, in this particular case I'm willing to pay for a DLC that would cut the damn timemanager out, add another 50% of text and turn the Sunrider Academy into a short traditional VN/eroge with actual choices and story branching instead of grind.Looking forward to new eroge/VN from Love In Space if they decide to make some. Maybe something more serious this time? Just PLEASE, don't include timemanagers if you're not planning to flesh them out properly. "

												Sunrider Academy is a dating simulator game, combines with a management game and added a lil nudes spices into it. It's a spin-off game from ""Sunrider"" franchise. If you want to see the true ""Sunrider,"" go play ""Sunrider : Mask of Arcadius,"" or ""Sunrider : Liberation Day - Captain's Edition.""First, I'm just gonna start my review with my own experience by playing this game. This is my first dating simulator game (and my first eroge, too.) When I first saw this game at Steam I was like, ""alright, why don't I give it a try?"" So I bought it only for $2 at summer sale. I thought this was an ordinary dating sim, but boy was I wrong.This game takes place in an another universe, in another planet called ""Cera."" You lived in a capital city in that planet, called ""Cera City."" In Cera, there's only 10 months in a year, in a month there's 5 weeks, in a week there's 10 days, in a day there's 10 hours, in an hour there's 100 mins, and in a min there's 100 secs. Pretty interesting universe I gotta say.You play as Kayto Shields, a male student who studied at your 3rd grade in a school (or campus) called ""Sunrider Academy."" You had a lil sister, Maray Shields, who forced you to get a girlfriend by the end of the year. You work as a Vice-President of a student council in that school, who led by Ava, your childhood friend. As a vice-president, you have to organized 3 problematic clubs, such as the Kendo Club, the Science Club, and the Swimming Club. If you fail to fulfill the orders, you'll get a bad ending. So, try to do your best organizing those clubs.There are 4 girls that you can chose who to date with, such as Asaga (the Kendo Club captain), Chigara (the Science Club leader), Sola (the Swimming Club captain), and Ava (your childhood friend). You need patient to date one of those girls, cause its not gonna start soon. Do your best to date one of those girls.In the meantime, you'll get some conflicts who will spice the game a lil bit, such as competitions, exams, stresses, and even one of the girls conflicts. Winning a competition will give you prestiges. If you failed to get the prestige goal every month, its game over for ya. Try your best to organize your clubs, study times, and stresses.I've finally finished a route in 12+ hours. Its really amazing how they can make a really complicated history, but actually its not that complicated to understand. There's some conflicts on the way, I even got stressed because of my stress in the game.Here's some of my reviews according to my gameplay experience about the girls that I've met in this game :1. Asaga = Asaga is a cheerful and energetic girl with a side twintail red hair. She can be pretty funny and so dumb at some times. If you play her arc, you'll get a lot of sex jokes, trust me.2. Chigara = Chigara is a shy girl with a blue hair, and a red ribbon on top of her head. She can be pretty energetic, but can feel so down, too. She's sometimes optimistic, but sometimes pesimistic, too. If you play her arc, you'll know something valuable about Chigara  and a lil bit ♥♥♥♥ed up as well .3. Ava = As your childhood friend, Ava has a straight black hair. She's really strict about rules and law. She'll get mad at you if you don't do your duty properly. She's also a very responsible girl. She won't leave until the job is finished.4. Sola = Sola is a quiet girl, a really quiet girl, with a white hair and almost no expression shown on her face at the first time you met her, but it will change as time goes by. Her backstory is really mindblowing. If you want to know a lot about the history of Cera, I recommend to play her arc first. Sola will mention a lot of it.If I have to choose which arc/route to be my favorite one, I'd choose Sola's route. It was really fascinating to play souch route. The story's really awesome, I gotta say the best from all of them. I like Chigara's route, too, but I prefer Sola's to be my favorite.My first route is Sola's route. And boy, I cried like a lil ♥♥♥♥♥ because of it. It was a really nice experience playing that route.My favorite thing about this game is the story. Its really awesome to play and its easy to understand how the story goes. The music in this game is really soothing, too. The artwork? Don't even ask about it, because the artwork is really awesome.I cried, I laughed, I grinned, I smiled in this game. It was a joyful experience playing this game. I totally love this game.Every game has its own plus and minus. I already mentioned the plus, now I'm gonna mention the minus. The thing that I found didn't really like in this game is the sudden erotic scenes. I can't say that I didn't enjoy all those erotic scenes, its just funny when you're in a normal conversation, but suddenly turns out you're gonna have sex with the girl you date (of course, it will only happened if you play with the Denpasoft Patch.)One more thing, this game is  CENSORED  by Steam. You can go to the official website to download the 18+ patch for this game. I played it with the patch, of course. Because I appreciate the original work. so I played it with the patch. I did not expect such scene, but to be honest, it wasn't that bad.If you wanted to feel some emotions and read an amazing story, this game's for you. But, I gotta warn you something. Play it cool, don't let your in-game stress became too much, because you can ended up as myself, who get stressed by the in-game stress. I'll give my rating to this game as 9,9/10.			"

												I initially bought this game just to support the development of the next entry in the sunrider saga (Liberation Day) and to show my appreciation for the superb Mask of Arcadius, I expected to find a classic visual novel with a bit of management elements, like a lot of the visual novels out there, but I found something completely different.To me it was a nice game but it has some flaws that might turn off some people.Let me warn you: this game is a hard mangement sim with some vn/dating sim components and it's not something you can finish quickly and without some strategy (unless you play at waifu mode): it's not for everyone, but it's cool!For a Sunrider player:This game is set in an alternate universe, it doesn't add anything to the existing main story but it gives you a nice ""what if scenario"" with the possibility to know better some characters and their personality, however they are not exactly the same girls you remember as their personality quirks have been accentuated (like chigara being ultra-shy or asaga way too dumb) but the overall vn part is average at best.There are a ton of easter eggs and references to the main game, maybe even too much, to the point where you kinda want to close the game and play the main one at times since they keep reminding you of that.For a new player:This game is a hard management game, if you want a vn this probably isn't the game for you, if you're curious and are into strategy/management games I suggest you to try playing Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius (it's free) before committing to buying this.It's not required to have played the original game, since this is an alternate universe, but there are tons of references that are fun to find and the vn part is just plain and already knowing the characters might make it a bit more interesting.In Sunrider Academy you play the role of the Student Council vice-president and you experience the whole school year from the first day to graduation and you get assigned 3 problematic clubs to supervise and to guide to success.The game consists in a series of choices on how to spend your day, you'll have to decide which stat you want to train and what club you want to help everyday while keeping your stress low, it reminds me of a less polished Long Live The Queen.The coolest simple thing is the calendar, which is a great way to know months in advance when you have tests or club tournaments and allows you to carefully plan everything to reach a certain date and be ready for a particular event: you'll never be caught by surprise if you check on it regularly.Unfortunately having to follow a schedule for so many days becomes quickly repetitive, and the possibility to fail activities and the stats loss during sleep may make it a bit frustrating (even if it's possible to save and reload before performing any activity if you wish) but it feels very rewarding when everything goes according to plan and you score high in a test or win in a competition.The visuals and sound are good, you can see the improvements in the character design compared to mask of arcadius and the characters look way better. Achievement are average, but the 400 visits ones are too annoying.Ok, it's a hard and punishing game, but what are the real cons of the game? Mainly two.1-The visual novel dating part is pretty weak, the story is nothing special and the only gameplay consist in guessing what place to visit in certain weeks and picking the right conversation topic when you meet a girl randomly.2-The lack of a clear explanation of the stats: there is no explanation whatsoever to what a stat does and you'll be guessing a lot, sometimes it's pretty obvious, like intelligence is needed to score high at tests, but then for example there is an election where charisma is strangely useless.So, in short:+ An extra look into the sunrider universe+ Challenging, but rewarding+ 5 difficulties+ There are not many games like this on steam- Repetitive- The visual novel part is just average- No good explanation on stats (you'll have to check the guides on steam)Overall I recommend this game, but I think you should buy this as a management game and you'll have fun, and if you like this kind of games, check out Long Live the Queen too.
