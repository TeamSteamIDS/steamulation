What is it?Train Valley is a casual game where you must lay tracks to connect multiple stations to each other, and route trains without crashes or delays with the goal of sending trains to the correct station marked by a coloured flag.  It's not a tycoon or serious transport management sim and there is no cargo or passenger quota to manage.  It's more a strategy/puzzle type of game that challenges you to meet a set of goals before time or money run out.What's to like about it?It's silly in a fun way as the difficulty ramps up and you find yourself frantically clicking switches in the hope of avoiding crashes or wrongly-routed trains.  Some trains are faster and longer than others and it soon becomes manic.  Don't even think of trying a delaying tactic!  Keep a train waiting long enough and it will release itself whether you're ready or not!  The tutorial is somewhat scant but the game is intuitive to play with a simple interface.  You are not automatically thrown out of the game if you suffer a collision (luckily) though your profits take a hit and you'll probably need to do some track repairs.  You are given a set of objectives to meet for each location - of increasing difficulty with a greater number of stations to be served.What's not to like?Quite honestly, not much.  At first, it feels a bit TOO casual (ie Facebook style) but as the difficulty and number of stations ramp up, the game becomes a real challenge of strategy and timing.  The graphics are somewhat muddy and aliased (no in-game options to correct this).   Station colours can be a bit obscured by train flags at times when there are a lot of things going on, and a couple of colours are a little too similar which adds unnecessarily to the level of difficulty (for example: the orange and yellow station colours look very similar).  These are all minor gripes however, and don't detract from the fun of the game.In summary...Train Valley is no 'Sid Meier' or other type of management or tycoon sim, but it's a fun and addictive little game easily worth its low price.  Recommended!			"

												I don't play tower defence games anymore, because I have this game instead. If you don't see the appeal to tower defence at all, this game is not for you. If you've got the tower defence itch, this game will scratch it until it bleeds.This game doesn't have an undo button, so push your luck too far and it's game over. I know why that would put some people off, but it works for this game.Why is this better than tower defence? In any good tower defence game, getting good at it means learning how the towers work and how each enemy type works. Once you've figured that out, there's not much left to learn or do.With this game, the trains behave the same way (at different speeds) and the track laying rules are intuitive. Will you overpopulate your grid with trains to build up money, or will you play it safer with collissions, but risk facing bankruptcy? Can you time them perfectly so they almost hit but don't? What is the best configuration for the tracks? Is it worth paying extra to demolish your way through a shortcut? These dilemmas you get to face from game 1, without having to remember what does what.There is only one change I would make to this game if I were the developer, and that is this: When the game is paused, I want to still be able to see which trains are going full speed and which trains have only started moving. As a father, I love a game that I can pause and come back to after a nappy change, but I often forget which trains are going full speed and which are not by the time I return.			"

												A seaming simple yet very addictive little puzzle game, I'd already sunk 10 over hours into this before it left early access.Some of the levels and layouts can be surprisingly challenging, especially if you are trying to complete all the objectives. Fortunately if needed you can play each level as many times as you like completeing 1 objective each time to earn your stamps! The devs seemed to have solved most of the problems with layout, UI, bugs etc before it left early access, so all in all it's a good buy if you're looking for a simple puzzle game to kill an hour or so at a time.Just understand, this is NOT an in depth train simulator, it's a puzzle game with a train theme.

												This is not a train building management game, as some of the descriptions/images would lead you to believe. It is actually a puzzle game with many different levels. If you enjoy puzzle games then you might like this, but I was expecting a railroad/resource management simulation, which is not what I got.			"

												Despite what you may think looking at the store page, this is more of a straight-up railroading puzzle game and less of a management sim, although it does a decent job of simulating a rail network. It's quite a good game too: fun, challenging and pretty to boot.However, I have to say that Train Valley reminds me of an older train puzzle game, one near and dear to my heart: 3D Ultra Lionel TrainTown[www.xtcabandonware.com], developed in 2000 by Dynamix. Whereas that game focused on completing missions and solving puzzles, in Train Valley your main goal is to simply survive until the end of a level without going bankrupt, although completing side goals earns you stamps of recognition. Train Valley has players reenact a more realistic depiction of railroading history - although it's mainly in the background - all the while attempting to stay afloat and expand to meet the needs of industry. Players take the role of a trainmaster, which means sending and routing trains to their intended destination.TrainTown has you manually hauling freight such as ore to smelters, hamburgers to grills, or numbers to multiplication equations. It plays its Lionel model train aesthetic to the hilt and is definitely ""wackier"", if you're into that sort of thing. Controlling multiple locomotives at the same time is only really needed in the later levels; although it's possible in every level, you'll usually only need to control one train at a time in the early game.In TrainTown, one crash fails a level, and some of those levels were as complex as any you may find in Train Valley. I mean, if the first set of levels was intended for elementary school kids, the last set was probably meant for college sophomores. I feel comfortable in saying TrainTown is harder, but oh so satisfying to play as well.I know this is a recommendation for Train Valley, which I absolutely recommend for puzzle and train fans, but if you like it I'd say you should give TrainTown a shot too. It's more or less abandonware at this point anyway, no harm in trying it.			"

Disclaimer: the key was provided to me for reviewingTrain Valley is a real time puzzle-strategy game based on trains and railroads. The player connects train stations and makes sure trains reach their correct destination by changing switches on the railroad he/she build himself/herself.The game has a nice simplistic menu that is shaped as a stockbook (book that is used by stamp collectors). Every Postage stamp in it is a level of the game. There are 20 levels total. The game has two game modes. One of them is classic mode which consist of levels that has a time and money limit, and also have optional objectives. The other mode is sandbox. As the name suggests, there are no restrictions and limits. Also in this mode, the player decides stations’ spawn time and when a train is scheduled from a station. At the beginning, all levels except the first one is locked. New levels are opened by beating the previous level. To play sandbox version of a level, the player needs to beat the same level in classic mode.First level is a tutorial level that shows basics of the game. Although it shows the most important parts of the game with nice message boxes, other parts are only mentioned in small bubbles that can be easily missed. Luckily, game is very simple and can be learned in a few games. That said, it would be nice to have a better tutorial.A level starts with two stations. Player is given some money to build railroads. After that trains start to be scheduled. When such train is scheduled, an icon appears on the station it is in. Then player starts the train by simply clicking it. That said, it is not possible to make a train wait forever. After an unknown time, it starts to count down from 5 and moves when the countdown reaches zero. As time passes, more stations are spawned making the game and railroad network more complicated. That said, it will never be too complicated as a tycoon but has its challenges of its own.Origin and destination of a train is handled very nicely in the game. It is color coded. Every train and station has a color on it. And the purpose is to make a train reach the station with the same color. When the train reaches its destination, the player gets the money. Amount of money is determined at the time of the spawn of a train. After that it will start decreasing even if the train is still in the starting station. This game is not a detailed tycoon game. It is designed as a puzzle-strategy game. The main purpose of the game in a level is not to bankrupt, but in this game, “bankrupt” means “negative money”. There are no loans, no maintenance cost, no economy. The player earns money by making a train reach its correct destination. After that he/she uses the money to build railroads to connect newly spawned stations. Every game year, a constant tax is debited from the money. There are only two ways the player’s money goes below zero; tax and train crash. As soon as the player’s money is negative, he/she loses. This mechanic is the games strategy part.The puzzle part is more interesting. Because the actual puzzle is built by the player without him/her realizing. After connecting a few stations with railroads, railroads become a (simple) maze with switches left and right. More stations mean more railroads with more switches. It is never possible to create a network without switches because of either landscape or money constraints. Towards the end of a level, the player keeps clicking switches to send the trains to correct road and prevent crashes. This is the most fun part of the game.Sounds in the game is nice and relaxing but it would be better to have a few different sound tracks.Total game length is a bit short. There are 20 levels but if the player doesn’t care about optional objectives, then they will end quickly.Pros:+ Simplistic: All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.+ Relaxing: Because it is simple and lacks ambition, it is fit to be played just to relax.Cons:- Short: Don’t have many levels.Verdict:Train valley is a nice and relaxing game. It gives the feeling of playing actual toy trains and if you like trains, you probably will like this game. That said, because it is short, I recommend it to be best considered as a side game when you got bored of other stuff.P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupEdit: Fixed some typos and formatting "

												No, I don't personally like nor recommend Train Valley but oh boy does my wife play the crap out of it. Moral of the story: this game definately appeals to some folks in a serious way.Essentially, this title is a pure puzzle game - the train part is just a skin. If you are here because you like trains, do yourself a favor and see yourself out now. If you like puzzles in the same vein as Mini Metro, keep reading. You build tracks, and tell trains when to stop and start all while helping them get to their destination. As you play a level (which can be completely seen on one screen), a few new hubs pop up as time goes on. There are three goals per level, which each earn you a stamp in your train book. You manage money, to a certain extent. This game is difficult, so beware.Why don't I like it? Well I find it incredibly tedious to juggle everything in my head, and often, one mistake makes you totally want to start over. Whether it was because you missed out on a stamp/goal, or because it ruined the flow of your play. I also think the track laying mechanic/controls could be substantially better. Yeah, you get used to it after a couple of hours, but c'mon this isn't rocket science.Pros:+Although it can be quite difficult, this feels and plays like a zen puzzler; definately charming+Music is great - BUT man they need to put some dead air in there sometimes - it's on a constant loop and you will start to go nuts after an hour or so+Easy to learn, very difficult to masterCons:-Out of all the puzzle games I've played, I don't really find this all that addicting, personally-Music is great - BUT man they need to put some dead air in there sometimes - it's on a constant loop and you will start to go nuts after an hour or so-No controller supportIt's certainly a niche game. If you find yourself intrigued still, I'd go for it. "

												I've been looking for something to scratch the Transport / Railroad Tycoon itch for a while now, and although there are some potentially promising games on the horizon, it seemed like there were no good examples in the genre at the moment.And then I stumbled upon Train Valley, which, within a few minutes of playing confirms that the above is true - this isn't a tycoon game.  What it is, is a puzzle game - and once you get a few levels in, it's fiendish.  It conjurs up the correct mix of raising a smile when things go to plan, and swearing at your screen when you get overwhelmed and the inevitable happens - and trains crash.The premise is simple; you are given a grid and two coloured stations on each map, and you drag lines from one to the other, avoiding or bulldozing (at a cost) your way through buildings and trees, some of which are randomly placed whilst some are always in the same place.  Trains will spawn in the stations with a colour indicating that they want you to direct them to the other station, you click to launch the train and it makes its way down the track and you get paid when it arrives - each train has a value which ticks down from the moment it spawns to the moment it arrives at the destination.  The complexity comes in as the map progresses.  New stations will spawn on the map - in predetermined positions but in a random order, and begin to spawn trains all eager to go somewhere else.  You will lay more tracks, launch trains, and use the track switches to try and avoid a catastrophe.  Fortunately you can stop and reverse trains, but this doesn't always help if you're not keeping a good watch out - only one train can occupy a station, so it will launch itself if a second one is about to spawn.The difficultly ramps up; early maps serve to teach you the basics and later ones cram stations in awkward places with choke points to force trains onto the same pieces of track.  When things go well, it's great - but sometimes, you just can't avoid an explosion.Back to my search for a tycoon game - even though this clearly isn't one, the art style and simple way of laying track would lend itself very well to a more in depth strategy game which, if I were the developer, I'd seriously consider.

												Ok, let's get over the misconception first: No matter what the dumb user defined tags say, this is not a sim. This is an active puzzle game, that just happens to involve trains. That having been said, it does combine two of my favorite things, trains games and puzzle games. I never thought that I'd somehow have 30 hours in the game, it's something that I just kept on coming back to, having this need to finish all three stamps on all maps, including the DLC.Personally I love the fact that there's a speed function that lets me play fast and just pause when I need to, it makes for a super great challenge (until they put in no pausing as a stamp requirement in the new DLC that made me sad).I personally experienced no crashes of any sort, only in the DLC did I have a bit of a bug where the main menu wouldn't pop up if I hit escape, which was basically just a trifling annoyance. To sum it up: I love finding little unknown games like this which I end up enjoying way more than I ever thought I would, and I'm highly looking forward to future DLC!			"

												First, and most importantly-- This is a puzzle game revolving around managing increasingly complex train lines and switches. This is NOT a railroad tycoon game. Mini Metro would be a closer analogy, though the two games are quite different.It starts off simply as you route slow moving trains between a small number of stations. The difficulty ramps up considerably with an increase in train speeds/types, station quanities, difficult terrain, and challenging secondary objectives. (IE, Don't allow trains to arrive at the wrong station, no pausing, Dispatch X additional trains, etc...) Highly recommended for train and/or puzzle fans.			"

												Looking at Train Valley's (TV) store page a while back, I overlooked this game as a basic train simulator, when in fact it plays more of a puzzle game with some real-time strategy elements thrown in! TV uses some fairly simple but effective rules. Lay a track between stations, and deliver as many trains without incident, as quickly as possible. You can choose where to lay the track, purchased from the earnings you get from train deliveries, and trigger when the trains depart. These are colour coded to let you know where to send the train. You can also rush trains by purchasing them for bonus score & turn trains around or stop them.  Your money is always going down so the pressure is on!Where tracks overlap, you have get a switchboard, that you can reposition between your alternative track paths. On complex track layouts, this can be quite challenging to keep every train going where they should especially when you start to juggle multiple trains enroute at a single time. Good planning is a must!Puzzle mechanics are easy, but increase exponentially as paths multiply. As you progress through the 20 scenarios (+5 more in the DLC) across 4 seasons, the difficulty is increased by putting more obstacles in your way, increasing the frequency of the trains & also other level specific challenges. Each level has 3 bonus goals to achieve as well, which can be done on multiple playthroughs. When things get too hectic, you can pause the timer giving you a moment to regroup. Although the maps are small, there is ample variety in the challenges presented, they are thoughfully designed, balanced & do not become stale.Sound design is good, providing clear audio feedback to the actions occurring on screen, but these can get repetitive (especially the ding of the train leaving for me). Levels are clear to navigate and laying track is generally an easy task. Occasionally, you can lay a track as your mouse moves slightly to the adjacent square, causing issues laying things the wrong way. It would be good to be able to demolish for the same cost if the timer hasn't been resumed to recover costs (as income is limited).Likewise, the financial impact of two trains colliding plus the many squares of track loss often spells doom & essentially the end for your level. It seems a bit excessive at times, and can frustrate, as can that random train departure who has just got in the way of everything! Thankfully, most levels are pretty quick to balance this out to a degree.Despite these stress points, it has been hard to drag myself away from TV for very long. Still trying to beat some of the later levels in the German DLC. It is highly addictive once you get a few levels in and will continue to challenge your time management & coordination skills all the way to the last level.If you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!

												Train Valley is a surprisingly good title for not a whole lot of money. You just need to have the right expectations.This is no ecosim, it's a light puzzler with trains. Your goal is to connect the different train yards, of which more will pop up during any given scenario (always in the same place, but at possibly different times each time you retry the level, i.e. upper right instead of lower left and vice versa). Your only tool are tracks and demolition. This is complicated by the terrain and already present tiles with buildings, etc. on them, which makes construction a lot more expensive if you want/need to go through instead of around. After that it's ""simply"" a matter of sending out trains to the correct stations by manipulation of the railroad switches and avoiding crashes. Easier said than done sometimes.Trains will ""spawn"" after a set amount of time (indicated in the bottom right) and automatically leave the station if all stations have spawned trains already (i.e. you were either sleeping or you spawned extra trains and couldn't get them out in time). This can have dire consequences. The longer a train waits and travels the more of its monetary value it will lose. Since the game deducts a yearly fee (and the year goes by very quickly) you can end up bankrupt thus forfeiting the level completely, which means restarting from the very beginning, since there are no check points nor is manual saving a thing.Add to that 3 different bonus goals (fixed) for each level (spawn x additional trains, earn x amount of money, don't let a train go to the wrong station, don't press pause, etc.) and the game can become quite hectic, despite the availability of a pause feature. It is still easy to misjudge a train's speed though and send out the next too early, so they crash. The switches get out of hand in later levels, so mistakes are easily made, especially since any train going over a switch that does not have to be changed automatically aligns it as well, which can spell trouble for the following train if you're not on your guard.Crashes are pretty bad most of the time since they not only mean the train and money is lost forever, but you also have to rebuild the tracks, meaning even more money is lost. You could easily go bankrupt until the next train reaches its destination. However, you can stop a train and even turn it around at almost any given time, but of course this has other negative effects like loss of money and time.If you like a challenge or want to speed things up, you can do so by up to 4 times the regular speed (2x and 4x speed). Do not press the pause button and see if you can survive ;)The DLC ""Germany"" adds a new chapter to Europe, America, Russia and Japan, complete with new trains, new hazards and new music. Every region in the game features its own soundtrack and some levels have interesting hazards to play around with, for example unstoppable speed trains, or even bombing runs. Well worth it in my opinion.			"

												A perfect crossover between Pipe Dream and Flight Control HD.You layout rails to bring a constant flow of trains to their designated stations. Very easy concept but gets hectic as more stations spawn around the map and the train numbers increase.Each train you deliver will increase your money to build more tracks, and pay the taxes each year (which is very short in game time!). Trains lose worth fast, so don't deliver them fast and you risk going bankrupt.You can also launch extra trains at a random location for a fee. Gamble on this option to increase your cash, but abuse it and you'll end up overloading your network which is certain to lead to disaster, or to fun!Once you have multiple trains running between stations you'll need to micromanage switches and stop your trains if necessary (losing precious money) to avoid accidents which will always make your trains blow up violently; I think it must be explosives that you are delivering.You can play the levels in a variety of styles. Spend loads of cash to build a huge rail network which can support loads of trains running at the same time. Or play it stingy and try to see how many trains you manage to circulate back and forth on a single narrow piece of track. Both methods have their risks and rewards.Some of the later maps have special features, such as high speed trains that you cant control or stop, adding to the excitement.The campaign is not extremely long, but you have sandbox levels at the end of each stage, and stamp challenges on each level also increase replayability. This can make some easy levels very challenging, for example play the level without using pause, without stopping any train, and launch 10 additional trains.The game runs smooth and seamlesly performance wise, and hardly has any bugs. There are 4 (5 with DLC) countries which all have a pleasant and unique visual style, and the trains have some nice variety from around the world. You can see that the devs like their trains, even though this is a puzzle game, not a tycoon one.Also the game still receives attention from the devs, patches, and DLC. At the really honest price tag this is sold I can not do anything but recommend Train Valley to everyone!			"

												Bought it, played five hours in one session right away. So I guess that's good.It is not a classic ""Tycoon"" game, as you might have figured out from the screenshot, more like a halfway point of that and a puzzle game like, say, Air Control. Which is good! The levels really change up the core gameplay of ""somehow get a bunch of trains from A to B without them all crashing into each other"" in some interesting ways, and some of the Russian and Japanese levels require LOTS of concentration.I would say I had more fun with this than with many of the ""real"" railway management sims. Two things, though:* I'd like to have more content. There's enough right now to justify the price point, but after going through most of the levels, I'd still like to go on. So give me some DLC and I'll buy that stuff.* There are still some glitches, which also occasionally forced me to restart levels. It is annoying as hell, but because I like the core gameplay so much, I can still recommend it. I hope there will be improvements, though. (EDIT: Yay, there have been indeed.)			"

												In a way, this is a sort of real-time puzzle game, not unlike Tetris. You lay a finite amount of track, attempt to make the best use of the limited space to deliver the most trains in the shortest time, and revise your track configuration as necessary.The satisfaction of finding the right configuration is hard to describe. Let me put it this way: If you're the type of person who likes optimizing processes, such that an unexpectedly high workload can still be managed with nothing going wrong, you will find much to like in this game.It is a heuristics development and revision game where learning the optimal layout for each situation is half the fun, and the other half is guiding trains through that layout with nothing exploding.Though it usually has little bearing on gameplay, I should also say that this game uses locations and times from history rarely seen in videogames, especially the DLC.

												Good idea, and it's fun when it works. But the game has a few major flaws that makes it incredibly frustrating. There is a timer that appears only when there are 5 seconds left before the next train. If you have anything in that range, there's very little you can do especially when the levels are complex. I've also had tracks explode after a train runs into a mountain, even though the track is green when I place it. Further, I've had objects destroy tracks when they sprout from the ground.I was enjoying the game for a while, but the glitches and train management is just far too frustrating for complex levels. I can't recommend the game until the developer fixes these issues, and revamps some of the track management.			"

												Train Valley is a great game if you get really into it. It can be stressing but most of the time it's quite relaxing and if you love management and have some overview skills it's great for you! And one of the best things is that you actually learn managing and keeping your head cool in panicky moments. Pro's;*Challenging*Not boring at all*Keeps you playing*Very funCons;*Graphics are not optimized (But this can be a good thing if you don't have one of the best computers in the world)*You're going to lose a lot of time ;)But I warn you! Once you start the game with the thought ""I'm going to play a little bit"" it's not a little bit, but like a few hours. Great game! 9/10			"

												This is a neat little game! Many train games are focused on the driving, speed, and so on. The game here is more equivalent to a model train set, wherein your responsibility is designing the layout of the railroad network and dispatching trains to their appropriate destinations. I've played through about 12 levels so far and many have posed a great challenge for me! But there is not a moment that I am not having fun. The background music can quickly get a bit repetitive, so I would recommend turning that off after a little while. Once I completely play through the game, I plan to go back again and ensure I pass all of the levels _with_ the bonus objectives.All in all this is a great game. It requires careful planning, precision execution, and a computer with only decent spects.			"

												How can someone not recommend this game!If you ever wanted to know what it is like having your own trainset at home but spending all that cash held you back? Than this is your game.It is a addicting management gameand when all your trains are moving on that perfectly thought out track.You feel like a boss.However when things turn into chaos, you will give curse yourself.There aren't really any negatives besides one annoyance which is the difficulty of drawing the tracks. Sometimes it is hard to guide them where you want them to go.			"

												Train Valley has a simple premise. Bring Trains from one Station to another. But what the game makes out of this relatively simple premise is astonish. Why? Let me explain!GameplayIt all starts slow. Two Stations. One Train. The Interface is very intuitive and you will understand every function in absolutely no time. Of course the first mission is also a tutorial, so you will have no problem to get into the game mechanics. The game offers four chapters with six missions each. Also every mission has 3 “Expert goals” you can try to fulfill. These will change the way you play the mission, what is a motivation to play it again and reach them. But the final goal in every mission is the same. Get every Train that will spawn to their desired station without going bankrupt.Bankrupt? Yes! Every train as a certain value assigned. As longer as the train needs to reach its destination it loses value over time till it is at $0. After the first two missions the difficult raises pretty quickly, but the Missions are never getting unfair. You will have the motivation to try it again and never have the feeling that you lost because the mission design was unfair. ProgrammingI had no crash in my whole play time or any stutters. The game ran smooth at any given moment. Pros-Motivating Gameplay-Good tutorials-It’s very easy to get into the game-Motivating extra goals in each mission-Two game modes. Classic and FreeplayCons-Difficult raises pretty fast-The final mission goal is always the sameFinal thoughtsI found this game only because Steam suggested it to me, and I am really glad about it. Train Valley really took me by surprise. At any time I was motivated to beat the actuall mission and reach as many bonus goals as I could. And when I failed I could see why I did. The price it okay for what you get. Even if you just play through it without playing for the Expert Goals you will need some hours till you beat the final mission. Even if you never played such a game, like I did, I can still recommend this to you if the screenshots and the trailer appeal to you.			"

												Fun little game, really challenging too if ur like me and want to get the best score in each level it gets pretty hard and sometimes just really makes u almost wanna rage quit :P, but yeah im really enjoying the game love trains and this is a fun game with trains in it :D! Really worth buying, levels are challenging and fun to play, scenery of the levels is beautiful too look at, train desings are pretty cool too its fun that they have multiple train designs and not just one boring train who goes on every track. The game also has a sandbox mode haven't used it myself but there are probably some people who might find that fun too :)! Im just going to stick to the challenge mode :)!9/10 Worth buying if u like trains :)!Edit: Forgot to mention that this game also has different Timestamps so like for example the first few levels are like from the 1800s and the more you progress the further you get with the time, also the game has different enviroments so ur not really sticking to one place for the whole of the game, no they actually take you through alot of continents so for example the first few levels are based in countries in Europe so after you complete those levels, the next continent will be America and so on, it doesn't STICK with one level design throughout the whole game it actually CHANGES from designs, trains, continents and even countries which makes this a fun little game :)! WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!!!			"

								   There is no casual train management strategy game quite like Train Valley.  Explore new worlds and learn the rail management skills to build, manage, and rule your great rail empire.  No train enthusiast on a budget can go without this game. There are a few kinks (i.e. buildings spawning on laid tracks and trains spontaeously exploding for no reason) but they are so rare or predicatable you can adapt to your situation.  I am proud to say I had the privelege to enjoy this game from early developement, and you can witness that experience for yourself in my let's play from the earliest alpha release to the most recent patch (a7.4/beta1.0 at this period) here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLq7fziG4I2WvsbCzGsxICVvHoK4CpOiuqI personally want to thank Flazm.com and Oroboro Games for the fantastic experience they provided me and cannot wait for the next patch.  There is so much more to experience!Advice for new users:-the bell, whistle or horn sound a locomotive makes leaving a station in this patch gives you a cue of how fast it will go regardless of what it looks like (mid or late 19th century steam, 20th century steam, early diesel, modern diesel)-the grid matrix in build mode is your friend; drag your cursor from a place that has track wherever you want, just be sure you are aware of how you drag your mouse cursor-dirt roads on game maps give you a hint about how to configure your tracks-compact triangular swicthing junctions are essential for saving money and space, crosing tracks are not-plot your track configuations while the game is paused to be safe (or don't for an extra challenge) :3-train crashes require track replacement at the point of impact (unless the impact point is in a station)-don't leave a train sitting in a station sitting for too long; it will eventually leave -consider in game annual taxes paid each new year before building or adding more trains (which both cost money)-trains going into the wrong station will go straight in and swing back out instantly, so be careful-avoid building over existing map strutures to save more money where reasonable-game logic prevents trains from derailling on switches regardless of which way they are oriented-building new tracks under existin tracks with trains still running on them will cause derailments (game logic won't save you here) -enjoy yourselfP.S. (Please don't throw rocks at me for sounding like a brown-noser, I just like this game a lot.) "

												Train Valley is a nice game if you like trains and micro managing switches.Because this is 100% what this game is about.Also it has a demo, which is rare enough.The tutorial and the demo (which include the tuto + 2 levels) already shows you 100% of the gameplay.Bear in mind that all other levels are just ""more of the same"".So you goal is to build a railway (with switches all over the place) so that trains of a given color (there is a proper color-blind mode but all trains and stations have symbols, in addition to the color) reaches the stations of the matching color as fast as possible without bumping in other trains and without runing out of money.The longer it take a train to reach a station, the fewer money it earns you.Laying tracks cost money, with a penalty when you destroy something that already exist (house/tree).Each year passing by also cost you a maintenance fee.Each levels have three optionnal objectives, the real one is just no to run out of money.Completing the objectives by the end of the level (which have a predetermined duration) will earn you stamps.Even if it is easy not to run out of money, earning all the stamps is quite challenging. and will require you to restart some missions multiple times.The game has 24 missions, divided in 4 seasons which only slighly change the looks of the levels (they are themed Europe, USA, Russia and Japon).All levels are of the same size : super tiny, which is challenging and frustrating at the same time...I wish there were bigger levels.So feel free to test the demo, if you are not like ""I want more of this"" by the end of it, the game is not for you.Otherwise, it will occupy about 10+ hours of your time.If you are interested in some gameplay, I have a lest's play (in french) :https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqtlWN_S1WDR-GXPgZvwNlmL71H-rinkD "

								Wonderful 'tiny' train management game, which did all things the right way. Got fascinated from the very first second...and forgot time about. :-)You could play step-by-step upgrading levels or just free game. It's kind of an puzzle game to get tracks in best lines. Nevertheless you get wondering how you may send the next train while one, two or more already on the trail. Sometimes it's just a millisecond that saves you from a train-crash, while you keep an eye on your finances. Funny look in best Sid Meier's Railroads tradition, but game is more a puzzle then a railroad simulation. Very funny game for an affordable price.			"

All in all a highly recommended romp!			"

												The very first thing you should know about this game is that it is not a business simulation! This is no Railroad Tycoon or Industry Giant. It is more of a micro management focused virtual model railway. If that sounds strange and unconventional to you you might want to check out the free demo first.The gameplay consists only marginally of financial management and largely of creating track layouts and manual train guidance. The challenge comes from creating connections between set stations and handling an ever growing amount of railway traffic that will put your planning skills to the test. With the help of 3 different game speeds and a pause button at your disposal you can decide yourself how reflex heavy each level will be.This game is best played in short bursts since each level can be finished within minutes. Yet it maintains a decently high level of replayability, especially for players that like to maximize their efficiency and want to perfect track layouts for optimal capacity.The level design is appealing and varied with an almost toy-like aesthetic. And the music is appropriately soothing and up-beat. Though it might get repetetive if you decide to 'binge' the game and finish it in one sitting.Depending on your personal aim in terms of perfection and Highscores that may take you between 5 and 20 hours.Overall you can expect a very pleasent experience for a rather low price tag.

												This is a puzzle game that takes cues from strategy/management games rather than a management game in itself, and that's important to remember. Having accepted this simple and reasonable premise, you must understand how absolutely excellent and fun this game is.It tasks you to complete a seemingly simple building and scheduling puzzle, which can be, if you take your time and use everything at your disposal relatively straightforward. Then it throws in a few limitations and challenges which cause you to break into a worried sweat, madly clicking on everything in a precise order and quite forgetting to pause the game sometimes.

The first few levels were really easy, and I was worried at first that the game might not provide enough of a challenge, but the difficulty picks up pretty quickly after that.

												The perfect little time killer. You can jump on for 10/15 mins or find yourself an hour later still glued to this. To call it a spinning plates game would do it a disservice.Gameplay involves deciding where and how to lay tracks then managing the track switching to make sure the trains go to the correct destinations. It’s all about laying efficient routes (financially and practically) and juggling the train journeys between points. You're under a time limit - the longer the trains take, the less money you earn. You have a finite amount of money to lay tracks. Destroying buildings/trees to lay tracks costs more. These time and money pressures add up to make a well balanced challenging little game.A simple premise, it's addictive and moreish. This is more puzzle game than train sim..shame it's not on mobile.Kudos to the devs. Recommended			"

								I really love this game. On one side you have a pretty clear game play, on the other....On the other.. I just tell you that after playing this game for 5 minutes it gave me a real challenge. And then I just play, play and play. Restarting the same level again and again. By the way, it's really cool that in each level every new session you'll have new positions for stations. I'm a real fan of OTTD. And even Train Valley is not so complex as OTTD and gameplay is different. Somehow in my mind I compare these two games and find them quite similar in the spirit.So Train Valley is definitely worth money I've spent! Give this game a chance and you won't regret it ;)			"

												Not sure if you've ever played ""Sid Meier's Railroads"" but it's a much more simplified version of that (and that game was fairly simple to begin with!). Someone also compared it to ""Lionel's(?) Train Town"" which is also a fair comparison to make!To start with, it's not a tycoon game so don't be fooled by the images if they look like a Railroad Tycoon. The game is more focused on being a puzzle game based around trains. I'm sure if you've played Railroad Tycoon or the like you've had to overcome complicated junctions or network improvements the puzzles tend to focus on that skill - placing stations in awkward places. Every so often the game will general a train which will be at one of the stations (there's a gauge timer thing at the bottom right of the screen so you can see when the next train will generate) - you can also call on addional trains to create additional revenue. The train will be assigned a colour and you have to create a route via the switches/junctions you've made in your solution to get the train to it's destination. Laying track and destroying objects costs money and, along with a tax you have to pay, your balance can deplete quickly - going below 0 results in bankrupcy and you lose the game.There are four different regions progressing in difficulty. Difficulty in this game is present through awkwardly placed stations, objects to either neogotiate around or destroy and build over at an addition cost (depends on what you destroy for cost) and the challenges present in each level (spend x money, don't let trains go to the wrong stations, etc) create some replayability.This is a fun puzzler and the trains were just a bonus (well, at least for me anyway).

												Going into it, having only looked at the title and a few screenshots I expected a watered-down version of Railroad Tycoon, but still an economic strategy. Instead I got an arcade game where the core of the gameplay is laying tracks and operating junctions so that nothing crashes. But I'm far from disappointed. There is something incredibly satisfying about playing with trains and operating the switches, listening to all the choo-choos and occasional explosion. It seems the game successfully evoked subconscious, positive feelings of playing with model trains when I was younger. Which almost guaranteed that I love it, unless there would've been some hiccup with the technical particulars (ex. graphics, sound). Luckily those are also spot on and while not very impressive or flashy, they keep in theme with the playful atmosphere. The only issue is a nasty crash when closing the game, but there are workarounds (alt-f4 followed by ctrl-alt-del). Highly addictive and recommended.			"

You would think it would be super easy building a train track and getting the trains to the correct stations by switching the direction of the junctions, but it's more complicated then it seems.  I have been replaying all of the levels trying to get perfect scores on each so the game has tons of replayablity and I have no intention of putting the game away for a long time to come.   Buy this game as quickly as possible.			"

												English than PortugueseFrom someone if 27.6 hours played and who finished the game with all the "" Stamps"" and completed as All the Achievements (with exception of those in dlc )English:I believe it is important to tell those interested in buying this game that, although it is a very good game, is not exactly a train simulator.If you exchange the stations for water records, the tracks for pipes and the trains for water, the game operation would remain exactly the same (!), so, it´s a puzzle that uses the ""skin"" of trains . In the end, you don´t do nothing but have to come up with a way to take the trains (replaceable by any other object) from point ""A"" to ""B"" point.The criticism is because I bought the game having in mind something like the old Railroad Tycoon II, and there is absolutely nothing of his features here.There is no management of the trains. You indicates your ways and just take care of the break.The connection of the tracks is simple, limiting creativity in creating lines (intersections) more complex.There is no freedom to choose which trains to use, which loads carry loads, which station is more important to get that load, and so on .... it is a puzzle where you connect points. A very good and even challenging at times, but a puzzle. Not a simulator.Likes puzzles, go ahead.Expect something more than a puzzle ... better pass or run the risk in a very good sale.Português:Para indicar minha experiência com o jogo, tenho 27.6hr. de jogadas e terminei todas as fases, cumprindo com todos os desafios (são três por fase). Tenho todas as conquistas existentes com exceção daquelas constantes na dlcAcredito que seja importante avisar àqueles interessados na compra deste jogo que, apesar de se tratar de um game muito bom, não é exatamente um simulador de trens.Se você trocar as estações por registros de água, os trilhos por canos e e os trens por água, o funcionamento do jogo continuaria sendo exatamente o mesmo (!), ou seja, trata-se de um puzzle que utiliza a ""skin"" de trens. No final das contas, vc. não faz nada além de ter de bolar uma maneira de levar os trens (substituíveis por qualquer outro objeto) do ponto ""A"" ao ponto ""B"".A crítica fica pq. comprei o jogo tendo em mente algo como o antigo Railroad Tycoon II, e não existe absolutamente nenhuma característica deste.Não há administração dos trens. Você dita seus caminhos e no máximo os pausa. A conexão dos trilhos é bem simples o que limita a criatividade na criação de linhas mais complexas (cruzamentos mais complexos).Não há liberdade para escolher que trens usar, os evoluir/melhorar, que cargas levar, para onde levar, a importância da carga para aquele local e assim por diante.... se trata de um puzzle de conectar pontos. Um muito bom e até desafiador às vezes, porém, um puzzle. Não um simulador.Curte Puzzles, vá em frente.Espera algo mais do que um quebra-cabeça... melhor deixar passar ou correr o risco em uma sale muito boa.			"

												I have been having a blast with this puzzle game. Mostly because I found out there is a pause game button, so I can plan my moves without rushing everything.The game has been very stable, no crashes. Some people have complained about the collision not working correctly, but I suspect that is a problem with their computer, or they are not paying close attention to their trains movement, because I am on the 3rd level and have had no such problems. I have crashed trains, but that was my fault, not the games.The game is very replayable, as each level starts with different train stations at the start. And its also random which station trains will start at. Like most puzzle games, you can replay levels as much as you like, to better your score or just for the fun of it.Overall, I recommend the game to anyone who likes puzzle type games. If you like it fast paced, then don't use the pause key. ;)			"

Early Access Review
								I bought this game because I enjoy building train layouts, liked the original Railroad Tycoon way back in the early 90s, and like optimization puzzles.  That's good, because this game hits all those likes of mine to some degree, and I love it for that.What you do:  you build tracks between stations, and dispatch trains that the game randomly builds (or, you can summon your own in addition to the random ones).  Each scenario is a bit different--goals for specific scenarios don't vary within the scenario, but placement of stations and obstacles do to a degree.  In general, goals are of the variety:  don't crash trains, build X amount of track, make X amount of money, manually summon X amount of trains.  These sound simple, but the land area of each scenario is small and you need to make efficient rail networks in that small space without going bankrupt. Additional stations appear as the game progresses, so you have to modify your rail network on the fly.  This isn't a surprise after your first scenario, but they are also placed somewhat randomly in a random order, meaning you have to think on the fly.  Thankfully, the game does include a pause button and you should make use of it often.  You direct the trains as you go, throwing switches to put trains on specific paths.  Screw up switching even once, and you may be restarting the scenario if it's a bad enough miss.  :)Good:  engaging play, certainly not a piece of cake, but not impossible either.  Graphics are clean and perfect for this kind of game.  Music and sounds work well and fit the game.  Bugs are pretty much non-existent.  Meh:  keyboard shortcuts appear to be unlabeled nor identified, and not changeable.  Some of them can wreak havoc with your game.  No ability to save in mid level, and scenarios aren't super quick.Bad:  Scenarios often have razor thing win margins.  This is not unusual for optimization puzzle games, but can be frustrating if you've never played one before.  So, perhaps this isn't a ""bad"" thing, as I'd sure not want this changed.  Still, it comes as a warning--not so much to stay away from the game, but don't give up on it too quickly.Overall:  Highly recommended for those who like optimizing things for fun, designing rail networks in confined spaces, and choo choo trains.  Easily frustrated by puzzles?  Probably not for you.			"

												I got this game thinking it would be like Roller Coaster Tycoon, but found something slightly different. Yes it does require micromanagement, but did not need me to micromange a bunch of things. It need a little more thought in how and where I built tracks and use of my money. It is a nice game to just relax with and if you like to have a podcast or something else going on the side, at least for myself anyway.      The graphics, while I don't speak for everyone, are nice. They make me feel like a kid playing with a model train set. It almost makes me want to go out and buy a model train set, but this was alot cheeper and had less of the mess. The graphics are not overly intensive but then again there really is no reason they need to be, but that is just my opinion. So I would would be willing to say that a good amount of computers could run this game no problems.      While I have not completly finished this game I would still say I am willing to recommend this game to a friend.			"

												First thing I want to say - this is very good game. It is build with simple mechanics that turns into gameplay with pretty high difficulty at the last levels. Be prepared to restart a lot at the second half of the game. It's hard to compare with any game that I've played, but there is one, which is basically the same - old DOS game called Short Lines from 1992. I have spent a lot of time playing ShortLine and I really wanted something more modern - Train Valley is exactly that.Of course It has a few thing, that I'd like to be improved - bigger maps; better UX (sometimes it hard to click on train to launch it or on switch etc.); music, better turn it off once you get to the settings;  more variety. I will hope on Train Valley 2, but, unfortunatly, it looks like we will not get it soon :(Thanks guys for the grate game, I will recommended to my frieds ;) "

												This is not another Railroad Tycoon type of game.  The main aim for Train Valley is to link a bunch of stations in close proximity and get the trains to the other stations as quickly as possible without them crashing into one another or going to the wrong station (colour coded).  Some also have objectives relating to the number of trains you must run before the time runs out or how much you need to earn (get them to stations quicker and/or run more trains).This is pretty simply to play, but it requires constant attention  You are constantly fipping track switches to make the trains follow the correct route.  Highly recommended, particularly for casual gamers.			"

												A simple, relaxing, casual game. The goal is to build a train track that will transport trains to their designated station colors before you run out of money. More stations pop up over the course of a level, so you must modify your track to adjust while keeping the trains moving and making you money. Not very difficult, enough to be engaging without being frustrating. There is no plot here, just navigating waves of trains until the level is complete. Got this in a humble bundle, and I have to say, it's nice to play a carefree game like this on occasion.			"

 Notice: This game was sent to me to review by my YouTube network. However, my opinion is not biased and is honest to how I feel ab out the game. Train Valley has been sitting in my Steam Library since October, and I only downloaded it today when I was bored. To my surprise, it's a lot of fun. For the (almost) hour I've played, I have enjoyed every minute. Firstly, Train Valley has an outstanding almost cartoonish art style.Secondly, The game has a lot of content. With over 24 levels, each lasting about 15 minutes(or longer), there's a lot to get through. Not to mention the Sandbox mode, which allows you play all the aforementioned with unlimited money and other game changing bonuses. Thirdly, I enjoyed the sound track. Great ambient music.Last but not least, Train Valley is extremely well optimised. On the highest settings, I was easily generating way over 60fps. Allowing for an enjoyable, good looking experience.Overall, the game is great. But it's not very original. I've seen these game idea countless times online, usually free too. However, the quality and quantity of content in Train Valley cannot be beaten.I highly recommend this game and I would of definitely paid the £6.99/$9.99 price premium had I not been offered it for free. Correction:  I discovered this game is capped at 60fps, which I was easily maxing out.			"

												Great game and a nice 'puzzle' concept, especially for the price. You can while away many hours with this fun game. The only annoying aspect is, after a very short countdown, one or more trains may leave a station without any control by the player. This wouldn't be so bad if the train could be immediately stopped by the player but the icon does become ready often until it's too late. Of course, that could just be a limitation of my gaming skill but it appears other players have said the same thing. That aside, it's still a lot of fun for $10.00.			"

												Puzzle game on when to start/stop trains to make the most money and accomplish the goals without crashes. You get to build some tracks and destroy some scenery but it is a brain teaser puzzle game first and foremost. Design your tracks with loops to allow you to pass trains past each other and create intricate switches to complete tasks. It is a fun addictive game that doesn't always require alot of time to just relax with.Not a resource simulation but still very fun with cool environments and visuals for a puzzle game.			"

One of those.Pros-No bugs that I can see.-Very nice colourful and pleasing graphics.-Fantastic addiction level.-For the price you are ripping off the Dev.-Really nice and simple controls.Cons-You haven't bought it yet.....fool.;)			"

												6/10.fun for 6 or 7 hours, repetitive after .  Not to be compared with Train Fever or the likes, this is NOT a train simulation. It is not a deep game, you understand the rules in 30s. This game has more its place on IPAD or IPHONE even , than on a PC. this is really well done, but it misses some elements of Fun. Price for a game like this should be around 1$.			"

												That's REALLY addicting game!It seemed easy at first, but after the 3rd level (maybe even after the 2nd?) it became quite challenging! You should build the optimal track to connect stations, choose which train to dispatch earlier to earn more (each train has different length and speed), avoiding train crashes or arrival to the wrong destination and other stuff which makes this management strategy so cool! Each level is well designed. Some obstacles on the way makes building the track more challenging, but not too hardcore at the same time. Main menu is a separate cute thing. It looks like an album with different postage stamps on the wooden table, which bring warm and cozy atmosphere.Lovely game, totally recommend it.			"

												I do really like this game, I like the challenge. However, there can be times where it's very frustrating because you may need to do some levels over and over again to get past them. Train Valley is about bulding train tracks from one station to another, and getting trains into the correct station.Having a quick look in the settings, there is also a color blind mode in there, so if you need that option, they've added it for you!SIMULAR GAMES: If you like a game on Steam called Mini Metro, you'll most likely like Train Valley. And for the people that remember the 1998 Loco Lego, and you liked the trains there, you MAY also like this game.RATING: 7/10 - Good game, get it if you like puzzles, making train tracks, organisation and some added frustration.

My only complaint is that there are fewer levels then I expected, but since the game is constantly getting updated, there should be more levels soon.The game has 2 modes: Regular & Sandbox. In Regular Mode you have to watch your money and make sure to dispatch all the trains as quick as you can. In Sandbox Mode there are no limits. You can do whatever you want.My rating: 8.7/10			"

												This is a fun little train game.  It's economics are exceedingly simple as is the user interface.  The basic game play is simple.  Lay track, control swiches, send trains to the right stations, don't run trains into each other or off the track.The challenges, however, can be very difficult.  You may be required to earn a specific minimum amount of money while getting all your dispatches perfect, and doing so will require you to schedule extra trains that you can only just barely get enough routed, while trying to make sure you're switches are all lined up so the trains don't run into each other and end up on the right track.Some reviewers have said the game is short.  This is true- there are only 24 scenarios and no scenario takes more than an hour.  However, the harder scenarios have great replay value and frankly will take many attempts to master anyway.For enthusiasts of games like Railroad Tycoon (and I am a HUGE fan myself), this takes train management down several notches to the level of operating your own home layout - which quite frankly is something I've no doubt many people have been longing for because for all the wonderfullness of Railroad Tycoon, what it is NOT is a train dispatcher simulation.  Train Valley is.Pros:- Simple interface, simple economics- You run trains, not companies- Scenario complexity is just the right level of hard- Feels like a home train layout vs. a national railroad modelCons:- UI needs refinement- A little cutesy looking- Feels like a home train layout vs. a national railroad model (yes this could be a pro OR con)Overall?  4 stars with potential.

												Train Valley is a casual real-time puzzle game, with trains as theme.It's casual as it's 24 levels only takes 10 minutes each to finish, excluding pausing and retries on the harder levels :).It's a micromanagement game, with your objective to route trains to the correct destination without making them crash or end up at the wrong station.The puzzle element comes from the challenge of building an optimum track layout that allows many trains to run at the same time.

												I've been enjoying this puzzle/strategy/simulation game even though it's become taxing as I've got later into the game.Don't expect A-Train, Transport Tycoon, Railroad tycoon etc as it's not a business simulator in that sense.The concept is simple, match the trains to their destinations and try to use the shortest routes possible to make sure you get the most money when they arrive, you have to do all this while not bankrupting yourself from building track.It can get extremely fast paced and you have to keep an eye on how your track switches are orientated as when a train passes it switches them to align with it's path, so it can mess up other trains paths.  Switches can also sometimes be obscured by buildings, so they require careful placement.Is it worth the price I paid for it? Well If you rent a dvd for £3.50 it can enterain you for approximately 2 hours, this games priced currently at £6.99 and you might notice I've spent a few more hours than that playing, so I've got my moneys worth out of it.  If I could go back in time and advise myself as to whether I should buy it, I would recommend it to myself. "

												Need a little game to calm your nerves? That's not Train Valley. It may look like casual fun, but it gets pretty hectic, pretty soon. Don't get me wrong, i really like it.  It's enjoyable logic/micro-management game. Building tracks, sending trains to right stations, trying not to crush them to each other, trying not to bankrupt... Sounds easy, but when the level becomes filled with trains and you must constantly juggle them ... It can ruin your nerves :) Active pause function helps a bit, but very often one mistake, one delay and you're royally **cked.   Overall, very cool game, but remember - it's not a cakewalk.  Far from it.			"

												Like others have said it isn't a train management game, it's a puzzle game, but it's a really good one. The graphics are great and not too taxing on a system, which means I can start it up and have a quick play in seconds. Dipping in and out is no problem and replaying some of the easier levels takes on a zen-like quality. The game is charming, with good music and sound effects and a really great design, essentially like looking at a really good train set!I was playing on level 9 or so and made a really elegant rail system, so when I didn't notice I had two trains on the same path until too late I literally cried out! All I'm saying is that any game that can get that sort of reaction is a good game. My one critisism is that the first time I played my progress was lost because I wasn't syncing to the cloud. But thats a small complaint because it was easy t o fix.			"

												Placing a piece of track is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ thus making the higher speeds near impossible to play on. However, if you can get past the finicky track placement then you're in for something real, darn good.Train Valley is essentially a management simulator. You're placing tracks, trying to get ""blue train"" from point ""A"" to point ""B""; all while trying to complete other, level specific objectives (which are OPTIONAL). If you do manage to complete the level specific objectives, then you'll gain 3 stars. Yes, it's one of those games... This is actually one of the games' biggest advantages though, at least it is for me. I like trying to get all the OPTIONAL stars. I like trying to perfect each level to the best of my ability. So all in all, I think this is a great management sim. It's also very accesible/casual, so that's nice to people who are new to this type of game (like me).So yeah, if any of that sounds interesting to you then you'll most likely enjoy this game. Just be warned that the track placement is not good, but it's not enough to break the game.			"

												This is a really fun micro-managing game. You build tracks and guide trains to their respective stations, tryingto hurry them as fast as you can while also avoiding mistakes such as crashing trains together or delivering them to the wrong station. The goals are fun, and the later levels are actually a lot more challenging than I expected. I think it will still take me a few hours to beat all the levels and collect all of the task badges. However, I expected a lot more worldbuilding to be involved. When choosing ""Sandbox"" mode, you get to chose out of all the levels to center your trains, but you have unlimited money, no tasks, and a very tiny, prebuilt playing field. I honestly bought this game looknig for the worldbuidling aspect, but was pleasently surprised with a different kind of experience. Still, I -really- wish I could build cities, make my own stations, and actually run a rail in a huge environment. Maybe the later levels will resolve this. Still having a lot of fun with it though!!!			"

The premise is simple, guide trains to the station of the same color by switching track junctions to the direction they want to travel. But it quickly becomes more hectic as you have mulitple trains to the same station, new stations opening up that need you to lay new track to and if that wasnt enough there are three optional objectrives for each level.

												I like it. It's simple, but gets surprisingly tricky later on without giving the impression it deliberately tries to [EXPLETIVE DELETED] the player over. Ninety-nine times out of a hundred the failure will be entirely on the player - bad rail placement, bad timing, inefficient routes or forgetting to set a turnout or simply running out of money for being too slow - giving the player incentive to do better, where a game that has the Random Number Generator From Hell would merely incur a rage quit.

												Not a building strategy as it might seem on a first glance, but logic puzzle directing trains to right stations, switching track, building them so more trains can pass without coliding... it is a simple concept but very catchy, I am surprised noone thought of this before. For a few bucks, it is a great game to play for a few minutes every day.			"

												This is a great little game that's easy to pick up and tricky to get right. While the early levels are extremely simple, the difficulty ramps up quickly and you'll soon find yourself struggling to complete all the objectives.There's some great polish here, everything fits together very well, and the sound adds a certain ambiance that really makes it shine.While some more DLC and larger, more complicated levels for those that want to really test themselves would be great it's already a fun experience and totally worth the price.

								I started playing Train Valley and I could not stop! Once you get up to eight plus stations its a real challenge to anyone, if you turn up the time to X2 your a genius, if your turn the time to x4 your on some kind of stimulants , playing at that speed will fry your brain. This sim is simple but elegent . It will take you from simple to strategic and on to madness.

								A fun, challenging game in an attractive package. Two questions: Why do you manually start some trains and at other times they release on their own? Why do some switches only change manually and other switches automatically flip? There is no tutorial as yet and everything is guesswork. But it is simple enough that the lack of a tutorial is not an obstacle. I'd recommend this game and I've only played it for 90 minutes. I hope they finish it off. It's a great start.			"

												Keep in mind that this is a game about micromanaging trains, not a strategy/""tycoon"" game. This game is quite fun, but quite short of you don't like completing all the challenges in the game.I picked this game up during a Steam sale for €7.00 including DLC. I would say that it was worth that money, but I am not sure if I would recommend it at full price (€12.50).Pros:- The core mechanics, laying rails and directing trains, are easy to understand and work reasonably well- The theming is great- The levels are designed well, making it a challenge to find the optimal layout of tracks to complete all challenges- The game is not incredibly difficult. The 6 levels added by the DLC are somewhat harder than the 24 in the base game. The ability to pause the game makes it a lot less stressful too.Cons:- The music is repetitive, and while soothing it just annoyed me after a while.- Rail junctions work... weird. Rail junctions are blocked when a train is on top of them. However, the game also blocks rail junctions on adjecent rails, or even crossing rails.- The challenges get stale after a bit. The challenges for Germany have some more fun ones in them, such as blowing up 5 trains.- The sandbox mode is completely broken, with train stations not showing up at all. Besides that, it's not all that fun without a clear goal or even money to worry about.- Even after completing every challenge, and completing every other achievement, I only built about 9000 train tracks towards the ""build 10.000 train tracks"" achievement. Luckily the game counts train tracks built just before restarting a level, so building a lot of useless tracks on a level with high starting money solves that problem, but ""grinding building train tracks"" is not fun nor won't it give me a sense of achieving something on reaching it.

												A simple but surprisingly addictive little game about model trains and railways.There are two main components to this game: Setting up an efficient railway between given stations on the map, and directing as many trains to their destinations as possible. Each train is worth a set amount of money that decreases with time, so the quicker you get it to its destination, the more money you get. As the game goes on, you'll have to juggle more and more trains with different lengths and speeds.Beyond earning money, each level has specific objectives which will require different approaches to beat. (like don't stop any trains, don't destroy tracks or buildings, launch a number of extra trains and so on)The demo version covers most of what the game has to offer, so I recommend you start with that.

												Train Valley is a very good puzzle game about optimizing train routes, finding a balance in shared resources, and nail-biting micromanagement.The levels play quickly, and the art (but not the gameplay) is a pleasant throwback to Railroad Tycoon 2. There is a whiff of ""sameness"" to the gameplay on each level, despite some randomization of station locations. This makes me think that Train Valley might do better in the mobile market. Regardless, it's inexpensive, and has a Demo available on Steam. If you enjoy puzzle games, give this one a shot. "

												Excellent game. It's very much about paying attention to details and good timing. I found that most of the levels were quite doable, but if you try to complete all three bonus objectives in a level some of them are quite challenging and took me more than a few attempts to win.I would recommend that you watch Total Biscuit's WTF is video to get an idea of what the game is like.The two things that would make this game better would be if there were even more of it, and if there was a level that had a crazy number of stations, say 12, on a fairly large map, with a really long time limit, so that you could get a more extreme experience of frenzied train management.The German DLC is worthwhile I think, but it did not present as much of an increased challenge as I was hoping for, and there is a frustrating level where planes bomb your trains which feels more like luck than skill (but that's only one level in the DLC).I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone that loved building a road and rail system in Sim City 2000, and who also likes time management games.

Once I've built the system I hope will work for the scenario I enjoy pushing out twice the amount of trains the rails can handle and franticly direct them to their destinations. After a while I notice my stiff back, check the clock, and panic after 3 hours have flown by. Great puzzle game with all the excitement I could want! Or even not want; It has a sandbox mode. There also have been numerous updates and more levels added since I purchased.I highly suggest trying the demo if you aren't sure. It will hook you too!			"

												Train Valley met my expectations.  I find the videos and screenshots to be misleading, as they feature zoomed in views of the map.  I play zoomed all the way out so I can always see the entire map.  I don't see any advantage to zooming in.  Each level starts with two or three stations.  You decide where the track goes.  Trains appear at random stations, and you need guide each train to its desired destination.  As the level progresses, more stations appear.  You have much more control than in Mini Metro, and consequently you do more micromanagement - mostly toggling switches to try to route trains where you want them to go.  On the plus side, this means that when things go wrong, it is almost always your fault, whereas success in Mini Metro depends more on luck and chance.  More trains + more track + more switches = more complexity.  You can also call in extra trains for extra points.  The challenge is designing and discovering track layouts that are easy to manage.  Some of the UI elements could be improved (see my comment in the Steam discussions), but I have adapted to the unfortunate UI deficiencies.			"

You need to make friends with the 3-step speed controls and the Pause button in order to succeed. That's because although laying your track is half the battle, the funds to build and destroy it come from the deliveries you make, and crashes and wrong destinations all impact your income. In other words, the main fight here is with scheduling your trains. The game mechanics are fairly intuitive, and of course the more you play, the more you understand. In this way, Train Valley is both rewarding and frustrating, because there are still some things that require some time and attention to understand. One key concept here, which I'm still not entirely sure about really, is of your trains taking off of their own accord once the cargo value timer has dropped to a certain point. This appears as a set of tiny figures above each train, and if I have only one complaint with the game, it's that this essential bit of information is too small to see comfortably. There is a handy option to scale the UI up and down, although the figures don't scale with it.The feedback between your tack layouts and the efficiency of your scheduling is pretty tight -- get one right, and the other will work so much the better too. With successive timely deliveries made, your cash reserves will be able to cope with the odd crash or mis-direction. In the end though, it's easy to over-spend, so walking that tightrope between track design and scheduling is, again, crucial.As much as Train valley is about quickly clicking on your junctions and switches, the game definitely gives your brain a good workout, in much the same way that Bridge Constructor-type games do. I think it's well worth the 10 Euro Steam price, although I got mine for 2 Euros from Bundlestars, which is an absolute steal, frankly. Great game, and I highly recommend it.			"

												Train Valley is a Mini Metro-esque puzzle game disguised as a railroad management game. You have to manage money and all that, but it's really about plotting out your railroads, switching the junctions, and managing the trains all moving at once. It makes for some really challenging puzzles, and the cute aesthetic brings it together nicely. It does take a while to figure out that streets have no real impact on gameplay, however.			"

												I was on the fence when i was thinking about purchasing this game as it doesn't seem like the typical game i would buy. However after reading the reviews on this game , i decided to purchase it..... Well , all i can say is what a game :). I absolutely love it..... it is exactly like building a train set only with challenges along the way... if you like a fun but challenging game whilst relaxing at the same time and you like trains then this is the game for you. Also the soudtrack reminds me of a classic game of 'Lemmings' :D..... I will also be purchasing 'Train Valley 2' when it gets released.... Well done Devs on a game well made.			"

												The demo managed to hold my attention for more than 30 minutes which was enough to convince me to plonk down some dosh to get the full game. Great little puzzler and like others have mentioned, it did remind me of Flight Control but with trains. Well worth considering, especially when on sale.Note: I did originally plan on playing this on a touch screen enabled device, and while it did work mostly, I found that having a nice gaming mouse enhanced the experience that much more.

												A great time killer and quite addictive. Train Valley will keep you entertained and frustrate you at the same time then keep you coming back for a little bit more.You start out with a couple of train stations popping up with a train or two, they're waiting for you to lay down some tracks so they can be on their way, safe and sound, for now, to their final destination.As you progress more train stations will pop up here or there and that's when it starts to get interesting, trains are flying this way and that, tracks need to be layed then switched at the right junctions so you're heading to the correct station, meanwhile another train is coming at it head on. soon you'll have up to 10 trains running at the same time and you'll be looking at your elegant and efficient track layout with a smile just as a train you forgot about explodes after another head on.With a spare half hr or so to kill i'll happily have a go of each level again, it can also be hard to drag yourself away once started.10/10			"

								A great choice for railfans and strategy gamers alike. The gameplay is pretty fun and addictive; although it might be easy enough at times, at other times it can actually be pleasantly challenging. When you fail a task, you may feel more persistence and resilience than frustration.The music is rather good; quite soothing, making for a relaxing atmosphere. The graphics are okay, and present no performance issues when at the highest possible settings.Run a railway of really useful engines, or cause confusion and delay.			"

								Here is my 'First Day on Launch Day!"" Early Access Review Video:{There is currently some issue with Steam YouTube links, as every link I post links to some ""product support"" video that isn't even close to the link I paste.  To watch my early access review, please simply search ""Zaxtor99 Train Valley"" on Youtube.  Once Steam YouTube links are correctly working again, I will post the actual link here}Pretty fun and challenging little train game, works very well for an early access game and I can't wait to watch this game progress towards completion.  Don't confuse this game with much more sandbox train simulation games like Sid Meier's Railroad, or it will likely leave you disappointed.  But for a simple little puzzle and management type of game, this game succeeds very well, especially for such an early access state.  I like it so far, and here are my early access launch day scores:- VALUE (worth 40 points):  At $9.99, this game offers a pretty good value for the money with plenty of challenge.  30/40- FUN (worth 30 points): The Fun factor is definitely here, and where this game shines.  Trying to manage the trains, the   tracks and your money and income on each progressively more difficult level is loads of fun.  25/30.- CONTROLS & BUGS (worth 20 points):  The controls are simple and easy to figure out, and this is nice allowing you to focus on the mission objectives, track switches, and everything else that is part of this game.  No bugs I've seen.  20/20.- GRAPHICS & SOUND (worth 10 points):  The graphics and sound are plenty nice for this kind of game.  8/10.TOTAL SCORE: 30 + 25 + 20 + 8 = 83%.  My early access review for this game is an 83%.  Like I said above, I like this game and this pretty high score comes from the game offering a lot of value and fun and solid controls with no bugs found in me first day in early access experience to this point.  Not a bad score for an early access game!  :-)			"

												Before I get into the review here's the basics of how the review will work. There are normally 10 categoriesthat I use when reviewing a game. Those ten categories are Fun, Creativity, Challenge, Graphics, Music, Cinematics, Story, Content, Controls, Gameplay. Each Category will be rated 1 through 10 with a maximum score out of 100.So let's get started on the review.Train Valley is an Indie, Simulation, Strategy game published by Flazm and developed by  Alexey Davydov, Sergey Dvoynikov, and Timofey Shargorodskiy, and was released on September 16th of 2015. Category 1: FUN (10 out of 10).After playing about 40 minutes of the game I have found that the game is actually quite entertaining to me. While I'm not normally a puzzle gamer this game did catch my eye as I do have quite an interest in trains in general.Category 2: Creativity (10 out of 10).In this Category my perspective is that mostly for train based games, I've normally found simulation or strategy types without a puzzle element. Now while I'm sure that there are other puzzle genre train games out there, this is the only one that I have come across in these early days of my gaming channel. I'm sure that I'll be finding more out there.Category 3: Challenge (10 out of 10).In the beginning of the game, as to be expected, there was no challenge at all. At first I thought the challenge aspect wasn't going to really build up but by the fourth level, I found that I was just lying to myself. Things got quite interesting in fact. Now, I only made it the first 5 levels before I started becoming flustered and gave up.Category 4: Graphics (10 out of 10).The Graphics in this game seem to me to be a bit child-like cartoonish, but in all honesty I also feel that being a family friendly game, it was meant to be done in this fashion. My framerates while both generally playing and recording this video stayed steady between 29 and 30 frames per second for me while utilizing an MSI R7 250 2gb pci-e video card with the resolution set at 1920 by 1080, with the fullscreen option ticked and quality settings put at recommended (which I believe were at the highest quality settings.) It was easy enough to see everything with my vision problems and the textures were quite decent for the style given.Category 5: Audio (06 out of 10).There's really not much to be said about the music in the game other than it seems to be one looped track throughout what I've played. If the music changes in the game, I've not been made aware of it as of yet. That being said, the music seems to be slightly upbeat and wasn't overtaxing on my ears; however, I do tire of the same thing on a constant basis when it comes to instrumental music. I'd prefer variety and would have liked to seen more tracks during my gameplay. The sounds effects however were lovely and I was able to distinguish what I was listening to based on the effects of the actions taken. The sound effects is basically what is saved this category.Category 6: Cinematics (05 out of 10).The only cinematics that I've experienced is at the beginning of the game and between the levels where the portfolio book opens and the levels get stamped. Now, while a lot of others would not call it cinematics but more along the lines of animations which would end up in graphics, I felt as if putting it here would be the best choice. That being said, I felt as if they could've used a bit of work by actually making the animations into a more lively cinematic by adding an arm coming from the screen and a hand actually opening the portfolio. I would have also like to have seen some sort of cutscenes either animted or filmed to help fit the story line. Category 7: Story (08 out of 10).While there is a Story Mode to the game I've not really witnessed the story, but based on several reviews I've read including those from Steam Users and well known reviewers the Story is pretty good. I didn't have the time to fully delve into the Story itself, I've rated this Category based on many many reviews both positve and negative. Category 8: Content (08 out of 10).With 15 different trains and 18 different cars I was quite happy in the beginning with what was available. While I didn't get to witness all of the trains or cars personally during my short playtime, I was quite happy with the levels 'release' of train types based on level and time and am quite positive that as the Story unfolds any player will love experiencing each type. I would also love to see future releases of content with more cars and engines and maybe even some sort of expansion pack or update that allows more freedom. I would even like to see turntables and signals added into the game to give a bit more realism in stopping or turning the train around. Maybe even an option to also choose an engine type when selecting an early train. But all in all, I'm satisfied with what is available now. Category 9: Controls (10 out of 10).First let me just say that I love the controls in this game; and one of the things I like most is that you can map the controls to your liking. Control mappings are Switch mode, Build mode, Demolish mode, Scheduling additional trains, Pausing, Speed settings and even the Menu. You also have the capability of inverting the zoom functionality as well as adjusting the scroll speeds to your liking. The mouse movements were very fluid and I was able to hit switches with ease as well as getting the trains to stop and reverse with great ease. With all the games I've played, I never could stand having to put the mouse in a very small precise locations in order to toggle something and that includes train as well as aviation simulators. I was quite pleased with how well the controls were made. Category 10: Gameplay (10 out of 10).The gameplay itself was quite easy to understand from the beginning and the small video tutorials that popped up were a huge help. For being some one who's easily distracted, I was able to keep focues while playing lest I wreck everything and destroy the world. I also loved the fact that if you didn't acknowledge a train within a certain timeframe that they would depart anyhow, and if you aren't paying a lick of attention, there's no telling where that train could end up. As the cities grew I was fascinated by each building popping up as trains arrived, as if the city was growing. As the game continues and I progressed the levels I became more and more interested in the game.Overall Rating: So when all is said and done, I'm giving Train Valley an overall rating of 87 out of 100. I was quite pleased with everything and looking forward to playing this game a lot in the future as a wonderful way to either pass time or test my logic when I'm feeling quite... illogical. Thanks for reading my review and I hope it helped in your decision regarding the purchase of this game. Remember, there is a Demo if you'd like to try before you buy and experience it for yourself.For the review video I've done, see

												Micromanage Valley is a game from Oroboro. Set in the world of Facebook, you will find yourself constantly frustrated at what you thought would be a fun tycoon/stategy-like game with an inoffensive art style where you can build up your rail network and marvel at your intricate layouts.You will be constantly forced to micromanage an infinite stream of trains that have a habit of spawning at the worst possible times, usually resulting in a crash. There will be ridiculous challenges that you must complete such as not being allowed to edit your railway lines.After an hour of playing this game I was halfway through so I decided to turn to the sandbox mode just to see if it would offer a more relaxed approach and allow me to send out trains when I wanted and build my network, nope there was no money to save up, no trains to buy or upgrade, just boring micromanaging.There is absolutely no sense of achievement with this game which is dissapointing. To call it a simulator is a massive stretch of the imagination as 90% of the game is simply clicking arrows to change the direction of the trains.Definately not recommended - Play the free demo first.

												While it might not look like it but Train Valley is one of the best puzzle games that I have played in quite a while.What makes Train Valley stand out is that while it is pretty simplistic it is still challenging. All you do in the game is build tracks and guide the trains towards their destination. The fun comes from creating the routes and juggling multiple trains at the same time while trying to keep them from crashing into one another and running out of money. Train Valley does a great job of being a relaxing game that still challenges you.I would classify Train Valley as an easy to play but hard to master game. It is not that hard to beat the levels in Train Valley but it becomes quite hard to 100% some of the later levels so there is quite a bit of challenge if you want it. Length wise the game includes 24 levels and should take at least six to eight hours to complete. I found Train Valley enjoyable enought though that I actually wanted to try and complete as many of the additional objectives as I could which can add quite a bit of time to the game. If you are looking for a train simulation game or don't really like puzzle games, Train Valley is not going to be for you. If the game's premise sounds interesting though I think you will really enjoy Train Valley. If you would like to read my full review check out  Geeky Hobbies [www.geekyhobbies.com] .			"

												This game is like Trainyard on Apple's Appstore.  Cool to play, good user interface.  Nice graphics.  You can easily enjoy 20 hours and more of gameplay with this game.  Would be good to be able to upgrade track points to automatic in a sandbox mode.			"

								Excellent addictive game that I cannot wait to see where the development takes it. Much better than other games with predesigned tracks and having to lead the correct colour train to the correct station. The fact you need to build the track is highly satisfying and very challenging. Buy it now :)			"

								It might start off easy, but it's a hard game to master. To begin with, it's drag-able track, that automatically links up or creates crossings by itself. Then you run trains, and where you can afford or have space to, extra trains. However, TV is not without issues. 1. bankruptcy is common. 3K of tax annually cripples you if you've been building a lot or had a bad year for revenue.2. Beware the optionals - achieving them is harder than it looks. 3. Russia is incredibly hard to conquer. Get some practice in. Overall, I'd rate the game at the moment a 8/10. It's good now, but a couple of nights play will get you through most of the levels, but not necessarily with the optionals. Japan is the next area; I hope they do it justice.			"

								Very enjoyable railroad building game, with attentive developers willing to listen to the players on possible improvements.The latest update helped to alleviate the bankruptcy issue, leaving the challenges of actually running the trains and building the tracks the focal point.  Beware! Some trains schedule themselves for departure, and you have to be ready to  handle them, or suffer the consequences.The overarching victory condition on all levels is to survive. The bullets shown on the right of the screen are optional, and none of them need to be achieved in order to advance to the next level. Those optional bullets are very challenging, and add replayability to the game.The actual laying of the tracks and placing of the switches is very easy. Faster trains become available as you progress through the level you are playing, but watch out for older, slower trains as they are NOT retired, but continue to function, adding additional challenge to the level.The graphics are nice and functional. Same for the trains.This is one of those games where you'll want to play until you beat the current level, and can't wait to conquer the next.Definitely worth the price of admission.			"

												Train Valley is a puzzle/logic game with trains as its main theme. The goal of the game is to manage trains and build tracks without running out of funds by the end of the level. There are additional objectives you can try and achieve, and each map has a different layout and enough randomness to keep things freesh.This is NOT a simulation, tycoon or similar type of ""management"" game. It's a puzzle game with a charming theme and presentation. If that sounds up your alley, I definitely recommend it.			"

								Quite possibly the perfect distilation of the train management genre into a light modern style. Simplified but complex enough to be very challenging, all while still giving the player a lot of freedom. That's a hard balance to get right, but these guys have done it. There are still a few minor bugs, but it's surprisingly polished for an Early Access game, and already an absolute joy to play.			"

								Okay, so this concept might have been done on the iPhone with Trainyard, but this is a huge step up. Less about the puzzle and more about the careful placement of track and when to actually start that train...The style is great, animations simple and not distracting.Not having to scroll the screen like some PC games keeps your attention. And.. this is hard. Not too hard you want to quit, but hard enough that if you want to complete with all achieves its going to take some time...and more time.Only at level five and just burnt through a few hours without knowing about it.Going to keep me going for a while yet.

Still in the early stages yet. Graphics are nice.But all in all 7/10 for this!One of the big drawbacks is that you cannot draw a full endto end road as it cancels itself out and you have to start over!It goes too quickly through the months!The other STUPID thing about this game is when your balance goes down to 0IT DOES NOT MEAN YOU ARE BANKRUPT but the game thinks so!

A Great Train Game!This game is actually REALLY Good! I was amazed at how well it's easy to pick up and just enjoy the mechanics of it. 40 minutes in and I was hooked. If you like trains, this game with have you aboard!Basically the game is time managing with trains, the trains can and will collide of you don't offer another line for another train or provide the time it takes to clear the line you use before its too late. Lay track strategically saving time and money or would you rather cut down trees to make it a strait shot for trains? or save money to work around them objects in your way?The game is really well made even in the beta I haven't had any problems yet. But the devs are sure doing a good job so far. Train Valley is my kind if game, it's addicting.Weegee APROOVED "

												I really tried hard to like this game. I played the game once and didn't like it. A few months later I decided to give it another try because I really like train games. I've put hundreds of hours into Railroad Tycoon, Avalon Hills 1830 and many other train games.Unfortunately Train Valley is one of the few train games I don't like. To be honest, it is terrible. The on screen instructions are confusing - for example the first pop up tells you to create a track by joining green tiles. What green tiles - oops, the forget to tell you to first click the tiny track construction icon.Similarly I never managed to meet some goals because I had no idea how to do what the game asked. Dispatch 3 additional trains - I assume I click on the dispatch train icon, but nothing happens. At some point I do manage to dispatch a train but I have no idea how and I can't dispatch the required 3 trains.None of this would matter much if the game were fun, but it isn't. Sending trains out of stations and switching track, how exciting. Boring and confusing sums up this game, worst train game I've played in ages, maybe ever.			"

												Love the idea, hate the execution.It has a really weird loose condition: you can't have negative balance, like in all other economy based games, resulting in regular and spontaneous ""You are bankrupt"" pop ups, while you have 4 really expensive trains on there way to the stations. Usually it happens because you had to expand new rail tracks really long to a new trains station and spend all the money. And than after a minute the tax comes and makes you a bankrupt. So you have to always keep an amount of money on your bank account to not let it happen, though the amount is always growing during the level, so you have to guess or loose.Can't imagine play testers did not mention it while on development. It also has a typical Unity bug: it works really terrible on a dual monitor PC. So you are most likely have to change windows registry to be able to play the game. Also, the devs were not of a particular help here.The UI even on a regular 1920p monitor is tiny and unintuitive. I have a 27' monitor and it's hard to spot most essential gameplay information when you need to. The tools icons are like 20 pixels at the top of the screen and the new train icon on the station (most essential gameplay ui element in the game) is like 5.Track building tools are rather unresponsive, far from polished.The lack of a proper tutorial is a pain also.It's sad, that developers didn't put enough effort here. The game plays rather nice even with all these problems.			"

												This is a great mini-game providing lots of fun for at least 20 hours. New price is €9,99 so this is great value, also. Your goal is to send all trains to their specific station. Don't make a mess crashing them or sending them to the wrong station. Different level with different tasks, so your gameplay changes every level. Not too hard to get all medals. The biggest plus for me: I didn't found a single bug, well coded piece of software (or app, as you freaky young people would call it)!Very good gameplay, neat graphics, all you need. And you don't even need to be a train maniac to love this game. Grab it!			"

I did a lot of replays of several maps because I wanted to get all the objectives in one row and except for one map I did it.But it has oldish technical parameters, like no 16:9 resolution and the UI is not great.

												This is a great mini-game providing lots of fun for at least 20 hours. New price is €9,99 so this is great value, also. Your goal is to send all trains to their specific station. Don't make a mess crashing them or sending them to the wrong station. Different level with different tasks, so your gameplay changes every level. Not too hard to get all medals. The biggest plus for me: I didn't found a single bug, well coded piece of software (or app, as you freaky young people would call it)!Very good gameplay, neat graphics, all you need. And you don't even need to be a train maniac to love this game. Grab it!			"

I am SO freaking glad I waited until this was on sale for less than $3 to buy.  Now say it with me: ""I will never write a program loop that can potentially loop infinitely without allowing indows events to process!"" Yup - thats all you have to do - in any loop which could get stuck because you assume that an exit condition Will occur, put in a call to Application.DoEvents - it doesnt have to be in Every iteration of the loop - you could always add a counter or check system time and check the milliseconds MOD some value.

It looks good enough, but the gameplay is very simple.			"

								Another little gem I picked up when browsing games on Steam.You have to build track between each station and deliver the trains to their intended destination, whilst avoiding crashes, sending to the wrong place and running out of money.  Each scenario has three different objectives.All in all, a neat and ingenious design that is a lot of fun for only £6.99.			"

I don't know if you can rotate the map as the trailer shows.You have to manage yourself the train crossing and beware of trains going out of stations on their own, or else  your tracks will explode everywhere, Michael Bay style.As other said, il you like fast speed strategy games, this one will be hard enough for you. Take a first look at some let's play before buying it...Bonus point for colorblind mode!Oh, and the tutorial is very light : you can pause the game to better think of your strategy!			"

			Views: 163		

			- Here we have an honest unbias review of the game train valley. I struggled to find the game cheaper other than the steam website itself!		

So i got this game from the the developers to test and make a review. Ill be honest its to much like a facebook game! Its too casual and i enjoy casual games. For this game it should be alot cheaper, i do think there are ways to improve the game. You can listen to my thoughts on this on the video above, but over all i beleive it is to expensive for what it is, its to casual and its not engaging, biggest improvement that could be made is making the stations to be able to be deployed where every you like instead of static locations.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me, ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it because this game gave me cancer anyway.This was a prank, but I really don't like this game.			"

												Train Valley nails the simple game mechanics + good execution = fun gameplay formula. There isn't much to Train Valley, you can build tracks, start or stop trains, and toggle switches between tracks. The real fun in the game lies in trying to reach the level goals and achievements. Complete the level without ever stopping a train or maximize your efficiency to make as much money as possible. It has a lot of parallels with tower defense games. You want to build you train tracks in an efficient layout, connecting all your stations in all directions, but using the minimum amonut of space. You only want to spend money on new track when you have to, using surplus cash to send extra trains for even more money.Overall a solid recommendation. Especially if you enjoy the mazing and profit min/maxing parts of tower defense.			"

												Price point score $2.50 Potential $60First it looks nice and the building works well.There is nothing really to this game. If you have streached it out to two hours you will see everything it has to offer. The sand box is made for the 4 yr old cousin that bugs you to play. it's so tiny so no pleasure for the building a beutiful thing crowd. the campain is throwing trains at you like there is no such thing as a shedual ever invented. The trains just apear and go after a short time. No time to organize build or repair mistakes. Just throw trains at you till you're broke or broken. This is not a building game nor a train shedual organization sim. So who is this game built for? 4yr ld is not going to like the campain but theres not enough to keep anyone older occupied for more than 20min. So who is this game built for? Why does it get so many unearned recomendations? Is it not finished? Do not try an run this on Windows 10 it is very unstable and a big fight to get it to run.the potential idea is here for a good game they just haven't put the effort in.Price point score $2.50 Potential $60I now rank my games for it's price point and potential price point. the point at which a game is worth taking the risk on, as in condition.

												A very fun game that brings back memories of laying switches and alternate tracks in Railroad Tycoon. It can be a little frustrating sometimes when destinations or alternate routes you hadn't planned for suddenly pop up--but destroying and relaying track isn't a terribly expensive option.  For fans of puzzles or train layout simulations this is the best I've played in a long time.			"

												Train Valley nails the simple game mechanics + good execution = fun gameplay formula. There isn't much to Train Valley, you can build tracks, start or stop trains, and toggle switches between tracks. The real fun in the game lies in trying to reach the level goals and achievements. Complete the level without ever stopping a train or maximize your efficiency to make as much money as possible. It has a lot of parallels with tower defense games. You want to build you train tracks in an efficient layout, connecting all your stations in all directions, but using the minimum amonut of space. You only want to spend money on new track when you have to, using surplus cash to send extra trains for even more money.Overall a solid recommendation. Especially if you enjoy the mazing and profit min/maxing parts of tower defense.			"

												Despite it's very easy and short game I can't say a bad thing about Train Valley. It's a quite addictive casual more puzzle-like than train-sim or strategy. It was fun. Just a solid game maybe too expensive for 9,99 euro but worth getting at sale.			"

												So i do not like the game, but the game itself is great, let me explainif you like Micromanaging and multitasking you might like this little puzzle game, but if you like macromanaging this game i would absolutely not recommend, the only macro aspect in this game is to be able to choose how you want to connect the different stations, that's it, after that its only micro micro and more micro, to quote Direwolf20 ""i like my games to play themselves"", so definitely good if you like this kind of stressing game with constant pressure, but if you want some train macromanagement, you should play the great OpenTTD wich is free.also the trailer does not reveal what kind of game really this is.

												After watching a YouTube review by TotalBiscuit of this game, I purchased it as he said without the expectation of the realism set down by other games such as Rail Tycoon, etc.  but rather for the ""frustrating enjoyment"" of playing this style of game.  As a model railroader, I do not hold this game on par but I have so far thoroughly enjoyed it after already putting a number of hours into play.  Parts of the interaction are predictable in many respects, such as the not-so-much random scheduling of trains, that only makes the challenge much more enjoyable to overcome.  I have already completed my levels but I find myself going back to replay in attempts to unlock additional achievements.I'm new to Steam, and a more mature person in age than probably most here so I have to struggle to keep up with the ""younger generation"" but I still recommend this game.  I need to learn how to find out about any add-ons or expansion packs for Train Valley so I can keep on playing!My many thanks and appreciation to the the developers for their hard work and for taking an active part in the player forums!!  I look forward to continuing to be a part of the Train Valley community!			"

												Train Valley is a fun casual puzzle game. The screenshots and Steam tags may give you the impression that it's a management sim/tycoon game, but this is not really the case.The core gameplay is fun enough. You build tracks to connect the various stations and then try to get each train to the right destination by manipulating the railroad switches. During each level new stations will keep popping up, forcing you to expand your rail network.Your main goal in each level is simply to avoid going bankrupt (this is pretty easy for the most part). Additionally, each level has three bonus objectives that provide extra challenges. Some levels also have special trains arriving from outside the map. All in all there's enough variety to keep things interesting for a single playthrough.My main issue with the game is the fairly high level of randomness. For the most part this is not really a problem as the game is pretty easy anyway, but in the later levels bad luck can really mess you up. This is not really something I enjoy in a puzzle game.Overall I found Train Valley a pretty enjoyable experience. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes light puzzle games.The good:- Fun puzzle gameplay- Rather relaxing experienceThe bad:- Too many random elements- Building tracks is somewhat imprecise- Some of the later levels get rather micromanagement heavy			"

												This is a fun game with a simple concept. Make sure all the trains get to the station they need too, sounds easy enough. It starts off that way, but quickly becomes much more difficult and you can lose track of trains fairly easily. It is a fun and easy game to pick up and if you don't have much time you can pick it up and attempt a level they usually are not too long, but sometimes it can be easy to fail.			"

												A Strangly Addictive GameI bought this game looking for something like the old-schoold game Atrain (DOS) and when I first launched it, I was disapointed as it wasn't like that. But that's okay as it never was promised as such and I didn't read the description before purchasing it. With the amount of positive reviews it has, it was a sure buy - and it has trains.I was instantly hooked on the game once I got the overall concept and how the game worked. It's a game like none other I have played despite having the same concepts as others. But it is unique in the method of which everything is applied.Train Valley is a simple game as-is, but that doesn't make it easy. It can be a very challenging game and you'll spend a lot of time getting those last few stamps. With a relative small map, you have to build train tracks between given stations and change the tracks to direct your trains towards the proper station. That in itself would be easy if you had unlimited money, time, and space - but you don't - and that's where the challenge lies.It would have been nice with a few more levels and maybe a few bigger ones, but for a sales price it's more than enough content and you can have hundreds of hours entertainment for very little money.

												A train management game that your job is to send trains that spawn from certain color stations to other color stations by building the track for the trains to get to the stations. Things get pretty hectic as more stations pop up while managing the other trains. From the technical side I had no issues with it and it ran fine.  Really had a good time playing it and the art and scenery I thought was nice.			"

												Game not optimized for higher resolutions, so you either have tiny little buttons, or play at a much lower resolution. Mouse controls are bit wonky, the detection of where it thinks the cursor is moving can be erratic. Track switching game mechanic isn't optimized very well. While the core of the game is a fine idea, it didn't hold my attention very long. Mini Metro is WAY more fun, more challenging, and more addicting, I recommend that instead			"

												This game is a fun, relaxing, joyful little timewaster. Building and rerouting tracks, sending trains on their way feels like a wonderfully purified of heavyweights like Railroad Tycoon. Distilled down to a simple core mechanic, that is just fun in it's own way.			"

												This is actually a surprisingly-charming little real time strategy/puzzle game.Nicely paced, you can pause and plan at any time, but you have to keep to juggle a lot of variables in your head at once. Planning out an order of operations for the trains is an evolving challenge, since you can request virtually as many trains to manage as you want -- a lovely self-balancing system.The objectives are all optional, and so the game easily scales in difficulty. Grade school children and adults alike can play the game and progress through the maps while feeling challenged.			"
