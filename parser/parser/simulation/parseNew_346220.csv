								Okay. Where to start? Imagine yourself, for a moment, as a lion. King (or queen) of the Savanna. Within a few minutes you find yourself thirsty. You go down to the wateringhole and have yourself a nice drink. Time to relax? Nope. Now you're hungry. Time to go get food. So you bring down a wildebeast by chasing it around for a few minutes and biting it whenever you can. Eat the meat and now you're full. Time to relax yet? Nope. You're thirsty again. So, to the waterhole again. By the time you find a spot where there isn't a croc eyeing you and get a drink, well how about that, you're starving! Repeat this process two or three more times. Oh, but wouldn't you know it, a meerkat has ran up to you in the tall grass and you can't fricking see it. So you, one of the most deadly predators of the biome, has just been hunted and killed by a small animal that any lion could realistically rip the throat out of with little effort.This game is horribly unbalanced. Pretty much any animal with an aggressive action can kill any other animal with little effort as long as the aggressor knows what to do. The meters for thirst and hunger run down way too quickly, so it's a constant struggle to keep from going thirsty or hungry that ends up being more frustrating than fun. As a carnivore, you don't feel the thrill of hunting, outwitting, and overpowering your prey, it's just a chore. As a herbivore, it's just a matter of running back and forth from a patch of edible plants and the river over and over again. It gets terribly repetative. The controls are awkward and the button to shift between aggressive and peaceful actions cycles way too quickly with anything more than the very slightest tap likely to land you on the same one you were already on.If this game interests you, try the free version online first. Trust me, the two aren't all that different and you'll likely understand just how irritating this game is.			"

												This game is interesting, but sadly there are many things wrong with it. First off, this game is FREE on the developers website, gamevial.com. Be aware alot of the problems mentioned below are also present in the free version. This game also lets you play a wide variety of animals, not found in any other game. Let me mention the pro's and con's of this game:PROs:`A wide selection of animals to play with, including able to play female animals and have children`Different environments`PVP. Bigger animals can fight and eat smaller animals.CONs:`Sadly, this game is abadonware on steam. The developers seemed to not care about it and just quit updating it.`There are some bugs in the game, including invisible totems in the safari map and other maps too.`The original game was free, but this game is paid. `Hackers run amuk in the game and ruined it. There is one particular hacker that i will not mention that is a griefer.`Some of the issues mentioned above is why the servers are pretty much empty.You better off playing the game ""MEADOW"" for a better experience. The developers actually listen to your suggestions and roll out many updates. Here is a link to it:Negative review sadly due to the above con's of the game. Sadly, this kinda of playing ruined the game. I also think that having PVP in the game kinda ruined it because that made people hack and cheat to be the stronger animal.			"

								It has the potential to become a very good game, but as of right now, it is practically the same as the Browser verison, although the hackers have (obviously) been eliminated, and there is a large drop in bugs versus the Steam version and Browser verison.I also noticed something while playing Singeplayer in the Savannah as a Wildebeest. Every Meerkat that saw me was instantly on attack mode and came after me. I find it a bit strange to be killed as a Wildebeest by a Meerkat, not a Lion or Crocodile, both of which never bothered me.The game needs some major changes and updates, but I believe within the next few months, this game will improve for sure.-Piff			"

												I'm not sure if I understand the point of this game... you sort of spawn into an area as an animal, and you can awkwardly move around an area. Sometimes you randomly turn into another animal. I turned into a bear, and tried to eat a player who was a rabbit. The rabbit obviously knows the game better, because he killed me somehow. Then I think he ate me or mated with me, Im not sure, there's only like 3 sound effects in this game. The animal models don't even act like the animals they're supposed to be. The deer sits like a dog. It's strange. This game feels unfinished, and it's definitely nowhere near a realistic animal sim.			"

								A Great experience.I've been playing this from the start including the online version, and there are huge leaps in quality in the last few weeks.Game play is quirky, and goals are obtuse, but I think that's intentional. Basically If you keep yourself alive you're winning, and what else you do is up to you.It looks like their answer to hacking is to disconnect the game from the web player version right now. It makes things kinda quiet right now in multiplayer but I guess we'll see how that pans out, and on the upside you can now play directly with your friends via steam, which is a bit more relaxed than the previously manic ""anything goes"" web experience.I love flying about which feels fluid in a way that many games misss somehow, and just running about as an animal is fun.The landscapes are ok, with beautiful moments mixed with not so beautiful. Generally it looks good.It's not educational, it's just mucking about.I'd say if you ever wanted to run about like an animal in it's natural environment this game is for you, but obviously if you want huge story driven game or fps action then it's not. Within it's remit I reccomends it :) "

								The game it self is great, it's an amazing idea. I have been waiting for a game like this to come out for such a long time.However if you plan on playing multiplayer, you kind of have to be okay with everyone hacking the game and making it impossible to do anything. I think the longest i've survived in game, was 10 mins. Oh, and don't think that you can go back in and kill them, because they are probably invincible. But hey, if you enjoy that kind of thing, I'd highly recomend it.Have fun in Lif, but this game is defanitly not for me :)			"

								I liked that the rabbit and the fox had burrows, but was disapointed they could not dig and make new burrows. Also, I think it would be cool if the Bears could have like caves or something and if the wolves had a den area. I also saw that you were thinking of having birds. If that happens i would add a nesting feature so the player could make individual homes for themselves. Over all a very cool game. Just needs some more interactive features and also i think a save feature would be cool!			"

												I will admit, I'm glad they finally updated it. The game actually looks a lot better and I like all the different animals. Though, there are a ton of flaws and gameplay is not very different. It is still buggy and the animals that chase you are impossible to deal with. It fustrates me that they did not change these things. Also, I looked everywhere and I can't find anything about the ""practice secrets"". They do not work at all...really all they do is place things like grass and food but they do not let you use them at all.....overall..I do love that they updated it and brought it back but...I am very disappointed that the game developers didn't really change anything but the look and the amount of animals.....everything else is pretty much the same. Still buggy, Still needs improvements. I will not recommended until this game is better improved.			"

								The idea behind Lif is a unique one. Playing as different animals in their natural habitat as you explore and stay alive can be a fun challenge. This Early Access version is (currently) pretty much the same as Gamevial's free-to-play version in the browser; by paying for the Early Access, you'll get updates that bring Lif closer to its realization as a more realistic animal simulator/survival game.Lif is open-world, similar to Gamevial's Fly Like a Bird 3, but Lif takes survival to another level. Naturally the animals chase and kill each other constantly because Lif allows you to attack or befriend as you please, but we can expect improvements in gameplay as Lif evolves. There's fun in being able to roam around doing what you want anyway, and we'll be able to do more as the game gets better. Lif has huge potential, and as with any game, the only way it will improve is by supporting its development.			"

			Views: 20,108		

			Let's game looks cute and cuddly, and even full of fun PvP action as an ""all-natural"" survival animal playing game, but is it actually any fun?		

The game is fun all for about 20 minutes.  Tops.  It's very early in access, and very rough, but the graphics look promising enough to make it a good game.  The biggest question is will they ever stick around to complete it and make it something that truly lasts and make it something that is fun to play for more then a very short period of time?  Doubtful in my eyes, but I hope they prove me wrong!Watch my video link above if you want to see why this game got a 47% early access score from me.  Thumbs down.  There's just far better ways to spend your money then this.  Toilet Paper in the real world is certainly one of them!			"

								I love the idea, however with every action being on one button, it realy takes away from the game. The chat system should be changed as well. I also feel there should be little goals to accomplish with each animal to progress to the next stage. maybe pick the animal you wanna start as or have to work through the food change. I just feel there should be more to it, but again love the idea your working with i hope to see more come soon.			"

												I love animal games and such, but this one.. I.. just coulent get into the point. It is nothing like it describes, it has no charts or lists or overlay to tell you what anything does or how to do anything. You don't get to Pick an animal to start, like it makes it sound. You will start out as a rabbit or a Meerkat depending on the biome you chose to start in. You simply run around and try not to die. There really is nothing else to it. From what I am reading totems might have something to do with picking a new animal. I opt for a refund already, There is not even anything to explore, Ive ran around but it seems like the area you start is a bit of it's own little loop and no matter how far you run, you are just going in circles. I think I jumped off the same mountain 4 times as I ran straight, just trying to die due to boredom.			"

												I bought that game long time ago - it wasn't cheap nor complete, but I thought the idea was very good and fascinating, and I wanted to help developers with this project. This is one of the games that convinced me in never buying an early access game ever again. It's totally abandoned. No graphic updates. No new content. Obviously no players, who would still playing it after all this time? Nowadays is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and buggy game, and even if I would love to say ""It'll get better, the idea is very good and it can become a great game!"" I actually know there won't be future updates and improvementes. There is no reason for which I should recommend you to buy this game. NO REASON. If you want to trash money, just put them in a WC. Don't buy that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stuff.			"

												Please, read this before you even click that ""Add to Cart "" button.Lif is currently a dead game. No one plays it, and only drama will happen 24/7. Please, if you want this game horribly baddly, I refer you to the demo. Where you can't acess only 2 maps. While there are plent other maps to play on. Do not waste your money on this: please, play the demo or don't even bother. The amount of Drama that happens on this game is extreme. There's not a lot of animals, the game is broken and glitched, and there is so much more that I can't even list.I use to be apart of what some players would call ""Broken Jaws Pack"" or aka Darkblade pack. I suggest if you encounter any of these players, just leave the game and come back later. You do not want to mess with them.-Broken Jaw (Will change names oftenly to avoid hate/worry other players, but if you see this name in general: He's probably fake. He will almost likley change his name in Lif.)-Dodorex (Not for certain if he's in the pack)-AraniaOnes you will not have to worry about is-Herobrine (Do not kill him, he gets angry easily)-JxhoadsI will keep this list updated: But untill then, please get the demo if you want this game. It's not worth your 9$.			"

												I absolutly love this game! Though there are some thing that you maybe can add into the game:Let's start with the homes: When I came across this game, I saw holes for the animals you start out as like rabbits and merekats. But I didn't see homes for anything else, what you could have is a home for every creature you can be, like nests for the birds and the lizards, dens for the predators, and so on.                                                                                                               Next is a glitch that is only in the savannah: I was looking for a lion totem, but I couldn't find one, and when I did, it was invisable. No wonder it was so hard to find. So if you can fix this glitch then I woud be glad, also I think the elephant and crocodile totems are invisable as well in the savannah. Then I would like to add is the new update with the Grizzly in the Tundra: In real life, Grizzly bears are one of the most powerful land animals so it should deal with the most damage, now it does the same damage as a rabbit? I'm sorry but that right there makes no sense. If the Grizzly did the most damage in the tundra then I would be happy. And the final thing is your death: Yes I get it that animals die, but that doesn't mean you exit the server, I mean like come on really? If there was a respawn then that would be great, but not exit the enitre server.Thank you for reading my review and I hope you keep on making this game better then before			"

												The idea for the game is great and creative and is what drew me in from the start, however I was not expecting it to be EXACTLY like the free version. The content you get with this is not really worth what you pay for it yet. If you are interested in this game, play the free version online before you buy this... There are pros and cons I have to mention.Pros:~Good game concept~Decent variety Cons:~Terrible Multiplayer ( The little of the players that play onine are terrible)~Lots of bugs~Very repetitive ~The AI are way too blood thirsty ~Little updates and few content, it's been out for a while and it still seems like it's in the very early stages ~High price for what you getOverall this game needs a lot of work, I expected a lot more than what I got, this program is way too easy for people to hack, and is only barely fun in single player, which if you don't play the top animal, you'll probably die in the first 3 minutes.

												This game is far from any kind of animal simulation. The game designers give you very little animal specific features. The AI all act the same. Meaning there is little difference between how a croc behaves and a lion.I was a deer killed by another deerI was a baboon stuck in a tree with two crocs at the bottom who were trying to get up the tree. There was no water anywhere near these crocs as they rarely leave water unless it to migrate to another water source. The crocs qwere fast all the time. Cros are fast when they strike, but cannot maintain that level of speed for long.Though I only paid $2.  My time is mopre precious. This is an example of game designers taking an awesome idea and mnaking a mess out of it. In retrospective they are selliong the game off the idea and not actually designing a simulation game.The game designers need to watch national geographic.			"

												The controls are barely explained and are very difficult to use. The bars within the game that run out after a certain amount of time aren't explained either - you have to guess what it all is. I'm guessing the first bar is overall health, the green is food, and the blue is thirst? Not sure. Not even the main menu has many words signifying what the symbols mean (like for multiplayer, single player, control help, etc). The game is very glitchy, too, and doesn't live up to all expectations. It was funny for the 1.7 hours of play time, but not something I'd consistently play over the course of months or even a year or two. Fighting is difficult, finding food is difficult if you're not a meat eater, and the designs are pretty bad in general - the animations glitch and what happens on your screen doesn't happen on the other person's.

												I purchased the game as I had casually played it for years in its web based form, a nostalgia moment, if you will. I love the idea of Lif, always have. However, I spent less than an hour playing the ""new"" version, and went through steam to get a refund. Bottom line? The game is just not enjoyable anymore. Multiplayer is an utter joke, and single player is vastly more annoying than it is fun. I would highly suggest not purchasing Lif at this time, it’s a money grab on a web game that was free-to-play for many years. Until the game gets a true update, and not just more useless content, I would advise looking into other naturalist type games.			"

I expect to be scared of attack all the time when I'm a rabbit or something small. But a large animal like a Wildebeast shouldn't have to be afraid of Meerkats. The only thing that should be aggressive to animals similar to the Wildebeast are the large predators. The Fennic Fox is a different story. Why is the horse aggressive to me? While in the game you can hunt anything, horses, I don't think would instantly go for a fox.Finally, the same gender. For males I can understand or females depending on the species. But there are too many. I don't care much for always being on constant attack by my own kind. Especially animals that live in groups.The Controls: Everything is done with 'ctrl' basically. This is a huge problem I think. Since I am always under attack when I try to fight, I end up eating (if I am prey this is usually where this becomes a problem) or drinking (if I am near water). It would be better if the attack button was a different button than the 'action' button. I am totally cool with eating/drinking/nuzzling being the same button. As those are specific and easy to go about than trying to fight while my head is down eating.The scent button would also be better off as a different button as well. Same issue as with the attacking.Animations:I loved the animation of the tundra hare, and I think it would be great to add that to the hare in the forest. The new animals have some great animations and so I feel the older original animals need an upgrade to their models.The Good Stuff:I saw a lot of improvements. I was really impressed. I think the biggest problem were the hackers on multiplayer which, thankfully, are gone with the steam version. The game has a lot of potential. The new animals and habitats are great. I look forward to seeing cool updates.For $9-10 this is an okay game and not much of waste, especially since things are being updated.Suggestions:I saw someone had suggested homes for all the animals in the area. I support that idea. A plains area would be cool. We have the Savanna, but I was thinking a North American plain with new animals like the Bison and mice. A prehistoric map. Not dinosaurs, but more the ancient mammals like the Mammoth and Smilodon.			"

												This game is so amazing! You can eat, drink, explore, reproduce, chat, and shape shift into different animals! And you can frolic as a wild animal in the forest, heath(mountains), serengeti, tundra, and the desert. So many places to explore and thrive in. I definitely recommend this game, and you should play it!			"

It is recommended if you like animal survival games that include single player and multiplayer. Single player is hard. There isn't much players in servers sometimes. I think they stopped updating Lif, sadly. And beware the Broken Crew who i do not wanna tell you what they do. Other than that itsretty fun!Glitches:-go out of a hole and go thru ground into water "

								Over all good gamebut I can see some minor problems1.Hunger and thirst gose down to fast2.some of the animals are to op3.This is the last reason and that is when ever I die, quit, or start a game it opens a tab for lif on a website (if you know how to fix this without the developers editing the game put it in the chat)I also have some notes for what to add1.I saw the meeracats and rabits had burrows but they are all the same maybe you could make more then 1 burrow2.all the totems are facing one way maybe you could randomly make them face different directions3.lastly I would like homes for more animals it seems bad to see animals like wolves loins and bears out in the open because they all have dens in real life so maybe you could add those(one more think I saw a hedghog in the pictures are they added yet and where are they?)

												When I first got the game, I was really excited for it. But the more and more I played it, I realized how horrible the game actually is. Even the players are horrible! The animation is just one cycle over and over and over. It's almost impossible to find totem poles and even make it to the next animal! I mean, the game would be a whole lot better if the players weren't such jerks! And I can't even communicate with them. I really think that this game needs ton of improvement. Like, you can host your own server and kick out players. Players who are even the same animal as you will try to kill you. Unless you like being killed constantly and never being able to get revenge, don't get this game! Please save your money.			"

												Pretty good animal survival game for the first 1-3 hours then you know exactly what everything is/does and it's basicly just sitting on your desk rolling up a paper ball for 3 hours of your life drinking from a pond. Also has a point system everytime you kill something your points go up that just makes it so un-realistic and makes me wanna slit my wrists. END RESULT: Don't buy this game for £6 go look for a different game.			"

												This game was not fun.  First off, the controls.  WASD is all you have for movement.  No looking up or down or using the mouse to quickly look behind you.  If you want to see whats behind you, you have to hold A or S until you are completly turned around.  You've just climbed to the top  of that hill and now you want to see whats below?  you gotta start walking down before the camera lets you see whats down.  Some people say its fun for 10 minutes.  There is no fun.  I really don't know how some people in here play 400 hours on this thing.   I mean, you walk around, you eat and thats it.  Need to pause the game in single player mode?  Sorry, no pause.  Hit esc and you die.			"

A very simplistic game. But sometimes thats a good thing!

												If you dont know what the health, hunger & thirst bars are you clearly havent played a survival simulator game before. A very fun game, though some things in single player need to be fixed, like the horse in the desert randomly attacking a fennec fox. But are there any bird totems in the forest? because i need to get better bearings. And i like the way the animals look ( well, on most of them anyway) but the animations need some work. And herbivores in single player shouldnt just go run up to a preadator and attack randomly ( ex. Deer attacks wolf) But a very good game and concept, just needs a bit of work.			"

												This game is... It. People complain about not getting to pick an animal, clearly they know little about the game before playing.The idea of using a totem to pick a new animal is interesting to me. You need to work to get the better creatures.Pros:-Interesting concept-The more recent animals have nice models-Unlike many other games, you gan eat grass-You can breed-When on an empty server or single player, there are active npcs-New and interesting ways to choose a new character-The animals suit their environmentsCons:-The older animals have poor animations and models-It can be difficult to learn the game's mechanics-Slightly odd controls-Small array of animals to choose from-Peculiar mechanicsOverall, more pros than cons, I had fun playing this game!

												Okay listen up :) Honestly, I've known the other 2 versions that aren't on Steam. I have played them for over 2 years, and I loved them. Minus the hackers. But now that it is on Steam, it's super frustrating. People can always know you're playin it, no matter your name is changed in the game or not. Not even your Steam name. Want to know why I'm writing a BAD review? It's because I've had ENOUGH of these childish players that won't let any others have fun. They kill you and insult you as soon as you enter the same server as them. It's cyber-bullying. People can actually get hurt over these things. Don't say ""Just stop playing the game"" because it's not fair. People are supposed to respect each other whether they like each other or NOT. The people I've had enough of would be Ariana, jxrhoads, Shinusaur, and spirit. That's all I can think of for now. So you have been warned, play the game if you wish :) watch out for those people. And if you don't, do not try to come to me for it.			"

								What I like< This particular version >:- A lot better graphics than any previous version on Gamevial.com- More stable framerate all a better performance altogether- Good pricing- Stand-alone game; no more webplayer! <Take that, Chrome>< In General >:- Unique, simple gameplay- Interesting community- Weirdness; sometimes strange stuff will happen ingame- Balanced playable characters; Wolf, Rabbit, Deer, Bear, Fox and more!What I don't like:- No complaints.Altogether I'd like to say; Well done, Gamevial. You've created one of the most addicting games ever.It may have some quirks, but nothing that couldn't be fixed. And now that the game is on steam, it'llbecome the game it always wanted to be.			"

												Overall, its OK. Play multiplayer, the NPC in singleplayer are out for blood, so unless you're looking for a fight, try to hang out on a server and chat with anyone online. The graphics are ok and you can learn as you go, but it's a fairly simple game.I'd say if you're bored and got the extra nine bucks, and like random eat/hangout/fight/wander listlessly games, you'll be ok.If you want direction, story, or depth, maybe give it a pass. It's pretty much a sandbox.			"

												There are only a few good animals in this game. Starting as a rabbit, you just eat grass all day. If you attack an animal, it follows you until it dies (singleplayer). Nobody told me you could die of thirst. This is clearly a remake of fly like a bird, but not everybody remembers how to play that game. A little bit of a tutorial or more elaborate control bindings would be nice. Runes on the UI page are cute but unhelpful. Seriously, paws and flowers? Sometimes you just have to get the text out (remember your end users are humans and not dingos). Worth a play though, you might like the game if you can figure it out.			"

												It has issues that needs fixed but it's an all around fun game with multiplayer and single player modes. Single player needs rebalanced because I die almost as soon as I go in. And Multiplayer is almost dead. C'mon, we need more members :)			"

												I enjoy the game but it's always a terribly long wait for new updates! (Of course I can't judge to much as I don't know how difficult these things can be) And for a long time now I go to play multiplayer and nobody else is online? I don't know if this is the server thing but I would of expected it to be fixed or what ever by now :\ I don't really recommend it tbh unless you like being killed constantly by other (Computer) Animals on single player mode			"

												I like the concept of being able to play as an animal with friends, but i do think some major changes need to be made. I mostly play single player because nobody is ever online. The npc's are either always running away from you, don't mind you or mercilessly chasing you until you kill them off, only for them to start chasing you again. When I play as the lion, the 'king of the jungle' im always being chased by something that wants to kill me that would ignore me in real life. The lion is so weak aswell, like one lion would at least be stronger than a wolf. The baby animals are just small adults and it just looks strange and there are very few sound effects in this game. When there are people online, someone on the server just will not stop killing people and nobody can do anything about it and its very annoying. A small update that just adds a few features like a ban vote in online games and making single player easier for when nobody is online would make the game more enjoyable. I would however recommend this game as it is very fun, but only buy it if you like the demo version.			"

												It's sad to see this game go i really did love it it's just hackers and the free demo just killed ""the spark"" for anybody that was new. from what i know is Singleplayer is open but Multiplayer will shut down with nobody running them anymore and no updates. everynightRIOT did play this game (made it alive for a month) and maybe getting this game for the big youtubers (mark, jack, ect.) will get this game going again? but if it doesnt then im glad it had a good run. If you got this game JUST as it's closing then right Ctrl is eat/fight/nuzzle. Devs if your reading this then i hope that this game lives on and hopefully it kickstarts again because i really dont want to see this game die on me. Well that's it and i hope that you have a nice day and Lif lives on in your memorys and in our wild hearts.			"
