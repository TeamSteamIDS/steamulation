												Hurray I thought, finally what could be an okay police simulator.Sadly, it is just barely okay.The driving is sluggish and unnecessary hard, and you are driving 97% of the time. So it doesn't take long before it annoys you. The controls for pulling a car over is also quite hard and the combination driving and operating the functions to check and pull over a car is just annoyingly hard.The traffic stops and accidents are a little bit to repetitive, but I really like the procedural part of it.The English dialogue is just weird and doesn’t always feel natural.The radio traffic is just distracting and never actually says anything.You have a partner, which rides with you in the car, but he or she just sits there and never does anything to help or says anything, why even bother, when you aren’t going to do anything with it?Come on, you got a lot of potential here to make a great game, but it falls short by quite a margin. Please patch and update.Would I buy it again? A big maybe, it is fun for a while, but it probably will grow old quit fast if it doesn’t get any kind of updates/upgrades.			"

												The game idea is great, but I doubt the execution is worth 15 bucks.Technical things to fix for the devs (afterwards I would totally buy it again): - super shi**y framerate and drops (SLI support hello?) - the car control is simply WTF, you can't drive a car like this! - xbox controller supportSome content issues I found while I was playing (2h before I got the refund): - some accidents are completely bogus, someone lost his front right door? And there is a bumper on the street! Also instead of chasing the other guy who caused it, you just put the bumper on the side (so that is still is half on the autobahn lol). This accident is also mega repetetive - WHY IS THERE A SECOND POLICE GIRL IN THE CAR?			"

												Well i spent over a week deliberating this one, in light of the mixed reviews. I ended up watching video reviews online to help me make up my mind.I'm glad I bought this game. I prefer sims over any other genre, and I always thought a highway police sim would be cool.Personally, I really can't understand why there's so many negative reviews. I guess a lot of them were written prior to the updates/patches, which appear to have corrected most of the bugs and glitches. It's really not a bad game at all if you're into simulators. And i think this is where most people make the mistake of reviewing it like a regular game instead of a sim.It can become very tedious and involved, and you can easily lose track of time and your surroundings while playing it. But for me, that is essentially what simulators are all about. They do, after all, have to replicate their real life counterparts. So be prepared to spend looooong periods of time driving, inspecting vehicles and talking to drivers.That's not ALL there is to do in this game though. You can stop ANY vehicle whenever and wherever you want on the autobahn. You can issue speeding tickets, warnings, fines for offences and defects, and of course arrest the serious law breakers for being under the influence of drink or drugs, or for trying to evade you when you go to pull them over. There's a variety of offences to be found, such as erratic driving, using a mobile phone while driving, not wearing a seat belt, and driving an overladen vehicle.You can choose from either a marked or unmarked patrol car each time you leave the police station, and attend accidents, investigate reports of suspicious vehicles, and even pursue and recover stolen vehicles. In the boot/trunk of the car you'll find traffic cones, axle scales, and road warning lamps for securing accident scenes. You'll even be working a mix of day and night shifts.Sooo, let's wrap this up.Pros:- Half decent graphics- Variety of events and incidents to keep you entertained- Extensive procedures for each task- Ability to decide what action to take when dealing with drivers- 40km of Autobahn to patrol- Promotions awarded as XP increasesCons:- Blue light is distracting during in-car view- Documentation in the game is displayed in German (licenses, waybills etc)- Vehicle controls aren't great when using keyboard, so a wheel is recommended- An understanding of German traffic law is almost essential with a few of the tasks, as the manual does not explain itThese are just a few thoughts off the top of my head following a few hours of gameplay.In summary, I love this game. It does what any decent simulator SHOULD do. It puts you in someone else's shoes and gives you an insight into a different world. I can see myself playing this for a long time to come, and I personally believe the replay value will be quite high.I only hope the developers might introduce some more scenarios and vehicles over time.If you've been pondering this one. Get it. You won't regret it!			"

												I need some time to get into it. But its fun to control cars on the ""Autobahn"". You can find defects on the cars. Check if the driver has taken alcohol or drugs. There might be car accidents and you're responsible is to check those places.Later on the scenarios get more and more interesting. Pursuits are fun too, Although it's not comparable to a triple AAA game the technical implementation works well.			"

												Terrible. I have a decent computer - it can play Skyrim, Just Cause 2 and Euro Truck Simulator 2 at either Ultra or nearly Ultra settings... except this game - it can manage only on Medium setting otherwise the frame rate drops to 11/s. ""And? Your point being...?"" is probably along the lines of what you're thinking so I shall explain. The graphics are terrible and most certainly nowhere near standard for the price and release year.The next problem is the impossible controls. *Stand next to car door* ""Press F to open"" *Spend 3.5 days aiming at the interior before you get the option to drive car*.*Long loading screen at 45 f/s*.*Turn left gently - back away from the wall you sharply veered into*.*Get onto the Autobahn and head to the scene of an incident after wiping out due to the vague controls and having to restart 5 times* *After having done a 3 day long ceremony for the God ""Wallaubantraun"" you are finally able to step out of the car**6 hours of flipping between controls and the game, you finally manage to talk to someone and find out what happened**Spend ages flipping between controls and gameplay until you flip out, throw your computer out the window.*Another problem is the handling. Hold down right mouse button to look when on foot and then have completely impossible vehicle handling where left may be right and no controls means you'll be turning like a spinning top.I didn't find out too much more after that beyond the game is utterly boring.Games like this have so much potential, but sadly never deliver. Shame.			"

												This was a mediocre game when it was in the early days after the release. Then there were a few updates and it looked like they really care and want to make this game good. Fast forward 3 more months and they released the last update that essentially broke the most important part of the game, the driving ! That was sometime last year and we havent heard anything else from the devs. so my verdict has to be, DO NOT BUY "

												This Game is really fun. The problems with lag can be resolved very easily by turning off anti-aliasing in the options tab. This is very common with many games. There are many controls which are not in any other Police Sim game like this like seperate controls for lights, sirens and pull over. This really helps with the way teh traffic reacts. Top game for a cheap price.			"

												Well its a great game, a little complicated at first when it comes to the controls, but once you get used to them, theres no problem. The game is great, a lot of stuff do happen while on patrol. Its awsome how you can control other vehicules speed, pull people over, respond to car accidents, have to use police radio and everything, if you are looking for a police simulator (its more of a highway patrol style since your on the highway and not the city) you've found it. I strongly recommend this game to those of you who love police simulator games!!!!!			"

												This game was absolutely horrible. If you're desperate for a Police game I would recommend Enforcer: Police Crime Action over this, yeah the game has issues of its own but the game is only $4.99.  Pros--Police sim in a near empty market-You get to pull people over, accept calls-You get to experience life as a Police officer doing various police things -Very detailed aspects of the game-Graphics weren't really badCons--Too complicated, In order to pull people over you have to let the game know you are pulling someone over rather than just putting your lights on. -Driving physics, Horrible.-Not a decent tutorial, you're just kind of put in the game-FireFighter 2014 Quality -Only 2 Police vehicles "

												I decided to get this game after looking for some simulation games.  This looked like a good idea to try out.  I was throughly impressed with the gameplay of this.  Not sure what everyone is complaining about, the most recent update has fixed most of the problems.  The controls aren't too bad, if you set them up the way you want, it makes it very easy.  You do drive a lot, I mean, you are a police officer and if you have ever seen them, they do drive 95% of their day if not more.  I recommend this game to anyone looking for a simulation game with a lot of replay value, Don't let let first hour put you down, keep on playing and do the campaign, it just becomes more fun and interesting!

												If I could sum this game up in just one word it would be 'LAZY'.Now you may say it's impossible to review a game after just one hour, but I did play this when it first came out in order to do a youtube review however, after playing it back then I decided it simply wasn't worth my time.I saw from the 3 updates the devs posted on steam that they had 'made improvements', so I figured, as a police enthusiast, I would check them out. Sadly, nothing felt improved and the word LAZY kept popping into my head at every hair raising turn.So where to start?Firstly, I'll get the good out of the way because that shouldn't take more than a few sentences.As a cop enthusiast, I have to say the game has some elements that are neat and if the devs hadn't been so LAZY, those elements might have led to some interesting events. The ability to stop vehicles, check lights tires, trunk contents etc are all things I'd enjoy doing in a well developed police simulator, but sadly after the first couple of times, they became repetitive and annoying, mainly due to the character interactions which I'll cover in a bit.  I did like that you could follow a vehicle, trigger an observation and things like no seat belt worn would flag up.Ok, now the now on to the bad.Firstly, the optimization is terrible.  My rig which happily plays the latest big budget titles on high settings, managed barely a slide show when I ramped the graphics up to high on this one which is crazy given how pathetic and dated the graphics are. Ultra high is an option, but I could only laugh at the thought. I'll mention the 20 mins I spent on google trying to figure out why I couldn't move my character only to discover you have to disconnect ANY other controller that's attached to your PC.We move on to the game play itself.  The first thing you encounter is the facepalm, and I mean FACEPALM driving mechanics. They are truly terrible.  After treacherously weaving my way on to the autobahn, I suddenly released why the devs focused much of the driving on a repetitive straight stretch of road., though even on this straight road, trying to keep your vehicle in lane isn't without its challenges. For a simulator, I wanted to lead by example, demonstrating good careful driving which sadly I never achieved, quite often using the center barriers like bumper lanes at the local kids bowling plex.Which leads me on the my next issue. The simulation. Of which by the way there is none. In fact, the word 'simulator' should be forcibly removed from the title. Let's start with the basics, and I really to mean 'basics'.There are absolutely zero character animations in this game bar walking and running and even those look terrible.  The simplest and basic animations like getting in and out of your vehicle don't exist. Press F and you teleport from your driving seat to the exterior of your car, and the same in reverse when you get back in.   There are so many simple animations that could have made things a little more immersive such as holding up a radio to your face when speaking dispatch, administering a breathaliser / drug test, taking the drivers papers, checking tires, but nope, that was too far of a stretch for these guys. LAZY!Then there's the actual interactions with the drivers.  The questions you ask and the answers you get are the same word for word rehashed sentences every single time. After only my first 5 or 6 traffic stops, I could literally predict what was going to be said.  There is obviously only one or two responses for each question in the database, so why the devs didn't bother to actually voice them is a complete mystery. Oh wait. LAZY!  If the driver is standing outside his car, which he will be if you're responding to a car accident, he just stands there with his hands pointing out by his sides, penguin fashion. Apparently having them turn to face you when you speak to them was too much of a stretch for the devs. instead they just stare across the autobahn as though you don't exist. LAZY!Now lets not forget interaction with dispatch. Again it's the same rehashed replies, but what annoys me even more is that they are instant. Ask to check ID on someone, they reply the second you click your question. They could hace had you wait a few seconds, perhaps giving the response 'stand by whilst I check for you officer', but no. LAZY!If you arrest someone, there's no cuffs, no animation, no escort to police vehicle,  they just instaport straight into the back seat, and the entire scene including their vehicle and cones you placed just vanishes into thin air.   Even traffic stops were you issue a simple ticket, sees the car just  'poof' and vanish. I mean seriously? Is it too complicated to script it so it drives off, back on to that long cornerless straight road? LAZY!At the start of your shift, you get a female partner who also just appears in your car. She sits there the entire time and NEVER gets out to assist no matter how serious the incident.  LAZY!.  There's no interaction with her, no conversation, nothing. LAZY!Every single one of the so called 'dynamically created' incidents that were given by dispatch on my first patrol took place at a petrol station, the suspect vehicle parked in the same parking spot each time.  To frustrate me more, each time the station was on the other side of the autobahn forcing me to drive past it for a few minutes until I reached an off ramp, only to go back the other way for another few minutes till I arrived at the damn thing. I did this so many freaking times it didn't take me long to realise every single off ramp / overpass / on ramp is exactly the same cut and paste job. Same rocks same Y shaped tree, same stretch of road. LAZY!There's no script that simulates other road users knowing you even exist. Pull out on to the road or switch lanes in front of one and he'll just carry on ignoring your existence until he smacks in to you. LAZY!After inspecting the contents of a vehicles trunk / boot just a handful of times, you come across the same grouped items over and over again. You'll be amazed just how many Germans carry a teddy bear back there. LAZY!The driving controls are dangerous! I'm not talking about the steering here, I'm talking about things like switching your emergency lights on, siren, high beam etc. All done through a point and click menu / sub menu system which you're supposed to do whilst driving your highly volatile death trap on wheels. LAZY.And finally ( could go on by the way). There's the German text you encounter. The game is in english (albeit a German cop sim) but you have to deal with ID's papers and tickets in German and unless you speak the laungage, you'll have no idea what they mean. LAZY!So there we have it. Unless you're a complete and utter law enforcement fanatic, you should avoid this lazy train wreck of a game, in fact, avoid it even if you are!I have precisely 55 mins of game play left for my youtube review before I turn this excuse for a simulator in for a refund.YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

												What can I say? Do you enjoy driving endlessly to find the criminal? And then finding that the F key does not let you out the car? If you do this is the game for you. If like 99.9% of everyone you like the F key for exiting the vehicle buy GTA V instead.			"

												i really wanted to play this game but unfortunately the control mechanics are that insanely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that it is impossible to control your police cruiser at any functionable speed....even with a controller it is horrid.  I come back to it every few weeks or so and try to stick with it but it takes about 10 mins of driving on average 40 kph so i can stay off the barriers lol....after 10 minutes i throw my hands up in despair and close the game...

												Nice Simulation of the workaday life of a police officer on the german Autobahn. You have to handle different scenarios, like car accidents or pursuits. I needed some time to get into all the controls of the game, but after a while it starts to make fun. It looks nice, has a nice soundtrack and it has no speed limits ;)			"

												its not an amazing game, but its decent. if your a big enthusiast of all things emergency services like me you will enjoy this for what it is, what i like the most is doing random traffic stops and going through each thing from speeding to defects and drink driving etc its actually a pretty good system. like i said its not an amazing game, but its halfway decent, and as i said if your emergency service buff you should support every game that is relevent because we need to show its popular and then more and more devs will invest in it.

												I would give it a yes - based on the fact that you can drive around and 'act' as a real police officer - however the actual gameplay could do with a lot of improvement. The driving action itself is pretty tough to control on the tighter corners - so easy to crash into the barriers when leaving a motorway - the car is too over responsive.I get regular freezes on screen that the drive becomes jerky for 10-20 seconds where I pretty much lose control of the car.The dialogue is flat and boring with monotonous steps.The number of buttons I need to press to check speeed and pull somoene over is not the most exciting aspect.A lot of negatives - but still can be fun.

												Absolutely IMPOSSIBLE to control the vehicle, keyboard is about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Tried a USB PS3 style controller and that improved it slightly but the steering doesn’t seem to auto-centre properly or quickly enough, so you end up with a ""tank slapper"" then losing control of the car. I played time and time again with the steering and controller settings but couldn’t get it any better. This could be a brilliant game as the graphics and features are excellent but they need to sort the steering issue out, take a leaf from Grand Theft Auto's steering physics! Not sure what it’s like with a wheel but don’t waste £15 like I did until they sort this out. Unplayable. :(			"

The real police cars would have bumper LED lights but in this game it is only 2 lights on a light bar, not worth the money at all!			"

												This game looks decent. Shame about the controls. There are too many. There's a button to press the handbreak. A button to start the engine. A button to use the radio. a button to select what you want to say on the radio. a button for the lights. a button for the siren. a button to check the speed of vehicles. All these buttons are on the right side of the screen and you have to click them with your mouse while at the same time driving the car!. Also, missions in free rome will say go to this part of the motorway ok? but when you leave the station to head onto the motorway it's in the opposite lane!! and don't even get me started on trying to get into the vehicle itself. You have to try and get the mouse to point to the chair to sit on it but sometimes would open the bonnet or the back door. Then if you want to turn on the blues and twos, you have to go through several button presses to find it all while driving.			"

												Although it takes time to get used to the controls and understand how exactly to get some things done, the concept behind this game is fun. You have the chance to drive around and pull over cars that are misbehaving and simulate the life of a police officer.I have had trouble with controls, so that may be the one downfall in my opinion, but I would recommend this as a good mid-end game simulator.

Its a waste of 20$.But since i dont get a refund i cant really get rid of it.This Games Graphics are limited due to ""Budgets"" Also Limited Missions3 types of missions right now1.Suspious Vechicle - Pretty fun actually2.Car Aciddent - complete utter poop... One guys says (A) the other says(b) then you go back into your car.. Waste of time3.Object Blocking the road- Remove usaully either 4 peices of tire from the road , or a washer machine or plank of wood.The Driving is Absolutey unbearable You literally have to keep hitting ""a"" and ""d"" really fast just to stay in your lane.The animations - Suck..The Developer thinks this is a completed game which really makes me sad..This is honestly Alpha at bestThe Game is Really only good for playing music in the background while your driving, it literally takes up to 20-25 minutes depending on where the mission is . and if its behind you...Its the worst You have to go 5 miles up then turn cross a bridge then go 10 miles back then cross another bridge just to get to the mission that was behind youThe Pursuits are honestly the saddest thing ive ever seenDO NOT BUY IF YOU EXSPECT UPDATES WITH NEW CALLS (its not coming)			"

YouTube™ Video: Autobahn Police Simulator - What's it Worth? 

			Views: 7,641		

			Today I take a look at a new game on Steam for $19.99 - Autobahn Police Simulator. We give it 20 minutes to show us just what it's worth. Is it going to be decent or garbage?		

For more info, see this resonse to Ghostkeeper:To each their own.  You're entitled to your opinion as I am to mine.  But let me share a bit more of my thoughts on this game:  Seeing as there's no tutorial, the game is only semi-openworld, had terrible handling, didn't have proper controller support, and most of the functions either don't work or are completely non-user friendly, so I'd say I gave it a decent run through.  If a game doesn't grab the player's interest in the first 20 minutes of gameplay, then it's not a good game.  That's the approach I have to games and it's what I use to judge them.  This game just falls into the same category as ""Woodcutting Simulator 20XX"" where they don't have a polished and user-friendly product and are putting it out anyway.  Other games like Farm Sim, ETS2, and even Construction Simulator 2015 have a decent engine with a fair amount of gameplay but most importantly, they made it user-friendly to make it enjoyable.  This game felt like work.  I'd rather not have to work to enjoy a game.  Which is disappointing, because I would like to find a good police sim...And if you think that those other sims just got it right the first time:  ETS2 evolved to where it is today, from some really bad truck sims.  Farm sim was a mediocre sim in the early years, but was boosted by community addons.  The problem with the ""Autobahn Police Simulator"" is it's the same company/producers that keep putting one cookie cutter sim after another, and they don't evolve and improve their engine.  They also put very little effort into their userability.Hopefully that clarifies my findings a bit more.  I won't say I'm not biased, because it was fairly apparent what this game was likely going to be like, but I did give it a fair shot to draw me in and it failed to do so.			"

												I don't know how I feel about this game. To recommend or to not. I would say that if you want to get enjoyment out of this game you will have to put many hours into it because I'm sure I didn't see all of the scenarios and they could get better the more you rank up in the game. Did I have fun playing the game yes, but that's only because I was recording for my subs. Do I think that I will ever play this game again? Due to the flaws in the game, no the driving pure laggy hell which is weird because you'll be driving a lot in it. The worst part of the game is the physics they're really bad, but that's expected in a simulator game, right? No, it shouldn't why can't any simulator game do proper physics. The gameplay is fine but not amazing. I would only recommend this to a YouTuber to play on their channel, but in general gaming don't bother. Don't just take my word for it give it a watch. Thank XD

												This game is only worth the money to somebody who likes serious simulators because after 2 hours of gameplay there is nothing new to do as there are only 2 driveable cars and the missions are very repetative			"

												This could be a good game if they sorted the steering out. You simply cannot progress in the game because of the constant crashing and very poor control of the car. Come on, sort the issues out with a patch!			"

												A police simulator has been long over due -- and this game does a good job of filling that niche in the flurry of simulator titles out there!There is a wide variety of things to do, the amout of tasks and attention to detail is staggering. The game features a very friendly tutorial that helps ease you into the gameplay and get you ready to take on the campaign. Or you can just jump into 'free roam' and do whatever you like, right from the start!The gameplay mechanics are friendly and easy to master. Recommended!			"

												Autobahn Police Simulator: Welcome to a very different and original police game on Steam today! Raise the ranks beginning with cadet... or private... I don't know. Take in to detail license, permits, and many more!Graphics: 6/10. The graphics are fairly solid in this game, it's nothing too special. But for this game, it feels like the right balance between TOO good and TOO bad.Gameplay: 6/10. The game is very catchy believe it or not with different variations of violations in the law. You may choose to go undercover, or go casual with your police cruiser. Notice people drifting and pull them over for fatigue, drugs or alcohal. You could even notice if they are on a phone, no seatbelt, speeding, or even just a car violation (such as a flat tire). The game takes into consideration the common laws from around the world. But here's the catch, the writings on the all of the documents they give you, all in German. I don't really read the license and all of that fun stuff, I just assume they are valid. Although the game is in German, it really doesn't get in the way of your entertainment. Oh, did I also mention police chases? Yes, a person could refuse to pull over and that brings you to solve the issue, pull them over the hard way, Despite all of these great things about the game, there is a single flaw. It gets boring after a little bit. You're used to pulling these kinds of people over and there's no story line to the game. You just raise your ranks and have as much fun as you can.Addiction: 3/10, As soon as you play it you're all, ""Oh this is pretty good."" Then maybe after an hour you begin to say, alright this game is not as good as I thought it was, despite it's unattractive price of 20$.Sounds: 8/10, Sounds run smoothly no problems with them. Common police/car sounds.Music: 5/10, Really unattractive intro music right as you enter the game. No music during the gameplay.Lag: 4/10, The lag to this game is insane if you have the default graphics on, I could barely move my dude when I played this. It's an easy fix although, just switch the graphics quality down and most importantly your view distance, then you'd be in good shape.Well, have fun playing. I do not overall recommend this game due to it's lack of willing to play. If this game were to be better, they'd have to expand the gameplay. Overall, my rating is a...5/10.			"

												This game is but it's not worth £14.99! Wait for a deal or get it for much cheaper.It is quite fun and you can have some very funny moments but the steering is extremely hard!If you want to get the full experience from this game then get a steering wheel that you can plug into your PC.There should be less driving and there should be a GPS system that higlights the quickest route from A to B. It should be shown on the mini-map and on the road!Graphics- 4/10Steering- 2/10Braking- 5/10Realism- 7/10Price- 1/10Lights (sirens)- 3/10Average Score- 7.33333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333/10			"

												I really wanted to like this game.  However, it's the first game I've ever felt I needed to ask for a refund from Steam. The car handling is poor. The controls are poor -- I find it undriveable with either joystick or keyboard. Mouse steering is unavailable. The graphics performance is poor -- my machine plays far more complex games in a much higher resolution and far higher frame rate.  It's just not good enough at the cost charged. Much of the interaction with vehicle drivers is railroaded.  Some of the repeated textual replies becomes annoying very quickly. The driveable map is too small and without any real variation. The load times are really too long for the actual game.Sadly, despite wanting to like the concept -- not recommended.			"
