Early Access Review
								I've only put a few hours into this game, but can already tell there's a mountain of possibilities here. Definitely BUY this, support the developers and follow it closely!If you like classic RTS games like Settlers, Majesty or the Anno series, this is a very well-produced hybrid of those in progress. You build a city, manage resource production / distribution, train a military and fight off monsters / other cities. There's also a roguelike, sandbox element in that your city exists on an overworld map with other cities who will trade with you, invade you, or be subject to invasions/raids. Though it's not complete yet, it's clear that the developers have done a good, solid job of building the engine and foundations -- that is to say, from here it seems like a lot of the groundwork has been done and the rest will simply be adding content and features.Features I would like to see implemented in the future:- Greater varience of buildings/skins, or random rotations (at present there is only one ""look"" for houses, for example, which can make blocks of houses which you need lots of, look somewhat bland or boring)- More supply/demand dynamic for trading. Resources often have a relatively set cost that hardly deviates at all. I would like to see something implemented where resources will fluctuate more heavily in price, even between other cities. It makes trading more exciting/dynamic, as currently if two other cities want to buy your resource, they will both largely offer an identical price. I would like to see this fluctuate, so that a player would have to pay attention to trading -- and could even mean that a player running a ""trading village"" could be economically viable, as buying resources low from certain cities and selling high to others at a profit could potentially work.- More permanent overworld map changes as the game progresses. i.e. other cities going to war and ""taking over"" rivals, which would in essence form small ""kingdoms"" (say, a certain NPC city will then own 2 or 3 cities). Also perhaps something like ""invasions"" of other cities from monsters, so that cities would become ""monster citadels"" or ""lairs"" if they are taken over. - More military options (siege weapons, different units (perhaps using shields and swords as resources as well))- Better ""fortification"" options. Right now there are stone walls and stone gatehouses, but only wooden stockades and no wooden gatehouses. This would be a valuable addition.- More monsters, though I think the devs have already mentioned wanting to do this. Goblins, orcs, dragons, etc. etc. etc.Overall though, great game, one of my most favourite in recent memory, and I can't wait until the content starts being more fully fleshed out. There's so much potential here.			"

								There is much promise in the game, and I hope that the developers continue to rework it, but as it stands now, I would not recommend this game.The only way to succeed is to micromanage the economy.  For instance: You have one iron miner, one coal miner, one iron smeltery, one weaponsmith, and one armorers shop.  The net result here is an endless supply of weapons, but absolutely no armor, because the smelted iron goes to the building closest to it, the weapons shop.  You can only make a soldier -- if you have one armor and one weapon.How do you get by this?  Alternatively turn off and on the weapon or armorers shop, to even out the steel distribution.  That is, you need to micromanage everything that happens.  If an invasion is landing tomorrow, and you have a stockpile of axes but no armor, then everything you've created is totally doomed.The poor automated distribution in the economy kills the potential for this game.  Along with this, there are other slightly irrirating bugs: trade system with other cities is convoluted and redundant, it takes a long time to accurately gauge what the output of productive buildings (how many homes to how many crop fields?), the combat is exceedingly difficult on the  easiest level, the tech research trees provide mundane advances that won't help you cope with any of these other problems, soldiers don't react to ""move"" commands when in combat (but only to the ""retreat"" command), among others.

								I can't say this is a game for everyone.  It has a learning curve, and the game is unforgiving.  It is a fun city building game with elements of pre-built in conflict.  Neighbors WILL invade.  you have local unfriendlies that will compete for city space and block access to resources.  but the worst enemy is you.  i had to restart multiple times to get the ""right"" build for my city.  some of the problems with design only become apparent later on in the game.  for example, i built my city in such a way that my peddlers (a food resource distribution node) would not cover the area needed, and i was out of resources to create a new node, but i need more houses to house more workers to.... you get the idea.There are things in the game that are not intuitive (mostly UI issues) that are annoying, more than game breaking.  so be prepared for some tedium.  Overall, i had fun :)			"

								TL;DR: This is Sim-City for beginners, yet with some compexity beyond the surface.This game... Did not expect much of it, because, you know: ""those greenlight games"". Actually - so much fun! This is a decent village simulation game which is drawn greatly, easy to understand, yet hard to master. You got to keep a lot of things together - food, water, bunch of different resources, trades, quests. You build hollow buildings and villagers come to your village looking for work and housing. Forgot about food supply - two hundred starving peasants just pack their stuff and leave you a ghost town behind. Planned a lot of farming and focused on prosperity? BOOM! Plague comes to your village! A lot of tweaks and different structures. A lot of ores to mine. A lot of plants to gather. A lot of Alcohol to brew.At its current state I'd suggest a newbie tutorial, because there is none. I've built 3 or 4 towns to their bancrupcy just because I didn't figure out what should I build to provide food to mah citizens. Great game. I'd lower a price a bit and then it would be a great deal for all sim-city fans.			"

								If you are looking for a challenge you should buy this game! I'm surprised how well it runs, it hasn't crashed once since I got it and I've seen no bugs so far. To be honest, this is the best EARLY ACCESS game I've ever bought. This is how early access should be done. Either way, the game itself has a lot to offer I've only played it for a few hours and still I'm far from reaching the ""end game"". This game is totally worth 15â‚¬ but it gets very frustrating when failing at the easiest difficulty and with not a lot of rivals on. Either I just suck at this game or it's just very hard, but it's going better and better for each game I play.			"

								Genre: city builder Settlers-stylereview: version 0.7.3-------important note----------Hearthlands is not too difficult! Those complaints come from people who play on ""normal"" setting and can't deal with it. Hint: You can set it to ""very easy"" and adjust every other aspect in the settings!------------------------------------------------Hearthlands must have come a long way in the past couple of months because I can't see any of the mentioned negative points. This game is pretty fantastic by now. People complain about the difficulty. Well, that's more of a misunderstanding. Your neighbours will bully you and eventually invade you if you don't build up defences. That's how it should be btw.So don't just build a farming community and expect to be left in peace. Build some troops.If you don't feel like fighting, then you can comfortably set the a.i. to passive mode. You can also improve relations by trade and other means.You can also select a sandbox mode. You can set up the game any way you like. Difficulty, number of opponents, kind of dwellings...You can select 1 of 4 cultures to play as. The options are huge.Hearthlands even feels polished by now. You finally have a zoom function which I imagine must have sucked without. The game runs absolutely stable. There's so much to do and it's just so much fun. Can't believe this has been under the radar for such a long time.The devs are providing frequent updates, so it's gonna get even better!rating: 8.5/10			"

								Genius.  I haven't had this much fun since ""Sim City 2000,"" and this game is superior.  Better than ""Banished"" as the end-game isn't pointless economic tedium, but RTS / TD feudal city building.  I love this game.  I have spent 100s of hours playing before launch testing and on Desura, & still can't wait to play again.  The progression from city building and farming to battling graveyard ghouls feels right.  The pacing is pleasing, not overwhelming like an RTS.  One can actually get to know their villagers a bit before they are destroyed years later.  ""Hearthlands"" also lets the player design their city a bit more openly, providing awards for evironmental prowess and properly spaced villages.  The restrictions are still there, but the player has room to add a few trees and such without it hurting the economy;  it in fact boosts it.  If you miss the good old days of simulation cities but don't want to deal with the new age bullsh!t being pushed by the AAA publishers, this is a great game and company to support.  Very few games make me smile, give me glimmers of happiness... this game does just that by evoking my childhood imagination for sim cities once again.  ""Hearthlands"" is the perfect compliment to my other work -art- as it inspires & amuses.  Just how many little villages didn't make it?  How many millions slaughtered just so that we could survive on?  This is a great break from the intensity of ""Crusader Kings"" yet still one can entertain the same novel characters & events in their own storybook style sandbox.   --  Oldschool Respect -- Critics of the graphics should understand the homage to the early era of sims & keep in mind the appeal to a generation which utilized their imaginations more than their eyes.  Tolkien's favorite rendering of his books was of the Hobbit and Golem doing riddles in the dark, an abstract with few details.  Tolkien said he loved it because it left more to the imagination of the beholder.  That is why I love ""Hearthlands,"" how it inspires me to a better state of mind.			"

								I played this game on Linux in Early Access and is without bugs. I had a resolution problem that made it unplayable, but the dev was quick to help me fix it. It is cute, played for a few hours (10 or 20 don't know why steam shows 2 hrs) as the nords. I liked the fact that nords can't grow crops. The resource management is great and factions are well ballanced. Somehow I got the impression tht you can actually conquer the map townby town, when I realized that I am wrong I lost the interest in playing. The game has nothing that tops Caesar 3 for example, but for the nostalgics it is worth dropping a penny for. I'd reccommend you to hold your breath until it comes out of early access, nothing to do with the current game just a general advice.			"

								This is your Settlers, old schoold rts game served just as we like it.I could spend an hour writing review of it but the line above is just all you need. Game is still in developement so keep this in mind. Honestly speaking though i don't expect much more then already is in it. If you liked classic settlers game here it is, bigger, better, more badass. Without unnecessary solutions, focus is about creating great self-sufficient or trade based or both village.There is only one bad thing about strategy games as good as this one :When you start playing, don't fool yourself, it's won't be an hour at evening. When you start playing at evening then most likely will be no sleep for you that night !Definitely recommended !FrankCastle51 out !PS.

								For major part it's just a copy of Zeus: Master of Olympus. Most things work exactly the same way but there are several different industries, different buildings to built and material chains to construct. Though if you like Zeus then you are sure to like this one too. Definitely enjoyed building new types of industry and gathering resources. Tutorial could use more expanding though, needs explanation about how trading and military work. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys more town building focused rather than military focused town building games, as you can choose to pretty much turn off any kind of fighting, and to anyone who likes Zeus, Pharaoh and Emperor: Rise of the middle kingdom type of games.

								Pretty fun city builder, with deep supply chains, trading, monster raids, army building. Looks easy enough in screenshots but has a nice depth and lots of freedom in how you build your town. You can make it as easy or as hard as you like, and there are different factions you can play as which focus on certain troop and building types. Maps are vast and the beautification factor is a nice mechanic to make the OCD builders and min/maxers happy while trying to get the most out of their layouts. Surprised at the quality so far, in my two hours with it I already see myself playing a hell of a lot more of this than I ever did Banished. Old school meet the new.			"

								If ""Caesar IV"" and ""Banished"" had a baby, ""Hearthlands"" is what it would be called.  It's like them in the sense that you don't actually control any of your subjects...you build structures and watch them go about their daily lives.  Hey, don't knock it if you haven't tried it...there's a reason why purchasable ""ant farm kits"" are a thing.  With that said, there's quite a bit of resource and city management involved.  I suppose there's a little bit of ""Age of Empires"" in their too, what with the ability to build armies and manage diplomacy.  All in all, great for folks who enjoy ""Majesty"", ""Settlers"", or any of the above aforementioned games.

Early Access Review
								Im kind of torn apart by this game. I would like to recommend it, but only because of it being a game in a genre with not many choices and not because its a really good game.I also realized, that there arent many negative reviews rating this game in its finished state, so i will have a go for it. Im sorry that its so long, i will start with positive, follow with negative and end with a resumÃ©e.At first the positive things:1.) Its a city builder with mechanics similar to games i loved playing. Such as Emperor Rise of the Middle Kingdom, Caesar and Pharao. It uses the *Walker-Mechanic with doing so, i kind of hated this mechanic and rather prefer a hybrid of area of effect and walker. (*Explanation for what Walker are scroll to the end.)I have to say though, that while having the walker mechanic in this game, it at least is done well and limited to an acceptable amount. Also some buildings have an area of effect type mechanic behind, such as gatherers or hunters, watchtowers or miners.2.) Its deep. Not only the economic aspect of it is deep enough with many different goods, it also offers a diplomatic aspect similar to the ones in the old City Builder games (traderoutes, attacking/invading, being attacked, giving gifts or handing out goods to increase popularity with factions). On top of it you have to deal with several neutral factions, such as undead, goblins, wild animals and other creatures. I have to say though, that it is a bit unbalanced in that aspect. You can build your city and get no problems for at least an hour playing, suddenly the game decides to spawn a pack of wolves near your city. A pack means about 12 wolves, which are so strong that killing even one needs a strong military force and several towers. And sometimes the game decides to spawn 3,4 or even 8 of these packs in a timeframe of 5 minutes. They are then simply ripping your town apart. More about that later.3.) Several factions with different strengths and weaknesses to play, many customization options for your session, such as how many opponents you have, how you look or how the gameworld is made. Also starting conditions. All of that easily gives dozens of hours to play and each attempt will be different if you wish.Now the negative things that even might drive me away:1.) It looks HORRIBLE: I mean really bad. It starts with you getting into a main menu screen having a picture that would even look bad for a game from 1990. I would even say that games like Knights and Merchants had a better looking and higher resoluted menu screen. Point is, you could overlook that if it was only this, but the whole game looks just like from at least 15 years ago. And not in a nostalgic way. I can be bothered to play a Pharao with a 800x640 resolution and no widescreen or zoom options, but at least the sprites in these old City-Builders look good and the overall presentation is well done.Hearthlands sadly has a horrible presentation. Animation quality of each character is abysmal, the colour palette...i question the choice and cant believe a sane person would call the whole package to look good. In no way. This problem goes on with all presentation aspects you can think of. The sounddesign is mediocre at best, music isnt noticeable and far from good, the menu layout and UI is...not well designed. In the end you have a complete package where every aspect of the game is literally just ugly for eyes, ears and your brain. I think the only nice thing to look at is the world map, but you maybe spend 10 seconds at most in that window every 10 minutes. If at all...2.) No multiplayer: Emperor already had multiplayer, it can be done and quite easily even. And the City-Builder Genre screams for a game like that with multiplayer. Its still a good game without, but it could have delivered a unique experience here. I know such a feature costs alot, time, money and workforce. So i hope it will be something to be considered for a follow up title, see more in the ResumÃ©e.3.) Diplomacy seems shallow at places: You can get a good stance with each faction in this game, hand them out resources when they ask you a favor, gift them stuff and have trade agreements. But dont give them what they ask for only one time and you will instantly get a notification telling you that they invade you in no time. I had a game where i built up my city, traded with people, gifted them resources and helped them out several times. My popularity was up and running. Suddenly the game decided to throw about 30 wolves at my city. I wasnt prepared and had to build wooden towers, train soldiers and build watchtowers. During a quite long fight that didnt want to end because the game threw more and more wolves at me, a factionleader asked for 16 logs. Logs normally are easy to produce and i could hand them out, but not while having to build wooden towers to defend my people from extinction. I rejected. When i was nearly done defending, killing the last 4 wolves, the notification came. You are going to be invaded. Great, so i can forget that session. Btw, here a multiplayer mode could help alot. Not only would i deal with real people that arent totally irrational, but also could a friend you play with aid you with ressources or soldiers. As could you do that for him/her.ResumÃ©e:Its a solid game in and of itself. It has enough to keep you busy, is deep enough to stay interesting and has content to fill many hours. The genre is lacking anyway these times, and leaving people who like strategy and build-up games with not many choices. So its not that hard to fill this gap with the only competition being the Anno-Series, Lethis or the old games of this genre. But thats where it starts to fall off, even in such a ""dying"" genre, its quality is questionable. Mostly its look and presentation is driving me away. If it was looking as good as Lethis Path of Progress i would call it a great game you have to buy. The lack of other features, such as a campaign, missions and quests and most important a multiplayer feature, just push me over the line of calling it a very flawed game that fills a gap in an under-represented genre. I have one hope and advise to the developers:Do a follow up. Hire an artist and do the same game with the same ideas, but then do it with someone slightly talented drawing some better characters, buildings and so on, so it looks better.Get better animation quality, maybe also get a unique setting. Then implement multiplayer on top of it with all that is needed to play with at least one other person and i wouldnt hesitate to buy this game for full price and call it game of the year. I think you are talented in some aspects and the overall idea and the mechanics, the content and depth are really good. Get presentation to an acceptable level and you are up and running to maybe help this genre to new glory. *For those not knowing it: Walker are ""NPCs""/People/Worker in the game sent out to distribute services. So people in the game dont get food with visiting a store and buying it or getting it from a storage, you have to build a deliverer, which walks around in the city to bring food to people. This applies to all services. Problem with it is, that you have to look whether all houses get their stuff, which can turn out to be fiddling with the city layout and sometimes be bothersome. In older games of this genre you for example built a temple, which spawned a priest walking through your city. Whenever he passed a house/building he decreased the demand of the service he offers, in this case belief. The whole point of city builders was to place each building in a way, that the spawned walker reached every building in time before negative things happen. Buildings could collapse, catch fire, people catch the plague or their houses downgrade because they didnt get the goods they needed. This turned City Builder into puzzles, where you could build after a maximum effective layout.			"

Some bugs are present and work is needed (e.g. invaders trapped on islands at the edge of the map). I also didnâ€™t like how combatants walk in a line and engage in battle one by one. 6 directional movement and roads would be good, so this game isnâ€™t full of 90* zig-zags. An ability to zoom in and out would be nice too. As with many good single-player games some form of multiplayer would be awesome, but itâ€™s not practical in this case anyway.-----Lots of choice for different situations (e.g. severals choices for alcoholic needs, and you can use diplomacy or a strong defence).It was a welcome challenge to finetune my city. But more information needed about industry requirements e.g. how much livestock and crops are needed to support farms and how many farms and resource gathering structures are needed to support production of food other goods) would be mice.-----If you donâ€™t know this you either build too much or too little of certain things and you canâ€™t plan your city properlyYou end up with a weak links in process i.e. inadequate supplies of a single material needed to produce items for you cityI had to figure out ratios by trial and error.However in the end it was very satisfying to build a relatively large city and tame it. With 20+ hours invested into this game Iâ€™ve definitely got my moneyâ€™s worth			"

 TLDR: Buy Gnomaria. It's cheaper, way more features, and succeeds everywhere this game fails.I would like to put a huge disclaimer here before writing a scathing review. Some points.. 1. The game is in alpha, there still can be a huge amount of improvements made and the game will only get better. 2. I don't really hate the game it's not really that bad. See my review for Skyshines Bedlam, now that is a crappy game! But given the option to put a only a thumbs up or a thumbs down, I have to choose thumbs down at this time. but it's barely a thumbs down, mind you. I'm simply comparing it to other games (like Gnomaria) and it just falls short is all.3. The dev is very active, working hisâ™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥off, and I do have hopes for this game. Plus I love supporting small companies, so don't regret buying it. 4. I bought this game simple for the fact it had a 90% positive rating. That's why when playing it and finding some glaring issues, I was a bit surprised. 5. $10 is pretty good value. Once it get's more polished I can see this being quite favorable. So I can't hold that against it. In fact quite the contrary. I wish more games in this price range existed.Ok now for stuff I don't like this game. -Music. It's simply horrid. you turn if off immediately. There is this chicken noise also that chimes every 5 seconds, making you pull your hair out, especially if you're wearing headphones.  2/10 - Combat. First, there is a goblin that takes a beeline path from his base to yours. The same exact path every time. At first you have to chase him with the couple troops you can muster, but then you just end up placing a tower in his path to destroy him. Next, a sewer opens up in some random spot near your town, and 3 jelly monsters pop out of it. You just park your troops on top of this to stop them. But since everything is on 5 minute timers, you just leave some troops on top of this forever and let them level up. Then unless you pay out the nose to the other factions demanding constant crap from you, they will eventually attack. This isn't much of an issue though, because they just show up on the edge of the map and stand there until you can get around to killing them. Or you can just leave them out there and completely ignore. After you raise an army, you think ""Hey I should go attack my enemies"". So you pull up the combat screen, say which enemy you want to atatck, how many troops you want to send, and then receive a message you lost. You don't actually get to see the battle or know how you lost, you just lose. It does say the power level of the enemy to be ""35"" and mine to be ""65"", but how many troops you need to send after a level 35 enemy or why you even lost is a mystery.  I can conceed that perhaps if I played long enough to get to power level 300, it may be possible to beat a level 35 enemy, but not seeing battle or anything other than ""you lost"" is kinda a turn off and not much fun. Plus you can only have 10 (I think) total squads, and I was at the max. But perhaps you can send in only expensive horseman to win and not a a mix or archers, axeman, and pikeys like I did. But honestly it was so infuriating sending my entire army in to squash an enemy and just getting a message ""you lose"", I never actually attempted it a 2nd time. I just never saw the point.Then a troll spawns on the map and starts killing your new arrivals as they walk right by his hole and you think ""Okay, now it's on!"". Did I mention there is only 4 troop types? You send the troops in and attack the troll. you notice one guy getting pummeled is an archer and maybe he should retreat. Nope can't move him. Hey I should have my swordman form a defensive line in front of the archers. Nope, everyone just stays in some ramdom cluster jumble, zero control. You basically just watch it unfold and do nothing.  2/10 - Resource Management. Now this is where you would expect the game to shine but sadly it doesn't. You quickly learn that you need to be around metal, and you need to get rank 3 mining (underground) before you exhaust the metal or you will never get any more, ever. Then you basically err on the side of caution and stash as much food and wood away as you can while slowly building up commodities like boots and pillows. There was a couple others, but I cant recal. oh yeah chairs! There aren't a lot of options. If you do get a surplus of anything, you just sell it off, but the interface is so clunky and tedious, it's usually easier to just toss up more storage as you will eventually need the goods. But this is definitely the funnest part of the game.  5/10 - Graphics. Meh they're simple but unless you didn't look at screenshot you expect this. But sprite based animation is so easy to change you really get upset that nothing is done, they walk around and that is it. Nothing like planetbase where they put their hands up in a storm to shield their eyes, or Gnomaria where they get injured and bleed or lose a leg and walk around with a pegleg or... you know... status changes to make it interesting.  But I do like the house designs and artwork, so would rate this the highest part of the game honestly. And it's alpha, so I say it's off to a good start. For what it is, I would go   8/10. "

								I am a big fan of city building games and this title seems to be quite interesting addition to the genre. I enjoyed food nutrition system (you can grow turnips but it will not be too efficient, so better to produce wurst using the same turnips). Production chains are pleasantly sophisticated, this aspect of game can be a bit complicated for players not familiar with titles that inspired Hearthlands (Zeus, Caesar and some aspects of Majesty), but I think those complications actually are a big benefit of the game as they will challenge experienced gamers. Graphics is not the strongest side of Hearthlands but I think its OK for strategy game. I hope developer will add campaign mode and bigger maps option (if it is technically possible) as future improvements were promised.			"

								This game is a very well-executed take on the city-building genre.  At its core, it plays similar to SimCity, but it takes the concept in new directions.It's easy to get into, and there's a lot of depth.  The tutorial is straightforward and quick, which is nice; it doesn't hit you with unwanted dialogue like many tutorials do.The gameplay is set up in a way such that new concepts are introduced at just the right pace: after you've produced enough food for your townspeople, they start asking for other luxuries like alcohol, furniture, and boots.  Amusingly, they put alcohol at a higher priority than everything except food.  Once you have a production line set up for the resources they want, their houses automatically get upgraded, and you continue onto their next wishes.  The pacing is great.As time goes on, AI-controlled opponents will start to interact with you.  This gives you some options for trading, so you can get rid of excess resources in exchange for the resources you want.  They also apparently attack you, and you can build weapons for defense, but I haven't experienced that yet since I've only played for an hour so far.			"

								After only two nights of playing intesely, here's my summary:Buy this game! It's awesome!I've gotten pretty sceptical over early access games in the last year. This game, nevertheless, is already in a really good shape.So, what's this game about?In Hearthlands, you build a town. You place buildings, build paths and after a short while, settelers arrive. They fulfill jobs in buildings you placed automatically â€“ pretty much like in oldschool games like Settlers. Later in the game, military defense becomes a thing. You play on randomly generated maps. There's no campaign yet (which i personally don't need anyway) but a tutorial, that's already well done.What's my resume?In my two nights, i've not encountered any bug yet. The game looks really like the developers have taken this one seriously and the game already looks really ""releasable"".It is also already really complex. For dudes like me, who like managing complex economic systems, i definately recommend this game a lot! It has a really high replayability value and you always think about a new way to approach the next try and optimize.It is also really challenging. Not only is the economic system so well done, that you can succeed and fail equally depending on your build order. It also challenges you with military attacks from wolves and KIs later in the game.So overall Hearthlands is a really interesting and hooking game! Recommended!			"

This is really nothing to do when you have iron and coal mines. You win, you have multiple forces, expandive trade goods (iron), can attack neighbors and kill all enemies on the map. This game really need complicated 'wonder of the world' like resource intensive pyramids at Pharaoh.5.

I had many trade routes set up where I was primarily selling resources to other towns. I had defenses put in place. My houses were evolving since I kept creating what was needed to produce things like furniture, clothes, etc. Was no crime, people seemed happy, and my town was growing larger and larger.*Troll wakes up and destroys my wimpy towers. I lacked military so was helpless to stop him as he murdered all my villagers.*Quickly tried to build my coal and iron industries so I could create weapons and armor needed to create an army. *Plague hits my town while troll is still eating my people.Rage quit10/10 would rage quit againTo sum it up this is Tower Defense on steroids.The steroids in this case being a massive city.

If you are not into this route you can play on easy and free city build to create good looking cities with difficult supply chains.Focus on creating supply lines equal to what they consume.  Use all the available menus to check consumption and supply to build good sized cities.I was also suprised the game was updated as well very soon after I bought it.

								A beautiful combination between old-school Sim City and The Settlers franchise, boasting hand-drawn buildings set in a randomly generated map. Four different cultures offer different production lines and military preferences, which offers some replay value through mastering resource management in other ways, as well as the political map which allows the player to trade, do battle, or simply ignore other rulers - whilst building a battle-ready settlement can take time and energy, it offers a meta game to an otherwise well-polished city builder. However, I would not place much emphasis on combat at this point in development; whilst functional and fitting in with the game's mechanics, it is very much an afterthought compared to the impressive peaceful features of Hearthlands but I'm sure this will change in time.One of the most promising Early Access titles on Steam.

								I've only played a few hours of this so far, but what I've experienced so far has been encouraging.The game is a good city-builder, and that's largely what it is.  RTS elements are there, but it's basically a medieval city building simulator in the vein of Caesar and similar games.The good thing about this one, is that when your production of one resource or another falls off, it doesn't completely cripple your infrastructure.  Oh, having a lack of resources or medicine or food can and will have deleterious effects on your populace, but it won't start a domino effect that results in complete failure.  Therefore, the pressure isn't as overwhelming as games like Cities Skylines.  This is a much lighter experience compared to other city builders, but that makes it more fun as there's less emphasis on micromanagement.  You CAN focus on micromanaging if you want, but it's not entirely necessary.  The options are very flexible, with options for stress-free play, like disabling antagonists or monsters on your home map.Of course, being that this is developed by a small team, the graphics aren't as intensive as many modern city builders developed by larger studios, but the art is very well-done in my opinion.   But then, I like pixelized older-style  colorful graphics.There's some ability to craft your mayor/King's identity, naming him, choosing a face and hair style and also a forboding nickname/surname like the Corrupted or whatever you like.Anyway, from what little I've played of the game, I look forward to full release of the systems they've advertized as being on the way.  Really hoping this doesn't go the way of other early access titles.			"

								I love city-building, resource production games and this game fits nicely into that genre.  While it brings many interesting systems that are frequently overlooked in other games (including combat, magic, RPG elements, and world diplomacy), Hearthlands still feels too unbalanced at this point.  Neighboring nations ask for too much (even on Very Easy) and will invade and destroy your city on a whim.  Production chains are unclear and while there is plenty of information at your disposal, I never felt like goods were flowing like they should.  Recommended if on sale and you like this genre.  Not yet recommended otherwise.  I will keep playing and update review if I overlooked anything.PROS+ Adds interesting concepts to the city-builder genre including diplomacy, trade, and military+ Many options for creating new games to your liking+ Lots of spells and technologies to research and unlock+ Rival countries and local monsters add much needed depthCONS- Graphics are plain and uninteresting- Resource production is confusing and unclear- Production chains are unbalanced; either never enough or always too much- One wrong move and your entire city can be completely destroyed (frequent Rage Quits)- I frequently experienced more frustration than fun- Other games achieve this formula much better (Banished, Anno 1404, etc)			"

This is what turned me away initially. Normal will have your city destroyed an hour in, when the AI has 30 troops and you have 4, or if any at all. Switching to easy made this child's play, which got boring pretty fast. Hopefully they can change the normal mode to meet between the current easy and normal.- It's obviously early access, so there are some things missing (like you get magic points but can't do anything with them)			"

								Hearthlands is a casual game with a fair amount of replayability. It takes a fair amount of thought, less clicking and more thinking. I enjoy the agression/peace options, and trying to balance a city so that it can run without interference. Some of the badges are great, and some are very hard to get. I like the sandbox-like aspect of the game best.Most of the glitches have been ironed out by now, and the designers are very resposive, but sometimes bug fixes make new bugs when you load old games, and some of those loading bugs can cost you half your city if they delete all your peddler tents or whatever, so if you come back to an old game read the blog before you load it.

								Fans of Pharoah, Caesar, and Emperor will instantly be familiar with the gameplay and general gist of Hearthlands.  And I think that's a good thing.  The first three games I mentioned are all still very playable, and just as engaging as they were years ago... and Hearthlands is carrying on that tradition.  The graphics are charming if a bit cartoonish... as soon as I saw the red/white mushrooms I thought of Smurfs and a flash of horror crossed my brain... but that's fine.  The tutorial is quite helpful, and does a good job of easing you into the increasingly complex world of city-building and chains of production.I can already feel myself reaching for some graph paper to plot out optimum city planning, which is something I did with Caesar... which in itself is a pretty big compliment.  I'm interested to see what else gets added in to the game down the road.  This game has the potential to be another great time sink.			"

								Very good resource mgmt game. I play it often. They roll out changes and updates and respond to fan requests which is something many developers do not do. The only improvement I could see from here (and I may just have missed it) is a way to see where peddlers, tax collectors, minstrels, etc are actually covering. They do have a range when you set them down but don't effectively cover that range so it would be good to be able to see where you would need to add them. But that is a relatively small annoyance in an otherwise great game.			"

I've been putting off firing up this game because it's still in EA but just couldn't resist anymore as I was looking for something chilled and have been dying to play it (plus according to the developer the 0.6 release could have been 1.0).  The game is fun, stable and very deep.  Only reason I was able to stop playing was because my army revolted and started detroying my city, otherwise I'd probably still be here in the morning.Can see I'm going to sink many tens of hours into this title			"

								I've only spend about 8 hours in this game and I'm still learning about it.  I really appreciate how customizable the settings are.  Sometimes I'm looking for something relaxing to ""fiddle"" with rather than a challenge.  You can set this game to be either.  So far I only have one complaint  It's a little thing, but it's really bugging me.  Please make the keyboard short cut keys a toggle.  I hate having to reach for my mouse every time I want to close a screen out.  Thank you for designing a great game.			"

								Fun game reminiscent of the old Impressions Games city-building series, adding a few extra things like Research, Spells and different nations/factions/tribes? to pick from, each with their own pros, cons and economy.The tutorial is a lengthy but rather narrow overview of the gameplay/objectives, I feel it could be worked on a little bit as newer players and those unfamiliar with the likes of Pharaoh, Caesar et al, will finish it only to get steamrolled in the actual match by hostile neighbours or a failed attack on a mob spawn. Yes, there is a learning curve and the game will remind you of that during your first matches, but if you persevere there is a great sense of accomplishment from getting your little hamlet to a bustling city.Each nation has a playstyle (due to economic differences and buffs/penalties) and I suggest you try each of them before you decide on which one you feel most comfortable with to strengthen your strategy with it before trying more ""challenging"" ones.Matches will often start with players scattered in a continent. Each player is confined to a set area littered with hostile mobs and resources. You must develop your economy and military, and protect your town from goblins, invaders and the occasional undead. There's no direct control over population or units. Players only interact with each other through trade, requests for goods and invasions. By players I mean AI, as there is no Multiplayer mode.Sound is ok, the songs are MIDI-esque but certainly fitting.The graphics are ok and they do a good job of supporting the fantasy setting along with the music.The game is frequently updated and I look forward to update this review as development goes on.If you know IG's series and have an itch for something similar, you might want to take a look at this game, otherwise I think it might take you a while to get into the game to really enjoy it.I can't say it is bad, but it is certainly not for everyone. I liked it, tho and hope to see it grow into something of an indie spiritual successor to Pharaoh. 7.5/10			"

								For some reason, I had no Internet when I was playing this game, so Steam didn't record it, but anyway, I'll do my first review of a game ever.I recommend this game to anyone who likes City Building games and Strategy. Well, at least, I will recommend it in the future. Here's a few problems:- Since this is still an unfinished game, there isn't any good tutorial- The game's civilizations are not balanced. I have found that playing with Eastern is by far the easiest way to play.- Some limitations of the game are a bit annoying. For example, everybody should be able to fish. There is no geographical exceptions to fishing usually. Everybody used to fish because it was available as a source of food.- The game is EXTREMELY HARD or COMPLETELY EASY. The difficulty meter is broken I'm telling you. Unless nothing costs a thing, it can get really hard. Everybody starts being mad with you all at the same time, even if you trade a lot.- I often feel like the guys that deliver the stuff just deliver food or something. Everybody needs beer or something and since there's only 0.1 of food left, he decides to deliver food instead, which ends up causing the houses to devolve.- I have seen a few bugs in the flag colour selections. I try to switch colours, but then it switches the logo, and when I want to select white and I'm at black, I need to pass by yellow, which switches the other colour, so I have to go all the way back to black, select the other colour, etc.- Getting a steady income is actually really hard. When you start making soldiers, making enough money to pay for them all is really hard. Apart from taxes and trade, there's no income, if you're an Easterner.- Sometimes, I get overloaded with a bunch of resources. In my last gameplay, I had over 500 wurst. I was selling all the meat I could, but I had to make wurst to make my people eat it, but then there was too much food and all. The problem here is that, we can't throw away resources or sell them at a reduced price to ""nobody"".- Other countries start with soldiers and get a lot of them really fast, whilst it takes ages for us and we have none in the beginning.The list goes on and on, but as I said, this is an alpha. However, at the moment, it is playable, enjoyable and really challenging. I think it is paving its way to a really good game. This could be an awesome game if it could be played in multiplayer too.

								Well... 2.5 out of 5 stars so far. I understand this is beta, but it's really difficult to get thru more than a few years worth of growth without something catastrophic happening and destroying your progress. Given how slowly things develop, this is extremely frustrating! I want to be able to actually play some of the game without having to divert to 'god mode'. If folks are just supposed to mess around with this for 20 minutes, it needs to be waaaaaay cheaper than $15.What I don't like: as soon as you hit go, the calendar is ticking, but it can take months for immigrants to make their way across the map to your city. I think time should start when they step on a road, or get within X number of spaces.Only male leaders??? Rly?What I do like: you have to think about what you grow or build when, and sync up all your systems so they flow one into another. Digging the 16 bit look.What I want: more options for changing details of civilizations, FEMALE LEADERS (fer xrists sake...)Pro tip: start your city as high north as you can, as all your immigrants will come from the northern edge of the map.

								The game is rather meh. Not bad, but doesn't really capture me either.There is some odd balances in the game, for instance a lot of enemies on the map, but they don't do much, and if you attack them, they will either kill you, or you are already strong enough and have already won the game, and can stop playing.It also really hard to figure out what is in demand and how much, probably not helped by the fact it is very fluid, since building upgrade and downgrade automatically, so they will survive with too little, but always demand more.The trickiest part of the game is that buildings lose rooms when downgrading, so you can get into a downward spiral where you lose rooms, which loses you workers, which means you can't fix let alone fullfill the needs of building, etc. etc. This can be rather annoying, but is also the only real challenge in the game. The other challanges either didn't matter or was instant death.Parts the game are basically dead at this point. To get to the point where you can research and use magic, you have to be so far ahead nothing on the map, or coming onto the map can challenge you, so you can never really use it before you have already won.I played on Linux and it worked great, though only when launched from the console, for some reason it refuses to launch from Steam, so be aware of that.

								Hearthlands can offer some fun on management, but I'm sorry to say that I couldn't find much of it, besides generic city building.And here's the main problems that I found: 1. I couldn't find much to do on the map (to me, the largest map available is still small) beyond my city, except for killing minor villains (all of them look ""minor"", with no big secrets, no labyrinthic constructions, no intricate plots etc., they have nothing that could arouse curiosity or ambition). Furthermore, it lacks interactions options with non-human enemies (there's none, practically). 2. The best part of the game, the management, can be very confusing and unintuitive. Here's two exemples:  a) first, I started building some farms in the beggining (following the tutorial's orientation) but soon I couldn't manage to satisfy the city's hunger. I kept building them farms and waiting for next harvests. But the more I built farms, the more I needed houses; and the more I built houses, the more the hunger grew. That's not just a noob story, that's ilogical and will remain ilogical, because the game didn't provide any explanation. b) On late game, I had five buildings producing furniture and that wasn't sufficient, although I had enough peddlers and I knew that only two buildings producing booze were enough to satisfy the city. Why two buildings procuding booze were enough and five buildings producing furniture weren't enough? did I need ten building producing furniture, to satisfy +-20 houses? Again, the game didn't clarify the least of what was happening.Maybe I missed smtg, but I'm really inclined to say that there are better options out there than Hearthlands.			"

No worries, there's always tomorrow.The progression is fun, the tutorial is useful, and it's certainly the kind of game where you can do a few things, then watch it for a bit while it progresses (my favourite kind of game, to be honest.Worth the asking price, without a doubt.

								 THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE EARLY ACCESS PORTION OF THE GAME!   The Concept of the game is great, it's pretty much like all city builders. I feel though the layout and map generation is lazy. There's a lack of features and I don't feel like everything is properly categorized. You have over 20 different tabs, and the map itself is normally filled half-way up with houses! The progression of the city is way to quick, and since you can't rotate the buildings yet, you normally want to start on the left side so everything can look right! It feels like it's closer to farmville but speed-up. In the end this game is not worth $15!			"

								Did you enjoy Caesar & Pharaoh ? Do you want nice buildings and godawful characters and citizens ?Do you appreciate lunatic neighbours and stealing goblins ? Then Hearthlands is what you seek. Get back to 2002 game design right now for 20â‚¬ and forget about having your hand taken. You'll learn by making mistakes, sometimes after a good 40 mins of gameplay, and it ll be too late, because it's something you should have anticipated since the very beginning of the game. This is a small ripoff of an old concept for a 20. Playable, but I truly hope some graphisms are placeholders, because they are ugly as it can be (Colin's bear animation ugly).TL;DR : Inequal graphism quality. Gameplay is good but info on what's going on is bad. Not worth 20â‚¬.			"

This one atleast has vibrant colors and cute graphics to make it worth looking at while I FAIL. lolEdit: I have been reading some of the other reviews and I do not have the same problems. After I restarted my Mac I did crash nearly as often. I am on today and going to play on my laptop (windows) to see the difference. I have played many hours and really like this game more than my other SIM/Strategy games at this point. It just holds my interest more.			"

								Neat city builder with cute graphics and sound gameplay mechanics based on producing and distributing a nice variety of goods. The combat part is sub-par and monotonous currently, but even with this limitation, the game can be a good time sink even in peaceful mode. I'm actually surprised Hearthlands hasn't got more attention.			"

								I love city builders and this was great. this game is exactly what it claims to be. Sure there is a bit of a learning curve and you might have a few failed kingdoms and restarts before you figure it out but to me that's half the fun. Having ""beaten"" it once I can't say I'll be rushing to do it again but I'm sure I will come back to it when i'm in the mood for this type of game. "

								It's like a successful mesh between Majesty and a SimBuilder game (with modern elements mind you , you can actually micro-manage the eco flow unlike oldschool simbuilder i.e. Ceaser). I haven't played it too much but seems like I would put 20h+ into it . Very stable. Presentation is pretty bad but hopefully they will update the assets (video assets are actuallty quite nice , but the audio is really really bad atm) sometime in the future . Kudos to the developers.p.s. Played this on Linux with the integrated video card (Intel) and ran without any issue.			"

								I've played a lot of city builder games and generally fail at most of them. I'm really digging this one. The fantasy theme with skeletons, goblins, and wizard's towers is a nice variation. You have to really plan ahead and strategize quite a bit, but when you're successful in doing that it comes together really nicely.  Potentially my new fav city builder.			"

								Great game, city builder with other nations in the world to constantly harrass you for items and gold until you're finally fed up with it and murder them, or die trying.....a lot. I died a lot. It was fun, but I died. And died. And died. I've got an unstopable town with a good army now, but before that I died a lot lol. Among all the deaths, it was still a lot of fun, the deaths were a series of lessons, like don't attack those goblin huts thinking there are only harmless goblin theives in there. There's much more.			"

								After Caesar and Pharaoh, I've been looking for nice city building games for years.  Hearthlands is one of my favorite.  I've played Lethis and Banished.  Lethis is kind of boring and without battle.  Banished is difficult in the beginning but it turns to be non challenging later on.			"

								Time for another update!I'm still playing the hell out of this game and the devs are still updating content and tweeking, including adding more buildings to the game and messing with the AI.  One major change I'm not so sure I enjoy is that invasions are now handled off screen and via popup notice.  Before this update invasions where a real challenge and to survive on easy setting you still had to prepare defense structures and have at least 3 armies pretty early in the game.  This beat me down a ton but I learned as I lost and adjusted accordingly.  Now the invasions seem totally pointless as I never lose them and suffer no consequences for the battle, a battle it should be noted again that I never get to see.Also of note is that getting a notification every time a new trade route opens or a current one ends does not serve me much in terms of usage.  At least compared to how frequently they occur.  I check trade routes regularly as is and don't need to be remind.  However, it would be really nice to be able to jump to the spot on the map where my citizens are being killed!  Nearly every game I have played has put me in the spot of scowering the map over and over trying to find where a citizen or merchant has been killed.  It can be something as silly as a sewer monster hiding behind a build (and hard to see even with the transparent building setting on) and completely ruining my towns reputation.Population growth is still off balance imho.  It seems that my town rep never becomes positive no matter what I do.  Have a walled in, protected town with a booming economy and no enemies on the map?  Still terrible rating.  It either is a flaw in the game or I'm too dumb to figure out something right in front of me.As usualy my complaints sound ungrateful considering how much I absolutley adore this game.  It truly is a hidden gem of the citing building genre and I can't stop playing it for too long.  I hope the end game content sharpens up as the devs continue to tweek.TRIPLE UPDATE:  Not even at V1.0 and this is one of my favorite games of all time.  80 hours in and I finally have a grip on the very easy setting game.  It's kinda awesome figuring a game out with nary a wiki available, at least not in English.  I can't wait to see what the devs add next (will Magic be useful?  Zoom function?  Better pathfinding for military units?).  This is the city building/resource management game I've been waiting for since forever.  Thanks!DOUBLE UPDATE:  I love this game.  Don't buy it.  You'll never want to stop playing.UPDATE:  I think I love this game, I'm sure I'm terrible at it and I know I'll lose many many more hours into it.  HOW DO I EVEN SUSTAIN?I've put in almost 5 hours since I bought this game the other night, so I really really like it.  However, I'm having a terrible time keeping everything straight.  This is probably my own shortcomings, but when I go to make military units I'm never sure if I have enough leather and feather (ha!) going to my industry buildings instead of food.  I would love, LOVE a zoom in/out attached to the mouse wheel.  Being able to get a bird's eye view of the developing city would help a ton as it gets bigger and bigger.As is, the placement mechanizm is great, the art work charming and it's basically a deeper, less combat and mission reliant verison of Majesty.  Which is pretty damn awesome.  TL;DRYou need military units or everyone dies.10/10 will fail more over and over.			"

								This game is easily an 8/10 right now. Possibly a 10/10 when they get the promised stuff they'll implement.Oh and to those who bought this as their first city-builder, it's a good pick; but build storage units, lots of them.worth the money.			"

								tl;dr Verdict: Buy if you're a fan of city builders or wait for a sale and then buy. It's a good game.Hearthlands takes a lot of inspiration from the city-building games in the vein of The Settlers, The Nations, Knights & Merchants and especially the Caesar/Pharaoh/Poseidon series.Despite being in early access, all the systems and 'foundational blocks' of a city building game are there: an economy chain, military units, city planning, rival states, and various 'creatures' that pose a threat to your city in the map. In this regard, I like to think of the game as Caesar 3's city building meets Seven Kingdom's military/combat style (with magic spells to boot). It's definitely worth the money if you're a fan of city building games, but you may want to wait a little if you're not a die-hard fan; the game can feel a wee bit barebones in some aspects such as diplomacy. Still, it's a good title.			"

								If you liked the old Pharaoh/Emperor/Caesar games, you will enjoy this. Just make sure to tweak the game settings to your liking. I wiped a couple of times by going in too hard before getting the hang of it. The economy can get clogged if you don't watch out what you're doing and then it all goes to hell. But it's a good game and worth the buy.			"
