												So happy this game is finally released on Steam! I adored the first one ""Stair dismount"" and this one is even better than the first one being with cars! I do love fast cars and all that, and this game is perfect for having fun and laughing when you see all the accidents. You can also costumize your character being able to place a face of someone you hate and you can also add any car logo you want, like i chose Bugatti :D. Love this game and i'm looking forward to new updates! Have fun playing it yourselves!			"

												+ Lots of fun crashing into objects+ Multiple vehicles with different physics+ Customization options+ Replay value+/- No campaign or story, it's just a bunch of levels (not really needed but still a point I wanted to address)- No goals/objectives, just high scores- You can't put objects anywhere you want, but only on specific spots- Limited number of levels[Rating: 76/100]			"

												This game is INSANE amounts of hilarity! Think of it as a 3D Happy Wheels, except without the overabundance of effortless, repetitive user-made levels.

												What does Turbo Dismount have to offer as a game? Spills, thrills, and mega destruction! This is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and its simple, mindless fun. There is no goal to Turbo Dismount, you kinda just set up a level and watch the carnage. With many customizable options, you can choose how Mr.Dismount explodes or gets beheaded... IN STYLE! If you have a very specific kind of humor and wouldn't find a lifeless body being torn apart and vehicles being ripped apart entertaining (there is no blood in this game as a side note), then this game isn't for you. If you are thinking about buying it and it looks like your cup of tea, go for it! If your looking for a story or an adventure, look elsewhere, because this is the epitome of stupid fun!			"

												Ah, Tubo Dismount.  The name alone conjures up images of, well, your mom, actually, but this is not the time or the place for that particular tale.Anyway, Turbo Dismount is the heartbreaking story of Joe Dismount.  A man trapped in a world that seems to want nothing more than to push him down each time he tries to rise, and hobble him every time he tries to walk.  It's a familiar scene, the cycle of repression which seems torn straight from today's geopolitical headlines.As painful as it is to watch Joe's agonizing struggles, and I must admit it brought a tear to my eye more than once, we have to face the fact that Joe is not entirely a blameless victim here.  Joe appears to be actively seeking his own demise, and every time we see him dangling from the back of a speeding sports car, or rolling off of a cliff in an office chair, we can only wonder what horrors Joe has seen, or dare I say, even participated in, that drive this insatiable lust for the sweet release of death.We may never know, for as simple as Turbo Dismount may appear on the surface, beneath lies a complex web of tortured emotion and dark secrets best left undisturbed.  Some may view Joe as a hero, others may see him as a villan, but where Turbo Dismount succeeds in uniting us, is that we can all see Joe torn into little pieces strewn across a highway in the middle of a twenty vehicle pileup.  I suppose that in the end, that's all that really matters.			"

												Watching a ragdoll with Kanye West's head ride on a motorbike into a pile of bricks is probably the most fun I will ever have in a video game. I've nearly played a whole day of just sending these men in monster trucks into high-speed traffic, and then observing their limbs torn away from their body in slow motion. This is Turbo Dismount.Turbo Dismount is one of these few arcade games that I don't get bored with after about an hour or so. Normally I would play this game for a bit, but then get tired of seeing the same thing over and over. But the vast variety in Turbo Dismount is hands down the best thing about this $10 gem.Customization in Turbo Dismount is everywhere. You could paste your logo onto the front of a sports car, while Mr. Dismount clings on to the spoiler for dear life as he is shot up ramp leading to space, or make him lie down on a skateboard and push him off a cliff. There are around twenty vehicles in the game, but this number will grow with frequent updates. These vehicles include the super fast ""Wedge"", to the strange shopping cart, the ""Mall Racer"". All of which have unique speed and maneuverability.Levels in Turbo Dismount are what make the game shine. The sheer amount of variation with obstacles and level design is what sets Turbo Dismount apart. One of my personal favourites, ""Freeway"" has you atop a broken bridge, where poor Mr. Dismount is flung off and plummets onto a busy freeway, meeting his demise below a wreckage of cars. One other amazing thing about Turbo Dismount is the replay system. This allows you to pause, reverse or fast-forward your current dismount. You are able to see what caused the crash, viewing it at up to 1/16x slower or 4x faster.Another huge plus is the Steam Workshop. Using Unity, a video game development program, and the free Turbo Dismount package, you can create levels for Turbo Dismount and upload them to Steam. I myself have sometimes made strange and crazy paths of destruction, using Turbo Pads and traffic to my advantage. There is also optional Controller Support, which I found quite confusing while using my Xbox One controller.Overall Turbo Dismount is definitely worth the money, and with ample achievements, customization and leaderboards, there is enough content to keep you playing for a lot longer that you though you might have. Turbo Dismount is definitely one of those must-have games, and one that won't be leaving my Installed list any time soon.9.8/10			"

												I absolutely love this game. At first your there like, ""there is hardly any levels, what is the point of playing this game if there ike downloading some more maps."" You go to the amazing steam workshop and doownload some maps. Then you try em out for about three or more hours. You're there like,"" I like these maps I am going to download some more maps."" then you download like fifteen more maps, and after about ten more hours of playing and steam workshop, you have like over one hundred fifty-three maps and you are extremely addicted to the game and can't stop playing. That's basically my perspective of this awesome game, I hope you like it as well.			"

												A very fun dismount game. All you need to do is to kill Mr Dismount and others then getting high scores like around 10 to 30,000,000 and more. The workshop levels are great also, with famous players like Markiplier, Jacksepticeye playing with those. Some workshop levels are very funny when like a mystery boost pad where you explode into pieces. Even some levels can help get you achievements also. Its my first ever crash game on Steam. If you love crashin', you better buy this game!			"

												I had never heard of this game in my life until I saw someone on Youtube playing it.   Then I saw it on steam, then it ended up in my possession.Turbo Dismount is a simple physics sandbox in where your character clings in humorous and non-safe ways onto vehicals and ploughs into traffic.  Really simple.  The crashes and the ammount of damage is a wonder to behold as you see Mr. (Or Mrs.) Dismount roll under cars and loose limbs and break bones.  The Game also has a replay function where you can slow, rewind and fast foward time so you can see that perfect bone crunching angle.  Also you can dot your path to traffic with Turbo Pads, or Speed Bumps, or Half-pipes or mines for the extra 'umph'.Levels are rather small but they do their job, and you have quite a selection of vehicals and poses, and when you are bored of what the developers made there is a host of steam workshop levels for you to play with aswell.And one level of praise I will give the developers, is customization, you can plaster your face, or someone you like (Or really hate) to the puppet Mr (Or Mrs.) Dismount, and you can attach a logo to your vehicals aswell.It's simple, it's fun, it's cheap, you should own this.

												Turbo Dismount is a game where the little guy falls out of the car and then the car runs him over. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy pedals his tricycle off of a cliff and down five stories onto landmines which launch him up into the air. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy does a loop-de-loop on a section of road and drives straight into a patch of landmines at top speed, making him and his car explode rather spectacularly. Turbo Dismount is where a guy gets into a drag race and finishes it by plowing his car into a wall.I could tell you about a hundred of these stories, but it's basically a guy, a car, and a set of circumstances in which you have to figure out how to inflict maximum pain on the guy, and the punchline involves grevious bodily harm.It's a joke you can re-experience and re-tool over and over, but the punchline itself starts to get stale around four hours after you've played out all the variations of ""What happens when an (adjective) (character) in a (type of car) drives into a (insert hazard here)?"". It's a bit like Mad Libs, but with physics and objects.I don't see myself playing this again anytime soon, but the time I did spend with it was hilarious, and there's a level based off of the Springfield Gorge scene from an early Simpsons episode called ""Bart The Daredevil"". So there's your recommendation.			"

												I have played the prequel to this game. Stair Dismount for mobile devices. It was one of the best time-wasters I had ever played, and Turbo Dismount, the sequel that I never even fathomed would be made, is even better than the prequel. You have a selection of quite a few different vehicles, from a monster truck to a skateboard to a red Angry Bird to a fire truck and everything in between. You also have different poses to choose from specific to each vehicle. You choose the map, speed, and GET ♥♥♥♥ING WRECKED by whatever you run into. It could be traffic, a brick wall, landmines, or scenery. It's so fun to see your little dude get mauled by everything in sight. That sounds messed up and quite gruesome, but there is no blood or gore in the game, however, there IS dismemberment, and I'm pretty sure that someone in the future will find a way to make a bloody mod for the game. The physics are well-done in some parts and downright hilarious in others, like when you run into traffic, and then there's a pileup and cars go flying everywhere. If there is one questionable thing I have to say about physics, it's how the guy, if he gets flung into the air, he will slowly stop spinning while in the air. This defies physics and just bugs me a bit for some reason I don't understand. There are also modded levels you can make for the game, which gives the fans something to do to contribute to the game. All in all, this is a time-waster worth the money. It's fun and hilarious and the modding community is very creative. Final Score: 8.75/10.			"

												I first played the Dismount series on mobile years ago and it became one of my favorite time killers to watch these poor rag dolls fall and tumble to their demise. It was one of the few games that I actually wanted to buy the expansion packs for, which added immense enjoyment with the expanded options. When I saw Turbo Dismount on sale on Steam, I knew that It would be hours of stupid amusement. The real fun came when I was hanging out with friends and we had nothing to do and the idea just came to me - ""What would I do if I was bored and didn't know what to do?"" The Answer: Play a mobile game and watch ragdoll physics. So I put my laptop up on the big screen and hours of stupid, fun, enjoyment commenced as we tested new ways to ruin Mr. Dismount's day.			"

Very youtubey game (5NaF, anyone?) but its pretty fun if you like causing carnage.So, it isn't meant to be a very serious game, that’s get that out of the way. If you like watching things explode in a cartoony fashion, this game is for you. Reminiscent of classical flash games, it is very much a game that unless you're making videos with it, it won't take you too long to get bored, that being said, it is a fun game to mess around with until you do.

												I'm sure that many of those interested in buying this game were convinced to do so after watching a number of YouTube personalities ♥♥♥♥ themselves laughing. I was the same way at one point. Take my advice: just watch those videos some more. They're way more fun than the actual game.The objective of Turbo Dismount is to orchestrate vehicular accidents that cause as much damage as possible to your vehicle and the hapless mannequin forced into this dilemma. You have at your disposal various maps, vehicles, obstacles to litter the course with, and poses for your mannequin. If you've seen any of the aforementioned YouTube videos, you're no doubt aware of the sort of destruction that can ensue. This would be all fine and dandy if it actually felt like the player had any real control over the outcomes of these crashes.Accelerating the vehicle consists of holding down a button and releasing it at the moment when a meter is at the desired level. Because of how obscenely quickly the meter fills up and then empties again, precise timing is nearly impossible. This is compunded by the vehicles' tendency to do whatever they want to, such as letting up on the gas when you want them to speed up, vice versa. Many of the obstacles frequently fail to produce an intended effect, and sometimes fail to produce any effect at all. Even in levels that involve other traffic, those other vehicles appear in random order and speed by so quickly that it's nigh impossible to properly time a collision.The physics engine is capable, but unpredictable. A satisfying crash can have vehicle and body parts being strewn about and colliding with each other in amusing ways, but these moments are scarce thanks to the physics' refusal to behave consistently. It's also frustrating how your ragdolling mannequin often struggles to maintain its pose, or even stay attached to the vehicle, in order to have it hit something in a desired manner.All of these frustrations combine to form an experience that is usually comprised of restarting a level over and over and over again to get a desired result. When a beautiful catastrophe does happen, it tends to feel less like the results of the player's planning and effort, and more like the result of unintentional happenstance. Even if the player learns the mechanics and nuances well enough to consistently create satisfying crashes, what's left at that point is just a shallow, one-note time waster. Ragdoll crashes car. Ragdoll goes ragdolling. Oh, how the lolz are killing me.Turbo Dismount is a one-trick pony that ♥♥♥♥s up its one trick nine times out of ten. It may be worth getting if you have some easily amused eight-year-old children in your home who are in need of a distraction. Maybe you're into the sort of boring Sunday afternoon that's reminiscent of tossing about Legos in a feeble effort to create imaginary explosions. Otherwise, don't bother.			"

												The premise of this game is kinda dumb and I wasn't so sure about it. However, it became side-splitting fun very quickly.  Say what you will about any game but if it can literally make me laugh out loud them I'm going to like it. Games like Deadpool, for example, have this same quality.  Basically what you're doing is setting up one of your two customizable characters in a sandbox track type environment for various ways to do serious bodily harm to them.  Its basically like when you were a little kid and would set up a toy soldier on a little obstacle course with cars, explosions, and all of that sort of thing except it is virtual and freeking hilarious.  I've also heard this called a crash test dummy sim and I suppose that is fair too.  All I know is I think other people with a childish sense of humor like mine who like games will probably enjoy Turbo Dismount.  The gamer chooses a course, sets up some obstacles, picks a mode of transportation (cars, bikes, skateboard, etc) a customizable Mr or Ms Dismount character, and the position on the vehicle for the character, then sends them on the way to certain death.  Once the dismount is achieved the whole scenario can be rewound and played back at various speeds to your liking either for your own entertainment or to help decide how to tweak the course.  Everything in the game seems well done.  I haven't encountered anything to complain about.  The graphics are simple but highly adequate and the camera system is great.  If I had to complain about any one thing is that I'd like to see more obstacles and perhaps a user picked starting point.  Its not a big deal and perhaps is something left for the next version.  I'm not much of a multi-player type of person for the most part but I can see where this would be fun to play with someone else.			"

												One of the best stress relievers on Steam.Turbo Dismount is the game you unleash your pent up anger caused by other games (or life) via physics, ragdolls and high speed collisions. It offers a variety of maps, vehicles, character customizations and level customizations as well as several achievements to smash into along the way. The workshop is alive and added to regularly with several well-made and/or funny user created levels for additional gameplay content.  There’s something about those breaking bones and limbs being severed that brings a simile to ones face... Overall, it’s a definite recommendation for physics lovers or those who want a good laugh.

												I'll be honest, this game doesn't really have much of a point, there's not really an objective other than getting as brutally damaged as possible, but that is pretty much it.There are some modded levels that are start-to-end style, but they don't give you that sense of accomplishment.Give this game a try, but it's not a very satisfactory game.

												INTRODUCTIONTurbo dismount is a game I've put a lot of time into. The graphics are great, the possibilities are nearly infinite, and the workshop has thousands of levels. If you want to get the game, yet you are still slightly skeptical, here's my review on Turbo Dismount.STORYOh, story. Yeah, this game has none! The most a completionist can do is play all the pre-made levels and get all the achievements, which will still take around 20-30 hours. The point of Turbo dismount is to mess around with what you got. I've (so far) put around 27 hours into the game and I still can't get enough of the game.FEATURESThe game comes with some levels to mess around in, but you can always download levels from the steam workshop if you get tired of those levels. You can choose several vehicles, which are all unique in their own way. There's a Tricycle, Fire truck, Wrecking ball, Skateboard, Sports car, etc. If you are wondering, you can choose different characters that can pose and be customized. One of my friends had fun putting the face of Donald Trump on his character, then he would do whatever he wanted to. For poses, there's tons of them, exclusive to each character. Yes, you can do a Miley Cyrus pose on the wrecking ball, and you can do poses on the Wastelander (Inspired by the Mad Max films) that are related to the movies. There's also obstacles you can place down such as a speed boost pad and ramps.GAMEPLAYAfter choosing your character, vehicle, pose, and obstacles, you have to hold down [SPACE BAR] to adjust speed. It's a frustrating task because if you release it at the wrong time, you can go really slow, or way to fast for you to comprehend.  I can still use turbo pads to go fast though, because I usually want to go fast. Characters can have their bones broken, dismembered, twisted the opposite direction, etc, and makes the game more interesting. The physics engine is not realistic though. Once I was using a skateboard and my head got blown off from a wooden paddle when I was only going around a smooth 20 mph ( around 32 kph for foreigners).AUDIOThe SFX is clear and more realistic than the physics engine. The sounds bones crushing and muscles tearing is what gets me. I probably wouldn't have laughed at this game if SFX and the music weren't there. The music is a jazzy rhythm, and makes the game seem like an overly-edited fail compalation that you can control.PLAYABILITYThe game has barely any glitches, and recieves laughs from anybody who watches it or plays it. It has the perfect blend of humor and control of paths that I like. This is a must play when my friends come over, and we end up putting 1 or 2 hours of into it everytime. We can laugh at the insanity that happens before our eyes when our character gets blown up by a mine and afterwords mauled by a snow plow. If your mind is thinking ""Why would you laugh at that, ONLY SADISTIC MINDFREAKS WOULD LAUGH AT THAT!"", well I have a claim. Your so called ""character"" is a test dummy, and the game is only a simulation. Also you would be calling Jacksepticeye, Markiplier, Pewdiepie, Kwebblelkop, Ssunde, Ihascupquake, and DanTDM sadistic mindfreaks ( If you don't know who they are, look them up on a trusty site I call Youtube).SUM UP:DO I RECCOMEND THIS GAME?I reccomend this game to a certain crowd. If you are easlily offended, than no. Despite a couple cons, it's definitely the most fun I've had destroyng stuff on my PC (Just Cause 3 is on my XBOX One, so I'm specifying to PC), and is no doubt, a ""kinetic tragedy""(that's the games slogan)My rating? 8.25 out of 10. You can play it with friends, family, yourself, and can see what sort of crazy things the community has done because I forgot to mention that you can upload gifsBy, InfernoLizard64			"

Early Access Review
								This game is smaller than Stair Dismount but costs more money. If it comes out with free or really cheap DLC, you should probably only buy it if it goes on sale, like I did. But, for the levels, vehicles, and characters they have along with the free ones you can download or make yourself, it's not a bad game. I played through each level many times before getting bored just to come back in a week and do it again to try and top my own scores. So what if it seems narcistic to torture, maime and kill a dude to see how high of a score you can get by doing so. Let's all agree it's just fun to see a crash test dummy bite that dust. I give this game a 8/10 for lack of plot, lack of levels, and its price. Not too bad for a good game, go get it!			"

												I have played Stairs dismount and Truck Dismount for years and I liked them very much. I saw this and I thought for such a little price I could not lose. I chose well. This is an exellent game. This is a game I feel that Michelle Obama would like this game because it does not have any fat children in it.EDIT: Now for a real review of the game since it has now gone beta. If you liked the first two games you will enjoy this one very much. There are many levels to play and objects to place for the wide assortment of vehicles to crash into. Good old Mr. Dismount is back and you can smash and dismember him to your hearts content. There is a Workshop with many excellent user -made levels and a level editor (you download the components seperately). The leaderboards are fun to pursue and the community seems quite decent. Updates come fairly regularly and they usually include some new item like a new level or vehicle or obstacle. Also, you can customize your character with a face or bobblehead of your choice and make a custom logo for the vehicles. The game is tight, the physics can be a real riot sometimes but all in all it just adds to the game. I have never had a game crash or any other issues with it, though MacIntosh users seem to have the most problems so take that for what it is worth. The Devs even respond on the board quitye often so for $9.00 USD  (as of this writing) you are getting your value and then some.			"

												Turbo Dismount is awesome. I honestly thought I was gonna play it for maybe 20 minutes and then never play it again (it was on sale for a very cheap price), but it's just too fun. It features many different levels that come pre-installed with the game, a wide selection of vehicles, and the ability to see a crash dummy ride a bicycle into oncoming traffic and causing the biggest car crash you've ever seen. One of the best parts about this game is the large amount of content that you can get from the Steam Workshop. Seriously, A BUNCH of levels for you to try out and crash in. If you're looking for a game that doesn't suck, get this.One more thing...the replay value (which I have seen in other reviews). There is so much replay value in this game.			"

												Turbo Dismount is a really cool game! This combines some of my favorite things in video games: crashes, explosions, complete character humiliation, derp moments, interesting maps, and instant replays (mainly the instant replays). You can play for the points, or even for the fun of it. You can create the perfect recipie for success, or fail and laugh yo head off. Either one is fine. So if you like any of the things I listed above, you will LOVE this game!			"

												So remember in the original ""Flatout"" games? There was like a kind of bonus side game where you could drive your car up ramps and shoot your driver out of the car, aiming him for a giant dartboard in the sky, or use your driver to knock over bowling pins after he crashed through your windsheild.Better yet, remember ""Burnout"" where you got the challenge missions of crashing your car into oncoming traffic, trying to get as many points as you could by causing a pileup?You do remember them?Well this game is those, but with added bells and whistles (you can position your driver on various places on the vehicle for maximum impact or damage, manually drive the van or tell it head off in a preset direction, stuff like that.) Fun, but I liked Burnout's version better.			"

Dismount.  The games where you play as and with the ragdoll to inflict damage, and ""pain"" upon a realistic enough counterpart of a human body, proablly similar enough to your own.  I think this game started as an online flash player sort of game, Stair dismount maybe it was. Anyway, it got very popular and people started to call out saying they wanted more from the game. I think they implemented mods and new maps and such into it, then, later on, they came out with a new game, which had trucks and walls to smash too. Now obviously this game is what has come of those early versions. It is cool to see! The company, (I'm not sure if they were there all along or if they just picked this up for funding reasons) But they have successfully made a good product here on Steam with it. As you can see for yourself, there is a lot to be doing with this game, all working well. Good little evolved product that I had the pleasure of seeing grow along the years.			"

												In short: It's a fun little game and they're still adding content.

												Is this a good, playable, and enjoyable game? YesHowever, it is not worth the $10 pricetag unless you can easily spare this money. I bought this game on sale for $4, and I feel this is a fair price for the game. Why?With the steam workshop, you will probably get around 5 hours at max on this game, and this is the sole reason the game is not worth the $10 in my opinion. It has a degree of replayability, but you'd eventually get tired of the same track your car follows, the same amount and place of obstacles, and the small maps.The crash physics are mediocre, and if you want an automobile game with great and realistic crash physics along with a decent amount of mods and replayability I'd reccomend beamNG drive. This game's physics are more fictional and cartoony, but this isn't a downside, rather a different concept. To the developers (What I think needs to be improved to make this game worth the full price):- Ability to drive custom paths- Ability to mod custom models, veichles and veichle properties, obstacles, and physics- More detailed and textured models, add aesthetical variety to the different maps- Add the ability to place unlimited obstacles wherever, not constrained to certain spots.- Larger maps not constrained by an invisible box but instead more aesthetical pleasing walls/mountains/ect.Again, the theme and concept of this game isn't bad but indeed ""cartoony"" and unique but it needs more features to lengthen it's replayability and add some elements of sandbox. If you enjoy this type of game it's $4 sale price can be a reasonable buy.			"

												When I played PAIN for the PS3, it was mostly just a fun little time waster that I would play for minutes at a time before I either managed to pull off the stunt that I had been trying, or I realized I had other games that I wanted to make progress on.Turbo Dismount is a lot like that. Unlike PAIN, however, I found Turbo Dismount more entertaining.PAIN had optional objectives that you could complete at any time to unlock a few things here and there, but any sort of objective or unlock system makes screwing around feel kinda weird and almost unenjoyable. You feel like you're not accomplishing anything, and there are things that you might want but you won't get by messing around. PAIN also had an immature sense of humor (using a donut shop to make ♥♥♥♥ jokes? Seriously?) that just turns me away for some reason.Turbo Dismount on the other hand, has no objectives or unlockables. In other kinds of games, this would be a VERY BAD THING. But in a game like this, it works really well for some reason. Choose a level, select a vehicle, and hit the accelerator. And hocus pocus, just like that, you've caused a major traffic pileup (you jerk).Another great part of Turbo Dismount is how smooth the replay system is. The replay system in PAIN is oddly awkward to use for some reason, but Turbo dismount somehow gets it incredibly right by giving you no controls other than playback speed and camera movement.Turbo Dismount also features dismemberment (that is not at all gory, because the characters are pretty much just crash test dummies), which makes everything SO much more satisfying. You'll find out what I mean when you ask yourself ""wait, what happened to his head, and where's one of his arms?"" then you realize that you have no idea when he lost his head/arm, and you don't know where they went. And that all works really well with the replay system, because you can find out what happened to said head/arm.Turbo Dismount is just a fun little game to waste time on.Another thing: this is just a more interesting version of Stair Dismount, which you can grab for your smartphone. But this one is WAY better.			"

												Rev up your engines, ladies and gentlemen. It's time to go play in traffic!Speaking away from the biased side of me that's full of stress and could use a game like this, Turbo Dismount makes up the complete package of a ""no win condition"" yet exciting and eventful game. I honestly could sit at my computer and spend a few more hours thinking about what else I could give to compliment my emotions for what seems to be throwing a body with my own face into a lane of full traffic, but I'm still too busy trying to get away from doing exactly that.10/10 would obliterate my body again.

								This is such a small simple little game, and yet it is probably the most fun thing I have ever played. You pick a track, you pick a car, you pick a general direction you want to go, you rev it up, and you let that sucker go! You can sort of kinda steer a little, but hardly being able to control it is part of the fun. All kinds of carnage can ensue, and best of all you can even slap your face on the ragdoll AND put a logo on the car. How cool is that!? You still don't have Turbo Dismount? Well what are you waiting for!? It's only six bucks and runs fabulously even on not-so-great computers. Get this game now. I guarantee you, you will not regret it.			"

												This game is GREAT fun... for about and an hour and a half. After a while, you realize only a few of the levels can actually cause some really funny crashes (don't get me wrong, funny stuff can happen on any of the levels, but the stuff that actually cracks you up is in a few of the levels.) I'm only recommening this because I know it is in an early stage and much more is soon to be added, and I trust many of the things added will push the game to its full potential. For now, though, it's probably not something you will find yourself completely hooked on but it is good. 7.5/10UPDATE:After 8 months, this review is way overdue for an update. It is now SO much better than I possibly could have imagined. I LOVE IT. With more vehicles, more obstacles, and more features then when I first made this review, this game is now worthy of a 9.5/10.			"

												I played Stair Dismount when it came out a while ago and it was fuel for hours of fun. Then this came out. It's all the fun of lobbing ragdolls off cliffs with the added bonus of vehicles and slow motion replays. You can create more levels for the game using the Unity editor and port them into the game and upload them to the workshop where other people can play them. While the extent of what you can do in the editor is fairly limited right now, it is still in development so you can definitely expect more features to come.Pros: - Great physics engine - Decent variety of vehicles and poses - Ability to replay your dismount slow motion - User created levels on the workshop - Obstacles you can place in the levelCons: - Limits to what you can do in the editor			"

There are various maps, track objects to place, positions, and tricks to accomplish. Hilarity is added when you attached a picture of yourself as a bobble head on the ragdoll.

												I recommend this game to you people because it's the funniest, or second funniest game out there. And this is why i do!1: You can break your charecter so he has nothing left of him only the head2: You can put your face on the charecter and put a logo of your youtube channel or whatever on the vehicle3: You can have your own bobel head which is 3d and also halrious4: The game is funWell that's all the reason's i could grab and we will see you later.

												What I really want is a proper version of Burnout's Crash mode, but this will do. Easily the worst 3d camera in any game since Superman64, and a fairly confusing control scheme at first, but wicked fun once you get past all of that. After all that, I'd still get it again.			"

								This is such a small simple little game, and yet it is probably the most fun thing I have ever played. You pick a track, you pick a car, you pick a general direction you want to go, you rev it up, and you let that sucker go! You can sort of kinda steer a little, but hardly being able to control it is part of the fun. All kinds of carnage can ensue, and best of all you can even slap your face on the ragdoll AND put a logo on the car. How cool is that!? You still don't have Turbo Dismount? Well what are you waiting for!? It's only six bucks and runs fabulously even on not-so-great computers. Get this game now. I guarantee you, you will not regret it.			"

												This is more of a party game to be honest. If you have some friends round, or you're maybe making a YouTube video, this is great fun, however as you'll see by my hours, it can get boring on your own - quite quickly. This is probably down to the fact that there is no in-game level editor, you instead have to install Unity - which is a breeze for some (1% of the world' population) and an absoloute pain in the backside for others. The mechanics are nice however and watching your ""Dismounts"" in slow-mo just feels amazingly satisfying.All in all, I give Turbo Dismount around 6/10.			"

												Fun With Accurate Ragdoll Physics Based Game is Fun for a Stint, but Quickly Becomes Stale.This game is very fun. It makes great recording material, and can even generate a large amount of laughs from a group of friends huddled around the monitor. The customization means that you can smack the face of anyone you dislike on this ragdoll and let him/her fly! However, it can get a bit boring after a couple compiled hours of gameplay, but is a nice pick-up-and-play. Overall, I would reccomend it, but not as a meaty cornerstone in your library.			"

								PROS: Decent game, lots of cars and maps, good for messing around. It has a good soundtrack and keeps track of your scores aswell as a leaderboard. There is also a workshop to get new maps from if you get bored of the old ones. Its always awesome to see a crash test dummy looking thing get blown to peices from crashing into things. It has a neat way of dismounting by holding down the left mouse button and letting go at just the right time to maximize speed.CONS: This game doesn't have alot of pizazze to it. All you do is drive cars around and crash into other cars (but if you like that sort of thing then I guess this is a pro) I have played it for about half an hour and I got bored really fast, weather thats because I felt rushed to try the game or I just didn't like it. For me, its only fun for about 15 minutes at a time, but who knows, you may like it for hours. Sidenote: I would absoloutly LOVE this game if there was at least local multiplayer.

Fun while it lastsTurbo dismount is a interesting game and keeps getting better with each update. With workshop support, you can get enough levels to play this game for a pretty long time. After a while though, the game starts to get repetitive and is not much fun. For the price this is still a great game and worth it.			"

Early Access Review
								For those sadistic people out there (and there are alot of us), this game continues the madcap fun of the popular handheld game Dismount where the opbject of the game is to cause as much physical pain to your friendly test dummy as possible on various scenes.  This version continues that theme, but now instead of just giving your dummy a poke to get him/her moving, now you have various vehicles and poses to make it all the more fun.   If they keep adding more scenes and dummies to collect as they did with the handheld game, this should be just as fun, if not more so.			"

												It's AMAZING!!!!!!!! HOWEVER, I don't like that there isn't a way in the game ITSELF to make levels. In Scribblenauts Unlimited, there is an ""Object Creator"" Where you can design you own object, then post it to the steam workshop. But in this game... No. You have to go through MANY STEPS just to get a LEVEL EDITOR!! It's good, but there's that one problem. "

												This is a pretty fun game. It's a fun, boredom killing game about sending your little crash dummy through obstacles and watching him die. The selection of courses, vehicles, and characters is quite nice, and I like that I don't have to buy anything extra, you really feel like you're getting your money's worth. I'm also a fan of the user-created levels. If you're not sure about this game, wait until it goes on sale. I don't think it's worth the whole ten dollars, but it's a great game. 8/10			"

Early Access Review
								I would recommend this game. Although I feel the price is a bit high, the more content it gets the more it will be worth, and I anticipate the price to equal the content very soon. It is a ragdoll physics game where you aim your cars with your ragdoll inside towards various dangers, some of which you control. You choose some of the obstacles, the speed and the direction, but you CANNOT steer the cars. I was put off by that because I expected to be able to, but I was quite satisfied regardless. The map veriety is excellent already as is the selection of cars and obstacles.Pros: -Good content and veriety. More to come.-Fun and entertaining-good FPS and graphicsCons:-Scoreboard glitches, forget's your score/doesn't count it.-Inability to control the car or person's movements after dismount begins. Advice for developers: I would propose something akin to the ""Burnout"" series method of slightly affecting your player's movements after the crash. Otherwise, keep the new content coming and great job so far!			"

												Twas' a beautiful day and Jimmeh decided he would take his fire engine for a spin. His friend Jimmeeh was driving. Because of the motion of the fire engine, he started pelvically thrusting the building. It looked as if he were to be dancing. Then The thrusting became more vigorous and yet more vigourous. Then the driver of this violated fire engine was  like ""THIS IS MY TRUCK"" and at that exact moment in time his body vigorously soared out like a pidgey being shot at.  And then whilst running through the air his arm vicously decided it would merge with his foot. and his arm was no more.Then came the MINES He was surely of a deceased state at this particular moment in time however Turbo Dismount decided to rub mines in the wounds The mine struck the fatal blow and Jimmeh Sanderson of Glasgow was a pile of some legs (possibly a hand aswell maybe even a neck or a shoulder).

												I watched some let's plays of this game. I thought that it might be pretty fun.And it was.For a short matter of time.The gameplay itself gets really repetitive and boring after short time.It's just watching a ragdoll get crushed and hit by things, all over again.Well, you can occasionally take a screenshot of the said ragdoll making a funny/goofy pose, but that's pretty much it.There's not too much variety of vehicles or maps, at least not right now.Speaking of vehicles, their destruction is pretty simplistic, not much detail, which is just... meh. Yes, I know, it's Turbo Dismount. It has it's own style, but, I just had to type this. In the end, I'm complaining, right?...Now, the maps - If you decide to download some from the workshop, which you will probably do, because the default ones get boring pretty fast, you're just going to find those:-Minefield-Manual driving obstacle course-If you're lucky, maybe something original and pretty alrightAdditional, little complaints:-Touching anything makes you lose control of your vehicle.-No option to choose a default camera.-The PRICE. Come on, €/$10?In conclusion, gets boring really fast and is really repetitive.Actually, what would you expect from a crash test game?...			"

Early Access Review
								When I saw this game hit Steam’s Early Access page today (January 10th, 2014), I knew that I had to reach out to the developer and inquire about a press copy (a big thank you to Jani Kahrama from Secret Exit Ltd. for accommodating).  I am a big fan of games that feature realistic physics and so far, “Turbo Dismount” isn’t disappointing.  Just to give you a bit of perspective, “Turbo Dismount” was inspired by “Stair Dismount”, a personal impact simulator, released back in 2002.  In “Turbo Dismount”, you’ll be doing your darndest to cause bodily harm to Mr. Dismount in order to maximize the number of points you receive.  To add insult to injury, you can crop photos of your friends’ faces onto Mr. Dismount…there’s no better “thinking of you” card out on the market.  For obvious reasons, this game assumes that you have a sense of humor…if you don’t, you may not want to read any further.As noted above, the game is still in development so a review is not ethically possible at this point.  Still, the game is pretty fun, even in its current state.

												This is a simple but very fun game. You can change the levels a little bit and play with multiple vehicles. True the levels that come with the game are limited but thankfully this game has workshop, so people can create new levels. I'm enjoying the game so much that I subscribed to every single level in the workshop (almost 300). Looking forward to the new updates and I really hope they add more achievements. It's really fun trying to accomplish them. Money well spent. It is worth it.			"

												If I had a dollar for every limb my character lost in this game, I could probably buy the developer of this game. Seriously, this game is hilariously fun. There's no set goal or anything. Much like its predecessor Stair Dismount, the goal is to inflict as much damage to yourself as possible to rack up points (more points if you lose limbs or total your vehicle).

												I'd really hate to put a damper on this game but it's sadly one of those games that's a novelty more than it is an actual game, It's more fun to watch than it is to play.It's really dull, you just rev up the car, pick a pose, let it rip and watch the guy go flyling. You get a small laugh out of it but afterwards it's just really dumb.If you watched it on youtube and watched it until you can't laugh anymore, this game won't be any good to you. It's value can easily be ruined, even by watching it.If you still want to play the game anyway, by all means go ahead. It's stupidly funny but it's just easily boring in minutes and if you watched it already, you might as well not buy it.			"

								BEST GAME EVERY!!! An amazing crash-simulator game! I was so excited for this game to come out on steam and it has MUCH more features than the demos. I voted for it on greenlight hoping it would get on and it did! This game is epic and has very realistic physics too!!! :)			"

												Not at all a deep game, and you don't actually get to drive any of the vehicles. So, it's not really anything like HappyWheels, which is a disappointment. The meat of the game is picking obstacles to put on the map, pick a vehicle, and determine how fast it will go on it's imaginary rail. So, from an interaction standpoint, it's actually a bit dull.But the reason I've put a few hours into this is that the physics engine is really good (aside from the cars that make up CPU traffic weighing about 5kg's each), and the rag-doll mechanic is consistently funny in at least a minor way. Plus, it's what I'd call a 60-second game: you can play it in the few minutes extra you have between being ready for work and actually having to leave. Really, it's a good way to get a chuckle if you are running ahead of your schedule and have a few minutes. It's the sort of game you can enjoy without needing more than a minute, unlike many games, and it's cheap enough that the lack of depth isn't a problem.But only if you can get past the lack of interaction. The spectacle is fun, and there's enough options and choices to set-up your crashes and jumps for the vehicles, but my recommendation is only a marginal thumbs-up since there's no actual driving and the spectacle is only going to get you so far. Again, you can't actually drive the vehicles, and the level of interaction is very low besides just choosing a car, speed, maps, and placing a couple obstacles. But it's worth it for a game to have when you just want to have a laugh in the minute or two before having to do something else.(FINAL NOTE: Around 10 of my hours were gained because of forgetting the game was on after I went to bed. As I said before, it's not something you'd expect to put much time into, but the time does add up if you mess around 5 minutes here or there during a work-week or school week. Really, I think I'm at actually a little over a dozen hours).			"

Would I pay 10bucks (70kr) for it? no. But if you can get it at a sale price its well worth the laughs and is one of the few games I know that you can play for 10 minutes or so at a time.			"

												Do you enjoy watching characters in videogames get brutally dismembered but then immediatley feel bad for them becuase of that annoying human trait called empathy? Then this is the thing for you! Set up a vehicle with a crash-test-dummy, set it rolling into an absurdly chaotic situation and watch as both vehicle and dummy explode gloriously! And since the only characters are crash-test-dummies, your empathy can sit back and relax. Okay, serious mode on: There isn't much ""gameplay"" to this ""game"", really, it's more of a stress-relief toy; a brilliantly fun stress-relief toy, but a stress-relief toy nonetheless. Sure, the first time you start it up, you can waste away an hour or two seeing how each vehicle handles each scenario, but beyond that, there's little play value other than for those times when you just want to watch a mannequin's buttocks detatch from it's torso as it crashes into a wall at 80mph. That said, I'd say it's worth the price tag; the game may not have much LIFESPAN per-se, but it does have a lot of entertainment value.			"

												Like running into walls mindlessly and never doing anything else, well this game is for you as it basically destroys your brain cells so you can run into walls and do nothing else!			"

								Just found out about this game and can't stop playing it. I can see it getting boring after a while but steam workshop support helps fix that. 10/10 would bang.			"

								This is an amazing game! You get to just plain destroy things! Although I wish there were fires on the cars, and they would explode. But its only in early acess so.			"
