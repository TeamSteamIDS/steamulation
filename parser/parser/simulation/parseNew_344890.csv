Early Access Review
								Very interesting concept, very weird decision to enable Early Access on such a ""Pre-Alpha"" early stage.A space game with decent simulation and an actual interesting plot which challenges you to break away from its chains? Definitely interesting.In A.R.M. you are a (possible) criminal locked up in a Mining Barge, and mining asteroids with a mech for as long as the system tells you to is your sentence.If you try to misbehave, they come for you. If you try to escape, they come for you.Your mech has upgradable parts, and there's a modular damage system. There's a really cool system by which you use the ARM tool of your mech to pick things, like bombs, wedges or other tools, and you can also activate a jet on the ""hand"" in order to propel whatever you're holding, or use it as a reverse thruster. Never seen that before - very interesting.There's other simulated variables, like heat, oxygen, fuel, energy, battery, and newtonian flight.However, this is all there is to this game at the moment. When I first bought it, you couldn't even play for more than 5 minutes without something breaking. Now it's a little bit better, but all you get is a very little sample of what the game COULD be, with some weird gameflow issues.In my own, personal and honest opinion, releasing a game this early is an horrible idea. There's not even an actual clue to where the game is going - it could become a Sandbox game, or a linear story game with open-world elements. It doesn't seem like the devs have a consensus about it, either.ARM is all concept, no game. I wish all the best for the developers, which seems to be a brand new company. They seem really interested in making something good. And for Early Access games, the developers matter more than the current state of their product.But, again, you can't just release something in this state. It's more of a weird Kickstarter than an Early Access purchase. And as a reviewer writing for fellow gamers, I can't just pretend it's not. "

Early Access Review
								Kinda creepy, claustrphoic and mysterious being locked inside a prison, then being forced to work as a mining slave for a strange and humurous Ai. Kinda reminds of 2001 space movie.Then when I try to escape these Xterminator robots chased after me, warning me to return to the barge.So I disobeyed and tried to attack the barge and they blew me up!The survial and managment of systems is really instersting, the devs did put a lot of work in the amount of things going on under the hood. Can I get to the planets? They seem far away, and the MRRM seems too damn slow...hopefully I can commender the Mining Barge and fly to the planet? How do you escape the jail, I can't find any materials for the lockpick?Hope there are freaky aliens like xenomorphs or somethingThere are lots of bugs, guess because it is early access, although the devs seem active in fixing them. They also seem to care about what the community thinks about the future of how the game goes. I would much prefer it goes dark, and be more of a psychological horror game rather than a Mine Craft clone.Lots of potiental from the indie team, excited to see what they could do once they recieve funding. Let's support them so that we can help them build this game even more, I think they will be in early access for the next year. Can't wait for the final version.			"

Early Access Review
								Note: I'll potentially change this review if can actually get the game to work, but for now I feel like I probably wasted my money.I'm playing this game on the Oculus Rift.  Firstly, the game won't even run from within SteamVR, but fortunately I found a forum post in which the devs suggested running the game exe directly and that worked.  Second, and this is the game-breaking part: no inputs work! The mouse and xbox controller work to move the game cursor around, but that's it. Headtracking is fine, but from the very first instance of needing to select something in the game (menus prior to playing seem to work fine), xbox buttons, mouse buttons, and keyboard keys do nothing. So I'm dead in the water right from the get-go.  I found a post in the forum in which several people indicated having the same problem, but the dev responses weren't helpful and I don't know if those other players resolved their issues.The forum posts from devs seem to go back to early December and then nothing.  I'm not sure if devs abandoned the game, but as of right now, there was only one recent forum post from a player and even that was a week ago.TL;DR: looks like this might be another dead early access game and I'm out 10 bucks on what looks like something promising.  Again, if I hear from a dev to get my current issue resolved so I can actually play the game, I'll at least update this review to reflect that.EDIT: I just found that my post in the game forum regarding the problems I was having with the game (as well as asking where everyone had gone, since the forum appears to be dead) has been deleted! I'd say that's a pretty strong indication to stay far away from this game. My money was stolen but yours doesn't have to be.  The game is unplayable right now (despite many other VR games working fine with my OR rig) and rather than supplying a support response to my post in the forum, they deleted it! What is going on with this game??			"

								The game has some serious graphical glitches at the moment that make it almost unplayable: textures are low res, shaders are broken (the planet is surrounded by a black border which pops through all foreground objects), lighting and shadows are borked.Worst thing is I posted about this two weeks ago and there's been no developer response at all.Its an interesting concept but unfortunately the game doesn't work at the moment.Also, the HUD doesn't look like it does in the first dozen screen shots. Its some really ugly placeholder looking thing.			"

Early Access Review
								As this is early access it is difficult to effectively review it. The core game mechanics are there, the graphics are decent. Contols leave alot to be desired, and the fact that the tutorials hardly work (if at all) just makes it downright uncomfortable giving this game a good review. I feel this one needs more time in the oven. Like alot more time. Not worried so much about the storytelling or the writing, those things can progress natuarally as the game itself is fleshed out. I would recommend this game, but only after at the very least it gets a proper tutorial. The game already has alot of depth, there is already alot of content, alot of things you can do..... But now the game just needs to be able to teach you how to do it. It is my hope that the devs continue to support this game, as there is really nothing else in its class.			"

Early Access Review
								The screenshots and videos are not what I got (Brand new top of the line laptop, unless steam was not updating to newest version somehow)I started playing the game, thought nothing of it, but was having an issue with mining things so I went looking for help.  I went to the store page by accident and noticed the pictures do not match up with the ones in the game in the slightest.  You start in a pitch black room with stuff all over the place that you can not see, as you'll notice the pictures feature a brightly lite room.  You enter your mining craft and the interface is again completely different, very basic, the mining does not work particularly well, my drill and laser would hit the surface of asteroids, make noise, then stop making noise and nothing came from it but an empty battery.  Unless something was seriously wrong with my download/my steam was not updated despite multiple relauches and integrity tests, the pictures and videos are outright lying.			"

								Not ready for prime time.No save game, controls are awkward and feedback is unclear and strange.I've tried to play the game numerous times, but despite manipulating everything I can't seem to refuel and then my ship spontaneously gets damaged despite not moving anywhere.  Maybe that is user error but it's totally baffling to me.No, I don't want to have to read some how-to outside of the game, either.  If the game doesn't present itself, them it doesn't.			"

Early Access Review
								Positive recommendation as far as EArly Access games go. It is playable and has an interesting premise. The features currently implemented are more of a proof of concept teaser trailer. They introduce novel game dynamics that once fully built out, should make for an interesting game. But as they stand they are sufficiently buggy to prevent extended gameplay.In its current state at the time of this writing, the game has numerous bugs that, at least for me, freeze the game up constantly, requiring a restart of both the application if not the entire save game.  Buy it to get the sneak peek and support the dev. Don't buy it if you are looking for a game with hours of playability. At least for me on my system, it is little more than a brief demo before crashing. But as a demo, it demonstrates exciting possibilities.  Good job devs, looking forward to when you find an investor, quit your jobs, and stop nibbling at this game's development part time.			"

Early Access Review
								It's Good, although there's not too much to do at this time in the early access, it seems like you can fly around a mining barge in a mech suit, and mine rock and ice asteroids. The learning curve is kinda difficult, the tutorial only showed once an then didn't go back on...Although once I got the hang of the controls, it was fun and intuitive. Seems like there is lots of depth and details, just there is lots of bugs, I was able to escape the jail and fall through the barge. There is also a mesh missing when I landed on the landing pad. There should be more asteroids, it would be nice to have an asteroid belt with many more sizes, and some mixed with both rocks and ice.When I bought the Hava for 300CR, nothing seemed to happen, how do I get the parts and materials for Ferris to craft new tools? Also the player should be able to recover lost cargo once they die, losing all my cargo was frustrating. The characters look really shiny and smooth, almost like plastic. Overall, pretty cool and interesting game, I would recommend it, even though it's early access, because we can still help the developer find bugs and make suggestions on how the game will turn out.

								Interesting concept with a lot of potential for improvement. In this mining space simulator your one and only goal is to escape the prison. You are locked in the cage and forced to work for mining company by mining different types of asteroids and what not. If you dont obey they will come for you, if you try to escape they will find you. Looking forward for more to be added. Tutorial is very useful.			"

The story and setting is also very intriguing and am looking forward to seeing more depth evolve over time.			"

Early Access Review
								ARM is, even though it's early Alpha stage, already delivering a space walking experience that I have found missing in other games of the genre. At this point the game focuses on mining, and does it quite well at that. Mining shouldn't be easy and managing battery power, oxygen, fuel and heat while simultaneously trying to catch chunks of ore is ...challenging - in a good way! Also worth mentioning are occasional debris fields hurtling through your area at dsiturbing speeds, giving you great opportunity to experience the detailed damage model and repair (EVA) system!Pros:Unique mining experience.Captures the gloomy, lonely and exposed feeling of spacewalks well (compared to other games, at least).Lots of controls available inside the MRM (the tub you're stuck mining in atm)Basic ontrols are easy to grasp.Advanced controls are available (full newtonian & subsystem controls).Great potential!Active and attentive developers.Ingame tutorial (could be improved though.)Cons:Unstable (had five CTDs during the first two hours of play).Limited content (Alpha - duh).Manual is outdated and there is a distinct lack of ""how-tos"".Tutorial repeats every time you enter the level.In short: If you enjoy realistic, gritty space sims, keep an eye on the beauty! Well worth the price at this point!			"

								Do you like watching the sun rise and thinking, today has possibilities?Do you like putting cash down on the table when gambling, because you might win, and if you don't at least you had a fun game of cards?Do you like when someone tells you ""have you heard"" not looking horribly stupid and silly and saying ""no"" but instead saying ""been there mined that this is what your doing wrong son.""Do you space?Do you like mining?Do you like the idea of being a prisoner of boath and trying to escape build your escape with nothing but your wits and what you can beg borrow or steal?Do you like an original concept that's not just, man with gun does pew pew, man with sword goes hack slash, or something so avantguard it barely resembles a game?Do you like VR games that have a story, and gameplay that's more than a glorified tech demo costing way more and providing way less than a look around version of clicker heros?Well this game is early alpha, putting money down is investing in it's future. If you like the idea then back it. This is TRUE alpha. It's not triple A, it's not beta, it's truly a work in progress, and where and when it works it's great. It can crash randomly. It can look like crap at times.  If you like riding the bleeding edge, watching a project grow, and knowing you were the first one in your circle of friends to see it, and support it, and maybe even give some feedback that helped to shape it, then this is a great game for you. If your like me take the plunge.. if not don't, or save your dimes and buy it when the cool kids tell you to and it's fully developed.			"

								I cannot recommend this game at this time.  First off, kinda lacking in direction from the start.  It lacks an area to ease into learning everything.  For the life of me I dont know how to get my drill to work again for example.  Bland gameplay, at this time, makes me feel as though I am a prisoner within the game being punished for playing the game.  Maybe in a few updates and more content I might revisit and update my opinion of the game.  Finally, the game lacks any real thing to do other mine rocks.But, what they do have right is the physics and feel of working in space, which I like.  It doesnt feel to ""arcade""-y.I hope to see better things from this game, but seeing as it is now 2017 and the state of the game I have serious doubts for this game.			"

								Space games nowadays are far and few, so when I first heard about this I was very excited.Considering it is an extremely early access game (just released for early access not to long ago) it looks incredibly promising. The developers are very active on the discussion forum, and are quick to help fellow prospectors, and so far have been releasing updates at a steady pace for what appears to be a very small development team.The game is in it's baby stages, but I think that's all the more reason to buy it while it's on early access an support the developers. We have what can be an absolutely amazing space sim, but it wont get to be that if we don't support the developers.tl;dr: Extremely promising game with very helpful and active devs. Buy the damn thing already!

								Got this in a bundle pack, I am a big fan of space games; always have been, from Wing Commander to the new survival crafting breed.This... This... Simulator... This is the video game equivilent of that weird 1970's USSR science fiction movie you saw as an 11 year old at 3 a.m. on the Sci Fi channel, which is still causing you existential problems to this day.I have only JUST got into the tutorial, but from this glance, it is clear this is going to be one hell of a ride...The flight mechanics and tool use are wonderful, the free look allows for a VERY robust menu/stats system to be accessed, it's a little over whelming at first, but once you get it, it all makes very good sense.The text is fairly Russianized English; which honestly adds to the atmosphere I find... Graphics are good too, nothing to complain about, game is a bit confusing, but most space games are.			"
