												This is honestly one of the best games I have ever played and I am generally not all that fond of the simulation game genre. The tension and sense of achievement I experienced with it were quite unlike any other game I have played in over 20 years.My most memorable moment came when patrolling in the Atlantic off the Western coast of Ireland. According to German command an Allied shipping convoy was expected to pass through the area. I patrolled the area leisurely for days, constantly checking in with my hydrophone operator for signs of the convoy. After 5 days, he finally called out a contact.I took over the hydrophone myself. He was right. There was the distant sound of screws bearing through the water. I immediately went to consult with my naval charts and try to calculate an approximate course for the convoy and an interception course for my boat. It was nothing more than guesswork facilitated by rulers and sextants. Nevertheless I gave the order for the navigational officer to change course. We had reached the Atlantic uneventfully and still had all of our torpedoes. Anticipation of the hunt crept into my thoughts.We waited for about a day and a half, following the convoy through the hydrophones. Then the watchman at the conning tower reported he had sighted a ship. I went up in the tower with him and grabbed my binoculars. Distant dots littered the horizon. We had found the convoy. There were a little over a dozen ships guarded by two destroyers from the British Navy. It was late in the afternoon. Night and the protective shroud of darkness were still hours away. I decided to follow ahead of them and wait for darkness. I returned to my charts and plotted a new course for the navigator. Then we waited. The convoy grew closer and closer. Eventually, sailing on the surface became too risky a proposition and I ordered a dive, still staying ahead of the convoy. As we continued ahead of our prey, daylight eventually gave way to twilight, which gave way to darkness. The moment to strike had finally come.I ordered every man to battle stations and for the navigator to take the boat off to the right flank of the convoy. The boat was positioned perfectly in the darkness. About 6-700 meters off the closest ship. I ordered the torpedo hatches opened and together with my weapons officer I calculated a firing solution. We were in perfect postition. Our target was a Liberty merchant vessel sailing under the British flag. I fired two torpedoes. They went off towards our target. Due to our proximity we did not have to wait long for the results. Both torpedos scored direct hits and cracked the merchant vessel in two. A fiery explosion briefly turned night into day on the surface. I immediately ordered a dive and submerged beneath the convoy in order to hide the sound of our engines against those of the ships in the convoy and hopefully confound the escorts. It worked.Throughout the night I hounded the convoy, heading up near the surface to sink another ship before going back down again. I heard the sound of depth charges turning water into foam. I sank 5 ships worth nearly 30,000 tons of shipping. By the night's end we had spent all of our torpedoes and I pulled away, reporting the convoy's position and estimated course back to German command so that other u-boats might fall upon it.Dawn arrived along with a feeling of euphoria. I set a course back for port. As I watched the sun rise over the Atlantic, Beethoven's ""Moonlight Sonata"" played from the worn old grammophone in my quarters.We sailed North and East of Great Britain so that we might stay as far away from British patrols and air coverage as possible. Morale on the boat was excellent. Our patrol had lasted nearly 3 weeks. Then, the Watchman spotted another ship on the horizon. It was a distant, lonely dot. Impossible to make out. We had expended all of our torpedoes in the attack on the convoy, yet our deck gun was still fully loaded and able to sink unarmed merchant vessels. Enthusiastic about my earlier victory and eager to add another kill, I ordered the boat to close in on the distant speck. That was a mistake.Even as the ship grew larger in my binoculars, I had trouble making out its shape against the horizon. Then, its identity became all too clear, when I spotted two flashes of light from its deck. Panicked, I ordered an emergency dive but it was already too late. The first shell landed in the water a little way's off the boat and sent a geyser of water cascading into the air. The other shell scored a direct hit on the boat.We dived and I ordered full power to the engines, even as water poured into the boat and started to fill the compartments. The men fought a desperate battle against a tide that seemed to be unending, all the while we descended further and further into the depths... 100 meters... 150 meter... The hull started to creak dangerously. The boat would not pull up. It had taken on too much water. We could not blow the ballast tanks. The destroyer was up there waiting for us...200 meters...I watched the depth gauge, my heart pounding in my chest. The hull creaked loudly. Finally, the chief engineer had managed to seal the leaks in the engine room and pump out impressive amounts of water. There were dead and wounded. Morale, which had been so high only an hour earlier, was now at a low point. The boat was still going down. I looked at the faces of my men. There was no other choice. Come what way. I ordered them to blow the ballast tanks.We surfaced. There was no sign of the British warship that had opened fire on us. I could not believe our luck. I immediately ordered the crew to attend to full repairs and for the navigator to set us back on course for home. With luck and God on our side, we managed to limp back to Germany and safety but not without the harshest of lessons. On the Atlantic Ocean you are only the hunter until you become the prey.			"

												SH3 is one of those games that you need to invest time in. It is a perfect example of a ""Dad game,"" as Yahtzee Crowshaw once put it. It's meticulously detailed, and you must learn all of the different eccentricities of the sub to be a great captain.It uses the real-life technological limitations from WWII to define the gameplay. Want to fire off a torpedo? A standard gas-powered torpedo leaves a trail of bubbles in the water, which ships can detect in advance and will swerve to avoid your torpedo. You can fire an electric torpedo, but you'll need to be close, or else the battery in the torpedo will die and it won't reach your target. SH3 is filled with these sorts of tactical nuances that really make it satisfying to play.Difficulty is customizable. It can be as simple as ""point the periscope at a target and shoot,"" to manually identifying and anaylizing your target's position relative to your own. Difficulty is increased by making the game more akin to real life (limited air, limited fuel, no periscope stablilization, etc.) This helps tremendously, since beginners can relax the difficulty while they familiarize themselves with the ships' systems.The player is awarded more renown following a mission with high difficulty, compared to a mission with a lower difficulty setting. Renown is SH3's version of experience points. It allows you to 'purchase' upgrades for your sub like improved batteries, hydrophones, conning towers, or even a completely different sub altogether. Medals are awarded after each mission, which you can assign to your crew. This is probably the single most satisfying part of the game; the medals allow your crew to function more efficiently, thus improving things like torpedo reload times.There's a lot to cover here, so let me just wrap this this up by saying that this is probably the best simulation game I've ever played. I find myself coming back to it every couple of weeks. It's aged quite horribly, but I don't care, since the gameplay is just too good. Forget the sequels in this series, SH3 is the best.			"

												Are you wondering whether to buy this over Silent Hunter 4 or 5?Although SH5 has had some substantial attention from the modding community, it still has a way to go, so I would hold off on that one.SH4 features US Navy submarine warfare in the Pacific theatre. If that tickles your fancy it is equally as good as SH3.SH3 features German U-boats in the Atlantic theatre in WWII. It has adjustable settings for difficulty, which the game deems ""realism"". These features include whether the game will just automatically lock on to a target and automatically set your torpedoes upon them, or whether you would like to do the calculations yourself. Let me tell you there is a significantly rewarding feeling when doing the calculations yourself, waiting for what seems like an eternity for the impact, not knowing whether the torpedo will hit... then you see it happen. You almost can't believe it. Such a great feeling.This game isn't about instant gratification. There is a lot of planning involved and you will have to figure out how to best intersect with your targets' headings. It is really rewarding though, and I can't say that about a lot of games.As far as mods, I suggest going with Grey Wolves and then heading over to subsim.com to check out what is available.			"

												Silent Hunter III .... a 2005 game but..... Remember what i already tell you before..... Old but gold...SH III is the best of the series..... ! Why ?? I will tell you why.Because Silent Hunter III is very close to whats happen in 39 45 under the water.....Yeah i am a big u-boat fan, i live close to the sea in a place where still WW II Bunker.88 Canon, S Boot base and more.........I collect WW I and WW II insignia, u-boat insignia, badge, eitterkreuz, bayonet bullet....This dont make me a nazist x)Ok back to SH 3, why is this old game realistic ?Easy as that man.You create a new carrier, you select your u-boat type + u boat crew, your torpedo, select your Realism % then you start the game....Your BDU will tell you that you have to patrol 24hoo in AL47 grid for examplebut you can decid to avoid this, and patrolling where the fI_Ick you want.THIS is badass !You want to patrol in Gibraltar ? Go my friend GO ! You want to patrol in Reykjavik ? Go my friend GO !!You want to patrol in Scapa Flow ? Go my friend GO !!!THIS is badass !Silent Hunter 3 is easy as that, you select your period time + u-boat type and your u boat crew.Then you go where you want !And again this is badass !You wont receive any message saying like.Hey you have to go there and destroy this \/essels.NO ! In Silent Hunter 3 YOUR FREE to patrol where you want !Just like in 39 45 period !So what made this game badass ???MOD ! My preferate one is for sure GWX gold + other couple of mod.It can make your game looking like that >>> 


YouTube™ Video: Silent Hunter III - Tempest - 72129 Tons. 

			Views: 328		

			In this video ? Tempest again and again..... Some juicy and big target are going down. A very nice patrol. A pic from the S boot base + one of my u boat badge are shown somewhere in the video.		

Hé héyyy !! Not bad mein Freund !In any Silent Hunter game you can customize everythings, gramophone tracks, texture from your u-boat, vessels, your crew men and way more...But remember... If you are like me... A u-bot fan.....You have to play and stay on Silent Hunter 3.The 4 is okay but definitively not my kind, and Silent Hunter 5 is a big joke....What else ? ....Go for Silent Hunter 3..../-\LAAAAaaarrrrmm !!Ps: AM FRENCH MY ENGLISH IS NOT PERFECT x) ....

												One of the things I demand from any game is that is draws you in & immerses you in the experience it's trying to create.Silent Hunter 3 does that massively. The premiss is simple; take your U-Boat out, reach a pre-determined sector by what ever course you want, patrol it & try to sink any enemy ships you find. Simple, easy to remember.That is, until you get dud torpedoes that cheat you out of that BIG score, a swarm of aircraft just won't leave you alone by swooping down time & again, your crew are all exhausted, an escorting destroyer is determined to depth-charge you back to the stone age, sweeping over you again & again while you desperately try to contain any damage & sneak away to safety...The game allows you to fast-forward the cruising bit, you don't strictly have to return to base once you complete your objectives, you can program each torpedoe manually or let the game manage it, manage & train up your crew, upgrade you sub, go whatever route you want, sink what you want, Silent Hunter 3 really is what ever you want it to be.If all you want is to drool over high resolution textures & realistic faces, go somewhere else, but if you want a fairly unique, utterly immersive & tense gameplay experience, Silent Hunter 3 really is a great game. Highly recommended.			"

												This game reminds me of the movie ""Das Boot"".  It is a remarkable experience to play.You would never dream putting on a pair of headphones and listening for hours on end to white noise while staring at a static screen could be fun.  And the first time doing this I remember thinking ""I really made a big mistake buying this game"".Until... there!  There's a ship out there at such and such a bearing!  Let's go find out what it is!Silent Hunter III goes through the full emotional experience of extreme boredom and painstaking listenning - it's an almost Zen-like meditative state.  All the way to the intensity of hitting that torpedo fire button and knowing all hell is about to break loose.  Watching a ship sink and patrols on their way to take you out.  And then getting a destroyer to unload depth charges and praying your sorry♥♥♥♥♥you'll live through it all.If that isn't enough - there are enemy airplanes out patroling.Recommended.			"

												Some people say that this game is for adults only. Well, I'm 14 years old, and I LOVE it. It's graphics may be dated, but It's a brilliantly detailed game, made by people who care deeply (pun not intended) about the subject. If you want a game that tests you in a unique way... BUY THIS GAME.			"

												Best WW2 Submarine simulator game I ever saw. There is a sequel, however it takes a look at the Pacific Ocean rather than the Atlantic, and the association created by making a game about German submarines in this area immediately sinks us into the movie ""Das Boot"".For 2005, this game has the most depth out of all the other naval simulations that exist, and there aren't too many of them, which is quite a shame.  The game itself, is easy to learn but hard to master, especially when enabling the realism settings, such as dud torpedoes, no external camera view (meaning that you are limited to the periscope which, in terrible weather really gives you a feeling of what it's like to be in endless ocean) etc. etc. It's a game better played with a cup of tea, prepared for hours of searching for enemy ships or convoys, planning an assault and getting away (or maybe returning). It's quite simple.  But the idea - of making ships go to the bottom (that's very well detailed as well) simply grabs my attention irreversibly.  If you're into ships, this game is one you should try. Although it's nearly 10 years old, a marvelous mod called ""The Grey Wolves"" breathes some life into it, while a small but friendly community on www.subsim.com keeps this legendary game alive and sailing. I'd say it's quite sad that we don't get these types of games more often. Also, yes - this is probably better than Silent Hunter V at least without mods (not many of them (up to today - 23/07/2014)).			"

												This is the greatest game in the silent hunter series.  The lack of cutscenes and the seemingly endless supply of mods make for great replay ability.  Also, the system requirements are pretty much nil for a heavily 3D intensive game (Although some of the mods will change this) OH! And I forgot!No additional Ubisoft DRM bull sh!t like in the newer silent hunter editions.			"

												105 miles west of Ireland, your crew spots a British destroyer 8 miles off starboard, you begin to manouvre and give the order to descend to periscope depth. As the watch crew begin to climb back into the U-Boat, it suddenly becomes evident that the destroyer has also seen you, and this is confirmed with a shell that lands no more than 200m astern. The watch officer is the last man still on deck, and just as he starts to decend the ladder a shell lands a direct hit on the conning tower. The watch officer is dead.You set the engines to flank speed and order crash dive. Bells ring out as all men take up action stations and the conning tower is secured as the boat starts to tilt nose first into the depths of the Atlantic. The destroyer has closed distance and unleashes volley after volley towards the U-boat as it slowly starts to descend. More hits, the deck gun is damaged, one of the rear torpedo tubes is destoyed and several pipes burst with seawater flooding into the boat.At a depth of 85m you order dive planes set to 0 degrees and the boat starts to level out. The leaks have been plugged and you have the diesel engines shutdown and a startup of the electric motors and the crew resorts to 'silent running'. Now at just 1/3 speed, the Hydrophone operator whispers that the warship has closed to less than 1000m, then the dreaded ping is heard. Ricocheting through the metalwork is gradually gets faster until it suddenly stops and the whole crew can hear the engines quickly passing overhead.The hydrophone operator whispers that he hears splashes, and immediately you order flank speed and hard to port. Seconds later explosions rock the boat, more water bursts from the seams of pipes and gauges. The lights go out temporarily and the boats is listing to port. Silent running is abandoned and the crew get to work plugging holes and repairing equipment. The pumps are all switched on to try to empty the rapidly flooding compatments of water and the boat continues to descend uncontrollably into the abyss.More depths charges are dropped as the crew wrestles to bring the boat back under control, the depth gauge shows you have dropped to 180m and the limits of the boat are starting to be reached. The whole boat creaks and groans as the pressure builds up outside. The crew has managed to fix the leaks, the pumps are still doing their work and the water level is starting to subside.Another update form the hydrophone operator, the enemy ship has slowed down and is doing a sweep with their own hydrophone. Silent running is once again ordered and the boat slowly ascends at 3 knots towards periscope depth. More splashes are heard, but far away now.Reaching 15m you take a peek through the periscope and spot the destroyer no more than 800m away passing across the bow from port to starboard. The ship is identified from the ships identification manual and calculations are made on speed and distance. The order is given to flood all forward torpedo tubes, and the dull scraping of metal on metal can be heard as the doors open.The pings start again and you give the order to fire. You can hear the whoosh as each fish sets on its way, and behind you the hydropohone operator confirms all torpedos are on course. All that can be heard now is the tick, tick, tick, of the stopwatch, and the breathing of the crew.Through the periscope you see a flash and a round lands no further than a few feet away from the viewfinder. Dive, dive, dive. The periscope is lowered just as the stopwatch stops ticking. More seconds go past and the weapons officer whispers ""i think they all missed..."", just as the navigation officer calls out a depth of 50m.Then there is an almighty explosion, and the crew cheers. ""direct hit"" calls out the hydrophone opererator and you give the order to ascend to periscope depth. Taking a peek you see for the first time the carnage. A torpedo hit almost directly in the centre of the ship, breaking the ship clean in half. Bodies and wreckage lay strewn hundreds of metres around the remains, the sea ablaze with escaping diesel and oil.The boat surfaces and a message is send to HQ. '1 warship destroyed = 1200 tons, 12 torpedos remaining. Light damage'""Get those tubes reloaded, then get some rest comrades, soon we will reach the convoy lanes, and that is where the real fun begins...""			"

												After recruiting your crew, you accept a patrol mission that will last months, starting for famous harbours you manoeuver your beautifull boat manually untill you  can't see the coast anymore. and then the hunt starts, patroling for hundred, and even thounsands of miles, you head in the approximative direction of ennemy convoys or isolated targets reported by friendly boats and planes, relying on your instinct and radar/sonar technolgies still in infancy.After the satisfaction of finding your prey, you have to approach it silently and position yourself in a good spot to fire your torpedoes. You're watching at 5 major ships among a 40 units convoy burn and sink epically with a big smile on your face that won't last too long tho, because it's time to escape, getting chased by 3 or 4 anti-sub frigates trying to dodge their nukes, staying as much silent as possible... That's when you can really feel the sweat on your back and it's scary enough to squeeze your cheeks for when you're crew desperatly try to repair your sinking boat with some of them doing the great sacrifice to save you.If you've watched ""Das Boot"" the best movie ever made on Uboats, this game will allow you to feel like you're Capt.-Lt Henrich Lehmann-Willenbrock, played by a stunning Jürgen Prochnow, wait no, played by you this time ;)With a still very active and incredibly dedicated community that enhanced this aging game with incredible mods, raising it's graphics and functionalities tremendously. Go for it. It's the best of the Silent Hunter serie by far. just google ""gwx sh3 mod"" and you're set.			"

But there are still some negative points , the resolution is looked at 1024x768 and there are no widescreen options (released in early 2005), but mods are availible which deals with monitor options. Also some important interfaces are only accessible through hotkeys (like the radio messages) and not with the main interface.>>> And of course no annoying starforce copy protection, best point so far! :) <<<There is a great Modder Community! I can recommend the ""Grey Wolfes Mod / Expansion Pack. Works totally fine with Steam.http://www.thegreywolves.com/ "

												THE Silent Hunter game and the last one you didn't have to activly fight with bugs more so than the enemy Destroyers.Still, it aged a bit but for that we have the community. There are two essencial modifications that you need for this game to look and play up to spec:- The total overhaul, get the torrent - http://www.thegreywolves.com/downloads/- The resolution mod (you will need to register or bug me about the file) - http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=1092The second one is a bit tricky to use but it's worth it:1. First follow the readme to activate and configuring it.2. Unfortunatly there is a bug that comes with this modification and results in you accidently firing your torpedoes, to 'fix it' you will have to follow the instructions here - http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/showpost.php?p=1517282&postcount=6 - this is basically a tradeoff where the 'fire torpedo' buttons are disabled in-game but you are still able to use your keyboard - leaving 'Ctrl+Enter' (in GWX) or 'Enter' in Stock SH3 to release your fish.3. The game crashes for me if I try launching it through Steam with the resolution mod, but works if I go through the launch exe in the game's folder. Be advised.Good hunting.			"

												Very steep learning curve, but also quite rewarding. Reminds me of the old Secret Weapons of the Luff. by lucasArts, where it's incredibly deep and drawn out, despite it being repetitive. Definitely not a pick up and play title, requires serious attention to survive as the game is brutally unforgiving. The satisfaction of returning to safely to dock from a mission is almost as powerful as the fear of suddenly realizing you are running out of air, can't dive any deeper, and a bombardment of mines is heading down.

												At first glance, this game seems like a waste of money perhaps. Grahpics aren't anything special, and the aspect ratio is small. But, then you play the game a little longer, it begins to grow on you. The way you can customize the realism of what it was like to plot at the open seas, in a submarine. The way you plot how you will bring down your enemy. The action, the thirll and the temptation overwhelms you. But then, you begin to play even longer. Your palms sweaty, your back stuck to the seat.

												I remember the most tense moment I have ever had playing this game , the first time I shot a torpedo to sink a boat.Now you can just go shooting these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s willy nilly; the torepdos are limited. They are a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥to reload. If they hit at the wrong angle, they can just bounce of the ship. If they malfunction, you can give your position away. So many things can go wrong. Sometimes the boats are too fast, they speed away past you before you can set up. They may ping you, and may be inclined to ram your sub or drop depth charges. They may call for air support to strafe and destroy your sub.But when things go right, boy they go right.Very rarely do I feel inclined to write any review for any game, and definently not serious ones. But oh man you guys, this game.I got this game as a gift, a cheap one that me and my friends could hope to just play some multiplayer. With that pack, all the games didnt really have any multiplayer so that fell through the roof. But I decided to give this one a shot. And I am so glad I did.This game is a fantastic arcade take on a Sim. It can be super serious, it can be relaxing and fun. It can be brutal, terrifying, hilarious, stressful, all of those things at once. Nothing like this games campaign have I ever played anywhere else.You start off as a submarine captain, and take on the role really of destroying shipping and enemy ships. You are the hunter. Rarely do you find anything that can challenge you. You sink tonnage like no tommorrow and the numbers add up. Germany pushes and more and more, it looks like you will win the war. Then the game changes.So slowly over time, more noticably with every patrol you are assigned, the game gets scarier. The destroyers pop up en mass. Convoys move together, and develop tactics. Friendly subs get destroyed every day. It becomes less about sinking ships on your patrol route and more about surviving the war. I spent time just praying that the months would zoom by between each patrol. You buy as many upgrades as you can, hoping that you can survive just a little longer; that your crew has a chance to live. Nothing quite like it.It was a summer day, on my first patrol, and I hadnt seen anything for the entirety of the patrol. On the way back to base, I finally get hit with one of those markers; a ship not far away. I set up in the perfect postion, just off the coast where he would pass in front of me not 400 meters away. The water was soft, peaceful and calm with no heavy waves. Out of the crisp water stuck my little periscope, scanning the horizon, until finally she appeared. She came chugging along, a little french shipping vessel. You cant help but think of the people on this poor little ship. Closer and closer she sailed until she finally was just to my left. Timing it just correctly, I fired the first torpedo. The anticipation and andrenaline of shooting a torpedo, that time you have to wait tensely just hoping and praying that it will hit correctly, or at all... I dont think I have felt a feeling quite like it since.Finally a glorius explosion.This game is worth so much guys, give it a change and you will love it.			"

												October 4, 1940My U-boat, U-105, is chasing down a radio contact of a large convoy in the area. The seas buck like an untamed bronco and the fog thick as pea soup. We run on the surface to catch up with the convoy, when suddenly...""Contact! Merchant, close.""close? how close?... oh. *waves to the sailors on the ship's deck*ok too close DIVEDIVEDIVE!!!The small cargo ship must have radioed our position (kinda hard to miss when we're literally spitting distance off their prow), for a destroyer was bearing down on us no more than ten minutes later.We were only at periscope depth when the destroyer passed overhead, scraping our boat in the process. It circled around, beginning its sweep.ping....    ping.....   Ping. Ping. Ping.""Depth charges in the water, sir!""you know the drill ahead flank bearing 27-BAM! BAM! BAM!aft torpedo and diesel engine rooms are flooding.double♥♥♥♥♥♥I've had issues with scrapes in the past, so I had the forsight of bringing a repair officer before leaving port. As he led the repair efforts, our bow raised 45 degrees as we began to descend uncontrollably.30 meters.50 meters.it'll take ~3 minutes to stop the flooding75 meters.we're sinking faster100 meters.150 meters.""We're reaching critical depth, sir!""200 meters.c'mon guys, don't let me down...250 meters.""We can't go any deeper, sir!""315 meters.flooding stopped!310 meters.oh thank god, we're ascending...300 meters.crack.crunch.psssssshhhhhh....FFFFFFWWWWWWWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!....The Atlantic claimed 51 lives that evening, and the convoy continued untouched.(This real moment of intensity, terror, hope, and despair are brought to you by Ubisoft's Silent Hunter III and the Grey Wolves Gold mod pack, aka GWX Gold)Hopefully I'll learn from this experience (probably not) and have better luck on my next campaign. Good hunting!			"

												The best submarine game sim to date. Having played it many yearse previous on a physical copy I had to repurchase it for a digital version. It's an oldie, and a game which others should have inspired from, yet game developers being too lazy or fearful of doing so for some insane reason. The whole awesome idea of free-roaming, being led to a general area to do as you desire, and to chose what target you want to hunt enroute & in your patrol area. The whole awesome bit of tending to the crew, weapon choices, the customization, and the whole freedom of it all. Everything about this freedom of choice & the way you tackle it is what makes this game so special. It boggles my mind as to why no game developer since wants to make something like Silent Hunter 3 with 2016 game mechanics & resources. Yes, we do have World of Warships, yet that doesn't count because it won't last as Silent Hunter 3. Once WoWS is gone, so are the ships. The beauty of Silent Hunter 3 is that its singleplayer, something you can mod, and something you can have fun with.I love how the atmosphere, the mood, and the grittiness stick in this game. Same with how awesome the models, the visuals, and everything holds up to 2016 standards. It all appears glorious that this game stays as my favourite, even as time goes by. I have to also hold this game highly because it's a Romanian Ubisoft gaming studio, something North Americans struggle with when making war games. Europeans tends to add in variety while North Americans blindly stick to North American point of view. The beauty of this game also lies with how there's variety in nations, and even some ship types. The music itself also holds itself up strongly, even in 2016. It still has that nice gritty mood to it with no comical sound-effects, just pure German warfare thoughts & pride. Even though I never managed to live long enough to pass the first year (my saves used to get messy), I still love this game lots. I miss my trusty VIIB that I'm wanting it back again, and to eventually surpass 10 patrols while relearning & learning new things about this game, missing it many years previous. Relearned how to make my torpedoes swim faster, getting nicer kills in the process. I love how you can roam around the submarine, peak from the periscope, peak from the bridge, or even manually man the deck gun. There's so many visually pleasing & complex parts to this game that everything is satisfying and rewarding. No matter what you do, it's all fun. Even with how you can add decals to your subs, or how the way you can map out ship directions. You have to plot your actions accordingly that the in game map is powerful enough to allow you to do what you need to do. The rest? Up to you and the mods for added fun.The down-side to this game lies with the whole multiplayer & variety of things. For multiplayer you're given no freedom by being dumped into scenarios. It's not fun. I'm still recalling an unfun session I had by being dumped next to a convoy while shouting at an old friend whom couldn't do anything. I was a kid then & my temper was fierce & spoiled. I regret shouting at him after being forced to dive fairly deep while being unable to do anything. I was hoping more for free-roaming co-op with a comrade to randomly sail the seas to then hunt freely, something I""m wishing the new 'UBOOT' kickstarter game to do. As for the 'variety of things', that basically means more ship types could have been added to SH3 to add in more war boats, more convoy related ships, more 'forgotten' vessels, among others. That, and Ubisoft is blind to what makes Silent Hunter 3 fun, and as to not 'remastering' this game to 2016 standards. It's a real shame. It's an odlie, but the best sub sim & open world game around with no equal.Give it a try to see why Silent Hunter 3 is the best, and as to why I keep shaming game studios for being lazy idiots for not inspiring & building off of the success & strong points of Silent Hunter 3. There's still a market for these games, and there's still a giant void to be filled. World of Warships scratches the itch, just doesn't heal it. It feels good when you scratch it, just doesn't help anything in any way. Uboot is a Kickstarter game inspiring from this, yet it may end up doing the same thing in a more complex & punishing manner. I'm hoping for someone to make a modern 2016 Silent Hunter 3 (more so with full range of surface ships) because the naval genre is still quite empty & forgotten. You can agrue as much as you want, yet you can't deny there's no open world war games.			"

												This is a solid game that features a small set of single player scenarios as well as a true dynamic campaign. While there are several top notch mods available that really turn this into something extraordinary, the vanilla game itself is quite enjoyable and should provide hours of game play. The scalable difficulty level also can change how you play and on the higher levels the effort put into learning how to manually setup and fire a torpedo can be quite satisfying.			"

												The first Silent Hunter game, I played as a kid. I remember buying this game when it first came out in stores and this is by far the best Silent Hunter, in the entire series. Silent Hunter 4, in my opion is the last game that works Silent Hunter 5, is a half finished game that you have to mod in order to fully enjoy this game is what Silent Hunter, is all about and best of all you can choose what year to start your career. Until 1943 but the campign continues until 1945 when Germany surrenders to the allies. After 1943, being on the surface is a death trap especially when the allied submarine hunter groups are formed. I highly recmoend either GWX or Living Silent Hunter to enjoy this great game even more my personal preference is GWX, Living Silent Hnter, adds more details to the game where as GWX adds more story into the games great story.

												Silent Hunter 3 is likely the best Submarine Simulation on the market from the German perspective of the war, if you prefer to play as an American Submarine you'll have to get Silent Hunter 4, and I recomend avoiding SH5 like the plague. I picked up this game back in 2005 on its release and haven't stopped going back to it. Purchased on steam just to avoid having to dig out the disk. For the best experience on a modern PC I suggest getting the GWX 3.0 Gold Mode, along with the rez fixer mod. You don't have to, it just improves a lot that was lacking on the 2005 release that never got Patched in. http://www.subsim.com/radioroom/downloads.php?do=file&id=1092 <-- This is where you'll be able to find all the mods i noted above, along with many i have never tried.

												First things first, I love it, it's like being captain in the film Das Boot (you can even mod this in)...Total immersion. Literally and figuratively. Loads of attention to detail. Stalking and hunting is very tense, as is being hunted by planes and convoy escorts. Crew skill increases with experience.The steep learning curve is assisted by tailoring the difficulty, and vanilla is fun, but for real reward join the SUBSIM modding community which is friendly, welcoming and helpful. There is even a a huge library of submarine information - which tells you something about what sort of gamer who will embrace SH3.If you download SH3 Commander you can enable a tailored career even to the level of datestamping music and reportage of the time. There are a number of mega mods out there of which  GWX 3.0, Grey Wolves seems to be the favourite for more challenging and realistic gameplay. There are also a whole raft of graphics, sound and specific gameplay mods that will increase authenticity and atmosphere including ways of incorporating graphics of later editions such as SH4 and SH5.   The game will run on different platforms, I successfully run the game with much of the above mentioned, in compatibility mode through WIndows 10 with enhanced screen resolution.If this kind of game appeals to you, you will love it and at this price you would be crazy to miss out, if you are a FPS kind of gamer, you may want to look elsewhere.

												It's 1944. January. The Wermancht is slowly being pushed back by the Soviet Union, and the Allies plan their invasion of France. Things are looking grim for the German war machine. Many look to the renmants of its once-mighty U-boat fleet to perform a miracle and strangle Great Britain's supply line, but you know better.You are the commander of U-99, and you patrol the North Sea in a vain attempt to find something, anything, to sink. Then, your spot something on the horizon. Smoke. Possibly an unescorted supply ship. You try to get a better look at the distant ship, and your heart sinks when you spot more smoke. Not a single supply ship, but a fleet of destroyers. A fleet coming right toward you. You give the order for a crash dive, and the sub quickly sinks below the frigid waters.Minutes pass. Hours. Eventually your hydrophone operator reports them cruising right above you, apparently oblivious to your presence. After another nail-biting hour, their engines fade into the distance.You got lucky. With a deep breath, you order the sub to silently cruise underwater, before surfacing to recharge its batteries. Silent Hunter III is a U-Boat simulator, and probably the best one in the series. Your objective is simple: sink as much of the Allied fleet as you possibly can. This goal becomes more and more difficult as WWII drags on, and by the end you're thinking less of how many ships you'll sink during one tour than whether or not you'll survive. This game can be as tense as any survival horror. If you're a fan of any kind of vehicle simulaton game, or just a WWII buff, buy this and buy it right now.			"

												                         This is naval simulation ( any sim really ) at its very finest. The historical accuracy blends perfectly with the challenge of play, itself carefully stepped upwards from the novice to the expert using trig in order to set up shots that send even the biggest ships down to Davy Jones Locker. Campaign play is tight and moves well as the war and U-boat improvements advance. And with the mods generously provided by the folks at SUBSIM, even more historical accuracy is achieved in what was one of the greatest, and for both sides, most terrifying campaigns of the Second World War. A 10, out of 10. Easily the best of the Silent Hunter series.			"

												I love this game more than its sequals; The freedom you have as a captain and the way nothing interferes with that freedom, like an intrusive storyline or cutscenes really make this my all time favorite. Add to that the sheer control you have over your not only your submarine, with all the upgrades and replacements thereof, but also your crew and their assigned workplaces, specializations, skills and the occasional pinning of the medals make this the cream of the crop.The only downside to the game that I noticed was the lack of settings, especially those related to display. But apart from the screen showing a black unused space both left and right of the display and the low quality (by todays standard) are nothing compared to the fun and tense moments this game provides.

Thus makes them all the more satisfing when they occur.Get the GWX expansion too.  The additions to the vanilla game are dizzying.

												Bottom line:Interested in a WWII uboat simulator?Then there is no debate, no doubt.  This is hands down the -Best- there is.Note that i said -simulator- (not game). because the game is so immersive and there are so many things to do and be aware of, that it feels like a simulator more than a game. And yes there is a learning curve, but there are also 100 tons of resources online to help you get the hang of it quickly and painlessly. If you prefeer a more ""gamey"" experience, you might want to look at other titles like crash dive, but trust me, this game is so good, its worth its learning curve.The vanilla game itself will provide you with 100s of hours of fun, but if you want even more, get one of the excellent supermods, like GWX3, or LSH3 and youre set for a long long time.If you are concerned about its age, it looks surprisingly good for a game that came out over 10 years ago, and its looks can be improved with mods. And the truth is even with its old graphics this game provides more immersion than any of the more recent and better looking submarine games out there. Want to feel like in that movie ""Das boot""? then get this game. 10/10.As a side note: If you are considering getting Silent Hunter 5 instead because ""its newer and it looks cooler"" DONT. SH5 is a broken bugfest that requires countless hours of reading and searching to play. Not because the game is hard, but because you need to learn about the dozens of mods and community patches you need to apply to even be able to play it. And even when you get it going, its gameplay is not one tenth as good as this one.			"

Ultimate Silent Hunter Challenge Play on all realism settings. Start your career in 1939. DO NOT play above x1 speed. ONLY save your game once every 12 hours. ONLY save your game surfaced and out of combat. ONLY reload your save once every 24 hours. YOU MUST manually drive your ship back to port at the end of each patrol. If you are in combat you CAN NOT quit out of the game. If you lose your ship then you must start the game from the very begining. In order to win the challenge, you must survive the war.

The settings can be altered to make it fairly casual and easy, or you can set it to where you have to identify enemy ships just by the outline they cast on the horizon. Produced in 2005, the game still looks and plays great all things considered. And the feeling you get when you sink a convoy of warships is awesome.			"

												I have put over 300 hours into this game. There aren't many sub simulations out there and this is a good one. However, it crashes periodically so save often. Gameplay is smooth and the graphics are good for the release date. Patience is required since time is spent fast forwarding thru a patrol until you get some action. Crew management can get a little tiresome on long patrols. All in all, well worth the investment.			"

												The mods occupy more memory space than the game, and the replayability is almost limitless, because the AI can defeat you. A WWII Sub has few moves available to attack or evade. Moreover, Steam made it possible to play that game on Vista, Windows 7. The entertainment level is very high for the initial financial investment. Thus i would offer my recomendation for the die hard NSS fans that like to use their pocket calculators, a pencil and a piece of papers to calculate a course, instead of the CPU of their state of the art gaming computer.

												It is safe to say that war provides the most popular structure within games, so when faced with the prospect of taking up 'yet another war game', people can be forgiven for choosing to spend their time elsewhere.Let me contest that idea in relation to Silent Hunter III, or SHIII (coincidentally a sound you might make a lot whilst playing the game). SH3 is set against the backdrop of WW2 (in its entirety), but it is a different beast to any shooter or RTS. The war is definitely going on out there, but you're merely a boat in the ocean and your focus is your orders, your crew and the deep waters immediately out around you. In historical writings this ocean arena is referred to with reverance for both sides playing a high stakes chess game in an isolated battlefield with little of the political discolourings of the mainland.One of those games to draw you in and hold your attention across many hundreds of hours.NOTE: the Grey Wolves 3 mod is considered MANDATORY!

												Just like fine wine, this game aged well. Though there are problems because it was made a long time ago, solutions are easy. The community has also contributed well with beautiful mods that just increase the immersion. I've found myself whispering while a destroyer searches for me on the surface. I've found my heart racing during the same scenario. The sequels make this game shine even more. The Silent Hunter series is essentially dead as of right now. This game is a gem for any of the few people that like the submarine simulator genre. Definitely a must-buy			"

												Great game which takes some time to master.  Definitely add the GWX mod.  I have played this game more than one time, so I have the hours racked up on it.  It's easier than mastering a sub simulator like Sub Command.  Nice interface to make your own missions.Bugs:  You will occasionally spend time sinking a ship and it will not be counted as being ""sunk.""           On my computer the graphics sometimes flake out until restart on heavy particles (smoke fire)Only real complaint is that the game campaign needed an ending.  It really doesn't have one.  When you finish your final patrol at the end of the war, the game just sort of stops.  Would have been better to show a resolution like the subs being bombed, being taken prisoner or something.... "

												Not only is this the best sub sim ever made is definitely one of the best games ever made standing only with titans such as Death to Spies, Hitman: Blood Money and Mount and Blade: Warband.SH3 features full controls of just about every aspect of a sub.  Do-it-your-selfers will enjoy calculating torpedo trajectories, assigning the most qualified crew man to each post in the sub and even shooting the deck guns in first person.  By the end of 1942 its hard to tell who's hunting who as Allies develop more brutal and effective weapons and tactics to put and end to your rein of terror on the high seas.Fortunately the difficulty is fully adjustable so you can give your self some help if needed, but navigating without aides and acquiring, tracking, and destroying targets by hand with dive bombers and and destroyers hot on your tail gives a satisfaction rarely seen in even the newest and most hyped games.

But I found a manual online https://www.scribd.com/doc/129646197/Silent-Hunter-3-Manual and got to grips with a few things. It's a pretty good game, although you don't get to play as anything but Nazi, which is a bit different. Still and all, it's a lot of fun.

												Steam version doesn't have Starforce,bear in mind this game is almost 10 years old, however install GWX and the Interiors mod,plus a few others from Subsim and you have a great game, that easily defeats the rest of the series in terms of gameplay,tension etc,the only drawback is it's graphics and resoulution, which can be fixed to a certain extent,W10 users may have problems with this game, on W7 it runs fine			"

												One of my fravret games of all time. Like with Rome total war, 1 not 2, there is something about this game that was done so well nothing after it comes close. It has a steep learning curve if you turn the help down but with it left alone its still enjoyable. It dose have some bugs still to this day as dose all ubesoft games but nothing like more modern titels. Don't get Silent Hunter 4 it was so bugy thay gave up on it. If you want to try another one try silent hunter 5 it has alot of cons but the grafix are more modern and you can walk around the ship fully in it. Overall this is a solid 9 outa 10. There's only a few things interface wise that'll make you made and lets not talk multi player other then that. Best game of 2005 in my book.			"

												This is one awesome simulator.To those of you who are actually having trouble getting it to work, welp, good luck with Windows 8 and 10 or whatever, because I am having no issues with Windows 7 x64. It's your fault for upgrading to a pair of bad operating systems.The game works, it's relatively pretty, there's still plenty of modding support, it's extremely boring with periods of stellar excitement, and you get to be a sub commander. It's great.Now, really, if you play career... you are going to spend 90% of your time waiting to encounter some enemy ships. Not actually encountering them. But I don't even care. Because there's always something to do. You have to rearrange your crew every now and then to ensure they all stay healthy, and this is a simulation, what do you expect.I'm impressed by the way the interface works. Lots of clicking on various GUI objects and things. I really like it. I wouldn't say everything is intuitive, but after a bit of fiddling around you can pretty much start to get a sort of workflow going.Also, it's one of the few simulation type games I've played which doesn't look absolutely horrible while simultaneously running poorly.But if you're honestly considering this game, ask yourself. Would you play ARMA without mods? If the answer is yes, perhaps you can stand being bored for long enough to enjoy Silent Hunter 3.			"

												TIPS FOR NEW PLAYERS: Download the GWX 3 Supermod. Install the No faitigue mod, if crew tiredness irritates you. - PLAYThe immersion factor of this sim is high enough to keep anyone occupied for a long time. The tension of sitting silently beneath the waves, whilst being relentlessly hunted, is something you have to experience for yourself. On the other hand, the satisfaction of sinking a ship, then making a run for it, brings an incredible sense of acheivement. I have to say also, that the deck gun makes for a welcome change, when circumstances allow.The best version of the best sub sim ever! Buy it!			"

												I played Silent hunter III when it was new and absolutely loved itI don't know what has happened in the intermidiate years but it seems that the RAF has suddenly begun to fine comb the entire north atlantic with Lancaster and Swordfish bombers on an hourly basis. You litterally cannot surface your boat anywhere south of greenland without being pounced by bombers.  It's neither realistic nor fun.EDIT: A bit of clarification, as I realised that ""south of greenland"" is somewhat ambigous. I prefer to operate out of Bergen which means having to navigate north of the british isles to get to the patrol sectors in the central atlantic. I tried several different routes to get there and anything short of sailing way north and hugging the southeastern coast of greenland would immidately draw the ire of RAF. No amount of underwater erratic saling would shake them, as soon as I surfaced, bam. There they were again. They certainly didn't have this behavior when I last played the game so I suspect some sort of patch has been involved to force players to take exactly that route to greenland which means north atlantic missions get excessively long and BORING (you hardly find anything worth sinking up there)I don't mind being chased by a flotillia of destroyers, that's what makes this game so intense. But Bomber harrasment of this magnitude seems pointless, as there is really nothing you can do about it, save for remaining submerged and hope they loose interest before you loose battery power and oxygen			"

Why?all missions in the career mode are drastically slurb: every mission ""to reach patrol grid"" is in the same way, it is randomly pointed grid, here is no transport lines, no chances to meet any high-class warship...These reasons are not  to buy next releases. Here is only one very-very interest moment: ""historical mode"" at early of the career mode, manual targeting, real hunt... but is very short.			"

												When it comes to World War II submarine games, you'll not find one better than this. Whereas the rest of the Silent Hunter games generally fall flat on their faces, this one is well-made and very authentic. If you like tense simulation games that will require a whole lot of thinking and careful maneuvering, then this game will be a great fit for you.Note, however, that the very authenticity of the game makes for a high learning curve. It'll take you some time to become accustomed to the game. Though becoming skilled at the gameplay is quite rewarding, be prepared for some time spent learning the game before you'll become effective at it. If you're looking for a game that won't require much time expenditure, this might not be the game for you.All in all, this is a niche title. I don't recommend it.			"

												Hope you enjoy 1024x720 resolutions!  It's hard coded into this 'game'.  Looks to be a lovely sim and is rated highly, however, those of us with modern systems would do well to bear in mind this requirement before purchasing.It's still a functional game after you mod the /Documents/SH3/Data/CFG/main.cfg to Fullscreen=No  but the fact that I'm required to on a game that a company is still charging quite a bit of cash for is silly.  Hence the big red No.Now that I've spent 3 hours of my life debugging a game to the point of getting a menu screen finally, I'll go play and hopefully enjoy it despite the sick taste in the back of mouth from yet another Ubisoft product that doesn't work on my hardware.. (I'm looking at you Ghost Recon...)			"

												This is an interesting game. Basically you commandeer a WWII Nazi submarine and hunt down enemy merchant and warships. Here's the part that I struggled with in this game and led to my disliking it: playing the game in a way that is most satisfying requires doing incredibly difficult things, things that require (OH F***) math! Plotting intercept courses, manual torpedo solutions, etc. all require a knowledge of trigonometry and angles that the tutorial does not cover. This presents a problem to people like myself who graduated a while ago and can't remember a thing related to math, other than basic concepts. The reason I say that doing the above things is the most satisfying way to play is because when I played on easy settings, where the AI does all the torpedo calculations and course calculations, I felt like I was a lazy, under-qualified ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ captain who did nothing by himself and who inherited the position of captain because all other candidates onboard the sub were killed by chestbursters and the Alien. I felt cheap, in other words, because then it just became to easy. You might say ""Geez dumbass, why not look up how to do these things on the interwebs and the internets?"" Well, peeps, I did do that. And you know what? It made me feel worse, cuz I still didn't ever successfully intercept a ship.Now, if you are in high school and have a fresh knowledge of trig and math, then you may like this game, because other than the incredible difficulty, everything else is great. The graphics are good, the sub exterior and interiors look awesome. No complaints there.In summary, only buy this if you have an understanding of trigonometry and angles and will put serious effort into this game. Otherwise, watch ""Hunt for Red October""			"

												I picked up this game in the hopes of playing a stimulating and accurate submarine hunter game.When I first loaded this game up, to my dismay, it runs is a lower resolution, not at my 1080p resolution of my monitor.The lower resolution of the game made me almost want to put it down, but I persisted, albeit with the somewhat weak visuals.Within a few minutes I realized this game has a very steep learning curve, but one that I have found reasonable as time goes on.This game is complex and appears to be realistic( I have never been in a submarine). Lots of control panels indicated your depth, c02 levels, pressure, different kinds of deck gun shells, torpedoes, etc.The complexity of this title is appealing, as it leads to more in depth gameplay and I like that. It took me about 3 hours to figure out how to maneuver my uboat somewhat decently, fire off the deck guns, and launch torpedoes terribly off the mark.Just the training has left me feeling a little eager to try myself in real(albeit simulated) combat.I continue the training and work on my torpedoes. They bounce off, they miss, they are in limited supply. Its moderately frustrating.The visuals continue to be unappealing, and I decide to drop the game. My opinion is that a game of this type requires better visuals, and therefore I dropped it. I am not sure if I will try again, but I doubt it. For this reason, I do not recommend the game, even though I have, on many occasions, been able to look past visual elements without an issue. "

												This must be a candidate for 1 of the most boring games ever made.You'll spend lots of time looking at an old map. Occassionally you'll get notified of a sonic contact, so you'll engage and spend the next 3 hours trying to track something, when you finally make visual contact you realise it's a small fishing boat and you've just wasted hours of your actual life on this crap.Very little happens, I dont understand why it has the following it has, and neither do I understand why this games vast army of modders couldnt make a mod that made the game more engaging, or so that somethign actually happens.It's very dull. I don't recommend it.			"

												SH3 is a nice game, but it's also a little complicate to understand in some parts and it can be boring...I actually enjoyed it and i'm playing it sometimes, it's not that type of game you'll stay there hours and hours playing, but it can give you one full hours of fun...It can be really interesting for people how like history, expecialy the second world war part ovviestly, because this game really give you the experience of what was it like to be the captain of a U-boat in that period...Grafich is also quite nice (considered it's not so new) ando the audio is good, tutorial are quite difficult to understand and they tell you a lot of things but when you understand the basics is quite simple...One last thing, if you want a game of intens action just don't buy this, you'll be bored quite soon.

												Another personal favourite of mine that I keep returning to. SHIII is an excellent game, with in-depth (no pun intended) mechanics and realistic simulation aspects. I'll examine my pros and cons fro the game, as it would be difficult to write an entire review about it and keep it succinct. Pros:Excellent interface: With such a complicated game, it would be easy to cllutter the screen with a billion little buttons. The inclusion of several different interfaces that are easy to get to allows easy navigation of not  nly the massive world, but also the beautifully baffling complexity of the game.Time compression: While the sense of scale of a full size Atlantic Ocean is impressive, I can't imagine how dull it would be to sit down and do noting for weeks of real life time. Allowing the player to manipulate the time by speeding it up by up to 1040 times facilitates much wuicker travel.Realism options: I'm not gonna lie, I'm a scrub. I can't do anything on high difficulties. I was very happy to discover an option given right off the bat that can be changed at nearly any time. This ooption allowed me to avoid some pitfalls that would have destroyed me within minutes. I don't need to surface to vent CO2, and I believe that the boat can take more damage. There's other options that I can't remember off the top of my head.Combat: Some of the tensest moment I've experienced in all of my time playing PC games, or indeed, any games, have been during Silent Hunter combat. A destroyer detecting you can be a death sentence, so encountering one can immediately ratchet up your stress level. Of course, you need to sink that tonnage. So, there's always a decision to make. Do you turn on silent running and dive a a few score meters, or do you put your attack periscope up and put a couple fish in the water, knowing full well that they could detect you at any moment and open up on you with a massive deck gun before going right over you and depth charging the water? A daring captain might take a page out of Clark Gable's book in 'Run silent, Run Deep', and get the destroyer to head your way, full steam before you fire torpedoes. The tension and choices of the game are immersive.There are, of course, more pros that I can't put down now, as I can't think of them.Cons:You are a Nazi: Well, you may not share the insane philosophies of Reich brass, but your character serves one of the most evil governments that the world has ever seen. Fortunately, this fact is dulled by the lack of anything that would detract from the gameplay, so there is no hateful ideology directly in the game.No Steam Workshop Modding Suppourt/ Developer's Console: I know that the game is about realism and the problems one faces as a submarine captain in the age before advanced targeting systems and onboard homing devices, but sometimes, I can't help but wish that I could put a nuclear homing torpedo in the water and instantly blow up a warship, or fearlessly ram a destroyer, splitting it in half. Also, due to the large number of models, it would be extemely difficult to retexture the game to make it feel, somehow, even more realistic.No Online Play: It's an old game, and Ubisooft no longer has servers for it, though I've heard some great stories from people who played it when online play was a thing.Time compression does not work when close to shore: It's good to remember that the next con I have is a personal one, designed to prevent someone from bottoming out or beaching the boat in shallow water, but it can make prowling fjords and areas around harbours very tedious, while getting out of some friendly docks can be a pain, with the time compression slowing down to four times, especially in one French port, whch I can't remember the name of.Looking back at what I've written, I realize that though I attempted to review such a complex game in a succinct manner, I've only succeeded in writing a full length review. Now, though, I'll brand the game and end the review with a numerical score.9.2/10Would play again.And again.And again.			"

												This is THE BEST submarine simulator. Why?- can customize your gameplay from complete beginner to complete master- good graphics, sound- can control how fast or slow the game goes thanks to speeding up of processes option- realism can be customized- fun campaigns- option to play set scenarios for immediate action- a big modding community extends the game's lifespan greatly- a practice section where you can freely learn how to control your complex sub without pressureNow you might wonder about the sequels to this game SH4 and 5. I've played both and both lack the fun here and both feature too many frustrating bugs (especially 5) and crashes (my PC almost never crashes from a game but with these SH4/5 it happens too often). Both require modding to actually fulfill their potential whereas SH3 doesn't NEED to be modded to be great.There are other sub games but SH is the go-to brand for sub sims.			"

												This is the real♥♥♥♥♥♥ the big one, its as precise as can be. Realism settings require alot of planing, working into it and understanding your sub. For people who like this stretched out gameplay, thats really trying to be true to life. Buy it. If you want some casual ship sinking adventures...I can't quite recommend it, you may aswell just play Battlestations. Only downside is, it has no submarines.Also, prepare for the comedic moment when your U-Boat is leaking and your crew just doesnt care about it at all			"

												Gem of a game and an amazing reboot back in 2005, I must have played this on and off for 3 years after its release all those years ago, The GWX 3.0 Mod gives it a whole lot more life too.Still plays great but graphics are pretty bad in 2015 - mainly since the game is locked to a resolution of 1024x768. :( Ubi absolutley treated this game like garbage post release, patching it to the bear minimum, then leaving it modders to fix and expand.SH5 was ok, but a messy RPG/Sim concept and rushed out the door. Its frustrating that if you want a good U-boat sim you are forced to choose between SH III's excellent gameplay and campaign (but dated visuals) or SHVs more modern graphics (but with broken unfinished gameplay and campaign) :( Cant cave you cake and eat it sadly.

												Brilliant game, If you have any interest in naval warfare or ww2 you will enjoy playing this game. There is a great deal of depth in the games campaign that on first play through many users may miss. This includes improving the players submarine, retaining and recruiting crew members and the abilty to transfer to a diffrent base.This is a simulator game, but the realsim settings are very forgiving and the game should not take very long to get used to.I personally prefer this game to sh4 and 5. This game also has some excelent mods and there installation is easy using one of the several download managers their community has developed.Im not sure how good the tutorial stuff at the begining was, though when I first played this game I admit I had no clue where to go or how to go about things. If your digging the vibe but a bit put off by the diffuculty or whatever, I would strongly suggest watching 'Das Boot' This gem of a warfilm has very similar theme and subject matter.8/10 - I found looking for ships and ploting courses could become really tedious at times and that would be my only knock on this game.

												I have to say, Silent Hunter III is an AMAZING game. Although, it has some bugs, it's a fun, realistic game. And, if the realism is too much, you can tweak the settings for the perfect game play. If you enjoy submarines, and their history, and always have dreamed of operating one, this might get you as close as you ever will. Really enjoyable if you like to role-play. Turn the settings on realistic, and have fun trying to operate a WW2 u-boat. It isn't easy, but so much fun. I definitely suggest the training missions first, the controls are a little difficult to get use to, but you'll be alright!			"

												Симулятор капитана подводной лодки оказался не совсем тем что я ожидал- приготовьтесь часами плавать до берегов Британии, чтобы потом пару суток топить конвои). Однако, когда дело доходит до сражений игра очень затягивает. Не забудьте про ускорение времени, иначе будете плыть очень долго - успеете школу кончить, а война не пройдет.			"

												SH3 is a nice game, but it's also a little complicate to understand in some parts and it can be boring...I actually enjoyed it and i'm playing it sometimes, it's not that type of game you'll stay there hours and hours playing, but it can give you one full hours of fun...It can be really interesting for people how like history, expecialy the second world war part ovviestly, because this game really give you the experience of what was it like to be the captain of a U-boat in that period...Grafich is also quite nice (considered it's not so new) ando the audio is good, tutorial are quite difficult to understand and they tell you a lot of things but when you understand the basics is quite simple...One last thing, if you want a game of intens action just don't buy this, you'll be bored quite soon.

												Another personal favourite of mine that I keep returning to. SHIII is an excellent game, with in-depth (no pun intended) mechanics and realistic simulation aspects. I'll examine my pros and cons fro the game, as it would be difficult to write an entire review about it and keep it succinct. Pros:Excellent interface: With such a complicated game, it would be easy to cllutter the screen with a billion little buttons. The inclusion of several different interfaces that are easy to get to allows easy navigation of not  nly the massive world, but also the beautifully baffling complexity of the game.Time compression: While the sense of scale of a full size Atlantic Ocean is impressive, I can't imagine how dull it would be to sit down and do noting for weeks of real life time. Allowing the player to manipulate the time by speeding it up by up to 1040 times facilitates much wuicker travel.Realism options: I'm not gonna lie, I'm a scrub. I can't do anything on high difficulties. I was very happy to discover an option given right off the bat that can be changed at nearly any time. This ooption allowed me to avoid some pitfalls that would have destroyed me within minutes. I don't need to surface to vent CO2, and I believe that the boat can take more damage. There's other options that I can't remember off the top of my head.Combat: Some of the tensest moment I've experienced in all of my time playing PC games, or indeed, any games, have been during Silent Hunter combat. A destroyer detecting you can be a death sentence, so encountering one can immediately ratchet up your stress level. Of course, you need to sink that tonnage. So, there's always a decision to make. Do you turn on silent running and dive a a few score meters, or do you put your attack periscope up and put a couple fish in the water, knowing full well that they could detect you at any moment and open up on you with a massive deck gun before going right over you and depth charging the water? A daring captain might take a page out of Clark Gable's book in 'Run silent, Run Deep', and get the destroyer to head your way, full steam before you fire torpedoes. The tension and choices of the game are immersive.There are, of course, more pros that I can't put down now, as I can't think of them.Cons:You are a Nazi: Well, you may not share the insane philosophies of Reich brass, but your character serves one of the most evil governments that the world has ever seen. Fortunately, this fact is dulled by the lack of anything that would detract from the gameplay, so there is no hateful ideology directly in the game.No Steam Workshop Modding Suppourt/ Developer's Console: I know that the game is about realism and the problems one faces as a submarine captain in the age before advanced targeting systems and onboard homing devices, but sometimes, I can't help but wish that I could put a nuclear homing torpedo in the water and instantly blow up a warship, or fearlessly ram a destroyer, splitting it in half. Also, due to the large number of models, it would be extemely difficult to retexture the game to make it feel, somehow, even more realistic.No Online Play: It's an old game, and Ubisooft no longer has servers for it, though I've heard some great stories from people who played it when online play was a thing.Time compression does not work when close to shore: It's good to remember that the next con I have is a personal one, designed to prevent someone from bottoming out or beaching the boat in shallow water, but it can make prowling fjords and areas around harbours very tedious, while getting out of some friendly docks can be a pain, with the time compression slowing down to four times, especially in one French port, whch I can't remember the name of.Looking back at what I've written, I realize that though I attempted to review such a complex game in a succinct manner, I've only succeeded in writing a full length review. Now, though, I'll brand the game and end the review with a numerical score.9.2/10Would play again.And again.And again.			"

												This is the real♥♥♥♥♥♥ the big one, its as precise as can be. Realism settings require alot of planing, working into it and understanding your sub. For people who like this stretched out gameplay, thats really trying to be true to life. Buy it. If you want some casual ship sinking adventures...I can't quite recommend it, you may aswell just play Battlestations. Only downside is, it has no submarines.Also, prepare for the comedic moment when your U-Boat is leaking and your crew just doesnt care about it at all			"

												This is THE BEST submarine simulator. Why?- can customize your gameplay from complete beginner to complete master- good graphics, sound- can control how fast or slow the game goes thanks to speeding up of processes option- realism can be customized- fun campaigns- option to play set scenarios for immediate action- a big modding community extends the game's lifespan greatly- a practice section where you can freely learn how to control your complex sub without pressureNow you might wonder about the sequels to this game SH4 and 5. I've played both and both lack the fun here and both feature too many frustrating bugs (especially 5) and crashes (my PC almost never crashes from a game but with these SH4/5 it happens too often). Both require modding to actually fulfill their potential whereas SH3 doesn't NEED to be modded to be great.There are other sub games but SH is the go-to brand for sub sims.			"

												""Das muss das Boot abkönnen""...ja das werdet ihr euch oft denken wenn ihr dieses Grandiose Spiel spielt. Dieses Gefühl wenn man einen Frachter im Visier hat und ""Rohr 1..LOS!"" hört, gehört für mich zu denn Schönsten Momenten die mir ein Spiel geben kann. Atmosphärisch Grandios gemacht! Gut es lann zwar langweilig werden wenn man lange kein Schiff zu gesicht bekommt aber wenn man dann einen Konvoi entdeckt hat...dann sollte man ab besten schon mal die Torpedo Rohre Klar zum Schuss machen ;) Grafisch ist Sh3 vielleicht jetzt keine Bombe aber Spielerisch besser als Sh4 und Sh5! Sh3 ist absolut empfehlens wert für jeden der sich selbst einen ""Grauen Wolf"" nennt ^^			"

												This game is glorious. It combines very sophistocated stealth with strategy and simulation. You're no match for your many of your enemies in a firefight, and they will evade or relentlessly pursue you if your cover is blown. But if you're smart, and lethal, you will never be caught.			"

												Although you may think you've found easy prey, these torpedos have their weaknesses. Some leave a visible trail of bubbles likely to be seen by the crew of that destroyer you're firing at. Some have internal depth keeping malfunctions. And some are just plain duds. Highly, highly recommend especially as a game when traveling and no consistant internet access. Passes the time and you may even be forced to take on a destoryer with your deck gun. Highly entertaining but VERY dangerous early campaign.			"

												Probably the best Submarine simulator of all time, Silent Hunter III continues to have a small but dedicated fanbase on Subsim.com. Compared with the two later installments of the series, the game is much more polished with very few bugs. In addition, the game also has almost every sub the Germans used in the war, unlike Silent Hunter V with it's measly two versions of the same boat. Finally, Silent Hunter III is much more user friendly than IV or V, with better tutorials and user interface. The only game that might surpass it is the upcoming UBoot by Deep Water Studio. I eagerly await its release in 2017.			"

												Gem of a game and an amazing reboot back in 2005, I must have played this on and off for 3 years after its release all those years ago, The GWX 3.0 Mod gives it a whole lot more life too.Still plays great but graphics are pretty bad in 2015 - mainly since the game is locked to a resolution of 1024x768. :( Ubi absolutley treated this game like garbage post release, patching it to the bear minimum, then leaving it modders to fix and expand.SH5 was ok, but a messy RPG/Sim concept and rushed out the door. Its frustrating that if you want a good U-boat sim you are forced to choose between SH III's excellent gameplay and campaign (but dated visuals) or SHVs more modern graphics (but with broken unfinished gameplay and campaign) :( Cant cave you cake and eat it sadly.

												Excellent Sub Sim. On full real, it is complex, and engrossing. Using aids, such as target ID and firing solution calculations makes it much more a strategic/tactical simulator than full on sub sim. Crew management is really the meat and potatoes of the campaign mode. Engrossing, involving and addictive. You feel the pain when you lose a senior crew man or worse yet an experienced jr officer. The steam version runs very clean, even under Windows 10.			"

												A great submarine simulator, but unfortunatly not a great sub game. The major glaring problem I see with this game is that the missions (in the story mode) are litterally all the same. However, the game is redeemed with the ability for you to make your oun senarios. Thank goodness there is a great modding community. It helps with some minor bugs and they've upped the replay ability. However, most enthusiasts of the franchise have moved on to newer versions, albeit this title has the best acclaim of the franchise. 75%			"
