												Great tactical game (2006). Not a simulator, ""Game about War"". Graphics are nice and smooth, you may see details such holes on the walls or in the ground.There are some really enjoyable missions in this game that are very well designed.7/10			"

												I'm gonna give you an honest opinion:This game is great. If you like RTS, third-person shooter, strategy, and a challenge, this is for you. The levels are very nice and the mechanics compliment the time setting. It also has some pleasant blends including with Role Playing genre. However, the game does have its issues. For example, the objectives are obscure and I often find myself a few steps behind my computerized teammates. It still requires some work, because small issues, such as the ridiculously low health of armored heavy machine guns, or the surreptitious change in objective. Overall, I'd still recommend this game to anyone wanting a challenge or something different altogether.			"

												I really liked Faces of War.  If you enjoy WW2 real time strategies or other war RTS games, you will like this one.  There are three campaigns and each one has about 8 missions.  The missions are challenging, fun, and can often take a few hours to complete.  It took me over 40 hours to complete the game.  It could probably be beaten quicker.  However, I like to take my time.  I also got killed quite a few times and had to reload.  Of course I saved often throughout missions.One of the other things I liked was that although the game was challenging, it wasn't so hard that I would get stuck on missions.  There were a few missions that seemed impossible but I somehow got through them.  The game pace is good.If you are new to these games, play through the tutorials at least twice.  There are some things such as calling an ally.  I got about halfway through and forgot how to do that.  Calling an ally is helpful and I wish I would have done it sooner.  Also, some vehicles might not move, even though they are not damaged.  Check the gas.  The tutorial explains how to fill up a tank or other vehicle.  Trust me, having vehicles, especially armored ones, makes life much easier.The bottom line for me is that if you like RTS games, get this one.  I picked it up in a bundle with Men of War and had never heard of it prior to playing.  I'm glad I did.  Honestly, I would gladly pay the $4.99 for this game.			"

												Faces of War is a highly recommended strategy wargame which has been made by a collective of talented game developers. This isn't the first installation in their highly successful franchise, and for those players which are interested to see from where it all began, i suggest you purchase  Soldiers: Heroes of World War II In this review, i will try to keep the whole overview of the game as short and simple as possible, so you yourself decide, whether this title is for your future enjoyment or not. The first thing to actually keep in mind while looking at Faces of War is the fact that the game is rather old, and what used to be it's forte back in the day, to say the least, is now outdated - the graphics. Today, with games such as Company of Heroes 2 available on the market, this RTS looks a bit flat, but it is still nonetheless unique in many ways. One of it's bright and unmatched sides is the direct control over nearly any unit availible on the battlefield, ranging from your vulnerable yet versatile infantrymen to a mighty King Tiger tank. Direct Control, by the way, is especially thrilling when used while commanding a tank or some other land vehicle. This slightly changes the game from an RTS to a shoot'em'up action (might sound like a joke, but it's not). The in-game physics, even to this day, are awesome. Tanks explode, with turrets and armor bits flying everywhere. Structures, along with landscape, are completely destructable. This was also the case with Men of War's predecessor, which i have wrote earlier in this review. The atmosphere of the game is highly detailed and authenthic, regarless of the oudated graphics. The audio in the game is of very good quality, including both the original soundtrack and the sound files themselves. Machine guns rattle, explosions dominate the battlefield, soldiers scream in the heat of the battle, and all of this is accompanied by a decent amount of good generic soundtracks. The game has three campaigns, German, Allied and Soviet one, which are all split up into three mini-campaigns. Battles range from small firefights and even covert, commando operations to massive battles (an especially good example of a mission with a massive battle is  the last German mission which involves a huge armoured full scale assault on an allied occupied town )Another part of the game which made FoW unique is it's multiplayer. Unfortunately, since Gamespy has been shut down, playing this game on-line is now next to impossible... And as far as i have heard, even before GS ceased to provide it's services, practically nobody played this game on-line lately, prefering rather to play Assault Squad 2I recommend this game for it's sheer quality. Out of the downsides, i can outline only the oudated graphics, the lack of multiplayer(if your really want to play, you can hook up with some other guys and play a local game on Hamachi) and perhaps  my own subjective feeling of the game not possesing that *hollywood* image to it which is very often found in games these days. FoW is a good game which you play instead watching, and will bring you both a good challange and a fun time.			"

												10/10!!! #1 game in the world, in my opinion i prefer it more than any MoW game!!!!  I play it since 2007 but not that 1.04.1 sh@t version the original 1.01. and i probably have at least 500 hours gameplay(it maybe 1000+ idk :D)!! Really good strategy game what u can be use like a 3rd person shooter, a lot of weapons, looting system, lot of vehicle types and it allow you to get as much vehicle as you want in the game, awesome game controlling,good graphics,nice physics,no big bugs(i dont even remember if i find bugs in it) .Back in the days it had a great community, lot of people from lot of country it was really really enjoyable!. I really miss those days :'(  Back in those days i would say to you ""BUY IT ASAP MOTHA♥♥♥♥AAAA!!!!!!""But NOW...its different !!First of all, gamespy stop support FoW servers, so the game not even let you go in the multiplayer section.You just can use it in Lan with hamachi or tunngle or etc  After the MoW series , the FoW community became small, but you always find servers on it and you always enjoy when you play with it!Not just me and my friends think that FoW is way better than ANY! MoW game but a lot of old gamer who i talk with. Its maybe just because we grow up play with FoW, i dont really know but i dont even care at all.If i can go back to those days to play again FoW in multi,  i would do it. Miss those days...Good...Old....Faces of War(sorry for my bad english its not my native language, and if somebody want to play a little fow, just add me on steam!:) )			"

												Faces of War - is a sequel of the original game ""Soldiers: Heroes WWII"" ideas. The sequel, which improved and corrected a lot, and taken into account previous pluses and minuses. All the same, the first part of the series was the beginner’s exercise for the Best Way company. Yes, it was a breakthrough, the game set the tone. Faces of War  continuing success and proves that it was not accidental.For those, who have not played in ""Soldiers: Heroes WWII"",  I’ll say, that is a symbiosis of tactical RTS, wargame, third-person shooter and RPG. Although it is not certain that this definition accommodates the entire game. It has a lot of things more. You can steal a car, as in GTA, the only difference is that it is likely to be a tank or MLRS. There is also a reverse mode of construction. Normally, it is activated after the hijacking MLRS.There are three campaigns in the game: Germany, Allied troops and the Soviet. Each campaign has 5-6 maps, but it's such maps, bro, where are you (for three hours or more) attacking, retreating, stealing boats, tanks, occupying machine gun nests (not those, which makes machinegun eggs), picking on bellies  to the confrontation line, blowing up bridges, destroying whole villages and, hell, much much more. Plus, every campaign now has a tutorial that allows you to understand the basics of combat and game rules. Tutorial corresponds to the selected side and shows you all its advantages.Compared to ""Soldiers: Heroes WWII"", you start fighting with the allied forces from whom you can, if necessary, recomplete yours depleted squad. And these guys not just walking near your squad. Oh, no. They shoot, covering, they run away from grenades and sometimes gives the impression that deal with the tusk even without player. There are such AI in the game, that sometimes you just want to relax in chair and watch.A strong part of ""Soldiers: Heroes WWII"" was graphics. But everything is relative, right? ""Faces of War"" shows an unprecedented level of realism! Each exploded vehicle do not leave to the world of innocently killed machines, as we often see in games. She is lying, smoking and reminding past greatness. Exploded bridge does not disappear without a trace, as might be expected, does not join his killed steel friends. Oh no, he left a disfigured skeleton of mutilated concrete pillars with pieces of armatures sticking out. I can talk very long and flowery about Faces of War’s visual part. Collapsibility of objects is almost cinematic and absolute (in the sense you can destroy everything. Just E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G!). I remember the moment, when according to the plot i was given M4A3 Calliope, multiple launch rocket system. So, I was killed  for three times, until I calm down. Until i stopped just firing my sixty 114-mm rockets and turned the city into ruins, enjoying a wasteland created. And made a separate save to come back and perform this procedure a couple of times. And feel as the evil god of war, leaving only ashes and ruins.“Faces of war” is unprecedentedly realistic. And not only in graphics. Your every man in game is a full combat unit, which does not want to die, and differs from other units. Snipers, infantry and heavily armed commandos have different behaviors. The tank can not be driven and simultaneously shoot from all the guns, immersing into it just one soldier. Typically for such amusements we need about four, each of which has its own role.Listen friend, if you like the games about war, shooters, strategy, RPG, tactics, tactical strategy, just the games, to destroy, to blow up, to ride on a tank, to throw grenades and run away from grenades, hiding in the trenches, loot corpses, to shoot attacking, shoot retreating, shoot sitting, lying and on the run - play! Yet you say thank you!			"

												Well i got 20 hours of tough action from the first allied campaign and there are a total of 3 campaigns. Allies, German and Russian. So i guess there are 40+ more hours to go and i will want to play them all. This game is a perfect fix for my Silent Storm -type of game craving - without the bugs and crashes.  It's not turn based but since you can issue orders and pause the game at will then it does the trick. And i just dont ever get tired of the awesome vehicles - and toys that can be used to wreck the aforementioned. Nothing beats the feeling when a well positioned Tiger tank is souring everyones day and generally being an♥♥♥♥♥and then a 'volunteer' soldier takes a mad dash that would make Forest Gump proud to reach a defilade and toss that AT grenade on the back grill.Truly awesome example of a game in it's genre. Cons? not much - perhaps the fact that you are constantly scavenging the enviroment and bodies of ammo and precious grenades/AT-grenades/Bazooka ammo is a con as it can sometimes be a bit too much (Allies 'Omaha Beach mission' i am looking at you - who assaults a beach while carrying 0-1 grenades and just a few clips of ammo?). Handling artillery and mortars can sometimes be a pain. I also dont quite get it when a vehicle or turret is so damaged that you can't really use it. But that is offset pretty well by how awesome it is to man a AT-gun or a FLAK gun and start tearing up the place. 88mm guns are very scary to go against. Game difficulty is just right. Keep on outflanking when possible and going from cover to cover and you will get through missions well. Run around like rambo and you go down quickly.			"

												A very good game simillar to Men Of War.  I personally like the controlls that let you have the abillity to drive a truck or tank your squad is in.  The controlls also let you shoot/walk your man in a squad to a loctation, basically like a 3rd person shooter.  I really love the action in the game.  Great thing to play if your into RTS, stragety, and combat sims.  This game is a classic, and everything fit in like a puzzle.9/10			"

												Another men of war game that's not called men of war hah. It plays and looks exactly like the other games in the series. The game is pretty hard as you often only get to control 1 squad of soldiers without any vehicle support, this bumps the difficulty up and forces you go scavenge enemy equipment, but i like the challenge. The game also has some good mission variety and cool maps. It ran very well and i experienced no crashes. Overall I enjoyed playing it and would recommend it to any MOW or RTS fan!			"

												As a fan of the Men of War franchise, I thought this game might be worth trying, as it is made by the same who brought Men of War. I knew going into it that it would not be the same as Men of War, but similar. I thought the gameplay was just like the Men of War games, and I enjoyed it, being a bit challenging at times, like most Men of War games are. The controls, however, are a bit different than the traditional Men of War type, where now you must click different tabs for different unit commands, instead of having just one tab for all, which is a bit meticulous. This is my only complaint. I would recommend to anyone looking for a good RTS that has a few challenges. Good game.			"

												Having got most of the ""Men of War"" series already, I thought I'd start at the beginning - and check this predecessor to ""MoW"" out first. And yes, I like it.As long, that is, if I stick to multiplayer or my own created maps. The standard campaign missions are a total pisstake. As is quite often a feature in Russian made games the difficulty level ranges from extremely hard to totally and utterly impossible, so impossible in fact, that it would be easier to try to gobble one's own♥♥♥♥♥♥ (And we all know how impossible THAT is!) What is also common feature in Russian made games is anti-cheat elitism..... this is yet another game that has NO cheat codes AT ALL..... despite it SCREAMING out for them! Even internet prescribed direct editing of the game's hidden difficulty settings files (hidden in the game.pak file) has made NO difference whatsoever!Ever played the absolute godawful ""Commandos"" series of games? With their hair ripping-out gameplay style of:-1) Make one step2) Still alive? Then save!3) Make another step4) Dead? Then reload and try a different step.5) Still alive? Then save again!6) Goto 37) SCREAM IN FRUSTRATION!8) SMASH MONITOR!Edit: This overly profane difficulty does not appear quite so much in the later ""MoW"" series, the developers toned the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t down it seems! Probably as a result of a lot of criticism!Well most of the ""FoW"" campaign maps end up exactly the same! One of the many cheat websites at least had a savegame you could download that opened up all the campaign maps for you. This is the only way you will ever get the chance to at least try them all. But you will still never ever win 75% of them!Also typical of Russian made games is the utterly ABYSMAL English translations. Though I've seen worse, eg ""Cuban Missile Crisis"" and ""Blitzkrieg"". I often wonder how bad other languages have been translated in Russian made games!Edit: The developers also must have heard complaints about this too..... in the follow-on ""MoW"" series the translations are VASTLY improved!Despite the above issues, which are not the game's fault, but down to deliberately malicious map design and using Google Translate to do all non-Russian language texts, this game is wonderful! As I said, stick to multiplayer, or your own maps, ♥♥♥♥ the pre-made campaigns and you'll love this game!			"

Play long @ss tutorial for what seems like 3 god forsaken hours. As soon as I'm done it forces me to do another tank f0ck!ng tutorial. Finally after 3 long years, I complete it. Finally start first mission, kinda pumped. Entire team dies, only one left. Go Rambo. Kill like 50 Krauts with 1 anti tank grenade because the frag grenades are kinda pointless. Win mission by blowing up 3 vehicles and sniping little Nazi b!tches like it actually is 1945. All in an RTS kinda game, so do I recommend this game? I think yes.			"

												Very fun game. You can scavenge for supplies off dead bodies. You can snipe from far away. You can drive a tank. You can repair tanks. You can steal cannons from the enemy to use against them. The list goes on and on. You can control your soldier himself or you can control a squad. The missions are challenging and engaging which make them pretty fun. Now on to the bad stuff.Awkward controls (Easy to get used to)Some AI bugsCombat is much more fun using a single soldier.Too many buttons to press. (Your hotbar is filled)Like I said before. The missions are hard. Now some of them are a bit too hard. (More of an opinion)The game does not teach you everything you need to know. (Does teach most of it though)A few bugs here and there.8/10 I recommend buying men of war 2 assault squad. It is basically a much better version of this.			"

												Played missions on Tactics mode; Extremely challenging and unrelenting. Gameplay is awesome missions are set up at impossible odds forcing you to adapt and use tactics you wouldnt think of in any other RTS, you have to use enemies weapons to beat almost every mission and with only 4-6 of your own troops given; it is astonishingly hard. Pros to this game are all of the gameplay mechanics! Sound is great, units are balanced, Towns and cities are pretty well done. Cons: AI somtimes makes stupid decisions and run blindly at enemies and get slaughtered, you can technically counter this by putting them in return fire mode but it is a real hassal. Overall this game is great and is worth the money			"

												It's pretty challenging especially for those new to the franchise. You really need to focus more on your infantry than anything else because they are the most important units in the game. Tanks, SPGs and SPAAGs are more like commodities to make it easier to beat the levels but the hardest work is done by your infantry.			"

												where to start....Well first off theres the clunky controls, lack of forethought on the UI in general but i can understand a few things, then theres the fact that for at least 2 campaigns, you start off replaying the same tutorials, then theres the problem when everything goes wrong (which it will constantly do).Whenever you lose more than 2 troops in some missions, they become largely unwinnable, sometimes you can manage it, so long as the objectives are easy and you have good AI team mates assisting. Other times.... i spent 3 hours crawling around a trainstation, picking off constantly respawning enemies, only to die because for some reason, AI snipers can shoot further than you can.Would i recommend this game? only if you want to know what spending any amount of money on something clearly not worth it is.

												Where are the black people? The yellow people? The Mexicans? Where are the women? Where are the turban people? Where are the Jews? Why are there no Jews in this game? Faces of War is the most backwards game I’ve ever played! All the characters are WHITE MEN! What year was this? 2006!????? Where are the gnomes and the wheel chair people? They can drive tanks, too, you know! SO MUCH FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY!And where are the gays? I see no gay representation in this game. I look at the soldiers and I’m given no way to see if they’re gay and stuff. That’s SO ♥♥♥♥ED UP!In 1963 Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I have a dream” speech. This game came out in 2006. Faces of War is an insult to everything the Civil Rights protestors fought (and in many cases DIED) for! Faces of War is an insult to MLK Jr.’s dream! I bet the KKK helped design this game.Oh, and that’s not all: guess where ALL of this game takes place? Europe! There’s more to the world than EUROPE you know? Earth also includes: Africa, Antarctica, China, and America you know? Jesus.It’s not all bad, though. Just kidding. This game is evil. All it is is a celebration of white men. ♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Really fun game just has a few bugs in the game, but that just makes it even more challenging. The only thing I dislike about this game is fog of war, where you can’t see anything unless one of your units is in the area.  Over all, FOW is like MOW with German, America/British, and Russian campaigns that takes you through different story boards. Just make sure you try to hit the tanks on the side to kill them.			"

												Faces of War has been (and still is) a fun ride with a good ammount of difference from other World War II RTS games to make it enjoyable for nearly everyone. The game is unique in that instead of finding yourself in control of a large mass of troops and armor as you would in games like Company of Heroes you usually end up with one or two squads of infantry ranging from 4-8  troops at the beginning of missions. This focus on a smaller scale makes realistic additions such as scavanging enemy corpses for ammo or searching boxes feel okay and not too heavy of a burden. Each soldier has his own inventory, allowing him to store ammo, repair kits, or even other weapons if necessary. Additions like these help to increase immersion into the game and keep you on your toes, having to think more than about what to kill next.The physics engine of this game is neat, if you miss and hit the ground with a tank or artillery piece a crater will appear, and you can tear down most buildings and scenery by shooting and/or driving over it (I especially enjoy driving over sandbags and seeing each individual one fall and get out of place.) Helmets fly off the heads of soldiers as bullets wizz by, and everything has a sort of heafty feel of realism. The graphics aren't too shabby either for being almost nine years old now, similar to or better than Company of Heroes in most aspects.When it comes to the bad there are a few gripes, but not major compliants. There are times when you run out of ammo (or even fuel if in a vehicle) and you are left thinking there might be a bug for a while because you aren't shooting/moving without any indicator large indicator. The AI can be dumb at times, for instance if your troops are out of ammo they will stand around and let the enemy shoot them without taking new cover or running around to find new ammo. At some points you end up being left with large numbers of troops/vehicles and you may feel overwhelmed as the game is more suited to controlling small groups. The voice acting is subpar for the Germans/Russians as in both cases they usually speak with crisp American accents (I suppose this is more acceptable than a poorly done accent, but it feels out of place none the less.) Finally, each of the three campaigns include the same tutorial, which is unskipable even if you have completed it before.In the end you should buy this game if you like either strategy or the WWII setting, it's simply fun.

												Great game,  but there are a few big problems.  Firstly,  vehicles have a tendency to become unresponsive.  They'll be totally fine in terms of health,  and yet not be able to move.  Extremely annoying.  Sometimes troops become unresponsive too (my flammenwerfer was standing waiting to be shot last mission).  You can't capture all vehicles which is disappointing if you've eliminated the enemy and want to go for a drive.  Basically it's very fun but there are some annoying things.  And you have to exit by hitting ESC at the menu.  If you use their exit game button,  you will try and get back into it and Steam will say,  ""sorry,  it's already running"".			"

												3 Factions: Allies, Germany and Soviet Union. A total of 24 missions.You control soldiers with a limited inventory, the soldiers can take items and weapons from the dead or boxes in the field and can ride vehicles. You can take direct control of soldiers and vehicles and convert this in some kind of TPS. This will be particularly fun in the case of tanks and snipers.The number of soldiers for your mission is limited so don't count with limitless reinforcements as in other games.An excellent game at a very low price, buy it if you like MoW.I strongly reccomend you to play Men of War 1 before this, you can find Faces of War too frustrating if you dont have previous experience en MoW.

												Personally I really enjoyed battle of empires, then I found this which is a better game with the same basis and controls except it's more finely tuned, the voice acting is better, the wars are more dynamic and it has a wider range of vehicles, turrets and weapons because it takes place in ww2 instead of ww1 like battle of empires.  And anyway, for the low price of 5.49 it's pretty good for an RTS game with pretty advanced ai and each unit has its own inventory and magazines and med packs which you will have to loot corpses for if you need to. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tactical RTS games with use of cover and a wide array of controls for each individual unit (do not skip the tutorial)			"
