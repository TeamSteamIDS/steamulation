												This game was designed for SINGLE-CORE processors only. So, unless you have an old Pentium4 still up and running it's almost impossible to play this game for it will utilize only 1 core of your dual/quad/octacore processor. Theirfore it will take up to 5 minutes to process a turn. And remember...there are 1500 turns in this game. That's a lot of waiting!!!Great design and idea, but terrible programming.			"

												The game has interesting mechanics. They are not quick to learn as the interface isn't exactly friendly. The UI has its own logic. Once you realize what it is, it becomes easier to use. Yet, still not friendly at first.My main issue with the game is the considerable time between turns, becoming longer and longer quickly as the game progress, despite being above the recommanded specs. So, quickly, turns by the AI take ages.This problem is made worse by the limited number of actions you are going to make on each turn. Granted, it depends on nation played and what scenario, what are your objectives etc.Still, there will be turns where you have little to do. Or maybe even nothing because you have to build reserve before building, assembling armies before war, whatever before doing actions.So you can have two, three turns with limited or maybe no action but the time to process each turn still take longer and longer as the game progress.I'm used to Paradox games becoming over the campaign slower and slower with saving. Pride of Nations is, unfortunately, even worse and quickly worse when processing turns.I wanted to love the game, I believe there are goods ideas but the game engine is in the way. But spending much more time waiting for turns to be processed than actually playing... no... I regret but I can't recommend the game because of that.			"

												I've had this game for a long time, and have recently started playing it again. I still really like it. Yes, it is complicated, has a steep learning curve and takes some time to learn, unless you are familiar with AGEODs other fantastic strategy/simulation games. If you enjoy historical simulations/strategy games then you will enjoy playing this game, as long as you are prepared to learn how to play the game. The tutorials will teach you the basics, and there are some videos on Youtube that could also help you out.I find the game challenging and rewarding. I've clocked up over 140 hours and am happy to add another 140 to that. Other reviewers mention the game runs slowly and crashes often - I haven't encountered this problem to be honest, but yes, it does take a couple of minutes when you click 'end turn' but when you think of how much the computer needs to calculate and execute I find it understandable and don't mind the wait. The game did used to crash occasionally, however, since I have started playing again it has not crashed once in the 11.3 hours in the last couple of days. (Patch 1.04 has just been released recently and I believe this has addressed most of the instability problems).I'm glad I decided to re-install this gem and am enjoying playing it. I had been playing AGEODs Civil War 2 before getting back to this. CW2 is also great :)			"

												Not unlike other AGEOD games I've played in the past, the game mechanics for Pride of Nations look like they've got a lot of potential to be really good.  However, also not unlike other AGEOD games, the user interface of the game is not up to the task of the mechanics.  Lists of nations that you have to click to scroll down one at a time, clunky and variable scrolling speeds for a map (and you'll spend a lot of time scrolling across the map), a painfully limited messaging system (you have a new turn, here's 157 new messages....!  There's no filter, no way of focussing things).  It's playable, but it's the kind of game that you would literally need to have a notepad and paper next to you to play properly, because the game doesn't convey enough of the required information itself (or have a built-in system of reminders/overlays that is effective).  The diplomatic UI is particularly obtuse, for a game where (unlike many other AGEOD games) diplomacy is very important.The in-game tutorials are also very limited, and nowhere near up to scratch for a game of this type.  They repeatedly refer players back to the manual, but for a game that as far as I know was only released digitally, relying on a manual is a bit silly.  At the very least, make the manual text available in-game, and far more preferably available contextually in-game.If you can look past the UI to the game mechanics, it really does like like there's a potential gem here.  I haven't played enough of it to be able to rate the AI, but AGEOD games tend to be fairly strong on this front.  The mechanics look great, the attention to detail in set-up situations and a decent number (4-5) of extra scenarios as well as the grand campaign mean there's a substantial amount of game here, but the tools given to play the game are not up to scratch, and you'll have to persevere through them to get to the gameplay underneath.

												Pride of nations is conceptually very good and for the right people I can give it a solid recommendation. However I will start this review with the bad and some of the cons are quite big.-Graphics look like they are from 1995.  Not a huge problem, but honestly I expect even basic graphics to at least maintain the resolution of my screen and have writing not pixel out on counters.-Learning to play is terribly difficult. Interface is confusion and not self explanitory. Introduction tutotrial gives an overview of the buttons but none of the specifics, such as loading troops onto ships. It consists of a few text pages and some arrows which point to the wrong parts of the screen.  Game features a rule BOOK and you are better off reading that.-Turn times are long. Too long. The game is complex so there is a lot to be done. To further the problem there are parts of the game which the player will turn through quickly because there is nothing going on. I can get a lot done in the time it takes for a turn to go by-Poor player feedback. This goes back to the interface. But often it is not easy to get the information you need. For example if someone is offering you an alliance that requires attention. The notification is hidden in an event list filled with transactions. Or inorder to figure out the unemployment (important if creating new jobs) in an area you need to find the population then find and subtract workers from each local jobsite.  Often it is difficult to understand the implications of your actions without consulting the full details of the rules. And good luck if its diplomact which the manual gives no explaination on how the AI thinks.-Private capital is spent by the government or private projects. This kind breaks the emmusion a little because this is not how nations nfluence their economy.Now to the good.This is the single most detailed all inclusive game about the age of imperialism.  Every aspect of the 19th century is put into this game.  It is not clear or well explained but it all it there. I am a big board gamer and this sorta reminds me of one of my favorits Pax Brittanica. Therefore there is not way I cannot recommmend this to anyone who is interested in a deep strategy game.  The game is not too micromanagy once the poor interface is figured out.			"

												If were done technically better, that would be THE BEST STRATEGY GAME EVER. And yes, I played them all since 1985 :) Great concept, great freedom, great army building,Bad engineering, questionable user interface design. Still, I recommend it. And I beg Paradox to do a sequel, it will be a bomb if done with same care as HOI 4 is getting.			"

												This game has tremendous potential. Unfortunately the wait times between turns are long enough to make it totally unplayable. Even using a good computer five years after release, it takes about two minutes for the AI nations to process their turns. Each turn is two weeks. A grand campaign 70 years. That's ~1800 times I have to sit and wait for two minutes.Most turns the player does very little. The game very quickly turns into 30 seconds of playing, hit end turn, and then sit and stare for a few minutes. Not a good experience!			"

												Patience needed! If you can master your impatience, this game is as deep as the ocean (in PC game terms), very historical, very cerebral and very satisfying - if you are patient. The turns are slow, but you have to keep reminding yourself that this game in having to process an IMMENSE GLOBAL amount of information: remembering this will makew you more sympathetic and PATIENT! It's a tremendous game for history buffs like me who want to re-write history. The map and detail are rich, the management needs concentration. But if you are orepared to be PATIENT and invest the time, this game is immensely rewarding. No, honestly.			"

												I feel that majority of these negative Steam reviews are but lies and invalid. Firstly, scrolling around through all the menus and map is very smooth and the turn timer is extremely fast. I have no idea where these claims are coming from that the game runs slow or that it crashes. I've zero problems with the game, everything is accessible and easy to understand, the simulation of the 19th century is very well done. In the base game alone, you get multiple different historical scenario including a grand campaign to play as the major powers of the period and overall get an historical experience in the development of said nation. Guiding it through industrialization and also colonize unclaimed ""colonial"" regions rich with resources occupied by ""tribals"" as the imperialists would call them. The graphics, maps, unit icons, and music are top notch, everything looks beautiful and fitting. Overall, ingenious use of the different modes like colonial or military or economic make it easy to spot the industry of regions or military units. There is a lot of map filters to make things easiers for whatever you are looking for, overall if you spend some time with the game, everything is set bare on the table from the start and will be easy to grasp. I'm immensely enjoying the game thus far, and love the attention to historical detail. Definitely worth a playthrough, I highly recommend Pride of Nations.			"

												I read a few comments before I finally bought this game on special. Would not have bought it at the original price. I was pleasantly surprised when the game started.In some reviews people complained about being able to load the game. I had no problems and I am using Win 8.1 SL. The key is to leave enough time for the program to startup. It does take a while to load, but if you are patient enough, you will see there is no problem with the startup. Not on my system anyways ...Like the music, fits with the genre.Has a tutorial. Must work through it. Don't try to figure out everything for yourself, unless you like that kind of approach.Definitely worth buying on special or for a $10 price tag. More is maybe expecting a bit too much. "

												This is a very involved and complex game. When you hit the turn button, be prepared to wait a bit until it is your turn again. It takes time to generate the turns for the other nations. This doesn't bother me, but some players don't care for it. I usually keep my mobile phone handy and surf the web while I wait. When your turn comes round again, you get a list at the bottom of the screen you can scroll through that alerts you to what other nations have done as well as what your nation traded and took in via taxation. In a nutshell, you might think of this as a vastly superior version of Imperialism. Imperialism was a game from the 1990s that featured industry, trade, diplomacy, national resource development and a military component. You have military units, some with leaders. Your military requires you keep up supply lines for them. There are a lot of units. I have played Japan thus far and have found available what one would expect from an army of the 1850s in Japan but with some surprises like signals units, balloon observation and medical units. Players also have naval units available. Trade is pretty straightforward, as is the colonial aspect and the diplomacy. Research seems to be carried out without player intervention for the most part. There is a political component. Under the regional census tab, you can attempt to enact social reforms and laws. Under trade and commerce, you can enact trade policies which will effect inflation and wealth along with domestic contentment. You can also adjust taxation as it is broken down into income taxes, tarriffs, etc.The number of things that you can build in this game is amazing. From farms of all differing types of agriculture, to manufacturing, military and naval buildings, you can do quite a bit. Hovering over the structure, or improvement, tells you the number of days to build and components you need to do it. A turn is 15 days, so some structures take a while to come online. An area that will allow you to build a particular item lights up green, which makes thing move a bit faster.I would certainly recommend this game. There is a learning curve and the game features several tutorial modules that are very helpful. I recommend playing those. After the tutorial, I chose the nation of Japan to play because it is a smaller nation and I thought it would be easier to learn with versus trying to play Britain or France. There are also several scenarios included with the game and the developers have created others to go with it. The update tab on the starting screen takes you to the developer's website where you can purchase the other scenarios. My one and only gripe with this game is really a Steam problem. The game will randomly crash. From what I have found reading around forums on the internet, the game directly from the developers doesn't have this problem. For that reason, I cannot write a complete review on the game. I usually make it about three turns and it's gone. Luckily it saves and I can resume the next time I decide to play.			"

												Superb game but one must be patient, get up while the AI does its thing, and enjoy playing rather than being result-oriented. It is like being there. Great!One thing I don't understand is why not include Holland, Spain, and Portugal (as was done with Belgium) in the playable nations since they have colonies everywhere.I have found as I play that the game is biased in favor of the British and the Americans and very much against the Russians as if Russophobia has also reached the game world. That is a shame.			"

												I'd really like to play this game since most of the players that liked it prefer the same kinds of games that I do.  I find most titles in this genre (such as CK II) are totally dumbed-down.  It's games like these that I really want.  The problem with this game is no feedback and it is too slow.I just don't have the time. What somebody at Ageod needs to do is put together a real Lets Play.  Not that crappy little 5-minute job they have on You-Tube right now.  The only real Let's Play this game has is by some guy that doesn't talk.This looks like a great game.
