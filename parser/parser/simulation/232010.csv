												day three on the road. trucking is fantastic. it gives me time to think, time to reminisce and time to consider my future. just me, the road, and my truck. the three of us come together, dancing through europe, following each others' steps, without saying a word. neither the road nor the truck try to put me down, argue with me or lie to me. we understand each other, we co-operate, we accomplish. i have not felt so whole in all of my life.day seventeen. i've had some disagreements with both the truck and the road. we've had fallings out; it seems as though the feelings were not as mutual as i had hoped. 3 or 4 minor collisions in the last fortnight have put our relationship on the rocks. the truck hums its engine ignorantly, seemingly unaware of the perturbations it has inflicted while the road says nothing. the road feels a guilt it isn't willing to face. we move forward - scathed, but optimisticday thirty-two. i lost my job. i am driving home. the road is ignoring me. reversing in a truck is ♥♥♥♥ing hard			"

												Pros: -You simulate trucking across Europe- Much more efficient for lower end PC's- Fairly realistic in game mechanicsCons: - Doesn't have a 2 after it's nameOne may ask, ""Why the heck would I want a game simulating Trucking in Europe?"" and to that I must say, why the truck not. I mean unless you live in Europe and your profession is trucking, when is the next chance you'll truck across Europe?Another great question that may come to your head is, ""Why buy Euro Truck 1 when I can get the much more polished Euro Truck 2"" and to that I say, Why not both? You get the instant classic that is Euro Truck and its much needed sequel. And with most fans of the Euro Truck Series, I can assure you'll be anxiously waiting for the third installment of the Euro Truck series. If you aren't convinced to buy this instant classic for you and your family (who am I kidding you won't share) there is nothing else I can say to convince you!14/10 Keep on trucking friends			"

												Bought in a bundle, this is worth the buck or two spent especially if you have an older PC to play it on.  ETS1 was a great idea and has been improved with the release of ETS2.  Pros and cons of this game...Pros: Graphics not bad for its day and you can play a short run in 10-15 mins.  While getting in accidents, speeding, and running red lights gets you penalized, you can also play the jerk driver cutting other drivers off and hogging two lanes (which is almost a necessity if driving via keyboard).  Hint for new players--get your hazardous cargo cert ASAP so you can make more money faster.Cons: A careful study of the road map shows this game was unfinished.  Back roads all over Poland, a few in Germany, and none anywhere else.  When driving around, you see several overpasses that were likely intended to be used for backroads, but were left unconnected to anything.  There are also loads of no-go zones in the cities, where AI vehicles can drive, but you cannot.  Another minor complaint; the physics of the truck in a cloverleaf turn allow for too much drift and jackknifing the truck is easy to do, even at low speeds.  I have learned to go real slow through these.I am looking forward to playing ETS2, but if you have an older PC and/or a light wallet, you should give this game a whirl.			"

												I originally purchased this game around the time that the sequel - Euro Truck Simulator 2 - was getting rave reviews. So why not buy the sequel? Because it was priced ten times more and - reviews aside - it seemed doubtful I would enjoy a game where I tediously drove a truck down highways avoiding traffic hauling cargo. At least, I thought,  the first game would give me an idea if I could even stomach the genre. And if it did, well only then would I consider paying the price for the sequel.I was surprised out how engaging this game was. Perhaps because it stood in such stark contrast to all my other driving games (the Need For Speed series, Burnout Paradise, and similar), but there was something very relaxing  and enjoyable about driving between the lanes, making a point not to speed (much) and slam into other cars. It was almost zenlike. The graphics might not be particularly impressive but they got the point across, and the AI of the other cars was pleasantly non-aggressive. Figuring out the best routes to take and what cargos to deliver was not particularly challenging but it was relaxing, and a welcome change from the ordinary.Sadly, that's not enough to sustain the game, at least not for me. Having advanced three tiers and played over twenty hours, the lack of variety is increasingly noticeable. All the highways and cities more or less look the same and the challenge is flat throughout. So while it was a wonderful ride up to this point, it wasn't enough to keep me playing until the nominal ""end"" of the simulation. However, it /was/ enough to get me interested in the sequel, which apparently adds extra content and gameplay. And since that was the whole point of my playing this game in the first place, I consider it time and money well spent.			"

What is Euro Truck Simulator?Well to put it in perspective, it's more of a huge downgrade from Euro Truck Simulator 2. Although it maybe a downgrade for what Euro Truck Simulator 2 has, this is the first and older version of this game from SCS. These are also the makers of 18 Wheels Of Steel Series.What do you do?Well, in a nutshell you just drive, and deliver cargo to point A to point B to make cash. Is it the same as Euro Truck Simulator 2?Honestly, if you have a computer to run Euro Truck Simulator 2, you would be better off getting that, than rather this. Euro Truck Simulator is more a downgrade as it's dated at this time and age. It  was the first European based simulator for trucks. The map is less detailed, but not where it's terrible, it was good at it's time when it got released. There are no custimizations for your trucks, and less trucks to buy for yourself. The map size also is cut down compared to Euro Truck Simulator 2Is It Really Worth To Buy Then?I'm not saying this game IS bad, it's just very dated. It's really based on how you like your games. I got this game in the past because I used to play it when I was younger, including the previous titles that SCS have made. I was also unable to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 with my old laptop, but now I've upgraded and have not touched this game since.If you were like me in the past, having issues running Euro Truck Simulator 2 this could be a good alternative for you to get by. It has the key features to what Euro Truck Simulator 2 has, but it's just less detailed and minimal.For a rating scale 1-10, it's a solid 8/10For a direct link to ETS2, this link: If you want a Review based upon ETS2, Please feel free to read my other review: http://steamcommunity.com/id/coo400/recommended/227300 "

												I really like this game. While I don't have the best computer, and my trees literally look like cardboard cutouts, it's easy to overlook that because the gameplay is just so... relaxing. This is what I used to play GTA San Andreas for... The mindless trips down the highway and through the countryside. I really like the realism in some aspects of the game, for example, - When it rains I was pleasantly surprised I could use my windshield wipers to see better. - You have to sleep.- Your have to fill up your gas. You get fines for:    - Running red lights   - For speeding   - For not having your headlights on at night   - And for driving on the wrong side of the roadWhile there's no radio, you can add your own music which is kinda better, because I don't want to listen to hicksville music lol.It also works great with a controller, although you still need to use the keyboard for some functions, although maybe there's a way to configure them that I haven't discovered yet.Overall, this is simply really relaxing. I like how it isn't competative, and I can't wait to earn enough money to upgrade my truck. :D			"

												As a person who has been a flight simulator addict for going on three decades now...  ( I cut my teeth on a green screen IBM bootleg copy of Pilot trainer circa 1988 )  I have often been skeptical of the 'ground runners.'  Trains, racing cars and boats all have the same singular fundementle flaw on the virtual stage.  Primarily that no matter how much you REALLY want it to be true, you are NOT going to get a realistic perspective view of ... well ... ANYTHING.  Land and city scapes will always be a generic  reflection of what you just saw and are about to see again.  SO; having established my rational for skepticesm, what am I doing here?  To put it plainly.  I'm cheap and my entertainment budget can be bought.  In short for $20 I got the whole euro-truken-paint joben collection.  You should too, hopefully here is why....Pro # 1.It's Europe and there isn't a freken war going on.  Well okay...  Actually about 2 thirds of Europe.  Sans the Balkans half of Italy and 1/3 of Iberia.  If you like Scandanavia.  You are officially S.O.L.  Rather Ironic in fact, considering that no less than half of the riggs you use in this series are models made in either Sweden or Norway.  Back to the point.  See something of the great old country without having to shoot it, dog fight over it or deal with Hitler or Napoleon.# 2. Beautifully simple.  Elegantly addictive.  I honestly went into this game with little if any knowledge of truck driving and after 6 hours that passed by like 30 minutes, I not only know something about the actual life style, I can also add that it was fun doing something curiously different than trying to beat a bunch of crazies to a finish line.The one and only con I can come up with, is that the technology of it's day DOES let it down somewhat.  However; as I mentioned before I got the collection so I expect the second edition to be a bit more advanced.  Not only graphic wise but the over all control experience.  This first one is the best to learn on.  If you can get comfy with this one then you can graduate to more complicated challenges.Jim "

												I really enjoy this game, even though people may think it's boring to keep driving back and fourth to different cities to only drop off cargoes in order to gain more money. Although there is less cities to drive to, I still enjoy it. I love the feeling to be able to drive properly, and have played 20 hours within 2 days due to being obsessed. I'm not saying the game is perfect, hell, the second game might not even be perfect (can't buy it since I have a Mac) however it still is fun.I am quite big on graphics, and I have to admit this isn't so bad. The trucks/cars both look great and so does the interior of the trucks. You can either drive on manual or automatic which adds realism, and so does the various types of weather, time, and the rules of the road. Sound doesn't seem to be much of a problem, it has realistic car, weather, truck and engine noises.Having to deliver more and more in order to gain more money, does take a lot of time. But this leads to the game being more addictive and actually worth it. However, if driving back and forth for a while isn't really your thing, this can become a problem, though I ensure it wont be when you actually try it out, and even better, unlock more places.One thing that has annoyed me while driving around on here is how stupid the other drivers are. They either go the wrong way, beep at me when I am not doing anything wrong, and/or randomly brake when there was no need to which leads me into hitting them, which leads to me having to pay for hitting them. Adding pedestrians or animals would also be something which would make the game better (no I do not want to run them over)Another thing is how the cities are extremely small, and only have up to 5-6 roads, which is bad for when you want to explore other places other than the highway. The sound is good, but not so great. It sounds like I'm driving ontop of the truck rather than inside (might be because the windows are always open for some reason) and the radio does not sound like it's actually coming out of a radio in the truck.Honestly, I love this game even though it has some flaws which I have to live with, however those are probably fixed in ETS2. I recommend this game if you either have a older computer, have a Mac and cannot buy the second one (which is my case) or have a few cash left or is low on cash to spend it on this. An overall 6/10 from me.			"

												The old truck simulation game. If you want to see Spain, Portugal or Rome, buy this game. The graphics are okay. And even you can buy your first truck using the 100,000 Euros but you need to buy the C Class. The small amount of money of the truck is the Runner (Renault) C Class that cost about like almost 95 grand (95,000 euros).My disapointments of this game are:Only four different trucks. Swift (Scania), Runner, (Renault), Valiant (Volvo) and Majestic (Mecedes Benz).UK, France and Germany has only three citiesSpain and Italy has only two citiesPortugal, Poland, Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland has only one cityThis is the best truck game if you live in Spain, Portugal or Rome.

												SCS Software specialised in making truck simulations from its humble beginnings back in 1997 with Hard Truck. From then on in, it concentrated on the American theater with its successful 18 Wheels of Steel series. This game, Euro Truck Simulator is the first of its kind hauling cargo throughout Europe and whilst it has the same feel as its cousin 18 Wheels of Steel, the simulation experience is not quite there as it does feel a little arcade. And if it wasn't for the career objectives, I probably enter this game into an early retirement.The gameplay length is pretty much unlimited as there is no official ‘end’. You can literally go on forever however even the most dedicated truckie sim fan will eventually want to give up. However the game cleverly designed career progression chart, where you need to complete certain tasks to raise the ranks from being a novice to the master trucker. Five ranks in all and designed in a way to get the maximum usage for this game however it does take some considerable time to become the master. And because there are many feats (achievements) to earn, it provides you more reasons to play it so if it wasn't for those I'd probably give it a flick a lot sooner.Full review here - http://www.gamespot.com/euro-truck-simulator/user-reviews/2200-12543344/6 / 10			"

												The predecessor to the amazing Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game is pretty great in its own right.While it doesn't possess the graphical fidelity and scope that its younger brother has, Euro Truck Simulator 1 nevertheless features a detailed rendition of Europe and it's still a relaxing driving sim. It has some nice music as well, especially when accessing the game's map. The only real complaints I have about ETS1 involve the flawed physics engine; the engine itself can be fairly glitchy.I would recommend this game, especially if you can't afford ETS2 and still desire something similar. I'd also recommend it if you're interested in seeing how the series itself has progressed over the years.			"

												This game is pretty fun, very relaxing. The best way to play is to throw on a podcast or your own music and cruise around doing jobs. Some of the best features include how easy it is to run (I'm playing it on my laptop instead of my PC and it still runs nicely and looks decent), plenty of areas to work with, a fair variety of trucks, and lots of different things to ship around.However, many of the areas are locked behind pretty big prices, making it pretty difficult to expand beyond your few cities you have access to when you begin. As well, some of the well-paying jobs are locked behind inspections that are expensive.Overall, if you're looking for a pretty fun and relaxing game that you can pour some hours into then I'd say get it on sale. You will be investing a lot of time so keep that in mind. Oh, and a controller or steering wheel would make driving a much more enjoyable experience.			"

												you can use turn signal and hazard lights, TAKE THAT GTA. 10/10Seriously though, I bought this game on very low sale (first simulator game since Flight Simulator from 2002) and I am pleasantly surprised by the graphics quality. On High Graphics, it looks like somewhere between Arma 2 and Arma 3, if that helps. The HUD is great, controls are easy, missions are well-explained. ONLY complaint is the lack of music, but you can add your own, which I will def be doing. If you want a solid simulator, I recommend this.			"

												Within the first 5 minutes of playing a new game I got crashed into by a car and was charged a sum of money for apparently crashing into them, at the end of the trip. During the trip, I made a little pit-stop just to refuel my truck and the rest of the journey was bliss.Got to my destination delivering cheese.Dropped the trailer off....Only problem was: it took me at least 7 or 8 minutes to disconnect the trailer from the rear of my truck.Took another job, this time delivering yoghurts.Got crashed into again, this time by a fellow truck driver. I'm guessing people don't like the name on the side of my trailer. Either it's that or people just feel the need to crash into trucks.Eventually dropped the trailer off, and this occasion took me only about 30 seconds to disconnect the trailer.To be honest, about 6 months ago, I wouldn't have thought I'd be reviewing Euro Truck Simulator in a serious manner. But really, these first 45 minutes of gameplay have been pretty decent. There is a realism to the game and it truly reflects how badly British motorists drive. Let's just hope I don't come across a similar amount of bad motorists in France or Portugal.+ Hilarious and surprisingly not frustrating, even though I worry if a lot of the motorists have eyesight problems.+ The graphics are good for the time the game was produced, in my opinion.+ The game has a sense of realism (which I've previously mentioned).+ Engaging and a little atmospheric, too.- Being cut up and sideswiped all the time. Damned blind drivers...11/10			"

												Great game to play, very realistic. Unfortunately the game doesn't really have any story dynamic. The only objective you have is to make your way to different customers and transport their goods. The lack of story allows the game to get very dull very quickly. I needed to set a self goal for myself to fully upgrade every truck and unlock every neighboring country, then that would be the finale of the game. Regardless of the lack of story, the game itself is quite entertaining for the time it was made.			"

												This simulator is awesome!If you love simulator games and this goes on sale I would recommend this to you!One thing I do not like about this game is the fact that you have to save a lot of money to visit another country. This feature could've been done a little better...It's a little hard to get a large amount of money and everything in this game costs a lot; the values could've been a little nicer- BUT I DO LIKE THIS GAME!- The handling is nice, feels like a heavy long vehicle!- The cities look perfect- The Roads are well-built- The Graphics look good!I'd Recommend saving a little more and getting Euro Truck Simulator 2 as it is a lot better as you could guess...But if you are unsure if you like simulators or not and this is 75% off, this is a good test!..

However dont expect too much for a game which was realesed in 2008, obviously the technology wasnt as advanced today, this game is simple in a way which theres basically 3 objectives: 1. dont crash, 2. be efficient with your fuel and 3. get to your chosen destination with no problems. Overall its a great game and i do recommend this.			"

												If your looking at the Truck driving sim I will assume you already understand the basic idea..Its about making money, delivering loads incident free and buying better trucks etc.thats the idea..Its also about relaxing on a sunny day driving across Europe.. much cheaper than a real Euro vacation.Its allssooo about tight butt cheecks driving in low visability in crappy weather trying not to destroy your truck or kill anyone ( not really ) on your journey..  or dealing with city traffic in a big truck.There is alot to enjoy if this is your genre "

												Drive drive drive! All I can say really! Ity's one hell of a challenge to get the hang of your vehicles controls at the beginning. The stearing has to turn farther than most games to do a sharp turn and using a mouse and keyboard makes for inaccurate turning. I recommend if you wish to play this game to its fullest that you own a steering wheel for the PC or a controller so you can slowly eas in and out of turns.I recommend if you enjoy driving around but it really isn't much more then a truck driving simulator.

												Good and relaxing game to play although it lacks some major features of its great successor ETS 2. (i.e. real career mode) Nevertheless I like the idea of this game and I enjoy driving across Europe delivering the goods, almost feeling like a trucker myself.At the start of the game you choose your starting country and will be able to buy your own truck. You will then begin to make deliveries for the local industries to earn money which you can spend into upgrading your truck (like better fuel consumption) or buying trading agreements for additional countries as well as obtaining certificates for being egilible to transport specific wares.If you don't like games where nothing spectacular happens then this game is nothing for you. It's quite the opposite in fact and probably this is the major reason for me to like this game as it is something completly different than what I normally play.			"

												I had played Euro Truck Simulator 2 demo and really liked it. I then bought it about a month ago on sale. It was one of the best games I have ever payed money for on the computer. I was then looking at the Euro Truck Simulator 1 and decided to buy it because it was on sale for $2.50. This is also a great game. I am able to run it on high settings and not get lag. This was great considering any other game I run on high settings I am not able to play due to so much lag. If your computer can handed Euro Truck Simulator 2 on high settings then buy it. If not the buy Euro Truck Simulator 1.I have a Dell Inspiron N5050:intel i3 2.40GHz CPUWindows 7 64bit6 GB of ramIntel Intagaded HD 3000 graphics			"

												Note: Although I have little play time on Steam, it's because there's no Linux release, I've played this game plenty through WINE.ETS isn't as big, pretty, or complex as ETS2, but it's still good for a few hours of casual trucking. It also will run perfectly on low spec computers (much lower than recommended on the store page), so would be a perfect solution for getting your trucking fix on a laptop.Unfortunately there's no Linux release, but this game plays perfectly straight out of the box through WINE.If you haven't played ETS2 yet I'd highly recommend buying it before this. If you're looking through SCS' older work, I'd highly recommend giving UK Truck Simulator a go too.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator is a 2008 truck simulation game created by SCS Software, using OpenGL, set in Europe. The player can drive across a depiction of Europe, visiting its cities, picking up a variety of cargos, and delivering them. Over 300,000 copies of the game have been sold in Europe. Its followup, Euro Truck Simulator 2, was released in 2012.Players choose their starting country, from Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom (V1.2 & V1.3 only). Initially players only have access to their starting country, except if it contains less than three cities. In this case one or more adjacent countries will be accessible as well. For example, starting the game in Italy or Switzerland, you get connection to the other for free. Then, players choose their first truck with a budget of €100,000.After this, players can start taking jobs from various fictitious companies and delivering cargo to various cities in their starting country to earn money. This money can then be spent on a new truck, upgrading the current truck, expanding the business to other countries and obtaining a license to drive flammables and chemicals.			"

Then, players choose their first truck with a budget of €100,000.After this, players can start taking jobs from various fictitious companies and delivering cargo to various cities in their starting country to earn money. This money can then be spent on a new truck, upgrading the current truck, expanding the business to other countries and obtaining a license to drive flammables and chemicals.			"

												This game will make you feel like you are on the road for long stretches of time... watching the daylight and weather and scenery come and go, pulling out of truck stops in the middle of the night, and rolling into town as the sun is rising.There is a pretty serious time commitment here for such a simple game. Things like truck upgrades, unlocking new territories, and hazmat licenses are expensive relative to the amount you get paid for driving. You will be doing a lot of time-consuming long hauls to get a halfway decent truck and open up a few countries.My recommendation would be to load some music files or even audiobooks into the game folder so that you can listen to them through the truck radio, or at least have something going in real life while you play. Otherwise you might get bored before too long just sitting there forever keeping your truck in the lanes... since you're not actually getting paid for it and all. But if you can find a way to multitask it can be a relaxing and fun time.			"

												I'm going to be completly honest here: this is my first OWNED(and no I'm not a pirate) Truck Simulator Game.By the recommendation I like this game a lot! I even went out of my way to sell some of my items to buy the game!Pros:Good alternative to people who are poor and don't have a computer to run Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator. (Funny enough I have a GTX 1070 FE in my computer)This game still holds the basics of every Truck Simulator game! You go ahead and do a certain task and you have money to buy another truck.Has a decent selection of trucks (As far as I can tell).Cons:Pretty dated graphics (Even for 2008).Pretty dated in general.The map is not as detailed as the other two games.Conclusion:I recommend this game if you are short on money in your steam account and just want to enjoy a classic! Honestly if you haven't played a Euro Truck Game and you're not the type of person that has steam cards flooding then this is a great game to pick up!			"

												This is by no means your conventional ""good"" game. It features shoddy controls, irritating AI, eyesore textures, and a painfully bland rendition of Europe.Which makes it all the more frustrating how gratifying and addictive this game is. It doesn't add up. It shouldn't add up. But my God, this amalgamation of truckery engrains itself in your every being. Beware, and don't say I didn't warn you when you end up blowing all your real-life money on caffeine pills and truck stop breakfasts after playing this.			"

												Don't buy this game. At first it was a fun little Simulator game, but after my first time playing it things only went downhill. I first took off 1 shift at work, then another, then soon I had to start sucking ♥♥♥♥ to pay for my Euro Truck Simulator addiction. My wife left with the kids and I only just realized it after I went to the fridge and noticed I was out of pizza rolls, and mountain dew. Thankfully I pee in the 2liters I saved up so I still have drinks for a while. I turned my living room into a Euro Truck because I purchased a rig and placed it into my living room in order to immerse myself even more. But overall a pretty good game I would have to rate it an 8.5/10			"

												As a person/entity, having played the threesome of Euro Truck Simulator 1, Euro Truck Simulator 2, and American Truck Simulator, I can honestly say DO NOT buy this game. Instead, buy Euro Truck Simulator 2, or American Truck Simulator. Here are the places where the game shines, and when it flops in execution:Pros:- It is a good insight to where the series of Euro Truck was going.- Consists of Europe, which is quite large on its own.- A variety of trucks, almost similar to Euro Truck Simulator 2.- Cheap  - Easy to obtain the game- Easy to pick up, easy to put downCons:- Poor sound engine- Poor physics engine- Overall confusing option menu- No modding scene  - Lack of multiplayer (TruckersMP)  - Lack of proper Workshop support- Cheap  - You get what you pay for- No radio station connectivity, as seen in Euro Truck Simulator 2 and American Truck Simulator.If you are genuinely curious, try it. This review shouldn't stop you from wanting to try it. But I advise against it, due to ETS2 being $22 and ATS $20. There's already the bulk of Europe in ETS2, and the rest is available through DLC, which isn't wallet burning, and ATS is still being developed, which I find very interesting as time goes on. Personally, I bought this game out of morbid curiousity, due to not owning ETS2 myself. It became extremely awkward as there was no sound apart from the truck/lorry I was driving. I do only have 0.5 hours on this game, but that's all you really need to experience it. Any one is better suited buying ETS2 or ATS.Play it or don't, your choice.			"

												A great game to wind down and relax with once you get in the rut of things. Managing a giant trailer becomes second nature within the first few hours or so. Just gotta worry about fuel, sleep, and your destination, which is understandable if you forget, I did a bunch of times. A good option if your computer can't run Euro Truck Simulator 2, otherwise just get ETS2. No need to waste your time with the first.			"

In many ways it looks like a first draft of Euro Truck Simulator 2 which is a superior game in every way.			"

												This game is fun and a great starting point if you want to get into SCS's Truck sim games as its quite smaller than ETS2 and has a few less features to worry about, this game is very similar to ETS2 with a few differences, for example in ETS2 you have to save up or take a loan to get your first truck but in this one you are made to buy your very first truck straight away and the way you take jobs is set differently too.I have this game on my Tablet PC running a 1.66ghz atom processor and it runs smoothly with no visible issues, therefore it would be the better game to grab if you are wanting something with very low specifications for journeys on public transport or if you are a passenger on a road trip, there are a few flaws with the game but nothing thats too game breaking, if you have played ETS2 or even Scania truck driver simulator this game will feel outdated and primitive, however if you are looking to get into the series you cant go wrong with getting this game as part of the SCS deluxe package as you will get alot more value for your money.all in all this game has aged very well and even to this days standards looks like a very well made indie game however you will feel dissapointed if you come from one of the newer games in the series, i will not go as far as to label this game as a high quality game but it is for the most part a decent playable game that can keep you going for endless ammounts of playing as you strive to work for bigger jobs or better trucks.If you are looking for a highly detailed yet smoothly running truck simulator you cannot go wrong with this title, however if you want a more up to date feel with even better graphics, go for ETS2. if you cannot decide go for the deluxe bundle as you will get 5 titles and a whole bunch of DLC for ETS2.7/10			"

												ETS came before many other SCS Software trucking games, and it's getting pretty old, but the same main game mechanics you see in ETS2 are already here. If you can't play ETS2, find it too hard or find the time is going by too slow for you, try it.SCS Software's own graphics engine is greatly optimized and can make ETS run on potato computers (I first played with an Athlon II 260 CPU).Some of the possible drawbacks are the lack of a true GPS and ETS2's fame making it harder to find mods.

It's a nice way to just calm down after a tough day, because you don't have to have your full focus on it. This is really nice because you can do something else while you are playing without loosing anything from it.

												First off, if you want to play this game with the keyboard, you'll be disappointed. You need some kind of wheel for nice smooth turns, otherwilse curves will just be a bunch of corners. It's also difficult to drive a straight line. I am using a vintage UltraRacer PC handheld wheel and it works great.Graphics are very good, and the game doesn't miss a frame on my system:i7 6700 4GHznVidia GTX 960 using DirectX32GB RAM4K resolutionThe challenge of this game is having patience. You have to make quite a few runs to advance your certification and to expand into other countires. I don't mind this since I prefer games a bit more on the relaxing side.While realizing that most drivers are idiots, my only wish is for a little more realism on the part of the AI traffic. A car or truck will stop short in front of you for no apparent reason. Don't tailgate and you'll be ok.I recommend this game if you are into simulation. I must emphasize again though. DON'T buy this game if you have no intention of using a WHEEL. You'll only end up complaining and writing a negative review for a game that deserves better.			"

												This is an amazing game! My friend introduced it to me, and i cant stop playing it! The road trips are great, and the graphics are great! If I had one suggestion/complaint, it would be that the other cars never follow the rules alot of the road. Half the time i had an aciident, the other car had rammed into me. That would be my only complaint for this game. Overall, its an amzing game, and I'm very glad to have it!			"

												When I first came to Europe, I have quite a fear in driving around. Coming from a left side steering country and different sides of traffic along with the all new environment and different language, I don't feel really confident in driving in Europe. One day, I have to drive... So instead of driving an actual car and tried it on the road, I picked up this game. I drove in the Europe highway, coming and out of the different city, enjoying the scenery, listening to the local radio, bumping to the car next to me... After a while I got more confident. But does it help me with my actual driving on the road? Well of course not, instead I just rent a car and start driving even though it scares me. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my time in this simulator.

												I used to have a job as a trucker. I bought this game because I loved trucking so much and I wanted to be able to deliver cargo even when I wasn't on the job. After a while, I started to take fewer and fewer jobs delivering cargo IRL and started spending more time in Euro Truck Sim. Soon enough I quit my job altogether to play Euro Truck Sim all day. My wife divorced me, but who gives a ♥♥♥♥? You don't have a wife in the game so why would you need one in real life? This game is 1,000,000% more immersive and realistic than driving an actual truck, and I never want to do anything else with my life.			"

												Driving a truck in reverse is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done in my life.Well, what can I say? If you ever wanted to drive a truck across Europe, then this is for you. I mean, there's not much else to say, it's just like real life itself. Frustrating, annoying, boring, tiring, and what not. Then again, that's life for you, so this game is quite accurate when it comes to that.The experience is way better if you use your own music, you can drive around listening to Rick Astley, for example. That's something that can't be outdone.			"

												Like many games, the beggining is slow (still fun though), then it gets interesting, I enjoyed the idea that you have the WHOLE of Europe.I first bought ETS2, It was fun, but the lag was awful, so I completed my collection and bought ETS, now, ETS is more of a simulation, while ETS2 is more of a game, now, ETS has a nice selection of trucks, that allows you to fly around Europe, you get straight into the game but there is still a tutorial and some starter missions.The game is challenging, and has a flaw that annoys me, when you go into overhead view (press 3), you can only see in front of you, not behind you, like the tutorial suggests to you.But still a nice and great game.

												If you want the thrill of a real Euro truck simulator then this is the game for you!  I spoke to someone who drives trucks for a living across Europe and when he saw this game he could not believe just how realistic it is.The only things missing are the ability to pick up hookers, visiting the glory holes in trucker rest stops and any sense of entertainment or fun.The one thing that really struck me was how similar all the European countries look.  At least it will save me travelling in real life because now I have experienced first hand what it is like to drive from one continent to the next.  The biggest thrill is when you've carted enough apples and other commodities around to be able to upgrade to a better truck, like a red one.  Am seriously considering getting the sequel Euro Truck Simulator 2 now as there are often times when I can't sleep and I know it would help.			"

This game should only be played by 100% Grade A Red Meat Eating, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Hating, Americans!			"

												This game...This game is amazing. At first I thought, Can I get a game that can mimic the hard, boring life of Euro Trucker. And you know what? I bloody did. This game is the best game I've ever played. Fallout? God no. Fifa? Suck a ♥♥♥♥. Euro Truck Simulator brings the harshness of driving a truck straight to your computer screen. I mean who doesn't want to sit there, doing hardly anything and get paid for it! I recommend this game so much. The graphics are also amazing. I felt like I was carrying 12 Polish Immigrants irl.

												This game is very addictive, now you might be asking ""Random person on the internet, how the hell is trucking across europe addictive?"" It's becuase your able to explore, now this games map isn't like the crew and driving across one side to the other is a small 148 KM that lasts maybe 30 mins or 50 mins, this game map is huge, and I haven't even drove through most of it, but if a simple drive haul from Poland to Vienna takes maybe an hour or so depending if your low on fuel or you are too tired to go and and need to rest, this game is pretty big, another thing is that it's a simualtor, that means that this game is somewhat trying to be the real thing, so running red lights, hitting traffic, and (basicly trying to go as fast as the AI is) is bad, oh and if your still reading this look in the controls before you go and drive, so overall I reccomend it for people who have a computer too crappy to play Euro Truck Simualtor 2, or someone who needs a game they can play when they are bored, or someone who has 8$ and dosen't know what to buy, my general rating would be an 8/10.Fun fact, hitting C when moving enables Cruise Control.

												Euro Truck Simulator, is only but the best driving experience game you can play! The world is massive, I find my self playing for a few hours, end up getting tired and then sleeping for about 10 mins! This game is uber realistic! My only complaint would be there is no truck modifications you can buy like rockets or a spider drone! But from that, the territory you are in is realistic, the road and buildings are based upon real places. I would recommend this game to everybody!			"

Buy it when comes in a sale, but if possible buy the 2nd game as it is far more superior.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator is a fun / relaxing game where you drive a truck around. Expand your area of influence by purchasing rights to a country neighboring yours, and choose carefully between paying for upgrades for your truck or buying a new and better one. So why would I say such good things about it and give a ""NO""? Simple: Everything Euro Truck Simulator does, ETS2 does twice as well. And then ETS2 does a lot of things the original does not. Such as having an in-game radio allowing you to listen to Euro Truck Radio. Sure it's a bit more expensive, but well worth the price difference.			"

The game includes vast locations and great jobs to deliver cargo, wood, etc. The driving is flawless and you will need a lot of money to keep up in the game because once you are broke it's game over.

												In its time this was one of the best, if not THE best Truck Driving simulators. The genre in itself is very specific, so if you don't enjoy those types of games, this is not for you. You drive around in a Semi across Europe, delivering goods to companies and flashing out your company. Personally, I play this game to destress, as I really like driving in real life, and driving across Europe while listening to the radio helps me relax.I think the biggest gripe when buying this is the fact that ETS2 exists, this game's newer, prettier and in general better brother.

This is the most boring peice of crap I have ever purchased. It needs to be free to play even though it is so terrible anyway. Top speed of a truck? Guess. Oh you think you can modify it to go faster than a bugatti veyron? Nope, youve spent so much money running people over, dinging cars, and paying for gas that you dont have enough to buy a frickin fruit roll up.

												I downloaded this because it was on sale and, frankly, wanted to have at least one of these titles in my library for the pure comedic effect. If you want to do the same, don't do it with this version. Go for Euro Truck Simulator 2. In-fact, once Euro Truck Simulator 2 becomes, oh, seven years old or so, replace that recommendation with Euro Truck Simulator 3, or whatever nonsense they've added after ""Euro Truck Simulator"". These games incite cackles from friends, and a quick jaunt is fun enough, but, considering the appeal is already pretty low, you don't want to have outdated graphics on-top of it. And, if you haven't reached driving age yet, maybe just ignore my review altogether. I can see how this might be fun for someone that hasn't yet experienced the torture of sitting behind a wheel for hours-on-end.			"

												I have been play ATS for a while with my Logitech G2 controler and it works great.  However, with this game when I hit the breaks, it goes into reverse.  I did not like that at all.  Hit the gas and its auto shifts, which is fine but still to stop the truck from reversing you have to hit the gas.  Ok. that does not seem right and its completely unnatural to drive.  Please transfer the ATS control information into Euro Truck Simulator so I can give this a thumbs up.  Unless I missed a download.  Please let me know.  So far I like the game and really wanted to try it out.			"

												In my opinion, this isn't the best game. Unless you really like trucks, then it's the most amazing thing since sliced bread. Otherwise, I wouldn't suggest it.Here is what I think of it.The controls aren't greatIf you perfer the inside view and have it on low graphics you can't see anything when the sun is shining your wayIt's extremely hard to not crash into anybodyIt's pretty hard to control all togetherYou can hardly see what you need to on most of the camera views (ie, Red lights, other cars, ect)And In the one place you SHOULD see the important things (gas, speed ect) you can't. That being the inside view. I myself perfer to have a simulator feel like you are actually in the scenerio, this game being truck driving I'd imagine you would be inside the truck when driving it. Maybe it was just because I had low graphics on? I don't know.Sorry for going on a minor rant at the end but yes. Thats my review. What I'd rate it? 3/10. Isn't the worst I have seen but in my opinion, still pretty bad.			"

												Fun in theory, horrible to play in actuality. Impossibly bad controls, gravity-free physics (seriously, you tap the key to turn and your truck swerves violently across four lanes of traffic). I also couldn't get any music to play (that could've been an error of mine though, to be fair).It could be me, not being a PC gamer by default, but it seems you need at least three hands to operate fluidly. You need one for directional control, one for the mouse, and at least another hand for the wipers, horn, lights, gears, etc.I loved the idea, it seems like it SHOULD be one of those games that is relaxing to play, no real rush, quite pretty in its own way... but no. It's infuriating. The slightest twitch makes you lose your trailer, or gain an offence.I overturned my trailer (which was detatched from my truck) at one point, paid out almost 1800 Euros for help, and despite my money going (leaving me with no money for petrol), my trailer remained on its side until I rammed it back up the right away (which of course gained me offenses etc).2 might be better. I might get the demo. Wouldn't bother with this one, though.			"

												Oh god! This game is sooooooooo boring! I'd rather call it a simulator of simulator. Want to buy/play it? Consider those:Pros:- you drive a truck - which is not as easy as it seems - although all you have to understand is how to ride back.- the time of driving from one city to another is shortened (as the route too)Cons:- Boring! Nothing happens during the game except some small car axcidents (and do not expect them to be phisically real)- All the entertainment is to crash others on the road or listen to your-own-prepared radio (with OGG files)- You cannot use lots of buttons available in the track- No CB radio - come on!- You should stick to the law (speed, lights), but in the end you just pay the bills for not driving correctly. There's no police to hunt you down. Also no speed checks, and the speed is not corresponding to the law of the countries you drive through.-  Lack of customization for the trucks.- UI is so useless...Short: DON'T BUY IT!			"

												I'm really not sure how this got to be popular. The driving feels far too heavy to be enjoyable, even for a simulator, and there are so, so many bugs in the physics engine and the AI's control of their vehicles for me to avoid running out of money while transporting goods.The AI change lanes as fast as the cars on the freeways in GTA: San Andreas did - i.e. faster than your lumbering starter truck could ever hope to. They do so even when you are in the lane, which forces you to slam on the brakes lest you rear end them, leaving their car totally uninjured (i mean, really? we had destructable car models years and years ago) and immobile in the middle of the freeway. This often causes pileups as although your brakes are terrible, the AI's brakes are worse.The character model is horribly dated, even for 2008 - while your truck is quite a pretty piece of graphics, the character driving it has a grand total of three different animations - ""turn left, turn right, not turning"", and they jar horribly if you're viewing the vehicle from the front.It appears to be very, very quickly churned out by a junior company for a driving school, not a full fledged trucking game which I hoped.I heard the sequel is better.

												Really borning game without much content. It's driving from point A to point B. Hardly any traffic to deal with, no cops instead you just get fined once you do something wrong. Speeding tickets constantly if you get far enouhg ot buy a faster truck, also headlight violations when it's not even dark out. Also, no time limits on the shipments, makes getting fuel and getting rest pointless, you just stop by one on your way to the drop off point. Literally the only things you can do with money is Buy faster trucks, or buy countries so you can travel even longer.  The most exciting thing that happens is when it rains. Probably one of the worst simulators I've ever played			"

												Well programmed, does what it promises to do. There is a major flaw however: driving around virtual cargo is no fun at all. Added to that, the roads and the scenery hardly depict the real world. Short routes, unrealistic cities and bland graphics which are repeated at several sections in the game. Might be passable for young children, avoid if you are looking for a driving sim.			"

												I would recommend people to try the ETS2 Demo and or buy it. It is a better upgrade, this game the truck drifts around corners like it is on ice. You have to over correct the steering. It seems that the driver is 24/7 drunk. Fuel lowers after 2 km and finding a place to sleep after 15 minutes. I am just going too write this off as a 3 dollar loss.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator does not really cut it. ETS2 is very good, but it costs $30.Pros:1. OK graphics.Cons:1. Not much to do.2. The law-breaking detection system is terrible. You can sometimes get away with a few soft bumps on another vehicle. The speed limit detection is terrible. Once I got fined for going at 30KMP in a 40KMP speed area.3. Needs to be a bigger selection of cargo and some sort of drawback to transporting volatile goods.4. The ability to transport goods into another country is too expensive.			"

												I am really disappointed.Bartle's game referrence:Achieving: pretty much to deliver and achieves to obtain! 6/10.Exploring: once you see one - you'll see all. 3/10.Activity: no comparsion at all or any kind of competitors. 3/10.Socialising: next to no social interactions, only horn. 1/10.Bottomline: this game is great if you want to try such gameplay for the first time! Hurry when you want, buy country road passes and deliver loads of cargo on different slightly ugradeable (in vanilla) trucks!This game have a long life. But it is still laggy-buggy and, well, pretty boring due to low game mechanics in it.Pros: it runs on office notebooks, it can use steering wheel.Cons: grafic effects are worse than in russian truck game of 2002, gameplay is boring due to only one option - drive, no RPG elements, only very simple grind, no any half-hidden locations to explore or use. No easy way to see achieves... (culled) ...and even more: engine does not stop when you stops on gear.Lags: when I try turn head to look at mirrors this game becomes laggy. Much more laggy than PayDay2!Bugs: when I try to change settings in-game, the game fail textures, text, other output. But still works. And for the finish: in logs was found pretty awesome line:  ""syntax error in (/effect/eut/water/r2xx.atifs) at line 43 - token [,]"". Syntax error, Karl! It was still unfixed up to 22.11.2015 (day of this post).			"

												First time i've seen a game that gives me problems with vehicle steering. The steering controls do not work properly. They are defaultly disenabled. I constantly have to enabled them and even when i do enable them, it doesnt register. Even though they recommend a gamepad or steering wheel (i do have a gamepad - logitech, and ps 3 controller) i cant get my gamepad controls configured because there isnt even a keystroke command assigned to for ""steering left"" or ""steering right"" in the first place. So all i have done this past 0.5 hour is constantly restarting the game and moving the trucks forward and backward. Sometimes the steering would randomly work with just keyboard option.

												This is literally a boring ♥♥♥ game. I bought it because I was too cheap to buy truck simulator 2, which based on what I've seen has a lot more options like customization. This is just sitting and driving a truck and gets very boring very fast. I would recommend that you don't buy this game and you buy Euro Truck Sim 2 instead. You have been warned			"

												This game was successful in doing two things. First off, it made me realize how god damn difficult it is to park a trailer into a loading dock. You have to be a ♥♥♥♥ing rocket scientist to do that holy ♥♥♥♥. Secondly, it showed me that being a truck driver is quite possibly one of the most boring jobs in the world. If you're a truck driver, you should probably really reconsider your career choice.			"

I'm sure the game is fine and all over than older graphics, but for me the game was un playable.  Could not get my wheel to work, could not get 3 screens to work, for the those two things totally killed this game for me and I got a refund from steam shortly after.

												As a casual player who doesn't really play casual games, I can only think of a single reason to play such a game: The Scenery. But this game has none.  Everthing seems the just same. Details are poorer than driving games 10 years older than that. Different places are hardly distinuishable, cities are really sparse (ie, in Switzerland there is only Bern, in Italy just Rome and Milan), and when you visit them, they just look like small villages in the middle of nowhere. Perhaps that's what a truck driver sees, visiting only the industrial areas of citiies, but, even so, not once I experienced the magnificence of observing a really large city from a distance.Music is inexistent; still no radio stations available after 4 hours of playtime, so I had to open an external music player to listen to while driving. Controls are not satisfying either (quite clumpsy), but perhaps I'm using the wrong truck.To give you an idea about ""role playing"" part, I have to repeatedly drive between Bern and Rome about 15 times, just to unlock a new area, in the hope of seeing something barely different.From the trading aspect, there are no real choices: Just sort the missions and take the one that gives the most money. Taking short missions is not a clever choice imho, due to the time lost during long manuevers inside ""cities"".Besides the relatively prototype idea, nothing interesting.			"

												I love Euro Truck Simulator 2 its great buy that one instead. This is game feels like a Beta for ETS2. The steering is terrible. The towns are far apart and the the scenary in between towns is dull and boring. Also add to that no GPS, no auto parking the load and the diesel trucks that you drive around feel like toys. Its just not very much fun to play. Buy Euro Truck Simulator 2 and skip this one.			"

												I was looking forward to relaxing with Euro Truck Simulator. Switching off my brain and taking to the (digital) open road after a full day of work really appealed.Then I found out how clunky the controls were. Handling is terrible whether you're using a keyboard and mouse or a controller, and frankly there's no rescuing a driving game with bad controls. A beautiful open world can't make up for terrible handling, especially in a driving simulator.			"

I guess you might enjoy this game if you have some nostalgic connection to it, have never played computer games before and are exploring this mind blowing technology for the very first time, or you are playing on a toaster and it is not capable of running anything else. Otherwise, this game sucks. I got it as part of a bundle and have tried to get some kind of enjoyment out of it, but I just can't.			"

												Hearing about the wonders that the sequel to this game had, I wanted to see what the roots were. Having a outdated laptop that can't run much, the older game runs like gold on any computer of the recent 4 years or more. I experience some drops in frame rate here or there but not enough to say it is a problem.The game itself is quite simple. Drive from here to there. Pick your haul and your destination. It is a simple concept that can have you sink hours into the game. Since this was the first of its kind, there number of options is limited and few compared to the sequel. You can't make your own company, and there is no RPG style leveling system. You just haul to get enough cash to upgrade your rig.For what the game is, I adore it alot and plan to keep playing it. There is a steep curve in progress from your starting rig to a better one, but aside from that there is plenty of things to do. I can almost compare this to my time spent on Eve Online as a freighter for ore and other goods. I even play some Southern Rock on my ipod while I play this game. This is a game that you want to kill time with. Is ETS2 better? Well, of course it is a sequel. However, if you want a simpler version or you have a sub-par gaming computer, buy this. If you are up for a more complex and demanding game, buy the sequel.			"

Now Euro Truck Simulator 2 is way better, Serch them both up. I got this for $2.30 or so. GREAT DEAL. I would recamend this as it's so cheep, then move on to Euro Truck Sim 2 and have even more fun..

												Very well made game with very few frustrations, which is what I care about most. This is a game mostly for atmosphere and mechanics and less about action; this is a simulator. That being said, let me break this down into the jist of pros and cons.Pros:Nice extent of landscapeGood feel with controls, like shiftingAbility to insert personal musicExtensive language supportEnough attributes to keep from being too tediousCons:Dated/Minimal graphics (can be a pro for those with older comps)Oversimplification of some controls/aspects like loading, fueling, and weight distribution factorsOccasionally unweary AI (realistic?)Extremely minimal depictions of cities and monuments (often distant in skybox)I still highly recommend this game for anyone interested, for it's cheap and relatively easy to learn.

												It's not terrible, but it does lack the polish and refinement that a good game should have. Controllers are not turned on by default, and need tweaking to the settings to get working smoothly. The mini-map is awkward to follow with symbols regularly being obscured. The tutorial, for instance, instructs you to navigate to a symbol on the map which you won't be able to see, as it is hidden under another symbol. Warnings and dialog boxes are enormous and obscure your view, and menus can't be controlled with a controller or keyboard, only with the mouse. More importantly, the game-world lacks variety.Cheers to the developers for trying something out that is different and potentially quite enjoyable, but I wouldn't actually pay money for what feels like an unfinished ""concept"" game.

												This game would be an awesome game if all of this didn't happen.For one, no matter how I configure it in the settings, the sound refuses to work. It seems to occur in all old SCS Software games (including Bus Driver). After ignoring it, I play the game up until I complete the intro. Then, my truck has no trailer at a depot and I have no tasks. I can't find anything to start a mission. I've nothing to do. I Googled it, and couldn't find an answer. Until I ever find a solution to both problems, I don't recommend this game. Get Euro Truck Simulator 2, instead.			"

												It may be the older version, meaning it is fairly limited in terms of truck customization and map extensiveness (somewhat limited on total locations), but if you can get past that, its highly addictive, and for those who enjoy a good driving simulator, surprisingly good fun. The low price is also a very good selling point, giving you a pretty well-done, immersive game experience, more than you'd get from just the demo for Euro Truck Simulator 2. A good stepping stone to warm up for ETS2. Overall rating: 9/10, just wish the trucks could be customized a little more.			"
