												Now that I have reached 1,000 hours (or 42 Solid DAYS of time) played in Arma 2...I think I can honestly say that some of the best and funniest times of my life have been spent on this game since when my group and I all bought it in 2012. We were all brought to it by the stunning mod called ""DayZ"", but we found that Arma 2 was so much more then just DayZ. It turned out to be the most awesome and funnest military simulator ever. The thing that makes Arma what it is, is the endless creative freedom and community that bring us memories we will have forever. And I intend to make many more in the next thousand hours I spend on Arma.			"

ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead is best known for the popular zombie mod DayZ, which is a unique apocalyptic open-world experience.But what many of the players who bought the game only to try DayZ miss out on, is the vanilla game itself and the original experience when you join an organized clan or server to teamwork with other players during tactical missions. All servers use unique player-created missions.The missions are normally PvE, but PvP also exist to a lesser extent. Missions can range from being in an escort of military vehicles, rescue hostages, or attack/defend outposts. The game has a built-in mission editor that is easy to manage. ARMA II have plenty of realistic weapons, vehicles and characters. There are also hundreds of mods that increase the amount of everything.The game suits people who like sandbox, simulations and action games. However, it's not a very fast-paced game like the CoD or BF-series. In the ARMA-series, you might die unless the wound is treated. You have no visible healthbar and you require a map and GPS to know where you are.Useful links:Clans & Communities - Find a clan that fit you.Armaholic[www.armaholic.com] - One of many sites with plenty of usermade content.

												This game will always be embedded in my memory as one of my favorite games. Part of it is the game itself, but the majority of it is the community around it. The community I am specifically referring to is DayZAnarchy. The founder of DayZAnarchy, known as skunk, spent countless hours slaving away at his keyboard, scripting his server to be the best it could be. The work paid off, and I considered DayZAnarchy to be the best DayZ server there was. However, skunk passed away recently. No longer will DayZ be the same for me, or my friends. It makes me realize how much of his work I took for granted. I only knew him for a year, but I considered him a friend. If not for skunk, I would not love DayZ. Therefore, this is not only a review for DayZ, but a memorial for skunk.69/10 would f*** a pumpkin again. Rest in peace man.			"

												After playing this for a few years now and obtaining over 1000 hours on this game, I think it is time I reach my verdict on it. I believe that, though this game has its challenges, it is one of THE greatest games ever devised for the Personal Computer. I feel like simply doing a Pro/Con review because it's the easiest to format.ProsDEDICATED playing and modding community - even after being out for several years, many people, myself included still play this game religiously.Incredible mod support - There are literally thousands of mods for this game. Hundreds of new, GIANT maps. Thousands of guns. Thousands of new unit types. Even entire overhall mods to change it into the Vietnam war or World War 2. Mods exist to change every sound in the game and graphical mods exist to ease the strain on lower end PC's or make the game more beautiful than it already was.Already expansive game - The game, minus mod support, already contains hundreds of units, vehicles and guns in the case of Combined opsMaps - 15km by 15km maps, enough said. Maps contain multiple towns and villages, and often 1-3 large cities and/or settlements. There are also large area with beautiful landscapes such as rocky cliffs and washing oceans.  Some custom maps can be even bigger. But to put it into perspective, Skyrim's map is about 37 square kilometers, where as the default OA Takistan map is 164 square kilometers (About 12km by 12km corner to corner). Think about that one.Replayability - I do not mean the story when I talk about this, I talk about the virtually INFINITE ability to create scenarios in the editor. Want a tank battle 20v20? You got yourself a tank battle complete with terrain big enough to house it and FOBs for both sides. Want a small special ops team to assassinate a middle eastern dictator from 1.2 km away with a 50 cal? You got it. Want to fly an attack helicopter or CAS jet into the heat of battle? You get the idea. Infinite.Graphics - Though this is something that many people would argue with me about, Arma 2 came out in 2009. Even though it was released later, OA's graphics are no better because the game is still from 2009. It's the same engine and the same game, with a different setting. Given the circumstances, I do have a very nice rig, so the graphics look pretty to me. I constantly find myself looking off a cliff while preforming recon on an enemy position and thinking ""Wow, look at that view.""Realism - This may be a turn off point for many. I, for one, live for realistic games. I often b!tch to myself about other games not being realistic enough. This game, with the addition of a few mods, can be as close to real life as you want it to be. Mods to check out for added realism are ACE 2, Retexture mods for units to make them up to date and state of the art (Changing the US Army units to Multicam from that dreaded UCP camo comes to mind), and the Zeus AI mod.Multiplayer - 100 + player games. Nothing else to say.Now for the cons, these are all the problems that I've found with the game that personally annoy me.Lag/Desync - This is only an issue with larger servers, usually. It can be annoying but rarely 100% game breakingPoor Performance - This game is not very well optimized, and if you have a weak computer, you will struggle to run it with more than 10-15 FPS. Even if you have a good rig, it will usually only max out at about 35-50 FPS. Don't let this turn you off though, you really just get used to it.Ocasional hackers - This happens very infrequently, and it only happens on big servers.Expensive - For a game as old as it is, it is a bit pricy, I reccomend waiting until a Steam sale comes around to make a purchase in the Armaverse.Lack of Realism in Some Places - This is more of a pet peeve of mine rather than an actual flaw. It annoys me that all the US Army units use the SCAR L, considering it was rejected by the Army. The light version of the SCAR is just ugly to me, and when I can, I always mod it out of the Army. This will probably not bother 90% of people considering this game, but for those that enjoy absolute realism, check out the RH M4/M16 pack on Armaholic and it's respective replacement packs. STEEP Learning Curve - Patience is a virtue. You need patience for this game. A lot of it. You will die. A lot. And you'll die some more. Guess what still happens to me regularily. You guessed it. This game is a tactical simulator, if you try to play Call of Duty, you will be swiss cheese every time. The controls can be hard to learn, and I changed them right away so I was more comfortable. Modding the game is not reccomended unless you have experinece modding similar games. Though modding is very simple, things can be screwed up if you delete or put a file in the wrong place.Time Consuming - Processes in the game take a very long time. Firefights can be anywhere from a few seconds to 30+ minutes. The time it takes moving from place to place ranges widely. If you are on foot, expect about a 35-40 minute walk from one corner of a map to another. By plane or helicopter, you can travel long distances in minutes and seconds.Frusturating - It feels really bad when you're almost done with a mission or objective, and get killed.Overall this game is by far my most played and one of my most treasured games of all time. Very few games have the scope of Arma 2 and its many addons. PS: Arma 3 is much less realistic in terms of units and gameplay, but still has the giant maps and mod support. It does have better graphics, as well. I reccomend getting both if you can afford them.EDIT: MAKE SURE YOU BUY COMBINED OPERATIONS OR THE GAME WILL SUCK.			"

This review is for both Arma 2 & Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead combined. It is recommended to buy both games so you get all of the content and can join all the servers.Arma 2 is a realistic Military Simulator. Below I will review each aspect of the game.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The game has very enjoyable gameplay, with many different weapons and vehicles. You can do missions, play with the editor or play on multiplayer servers with many different game modes. Even if you aren't a fan of realism, this game can still be played casually.   Graphics and Optimisation The game is horribly optimised. Even people with top of the line PCs get around 20-40FPS at times. I personally have old hardware so cannot test the graphics properly, but at low they are still decent, but don't expect Arma 3 like graphics. The game gets extremely frustrating after a while due to the poor framerate. It should also be noted that the controls for this game are extremely uncomfortable to use, by that I mean it is unsatisfying and is the main problem I have with this game.   Additional Content The game features some additional DLC, however not owning the DLC is no problem at all, since the light versions allow players to gain all of the content from the DLC. However, the DLC content will be low resoloution, unless you buy the DLC. The game has no microtransactions. The game can be somewhat pay to win depending on the server, as some servers offer better weapons for premium players, but this isn't every server.   Value The game is worth the full price, as it is very enjoyable and you can get a large amount of hours out of it (for me it doesn't even get boring!). However, some people do not like the game. I recommend trying out the demo before buting the game. The game also goes on sale frequently, so it is worth waiting for that.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 9   Graphics & Optimisation 3   Additional Content 10   Value 7   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 8 Notes: This game is enjoyable both offline and online. It is one of the best military games I have played, but It is not to be confused with fast-paced action FPS games such as CoD. The 2 games are very different.			"

You can play civ, cop, terrorist, you can follow the law and mine for a living or do DRUGS :3 its up to you!I also played alot of wasteland, which is like a giant deathmatch on a massive map with vehicles and all, oh how many hours I have spent on independent camping the gun store xDMUCH RECCOMEND HIGHLY REPLAY VALUE 10 CAN OF BEANS / 10			"

												1000+ hours but didn't purchase this on Steam till after I was pretty much done with this game.This is probably my favorite game of all time. I never played a game more than this one and I will say why in this review.Back in 2011 or 2012 I remember being bored and looking for new games to play since I was new to PC gaming and always played on Consoles before this. I remember coming across a YouTube video about Arma 2 realism shooting. I thought it was interesting since I grew up playing Halo and COD when I was a kid. I seen this was something new so I thought to give it a go. I came for the realism but stayed when I noticed a server called ""Cherno life"". I had no idea what it was but it sounded interesting. --- My RP Experience ---I load into the server and I see there are Cops and Civilians. I learned that day what a online RP game was like back then. It was the funniest thing I have ever seen. People playing as Cops and chasing people who would rob a bank or gas station or commit murder. Even things like speeding got you pulled over. I never seen anything like it and I just loved it. I remember one day I got tired of some people playing as Cops just doing stupid things like killing civs for no reason and it annoyed me but I was in luck. I came across a video that had ""City Life RPG"" as the title. It was a mod and the very first I went and downloaded. It had things like sports cars and even ♥♥♥♥♥♥ 1979 Honda Civics in the game and if you couldn't afford that than I guess you could test your luck on stealing a car but the cops could find out and you could be put in jail and that isn't fun.There was just so much to do in that mod, you could grow drugs and run a business doing it. You could do the boring legal route to and sell olives which hardly made money but it wasn't illegal. Fishing and illegal fishing (shark hunting) was a thing and if you wanted to just be clean you could even become a cop which was hard as hell to do in this server. Robbing banks was even a choice but usually a stupid one unless you had snipers or were good at tricking the cops otherwise it wasn't worth it. It was pretty much GTA but with real people instead of A.II put at least 1000+ hours into that mod because it was so different and niche that it just appealed to me. I even met people on there who I still talk to today 5 years later. The mod just had one of the best communites ever and nothing comes close to it for me. Like I said in the beginning, I came for the realism side of the game but the RP side I accidently came across kept me playing it for a very long time.--- DayZ Mod ---When I started playing Arma 2, I remember there being 4 DayZ servers. They weren't that popular either but I tried it one day and I loved the idea and the game itself. It was something that has never been done back then. I remember this mod just blowing up and 4 servers became a 1000 in 2 months. Arma 2 went from a niche game with 4,000 people playing at most to one of the top PC games out there all thanks to this mod. Survival games have been changed forever because of the success of this mod that was made into a full standalone years later and is still one of the biggest Early Access titles in history. DayZ was fun with friends but after a few months of playing it and things like Overpoch, EPoch started coming out and all the hackers started joining it kind of going annoying. Combat logging was huge back then to which ruined the mod for me but in the beginning I think it was one of the best mods ever to release.--- Realism Mods ---Played some realism mods for a bit because that is what I was looking for in Arma 2 in the first place. Mods made it so fun to play and for awhile I enjoyed it. I did this for around 3 months and just got tired of the ego some people had. The community kind of ruined it for me but overall I still enjoyed it. Some of the best mods I have ever seen in a game like DayZ so this was nothing short of incredible.I said this before and I will say it again. My favorite game of all time. One of the best communites (in some mods, DayZ was pretty bad after awhile.) and the best mods I have ever seen created in any game. I would recommend this game in 2012 but not 2016. Its kind of dead these days because its such an old game. It might still be worth playing for DayZ mod though since this game goes on sell for as cheap as $2 sometimes. Otherwise just wait for a sell.Best game ever thanks to the modding community.			"

												It's okay for singleplayer, but a great game for multiplayer. I enjoyed playing 200+ hours into this game. Mainly the domination and wasteland missions. Graphics are good and very compatible with mods.""But you have 22 hours...""You could say I have 222. My CD key was actually stolen, but thanks to the amazing customer support at Bohemia Studios I was given a spare CD key for free as they were able to identify it was a CD key theft. This encouraged me to play the game even more and enjoy it. Thanks a bunch, Bohemia.			"

												Bought the Game for DayZ back in the DayS, still do not regret it. Early DayZ DayS where the best. Updates and new features made the game worse over time, so i quit at some point. PleaSe note that my gametime here is not even close to my actual spent time. Arma II itself - one hell of a good game, but sadly outdated. It's a very good military Sim and very fun to play with people you know. Other than that - not really worth buying anymore at this point. Thumbs up for the game, thumbs down if you want to buy it without being in a community which is actively playing it.			"

												Sincerely, one of the best games I've ever played.The base game and it's DLC are of sufficient depth as to keep you busy for quite a while.  The learning curve to master controls is a bit steep, but once you're proficient, you're set.If you want true milsim, there are plenty of mods and communities to support that.If you're into the whole post-apocalyptic undead-walking scenario, there's a little mod for that as well.In playing this game, I have had some of the most boring times and some of the most exciting times I've ever experienced, and I've had it go from boring to HOLYFXKK in mere seconds.I've fought for my life against great odds and come out on top, I've been shrekt by cheap AI, I've outsmarted entire groups of players (and had them compliment me by accusing me of scripting), and I've walked away from my keyboard while my character crawled a few km to a town so I could fix my broken leg.This game won't always reward you for playing it, but when it does, it's a true reward.

												Not just a combat simulation.... A fun simulation.....Seriously this game gives so much bang for your buck. The amount of hours you can sink into Arma2/OA are insane as there somethng for just about anyone here from the vehicles and weapons to the walking and the missions/operations. There are communities within the game that put on 40+ men operations that take hours and have an insane amount of detail and coordination. Just watch any of the shaktac community's videos and all the different perspectives you can see of a single operation. It's ♥♥♥♥ing awesome and however I myself have never gotten this close to what seems to be the true arma experience I have gotten a more toned down taste of it with several friends doing small missions that just give you this sense of scale and enjoyment you wont find in other games. Outside of its military simulation and the mods that further improve on that aspect you've got mods that have become something like garrys mod in there selection. To name a few; Takistan life, Wasteland, DayZ, Escape Chernarus, a hunger games type and many many more. Your options of play are endless and the mods are just as well done and provide just as much if not more than the base game. Hell Im sure a majority of people that have bought the game did so just to play DayZ. That itself spawned a stand alone game (That is and probably never will be on par with the mod). This game is the represent what it means to be a PC gamer. The experience and freedom you simply cannot get on console. But seriously there are so many key bindings and actions some arent even binded by default and you have to manually go in and find what else you need or want to bind. I've tried rebinding keys to make it more functional for me but I always end up missing a key or running out of keys in a comfortable area. The worst part is I cant tell if this is black mark on the game for being complicated or praise for its complexity and amount of input.... its just brilliant.			"

												Absolutely one of the most captivating games I've ever played. What feels like 30 minutes will actually be 3 hours. There's so much to do, it's never the same game for me. DayZ, Wasteland, deathmatches, there's no end to this game. I have some of the most memorable moments of gaming in this game.  I have recommended to my friends, bought it 3 times over, even had a friend build a PC just to be able to play this game. If open world survival games are your thing, I would get this 100%. Thanks Bohemia, for creating friendships, stories, YouTube videos, moments I'll never forget, and thanks Rocket for the DayZ Mod although you did a pretty awful job with Standalone.			"

A mind boggling vast amount of weaponry and kit to have too.Might not gleam and shine like Battlefield or Call of Duty but will put all other to shame in terms of having a truly satisfying military simulator experience.You will learn to VOIP or TeamSpeak. You will learn that Tourette's disease are for the weak. You will be patience. You will laugh at the ragers. You will spend an hour to kit your team and 10 minutes to complete the objectives.111/10 would buy again if I go back in time.			"

												Definitely one of the best simulator games this platform has to offer. Besides DayZ mod you can do so much more like Wasteland (base building and pvp gamemode), make custom missions, player made maps and playing around in the armory with your friends in an online server. Pretty good singleplayer, although I think the multiplayer with all it's gamemodes is where this game truly stands out. If you missed out on the hype and still want to play DayZ mod, I would highly recommend Overpoch by CCG. Either Taviana or Chernarus are both great maps for this mod. Taviana being the best in my opinion. + Gameplay and general feel+ More content than Arma 3 at the moment (e.g. weapons, vehicles, items)+ Operation Arrowhead DLC was free+ Custom maps made by modders (Taviana, Lingor, Namalsk, Sahrani, Panthera)+ DayZ Mod+ Comes with alot of default maps (like Takistan, Chernarus, Utes, Bystrica)+ Alot of different gamemodes+ Great fanbase and community- Graphics (depending on what settings you play on, but on overall high settings it becomes laggy in multiplayer)- Uses more CPU power rather than GPU- Clunky inventory system compared to ARMA 3- Vehicles drive like a cereal box- No weapon customizationThis game is in my opinion better than ARMA 3. Mainly being because of the timeset. I like the weapons better (M4's, AK's, DMR's) and there's alot more vehicles to choose from. ARMA 3 is a bit too futuristic for my taste, and the weapons in that game do not make any sense. Overall 10/10 and highly recommendable.			"

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an excellent expansion. It provides an abundance of new content and a beautiful new Central Asian setting, and a respectable number of new factions and armaments.  Arma II's single-player campaign achieves almost everything that an expansion should be.The thing to remember with the ARMA series is that it is more of a combat simulator rather than a simple shooter. To survive and proceed, the player has to learn tactics. Run and gun tactics of many games out there just will not work here. Tactics are the key to success in the mission objectives.This series still holds the crown as the best military simulators around.			"

												I ran up some stairs once and broke my legs and bled to death. My friend got his neck snapped by a tree because he went prone the wrong way near it. I drove a bike over a small bridge and it flipped over and crushed my spine. I drove a missle truck over a slightly larger bridge and it bounced up and down until it landed nose-first into a ditch and exploded the second I exit out of the rear left tire. I vaulted over some barbed wire and it teleported me under the map and I fell to my death. I combat carried my friend out of fire and he disappeared into the a black void where no light or cry for help escapes. I vaulted over a dam and got stuck under water. I rode a bicycle slowly over a bridge and made it safely to the other side where the rear wheel got stuck in the bridge and I got launched into the stratosphere when I got off. My friend landed a chinook on top of me and I survived until I climbed a ladder that teleported me to the ground instantly. I ejected out of a helicopter and survived the 230 meter drop because I landed on a 80° angle. I shot a bicycle with a tank and it didn't get damaged. I rode said tank over the bike and it flipped over while the bicycle remained standing. I unpacked a machine gun into the side of a building and could shoot out of it while no one could directly shoot at me. I got called an autist for not saying ""Copy"" and ""Over"" when talking in Independent faction chat. A hacker teleported everyone in vehicles into a hangar and they all exploded and the server crashed. I rode my UAZ off a ramp and the back wheels got stuck on it until they slipped off and the car exploded. I ran my armored car through a tree and took 0 damage to any parts and didn't get slowed at all, I then drove through a bush and took massive hull damage and the front tires were destroyed and was stopped instantly. I landed a helicopter near a bush once and it destroyed my rear rotor. I drove a tank at full speed over a small rock formation and it worked like a normal ramp, while an actual ramp damaged my turret and hull and brought me to a full stop. I planted a mine near a bridge and it didn't detonate when a tank drove over it, but when a civilian on a bicylce rode past it, it triggered. I wanted to be a cop in a roleplay server to abuse my power and they demanded I get on their teamspeak and do a job interview. I shot down an admin's jet on a wasteland server because he was carpet bombing every event area, he called me a hacker and banned me.			"

												I´ve spend 1.5k hours of my life on this game. Thats one of the best ways i can explain this game. ArmA 2 in only one word: Fun! Every time i think about ArmA 2, i remember the old DayZ days with my friends, and oh boy, i can tell you guys, DayZ Mod was the best time ive spend on steam. But i dont wanna talk about my memories, i wanna give you guys a serious review, so lets get started:Weapons: There is a big variety of weapons, and a lot of different options for every weapon, for example theres your ""vanilla"" m4, and then theres options with holo sights, grenade launchers, silencers and so on. Its not like in ArmA 3 where you can put the attachments on by yourself, but its still well made. Also, every weapon feels, sounds and looks different. The Weapons dont feel as realistic as ArmA 3 weapons do, but you still have to compensate for bullet drop, and the velocity of the bullet. Maps: There are many maps in ArmA 2, and they are all unique and well made. Theres definetly a lot to explore, and have fun on playing!Gamemodes: Well, this is kind of sad, but theres not really any other servers than DayZ nowadays. But lets be honest, i think the main reason people buy ArmA 2 is DayZ, just because its unbeatable by the SA.Movement: Well, the movement in ArmA 2 is not as complex as it is in ArmA 3. Of course you can lean, crounch, prone, walk and run. The movement system feels smooth, and is reliable.Overall: This game guys, let me tell ya, its one masterpiece of a game! Buy it, seriously, buy it! Its worth every penny, and for 15 euros its in my opinion the best game you can buy at this price point. And if you just want to test it out, and you dont think its worth 15 euros, then buy it on sale, you can get this game for 2 euros. Once you get into the game, you cannot stop playing it, trust me guys!			"

												Introduction:ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead is the standalone DLC (Downloadable Content) Pack for ArmA 2, A Military Simulator by Czech developer Bohemia Interactive. ArmA 2: OA is the only standalone DLC pack for ArmA 2. Multiple other DLC packs play part in Takistan, Including the BAF (British Armed Forces) DLC and PMC (Private Military Contractors) DLC.The Map(s):ArmA 2: OA is set in the fictional Middle-Eastern country of Takistan. Takistan has many towns, villages and cities to explore, with two airfields on either end of the map. The map of Zargabad, A Small desert city in the middle of nowhere, quite small compared to Chernarus or Takistan, but the city is hugh compared to Takistan's largest, Rasman. Zargabad also comes with an airfield and a few buildings here and there. the PMC and BAF DLCs use this map as well.The Gameplay:ArmA 2, as a military simulator has many aspects involved in succeeding. To me, and many others, the most important is Teamwork. You have to work as a team to get things done in this game, and I love that consept. It is very slow paced, very tactical, and aimed at people that don't like to get things done rambo-style. Movement is extremely fiddly with the inability to walk through clearly enterable spaces and breaking your legs on the oddest of places. The game is fairly old, however, coming in at a 2010 release, a year after the original ArmA 2.Graphics/Voice Acting:Graphics and Voice Acting are quite shameful, but the game is old and developed by a Czech developer making an english game, and the quality is tolerable.The Multiplayer:The ArmA Multiplayer is quite easily where the most fun is to be had. With excessive mods and gamemodes developed plus the original gamemodes implemented to play with your friends, i've spent 99% of my OA Experience on the Multiplayer. My most enjoyable moments on the multiplayer moments were on Takistan Life: Revolution servers. TLR, as it is abbreviated to, is a Roleplay Mission File for OA.My Issue(s):My only Issue with OA is the fact that when update 1.63 was released, it wiped out an extremely large fraction of all multiplayer servers. I took this as a sign of BI telling us to go to ArmA 3, which is quite rude. Luckily, servers are popping back up here and there, which is a very good sign.Summary:Overall, All ArmA games are amazing in my opinion, but ArmA 2: OA gets the cake. Congratulations to Bohemia Interactive for making such an enjoyable, but serious game and I hope this review was found helpful.Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10 / 4.5 out of 5.  "

												One of the best military simulators out there! if you are interested in realism to a degree, then this is the game for you! The game has good dlc but there are some bugs you will encounter, they arent to annoying but sometimes can give you a good laugh. Check it out if yo uwant to fly some jets , helis or just dfrive some cars and tanks. Really fun game and it also has a lot of mods that makes a lot more of gameplay to the game so you can keep enjoying the game in new ways.

												It was a drizzly day in the Chenarus. As usual, I was sitting in the woods, listening to the majestic sounds of nature, the birds chirping, the wind murmuring through the trees, as I waited to see other people. All of a sudden, ""POWPOWPOWPOW"". Instinctively I dropped down, and heard the sounds of bullets rushing past me, which sounded completely different than how Hollywood makes it sound. I judged the direction of where I was taking fire from. 40 ... 43 ... 45 ... 3 o clock! I saw a dark clad man jogging forwards holding a Russian PKM, which he probably found in a helicopter wreck. As I raised my gun, my M16A2 ACOG, I adjusted the scope to compensate for the bullet drop, and leaded my target.""POP! POP!"" I heard the scream of the man, and decided to slowly inch forwards. He wasn't done yet. 20 meters away, he suddenly opened fire. ""RATATATATA!"" He was injured. Instead of his shots hitting me, they went right into the ground, because he was forced to prone after his legs were broken. With one shot, I silenced him. Then, I took some food and ammo from his body, and went out to seek more targets.10/10			"

												Played about 100 hours, and still discovering the game. DLCs are expanding the adventure more and more, and DayZ mod makes the multiplayer gameplay still alive. Writing about how realistic is it would take a lot of time - just believe my words and if you are fan of modern, realistic warfare games you should get it immediately. Pure awesome and worth its price.			"

												If you like sandbox military simualtors you should def buy this game!1. You can setup and edit your own missions or whole campaigns with as much or as little detail as you want. It can be a lot of fun to make missions for friends and swap missions. I really enjoy building in depth detailed missions.2. I would not buy this game for the campain. This is not like a modern day skyrim. The AI can be very stupid. I call them situationally dumb troopers. The villagers do not do anything but stand there and die. There is no situational awareness for any NPCS. The villagers do not have a dialy/nighty life cycle. They stand 24.7 and do nothing interesting.It takes a long time to communicate critical details to your squad: such as GET DOWN your under fire. They often just stand there while you wail at your squads reaction to enemy fire.3. The mission editior is what makes this game worth it.YOU CAN build an awsome campaign/map/maps. 6.5/10			"

												Listen to me now. This game is unbelievably awesome. Most of these reviews - if you take care to read them, are from when the game first came out. It has come a long way - and so has the hardware to support it. Buy the game - even better if you buy combined ops - or buy ArmA II and Operation Arrowhead and combine them. It's not that expensive. Join a clan - a good one - one without ridiculous requirements to maintain membership. Play with the crew. Get to know them. And run some of the most immersive, realistic, expansive, open-ended, tactical, fun, glorious missions you have ever seen. ArmA vets laugh about CoD. We mock CoD. Because CoD doesn't have anything on ArmA. Seriously. Buy it and play it. Learn it. It's tough - we know. But good things come to those who wait - and put in the effort - to learn a real game. And if you can't figure it out - after just a few hours of applied effort - a look or two through the controls menu - and maybe even asking a question or two on multiplayer - then go away - we don't want you here anyway. Go back to your CoD where enemies throw themselves into your bullets and you are virtually invincible. We will be busy fighting serious **** enemies - human or AI - and trying not to get shot even once - because this game does not f*ck around.			"

												it ruined my life10/10More than 1k hours on this accoun, and at least 500 more combined on the beta version, off-steam and on my other account, it's one of the best games ever made.The core game is great, still competing with big titles after all these years of its release, but the mods made it even better. Be it ACE and realistic mods, be it DayZ and its variants, or basic Life/RPG mods, this game offers everything you'd want.Arma3/DayZSA Comparison:--------------------------------------------When compared to Arma3, it's barely worse. Both games are great, and got their own special feel. Arma3 is newest. so it'll keep having fresh content and an active community, and that's its main advantage over Arma2.-Buy this instead of DayZ Standalone, it is, and will forever be, better than that piece of crap. Other than SA being horrible, overpriced, and a complete lie, Arma2 has more to offer. It actually is playable, it actually has content and you can do endless things, not just glitch around and starve to death while eating.Plus, Arma 2 is almost always really cheap on steam, like $5 for the core game, the expansion and all DLCs			"

												I Dont know whats so addicting to this game but i found a gamemode on this called wasteland and i have not left the house since. I cant stop playing as bad at the game as i am, i find it so fun, i could play this game for hours and i plan on it. The gunplay is the most realistic ive ever seen the graphics are great, driving is mostly solid, and the map is huge and ive only been to a section of it. The wasteland mode is the best part of the game, where you scavenge for food, water, weapons. and you can build your base pretty much anywhere and its a great game to play with friends. there is a huge lineup of modes of transport. But now the main game, its a great realistic military shooter with accurate combat and many maps, modes and players.			"

												Despite not playing very often anymore, this game still has a thriving community (mostly in DayZ Mod servers) and is still very fun all around. It was the sole reason behind me making a Steam account, back when the original version of DayZ was gaining popularity. To this day, I still go back on to play with friends that I've met on DayZ or through Arma, or at the very least play recklessly on a Wasteland server, which requires no mods. Yes, the game can be very buggy, the community toxic more often than not, and ping issues may plague you, but this game has been the source for untold hours of fun, frustration, rewards, tense situations, and insane gameplay for so many people. I definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to access and explore a game with so many dynamic features and meet some awesome people; there is a well-grounded reason why this game has 14x more positive reviews than it does negative reviews.

												I LOVE this game. It's a tactical shooter/military simulator that has singleplayer, coop, and PvP. There are hundreds of vehicles, weapons, and player models for you to use, so each time you play, you try something new. However the game also has some parts that bring it down. I will list all the good/bad points.The good:Emphasis on realismEmphasis on multiplayerWide array of equipment, all usable in-gameSmall but active, mature and helpful communityGood graphicsGood atmosphereEasy to learn, difficult to masterLarge map, open world. Able to travel over entire countryGood inventory systemFun custom missionsReplayabilityThe bad:Bad voice acting. Every time you order people around, it feels like all the words are spliced. For example: ""team RED. go to that TANK""Clumsy infantry movement. While sprinting around for kilometers in open areas feels fine, moving around in buildings is slow, clumsy, and innefecient. You will notice that you either move too fast or slow for CQB, and that your gun won't fit through doors unless you're holding it down.Large amount of HDD space taken up. This game can take up around 15 gigs on your hard drive.No low-spec computer support. While you can turn graphics options down, you will find it hard to target enemies over 1 kilomenter away when everyone's texture is just a blur and there's a great big wall of fog right where they are.The engine. There are no ragdoll physics at all, object collision doesn't always work, shadows take up much processing powerAll in all, if you can get past the poor engine, you will find this game extremely addictive and fun. 8/10			"

												The Arma series has always held interest for me. It is one of the few shooters that has a learning curve. Playing smart, knowing your limits, and understanding tactics will give you the edge every time. I enjoy the large maps and the ability to play terrain. Its not a bunch of hallways and passages covered by an army of snipers. Vehicles and emplacements are powerful modifications and enhance the style of play. Everyone has a job to do and the team suffers if someone comes short. The DayZ mod is also enjoyable and employs some of the same tactics and skill with the ""zombie"" aspect. This is a great game and offers varied forms of play and there are a TON of mods available. It is worth getting Operation Arrowhead even if it is outdated. All of the Arma Games are a great option.

Prepare yourself for ARMA2: The Review: The Movie.Spring, 2011; early in my ARMA career, first tour of duty after a Steam Sale. I'm a fairly fresh recruit, seasoned with a couple dozen game-hours spent trudging through an expansive and swampy learning curve. Spent today at work, drove home, made dinner, cleaned up; it's Game-O'clock. Steam. ARMA2. Launch. Menu surfing, looking for multiplayer. Server browser hits my face with lists of information. -AWP-Warfare Capture the Island mode looks appealing tonight. Played it a couple times before, and I feel comfortable with the basics by now. Server connection established.Click! I'm in, filling the boots of a digital NATO badass. Apparently, international treaty organisations occasionally require the service of men with guns. Disturbing thought, but I'm no politician. I'm just a nobody with a rifle, taking orders that filter down the food chain. Those orders fill my mind now. Objective: town. Location: nearby...as the crow flies. Heh, the team's commander does have airborne technology unlocked, I just don't have the cash to buy a lift yet. Looks like I'm taking the scenic route. A quick check of my map tells me I'm at one of our hidden frontier bases and that there's two whole mountains between me and the nearby town. Great... I'll be taking the scenic route to the scenic route. The map tells me more: several of my team members and their A.I. controlled task forces are currently approaching the town. I'm already late for the party :(Might as well bring the fireworks.The base I'm at has only an armour factory and infantry barracks, but both will well suit my rapidly forming battle plan. I'm thinking heavy calibre fire support from high ground, overlooking the town. The topographic information in the map shows that the road I'll be taking is nestled around a minor hill as it approaches the town. Perfect. I'll park two BMPs there and they'll provide overwatch of the whole area while my comrades finish their capture of the town. An LAV will ferry me and one squad of A.I. infantry to the combat zone. I spend the required funds and set the plan in action.Wait a tick, BeatYourHeadIn, are you telling me you actually have to plan how you’re going to get your troops and equipment from point A to point B in ARMA2? Logistics in a game!? Yes, actual logistics...in a game with a map so FRIGGIN’ big you need to employ logistical planning skills to see any sort of success. And it's not boring!Back to the story. Formation of a military convoy. A few orders issued to my A.I. controlled task force later and the BMPs are on point while I lounge in the command chair of the LAV at the rear of the column. I man the turret-mounted automatic grenade launcher, a devastating weapon. Its barrel is ominously pointed at and tracking a lollygagging friendly player as my convoy departs base. Yeah, that's right chump, make one wrong move and I'll end you! Though itching to test the power of my new toy, I decide it's not worth getting banned over.  I let my teammate live, for now.The A.I. drivers of my convoy are as dim as a new moon, but I can fine tune my plans and keep up with current events while they drive. It's an 10 to 15 minute (realtime) drive that negotiates a winding mountain pass through an elegant evergreen forest. These are backroads, unpaved; enemy forces unlikely to be using this route. I feel secure enough that I spend most of the trip looking at the map, reading topography, lanes of fire, positions of friendlies. I smile when I realize I could probably minimize ARMA2 and play a few rounds of Counterstrike while my convoy travels.Dying immediately is certainly the last thing I'm worried about as I crest the peak of the second mountain.Suddenly: EXPLOSION..DEAFENING SOUND..FROM BEHIND..MASSIVE DETONATION..JESUS H. CHRIST WHERE IS THAT VOLUME KNOB! What is going on here!?My turret pans to the rear of the LAV. The sight, what a sight...I'll never forget. Fire. Wall. 60? 70 feet tall? A wall. Of fire. Taller than the trees in the forest, literally FILLS my view from left to right. There is nothing in view except the fire. I'm in awe. Confused. Shaken. I've seen 'splosions in this game before, BUT NEVER LIKE THAT! Did somebody tried to nuke me FFS!? I know there's no nukes in this game mode, so...Over the cacophany of destruction: the scream of jet engines. Very close. As the flames die down, a large shape traverses the air over the crest of the crag. Airframe, Sukhoi configuration. Enemy. Wing tilted down slightly; canopy visible. I know he's surveying the carnage below him. Hunting me. Cursing his aim when he sees the LAV still intact. I feel small, molecule small; what I just witnessed was caused by his war machine. Napalm bombs. Heavy ordinance. Whatever it was, it dealt complete destruction to that forest.Understand this, readers: in this game, air superiority is a literal phrase. Air is SUPERIOR in this game. This isn't your Battlefield ""oh look I can shoot a few rockets from my jet fighter and maybe kill one or two goofs on the ground and then reload (because reloading rockets on a flying jet makes a lot of sense) and kill a couple more goofs"" experience. No! In ARMA your aircraft can have a payload of more than a hundred devastating rockets and you can fire 'em full auto like a machine gun and destroy an entire town worth of goofs on the ground if you wanted to. Ha! Forget about balance! This is the real life Shiznit. Modern air forces don't invest heavily in war planes because they're ""balanced"". They invest in them because they can kill a hell of a lot of people quickly! ARMA2 knows this. Simply put, the developers have a big Bohemian boner for air power.But BeatYourHeadIn, what happened next? Tell us! Okay, I'll tell you. A miracle happened. My convoy survives the 'splosion to end all 'splosions. My battle plans go up in smoke like the forest around me. My current objective is to live through the next 30 seconds. The LAV is the only reason I'm still alive. It is damaged, but drivable. I order my drivers to haul♥♥♥♥♥in a forwardly direction. I track the Sukhoi as the convoy labours onward. The receding bogey performs a wide highspeed U-turn. He's heading straight for me again. Relentless much? He's the UPS guy we all wished was real: the one who comes back after he missed you the first time, instead of leaving a note telling you to pick up your package at the office near the airport!Then, from beyond the first mountain I had passed: a smoke trail racing skywards. Anti-aircraft missile! Ha! RETURN TO SENDER, A-HOLE! Two vectors intersect in a puff of smoke and light. Direct hit! Booyah! Wait, uh... he's still flying at me. HEY! HE'S STILL FLYING AT ME!With black smoke billowing out of his engines, this topgun is still determined to deliver my severance package. Frantically, I order the BMPs to target the limping jet. Cannon rounds arc through the sky in attempt to smite the airborne menace. Sukhoi Dude is getting closer, but he's losing altitude. Fast. He's now descending below my level on the mountain, looking up at me through the trees as he approaches. None of the BMP fire connects, but it doesn't matter. THIS GOOSE IS COOKED BOYS! Relief. Now, his desperation salvo of rocket fire is way off-target; falls harmlessly some distance away. I watch him frantically yaw right and nose up as his fighter loses the last of its life-sustaining lift and plummets in a sideways cartwheel into the trees. The inferno he leaves behind is a feast for the eyes. There was nothing left but a dark crater.Now, I can start thinking about that town again...What, are you apes gonna dig him a grave!? We got our own mission to die for! Forward march!All that's left to say is: play this game!			"

												I know what you are probably here for, DayZ or Island Life. Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead is a game for very serious, and mature gamers. This has gruesomley hard game types. It is very fun, with things such as DayZ and Island Life. Those are the ones that I have played, but I\'m sure there are plenty others. You must have a higher end PC to play this game. I reccomend this game to anyone who has a decent PC, and is ready to spend hours on end gathering things, just to lose them. I rate it 9/10.			"

												I bought this game years after it was released and still play it now. It is one of the largest-scale and team-oriented combat sims out there. The vehicle combat is sweet. You can coordinate with your ground allies via radio and provide air support from thousands of meters away in an Apache gunship. Classic game for fps fans.			"

												What can I say? It's the one and the only ArmA II: Operation Arrowhead, probably one of the most well known games amongst the PC gaming community. This game has everything for everyone. You want to stroll around in a zombie infested wasteland full of players trying to kill you instead of zombies? It's got that! You want to fly in a special ops raid on an insurgent filled town at night with the glow of green illuminating your room while tracers fly on the screen? It's got that! You want to play as an abusive cop and beat down the local civilian population for driving in the middle of the road? It has that too. Yes ArmA II:Operation Arrowhead has just about everything you could ask for, but it does have stuff you didn't ask for. Like AI's that are either blind of Vasili Zaitsev, Zombies that come through walls to get you, and other weird glitches that although are not game breaking, are annoying at the best of times. Whatever your fortay me be in video games, I am sure that Operation Arrowhead can fullfil many of your hopes and expectations from a now old, military simulator that is at the top of its respected genre of games. Whether you want to be a pilot, infantry soldier, tank operator, marksmen, civilian, rebel, or police officer this game can give you what you want. It is for these reasons and more that you will discover, that I recommend this game even so long after its initial release.			"

												What to say? 1200+ hours of fun spent in my legal copy of  this game, another few hundred hours in the editor and I still dont have enough. Vanila Gameplay is Really good single and multiplayer both, (multiplayer is significantly more fun) but once you install mods like ACE, TFAR (or ACRE) Blastcore, and JSRS you enter an completely new and mindblowingly awesome dimension of realistic gameplay. Yes the game is also buggy like hell, but the bugs are not gamebreaking and sometimes they are hilarious. And once you get familiar with the most common bugs they will stop bothering you, and you will be actually able to avoid them most of the time. "

												Pros:+ Awesome Gameplay+ Realism off the charts+ Massive open world+ Amazing Graphics and Audio Quality+ Awesome modding community!+ Level/Mission Editor+ Big Online CommunityCons:- Requires a decent computer to run on medium quality, a good gaming PC to run on ultra.- Loading times... zzz...- Some graphical issues on the rare occasion, easily dismissed (weird black stripe for half a second)Summary:Definately better than your traditional FPS shooters such as Battlefield and Call of Duty, but does require a fairly decent computer to run. My GTX 230 could run it on the lowest graphics for around 20fps, but frankly the game look horrid. Upon upgrading to two GTX 660 TI's and an octocore, Ultra graphics make the game look so damn beautiful. Game does need some optimisation from the developers so more variety of people of computers can enjoy and play with the vast community.9.5/10			"

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is a versatile game that has not only great developers, but also a fantastic community. For the most part, it's a (sorta) laggy, buggy game. But it's a laggy-buggy game that I love. Arma II rose to fame with the DayZ mod. DayZ is still thriving and in support today and makes an excellent addition.Pretty much just ignore this because I'm doing it for a badge. But really, Arma's great. Wasteland's fun.			"

												Getting older day by day, you may think Arma 2 is a game of the past. That is not the case, as it is still massively popular mainly thanks to the gargantuan number of mods that have benn made for it. If you purchase Arma 2, you are buying over 25 games in one. It's really hard to become bored, as there is always something new to play! However, due to it's age, the physics and graphics may be a tad annoying at times, but i seriously recommend it to anyone who loves a good simulator, and who also loves shooters!			"

												ArmA II (Armed Assault 2) is one of the best war simulation  games i've ever played (together with ArmA 3 and  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising).  The realism is   amazing *second only to ArmA 3), the massive open world nature of the game  and the different modes of play that are available, plus the   extra non essential  DLC that you can purchaseall add  depth to this superb game.  It's not  a Call of Duty, in yer face shooter, with  a linear   SP campaign, but a versatile, open   game with a mission editor  and loads of  free  custom made content that'll see you playing this game  for years to come. (I've played more than double the hours  that are quoted on my profile as I originally owned the  disc version of the game before I purchased it via Steam)  The environments you can explore in  ArmA II and expansions  are massive, covering  hundreds of square miles of  forest, country side, towns, villages and desert regions.  There's  masses of  weapon types, loads of vehicles and   airborne  planes and choppers that you can  play with and the online community  is  massive.  The game    is also   set up to use the track IR (a tracking device that allows you to look around  the games environment and frees up your hands  as you can lean around corners just by tilting your head instad of using  the Q & E keys, or you can look behind you , lean forwards and you zoom in on your enemy.  The hardware is expensive, but it gives an unparralelled   immersivness to the game.For me, ArmA II is  by far one of the best military simlation I've ever played (the only exception so far being ArmA 3).  If you like to  play a stealth game this is definitely the game for you; no run and gun, but a real military simultion.			"

												After years of playing Arma ever since Operation Flashpoint Cold War Crisis back in 2001, this game is great, It has quite alot of content and replayability value, but however after the release of Arma 3 Apex, this game seeems more and more like a distant past but a very good forefather to Arma 3. Alright lets get down to it. The game is very fun to play its another of Bohemia Interactive's Military Simulation, Open World, Free-Roam, Singleplayer, Coop, Multiplayer and you name it of what tags it can go under, It can go under just about any tags, depending on what mods you use really, The game is extremely moddable, thousands upon thousands of mods to this game, But there are things that displeased me alot about this game, Mainly the day and night cycle, Daytime is fine no problem, but the night time is horrible, you literlly cant see♥♥♥♥♥♥1 meter infront of you or in other words 3 feet. That was quite frustrating especially with DayZ, where you had no Night Vision Goggles. (HIV Confirmed). However thats not the worst, The Optimization in this game... can be a bit weird with certain computers, On mine it ran OK. But if i were to turn it up you got massive framerate loss compared to Arma 3, of course Arma 3 uses a updated Engine and so on. But this game really is a stinker when it comes to Optimization. Even though the Graphics are great for It's time. For People With Low End to Mid End Gaming Rigs: And you as you read this  wonder if this is worth your money since you have a low to mid-end gaming rig, well my suggestion is No. That is, because its really ironic, Arma 3 runs far better on lower end rigs than this game would ever do. You would get more Framerate in Arma 3 and of course would have a better experience with Completely new reworked physics, graphics and other game mechanics that runs very well on low end PC's compared to this game. But again. But On what I truly appreciate about this game. Takistan Life. HAHAHA, gotta be one of the most fun version of Life I've ever played, honestly. Despite the flaws in this game you can look past it, but Im on looking forwards, I probably wont return to Arma 2 ever again, but I will always have fond memories with friends in this game on all the stupid fun♥♥♥♥♥♥we did. And most of all the diverse setting of missions and quite a huge Coop Campaign, I think there were like 4 Campaigns and all of them are Coop Playable. What I would rate this game 9/10 a strong one too :)			"

												Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead is simply the best military simulator around. Graphics are still good, performance with current gen hardware is good.This game for me has zero cons, not even the bugs. For if you play this game for a long time, you'll get used to the bugs and you'll know how to play around them.Do you think this game isn't worth it anymore because of Arma 3? Well, I like Arma 2 more than 3. It feels way more natural, performance is better and weapons feel more realistic.If you are looking for realistic tactical shooter, no reason not to buy.If you are looking for fast paced fps, don't buy, for it's not fast paced and way more unforgiving than other shooters.

 Arma 2: Combined Operations REVIEW  Just so people don't get confused Combined Operations is Arma 2 + Arma 2 OA. Arma 2: CO is a fun military shooter while being realistic but not too realistic if you get what I mean.I can't say much about the campaigns as I have only gotten past the first mission on both Arma 2 and OA so I'll skip that section.The multiplayer is massive and can go upto nearly 100 players! (I've actually seen a server with a 200 player cap!) there is also a wide range of missions both default and user-made. However not all user-made missions are perfect and can have weird framerate drops, missing scripts and glitches. These missions range from generic deathmatches to total domination of the entire map with up to three factions brawling it out which is very fun if people ya know... Work TOGETHER. Which leads me to the community side of things.The community is rich with mods that add stuff like: armies from around the globe, weapons ranging from sci-fi sniper rifles to classic bolt-action rifles, maps of real world locations or comepletely made-up islands! There is so much modifications yyou just have to see it for yourself! The community is  most of the time  friendly and have loads of groups that play together with teamwork. Now here come the more dissapointing parts of the community. See you won't get much teamwork or friendlyness outside of these groups or clans. You WILL come across people who love to ruin the experience with people ranging from lowlife teamkillers (Sometimes its on accident) to hackers. You also get racists, random banners (Doesn't mean Battleye ban) etc. There is just a bad chunk of rot in the game so beware.You may also find it hard to actually PLAY ARMA 2! My goodness what ever you do if you want to PLAY ARMA 2 please for everything that is Arma USE THE FILTERS. The serverlist by default is spammed to absolute hell with DayZ. Which I consider a TOTALLY different community (They don't ""play"" Arma 2 they play DayZ).Now you may be thinking by most of the screenshots in the Community Hub  ""These graphics are terrible""  Well...1. The graphics most people set its LOW, LOW, LOW, OFF, OFF, OFF and LOW with a hint of 800x600. These people are A. People who struggle with the game's unoptimized performance or B. Have♥♥♥♥♥♥PCs that cost $400.2. The graphics are quite nice maxed out (Not that I can max them out ;_;) and if these are below your standards may I suggest you give it a shot.Now the fun part! Gameplay is... Fun? Is that the right word? I don't care I think it is fun to play, bit clunky at some parts but it is generally all good. The main focus is infantry combat which is nicely in-depth with range finding, sneaking about, misc buttons, etc. The game has A.I. companions that tell you to do♥♥♥♥♥♥but where it's really at is commanding them... Which is a interesting experience. The A.I. ISN'T the best I will tell you that right now! They can go through walls (Only really happens with LOTS of A.I.) They can't drive properly even if their life depended on it but there are mods that make the A.I. better. You also have the ability to use heaps of cars, trucks, bikes, planes, jets, APCs, jeeps, tanks and helicopters all with a little difference or a massive difference in speed, mobility and armour.Now before I wrap this up this game is VERY far from flawless and you will experience bugs and glitches that will only ever happen in Arma 2 depending on what is happening these can be downright annoying or pure hilariousness! These are the following examples of what we call being ""Arma'd""1. Death By PhysicsYou may be wondering  Wait other games can kill you by phsyics!  While you may be right but Arma 2's ""physics"" engine provides the most hilarious and interesting experience I've ever had in gaming.I've been killed by running into a non moving vehicle 3 times, I've had my legs broken or have been killed by rocks or similar objects more times then I can remember, I've been flung by vehicles further then the longest sniper shot and I've had my own vehicle flung into the air so high that it puts NASA to shame.

												I gotta say it's one of the best realism games, so detailed, but yet a bit buggy, i enjoy a few mods like the invasion 1944 mod, the voice acting needs to be fixed, like if you get wounded in battle, and try to call for a medic, the guy will say medic in a very boring way, like the guy who defines your words in the dictionary online.

												A marvellous, diverse, realistic and truly amazing game. So, why not recommend? One word: Battleye. Quite possibly the worst anti-cheat system I've ever seen in all my years of gaming and now that Steam has integrated with the servers, you may not even purchase new CD-keys for the same account. Thats right. Legally and legitimately bought CD-keys for this game have no use if you've already bought the game on Steam. Battleye has proven to be a stable as a house of cards, kicking people and denying them online play for nonsense such as ' Battleye failed to intialize ' and other such technical problems that plague the system which unfortunately was never perfected. It's a shame, because the game has a LOT to offer in terms of online and i'd personally jump to ARMA III if my computer could handle it but alas, I'm stuck in the single-player limbo of this game and confined the hacker friendly online servers. In short: Good game,♥♥♥♥♥♥devs ruining it with an unstable ' Anti-cheat ' nightmare system.			"

I've tried a bit of different survival horror games and i think i like this one overall. But its buggy, And the combat feels a little loose. I wish it was more tight and the zombies didn't glitch out when you're aiming at them...but the best out of them all.			"

 Get ready for a badass shooter! This will be semi quick, I've only been able to play about 30 - 45 minutes at a time before my latptop overheats (Will write an entirely new review later on, this is just to give a honest heads up on what to expect) so I don't know much about the scenarios quite yet or if they're worth playing but I can tell you that the bootcamp alone has me interested in playing as much as I can, I also learned this is NOT a fast paced shooter for the most part and is infact very strategic, I wouldn't know too much on how to handle the more commender-esque moments as I often played the ""freeplay mode"" and made a base asap for that UAV drone just to see what it's like up in the sky raining hellfire and let me tell you, the graphics for an older and non-AAA game shouldn't even compare to this game's as the locations are very well detailed and worth taking note of at times, I can't say I'm a fan of the land vehicle gameplay (HMV's and Tanks) but that's never been my cup of tea but I do like sitting back at 1000M and picking off pesky threats with a M24 while they spray violently and missing every shot along the way or taking out a small convoy with a unmanned drone, anyhow besides that not much is notable about the game as far as I can tell, the variety's fair regarding weapons/vehicles/etc (However without the original ArmA II you wont be able to use most of the normal gear or so on without paying a few extra bucks) and a fair amount of mods are out for this game that extends the realsm of this game by a ton.Imo this game is worthy of a Good rating on it's own, but as I mentioned earlier some of the variety of this game comes from the original ArmA II so if you plan to get this game then try to buy Combined operations.Combined operations (Original and Op:AH) 9.3/10Operation Arrowhead 8.5/10			"

												This game... buy this and Arma 2 and you have guaranteeed 1,000 hours of fun. There is so many stuff to do there once you get the hang of the game (Which is pretty hard).- DayZ mod which I've spent a lot of my time on and also many cool 'Submods' for dayZ such as Epoch, Overpoch.-The campaign.-Wasteland -Arma 2 life mod. RP-Editor to mess around or create actuall mission of your own with it.The game tends to have many glitches and bugs in some of the mods, but still is an amazing game.Arma 2 doesn't perform very well on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cpu's because it renders everything at the same time, it also doesn't have a very good optimization. You will need at least a i3 or fx 4300-6300 to play MOST of the MODS at a smooth framerate.  GPU won't matter a lot. Once you got like a 560-650 it won't make any difference when Upgrading. The only thing that will improve perormance in game is a new cpu and some config tweaks.Other than that the game is really fun, you will just have to trust me on that and see for yourself.			"

												Every second I've spent playing this game was worth it. Domination mode and DayZ mod will burn hundreds of hours of your time and you won't regret it. The engine takes quite a long time to get used to, and there are plenty of bugs, but the Arma 2 engine is unlike any other. There's something about the gameplay that is really fun and interesting once you're used to it. The DayZ mod is no doubt the best game you can play with your friends. The funniest moments I have ever had playing a video game took place in the DayZ mod. There's is so much freedom and endless possibilities for hilarious moments. There is nothing quite like how the anarchy works in DayZ mod.			"

												ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has got to be one of the most amazing first person shooters I have ever been able to get my hands on. It is an amazing expansion to the already amazing AMRA II. It has an amazing blend of story and action with different yet very well thought out controls. For left and right handed people. The wide variety of vehicles and weapons works so well with the settings in which the game is based in. I absolutly love the multiplayer! The high number of servers with hundreds of thousands of people playing on them even to this day! This is also backed up by the ground breaking DayZ mod which has an amazing blend of the classic multiplayer's firefight action and a high number of zombies out to get your brains!Pros:- High number of players still active- High number of servers- Amazing graphics- Wide variety of things to do and weapons/vehicles to use- Great storyline- Amazing equipmentCons:- Complicated controls for helicopters and planes- A few glitches in the multiplayerOverall, ARMA II: Operation Arrowhead has gained itself a well earned 10/10!

												Even with the releases of Arma III and DayZ standalone, Arma II still has a fantastic spectrum of options for ways to play the game, singleplayer or multiplayer. Until releases that make Arma II: OA completely obsolete, I would recommend it in the fullest.			"

												Bought this for the DayZ mod, and I wasn't disappointed...Very glitchy, poorly optimised, low frame rates in towns, random deaths, can sometimes glitch jump through walls, players using hacks, getting killed when you're a fresh spawn and have nothing, server donators/mods spawning with helis and AS50's, random leg breaks, random bugs which kick you out of flying helicopters, weapons disappearing when you switch them out from your backpack, zombies glitch hitting you through walls, getting stuck in vehicles, not being able to get in vehicles.All in all it's a fantastic game.But seriously, team-work based gameplay can be a-lot of fun, and the huge open world with no loading screens is great.Also don't listen to the minimum required specs, you could play this game on a machine built by Lord GabeN himself and it would still run like it's being played on a toaster.

												*Funny review*Tried a bit.''Serious''So,If you looking my review you obviusly know about ArmA serie or you are quite bit know about it.Lets begin with the gameplay.Gameplay isn't simple as you thinking every atmosphere will effect you''being shooted in leg,lung,near explosion etc etc''and these effect isnt effective out of battle.But when you in a firefight it will effect a lot.Like sprinting n running not works. Cus when you run your character tires and your aim is goes right left like real life.When you get suppressed your characters seeing is blurs.Etc.Lets talk about GEARS-WEPS-VEHICLESA bunch of weapon and A ♥♥♥♥ING BUNCH OF vehicle and gear in this game.Like real life you cant actually see at night without nv or flashlight.Silencer is more than minimap spotting especially at nights.Vehicles is an dimension.Like t34/t72/m1a1/m1a2 is only a little part about of it.Planes is specialized at helis.But not at jets(happens in all arma games nvm)Lets talk about modes.DM-TDM is normal modes.BUT there is 2 modes i really love and special for only arma.Cti a.k.a warfare.Whole real warfare.You can be commndr or soldier its fun and realistic af.Commander can build base,move hq,set waypoints,set missions etc.General approval/:Gameplay 8,7/10Graphics   7,9/10 Good for its time grapsAudio        6/10 Some weps got same soundsOverral     7,2/10Would die while doing HALO jumps in warfare.AND A NOTENever play alone or you will be bored.If you wanna play just add me.

												I have been playing the Arma Series for around two years; I can honestly say that it is my favourite series despite all the bugs and glitches. Arma has without a doubt one of the most active gaming communities that create endless amounts of content. Without these moders and script writers the franchise would have ended a long time ago. In steam alone I have 62 hrs played but out of steam using play with Six launcher and other launchers I probably have close to 1000 hrs played. Arma will disapoint at times when you get killed because you rolled into a tree but its worth it!. It can be slow but you can grow to love that, it's not for everyone but i highly recommend it even with the Release of Arma 3. It simply does not have the same feel or enough content to surpass the classic Arma 2.			"

												What do I have to say about Arma 2? Its great game and has so many things you can do, from fighting in the battlefield with your comrades to living a peaceful life as a civilian in the beautiful maps of Takistan, or Chernarus. But, don't mistake this for a simple sandbox FPS, It is far from it, I don't recommend this for people who are used to simple controls, unless you are willing to spend some time in the tutorial for a couple of hours. The campaigns with the DLCs and without them are amazing to play, except the one in the Army of the Czech Republic DLC. I personally give this game an 8/10 for great storyline in the campaign, the amazing modding capabilities in the game. The only faults I find are some bugs, the Army of the Czech republic dlc was disappointing since I couldn't really see the story behind it.			"

												Probably the best realistic shooter I have ever seen. Although the campaigns are not as good as in the original Operation Flashpoint, the gameplay was vastly improved, and the missions are quite good too, unlike like in any other ArmA (save for OFP). If you have never played this series, then you ought to download a demo and give it a try! Although the game is very unoptimized and controls are clunky, it is the best as war simulation ever went in video games. Good singleplayer (and mission editor), and great co-op multiplayer, which should give you at least dozens of hours of entertainment. PvP multiplayer isn't as good in my opinion, although it has its followers. "

												Best game ever, hands down. As long as you know atleast two friends who own this game.If you're gonna buy it, buy Combined Operations because both ArmA 2 and Operation Arrowhead are so cool and unique that you gotta have both of them.Very realistic military simulator but if you're playing on easy it can still be played like an action movie where an RPG takes down your tail rotor so you start crashing into a forest, everyone gets down and takes cover behind the chopper as your enemies converge on your position to make sure you're dead and an epic gun fight starts.The best aspect of this game is the scale and the amount of content. There's hundreds of vehicles, hundreds of weapons, hundreds of units, tons of maps, and like 10+ factions in total, all with their unique arsenals, vehicles, tactics and appearance. This game can either be played with a clan on huge scaled battles with medevac choppers on standby and armor swishing over the plains while getting carpet bombed by Warthogs or it can be played as a small rebel force, fighting either russians or americans or whatever you want, basically, hiding in the woods at night with only flashlights, waiting to ambush a convoy and steal their weapons and medical supplies.The best experience you can have in this game is with atleast 15 people because then you can experience the realism that this game is intended for and people don't have to multitask, such as one person being infantry and chopper pilot at the same time etc.This game is a solid 10/10 and most of the bugs in this game are managable and/or hillarious. Recommend using mods with this game, even if you don't like mods, some mods like ACE, you just can't live without.			"

Playing alone is kinda annoying and not that fun, but if you've a whole squad then it's awesome.

In fact, its not a shooter, its a simulator. If you want an easy ride into an arcade like experience, stay away. If you want a realistic simulator, go ahead, but i would recomend arma 3 instead, even though i didnt play it yet.

 ENGLISH VERSION This game is cool ! Why ?1.Takistan life - There you can be civilian , police man , soldier and terrorist ,but if you want to be terorist you need BIG squad , cars , and money.2. Wasteland - I dont like this mode , because there only PVP and have helicopters , tanks  and other.. (If anybody have it its bad )3. AND THE BEST !! DayZ Mod . There you can be ,,Hero'' and ,,Bandit''.You have ,,Humanity'',If you kill hero's your humanity will be low.There you have missions with bandits ( they are bots ) .The missions is HARD !!   BULGARIAN VERSION Тази игра е готина . Защо ? 1.Такистан лайф - Там можеш да си цивилен , полицай , войник и терорист , но ако искаш да си терорист трябва да имаш ГОЛЯМ отбор , коли и пари.2.Уейстленд - Аз не харесвам този мод на игра , защото има само ПВП и хеликоптери , танкове и още.. ( ако има някой в тях е лошо )3. И НАЙ – ЯКОТО !! Дейзи мод.Там можеш да си Хиро ( Герой ) и Бандит.Там имаш „Хуманити"", ако убиваш герои твоето хуманити ще бъде ниско.Там имаш мисии с бандити ( Те са ботове ) .Мисиите са ТРУДНИ !! "

												This is a review for the series in its totality. ARMA II and its expansions were a welcomed breath of fresh air to mainstream FPS/TPS games. Everything about this game is military ops to the letter. Real Time, Open world combat where one wrong step over a ridge can end you up flatlined. Tactical thinking is requierd in most situations on the campaigns, and sometimes even micro/macro management of your forces. Be aware that even though this game is kind of getting long in the whiskers, setting your visual settings to all high and max draw distance is not advised. The max draw distance of 10,000 (meters) will crunch even the best of Graphics card, and you will notice and performance drop. Every building in the game is descrutible (from what I have experienced). Also there are some bugs with ARMA II base game. They include, but are not limited to weapons/gear disappearing when exiting water, vehicles not spawning in when you buy them, AI getting vehicles stuck for no good reason or not properly moving to a waypoint, and in certain situtaions, losing command of certain purchased units, notably in your squad. Despite these flaws, ARMA II is still and fun and challenging series. And the multiplayer has loads of fun as well. Everything from testing weapons, to dropping a bomb on a group of civillians and watching them go sky high while your frames drop to the teens.			"

												This game is so addictive. It wasn't supposed to be, since it's a hardcore military shooter. But it is. Especially if you are playing the Wasteland mod, the graphics and engine are outdated, game is full of bugs, yet, it is one of the best games I've ever played, because of the gameplay. If you like being a rifleman, a heavy machinegunner, a tank gunner, a heli pilot (or gunner), a jet pilot/gunner, it doesn't matters, because it's war and you can be whatever you want. 10/10			"

												The most realistic war simulator game i ever play. It's great, probably my favorite game of all time..ARMA2OA it's a tactical shooter focused primarily on infantry combat, however it also features significant vehicular and aerial combat elements. The player is able to command AI squad members which adds a real-time strategy element to the game. This is further enhanced by introduction of the high command system, which allows the player to command multiple squads using the map.			"

If you're looking for a game to play with a group a friends but you would like to take a more serious angle on your playing experience I totally reccomend this game.			"

												I've owned this game for some years now and I tend to go back to it now and then. For me I really only bought this game for the Dayz Mod and kind of theft this game to rot in my library. I had never played the vanilla game and only used it to get to Dayz. However, when I did play it I couldn't get away from it. My 130 hours or so should explain that. Yes, most of that time I spent playing Takistan life with friends granted but other game modes were very interesting to say the least.  I never played the main campaign and don't tend to either, I believe this game is best when playing multiplayer; but only when you are with friends. Playing this game without a friend or two gets boring after a while, you can try and make new friends but if you're like me that isn't going to happen. Does anyone else love the glitches on this game ? I do, especially the ones on the Dayz mod where planes would bounce on the ground and you would die because of it, or when you try to vault into a blown up building only to break your leg. Loved it. The Dysnc! Oh god, if you want to be in the passenger seat and watch as the driver crashes into every tree in the game then this is the game for you to realise that it didn't actually happen? I like this game and always will do, but due to the lack of friends to play with and the fact I can't get the Dayz mod to work this game is some what dead to me now and will forever be a memory of the good times I had, an their were some good ones. 6.5/10. Why ? Because like I said before, its only fun when you're playing with friends and it gets quite repetitive after a while and very boring and stale fast,  and to many it is only a way to get to the Dayz mod which now for me is dead. Maybe if you were buying this is 2011-2013 then it would be great fun.   "

Get yourself a plot pole and build a base and be the king of Chernaraus. For only $25 I absolutely reccomend this game, and when you do get it you will regret you didnt have it sooner.			"

												ArmA 2 OA - Best Military Simulator yet! This game has everything, that is requires in reallife (including @ACE MODS).They're so many mods to fit this ""game"". I probaly have 1,000+ hours plus. (using a different client to run the game).Pros:Using the editor they're so many variables to use.Using realistic military weapons.The game has many Faction's. (RU, UK, US, PMC, etc)They're so many gamemods for this game. (DayZ,ACE/ACRE,CO-OP,IslandLife,Realism Unit, etc)Cons:I suggust they should add a underground system. When you crash the helicopter you automatically blow up which is not realistic, some just bash to the ground. It really depends how fast you going and how hurt the helicopter is.Better performance for low-performance users. Optimze the game better, god dammit!Overall. 11/10.			"

												One of the most fun games I've ever played, the mods are great, the custom missions are great, especially when you play with friends, sometimes you can be in the most intense, frightening battles you've ever had and sometimes you can have the funniest moments just messing around with your mates.The game can be a bit frustrating at times however, there are stupid bugs, the players can be very incompetent ( Obviously not a fault with the game, but it's still frustrating ) The combat is quite clunky and you can get stuck on walls and doors trying to fight in CQB engagements and the AI have incredible aim it's like they have an aimbot. But considering the price of this game and the amount of great moments I've had in it, it's definitely worth your money and time			"

												Turned out to be one of my all-time favorites. Operation Arrowhead patches so many bugs of the basic Arma II and essentially makes it a new game.While the game is still riddled with flaws, it is just awesome. A fantastic tool for tactical war-sim gameplay if you're so inclined and you bring a bit of brain matter into the equation.Grab your friends and roll in a tank, build up an outpost, dominate a crowd of kids in a plane or ditch the whole public domain, install ACE and ACRE, find a platoon and immerse in tactical infantry gameplay the way you did when you were still in boot camp many moons ago.Be a leet sniper and parachute into the action in hopes of quickscope headshots just to get mauled by enemy fire every two minutes or learn about the range of firearms and proper range estimation and use camouflage to your advantage as you work your way from one objective to the next under the cover of friendly surveillance.Shout into Voice-Over-Net because mommy doesn't understand you or join an ACRE server, learn about the use of radios and broadcast your grid reference to your platoon commander on VHF, over.The choices are yours to make once you realize that no two servers are the same and you don't actually have to play with toddlers.I will love this game forever and for always.

												My first experience with this game was designating targets for airstrikes by other players while a massive firefight happened around me. Since then, I've coordinated a mechanized infantry assault in Afghanistan, led a charge of Shermans into battle against Tiger tanks, conducted recon through the jungles of Vietnam, defused IEDs blocking the path for the rest of my platoon, and flown F-14s from aircraft carriers while my friend and I blast ""Danger Zone"".It's not the game for everyone, but it certainly is the game for me.

												ARMA II Operation Arrowhead is the very first expansion, and biggest for ARMA II, this can be played as a standalone game, and has a little more content than the original game. When DayZ first was released everyone was eye-ing this expansion as a way to install DayZ, since this was required. But people overlooked the quality of this standalone expansion. Taking place in a desert-like middle-eastern country, named Takistan, this is just a playground of destruction. With various gamemodes you can find yourself doing Co-op missions with friends, like flying helicopters, freeing hostages, clearing camps etc. Or you could do some full-scale massive gamemodes (Domination, Warfare, Deathmatch and Capture the island)This game is most definently must have, if you dig military sims, and are an owner of any of the other ARMA games.

												Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead/Combined Operations is a excellent military simulator that can be easily modded to fit the players' needs and can be a good Tactical Realism game when utilized to its fullest potential. Not a game recommended for players who expect aspects from Call of Duty, Medal of Honor, Battlefield, or other popular First-Person Shooters. In this Mil-Sim game, players are to think before they act; playing through the multiple scenarios in their head before executing their tactics. Communication is highly recommended since this game generally requires teamwork, collaboration, and team playing in order to accomplish missions. In addition, new players are highly recommended to play the ""Boot Camp"" scenarios in single-player mode until they feel confident enough to play on multiplayer servers. This includes, but not limited to Infantry Combat/Warfare, Controlling AI, *Flying Aircraft*, Driving Ground Vehicles, Understanding Logistics/Support, etc... The few flaws of this game are: 1) HACKERS & Team Killers. Indeed, hackers tend to lurk in multiplayer servers and to reduce the amount of gameplay from being ruined, join a server with an active admin. Team killers are an often occurance since new players do not identify targets before they shoot. 2) Poor AI. Although there are many mods that can fix this problem, the default AI behavior can be irritating for certain situations (e.g. piloting aircrafts, driving ground vehicles, infantry combat).3) Bugs/glitches. There are low chances that bugs/glitches may occur and can happen in the wrong place and wrong time. This is especially hazardous when you are flying an aircraft. Players tend to have to restart/reboot the entire game/computer to fix this problem.4) Lag and Frames Per Second issues. This common if you do not have a high-preformance computer, poor internet connection, or playing in a server hosted on the other side of the world (e.g. you live in the US but play on a server in the UK). Another common cause of lag is smoke and explosions. Smoke grenades, demolishing buildings, firing high volumes of Hydra rockets, explosions from artillery/mortars, and others can cause a significant decrease FPS which can reduce gameplay performance like player movement, camera panning, and others. Conclusion: Overall, this game is best Mil-Sim game avaiable to the public. *For the best Player Tips, Manuals, and Tactics, Google: Dslyecxi for entertaining videos on his YouTube channel, read/download his Arma Manuals from his website, or learn how to play like a professional.

												This game is so addictive. It wasn't supposed to be, since it's a hardcore military shooter. But it is. Especially if you are playing the Wasteland mod, the graphics and engine are outdated, game is full of bugs, yet, it is one of the best games I've ever played, because of the gameplay. If you like being a rifleman, a heavy machinegunner, a tank gunner, a heli pilot (or gunner), a jet pilot/gunner, it doesn't matters, because it's war and you can be whatever you want. 10/10			"

												Arma 2 OA amazing game i love this game not only for the mod dayz but also for the game itself it's a wonderful military simulator and i have played it for years. Like all good games it has some flaws only minor ones thow like it's HORIBLY optomized its still run fairly good but honestly it could have been much improved it optomization. i undoubtably recommend this game to anyone looking for a realalistic military simlulator :) ENJOY!

												This by far is one of my favorite games due to it's sheer replayability and large community, not to mention all the mods. If you're looking for a game to play with a group a friends but you would like to take a more serious angle on your playing experience I totally reccomend this game.			"

ARMA 2: Operation Arrowhead is most definitely worth the purchase even if it is just for the mods.Personally, i bought both OA and Arma 2 solely for the purpose of playing the DayZ mod. Though in recent weeks ive discovered that both OA and Arma 2 have even more to offer as an online game. The use of the ACE and ACRE mods opens up the online skirmishing to a whole new level of realism and combat, and the extensive community which consistently develops more and more modifications for both Operation Arrowhead and Arma 2, means that theres always something new and interesting either being added or updated.Even still, if you're not too interested in the online aspects of the Arma series; the Single Player aspects offer much too - and the detailed and expansive world which has been created for you to battle in is both vast and utterly brilliant.I would wholeheartedly recommend this game, and the base Arma 2 game, as a must have for your Steam Library.

												Well, to start things off let me say that when I first played this game I didn't expect to be so immersed in all of its features and complex systems and components that make this game a true milsim.  With so many mods from the community and so many scripts to make the game customizable I can't see when I'll stop playing this game series.  I've made so many nostaligic memories with my buddies and with myslef playing hours on end for the past 3 years, and quuite honestly I don't think I'll stop playing for a long time to come.  This game is worth every penny, trust me.  Private Gaming signing out.			"

												I got ArmA 2 outside of steam back in 2012 before the gamespy shut down and since I bought it back then I have thoroughly enjoyed it. In total I have amassed at least 5,000 hours of actual gameplay.I bought the game because I was at a friends house who had the original ArmA 2 from 2009 and when I seen the game I thought there was a lot of potential because of how it is open world.Almost everyday since I have had the game I've played around an hour a day but recently it has started to decline due to the game dying due to old age and useless updates for the DayZ mod.I think it is safe to say that this game is a fantastic game although it may have a bunch of bugs still in it, but the time has come for Operation Arrowhead. It is a 7 year old game in June and there hasn't been any real significant updates since the last corepatch in winter 2 years ago (or so I think). There has been no new dlc, only BattlEye Anti-Cheat updates to keep the hackers out.People need to understand that it might seem like a good game to buy now, but I encourage you to save your money for ArmA 3 if you don't have it, or, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds.I have been watching the population of this game recently and there has been a steady decrease of players. Just 2 months ago there was an average of 5,000 people concurrently playing, this number has now halved and I don't see it increasing again.It has been a good journey, but the road must come to an end.

												What a perfect game this is. Remember this review is MOSTLY opinion orriented. This is after playing many hours, both alone and with friends. I don't know where to begin. There is SO much stuff to do, with SO many mod spin-offs (Such as Origins, Epoch, OverPoch.) that it could easily have you playing over 5000+ hours if you are hardcore.Absolutely INSANE amount of players/content. It actually feels geniunely terrifying when you get into a firefight. This is NOT a running simulator, as long as you put the effort in, you could have a working vehicle within 15 minutes of your spawn. Also, helicopters.AI Missions, in case you get bored and need some extra loot. Very diificult to do, but the payoff is insane.Helicopters/Jets, depending on the server. Awesome.Tons of weapons, pretty easy to find one.Here's a big one: KOSing is NOT a major problem. Unlike H1Z1, you actually have a chance at making friends most of the time.No microtransactions. Everything's fair.Large maps, could take you up to an hour to drive through the whole thing if you taking the road the whole time.No persistent loot, so you cannot just server hop.Friendly people are everywhere.Our lord, Frankieonpcin1080p plays this game.Do I recommend this game? Hell yes, forget H1Z1, THIS is the best Zombie/Survival game to date.			"

												It's been about 2 months since my original review,  and in that time I've watched many servers die. I'm almost at 600 hours in Arma 2, and have been through a couple Milsim groups and several servers.To those wondering if you should buy this, and you stumble upon my review by chance, take a moment and read.Pros:-A great milsim game. A pistol can kill you just as effectively as any other gun in this game, just like you'd expect in real life. The fancy guns dont make the good players. If you take the time to practice, you can use a CZ-550 and take out a guy with a M107.-Good community. In the many servers I'm come across, I've been greeted by nothing but a great community. I've met some of my now great friends in DayZ, the murder simulator, and some great friends in Arma 2 Takistan Life.-Lots of vehicles. If you're used to Battlefield and how you get tanks jeeps and helicopters there, get ready for an ♥♥♥♥♥♥. There's several different tanks, multiple different cars, several helicopters and jets, all with different weapons on them. It takes a while to learn them, which is a sad downside.Cons:-Lag. Unless you have Google Fibre and a beast of a PC, this game will lag on highly populated servers and will be practically unplayable in the large cities of Takistan and Chernarus. I run this on a $300 laptop, with really bad internet, but I'm able to get about 20 fps. Just make sure to mess with your graphic settings so that way you can get optimal performance.			"

												***********************************************************************************************************Arma II: Operation ArrowheadArma II: Operation Arrowhead is one of the best expension I've ever played. It corrected what Arma II lacked i.e. the HUD in Arma II was a bit clumsy and could often get in the way when you played. all this was fixed in Arma II: Operation Arrowhead. HUD was not the only thing that is new in the expension, new armd cars, helicopters and guns are new.DayzThe main reason whay people bay Arma ll and Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is to play Dayz. Dayz is a mod to Arma ll. To play the mod you nead Arma ll and Arma:Operation Arrowhead. Most of may time in Arma ll:Operation Arrowhead is in the Dayz. You can play alone and whit your frends. the mod have some problems. The hit box can be wherd som tims and the cars often have problems driving over bridges.

												This game is wonderful, the infantry and vehicle combat is spectacular although the vehicles have some wonky physics but overall the game does what it does best, simulate combat in a realistic environment. The campaign was overall good and the online play is exceptionally good if you play with friends or even by yourself. Although if you are going to purchase this game I'd recommend buying all the DLC at once since the PMC DLC also has a very good story to it and adds cool vehicles and weapons.			"

												I don't know why it shows so few hours played, while in fact I have finished the campaign. It must be because I played it with some DLC on, or I don't know.I found Arma 2: Operation Arrowhead extremely intriguing and enthralling. You get into a lot of realistic scenarios and you end up managing things at different levels. I would recommend it to gun nuts and whoever has an interest in military operations.Nevertheless, it has its downsides: the learning curve is very steep, and frustrating at times. The game also tends to crash every now and then. On top of this, there are bugs and glitches, which force you to become paranoid about details, but well beyond what should be reasonably expected in a game.I will make some examples, so to ensure you are well aware of the issues with the Arma game system:- You are well into a mission until you realize some of your men have been left behind. Are they wounded? What happened? Simply this: you gave the ""everybody embark the vehicle"" command and yet some of them didn't manage to get in (not because of vehicle size, but because all the trajectories of NPCs are glitchy and buggy);- Driving vehicles is a pain in the ***. And I am talking cars and motorbikes... not airplanes and choppers. Controls are realistic beyond reasonableness: all vehicles' drift and reactions to gravity and the like are extremely realistic. Only difference is that I don't ""feel the wheel"" while I'm sitting at my desk... thus making the entire vehicle experience painful to no end;- Sometimes, a mission will not be completed simply because of a bug... thus runing ages of gameplay spent getting to a specific point in the map;- Endless menus to control everything friendly AI does... you have to use all your keyboard just to get somebody to do something decent like searching for an IEDOverall, it is a very nice game, but picking it up after maybe one year not playing it... and I am back to step 0: I have to re-learn all keyboard commands from scratch. So annoying.			"

												Arma 2 OA is one of if not the most relictice games of all time. it is hard to lern and fun to play.Gameplay:Gameplay is not esay and is not to be overlocked so if you like the army and are not afrad of dieding over and over and over then pick it up and it is a good game. and it is best in good detail everything feeles alive and is good when you kill someone so in that aspect it is rely good. Animations:Not good animations but far from the wost i'v seen so not much to talk abote here. Story:The story of Arma 2 OA is that the tacastan (do not know how to spell it) army has seized control of the contery. the US laed coaltion is to bring down the tacs and liberaty the contery. And the story is reliy well pulled out for a game like this.Verdict:Arma 2 OA Is a good game with good gameplay for the type of game it is and my finel verdict for Arma 2 OA is a 8.5			"

												Great game to chew up hours of free time. Play almost 100 hours and I will never regret those hours spent playing the  DayZ mod optional with the game, which I encourage you to try. Look up popularly known Youtube content creators like JackFrags, FRANKIEonPCin1080p (I know he had a couple of scandals regarding the hacking incidents, such a shame) and PsiSyndicate.Fantastic game DayZ is.Although a bit more expense required to play this game compared to other survival games (Rust, Romero's Aftermath and Minecraft etc.) it is still worth a buy. I bought the package with most of the DLC (ArmA 2: Complete Collection, costing $39.99 USD without any sale) making the game look fantastic. Runs extremely well on Windows 7 - 10.There is a deep aspect of survival in this game, making it one of the most realistic zombie post-apocalyptic games on Steam. Heavily refined over the years, Arma 2: DayZ Mod is a fantastic game to play. Great fun with friends and can get lonely playing solo in the in the zombie apocalypse.Does require deep concetration and skill to maximize enjoyment.			"

												This is a really good Military Simulator. there are tons of guns, armaments, objects, etc. you can use to create whatever kind of situation you see fit. like rebels stealing NATO supplies, or US marines taking over Russian FOBs. plus this game has tons of mods, including the infamous ACE/ACRE mod and the ever popular DayZ mod. gamespy might be shutting down next month, but this game will be ever so strong in the Multiplayer department. besides the mods, there are tons of realism units out there, like th 15th MEU and the JTF207, there's a clan out there for everyone. and if you arent into clan based dealings, maybe you could try your hand at an Role Playing server? there are different kinds of RP Life servers on ArmA 2 OA, such as the common Chernarus and Takistan life servers, to ones such as City Life RP and TCG RP servers. like the realism units, there's a community for everyone. the greatness of this game is that you have the freedom to do what ever you want, how you want it, and when you want it.

												     After many months of watching some of my favorite YouTubers play this games extremely popular mod, DayZ, I finally decided to convince one of my friends to buy it and play with me. Our first session was very disappointing because of its clunky controls and glitchy gameplay. We were sad that we wasted our money on it, but decided to give it another shot the following day. After a couple of hours getting use to the controls and figuring things out; we began to love it.      That being said, it has easily turned into one of my favorite games I've played this year. Once you get use to the controls and figure out how to avoid all the glitches it is definitely worth a buy. I would easily recommend you purchasing this game.			"

The multiplayer experince is certainly spectacular with the infinite amount of gamemodes you can play, for instance: Takistan Life, Wasteland, Domination, Deathmatch, Armory(V2,V3, Losis 1.5), and many others!! I recommend this game and Arma 2  100%. Also be sure to purchase the addons for enhanced textures on BAF and PMC models!			"

												I am literally in LOVE with this game.Arma is one of the very few games that has managed to suck out 200+ hours out of me, without me getting bored of the content within game. It is an amazing game that you should have at least tried if you are a gamer, I mean c'mon the Multiplayer of Arma II is free, and the best parts of the game are in the multiplayer!Arma 2 OA is a standalone expansion from Arma 2 and it offers a completely new experience to the other game with a whole new upgrade to the look and feel of the game which is worth the full title cost. It is set in the fictional country of Takistan which is torn apart by the OpFor forces stationed there and is trying to be recovered by the BluFor forces stationed three. The game also allows the player to play in the old map Chernarus, but only if you own a copy of Arma II or have the Arma II Free game installed. The single player gives you the experience of being there and commanding a unit. The single player also features parts where you are in control of your superiors and takes a different direction of how a mission is played. What it does is it gives you and objective, guidelines, but you don’t necessarily have to follow them, but for the sake of story and depth its best to play within reason. The game allows you to learn from your mistakes, adapt or play in way that nobody else has, For example I was in a mission where all my men died, and I had one injured man left, and I had to get to a rendezvous but we had to face about a chalk of men. From constantly dying in the mission, I learnt that I could not protect my teammate as he would die instantly from any damage, so instead of facing the enemy I ran off and took a stealth route, which I could complete but because of AI Intelligence, he couldn't. And it’s because of moments like that, that make the single player something really special.The multiplayer gives you an experience of user created gameplay that very few games allow you to do, and this is one of the trademarks of the series. With some game modes and missions that you can play together with others, most people prefer to play user generated missions or game modes. The mission side of things is very simple. You get given tools that with a basic knowledge of google search or scripting allow you to create a mission that could be put in the single player of the game itself. I myself have made a few of these types of missions, ranging from border patrols, races to a vehicle and weapon showcase created to test out all the vehicles and weapons in the game and enable anyone to learn how to fly a plane or helicopter in game, without getting yelled at for wasting a valuable asset in certain multiplayer game modes. Game modes made by independent developers or groups of people is where the main fan base of the game stands at. Some of these 'gems' include:-Domination, a team based game where you are part of an army working together fighting and liberating towns from the OpFor stationed in them. -DayZ which now has evolved into a standalone game, is a whole new game mode in which you are one of the many survivors of a zombie infestation and you try to live within that scenario getting over the many obstacles that would exist including in depth problems like health and blood loss and social problems like gangs bandits and trust.-I44 is a whole re-branding of the game. It’s called Invasion 1944 and is set during the invasion of American Troops into Europe. The whole game is remade with a WW2 feel, with iconic weapons, gear clothing and vehicles. You have at your disposal, the German, British and American army to play with playing historical battles or some of the user-Generated games modes within Arma II such as DayZ and Domination.-ACE Is an upgrade to the already semi realistic game that Arma is. It offers more depth, challenge and realism and is seen as a mod for the more hard core fans, or people that like a more difficult game or a more enhancing experience in comparison to the vanilla version. It achieves this by adding little details everywhere such as fainting and ear protection from explosions. Also it adds more difficulty with things like shooting and stamina making the game that one step more realistic.-WasteLand is a scavenge and co-operate game mode in which players must earn money to make and but defences for their team, with a goal of domination and annihilation of the other team and the land around. The last game mode I want to talk about RP civilian life or as it’s now known as 'RPG Life'. This game mode adds a Sims like aspect to the game, as you play a civilian who can live his life normally or he can become a criminal or rebel and fight the police force who are in charge of keeping peace in the country. With trading, working and doing normal things like eating and drinking this game mode is one that will never be the same twice. Now this isn’t a full review of the game so I'll stop at the game modes and not expand any further as I could go on forever, talking about this game. So in short I give this game a 85/100, the reasons?Some Positives:-Has a decent campaign with a whole new approach to how a mission can be done-The multiplayer is and unlimited canvas with almost unlimited potential.-The community is a wide and strong one adding a lot to the game itself.-The Semi-Realism is an enhancing experience that adds on a lot to the game.Some Negatives:-There are a lot of fundamental ideas that are expected to be seen in sandboxes that are missing.-There could have been a lot more things done by the developers than just leaving the community to handle it and where there was support it was usually not in the places needed-There are some really bad flaws in AI and horrible animations that really take away from the game			"

I didn't discover this game until 2014 when I started playing the DayZ Mod ""Overpoch"" (Arma II:Operation Arrowhead is the base game for all DayZ mods).This review is for the Overpoch mod more than Operation Arrowhead (which I actually have not played the single player campaign).Like all Arma games, you can sink hours and hours into these games because of the huge mulitude of possibilities.  Overpoch is an excellent mod (it is actually a combination of two separate DayZ mods, Epoch and Overwatch).  It involves crafting, building, PvP, AI missions, and much much more. I highly recommend this game but be prepared to lose many hours of time to it!			"

												If you like fps games its a must have. You can do almost enything you want in this game because of editor and if you want, you can do the missions, they are fun too. The graphics are out dated, but it really dosen't matter because the gameplay makes it up completly. DayZ is also apart of the game so if you get tired of regular singleplayer you can just go and download DayZ commander and play from there.  Also there are lots of mods for the game so you won't get bored of the game intill a long while.  "

												What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany's at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No. I go for the chandelier; it's priceless. As I'm taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I love the cold. Thirty years later I get a postcard. I have a son. And he's the Chief of Police. This is where the story gets interesting: I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the chandelier.			"

												I'll be honest, I (along with thousands of others) bought Arma 2 so I could play the DayZ Mod back when it came out. However out of the base game and the zombie mod, Arma peaked my interest far more than DayZ ever did when I played it. The graphics (albeit shoddy at times) are good enough to be pleasant but aren't a huge hassle on an average PC, and the gameplay had me hooked for hours. Great buy for only £15 too. However the missions are often hard to understand as there are no guidelines in how the game is played or any tutorials at the start. Because of this, the game is hard to grasp and enjoy unless extra effort is made to find these tutorials on the internet.4/5			"

I have roughly about 2000 hours in total on this game both from disc and steam mainly coming from me playing DayZ mods. I would definitely recomend this game if you like survival and tactics within a mil sim.

												Can't review Arma 2 alone idk why lol. Arma 2 is worth $13 if u like a really realistic shooter. The game is really fiddly and hard to play so i don't really like it. Arma 2's dlc is amazing but the base game it self isn't really worth playing. I thought battle field was fiddly but once you play this FWAH. Maybe because i'm a scrub and too used to easy games like C.S and Cod lol. If u can learn well then it's a decent game but get opperation arrowhead expansion for all the mods and stuffs 4/10 For Arma 2Opperation Arrowhead is what u want if you're playing Arma 2. Games like Dayz, Wasteland and Epoc are so fun to play with friends and can still be fun solo. The expansion cost $20 but you'll need the base game as well which can be bought for $25 or $4 with a few extra DLC's. In Operation Arrowhead there are really fun games to play like Epoc, dayz,wasteland and they’re amazing. 6.5/10 idk i just find it hard to play lol can't even fly a heli.

												Great game once you get used to it. Gameplay may look complex at the start but after you learn the basics, its quite an enjoyable game. Large scale map where you can explore and travel around. Recommended to get community missions such as Patrol Operations 2. Capture the Island gamemode is also quite fun. Its a mixed of FPS and also base building. Best to play with friends for a much enjoyable experience.			"

												Probably the best military game every made. I've fallen in love with this game, wether it be in DayZ, wasteland, RPG, or just the base game I can be sure I'm ganna have a good time. The gun play and fighting mechanics are amazing and killing people has a great satisfaction to it. There is nothing more satisfing than sniping the driver out of a moving truck at 500m and watching the truck swerve and smash into a wall. Or when you get in a fire fight and they break your leg but you still manage to kill all 6 guys who are attacking you then crawl across a field to find morfine. Its just a great game and I highly recommend it too anyone who doesn't mind a big learning curve and randomly dying from some guy 700m away with a as50 every once and awhile. Also this is NOT cod so dont expect to be getting like 80 kills. This is a military simulator it is not a arcade shooter. That means no raging please. ANYWAYS... get it. Its amazing game. 10/10			"

												The surprise hit of the year, due to the DayZ mod.  A three year old game with graphics that surprisingly, can hold its own against more modern games.  Some minor annoying engine problems.  Slower, more methodical movements may annoy twitch gamers used to traditional shooters.  But this game is geared to be more of a simulation than a shooter.  Play with an open mind and imagination and you might not be disappointed.  If you just want to shoot and kill stuff this might not be for you.			"

So I bought this game only for Dayz Mod which was awesome at the time. After SA (standalone) was released development and community mostly moved on to SA which is still a mess imho. Arma III is also out for a while which also splited the large community. Is it dead? Absolutely not.This game runns waaay smoother than ARMA 3, it has more content and very solid mods which are still very popular or even more popular than most Arma 3 mods.When you are new to the game and you are not interested in playing solo missions to get to know this game, mechanics, weapons and so on you can just hop on to a coop server and learn how to snipe with a wast variety of guns. Get to know CQC and operate vehicles.After a few hours of coop you might step up to wastland. There is some excellent servers out there which are nowhere to be find in Arma 3. The nr.1 server at the moment (arma 2) is TCF wasteland (110slots). Its a german server but has a huge international community (usa east, canada, UK, germany, russia I even drove a tank with 2 saudis once). This server game me the best Arma 2 experience possible. I dont say that to recruit players but  the balancing is just awesome. There is plenty servers out there which will give you exactly what you need. You think Hellfire Missiles are overpowered? You want no Thermal sights at all? No problem.Last if you are tired from non stop warfare you might want to go around one of the huge maps, loot some food and shoot some zombies along with other players by camping stary sobor or maybe build an awesome base in epoch or what ever Zombie-Mod is being played most atm.I guarantee you there is always something new to try out and even for free. No DLC. Get Arma 2 Combined Operations and you are set for at least a year of playtime.This game always keeps me from playing my ""new"" games since there is always something new to do. And if I should get bored of the hyped mods and server there is always fun guaranteed on wasteland for me. 1927m shot on a APC gunner who is about to rek my teammates. Quickly setup a roadblock with 12 people to keep enemies from getting that F35B jet at a special mission. After that Air-drop them in the enemie base after your team got the F35 and softened up the enemies stronghold 7km away.You are into FPS's which have alot to offer but the price will be 20-50h to learn the basics? This might be for you?You ask yourself why not just skip this one and go Arma 3..better graphics..blabla. Dont! Trust me on this one. Arma 3 is an awesome game but its lacking content. Sure there is Breaking point and the Live(or life) Mods along with king of the hill but I think Arma 2 has more to offer and is more solid with waaaay more content. I love Arma 3 but I think it will take up to 1 or even 2 years to fully catch up with Arma 2.Thats my thoughts on this game.			"

												Don't be fooled by my low playtime. Most of my time playing has been through mod launchers that didn't include steam overlay. My actual time played is likely between 500 and 1,000 hours.I can't recommend the base game without mods because I've never played the base game without mods. ACE and ACRE on a multiplayer server are what make the game amazing, and I don't think it's worth your time to play the single player game unmodded.Arma II is riddled with bugs and problems. It's an incredibly demanding game, even on modern machines. It hogs your CPU and can crash for literally no reason at all. If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.You'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.Sometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.Occasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.Believe me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.Arma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???			"

												This game has a very good multiplayer experience. It's realism will immerse you as if you are really there. There are a variety of guns that not only look like their real-life counterparts, but also act like them. Vehicles in this game are also pretty good. They look pretty much the same with their real-life counter parts but are not that realistic (rocks can easily flip your tank). Some problems with the servers though; it can be easily hack. Also, the controls are rather complicated and practically takes half of your keyboard. The campaign is uninteresting as the characters are flat, the voice acting is unconvincing, and the storyline sucks. But the multiplayer- even though servers are often hacked - are well worth it.

												Arma 2: OA is an amazing game. There is soo much to play in it whether you want to play a life mod, wasteland, DayZ MOD, etc. It's actually hard to believe that this game was made in 2010 and is still better than some games released today. 8/10 -RiNOFocus			"

												I'll be honest, I (along with thousands of others) bought Arma 2 so I could play the DayZ Mod back when it came out. However out of the base game and the zombie mod, Arma peaked my interest far more than DayZ ever did when I played it. The graphics (albeit shoddy at times) are good enough to be pleasant but aren't a huge hassle on an average PC, and the gameplay had me hooked for hours. Great buy for only £15 too. However the missions are often hard to understand as there are no guidelines in how the game is played or any tutorials at the start. Because of this, the game is hard to grasp and enjoy unless extra effort is made to find these tutorials on the internet.4/5			"

												Okay let me start off by saying I have many more hours of gametime than listed above and experience in other ArmA games in the series.  I originally bought this game mainly for Dayz but quickly realized this game has extremely unique and untapped potential in its singleplayer and other vanilla multiplayer modes if you are patient enough to learn how to play them. This game is everything in one a military simulator, ♥♥♥♥ around and troll simulator, building and management, player crafting, open world exploring, mass vehicle battles, zombie apocalypse survival, you name it. This game will give you a unique experience everytime no matter how many hours you place into this you can make friends, have amazing friendships, and betray them and steal everything they love within minutes. Drive around, kidnap innocent people, make them undress, and then shoot them in the legs forcing them to crawl to survival while they get eaten alive by zombies. What's not to love? 10/10 most realistic and unrealistic simulator ever, best to play with a couple of friends. But be wary of strangers you meet, they may shoot you and steal your baked beans.

												Arma 2 : Operation Arrowhead- Where do I begin, First of all the best game i've ever played with friends! Crashing, blowing up, shooting, and huge world action!. Thousands of servers and random missions! And nothing's better than building a base on a wasteland server and defending it from other players. This was the first game I ever played with my friend on steam and I've got to say it does tend to get boring from time to time and frusterating but it is the best way to pass the time with friends there is a wide varity of gamemodes and servers to pick from! Wasteland is a gamemode where you do random missions whenever you want for the team BLUFOR and INDEPENDENT. The INDEPENDENT team can kill whoever they want they're alone. And is a FFA but on some servers you can make a sqaud. Which your friends or whoever will be lit with a teal hexagon. Whats the point of this game? TO HAVE FUN!!!! this game involves skill and thinking for example- ""guys should we capture that heli?"" said Frank. ""Im not sure"" says Jon ""It may be swarming with INDEPENDENTS."" ""Hmm.. your right lets stay away from there."" says Frank while he marks on his map STAY AWAY! NOT SAFE. I've played this game multiple times with my good friends and I always quit the game with a smile on my face. Arma also alows mods with the game such as DAY Z a favorite of all kinds of people ranging from survival from zombies to other players. It can be stressful and very real like when you are losing blood. And you would kill for medical supplies. I once played DAY Z in a match between my 2 friends and a black hawk it came from the sky shooting at us with its minigun armed and shooting us. We all aimed our AS:50's straight at it shooting its engine it went down in a blaze of fire. We yelled with success and kept saying ""WE DID IT! WE DID IT! YES, YES, YES!!!so do i recomend this game uh... according to my review HELL YES!!!!!!!			"

												This game definetely is not for everyone. It takes time and effort to be as good as you dream to be, but oh man once you get good it's awesome. I've never had a more realistic expierince in any game. Though graphics and FPS may not be the best, it is what you expect from this type of game. This game is one of the reasons I saved up for a Gaming pc, and it does not disapoint. There are 2 things that are super annoying about this game. Team killers ( You will come by them at one point or another) and flares not working. It is so annoying to mash the R key and have the missle still smack your choppers♥♥♥♥♥right out of the sky. Not to mention the super annoying squad auto-command/responces. All you will hear is ""under fire"", ""Reloading"", ""need help!"", ""Connot fire!"" over and over and over. Thereis a setting in the options menu that I highly insist you turn off to keep you from hearing this. Other than those minor issues this game was the peas to my carrots!			"

												Arma 2...Is it worth buying? Lets see lets see lets see...Arma 2: Operation is a shooter Military simulation game. Were you can take your own squad into battle. Ok. First of all. If your just looking for another story mode game. Were you can just run and shoot. Then this game is not for you.  And stuff like that. Because if you gets shot 3 times your dead. Now. This game. Got me playing for a few hours now. And it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a little bit. When it comes to Lag. But Arma 2 Has more lag Then Arma 2: Operation. But your computer has like runs like 1000 frames a ####ING secound. Then you don't have to worry about  the ####ing Lag. If you cant buy Arma 3. Then i would buy this with Operation. I got the Dlcs. And i like the Dlcs. Ok So forgot about that. So the gameplay. It's really looks real. When it comes to Military. You shoot Al's from far away. You can control your own squad. And one of the missons on Arma 2. You can even buy units. And If you Think. That this is another one of those games. Were you just level up. No This game is not all about that. It's about Military. And that buy units Part. You could just buy cheap units. [Ingame money] And they would still be useful. Don't think this is Army of Two. [Well you could just do Army of two on a misson.] But you would have to be very skilled. 3 Shots your dead. If your looking for a game. That looks real. And just like real life Military. This game is for you. If your looking for a game were you can just, Run and Gun.[Which means like Call of duty Story. Were you just shoot then. And Run.] Then this game is not for you. So this game is ? Worth a buy👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 YES			"

												The most realistic military-sim you can find. Amazing realsim and gameplay, even more amazing with more people. If you wanna see a video of how it looks in its best form, go see some videos from Dslyecxi´s channel with his ShackTactical community.Even if you are not a hardcore player and you arent in a big team, you are still gonna have a lot of fun. And then there is the editor, such an amazing thing, create any scenario you want. Wanna snipe some bad guys? Hop in to the editor and create an amazing mission for you and/or your friends. The last thing is the amazing addon compatibility. If you need something, go to armaholic.com and you will find what you need. New weapons, entire army, maps, vehicles and tons of missions you can play.still better than Arma 3 "

												Probably the best military game every made. I've fallen in love with this game, wether it be in DayZ, wasteland, RPG, or just the base game I can be sure I'm ganna have a good time. The gun play and fighting mechanics are amazing and killing people has a great satisfaction to it. There is nothing more satisfing than sniping the driver out of a moving truck at 500m and watching the truck swerve and smash into a wall. Or when you get in a fire fight and they break your leg but you still manage to kill all 6 guys who are attacking you then crawl across a field to find morfine. Its just a great game and I highly recommend it too anyone who doesn't mind a big learning curve and randomly dying from some guy 700m away with a as50 every once and awhile. Also this is NOT cod so dont expect to be getting like 80 kills. This is a military simulator it is not a arcade shooter. That means no raging please. ANYWAYS... get it. Its amazing game. 10/10			"

												Can't review Arma 2 alone idk why lol. Arma 2 is worth $13 if u like a really realistic shooter. The game is really fiddly and hard to play so i don't really like it. Arma 2's dlc is amazing but the base game it self isn't really worth playing. I thought battle field was fiddly but once you play this FWAH. Maybe because i'm a scrub and too used to easy games like C.S and Cod lol. If u can learn well then it's a decent game but get opperation arrowhead expansion for all the mods and stuffs 4/10 For Arma 2Opperation Arrowhead is what u want if you're playing Arma 2. Games like Dayz, Wasteland and Epoc are so fun to play with friends and can still be fun solo. The expansion cost $20 but you'll need the base game as well which can be bought for $25 or $4 with a few extra DLC's. In Operation Arrowhead there are really fun games to play like Epoc, dayz,wasteland and they’re amazing. 6.5/10 idk i just find it hard to play lol can't even fly a heli.

												Having proudly served in the 2nd Royal tank Regiment for 27 years, I came into this game with some reservations. Whilst it is not totally accurate, I don`t think any game can be, the developers have come very close to replicating real word weapons and vehicles. The combat itself is ok, although either the standard SA-805 is not in here, or it is in disguise. Minor niggles aside, I can whole heartedly recommend both this game and the DLC.  I have had, and look forward to many more hours of fun, only this time, if I get shot or killed, I can just start again  lol.			"

												This standalone title was released as an addendum to Arma 2. I will try to remain unbiased in this review despite the fact that i am a long time fan of the original OFP and Armed Assault series. This particular chapter of the series epitomises the milsim genre and is the quintessential PC game for people who enjoy working in unison with other players to undertake large virtual military operations on a massive scale, incorporating unique game mechanics resulting in an unwonted interdenomination of varied archetypal game genres   . The game has a great modding community and as such is full of brilliant addons and extra units made by the mod community who use the games Editor mode to stage scenarios for the units they choose to to revolve the scenario around . Ever since Steam added the Workshop feature as a tool for finding and installing addons, its become easier to apply them to the steam version of Arma 2 OA, bypassing the somewhat arduous process of adding downloaded content to their affiliated folders in the games main directory as was the norm before.. Addon content for this game is made by a large active community whos work has been invaluable in making this one of the most comprehensive and realistic combat experiences available to PC gamers and simulation fans worldwide. Activities online ( the best way to experience arma in many ways) range from the casual coop game to the hardcore realistic milsim depending on the servers difficulty settings and rules of engagement..( some clans will go as far as to simulate colloquial jargon used by real soldiers while operating in the field, for added effect and pratical comms ) all milsim'ers will love. Remember Operation flashpoint? It all started in 2001 when Codemasters and Bohemia worked together to create the first ( atleast for me ) truly varied and open, beutifully rendered, 3d world with a fantastic physics engine and Mission editor buildt in to boot. Ahead of its time with its coverage and combination of multiple iconic game genres such as air combat sims, sea and ground based vehicle combat sims as well as  being a solid ground troop FPS with something with the earmarks of a traditional RTS, in giving you the ability to command your troops from an eagle eye point of view while using the games command menu system. It soon became known for its excellent coop online gameplay and paved the way for future incarnations of the Real Virtuality engine. OFP was the predecessor and inspiration for the much later released Arma series wich brought with it a following of the same experienced modders and mission makers behind most of the addons produced for OFP. It all adds up to be one of my favorite games to date hands down. Highly recommended for milsim fans, but not so much for the casual fps player as its complexity can be a bit overwhelming i suppose. Not to mention it's very idiosyncratic, occasionally gamebreaking bugs of the sui generis sort. ( Arma vets facetiously joke about the fact that ''Its just not Arma without all the yardstick bugs'' that have become canonical to the Real Virtuality engine and officiate still today, much to many newcomers and long time players dismay..as if the games complexity wasnt daunting enough already). That said, if your the patient/forgiving type and/or have been subject to the many game breaking save-state corrupting crashes and early bugs of previous titles, chances are youll waver it as a passing early-release symptom and wait for patches and fixes that are usually right around the corner, like a veteran of the series will inevitably do in stride, and still like the game for its intrinsic advantages and pro's, that do, in my opinion, outweigh the cons. ( because arma 2s main campaign was a mess of framerate complications, bugs and other problems. The much anticipated coop campaign mode was broken and unplayable too..,However these are predominantly release date bugs that bohemia frequently releases/released patches to ultimately fix or at least alleviate to the point where said bugs are no longer an issue. If you decide to try any of the Arma games, get ready for a unique experience that for many surpasses the threshhold of standard PC gaming into a world of simulated conflict and war where death means failing your squad members and your every action as a member of a team or on solo campaign missions where you may find yourself out of ammo and running through thick forests hiding from looming Hinds and prowling T-72s all endowed with an astute and accurate AI. It must be said that the single player campaign in OA and in featured a movie like story that would change according to your ability to acclimate quickly to different and often unexpected situations. Its a hard game, especially when playing it with the difficulty settings raised to 'realistic levels' One shot to an unprotected vital body part and you die.  episodically This is player versus CPU unit based online gaming at its best and is surpassed by no other milsim title for its ability to get players submerged in a complex, ambient world where conflict is the theme and victory is a hard earned commodity. Combined operations and teamwork are key to success.			"

												I have actually put a lot more hours into ARMA II, it's one of my all-time favorties. You've got the DayZ Mod on one of side of the spectrum, Island Life in the middle, and Wasteland at the end! Not to forget all of the lovely coop missions, and the incredibly strong singleplayer campaign!			"

So I bought this game only for Dayz Mod which was awesome at the time. After SA (standalone) was released development and community mostly moved on to SA which is still a mess imho. Arma III is also out for a while which also splited the large community. Is it dead? Absolutely not.This game runns waaay smoother than ARMA 3, it has more content and very solid mods which are still very popular or even more popular than most Arma 3 mods.When you are new to the game and you are not interested in playing solo missions to get to know this game, mechanics, weapons and so on you can just hop on to a coop server and learn how to snipe with a wast variety of guns. Get to know CQC and operate vehicles.After a few hours of coop you might step up to wastland. There is some excellent servers out there which are nowhere to be find in Arma 3. The nr.1 server at the moment (arma 2) is TCF wasteland (110slots). Its a german server but has a huge international community (usa east, canada, UK, germany, russia I even drove a tank with 2 saudis once). This server game me the best Arma 2 experience possible. I dont say that to recruit players but  the balancing is just awesome. There is plenty servers out there which will give you exactly what you need. You think Hellfire Missiles are overpowered? You want no Thermal sights at all? No problem.Last if you are tired from non stop warfare you might want to go around one of the huge maps, loot some food and shoot some zombies along with other players by camping stary sobor or maybe build an awesome base in epoch or what ever Zombie-Mod is being played most atm.I guarantee you there is always something new to try out and even for free. No DLC. Get Arma 2 Combined Operations and you are set for at least a year of playtime.This game always keeps me from playing my ""new"" games since there is always something new to do. And if I should get bored of the hyped mods and server there is always fun guaranteed on wasteland for me. 1927m shot on a APC gunner who is about to rek my teammates. Quickly setup a roadblock with 12 people to keep enemies from getting that F35B jet at a special mission. After that Air-drop them in the enemie base after your team got the F35 and softened up the enemies stronghold 7km away.You are into FPS's which have alot to offer but the price will be 20-50h to learn the basics? This might be for you?You ask yourself why not just skip this one and go Arma 3..better graphics..blabla. Dont! Trust me on this one. Arma 3 is an awesome game but its lacking content. Sure there is Breaking point and the Live(or life) Mods along with king of the hill but I think Arma 2 has more to offer and is more solid with waaaay more content. I love Arma 3 but I think it will take up to 1 or even 2 years to fully catch up with Arma 2.Thats my thoughts on this game.			"

												Don't be fooled by my low playtime. Most of my time playing has been through mod launchers that didn't include steam overlay. My actual time played is likely between 500 and 1,000 hours.I can't recommend the base game without mods because I've never played the base game without mods. ACE and ACRE on a multiplayer server are what make the game amazing, and I don't think it's worth your time to play the single player game unmodded.Arma II is riddled with bugs and problems. It's an incredibly demanding game, even on modern machines. It hogs your CPU and can crash for literally no reason at all. If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.You'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.Sometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.Occasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.Believe me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.Arma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???			"

												One of the best games, I've played. It has it's bugs, and doesn't do too well on physics, but if you can forgive those flaws this game will give you COUNTLESS hours of mindless fun on the editor, and scenerios. Now modding it is a whole other story, It adds a whole new layer of fun on top of it by adding tons of new FREE content. If you do intend to pick this up for DayZ, be sure to try out the vanilla game. I assure you it will keep you entertained for days and weeks on end. It has a learning curve I'll admit but once your 100 to 200 hours into it, you will be addicted. 10/10 Great game, worth the money.			"

												Arma 2...Is it worth buying? Lets see lets see lets see...Arma 2: Operation is a shooter Military simulation game. Were you can take your own squad into battle. Ok. First of all. If your just looking for another story mode game. Were you can just run and shoot. Then this game is not for you.  And stuff like that. Because if you gets shot 3 times your dead. Now. This game. Got me playing for a few hours now. And it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off a little bit. When it comes to Lag. But Arma 2 Has more lag Then Arma 2: Operation. But your computer has like runs like 1000 frames a ####ING secound. Then you don't have to worry about  the ####ing Lag. If you cant buy Arma 3. Then i would buy this with Operation. I got the Dlcs. And i like the Dlcs. Ok So forgot about that. So the gameplay. It's really looks real. When it comes to Military. You shoot Al's from far away. You can control your own squad. And one of the missons on Arma 2. You can even buy units. And If you Think. That this is another one of those games. Were you just level up. No This game is not all about that. It's about Military. And that buy units Part. You could just buy cheap units. [Ingame money] And they would still be useful. Don't think this is Army of Two. [Well you could just do Army of two on a misson.] But you would have to be very skilled. 3 Shots your dead. If your looking for a game. That looks real. And just like real life Military. This game is for you. If your looking for a game were you can just, Run and Gun.[Which means like Call of duty Story. Were you just shoot then. And Run.] Then this game is not for you. So this game is ? Worth a buy👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 👍 YES			"

If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.You'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.Sometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.Occasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.Believe me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.Arma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???			"

You've got the DayZ Mod on one of side of the spectrum, Island Life in the middle, and Wasteland at the end! Not to forget all of the lovely coop missions, and the incredibly strong singleplayer campaign!			"

												Arma II: Operation Arrowhead is an expansion pack of Arma II and was released in 2010. I didn't discover this game until 2014 when I started playing the DayZ Mod ""Overpoch"" (Arma II:Operation Arrowhead is the base game for all DayZ mods).This review is for the Overpoch mod more than Operation Arrowhead (which I actually have not played the single player campaign).Like all Arma games, you can sink hours and hours into these games because of the huge mulitude of possibilities.  Overpoch is an excellent mod (it is actually a combination of two separate DayZ mods, Epoch and Overwatch).  It involves crafting, building, PvP, AI missions, and much much more. I highly recommend this game but be prepared to lose many hours of time to it!			"

												Can't review Arma 2 alone idk why lol. Arma 2 is worth $13 if u like a really realistic shooter. The game is really fiddly and hard to play so i don't really like it. Arma 2's dlc is amazing but the base game it self isn't really worth playing. I thought battle field was fiddly but once you play this FWAH. Maybe because i'm a scrub and too used to easy games like C.S and Cod lol. If u can learn well then it's a decent game but get opperation arrowhead expansion for all the mods and stuffs 4/10 For Arma 2Opperation Arrowhead is what u want if you're playing Arma 2. Games like Dayz, Wasteland and Epoc are so fun to play with friends and can still be fun solo. The expansion cost $20 but you'll need the base game as well which can be bought for $25 or $4 with a few extra DLC's. In Operation Arrowhead there are really fun games to play like Epoc, dayz,wasteland and they’re amazing. 6.5/10 idk i just find it hard to play lol can't even fly a heli. For Arma 28/10 Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead			"

												This standalone title was released as an addendum to Arma 2. I will try to remain unbiased in this review despite the fact that i am a long time fan of the original OFP and Armed Assault series. This particular chapter of the series epitomises the milsim genre and is the quintessential PC game for people who enjoy working in unison with other players to undertake large virtual military operations on a massive scale, incorporating unique game mechanics resulting in an unwonted interdenomination of varied archetypal game genres   . The game has a great modding community and as such is full of brilliant addons and extra units made by the mod community who use the games Editor mode to stage scenarios for the units they choose to to revolve the scenario around . Ever since Steam added the Workshop feature as a tool for finding and installing addons, its become easier to apply them to the steam version of Arma 2 OA, bypassing the somewhat arduous process of adding downloaded content to their affiliated folders in the games main directory as was the norm before.. Addon content for this game is made by a large active community whos work has been invaluable in making this one of the most comprehensive and realistic combat experiences available to PC gamers and simulation fans worldwide. Activities online ( the best way to experience arma in many ways) range from the casual coop game to the hardcore realistic milsim depending on the servers difficulty settings and rules of engagement..( some clans will go as far as to simulate colloquial jargon used by real soldiers while operating in the field, for added effect and pratical comms ) all milsim'ers will love. Remember Operation flashpoint? It all started in 2001 when Codemasters and Bohemia worked together to create the first ( atleast for me ) truly varied and open, beutifully rendered, 3d world with a fantastic physics engine and Mission editor buildt in to boot. Ahead of its time with its coverage and combination of multiple iconic game genres such as air combat sims, sea and ground based vehicle combat sims as well as  being a solid ground troop FPS with something with the earmarks of a traditional RTS, in giving you the ability to command your troops from an eagle eye point of view while using the games command menu system. It soon became known for its excellent coop online gameplay and paved the way for future incarnations of the Real Virtuality engine. OFP was the predecessor and inspiration for the much later released Arma series wich brought with it a following of the same experienced modders and mission makers behind most of the addons produced for OFP. It all adds up to be one of my favorite games to date hands down. Highly recommended for milsim fans, but not so much for the casual fps player as its complexity can be a bit overwhelming i suppose. Not to mention it's very idiosyncratic, occasionally gamebreaking bugs of the sui generis sort. ( Arma vets facetiously joke about the fact that ''Its just not Arma without all the yardstick bugs'' that have become canonical to the Real Virtuality engine and officiate still today, much to many newcomers and long time players dismay..as if the games complexity wasnt daunting enough already). That said, if your the patient/forgiving type and/or have been subject to the many game breaking save-state corrupting crashes and early bugs of previous titles, chances are youll waver it as a passing early-release symptom and wait for patches and fixes that are usually right around the corner, like a veteran of the series will inevitably do in stride, and still like the game for its intrinsic advantages and pro's, that do, in my opinion, outweigh the cons. ( because arma 2s main campaign was a mess of framerate complications, bugs and other problems. The much anticipated coop campaign mode was broken and unplayable too..,However these are predominantly release date bugs that bohemia frequently releases/released patches to ultimately fix or at least alleviate to the point where said bugs are no longer an issue. If you decide to try any of the Arma games, get ready for a unique experience that for many surpasses the threshhold of standard PC gaming into a world of simulated conflict and war where death means failing your squad members and your every action as a member of a team or on solo campaign missions where you may find yourself out of ammo and running through thick forests hiding from looming Hinds and prowling T-72s all endowed with an astute and accurate AI. It must be said that the single player campaign in OA and in featured a movie like story that would change according to your ability to acclimate quickly to different and often unexpected situations. Its a hard game, especially when playing it with the difficulty settings raised to 'realistic levels' One shot to an unprotected vital body part and you die.  episodically This is player versus CPU unit based online gaming at its best and is surpassed by no other milsim title for its ability to get players submerged in a complex, ambient world where conflict is the theme and victory is a hard earned commodity. Combined operations and teamwork are key to success.			"

												One of the best games, I've played. It has it's bugs, and doesn't do too well on physics, but if you can forgive those flaws this game will give you COUNTLESS hours of mindless fun on the editor, and scenerios. Now modding it is a whole other story, It adds a whole new layer of fun on top of it by adding tons of new FREE content. If you do intend to pick this up for DayZ, be sure to try out the vanilla game. I assure you it will keep you entertained for days and weeks on end. It has a learning curve I'll admit but once your 100 to 200 hours into it, you will be addicted. 10/10 Great game, worth the money.			"

You still have everything from Arma 2, and it adds more missions and alot of details are changed and it does help the over all game itself "

												Arma 2 Review:The short; A great game, with great physics, perhaps the best for its time. Great graphics has well, night and day cycles well. Controls are a slightly confusing for some people, but can be modified and adjusted to the users liking. However for  fast for people who are willing to learn the controls are positioned quite well (Except the in-game VOIP). Game play itself is great has well. Single player has one of the best storys, with multiple endings and quite long in length (You can even finish the game early and get a ""secret ending""). However the multiplayer is perhaps the best place to enjoy the game to its full. Not met a game like it ever (Except Arma 3... but thats next in the series anyway). Cant list any real flaws, at least none that i noticed, except for the steep learning curve. Arma 2 OA adds some greater graphics, new story and new area to play around in; this is a great expansion and exactly what we needed. Furthurmore this is a great modding platform. Some of the best role play experiences i have had come from this game. The Life mode, and the DayZ mod(s) are great community produced items that have shown that giving the community the right tools, a great concept can be made. I highly recommend this game based on the price, the mods, and the game play of the ""vanilla"" game. Great experience, and i hope to see you on some DayZ mods. *Hint* I am not friendly. "

												I got this standalone for the Invasion 1944 mod.I am a HUGE WW2 game fan but I also love tactical games. This (and Brothers in Arms) are the perfect combination.Anyways, let's get to the actual game, not mods.The game has great gameplay but I was not impressed with the graphics as much. The graphics are OK for the time, but not only did the first Call of Duty have better graphics than this, but Arma 3 had better graphics for 2013, like, BY FAR.You may see the time I have played the game and I know it isn't much. It's just 6.9 hours at the moment. That's because though video games may be very important to me, I'm just gonna say it, I'm not one of those addicts that play 1,000 hours in the first few months of the game being out. Anyways, overall, I'd rate it a 7.9/10.			"

But i play a lot with retail version but because i'm scared that my copy of retail with broken i purchase this and try to install on my laptop. I know it sound crazy but it can run. Even the game is resource hog :) but it good game i remember to play it alone the whole day on warfare mission which is the most mode in arma that i'm enjoyIf you look for simulator with air , land , inf this one may be your choice as you can enjoy it with friend or alone also the game is awesome with mod. I really love this game but sad arma 3 setting is not at modern time like this one. I recommend this game for everyone. But remember install ACE mod to make ai more like human heheEnjoy the game hope this review help			"

												This may be the greatest game in existence.Despite its many bugs and glitches it is a great game. Hundreds of hours of fun. Even with the amount of time I've put into this game I've barely scratched the surface. And most of that has come solely from the level editor.The editor is really fun to play around with, helicopter raids, tank missions, HALO jumps, patrols, ambushes, you name it, you can more than likely do it.The only real problem you might encounter with this game is its difficulty. There is a pretty steep learning curve to get used to it. Theres no second lives, theres no attack dog bonuses. It is probably as close as you'll ever get to war.I wouldn't recommend this to any looking for a quick, CoD style deathmatch. ArmA II's combat takes patience, practice and more patience. A definate must-buy for anyone looking for some large scale warfare, tactical combat or military simulation games.			"

												Most people buy this game for the ""Dayz Mod"" - an awesome game filled with excitement and adventure. But most also miss out on the content of the original which is Arma II itself. This game may be , some say , old but don't be fooled it's a great game. At first you may find the controls and movements weird in a way, but once you get used to it it's perfect. The campaigns and missions are really dynamic for a fact and filled with loads of content. Same as multiplayer, it's really good in terms of tactics and realism especially when played in the world of Dayz. "

Large scale map where you can explore and travel around. Recommended to get community missions such as Patrol Operations 2. Capture the Island gamemode is also quite fun. Its a mixed of FPS and also base building. Best to play with friends for a much enjoyable experience.			"

												This arguably one of the most in depth military games out there, the modding community has also really made some stellar missions, and other content. There is an entire website dedicated to new vehicles, weapons, camo, game over hauls, and maps. It really has something for everyone, and can also be modded to play the famous DayZ mod which has countless hours on its on. Arma II: OA really shouldn't be called a game, its more like a sampler. You can literally play exactly what you want, if its an idea there is a mod it really is a shining example of what cooperation between a developer and their fanbase should look like in the whole industry.The game can be demanding on your setup so make sure you have a good CPU, lots of ram, and decent graphics card. The settings cranked in this game make it pretty damn gorgeous so you will not be dissapointed. The game is often on sale as are all of the initial dlcs, which add various new things, and also unlock the full potential of high res texturing.			"

So I bought this game only for Dayz Mod which was awesome at the time. After SA (standalone) was released development and community mostly moved on to SA which is still a mess imho. Arma III is also out for a while which also splited the large community. Is it dead? Absolutely not.This game runns waaay smoother than ARMA 3, it has more content and very solid mods which are still very popular or even more popular than most Arma 3 mods.When you are new to the game and you are not interested in playing solo missions to get to know this game, mechanics, weapons and so on you can just hop on to a coop server and learn how to snipe with a wast variety of guns. Get to know CQC and operate vehicles.After a few hours of coop you might step up to wastland. There is some excellent servers out there which are nowhere to be find in Arma 3. The nr.1 server at the moment (arma 2) is TCF wasteland (110slots). Its a german server but has a huge international community (usa east, canada, UK, germany, russia I even drove a tank with 2 saudis once). This server game me the best Arma 2 experience possible. I dont say that to recruit players but  the balancing is just awesome. There is plenty servers out there which will give you exactly what you need. You think Hellfire Missiles are overpowered? You want no Thermal sights at all? No problem.Last if you are tired from non stop warfare you might want to go around one of the huge maps, loot some food and shoot some zombies along with other players by camping stary sobor or maybe build an awesome base in epoch or what ever Zombie-Mod is being played most atm.I guarantee you there is always something new to try out and even for free. No DLC. Get Arma 2 Combined Operations and you are set for at least a year of playtime.This game always keeps me from playing my ""new"" games since there is always something new to do. And if I should get bored of the hyped mods and server there is always fun guaranteed on wasteland for me. 1927m shot on a APC gunner who is about to rek my teammates. Quickly setup a roadblock with 12 people to keep enemies from getting that F35B jet at a special mission. After that Air-drop them in the enemie base after your team got the F35 and softened up the enemies stronghold 7km away.You are into FPS's which have alot to offer but the price will be 20-50h to learn the basics? This might be for you?You ask yourself why not just skip this one and go Arma 3..better graphics..blabla. Dont! Trust me on this one. Arma 3 is an awesome game but its lacking content. Sure there is Breaking point and the Live(or life) Mods along with king of the hill but I think Arma 2 has more to offer and is more solid with waaaay more content. I love Arma 3 but I think it will take up to 1 or even 2 years to fully catch up with Arma 2.Thats my thoughts on this game.			"

												Don't be fooled by my low playtime. Most of my time playing has been through mod launchers that didn't include steam overlay. My actual time played is likely between 500 and 1,000 hours.I can't recommend the base game without mods because I've never played the base game without mods. ACE and ACRE on a multiplayer server are what make the game amazing, and I don't think it's worth your time to play the single player game unmodded.Arma II is riddled with bugs and problems. It's an incredibly demanding game, even on modern machines. It hogs your CPU and can crash for literally no reason at all. If you're playing with other people (as you should) you'll likely spend hours standing around doing nothing, then get shot in the first few seconds of a firefight and spend the next five minutes staring at a black screen until the death screen pops up because you bled out.You'll drive down a dirt road at a snails pace watching for IEDs, only to get blown up by one you didn't see hidden in a bush. Then you'll drive down the same road, again, and when you arrive at you area of operation you'll take a bullet to the head and die instantly.Sometimes you'll have to sit around on a hilltop looking at enemies for 30 minutes while you wait for your fireteam leader to radio the squad leader, who then has to radio command, who then has to radio back questions, which are relayed to your fireteam leader, who answer them back to the squad leader, who radios back to command, who radios back to squad leader permission to engage, who sends back to your fireteam leader, who then tells you you can engage. And that's if everyone is listening to each other. More likely you'll sit around for thirty minutes while the fireteam leader tries to contact the squad leader who doesn't even have their radio on.Occasionally you'll gear up for a halo jump or fastrope operation, gather everyone on the tarmac, load up into the helicopter, wait for the pilot to discuss drop zone with your officers, then after fifteen minutes of flying your screen will go black with the sound of a surface to air missle blowing a hole through the cockpit.Believe me when I say Arma II has been the most fun and engaging video game I've ever played and if I could only have one game for the rest of my life it would be this.Arma III is apparently getting ok but it makes me sad that Arma II is being replace WHY CAN'T WE KEEP ARMA II OPERATIONS CAPTAIN? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME???			"

												One of the best games, I've played. It has it's bugs, and doesn't do too well on physics, but if you can forgive those flaws this game will give you COUNTLESS hours of mindless fun on the editor, and scenerios. Now modding it is a whole other story, It adds a whole new layer of fun on top of it by adding tons of new FREE content. If you do intend to pick this up for DayZ, be sure to try out the vanilla game. I assure you it will keep you entertained for days and weeks on end. It has a learning curve I'll admit but once your 100 to 200 hours into it, you will be addicted. 10/10 Great game, worth the money.			"

												Arma 2 is an AMAZING and realistic war game and will always go down as one of my favorite games on its own. But i do not recommend that you play Arma 2 with out the Operation Arrowhead expansion, because this expansion just makes the game look and feel alot better. You still have everything from Arma 2, and it adds more missions and alot of details are changed and it does help the over all game itself "

												This game is so realistic everytime I play it I feel like I should be paid a salary. One time I developed an extreme emotional bond with one of my AI squad members, when he died I cried for three full days and had to eat a tub of ice-cream and watch the notebook 17 times to calm myself down.8/10 -I'll never forget you Dave, you were a true ally			"

												It's Bohemia Interactive's ArmA dude!Seriously i have no idea where they put the thumbs down button on BIS games, so i will just give this a deserved thumbs up for:-Best community support ever.-Best open world simulator ever (always has been since 2001).-Best not-greedy game creator of the entire world.I have never reviewed any of BIS games so far, because everyone knows OFP, ArmA, etc...or don't they? It would be like announcing a king who has been firmly enthroned for 14 years, and unchallenged throughout all this time.Go BIS!			"

												Great game. Make sure you pick it up on sale in the complete package 7.99$. I picked it up for the DayZ Mod. Arma2 itself is excellent tho. Not much left for multi-player, but single player is good and you can play with anything in the game thru the armory and training. 9/10.			"

												Arma II OA was and is still a great game to have. Many mods, scripts and fixes for all kinds of gameplay but most of all, DayZ fans first home.Arma II has alot to offer fans especially if you enjoy war games such as BF COD RO. Destroy-able buildings, many vehicles, full control over battlefields and of course tons of weapons.OA is about rebel forces tied with Takistan forces giving new content, new map & a new feeling to the game known as Arma.Graphics: 7.8SFX: 5.2Gameplay: 8.0Fun Factor: 7.0Total Rating: 6.5			"

												This game is insane, this is definetly the most realistic game, ive ever played. I originally picked this up to play the DayZ Mod (which is great by the way), but I had no idea what else was out there, the arma II editor is crazy. There are servers like Wasteland, Island Life, and a absolute ton of custom maps, I have owned this game for about 2 years now, (July 18th 2012, don't quote me on that) and I am still playing it today, I have a lot more hours but they won't show because I played DayZ on DayZ Commander. I truly recommend this game to anyone that likes realism, intense firefights, and is generally a hardcore FPS player.			"

												I was selling oil when a 7 year-old demanded I give him my money before he pulled out a snub nosed revolver and shot the tire off my truck. I faked a surrender before punching him in the nose and grabbing the gun. Holding the gun steady, the iron sights positioned with his bald chrome dome right in the center, I said: ""Make my day, punk."" before I delivered a .357 round right in his forehead. As his blood splattered across the hot desert sands I holstered the weapon, walking around to the back of my truck and retrieving a handy tool-kit which I used to replace the flat tire. I drove away from that place, and that fresh corpse, with a tingling satisfaction. Yet, I still felt dissapointment. Why did it always have to come to violence?10/10 Would re-examine the depressing duality of human existence again			"

												The most realistic military-sim you can find. Amazing realsim and gameplay, even more amazing with more people. If you wanna see a video of how it looks in its best form, go see some videos from Dslyecxi´s channel with his ShackTactical community.Even if you are not a hardcore player and you arent in a big team, you are still gonna have a lot of fun. And then there is the editor, such an amazing thing, create any scenario you want. Wanna snipe some bad guys? Hop in to the editor and create an amazing mission for you and/or your friends. The last thing is the amazing addon compatibility. If you need something, go to armaholic.com and you will find what you need. New weapons, entire army, maps, vehicles and tons of missions you can play.still better than Arma 3 "

												This is a really good Military Simulator. there are tons of guns, armaments, objects, etc. you can use to create whatever kind of situation you see fit. like rebels stealing NATO supplies, or US marines taking over Russian FOBs. plus this game has tons of mods, including the infamous ACE/ACRE mod and the ever popular DayZ mod. gamespy might be shutting down next month, but this game will be ever so strong in the Multiplayer department. besides the mods, there are tons of realism units out there, like th 15th MEU and the JTF207, there's a clan out there for everyone. and if you arent into clan based dealings, maybe you could try your hand at an Role Playing server? there are different kinds of RP Life servers on ArmA 2 OA, such as the common Chernarus and Takistan life servers, to ones such as City Life RP and TCG RP servers. like the realism units, there's a community for everyone. the greatness of this game is that you have the freedom to do what ever you want, how you want it, and when you want it.

												An amazing addon for an already great game, heck, if this game was released even w/out ArmA II, this could be a game of it's own! Final rating for this expansion 9/10, whole new campaigns, and some new units to those who love creating their own battles!			"

												Allow me to tell you a story about one of my many DAYZ experiences.I was an experienced, well equipped and ruthless bandit settled down in the northwestern region of Chernarussia on my favorite Epoch server. I was camping a medical mission, ever so carefully scanning the treeline with the scope mounted on my Designated Marksman Rifle. Just as I was about to give in and depart back to my base, I saw a rather distraught, careless Bambi wandering through the treeline I had been scanning. At the time, I was situated in a grouping of thick bushes, wearing a ghillie suit to camouflage me from anyone who dared to oppose me. I grinned, thinking that with one left click I could drop another pathetic Bambi, adding another murder to my endless list. I was about to do just that, when the Bambi turned, and looked straight at me. He stopped dead in his tracks, a look of regret and fear painted over his face. He held only a 5.56 mm M4A1 in his grasp, and wore the default spawn model. For the first time in my bandit experience, I felt sympathy. I felt like there was more meaning to this game than to mindlessly kill fellow survivors. My heart dropped when I realized that I had carelessly murdered hundreds of others like him. It was this moment I had decided to muster up the little humanity left in my heart, and spare the poor fellow. I felt good about my decision. I stood up, grinning ear to ear. I mashed the Q and E keys on my keyboard, indicating I was friendly. And then suddenly, a gunshot rang out, the bullet whizzing right passed my ear. I stood there in disbelief. The Bambi's gun was smoking, his face detirmed, filled with stupidity and bloodthirst.Except he was playing on a♥♥♥♥♥♥machine that granted him most likely a pathetic 10 FPS. I chuckled to myself, and blasted the sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s brains onto the trees behind him.One more Bambi added to my list. He was among much more to come in the future. It was worth tho cus he had mtn dew on him that sold for a hefty one 10oz gold my nig			"

Community- very active.- Mod community is very active.- Island Life and/or Takistan Life are  GREAT mods if you like roleplay.Gameplay-Good tactical gameplay functions.-If you just got the gaame, there are multiple scenarios to play that will  get you used to the game.Graphics -Does not take too much to play this game.-I play on a laptop with graphics all the way down and it runs fine, but if you have a desktop you should be ok for graphics on medium +.Bottom LineFantastic game. Obviously i think that this game is worth it considering i have that many hours playing it.**see my page for pictures of me playing island life**Thanks.			"

This hard controll system game likes to use your brain as a weapon. Hide, crawl and steady your aim gets this game a physix mind brawl control mastery. Know your PC when you play this one.

												Pros: 1) Feels like a military simulation game ,not another CoD or BF clone.         2) Hundreds of different mods. You can find Vietnam,WW2,Korean War,Afghanistan and Iraq  mods.You name it.         3) Multiplayer is a life experience. Join a well organised clan ,experience unique events and scenarios.          4) Active community and lots of well populated servers.         5) The map editor provides absolute freedom on creating your own scenarios.         6) You need the game in order to play the DayZ mods. ( orelse you can buy the DayZ:Standalone) Cons: 1) All of the campaigns in single player .Nothing special about them .          2) Really hard to install the mods manually.          3) Game is getting old . You possibly have to move to Arma 3 within a couple of years.Verdict : One of the best games i ve ever played !			"

												This game is awesome i bought it just for my collection. But i play a lot with retail version but because i'm scared that my copy of retail with broken i purchase this and try to install on my laptop. I know it sound crazy but it can run. Even the game is resource hog :) but it good game i remember to play it alone the whole day on warfare mission which is the most mode in arma that i'm enjoyIf you look for simulator with air , land , inf this one may be your choice as you can enjoy it with friend or alone also the game is awesome with mod. I really love this game but sad arma 3 setting is not at modern time like this one. I recommend this game for everyone. But remember install ACE mod to make ai more like human heheEnjoy the game hope this review help			"

												I haven't played too much just yet, but I definitely can see that this is an amazing game, quite nicely replicating that military feel. Get ambushed, prepare an ambush, drop support, rain hail after hail of artillery shells, build a base, buy tons of weapons, tons of units, explore massive maps, work as a team with your allies, and face brutal and sudden deaths. Fly attack helicopters, get rammed while flying by another plane/heli, drive a tank, command massive squads, snipe and firefight all with realistic bullet drop, and more. Go nightvision, parachute out of a plane, get pinned down, run out of ammo, get utterly slaughtered. 15/10 Role-Playable-good and spot on.You'll find the best experience on an up-to-date computer with decent performance characteristics.

												Allow me to tell you a story about one of my many DAYZ experiences.I was an experienced, well equipped and ruthless bandit settled down in the northwestern region of Chernarussia on my favorite Epoch server. I was camping a medical mission, ever so carefully scanning the treeline with the scope mounted on my Designated Marksman Rifle. Just as I was about to give in and depart back to my base, I saw a rather distraught, careless Bambi wandering through the treeline I had been scanning. At the time, I was situated in a grouping of thick bushes, wearing a ghillie suit to camouflage me from anyone who dared to oppose me. I grinned, thinking that with one left click I could drop another pathetic Bambi, adding another murder to my endless list. I was about to do just that, when the Bambi turned, and looked straight at me. He stopped dead in his tracks, a look of regret and fear painted over his face. He held only a 5.56 mm M4A1 in his grasp, and wore the default spawn model. For the first time in my bandit experience, I felt sympathy. I felt like there was more meaning to this game than to mindlessly kill fellow survivors. My heart dropped when I realized that I had carelessly murdered hundreds of others like him. It was this moment I had decided to muster up the little humanity left in my heart, and spare the poor fellow. I felt good about my decision. I stood up, grinning ear to ear. I mashed the Q and E keys on my keyboard, indicating I was friendly. And then suddenly, a gunshot rang out, the bullet whizzing right passed my ear. I stood there in disbelief. The Bambi's gun was smoking, his face detirmed, filled with stupidity and bloodthirst.Except he was playing on a♥♥♥♥♥♥machine that granted him most likely a pathetic 10 FPS. I chuckled to myself, and blasted the sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥'s brains onto the trees behind him.One more Bambi added to my list. He was among much more to come in the future. It was worth tho cus he had mtn dew on him that sold for a hefty one 10oz gold my nig			"

												Great game with even better mods (DayZ, Epoch etc.. )Even tho this game is really old, it still is playable and definitely enjoyable, the DayZ mod is just pure awesomenes, you can do pretty much anything, from pvp to base building to fishing.Despite all of the cool features, DayZ has something that other games don't, or atleast it used to have it, people and the awesome feeling when you are running throught a forest in the night with zombies behind you. Even tho this game has many bugs and sometimes it will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, i doubt that i will ever find a different game that i will enjoy like i enjoyed the DayZ mod.This game just brings up so many memories, and i have met so many cool people just because of this game. But thats how DayZ used to be, now DayZ is more like a pvp based  game, thanks to the DayZ Overpoch ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥*.You can still find some cool servers, or play the vanilla, so if you are thinking of buying the game, go for it, you might not get as much expierience as the old players got, but as i said it is still a cool gameGraphics- 7/10Story (A2)- 4,5/10 (I never really liked the story of Arma, like many others i bought it because of DayZ)Mod support 10/10if you still aren't sure about buying this game, just watch some of Frankies old videos.

												Had the best multiplayer experience with this game a few years ago.I was hopping through servers when I chanced upon a SERIOUS server. As soon as I logged in, a guy told me to immediately head to the chopper and I will be briefed while in the air. When the chopper took off, the mission details were given to us through voice chat. I was assigned to the sniper group and was told to follow the point man.The helicopter dropped our group off a hill near the target location. Drop off was fast, as soon as the last person from our group got off, the chopper immediately lifted off to take other teams to their designated position.So we were there by the hill watching the other group enter the target area through our scopes. I can hear people coordinating through voice chat, barking orders in hushed tones. I was there watching from afar as they slowly sweep through the area. The air was tense and I tried my best to stay vigilant watching out for any hostiles.After a while of this. We were informed that the mission was a success. Turns out there were no hostiles in the area but the mission objective (To clear the area) was a success. It may seem like an uneventful mission. But I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.Good times.			"

												The game itself + the dayz mod makes this game a must buy in my book verry realistic army thurd or first person shooter and the dayz mod is a great way to play... It makes the game into an awesome zombie servival shooter where you can collect parts and build car's/ helicopters, and try to servive by finding food water ammo and med supplies all while trying to avoid gitting eaten or shot in an ever changeing envirnment with a risk vs reward system that sets this mod appart from anything ive seen in a long time but be careful though because your not the olny one trying to servive the zombies and they might not be as forgiveing as the zombies are... I meen if zombies were forgiveing :P 10/10Note: the dayz mod is on a presistant timeclock that is set to the timezone the server is located in what this meens is if you log into a server thats hosted out of the US it may be pich black and you will have to use torches to see anything good luck with that....

												Pretty great game. If you didn't get it for DayZ (like most people seem to have), then get it jsut for standard, or the dozens of other mods out there. INcredibly fun to play scenarios wtih friends, among the dozens of other game-modes and mods out there. Definately worth it.			"

Someone kill him""- Im on it.- Go to a high building- Shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, He's knocked out- Run over to kill him- Climb up ladder, game bugs and I fall off and die- Go back to get my gear back- My dead body is now stuck in a wall, I can't loot it.- Get shot in the head.Don't play this game on Friday the 13th.

												This game is the best zombie survival games out their for pc. This game lets you run around and do whatever you may content, but you may have to instal some mods first. Mods on this game make Arma 2 DayZ Mod Amazing. The mods are different maps and differents weapons in those maps. Personally i enjoy DayZ namalsk, DayZ epoch, DayZ Overwatch, and Obviously DayZ Lingor. This game really lets to experience to survival and military survival playthrough. Some Maps have missions, and some just let you roam around and gather supplies. One goal, Survive or be eaten. Dont allways think zombies are the only people to watch out for. People, they are comming and they are everywhere!The Game: 10/10My game: 9/10 Because of the lag on my bad computer.			"

												I played OFP ( still do ) for hours and hours, online, offline, modded or Vanilla. Back in those days i was amazed by the immersion and realism ( as in how hard it actually is to hit targets while running for your life ) and the well though off storyline. Then came ARMA ( still play that too ) and ARMA II and graphics improved, AI got better and a whole new world opened with addons like ACE and a diversity of vehicles and units ( even our proud Dutch army is modded...wich makes me proud as i served there for 15 years ). So, the Pro's :Modding is almost endless...annything you might want, it's there...It looks and feels nice, but on older systems you will have to trade looks for performance because it's a heavy game!Con's :The campaign is virtually unplayable, buggs and triggers / scripts that don't work can make your game feel incomplete.It's NOT an ARCADE type, Battlefield, COD shooter...there's a steep learning curve for firsttimers.Conclusion :Is it worth buying? Hell YES it is! If you like tactical and full immersive online war, this is your thing.			"

												I originally bought the game just to play DayZ Epoch, which I can say I loved...I really had no interest in another military first person shooter, I already played enough, the Battlefield series (Great series) , Medal of Honor (Good series) , America's Army (O.K.) and Call of Duty series (Garbage), I know all you CoD fan-boys will hate me for that, but in my opinion it went down hill after Call of Duty 2 . Then the DayZ Epoch server I played on shut down, shortly there after my friend who got me playing, stop playing and went on to other games, and my Arma 2 collections sat un-played.From time to time I would try other DayZ mods and servers, most filled with jerks and hackers...Then I discovered DaiZy a single player mod of DayZ, I started playing again and trying some of the different DaiZy mods available, I was having fun again...that lead to finding other mods for the Arma 2 collection like Day of Survival and a host of others...Now I play DaiZy, DoS and the actual game and I love it.I have to say it's the Best Military First Person Shooter I have ever played, and with all the different mods out there for it and the ability to edit your own missions it has a ton of re-play value!I highly recommend buying the whole Arma 2 collection if you want a in depth Military First Person Shooter with a ton of different way to play!

												One of the reasons to why i built myself a computer, was that Arma 2 was only available on PC. Arma II Operation Arrowhead is what i would describe as the best Mil Sim that is commerically available. Released in 2010, Operation Arrowhead expanded the features of Arma II and enhanced the game a lot. Instead of playing in Chernarus, a new map, Takistan was introduced to the Mix. A combination of Dunes, Settlements and Airbases is what made this map special for me. Honestly, Most of my time was spent on the mission editior, just making new scenarios for my friends when we would play multiplayer. You have to have a basic understanding of programming in order to make Fluid and Fun mission, as the Mission editor does not hold your hand, it throws you out into the big world, where you either consult forums or learn by trial and error. In regards to gameplay, the game feels right, the game world can be very dynamic. Vehicals and Weapons is what really makes the game here. There are over 300 weapons (including Variations) and 80 Vehicles. The Vehicles handle nicely, and weapons feel authentic, except for the gunfire sounds. Squad interaction and Commanding is a big thing in the game, and it works very well, the AI will move stealthily, hide, and ambush on your command. Moving on, The Graphics are nothing spectacular, but they are not bad either, mostly the textures and lighting are a bit dodgy. Another problem is that the game is not very well optimised, so AA and ATOC will drop your frame rate by a lot unless you have a high end card. Apart from those issues, the graphics are okay. There is a campaign in the game, however, it is seldom played through to my knowledge. But the campaign is solid, nothing special to it, and not to forget that the voice acting is quite frankly, terrible. Finally, the main reason to why people love this game, is the Multiplayer. Servers can handle up to 100+ players, and many of these servers often have an emphasis on millitary simulation, so you have the full package; Real tactics, Radio Chatter, and team play. The multiplayer world is also a bit unforgiving, as it can happen that you play for 20 minutes and not encounter a single enemy, and as soon as you encounter your eney, he kills you in one shot. well, such is warfare. I recommend this game to millitary enthusiats and people who want to play a realistic team based gameGameplay: 9/10Campaign: 5/10Graphics:   6/10Multiplayer: 10/10P.S There are thousands of mods for this game			"

												""dayz mod is amazing.game itself is also great once you learn the mechanics."" Heh, that was from 2012, wow.I picked up ARMA II primarily for the DayZ mod, which I kept hearing about on reddit. I eventually watched numerous gameplay videos of it and was captivated by the idea.Later, when I decided to try the rest of the game, I realized how amazing it was, the attention to detail was absolutely remarkable.If you like combat/army simulators (that's simulation, so you aren't going to be running around like in Call of Duty destroying everyone by yourself arcade-stylle), intense squad-based gameplay, realistic combat (bullet drop, zeroing your sights, etc), and challenging gameplay, then you will love ARMA II.The aesthetics are fantastic, so much so that you are strongly advised to run the benchmark missions (yes, it comes with benchmark missions) to see how it will run on your PC, and during different scenarios (moving, firefights, explosions, etc). The music and sounds are stellar - with enough practice, you can actually tell what type of weapon was fired, and the approximate distance. You'll even be able to differentiate the different model types with enough experience.The controls take some time to get used to. You do a lot of micromanaging with your mouse - to refill ammo you will need to open your backpack then manually chamber the new magazine. Pack management is grid based, so you will need to make sure that each item actually fits into your pack. The learning curve is moderate to very difficult if you are not familiar with combat/war simulators, and playing the tutorials is strongly advised (if not mandatory) if you expect to understand how to play the game.The gameplay is incredible! Mod support is very strong, and I recommend you check out the available selection for the particular mods that fit with the playstyle you desire (many make the game even more realistic, as if it weren't realistic enough). There are vehicles you can use, and many intro missions allow you to test the different factions, vehicles, and equipment. The story is pretty good, with lots of variety in free missions. There is a mission I play over and over again that is extremely expansive - you are tasked with taking over the majority of the map. As commander of the mission, you can build structures (like more barracks, weapon emplacements) and hire reinforcements (purchase vehicles, recruit snipers, commando teams) to help you achieve your goal. As you succeed in liberating different areas, you will be awarded with more cash.The reason why I play this mission over and over again is because it is really fun and there are countless ways for you to proceed through the mission (you can attack different areas, and with different army set ups). Another reason why I play this particular mission over and over again is because I keep dying by the second major firefight I get into. The game is extremely challenging, even for seasoned gamers.Overall, if you like difficult scenarios and realistic combat, you must give this game a chance. The DayZ mod is a nice bonus.

												Best tactical shooter/simulation I've ever played. I feel its an easy 9/10. It does require a bit of a learning curve. Once you've mastered that however, its amazing. It gets better every time I play. Personally, my favorite mode is the Invasion 1944 mod. DayZ is another really good mod for this game also.			"

												In my opinion, Arma 2 in General is an amazing game, and the graphics are insane considering it's age and comparisions with other games from 2010, even compared with some games recently released, this game is SUPERIOR. I've been playing it for over a year, and it's never the same, no matter what i'm doing. 10/10			"

												ArmA 2 is well known for it's popular mod called Dayz. But I tell you what. Dayz is fun but ArmA 2 is even more fun. Ofcourse when you will start the game you will find that this game isnt just shoot and run type of game, its more about tactics and your teamates. There aren't many servers of Arma 2 since most of them are Dayz servers but if you'll look more carefully you will find servers like Wasteland, Warfare BE, Domination, Insurgency and Island life servers. So when you get use yo the game I would recommend joining game community since they can offer you even more fun! And if you like going solo then don't worry ArmA 2 campaign is fun too! Also ArmA 2 community has to offer alot of custom maps, weapons, vehicles, scenarios, campaigns... And if you like to edit well than you can do it too! And its not that hard to learn using since there a lot of scripts and tutorials how to use editor. To sum up, you should buy this game you wount regret it!			"

												Arma 2 OA is a great game all around. It's a bit buggy, and the graphics are not exactly stunning, but it is realistic and fun, if you know where to look. The Level Editor is fun to mess around with (think 500 vehicles and helis and planes fighting in a desert filled with chickens) and the single missions (scenarios) contain lots of content, too. The campaigns are lengthy and are diverse. Downloadable content is available, adding even more replayability. Of course, you can't forget that the DayZ Mod requires Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA. The multiplayer is largely unused, since DayZ is what the large majority of the players do with Arma 2. I would highly recommend this to anyone with any sort of FPS interests, and especially if you are interested in zombies games, due to the DayZ mod			"

												I played OFP ( still do ) for hours and hours, online, offline, modded or Vanilla. Back in those days i was amazed by the immersion and realism ( as in how hard it actually is to hit targets while running for your life ) and the well though off storyline. Then came ARMA ( still play that too ) and ARMA II and graphics improved, AI got better and a whole new world opened with addons like ACE and a diversity of vehicles and units ( even our proud Dutch army is modded...wich makes me proud as i served there for 15 years ). So, the Pro's :Modding is almost endless...annything you might want, it's there...It looks and feels nice, but on older systems you will have to trade looks for performance because it's a heavy game!Con's :The campaign is virtually unplayable, buggs and triggers / scripts that don't work can make your game feel incomplete.It's NOT an ARCADE type, Battlefield, COD shooter...there's a steep learning curve for firsttimers.Conclusion :Is it worth buying?

												I haven't played too much just yet, but I definitely can see that this is an amazing game, quite nicely replicating that military feel. Get ambushed, prepare an ambush, drop support, rain hail after hail of artillery shells, build a base, buy tons of weapons, tons of units, explore massive maps, work as a team with your allies, and face brutal and sudden deaths. Fly attack helicopters, get rammed while flying by another plane/heli, drive a tank, command massive squads, snipe and firefight all with realistic bullet drop, and more. Go nightvision, parachute out of a plane, get pinned down, run out of ammo, get utterly slaughtered. 15/10 Role-Playable-good and spot on.You'll find the best experience on an up-to-date computer with decent performance characteristics.

												I originally bought the game just to play DayZ Epoch, which I can say I loved...I really had no interest in another military first person shooter, I already played enough, the Battlefield series (Great series) , Medal of Honor (Good series) , America's Army (O.K.) and Call of Duty series (Garbage), I know all you CoD fan-boys will hate me for that, but in my opinion it went down hill after Call of Duty 2 . Then the DayZ Epoch server I played on shut down, shortly there after my friend who got me playing, stop playing and went on to other games, and my Arma 2 collections sat un-played.From time to time I would try other DayZ mods and servers, most filled with jerks and hackers...Then I discovered DaiZy a single player mod of DayZ, I started playing again and trying some of the different DaiZy mods available, I was having fun again...that lead to finding other mods for the Arma 2 collection like Day of Survival and a host of others...Now I play DaiZy, DoS and the actual game and I love it.I have to say it's the Best Military First Person Shooter I have ever played, and with all the different mods out there for it and the ability to edit your own missions it has a ton of re-play value!I highly recommend buying the whole Arma 2 collection if you want a in depth Military First Person Shooter with a ton of different way to play!

												I reccommend this game, so long as you buy it in conjunction with the base Arma 2, DayZ is a huge entertainment plaza and even other mods like ACE ect. Time'll pass by relatively quickly when playing and even the story is an interesting take, quite obviously not award winning but certainly getting up there, you won't get much connection to it but it's definitely something worth picking up if you have a spare tenner at hand.

												The Battle for Lopez“Dammit Vbud don’t start the engine! Wait for everyone to get in.” Jesus, the waiting is killing me I thought as the engine puttered and choked back to sleep. Sitting inside the hot and cramped M113 armored personnel carrier I was patiently waiting for everyone to get ready. To my 2 o’clock a tall warehouse rests no more than 500 meters away. Nearby are small adobe huts and a few other scattered buildings. In the middle of it all is a derelict gas station. Over my shoulder I see Kilo and Tangible get out onto an open field. They walk to the left in front of my M113.“Alright ground team you all ready?”“Ready!”“Yup!”“What about you Billy?”Billy close to the palm tree forest yells out,“Yeah I’m here.”“Ok let’s get moving.”Maj. Kilo is leading the ground team while Ice and I are on standby with the M113s. The ground team consists of Kilo, Tangible, and Zer∅, with support from Billy and Jack. The ground team walked on an exposed dirt pathway to the warehouse. Kilo taking the lead, they inserted through the front garage and started clearing the building. I heard shots fired behind me and turned around to see the support squad under fire. I watched as Billy rolled on the ground to dodge bullets. With each round nearly missing I could see small plumes of dirt flying through the air. I looked toward the enemy base seeing tracers fly out window. Returning my eyes to the support squad I see Billy’s dead body lay on the ground. Bleeding, his head lay in the dirt blood seeping through his thick camouflage. Jack quickly sprints into Ice’s APC and closes the hatch. This is no time to mourn our lost brother, we have to find the shooter. Silence.Silence. The only sounds I hear are the chirping of the birds in the nearby jungle. I’m just sitting here looking. Looking to find the killer. I shout out,“Hey I think I see something on the top of that hill. Its at my 11 o’clock.”Ice replies, “I can’t see that way its behind me.”Jack says, “I can, I’m lookin’.”One minute passes, two minutes, three.“Hey I see someone, yeah I see someone he’s running down the hill!”. Jack shouts!“I don’t see anyone. Where is he?”“He’s right there! On the left side!”“I see him I’m going after him!”“Wait Vbud.”“Come on he’s right there!”I feel like a dog on a leash seeing a cat for the first time. I rev the engine and get ready to plow straight through him!“Vbud go get him!” Kilo says, relieving me of my building excitement I charge at him full speed, while listening to the chirps and chimes of 7.7 rifle rounds deflecting off the M113s frontal armor. I fly across the grassy field, careful not to hit the sparse but clustered palm trees. The enemy runs away as he realizes his mistake. He dodges to my right side. I slow and turn my vehicle around a large tree. I catch him getting back up from his futile attempt to evade revenge. Calmly, I throttle up and watch his body slowly disappear out of view.“Thud”“I got him!”“Alright nice.”Now, I don’t remember what happened in between Ice and I rushing towards the enemy base, but I do remember Ice shouting,“What the ♥♥♥♥! I’m hit!”“Ice come on get out of there!” I say rushing towards him.I drive up to about five meters from his M113. I hear a “Fwoomph” then an explosion. I watch as Ice’s M113 bursts into flames. The fire burning the paint and its victim inside. It must have hit a fuel line I think to myself as I call out again, “Ice get out!” Then I realize if they can destroy an M113 they can destroy me too. Once again my focus must change from mourning the loss of one of my best friends to not becoming one of those losses as well. I quickly turn right and make my way out of there. To save my♥♥♥♥♥and an expensive piece of equipment. They must have run out of 203 grenades because they started firing rifles at me. I was still a little worried but felt better knowing I was safe inside the thick armor of the M113. Drip, drip, drip. Red liquid runs down my face like wine. Dark red blood flowing from my head has covered the dashboard. Cleaning off the blood I realize the throttle is maxed out and that I’m slowly spinning in circles. The left track must have gone out. Facing the warehouse I quickly reverse and spin myself towards a road leading west away from the warehouse. Fighting the drag of the left track I pull the wheel to turn the M113 left and right to wiggle just a few inches of distance between me and the warehouse.For 15 grueling minutes I slowly crawl the M113 towards a small row of houses. Bleeding out, I feel my hands and my feet getting colder. I watch as the color of the grass becomes more pale. The vibrant and vivid greens and blues slowly fade on to cold colorless grays. Like an overcast sky on what would have been a sunny day. As I feel my body slow down, I also slow down the M113 and park it next to the only semi-standing building within the area. Half of the living room has caved in on itself and I can see through to the kitchen. I attempt to park the M113 by the house, but I end up just hitting the tracks against some rubble.

I briefly mourn the loss of my good friends Ice and Billy, and then grab my radio and call to Kilo, “Vbud here, ready for extraction.”			"

												This game is arguably the best Military Simulation I have ever played. It has it all - a fantastic campaign, fun scenarios/missions(think spec ops from MW2, but on a larger scale), and Multiplayer. I would definitely recommend getting this game if are a fan of Fps/Mil sim games.			"

												Arma 2 OA is a great game all around. It's a bit buggy, and the graphics are not exactly stunning, but it is realistic and fun, if you know where to look. The Level Editor is fun to mess around with (think 500 vehicles and helis and planes fighting in a desert filled with chickens) and the single missions (scenarios) contain lots of content, too. The campaigns are lengthy and are diverse. Downloadable content is available, adding even more replayability. Of course, you can't forget that the DayZ Mod requires Arma 2 and Arma 2 OA. The multiplayer is largely unused, since DayZ is what the large majority of the players do with Arma 2. I would highly recommend this to anyone with any sort of FPS interests, and especially if you are interested in zombies games, due to the DayZ mod			"

This may not be the game for you if you're not the kind of person who likes to download mod and play on multiplayer servers. The Dayz Mod and Island life Mod are great except for the drama that occurs on the communities but other than that its awesome. Long story short:Pros:-great graphics-great gameplay(Multiplayer driven)-Many endings to the campaign based on decisionscons:-Other than multiplayer there isn't much purpose to get the game-Very prone to crash on packed servers(with weak PC) lag is to be expected regardless of computer specs			"

												Had the best multiplayer experience with this game a few years ago.I was hopping through servers when I chanced upon a SERIOUS server. As soon as I logged in, a guy told me to immediately head to the chopper and I will be briefed while in the air. When the chopper took off, the mission details were given to us through voice chat. I was assigned to the sniper group and was told to follow the point man.The helicopter dropped our group off a hill near the target location. Drop off was fast, as soon as the last person from our group got off, the chopper immediately lifted off to take other teams to their designated position.So we were there by the hill watching the other group enter the target area through our scopes. I can hear people coordinating through voice chat, barking orders in hushed tones. I was there watching from afar as they slowly sweep through the area. The air was tense and I tried my best to stay vigilant watching out for any hostiles.After a while of this. We were informed that the mission was a success. Turns out there were no hostiles in the area but the mission objective (To clear the area) was a success. It may seem like an uneventful mission. But I was at the edge of my seat the whole time.Good times.			"

												Pros:Ultra-Realistic Combat when playing with the right people. Resembles helmet-cam combat footage from Iraq.Higher Settings = better FPS for some people, somehow. Realistic sounds and visuals. Realistic uniforms and diversity in different militaries around the world. A bright and creative modding community. Class diversity. Cons:Few available servers. 90% Modded servers (Lookin at you DayZ) Occasional bad FPSNearly Pointless classesThe opportunity to Run & Gun COD-style is still present. Lack of variety in weapons (made up for by the detail and variety in types of weapons. Example: About 13 different Ak's)You bought Arma II? Congrats! Allow us to announce that you now must purchas Operation Arrowhead to play online. All-in-all, a great combat simulator. Not recommended for casual players.			"

												Greetings Traveler,You have now come upon a game review by the Greatest DayZ player in Asia.Today I will be covering the game (mod) Arma II: DayZ Mod. If you haven't heard of DayZ before, well, you should crawl out of your cave.. Back to the point(!): DayZ is a game mod that was made to be based on Zombie Survival, but as players are able to kill each other, and zombie way too easy to escape or kill, it became a PvP game.DayZ is extremely fun due to the detailed and rich gameplay possibilities - The graphics are nice, the amount of cool and different loot is extreme, the fact that you can choose to play ""deathmatch"" or strategic on ONE server, the size of the map is enormous, and much, much more.This game is fun to play alone, in a small group, and in a big squad, though I do recommend learning the game with someone else.PS: FPS is no problem in this game. My 6 years old computer does 40-60 fps (anything over 30 fps will make the game 100% smooth.)I'd like my Steam EXP, Valve. {-:>			"

												Writing this post DayZ SA release. I get the feeling that the mod will be popular for a good while yet since the standalone just isn't quite there yet and people enjoy mods like Epoch and things the SA doesn't have so there's that still. Apart from that, the game is amazing. It has a steep learning curve but if you can stick with it and get past that, the game is too good. The map(s) are huge and Chernarus in particular is something special. The amount of different game modes (excluding DayZ variations) is enough to keep you playing for many hundreds, possibly thousands of hours. Game modes go from small 8 player missions to massive 100+ servers / missions. I'm really♥♥♥♥♥♥at trying to say why this is good but there's an attempt.			"

												Very great game if you like War. It's very awesome that the game has Autopilot Landing. Helps to land a lot.The guns and phsyics are pretty good.The planes don't have very good physics at all. In fact, the plane physics suck and it's the thing I hate the most about this game. If you are taking off, and you barely touch a car or helicopter (that is on the right of the runway) with your wing, your plane will just turn to the right and be stuck until the server restarts or your reset your singleplayer world.It is pretty fun to mess around in the Editor.Driving with cars, is very awesome. It's one of the things I love to do most when I'm bored. The camera movement is pretty realistic. I love it.The running looks pretty dumb, to be honest. Jumping is not so bad, but the only problem is that there is only one way that he jumps. Very well made game. I like it a lot.			"

												After being a fan favorite, from my early childhood, this game has truly tested time.With amazing sounds, graphics, and combat, it felt too real for 2010. From the aminious forests and valleys in the northern sectors, to the barren fields where you expect an entire army to start firing at you, this game immerses and involves you.As well, as being home to coop domination, team deathmatch, and more, Arma 2/Arma 2 OA brought and sustained one of its best, FREE, modded expansionsDrumroll please.........DAYZ!Featuring a new way to play, with scavenging, surviving and adapting, Dayz brought a whole new aspect to the Arma environment. Whereas before, you would ignore enemy weapons, explosives and clothing, you now needed to loot and make sure you had enough bullets, food and supplies for any situation...Whereas before, you'd be dissapointed you'd died, and have to respawn at base or restart the mission, Dayz stressed, and panicked you. If you died, you would probably lose your gear forever, lost in the Coyote Backpack of that ghilie bandit at Sniper Hill. Additionally, the game branched out and expanded tremendously out of Vanilla Dayz.Modders added bases (my favorite), new guns/sounds, new maps, new vehicles, a new economy system, and SO MUCH MORE!If a game truly has the best modding community, it's Arma.I hope, that Bohemia continues to create and enhance the Arma experience, in future installments and updates, fixing glitches and annoyances, like physics, destruction, medical treatments, and more.But if you can get a group of 2-3 friends, get in a group chat, and load up this game, it will amaze you with a brilliantly crafted, Tactial masterpiece.Arma 2/ Arma 2 OA: 9.5/10			"

												This game is amazing. It still has many bugs like glitchy atvs and the multiplayer screen crashes a lot. But its still worth its money. I will give a little log of my first takistan life as an independent. We had a group of 4 people.1. We get DksHm armored car and start our drive to Rasman.2. We encounter a pmc patrol. losses: 13. We get to rasman and leave a after there being a report of a large pmc group in the area.4. North Takistan is declared to be under martial law.5. We drive to the bank on the west edge of rasman.6. We wait till night and rob the bank.7. While we are robbing bank we are ambushed by pmcs. losses: 2 (including me)8. The last man tries to run but gets ambushed again by an army partrol.			"

												If you have patience then yes I would recomend this game, the reason you need patience is because this game is slow paced at times. And yes this is a military simulator!You could also look at playing one of the many roleplay or other mods for Arma 2 OA.Personally I have used most of my Arma 2 OA hours playing ""Takistan Life"" and ""Island Life"".There is so many possibiltys of things you can do.I hope you can will and have had as much fun, as I know I have and will continue to have on this great game.

												First off, this game is one of the greatest experiences I've had on PC since I got into Steam a few years ago.  The development, game play, realism, and everything about this game just makes it a great milsim, whether hardcore or amateur.  This is a great way to experience realistic combat in a danger-filled middle eastern theater environment.  Anyone looking to get into milsims, or just want to learn about true combat the way it is should DEFINITELY consider this game as something to have in your library.			"

On this realistic game u can get killed by furniture, Ride a bike with a broken leg and the usual get launched into oblivion when someone rams u in a safezone on dayz probably the only reason why i got the game. But i suppose wastelands fun to, Deploying from the sky when the parachute doesnt work. Headplanting into someone.

												Very great game if you like War. It's very awesome that the game has Autopilot Landing. Helps to land a lot.The guns and phsyics are pretty good.The planes don't have very good physics at all. In fact, the plane physics suck and it's the thing I hate the most about this game. If you are taking off, and you barely touch a car or helicopter (that is on the right of the runway) with your wing, your plane will just turn to the right and be stuck until the server restarts or your reset your singleplayer world.It is pretty fun to mess around in the Editor.Driving with cars, is very awesome. It's one of the things I love to do most when I'm bored. The camera movement is pretty realistic. I love it.The running looks pretty dumb, to be honest. Jumping is not so bad, but the only problem is that there is only one way that he jumps. Very well made game. I like it a lot.			"

Realistic sounds and visuals. Realistic uniforms and diversity in different militaries around the world. A bright and creative modding community. Class diversity. Cons:Few available servers. 90% Modded servers (Lookin at you DayZ) Occasional bad FPSNearly Pointless classesThe opportunity to Run & Gun COD-style is still present. Lack of variety in weapons (made up for by the detail and variety in types of weapons. Example: About 13 different Ak's)You bought Arma II? Congrats! Allow us to announce that you now must purchas Operation Arrowhead to play online. All-in-all, a great combat simulator. Not recommended for casual players.			"

												A fun, innovative and easy game to wrap-around, Since my purchase of the bundle years back, i have never regreted buying the games, they are accurate in both their NATO codes and military combat, no matter what senario i have made or played, i was amazed by it's level of detail and customizability, I reccomend to those who love military-based games and battle simulators, It's a must!

												While most people buy this and ARMA 2 for the DayZ mod, I bought this for its Campaign and Singleplayer. ARMA 2 Operation Arrowhead and its expansions provide some of the best singleplayer missions ever to be seen, especially ARMA 2 Private Military Company. Get this game even if you arent a ARMA fan, it is just that this game is a brilliant addition to the millitary shooter genre.			"

												Played DayZ mod. I was quietly going to meet up with my friend on my bicycle when two guys stopped with their car right beside me and started shooting at me. Killed them both with a makarov and one magazine. Survived 5 bullets, stole their equipement, got up in their car and met up with my friend. They whined and called me a cheater for 10 mins.10/10, would f*ck up players again.			"

												TL;DR Score: 8.4/10Quick Review: Unable to give a full review as all i played on was DayZ mod with friends, however im giving it a thumbs up JUST for that, massive map, good replayability (online), even better with friends.Pros:» DayZ mod and many more game modes.» good graphics for the time it was made.Cons:» feels like my character is unable to follow simple ""turn the ♥♥♥♥ around"" orders sometimes.Main Review: unable to give a good general review due to only playing 1 game mode on game, but i know it has many game modes, hence the thumbs up however i doubt ill be playing any others since Arma 3 is out, however just for the DayZ mod (outdated, DayZ standalone is out, but highly unpolished) im giving it a good score and thumps up since it was a good take on a zombie appocalypse world and scavanging, hell it has cars too, making the trek across the massive map much more quicker. Good fun with friends, some BS shots by other players, but its anti-cheat is good, one of the best actually. i dont know if i should recommend to buy now since Arma 3 and DayZ standalone (unpolished) is out now, but it was good for its time.Any Updated Review:			"

												Arma 2 Is really an different ''shooter'' Well it's really a Military Sim. But it does have quite a bunch of hilarious bugs that makes it silly as well, it isn't all that serious, so don't be afraid of the ''Simulator'' part. Multiplayer still works despite gamespy's demise, since all the servers are now on Steam. There are lots of players still online and you are guaranteed to find a game for pretty much any mission or mode. There are loads of mission editor and modding possibilities, if you are into that. You can be either a soldier on the field or someone all the way up in the high command, giving orders for a whole army of units. Bullet ballistics are present and I can tell that sniping is satisfying and unforgiving if you happen to miss a shot. Bullet damage is quite high, so except to die fast if you get hit anywhere from the waist up.The thing I really don't like is the somewhat poor optimization. But you can get the game to run better, if you just modify a couple of text files. Still chernarus and other maps with dense forest are quite heavy on your PC. But maps like Takistan with less trees run very well. Also Desync is sometimes present if the server has been on for a long time. So you can shoot first and still die, if the server has been on for a long time. So you should check the Up Time if possible.All in all I recommend the game, although the 20€ price tag for both OA and the vanilla game is a tad bit high I think for such a ''old'' game. So perhaps you should wait for a sale, maybe not. It's really your own preference.			"

												This is a game for serious gamers. It's about the tension of being put into the most realistical combat situation virtual reality can provide. It's also about the immertion of playing in teams and coordinate with each other to achieve result. In this you are part of something greater and it's one of the rare game that may make you freak out from being left alone with your team down.This game also provide the tool for creative people to let their mission creation skill go wild and turn the game into one of the most replayable game ever. This aspect is largely due to the openess of the environement that offer you a large scale map where you can use the path you want with the means you have.Having played many games I can say that most good games are fun for a while and then you never touch them again, but you always go back to arma series. This game doesn't get old and it's very active and talented moding community insure that it will remain this way for a long time.			"

												The Battle of Jerusalem occurred during the British Empire's ""Jerusalem Operations"" against the Ottoman Empire, when fighting for the city developed from 17 November, continuing after the surrender until 30 December 1917, to secure the final objective of the Southern Palestine Offensive during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign of World War I. Before Jerusalem could be secured, two battles were recognised by the British as being fought in the Judean Hills to the north and east of the Hebron–Junction Station line. These were the Battle of Nebi Samwill from 17 to 24 November and the Defence of Jerusalem from 26 to 30 December 1917. They also recognised within these Jerusalem Operations, the successful second attempt on 21 and 22 December 1917 to advance across the Nahr el Auja, as the Battle of Jaffa, although Jaffa had been occupied as a consequence of the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 16 November.[1]This series of battles was successfully fought by the British Empire's XX Corps, XXI Corps, and the Desert Mounted Corps against strong opposition from the Yildirim Army Group's Seventh Army in the Judean Hills and the Eighth Army north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast. The loss of Jaffa and Jerusalem, together with the loss of 50 miles (80 km) of territory during the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) advance from Gaza, after the capture of Beersheba, Gaza, Hareira and Sheria, Tel el Khuweilfe and the Battle of Mughar Ridge, constituted a grave setback for the Ottoman Army and the Ottoman Empire.[2]As a result of these victories, British Empire forces captured Jerusalem and established a new strategically strong fortified line. This line ran from well to the north of Jaffa on the maritime plain, across the Judean Hills to Bireh north of Jerusalem, and continued eastwards of the Mount of Olives. With the capture of the road from Beersheba to Jerusalem via Hebron and Bethlehem, together with substantial Ottoman territory south of Jerusalem, the city was secured. On 11 December, General Edmund Allenby humbly entered the Old City on foot through the Jaffa Gate instead of horse or vehicles to show respect for the holy city. He was the first Christian in many centuries to control Jerusalem, which is a very important site for many faiths. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George described the capture as ""a Christmas present for the British people"". The battle was a great morale boost for the British Empire.[3]			"

												I would have left this review in DayZ mod, but according to Steam, I've never played DayZ so it wouldn't let me leave a review there. I only got Arma 2 to play DayZ. Since I've started playing DayZ, I've been hooked ever since. It was a little bit of a pain in the azz to get it all setup my first time, but once I did, it was worth it. Despite all the bugs, I do find DayZ to be a good game. When I first started, I played in PVE (Epoch) servers. No PVP is allowed in PVE servers. It gave me a chance to grasp the game without being interupted by other players. Then once I grasped the game enough, I wondered off to the PVP servers. Starting out that way might be best for you (or not), just thought I would suggest it.Yeah, it has its buggy moments -  it's still an awesome game... yes, this is coming from a DayZ-holic so take this as you will. :D			"

												Great addition to the franchise. What can I sayThis is a game for mature gamers.The graphics:The game is beautiful.  Its good to see that they finally optimized the engine. I know some may complain about the ""bland"" look of the engine, but hey, that what the world looks like, I think this engine truly displays ""reality"" so to speak better than all the other engines (the Crytek engine is a bit cartoonish for my taste). This is a simulation after all, let's not let COD boys downplay this game and compare it to 2009's biggest run and shoot scam in video game history.Whats great about the graphics, especially the visibility option, is that even if you set your visibility to low, 1-2 Kilometers, you'd still be able to see the beautiful landscape in the far background, unlike in Arma 2, where the far-stretched landscape disappeared as soon as you lowered your visibility. Here, you'll be able to enjoy the far horizons, hills and mountains - really makes you feel like you're in mid-Asia mountain valley.They've also added the hot-air effect now, a sort of desert mirage sort of wavy screen.This game is for PATIENT And MATURE players only, and I rejoice at the fact that it's a PC exclusive.So anyway. The story is decent enough. Typical American liberation of some CIA installed dictatorship in Mid-Asia I guess. What's weird is that if you play on ""Regular"" some enemies (i.e. Fundamentalist Muslims) surrender easily. Now here, you can actually kill these POW's without any repercussions. However, killing civilians is a no-no. You get to make big game-altering choices just like in the first two games. It's interesting to see hostiles using old Soviet weaponry and vehicles. You could also encounter some old destroyed weaponry in the countryside, probably from previous conflicts.The game play.It's pretty much the same game play as in the first two Arma's. You can roll over now while in prone position. Also, there's a sort of notoriety meter. Its there to ensure that you don't impose your overt American imperialistic aggression on the indigenous population and their property. There's the usual slight general cumbersomeness in moving about, just like in real life, I guess. What's also great is that you aren't tied down to your squad again. I mean it was fun to run around with your buddies in the first two games and kick some a$$. But we know that if one of them died then it was mission over. This time, you are much more free to run around and approach your targets from any direction. In Arma 2 I liked the fact that you played as a black man. In Operation Arrowhead you play as Ben Herrera - probly a Hispanic. So Bohemia Interactive is pretty liberal and reformative I'd have to say. Also, the overall terrain is much more maneuver friendly. But it's not like I didn't enjoy running around the 400 square km of forest in Arma 2.The bad:There are still bugs there and there. The enemies disappear and then appear behind your back. The shot up glass windows are really messed up, how could the mess that up? Sometimes, it takes the engine a few seconds to render vehicles correctly. For instance, the wheels are squared before they turn round. Sometimes it takes an extra second for enemies to die after the grenade blast. Also, I'd really like it if the overall physics was improved. Some textures are messed up. Like you can just walk into big rocks and stay inside them.On a personal note, it's a shame that games like these always get overshadowed by big COD types of blockbusters.Anyways, it's good to know that there are still good games out there that aren't marred and watered down for the consoles.

												To start, Arma is a military simulation game, not a zombie apocolypse or RP game.Its a great game, especially when you play the proper game modes and play with the military RP your supposed to use. 8/8 m8 its gr8			"

												If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.Eat.			"

												-Played Wasteland on Utes.-was killing some skrubs around me-found a casual with 10K on him-contact me m9ys about money, decide go a bus-accidentally buy a T-72-m9y's think it's a bus, so just roll with it-get in, guns 4/20 blazin it all over-shoot kid out of sky on parachute, body flies by with his last words ""stupid idiots""-rekt server for about 2 hours running around killing anyone that was moving, or not moving-10/10 would use heavy armor against infantry all over the map againI would recommend the game, even though Arma 3 has more features because of recent updates, the multiplayer on here is the greatest thing ever. Wasteland is a blast, you have every variant of DayZ, and you can just have fun with friends on private servers. Recommended to everyone who enjoys shooters.			"
