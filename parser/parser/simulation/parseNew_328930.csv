												One of the most important 90's flight-sims, created by one of the most important 90's flight-sim studios.  F-14:FD is a study sim of said bird, with moderate-to-high complexity, particularly in the AWG-9 radar modelling and carrier landings.  It was one of the benchmark simulations of its day (hard to believe that was 20 years ago as of this writing... where does the time go?) and while the sim's graphics are certainly a smeary, muddy 320x200 mess, the underlying game still holds up well.  There's a campaign mode (blow the filthy Commie Scum out of the North Atlantic), scramble (quick mission builder) mode, and even a full mission builder.  Some caveats:  first, this is a DOS game, running under DOSBox.  I'm not sure if Night Dive Studios made any additional modifcations to the sim other than DOSBox settings, but I know from past experience that FD behaves well under DOSBox so there isn't any problem there.  Still, you'll need to understand and futz with DOSBox settings if you want your joystick throttle to work.  Second: this is a complex simulation, not a kick-the-tires-and-light-the-fires kind of deal.  You will want to read the (hefty) game manual, and you need to understand that you're taking the role of TWO people in the Tomcat -- both the pilot and the RIO.  The workload wasn't everyone's bag of tea even back in the 90's, when simheads were two-fisted men of iron and tobacco spit.So should you, the reader, buy this game?YES if you are deeply interested in how the (now-retired) Tomcat worked and fought, and don't mind aged (yet somehow still compelling) graphics.  There will probably never be a better Turkey sim than this one.NO if ancient textured polygons bother you, or you're not interested in a simulation more complex than War Thunder.  Or are an Eagle pilot, which means you have other problems that nobody can help you with :)			"

												It is a serious simulator(the manual is inlcuded, it has 123 pages), and I am sure that at that time it was mindblowing. Sadly I was born only 7 days before the release, so I didn't get a chance to enjoy it until now.It is a great sim and even today you can get quite a bit of entertaining out of it, while you wait for Leatherneck Simulations to release the F-14 for DCS :PA couple of things you should know. This is abandonware, that means that the company that did this doesn't exist anymore(in fact it doesn't exist since 1999). So that means there is no support and that you can get this for free on most abandonware pages, and run it with DosBox. Yes, the Steam version also runs with DosBox, and also allows you to run it with JukeBox.Second thing is that if you don't have a US keyboard you are going to have problems with a couple of functions, like the throttle or switching to the RIO seat. There is a fix for this: editing the DosBox config file inside the game folder, line 232, change from ""keyboardlayout=auto"" ""to keyboardlayout=us"" and setting your windows keyboard to US, that way you can get it working.Considering those 2 things mentioned, 7â‚¬ is overpriced, I wouldn't pay that much for an abandonware that has problems with non-US keyboards. The good thing is that these games go on sale very often and you can get it for a 75% or 90% disctount, in that case, you should get it. Having it on Steam instead of in a dosfile downloaded from a webpage gives you a guarantee that as long Steam is alive, you will be able to play this without depending on abandonware websites or torrents			"

												I remember when this game was released I was in high school fascinated with airplanes in general and Tomcats in particular. The game was a must for me if only for the single reason that F-14 was the main hero here. But I was not able to adequately appreciate the game back in those days. I took it as just next flight sim out there (I remind you those were the days when you could have had three flight sims for a penny) just with a lovely F-14 models.When I bought it as a re-release from steam I learned how much I had been missing. Although the game could use better gfx (models aren't very detailed I must admit; the tomcats are ""boosted"" with pretty detailed textures but opponents' looks just suck), the whole experience of ""weapon delivery platform"", as the manual says, is unsurpassed. It's not a simple dogfight sim (although it can be played as such in Scramble mode). It's a simulator of a much more complicated concept - an interceptor pair.Most fun for me in this game comes from working as both pilot and - often overlooked in other games featuring F-14 - RIO (Radar Intercept Officer). The game features a very good simulation of AWG-9 radar and targeting system and puts you in charge of operating it to seek and destroy your targets. Of course, you may set your difficulity level to simple and just fly around and shoot your missiles (or even turn on training mode, reload your missiles in mid air and play a ""fighter gunboat"" ;->) but you'll miss half of the fun. The better half.I only wish someone would release similar game nowadays using full potential of conteporary computers.(Oh, and don't mind my 0,7 hours played - I copied the game out and run it with dosbox on my linux laptop :-D)			"

												One of the best flight sims of the 90's.I have fond memories of playing this as a teenager.Bro was also into the complex operations of the Radar Intercept Officer's back seat operations. Although I disabled these and flew it in more an arcade mode.Fond memories of hunting down Russian Badger bombers launching cruise missiles at the carrier. Losing it means you only have the ocean to land in.Running out of fuel and trying to glide back to the carrier for a landing.Having to intercept an Unidentified Flying Object and having to try to shoot it down.Doing TARPS missions and having to fly directly over hostile bases.Skipping through the aircraft in the game and watching the dragon fly around (or UFO) =P.The game featured a branching campaign like Wing Commander, lose the initiative and you'll end up on missions protecting your carrier from enemy assaults. Too many failures and your task group will have to make a strategic withdrawl.The squadron selection was a nice touch as you get to see the insignia on your plane.The game is perfectly flyable with a keyboard, not something you can do these days.This used an updated version of the 1942 Pacific Air War engine, which wasn't surpassed in graphics until around 2000. I spent hours staring at the models.Great game.			"

												To the best of my knowlidge, this remains the first and only F-14 Tomcat simulator meant to give the full experience of flying the F-14 in combat.  I beleive there are some F-14s for FSX or other civilian flight sims that due a very good job, better than this simulator, of portraying the experience of flying the F-14 from the pilot's seat, but I don't think they model weapons systems.The learning curve on this simulator, as with other study sims of it's day like Falcon 3.0 and it's Hornet and MIG-29 addons, is steep for those not used to combat flight sims of this era.  Having said that, once you learn how to fly the jet and work it's systems, it's a rewarding experience.This game comes well ported for modern Windows via DosBox.  Please search the forums/community for information on how to enable the digitized speech.I wish to point out a few oddities, for those who may play:1. The AIM-54 Phoenix will only guide to a target if you first ""Designate"" a target when launching from TWS or go to Single Target Track.2. Enemy weapons loads are frequently just plain wrong.  Expect to encounter modern enemy aircraft either carrying more or longer range AAMs than they should, or strangely outdated weapons, or guns on normally gunless aircraft.			"
