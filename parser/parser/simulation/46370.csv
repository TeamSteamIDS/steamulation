												A few things that I noticed in my little gaming session, which was 30 minutes or so.- The cutscenes are just weird- There's no waypoints on the map when you start the game, so you have no idea where you need to go to- The camera views are horrible- The first person (driver) is way too close to the windshield, that makes it impossible to drive and look at the mirrors at the same time- The ""cities"" if you can even call them that, are just a few buildings here and there- I don't see the point of the Warehouse thing, why can't there just be a few companies in the cities where you could just drive to and get a trailer from there?- I went to get a trailer from Los Angeles' Warehouse but it just said ""You're 2nd"" after I chose a trailer and I didn't get a trailer behind my truck and I didn't get a waypoint on the map showing where the trailer would be at- I drove to a gas station and refueled my truck, after that, the truck just completely got stuck, it didn't move at all no matter what button I pressed on the keyboard- A ""2 of 2"" or ""1 of 2"" text in the little bar on the top of the screen, no idea what that means as there was no explanation to that- And many, many other things.This game is 14,99€ on Steam, definitely not worth it. Don't spend your money on this game.			"

												I bet this would be one of the least useful reviews, well, I don't really care:Hard Truck 2: King of the Road was my favorite game of this genre, it was all around 10/10 game, so when I saw this game on steam I was so exited because I expected the same game with better graphics and more content but what do we have:-sh`tty graphics with lags-sh`tty music-sh`tty interface and unplayable controls-rеtаrded collision physix-I know this is not helpful for English review but this describes the quality of the game a lot - produced by Russian devs @ no Russian localization - yeh its THAT hard, ikr-no steam achievements or steam cards-no any reason to buy this gameQualitywise this game is somewhere in between Lada racing club and any normal truck racing game.

												Look at this as a simulator and you'll be let down. Looking at this as a truck-themed arcade game, and you'll praise:• An amazing map - no prefabricated undersized intersections. The bespoke highways are properly scaled and a joy to drive on. You can do more than 30mph without tipping over. The map itself is huge - takes several hours to cross despite higher speeds and straighter roads than ETS• You can see your hired drivers on the road as they work, and join them in competitive jobs• A far, far, far more detailed truck diagnostics system than other games. Worn brake pads grind against the discs and degrade braking performance. Panels get beat up, the engine runs like crap.• The truck upgrade system is excellent and features things like side and rear mounted cameras to cover blind spots.• Cops (could be a con for some!)• Nice side-missions, help out hitchhikers if you want, pick up extra jobs from cafés or over the radioThat isn't to say this game is without flaws. The iffy handling and dodgy physics are geared to racing, not driving. There are competitive jobs where you are pitted against other drivers to race cargo to its destination (very unrealistic). There are also truck races and out-of-this-world missions to complete, too.In summary, don't look at it as a sim and you will be able to forgive its shortcomings. Go for a race or forgive the iffy handling and go for a really scenic drive.			"

												I like this game, it's pretty fun and doesn;t take itself very seriously at all. It's just an evolution of 18 Wheeler and Big Mutha Truckers. My only complaint is the really wobbly physics...makes sence, top heavy and all that and I found it doesn't lend well for controller or keyboard (Way too many functions to map) so maybe a steering wheel is in order.

												Remember that game on PS2 called 'Big Motha Truckers'? No? Well it's like that. This game is fun. It actually has cutscenes in which people actually talk unlike most simulators. (When was the last time you even played a ""simulator"" that even had detailed characters?) Something I enjoyed most about this game was the fact the cops come after you. I was arrested and even when being arrested there's a short cutscene. Yes, this review sucks. Boohoo. I don't care. This is a real world truck sim. Whereas Euro Truck Sim is a truck driving sim. Yes there's a difference. Play the game and you'll know what I mean.			"

I  know I have played them all.  It is that good   I drove my USA BIG truck from Los Angeles to San Diego and it looked real!  Needs Fliying J truck stops so you can pull off road, refuel and catch a nap in the sleeper watch tv radio etc. Buy this game it is the best, I am telling you.  How about r Mack trucks???

												Vice City Truck SimulatorThis game is a fun story driven truck simulator game.  Heads up the handling of the trucks is very arcade like and not realistic like ETS2.  The game looks like the PS2 GTA games and your character looks like Tommy Vercetti lol.  The game actually uses real trucks like Freightliner, Peterbilt, Kenworth, Sterling and Western Star which is a huge plus towards making the game seem realistic, just like the Shell gas stations in the game. Its an overall good game and worth buying when its on sale and at full price is worth it too if u r a truck fan.			"

												Awesome game!! It exceeded my expectations at all levels save one; the graphics performance is underwhelming. It's running at sub 60fps, not at minimum settings but even at minimum doesn't seem improve the frame rate. OK aside from performance issues, i have not encountered big bugs except in the initial stages after i had done a lot of tweakings. It randomly crashed twice while i was driving. Maybe it was due to too many changes and clicking the apply button. All is well now but with a slightly low performance as mentioned before.So what's so good about this game? Well it's more than a truck ♥♥♥ business sim; it's also has a story.Lets go over the features.1) As a truck sim there are;a) Headlightsb) Signal lightsc) Wipersd) Parking brakee) Engine brakef) Truck equipment / component upgradesg) repairs & maintenance costsh) fuel requirementi) hazard lightsj) hornk) and of course, buying more trucks and upgrading your own truck (like in Hard Truck 2)2) As a business sim there are;a) Hire & fire driversb) buying more trucksc) monitoring schedulesd) managing cash flowe) expanding business reach by adding offices in other townsf) competing with other companies (like in Hard Truck 2)3) As a story;a) a personal log of encounters along the wayb) cutscenes of your journey aka storyc) detailed animated charactersd) excellent voice actingSo what about the environment? Well it's good enough at low settings so it should be pretty impressive if maxed out. The road curves and hills are smooth, no jarring crude polygons as it once were in Hard Truck 2. No road mines either so that's a relief! Day and night cycles and weather cycles. The roads and highways, they are expansive and very impressive, at least to me. While driving from town to town there's plenty to see of the environment though some might disagree.And driving physics? Seems very good, you can see the motion of the suspension on the individual wheels. Keyboard sensitivity can be adjusted from fast to slow. So does the centering rate. These 2 settings are very useful in finding the right balance to suit individual driving preference.What about graphics and sound quality? All great! Trucks look detailed both in and out. Reflection details and rate of update can be adjusted many levels. Shadow details and viewing distance can also be adjusted many levels. Same with HDR and truck detail levels. In short all adjustable settings are graduated from 1 to 10 steps. Some settings only have on or off. It should be quite easy to find the right balance of quality and performance for any machine that meets the system requirements. Engine whirr and growl sounds real IMO. Radio stations play a wide selection of quality music. You can even add your own station like in Test Drive Unlimited.  Radio is one aspect where Rig 'n' Roll shine. You can hear up to 3 people talking in between music at random and they are rather funny & witty. What is even more amazing is the fact that the talking voices even interrupts your radio station.Final aspect, nearly neglected to mention is the brilliant AI which ties the whole game together and is nothing short of amazing. Where in most other driving or racing games, the traffic or NPC AI is either dumb or gets in the way or pops in & out of existence at random just to block your path; in this game that rarely happens, even when you're racing with other AI truckers. AI traffic & other AI truckers not participating in the same cargo run, would never get in your way unless overtaking another AI traffic which is in-front of them. Even when your're driving against the flow, the AI traffic & other AI trucks cleverly avoid head-on collision. AI seems to extend even to the radio interruptions. For example; they might talk about the need to upgrade engine when your diving rather slowly in a race. The talking voices isn't there just to lend a live effect to the stations they also talk about random events that are happening in the game. Some messages given by the radio appears in your journal as clickable entries which may include random quests. Therefore turning on the radio becomes a necessity if you want to participate in the random events.Cops are very aggressive and tenacious. It's almost impossible to lose them. If you go to a warehouse, they will follow you in or be waiting outside and continue the chase when you leave. If you refuse to stop, more cops will chase you and try to run you off the road. The resulting fines and damages to your rig can negate all rewards for the delivery or race run. So it's usually best to stop & pay-up at the first sign of a siren. Though it's possible to lose them, should they catch you later the previous fines are added to the current one. Also any accidents involving AI vehicles is deemed your fault no matter what; the cops are on a mission to give you a hard time. Never cross a yellow line in front of a cop or they will chase you to hell and back! Despite all the problems the cops can dish out, there's a neat feature called save game which can be made at any time while driving so you can immediately undo that horrible crash or wong turn you just made. ;)Game world is huge, beautiful and detailed. The lighting and reflection effects on the road when it drizzles and vehicle surfaces are impressive. It's best to look around while driving to appreciate the game world but accurate and dexterous finger work is a must to avoid crashing into objects while not looking where you are going and controlling the camera views simultaneously. This game is a big improvement over Hard Truck 2 in all aspects. Glad i bought it despite the 'Mostly Negative' rating at the time of this writing. Lastly you don't need a wheel to drive well in this game; it works just fine with a keyboard. But you'll need a high-end rig to get the most out of it. Don't miss this underrated gem; try it for yourself. I absolutely love it! 4/5 stars.http://games.dailymotion.com/video/x2j2s6g?utm_source=dailymotion&utm_medium=autopromo&utm_campaign=fromplayertogames "

I was stupid enough to spend the cash on this game and got addicted towards the game for 2 years that wasted my time that I don't even got aware of (not on Steam version... Plus, only in Russian version, you only get access to version 3.0.5 which sucks when those got access to many cool and challenging futures (I played that version also from a disc and only shown in Russian).

So overall by looking at all the other reviews noone else likes this. It is just a pile of poo.Allright, onto the serious stuffs. The graphics of this game is like a two year old has thrown some paint at it, what has the world come to? 2010 graphics... Even Half-Life 2 has better graphics (and that was made in late 2004). I didn't really understand why you can constantly smash into stuff, the damage only effects the truck visually not doing damage the engine or transmission or chassis.Now that you have read my rant, please, buy Euro truck simulator 2 or American Truck simulator (when it comes out).

												Ok, After playing ets2, I've owned like 2 disk copies of Rig N Roll, But i lost them, So I bought it really cheap again during the summer sale, GLAD I did but now realized that a few trucks in this game have been converted to ETS2 and that it is a big difference, So either save your money and dont buy this and save up for ets2 or get the first ets, I dont recommend this game1) TOO close to window, cant even see dashboard without moving your camera down2) Not the best handlingJust dont, Just dont even look at the buy button			"

												I think this game is boring, has horrible graphics, you spend a lot of time starting it and it has an bizarre thematic.I think this game costs too much. I bought it in an offer and I regret of paying those six euros.I recommend you to not buy the game. This game seems to bebetter than it is. If you want truck driving games you can find in this shop.This happed me when I played it:1-The game took a lot to start.2-The graphics were horrible.3-It's addictive.4-The thematic is too odd:      -What happens when you stop or last a lot of time for doing a job, when the police goes and cathes you is too        strange.The worst 33 minutes in my life.

												Wouldn't recommend it to people who get bored easy.. It is hard to figure out what the hell you are supposed to do(I still have no idea).. So I decided to go drive where ever lol.. Eventually I got a phone call with a shipment or something like that.. Then got a phone call from the partner or what ever that his wife is threatened outside a bar so I went to pick her up and after 5 minutes got shot(How the hell when I was far from the shooting truck) and the game ended as well as my will to try again.

												The game has a great premise: A trucking simulator with a Rock 'n Roll edge to it. Unlike Euro Truck Simulator, there is visible, physics based damage. Driving into traffic will result in the cops being called, guns drawn. The game's story mode however is archaic. The spoken dialogue slightly differs from what appears in the forced-on closed captions. There's blatant sexual tokenization of women as well from the outset with your ""footloose and fancy-free"" secretary - your character even asks ""is she married?"" From playing it on Windows 8.1, the mouse cursor doesn't move with where your mouse is on screen, which led to half an hour trying to visualize where to hover my mouse to program my non-existent game controller settings. The game needs an update to fix this rather dire issue.This game probably actually has a lot to offer, but it's not aged gracefully in both on a cultural, and technical level.			"

It's not euro-truck. But if you want to mess about in a truck for half an hour its brilliant! I bought this game in a BundleStars bundle back in 2013. I played it for 10 minutes and I hated it, it wasn't as good as Euro Truck. No realism, physics are buggy at best. However, I laughed, I laughed a lot! The police are hilarious, If you get a chance check out Mattophobia's Video where he plays the game, It gives you a brilliant representation of the game!Thanks for reading this, buy this game, but only if it costs you less than a dollar!

In some ways it is better than Hard Truck 1 & 2, and in other ways it feels like a cheap knockoff of those games.  If you've played other games from this Russian publisher, well, in my opinion they all kind of suck in one way or another and this is no exception.If this game had been released in 1999, it would have been OK as a budget title.

It's no fun, I'd rather just go back to Euro Truck Sim 2.

												Don't purchase this game if you are looking for a truck sim. Just purchase American Truck Simulator instead. If you are looking for a casual arcade style trucking/racing game with a story then I'd recommend this. The things I like about this game is that there are real truck models used for example, Kenworth, Freighliner, Peterbilt, Western Star, etc... The damage mechanics are more detailed than in ATS, and the truck interiors are also detailed. The graphics however is a major negative, but then again this game was released in 2010.			"

												Mediocre!....and with good reason. You have no idea where to go. When you get your trailer it just magically appears above and lowers down, no backing up and hitching it. The slightest bump brings the cops who have been equipped with matter transporters directly to your location. The in cab view is nuts making you think your nose is five inches from the windshield and when you try to map the commands to a controller you quickly learn you cannot map everything you need so it forces you to use keyboard as well. Biggest error of this is it will not let you use your mouse for steering such as in ETS 2 and that becomes a major killer of any sense of fun. This game is failure in every sense of the word. Avoid the pain and get something else.			"

												This game is interesting. The graphics aren't the best but at first I enjoyed it. But then I saw Americian Truck Simulator and thought this game isn't very good. Well this game is alright but it is kind of glitchy and arcade like. but I enjoyed myself for a little bit of time. You can customize your truck a bit but not nearly as much as Euro Truck Simulator 2. The storyline is decent but honestly there are better trucking games out there. If you want an americian trucking game either wait for Americian Truck Simulator or go check out the 18 Wheels of Steel games because I had enjoyed those ones. So I would rate this game a 6.8/10. Once again I am on the edge here but I will recommend it because I got a few hours of enjoyment out of it.			"

												ok where to start. I will agree with most of the reviews on here. first and foremost THIS IS NOT A SIMULATOR. this is a arcade truck driving game. In my opinion this game has decent graphics for American trucks, and at present (to my knowledge) is the newest american truck driving game out until American Truck SImulator. but as stated earlier two entirely seperate games. Some Pros: Freightliner endorsed, variety of cargo, scenery is decent to look at (looks just like the california intersate) Traffic controls (for those that like light or no traffic) and there is a story line.  CONS: bad physics, low grade interior graphics, cops are too touchy, and the game is incomplete (as in-game the radio talks about and advertise a Las-Vegas add on yet it never was made). Closing Remarks: Play the game with an open mind and i think you will like it. as some have mentioned about no waypoints in the beginning of the game, just drive for a bit and something will happen.

												I find this game really hard to recommend. I really wanted to like it, as the basis of the game is something that should be fun. After playing it for a few hours, it is the complete opposite. Graphical glitches, poor camera angles, and a few bugs that will cause the game to completely crash.If there was a patch to fix these errors, and introduce a better camera, this game would be much more playable. But in the current state, you can safely pass this one up.			"

												It's a very very good truck driving sim. Is it realistic it tries to be. but its very easy on the traffic and the controls are bit ponderous. Grfx are ok. Fun to play. BUy it if you always wanted to know what it was like to control one of these beasts.			"

												Don't purchase this game if you are looking for a truck sim. Just purchase American Truck Simulator instead. If you are looking for a casual arcade style trucking/racing game with a story then I'd recommend this. The things I like about this game is that there are real truck models used for example, Kenworth, Freighliner, Peterbilt, Western Star, etc... The damage mechanics are more detailed than in ATS, and the truck interiors are also detailed. The graphics however is a major negative, but then again this game was released in 2010.			"

Weather you're a Hard Trucker or just a casual looking to enter the exciting world of trucking, this game is for you.			"

												If you want a simulation game, prepare to be disappointed in this. As an arcade game, this game kicks ♥♥♥. Vanilla is OK, i recommend RnRMod 2.0 for the best gameplay. The fact that everything in this game is 1:1 scale and in real time makes this  game feel kinda, unique in a way. The customization is pretty good too, plenty of options to style your rig.  Driving is a bit wonky and the AI is glitchy but oh well, it's still a pretty good game. Oh and the awkward cutscenes. Worth 9.99e? I don't think so, get this game in a sale or a bundle			"
