												All my life I have been empty. The doctors could not tell me why I was so depressed, and I never knew myself until today. I needed to experience my life as a goat. Goat Simulator has filled the void in my life.I knew as soon as I hit the truck with my goat that this was what I had been missing. I flew through the air in slow motion, tongue flying around, hitting the edge of the map and rebounding back, landing on (and falling through) the roof of a house. I could not get out, but that did not matter. I was treated with the ability to look down into the house beneath me, seeing the unsuspecting people casually sitting at their computers, oblivious to the sheer terror of the goat above them.Whether it was playing football with a basketball, swinging lampposts into groups of people or even doing 1080 degree flips, there was no limit to life as a goat. I didn't think it could get any better than this.I was wrong.As I jumped and screamed my way around the map, leaving a path of destruction in my wake, I happened upon a golden statue. Curiosity overtook me and I resisted the urge to grab it no longer. My life as a goat changed completely. I had a jetpack.I knew that this was meant to be, and what my mission from the Great Coffee Stain in the sky was. I was granted the supergoat power of being able to lift people and cars with my tongue. I could survive any impact. I could slow down time with mere thought. Now I could fly. It was time for world domination. Humanity had to be silenced so that the new goat overlords could reign supreme.All the humans are dead or enslaved. I have won. I am the goat, the goat is me.Go and goat this game. I kid you not, for mere bucks you can experience a sandbox like no other. Destruction, mayhem, death defying stunts. Seriously, there are more than 921 million goats in the world. Killing the humans was just part of the game. This is a SIMULATOR. Do you understand? A SIMULATOR. This can happen. There are enough goats out there to enslave us and/or kill us. It is your duty as a human to get this game, so that you may truly know your enemy. An enemy people do not take seriously, an enemy that we know nothing about. Coffee Stain studios have granted us the insight into the true terrifying reality of the impending Goatpocalypse. This is your weapon against the goats. Be prepared, for the goats are coming to get us.			"

												So I was deciding whether to do a serious review on Goat Simulator because I haven't seen one on Steam; so rather than join the bandwagon of unfunny jokey reviews for the game, I'll stick to my guns...Goat Simulator does exactly what it says on the tin; you play as a Goat, You cause havoc wherever you go; trashing, bashing, causing explosions, destroying houses, jumping on trampolines, basically anything you want. With plenty of interactive objects in the game, you can spend plenty of time wandering around never finding a dull moment. The graphics in goat simulator are really nice. They aren't on the levels of Evolve or something, but for this type of game, you aren't really going to be playing for the top of the range graphics.  The music and audio are exactly what you would expect here; derpy music in the background as you potter about the city, along with cries of fear from the civilians as the demon goat runs rampant.There are three different areas in Goat Simulator; each zone is huge, ranging from theme parks, to crop fields, every building has something to do in it, every room has something to interact with or destroy. I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with either of the levels included here.  There is nothing difficult in the game to do here at all. There are no real objectives, just an open world sandbox game where you do whatever you want, whenever you want. I have managed to put about twenty hours into Goat Simulator; most of this time was playing on local screen co-op with my girlfriend, and then a couple more hours’ achievement hunting, and boy there is some pretty ridiculous achievements to do. Other than the developers openly coming out stating that they would not be fixing any bugs in the game, I had no real game breaking bugs, apart from sometimes falling through the world; however this was fixed easily by just respawning again. If you want a game that is just purely for messing around in with no real aim and wanting some real stupidity, then Goat Simulator will give you plenty of fun; granted this type of game is not for everyone, I enjoyed it though. Tom's Score Card1) Stay away2) Not Recommended3) Only recommended when on sale4) Recommended5) Highly recommended6) This is a must playIf you would like to follow my reviews more easily, be sure to join my group by clicking here.

Cows are just overweight goats that can't sit. Giraffes are just really tall goats, bears are buff and fluffy goats.""After playing this game i can only say how right that man was, and i will never look at the world the same i looked at it before.life-changing game, would recommend to my children.

												When I was six years old, we were asked what we wanted to be when we grew up. Sure there were lots of aspiring astronauts, lawyers, doctors, movie stars, and professional athletes. I wanted none of that. Since I grew up around farms, I had a deep admiration for goats. They were masters of their domains, and they didn't take nonsense from anyone. The goats were free to roam, climb, fornicate, and eat anything they could find. So it only made sense that I wanted to be a goat when I grew up.My teacher and fellow students told me my dream was unrealistic and impossible.The Steam Gods have gifted me with Goat Simulator 2014 GOATY Edition.Now who's laughing?

												Goat Simulator has a deep story line and boasts some of the best physics and graphics I've seen in any modern day game. The portrayal of each character is well thought-out and the achievements gained by playing the game are meaningful. Whether you are gracefully flying over a map after a large explosion, or helping a person cross the road, players of all ages are bound to enjoy this game. My grandmother watched me play the game, and now she has set up her own Steam account for the sole purpose of playing Goat Simulator. Even my dog Clifford is getting into it, and now has accumulated over 300 hours worth of solid gamplay. Coffee Stain Studios should be given a big pat on the back and a rousing round of applause. 11/10- Would lick again			"

												A great game for a few hours of laughs and crazy antics. Its more of a ""go around and mess stuff up"" kind of game, but I have no problem with it. I find it hilarious and a great time. There are several secrets and quests that keep the game going after the innitial ""I'm running around as a goat, this is hilarious"" wears off. Very entertaining, but unless the workshop support for this game takes off, it will have very little replayablility. Still, great for what it is and if you enjoy silly and rediculous humor, pick up goat simulator. Worth It In A Bundle  "

												I always knew there was something wrong with me. I licked people, I liked destroying fencing, and I enjoying ring-fighting goats. I never knew there were others like me. I stumbled apon this game and I needed it. I wanted it. I HAD to have it. Since I was poor, I had to have it gifted to me. Soon, it popped up in my gift inventory and I quickly started and dowloaded the game. I was transported to a land. A land of my people. I met other people like me. Or should I say goats like me. I soon had a family of goats. They were my best friends. Soon I decided it was the right time. I went to my doctor and decided to become a goat. After the surgery, I put my hooves on my keyboard and began playing. It felt wrong. I was making fun of my people. Soon, as a rebellion, I began acting out. At school, I would sprint down the hall and headbutt teachers and fellow students. They all laughed at me, they thought I was different. I logged back into Goat Sim and consoled with my people. Soon they advised me to continue. I skipped school the next day. I ran through my town, screaming and licking. The cops could not contain me. I ran to the petting zoo and let all of the goats free. We soon took over the world. Bow down to me, peasants, or join us, become a goat WITH US! MUAHAHAHAHAHA			"

NOTICE: This review is EXTREMELY old and contains EXTREMELY outdated information. Please take this into consideration before starting another ♥♥♥♥ing flame war in the comments. Let’s get this first bit out of the way up in front: putting Goat Simulator on a traditional 1-to-10 rating scale is pretty much impossible.Goat Simulator is something of a paradox. It's a haphazard conglomeration of shallow, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game mechanics that still somehow equals something much greater than the sum of its parts. Most bargain bin games last too long and don’t have any personality; Goat Simulator bleeds personality but wears itself out much too quickly.In short, it’s like slamming down 20 bucks for half of a chocolate bar, but it’s the best damn chocolate bar you’ll ever have the pleasure of consuming.The game prides itself on its broken ragdoll physics; headbutt a person and they’ll go flying off into the sunset with their limbs splayed all about, headbutt a gas station and you’ll go flying off into the sunset with your limbs splayed all about. The problem here is that ragdoll physics abuse has been present in video games for the last decade or so, ranging from dragging bodies around in Deus Ex Human Revolution to blowing enemies sky-high in Just Cause 2 to… well, Garry’s Mod, full stop. Everything you’re going to see in this game is something you’ve probably already seen before.Perhaps the game’s biggest flaw is its scoring mechanics. Or, to be more specific, that the scoring mechanics don’t really mesh with the rest of the game all that well. By performing certain actions, such as ramming things, licking things, and jumping over things, you can combo these actions together to increase your score as well as extend your combo and gain score multipliers. However, most of the actions you can perform that won’t result in your goat ragdolling uncontrollably will stop increasing your score multiplier VERY quickly, and if you DO end up ragdolling, chances are high that you won’t be able to recover in time to extend your combo further anyways.The most aggravating part of this discrepancy is that the actions that do result in you ragdolling uncontrollably – such as getting thrown into a trampoline by a rogue treadmill – are worth the most points out of any action in the game. This is only made worse once you realize that trying to earn a high score unlocks absolutely NOTHING. Compare to Saints Row IV’s insurance fraud missions, where you have to abuse your ragdoll enough within a set amount of time in exchange for monetary and experience rewards.Paradoxically, the game’s strongest point is its bizarre sense of humor, and I’m not referring to the cheap novelty of playing as a jelly-legged goat. The game’s too-small map is absolutely jam-packed with easter eggs and shout-outs. Destroying the gas station gets you the Michael Bay achievement. Bringing five people to a pentagram gives you the power to create gravity wells. Dragging a boulder in front of a normally indestructible car causes it to explode violently. Bringing a bacon-beacon to a crop circle causes a UFO to abduct you. There are rioters carrying signs that read “no♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped food”. Standing inside an outhouse for three seconds nets you over a thousand points. There’s an anime robot hiding in a shipping container suspended by a crane. Doing nothing for five minutes turns you into a low-gravity angel goat. Coffee Stain Studios’ in-game building features a playable Flappy Bird clone. The list goes on and on and on.Because of the large amount of easter eggs present within the game, the game is at its most entertaining when you’re NOT throwing yourself around like a maniacal rubber squirrel. Finding many of the upgrades for your goat requires exploring the game’s environment, which itself requires a surprising amount of dexterity. There’s a Baseball Cannon nearby where you start the game, which you can strap to your back and fire at will. There’s also the Jet Pack hidden inside the construction site, which is about as useful as you’d expect from a game like this (it’s completely useless). Perhaps the most noteworthy of these collectables are the 30 goat trophies hidden across the map; every 10 trophies you collect will unlock a whole new species of goat for you to use: a giraffe, an ostrich, and an alien from Sanctum 2. Quite a few of these trophies are legitimately challenging – and entertaining - to collect.Perhaps the game’s greatest saving grace is the Steam Workshop integration. Though ironically (or perhaps fittingly), even getting THAT to work properly can be problematic – you’ll need to install the 64-bit version of the game’s executable, which comes with the game’s mod development kit. And even then, many of the custom maps available will still cause the game to crash on startup.Once you’ve gotten the bloody thing to WORK properly, however, it’s worthwhile. Some of the community-created add-ons are an absolute blast to use. There are mods that let you chuck explosive watermelons as fast as you can mash the use key, there are mods that turn you into a goat-shaped Nyan Cat, and there are mods that let you play pinball with the goat as the ball. Since the game is still brand new, much of the game’s potential has gone untapped. However, given some time, the possibility that a truly amazing game could evolve from these add-ons is extremely realistic… provided that said add-ons don’t freakin' crash the game.Overall, the game itself honestly isn’t all that bad – it’s actually pretty entertaining, but for all the reasons that they DON’T mention on the game’s Steam Store page. The game’s biggest flaw isn’t that the game is broken, it’s that the game is… incomplete. There’s a lot of stuff to see here, especially with the game’s Workshop integration, but the game’s core mechanics simply don’t mesh with each other very well (if at all). The game doesn’t even seem to know what its core audience is supposed to be – small children, experienced DOOM-era gamers, and programmers would probably find the game hilarious, but your average Angry Birds player will look at this game and wonder how the world became so full of stupid people.If you’re the type of person who greatly enjoys making mods, enjoys breaking games in half, or simply needs a cheap laugh once in a while, then Goat Simulator may very well be one of the best games you’ll ever play. However, if you don’t fit into any of the above categories, then I regret to inform you that you’re probably better off spending your money on something else.It’s a shame, really – there’s a fantastic game buried in here somewhere, it’s just that nobody’s found it yet.

IntroHave you ever dreamed of being a goat? Exploring lands as a goat? Maybe smashing into cars and watching them blow up? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this game is for you! If you answered no to any of these questions, this game is for you!Goat Simulator is a game in which you take on the role of a goat. An invincible goat, that is. You start in a small town with a party, construction site, and a satanist sacrifice forest. You can simply roam the city and explore, you can cause mass chaos and blow up gas containers or parked cars, you could become a sky diving goat and jump off a construction crane, hitch a ride on a paraglider, or get hit by a bus just because you can!What you can do as a goat Fly with a jetpack uncontrollably Get hit by a bus Lick a bolder and throw it down at civilians having a barbeque Have a party and become DeadGoa7 Get beet up by people in an ally Ride a bike Use your oh so powerful tongue of yours to hold onto a ferris wheel Swim by simply jumping in water and willing yourself to move Become an angel goat Become a devil goat Become a anything-you-eat-will-turn-into-a-bomb goat Go on the workshop and become a <fill in workshop item here> goat. Do anything else you've ever desired to do as a goat Run head on into a building/car and just fall down Scale walls with your amazing goat sprint jump ninja skills Run into civilians and hear them scream because they fell over and watch them glide up and run away Walk into a carnival, jump into a booth, people scream, trying to run away, and then say ""Is that a goat??!""Score: Goat/10 would play againSystem SpecsCPU: AMD FX 8320 OC at 4.1GHzGPU: EVGA GTX 760 OCRAM: 8GB RAM			"

												Obviously, Goat Simulator was never meant to be anything more than an interactive joke in the world of games. And as a joke, it exceeds all expectations. However, as a game that is for sale it falls short of reasonable expectations. After all of 30 minutes, the novelty of ""I can run up to X and headbutt it"" passes. With that passing comes the realisation of just how shallow the game really is.			"

												Dear Steam User:The Game you are currently looking at is so magnificent that words are unable to describe it. I highly reccomend that you purchase this game or prepurchase it if you are looking at this review before it is released on steam.If someone was to tell you that this game was not good or it was bad/horrible and they have never seen this game before, here is what you should do:1. Show them the gameplay trailer2. If you have this game, let them play it for a bitIf neither of these 2 options work, you have these options1. ♥♥♥♥♥-Slap them across the room2. Kill their family and burn their home3. Burn their current console that they are using to play Call of Duty on.4. Sentence them to death via Woodchipper5. Sentence them to death via Goat6. Paint your room with their blood7. ShrekIn conclusion this is truly a magnificent masterpiece in gaming and i can say it has completed my life.'I regret nothing' - The Peacekeeper "

And if that wasn't enough, I discovered human technology, a jet-pack to be more precise, with it I could fly like a bird.

												You're a goat. Your goal? Become the queen of your town. Or the bay. Lick people! Use them! Get hit by cars! Meet aliens! Play Flappy Goat! Become Deadmau5's successor! Get nice heads! Have special powers! Choose to be an evil or an angel! Find trophies! Get achievements! Get cards.... The only thing missing is a MMO and zombies....Oh wait.MMO exists! You're a goat (or a micro-wave). Your goal? Doing all quests. Or put these freaking sheeps or rams in their places. Meet new people! Chat with them... well, if you can find how to do it. Or just read their hilarious discussions. Play with elves! Mermaids! Demons! Old Goat! Get inside a town and do your worse! Reach level 101! Kill dodos! No wait don't kill them! So zombies now...Oh wait.There is a DLC you must buy for that. Anyway, you've been warned. Goat Simulator is offering so many mutators, so many fun references and so many options that you get past the seriousness you may have when playing. The game is made for relaxing. Bugs? You can find some but not as much as you should expect.If I've played it, it means something. Because I rarely play that kind of game. I wasn't even sure if I would played it. Curiosity won. Never regretted my purchase.			"

In-game objectives are constantly making me discover new things, and boy the Easter eggs themselves are more than enough to keep my interest for way longer.The controls are actually pretty good haha, you can do a multitude of things like headbutt and find special items in-game to gain special abilities (become a tank shooting baseballs or summon peasant goats when you become king goat...) Overall this game is really a lot of fun, and not just because of the silliness haha~!			"

												Updated: I started this review looking into the game in stages rather than as a whole, as that is pretty much how I played it. So this is pretty much several mini reviews in one, all spaced apart from update to update.GoatVilleGaming just goat serious.If this game doesn’t get GOTY (Game of the year... goat of the year, ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)haha get it?)  then you just goat to be kidding me…I mean, if it doesn’t float your goat, then that’s fine. It might not be everyone’s cup of tea. But seriously, this goat is just too goat....(I’m sorry…) But in all seriousness, it’s the one of the most original and fun games that I have played in a while. It’s got a good humour to it. You can tell the people that made it were just having a laugh and it seems to me they didn’t expect it to get as big as it did. I think it was pretty refreshing when it came out, something different and stupid to mess around on. Has quirky little things in the game that makes you chuckle and I have never known ragdolls to fail at making people laugh.The fact that it has Steam workshop makes it a lot more appealing also, there is plenty to do but you have that extra option to keep you entertained if you ever wanted to re-visit. I really enjoyed it and look forward to any updates that may come to this game. There’s many more possibilities with maps and different goats, so who knows! All in all you just have to get this game and give it a fair goat.Goat City BayThey updated the game to have another map and twice the achievements. Essentially free DLC, which I thought was actually a really nice addition to the game. It gives you more play time and new features to mess around with. It also shows the developers are in this more so for the long run than a quick cash builder because it blew up. I would easily say the update doubled the game, I completed the updated achievements 100% again although there were a few trickier ones this time around. I really hope they keep them updates coming!Goat MMO SimulatorThis update was a pretty big one! They took a whole new turn with it as well. Goat MMO Simulator was a great idea. It was a nice way to keep the game’s silly yet quirky charm going. Something new and different and it really was fun. I would say that I found this update easier to 100% then Goat City Bay but that makes it no less enjoyable. There were a few references I was pleasantly surprised/amused by. This ‘free extra content’ thing Coffee Stain Studios have going on here is great. Again, I would love to see more in future!–--------------------------------------------------------------------------After the above point, they started releasing even more DLC and it became too much to fit into this one review for the base game, so I am just reviewing the DLC separate from now on their own store pages.I love this companies enthusiasm and the way that they are keeping up with the times by turning the gaming industries “latest fads” into new comedic expansions. They do a great job and although they started to charge for their DLCs, I think they deserve to be able to earn a bit more from the work they have put into this bizarre creation.  TL;DR : Goats, basically. You mess around as a goat, in a world that is one massive joke against the gaming industry, it’s genres and it’s latest fads. It’s fun, although random. Full of references and dumb stuff to find and do, although I have heard from a few people it’s hard to get into and can be easy to get bored of after a few minutes.For anyone interested, My Review for GoatZ:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/344450/ "

Whatever.See, the thing is, this is a joke that is only good for an hour. Hour and a half, tops. And so far, at prices nearing the $10 mark, this is a damn expensive joke. Especially considering that every last pewdiepie-wannabe on youtube will have a let's-play of this within the week. You gain almost nothing by playing this joke out for yourself - the gameplay as such is.. well, it's passable and nothing more; there's no intrinsic pleasure to be gained from being the one behind the keys. So.. you know, just go and read an article about this on whatever gaming site you like best. Maybe watch a youtube video. The net gain will be the same, but you'll still have your money.			"

												What to say about this game? Well, you play as a goat, and you run around and run into things, lick things with your toungue, and other things in each maps. Some of the dlc are actually quite fun, like the waste of space one.Quite one of the funniest games i have played personally. There are even glitches in the game on purpose that even make the game even more funny. Only get it if you want a game where you play a goat and can get glitched up.Also, there are morphs that allow you to change the base goat to different forms, and each form has their own powers and downfalls. This makes the game even more fun.Recommended for comedic value and just plain sillyness.			"

												The second I heard of this game, I just had to have it. Following Coffee Stain since Sanctum, I was excited to see what they could pull off branching out to something as whackey as this.Boy did they deliver, this game is easily GOATY: (G)ame (O)f (A)ll (T)he (Y)ears.It starts out as a simple, casual fun sort of game. Allowing you to get in to all sorts of trouble with your goatiness. The game is fully explorable from the start. - Despite the assumed instability of a game that's spazzy as good ♥♥♥♥, it's actually surprisingly stable, or at least has been for me (and I'm not on the greatest computer in the world).However, though simple at first, the game also offers ample challenge for those who're more adept to the gaming universe, certain achievements require you to bring your A-Game and nothing less; Goat Simulator I feel is a great title for both casual and experienced gamers, even more-so for gamers who merely want some good laughs. Just about everything I did in this game made me at the very 'least' smile, and was a great pick-me-up from the normal ""I'm so srs"" games. They really break out from the norm with their Tony Hawk's style 'secret gaps/events' so to speak. (Sorry guys it's the only thing I could think to relate it to lol) Headbutting a gas station, or shooting a basketball in to a goal-field are some examples; they really put some genuine thought in to what players could get in to, and that makes this game just so much more epic.Spoiler regarding unlockables:The unlockables in this game are great too!  Varying from alternate models of your goat, such as the Giraffe and Ostrich as some examples, which both give their own unqiue flavour of the gameplay. There's also a bunch of mutators for the game already, you just have to unlock them first.  Though with Workshop compatibility from the get-go, I foresee this game being full of player created maps, goats, and other fun content! Especially being of the Unreal engine, I'm very excited to see how this game grows.But as it stands, it's already a bundle of fun, and a must-have for those who want a ""realistic"" goat simulation experience.*TL;DR:Buy Goat Simulator, is good game.Baah.

												You are spending $10 for a 1-2 hour joke.""It's supposed to be buggy, it's supposed to be bad, it's funny how buggy it is!""Yes, I hear you, but it's still $10.  Thankfully I got it for $0.99 on sale, and found that to be semi-worth it, it was funny.  But in the end, it's a joke game.  Like a gag-gift.Buy at your own discression.			"

												once a true story, it is now a forgotten legend due to a legendary hero defeating the goat king.What's this?You don't know that legend?Of course you don't, buttfarts, it's forgotten!Now sit down on your fanny cakes, as I retell the legend of legends.    Once upon a time, in a time that once existed after time, there was a walrus queen who ruled all time. The walrus queen was not beautiful. At all. Her fanny was tied in a knot, her whiskers a flood on her face; Short story, she was ugly! However, the walrus queen did do her role in walrus society. And that was holding a bucket and pretending she was a whale. This one day, the walrus queen, as everyone knows, asexually reproduced, and out popped a little rascal: a goat. The walrus queen looked at the little baby goat, charmed by its exquisitely beautifulness. She then whips her tail at the goat, kicking the goat into the dark, blue sea, because that's what all walruses do to their babies. True story! So the walrus queen's a butt now, yada yada yada, but who cares about the walrus queen? I don't. Let's follow that goat, eh?  The goat's body lay motionless, floating on the surface of the sparkling ocean. But if you remember correctly, if you remember the last paragraph, this goat WAS the birth baby of the walrus queen. As if magic was real, this little goat started jumping ON the water, over the water at high speed! Yet, he hardly moved, but little ragdoll-like movements! What could this goat be capable of?! The goat sped over the high seas, across storms, across boats, but none had hurt his lightning speed! Well, maybe the boat. It did have a hot tub after all... I mean, this goat was going REALLY fast! But alas, all crazy things may come to an end. Or will they? After a day and a day and a d- a very long time, the goat landed on land. An island with a small city, and a theme park! What trouble could the little fartbrain get into here?     After a few hours of sunbathing on the warm sand, the little goat stood up, with little to no effort! Like magic! But not. The little goat gazed around, seeing the umbrellas and towels and... people! Suddenly, the kid had a sudden want of suddenly... licking everything? Within a second, the goat's really long tongue shot out and struck the closest person; a very fat man. The tongue was sticking to the plump man! The goat started to run away, but somehow, the tongue had like 50 bajillion muscles, as the fatty was being dragged by the tongue! That's gross. That's really gross. It's just like that Steamer guy from Right 2 Alive. BUT let's not talk about that. Let's talk about the horror that the goat will become.    No one screamed or anything. They just kinda stared at the animal pulling a somewhat lifeless man with its tongue. I guess there WERE some crazy people who said, ""Aww, that's so cute!"" At least that was the last thing they said, as they were dragged to nowhere at somewhere. The little goat had so much stamina. Or was stamina even a word for him? He would never stop! Well, he did stop in front of a store. Full of hats. BEAUTIFUL hats. Detaching its tongue from a pink lady, the goat stared through the windowed display. He took one step back. The goat then RAMMED THROUGH THE WINDOW, BLEATING AROUND. He then licked all of the hats. All of them.But... what's this? They're... GOAT-PROOF?! The kid stared at the hats, with a sad look. The shopkeeper. who was somehow unafraid, stood behind the counter. ""Ya need money, kid."" The goat stared at the shopkeeper.   The city's probably bankrupt now. I mean, no one has money now, except the shopkeeper. And the only thing now that the goat owns is a pile of hats. HATS. I wonder if he would give me so- I mean, he had a lot of hats. So off around, again he pranced. He did all kinds of things a goat wouldn't do. But would. So events and events and event after event*, he finally came about to a majestic land, full of majesticness! THE THEME PARK! There was SO MUCH to do! And that he did*.  The goat spent years, years growing up at his simple life, without drink, food, or anything. But when he explored further, he found another city. With his tongue and head bashing, PROFESSIONAL skills, he explored once more. He became the demon king, the summoner of whales, and became the first goat with a jetpack. He trampled with boulders, destroyed many landmarks, and defeated the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped food protestors. He was a hero(?). But there he stood, before a tall tower, there were some. Some of his own kind. What nonsense was this? He licked and rammed the goats off the tower, because this goat is a total di-, ah-, jerk. There was a small entrance at the top of the tower's spiraling stairs. Curiousity never killed the goat, so why say not to the goat entering it?   The goat entered a large, sparkling hall, with goats side by side along the long red carpet. The goat peered at the large throne ahead of him. There was no one there? He began to ram every single goat. With all the peasant goats laying on the shiny clean floor tiles, the goat then claimed the throne as his own. Everything began shaking, as if Zeus himself farted on the world in disgrace. The goat fell unconscious, with the world spinning around him.  The goat awoke in a grass field. He felt a weird tightness around his forehead. He had a crown. A KING'S crown. He had known what had happen. He had to go to the urinal, but couldn't hold the pain anymore, so he fell unconscious. Right? OH, wait wrong game. But, I think he's the Goat King now! The Goat King bleated proudly, loudly. Then peasant goats, PEASANTS, began to rain like, well, falling goats from the sky! The Goat King was unafraid. These were his peasants. And by this, he would make an army.    So World War lll almost started, so what? The Goat King continued with doing everything he did in his own childhood, except with x10 more goat. The people were frighthened, some crazies still saying, ""Aww, that's cute."" Again, before getting rammed. So chaos pursues! But chaos always has an ending! It wasn't like there was police or anything, just... Listen! As the Goat King was terrorizing children while riding a bicycle, a loud booming voice was heard. ""STOP!"" The Goat King lost controlk of the bicycle and rammed into a gas truck. That truck exploded shortly after. Regaining strength, the Goat King turned his head to see a majestic, plump figure. It was HIM. It was Gaben.   The Goat King was aware of this legendary hero. But he wasn't aware that The Gaben would come after himself. ""STOP!"" The Gaben repeated. The Goat King, however, did not want to stop. The Goat King bleated as loud as he could ever bleat, summoning more peasants from the sky. The bodies hit the floor. They did nothing. The peasant goats never did anything. They're useless. The Gaben shook his head in disbelief. The Goat King was pi- angry now! With the gracefulness of a bull, he began to charge towards the Gaben. The Gaben was in no harm. In fact, he was never in harm at all. Calm and majestically, he rose a finger towards the charging Goat King. As the Goat King's nose and the finger of the Gaben came in contact, The Gaben said his own name. ""Gaben."" (Of course, a legendary hero would never reveal their own name.) The Goat King was frozen. With a flick of his wrist, the Gaben blasted the Goat King into sky, the Goat King leaving a trail of dosh, money, and all of that shizzles. The Gaben smiled at the defeated villain. He then flew away on his flying tub of butter.Legend says the Goat King still bleats in space. Truth says Gaben's still a hero.  This ""simulator"" isn't a ""simulator."" This is time, the time of the Goat King, BEFORE he was defeated by The Gaben.This is a story. The story of the Goat King. And you're the writer. "

												I'm sorry, but i don't see the humor in this game. It's fun for like, 5 minutes, and then its just boring. If it gets any better, I might change my mind. Sure, there are mods, but that just doesn't save it. This wouldn't be that bad if it was at like 5 dollars, but I recommend buying Terraria or Garry's Mod with the 10 dollars.			"

												I don't like it. The gag is as follows. ""Hey! Look at this silly goat! It's doing things that goats don't normally do! lolololololol ragdol fisikz""As you could probably guess, the gag wears thin quickly. There are some good laughs in the achievement ""Micheal Bay"", which you get from exploding a gas station, but they're one-time jokes. The few maps are pretty small, condensed, but don't have enough content to be fun for more than 20 minutes each. ""But you can download more!"", I hear you cry, but alas- mods suck. The modding community is smaller than a pinecone that has been grown to a couple pages worth of pinecone-leave-things that crash the game when they're loaded.* The other ""goats"" you can download and unlock are, again, good for a few laughs. I've never seen another game where Shrek can fly around on all fours with a jetpack before lightly touching a vent and being flung into the stratosphere. The problem is that said experience is just not fun, and it takes control from your hands for a while until you hit the ground again.The scoring system makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever, it seems to just throw points at you willy-nilly for being airborne and doing some spins or something, but it feels like however many points I got had nothing to do with me, making most of the achievements feel meaningless, as most of them come up to ""Score points"" or ""Stay airborne for x seconds"".I know the game was made in a short time, I know it's meant to be bad, but that doesn't excuse it. Calling a rock a rock doesn't make it better than a rock.* Also, the game doesn't run very well on most computers, and that's weird. tl:dr Buy Garry's Mod. Same price, runs better on most computers, the gags in this game can be met and expanded upon with GM, better graphics, more interesting to play, and it also has ragdolls. There's probably a reason why almost every positive review of this game only talks about the fact that goats are in the game, so 10/10.*Aren't I great at analogies?			"

												Game name: Goat SimulatorReviewed by: WolfIn Summary...Goat Simulator is a widely popular indie game started by Coffee Stain Studios back in 2014. The overall game idea and atmosphere seems like a joke, literally, as it's littered with not only player mesh bugs but also gameplay and graphical bugs. Goat Simulator focuses around the idea of yes: being a goat. You're encouraged to cause chaos between multiple levels introduced from new updates and DLC. There is not much more to it than that, and as you can imagine, the novelty wears thin after a few hours time. Controls:WASD - Standard movementMouse - Standard lookQ - Ragdoll effectF - Slow MoE - ""Lick""Mouse 1 - HeadbuttMouse 2 - Rotate in air1 - BaaaSounds:The game features very basic sounds, it comes with an actual soundtrack which is played throughout. It's quite fitting, entertaining, and not very annoying as some games of the same genre are. They even have a Deadmau5 track as an easter egg! (Song is called Deadgoa7)Graphics:Here's where it gets tricky. The graphics are easily very good, as well as provide some high quality personality to characters and environments. Yet, since the first DLC, GoatZ, framerates have significantly dropped. I was able to run the vanilla game maxed out at 1080p 60fps (VSync on due to screen tearing, and I like it on in single player games), and when the DLC was released my framerates dropped to below 20's (at times) and that's with resolution downscaled to 720p and all settings on low. The Payday update did phenominally better, I was able to return to 1080p 60fps. I'm hoping the game developers realize they need to test a patch before sending it out. Game Balance:As stated before, the game is littered with bugs. Some, although comical (player model going crazy when going up ladders) which are quite comical and non-game breaking, and some which are completely trash (recently the Payday DLC, where you're allowed to drive vehicles. The vehicles have no control whatsoever, meaning the slighest bit of air causes you to flip over at times). You're able to get stuck into almost solid object by walking into it, sometimes even glitching through it and ending up in a non-escapable invisible area. There's some missing textures, some of which are walls you can just walk right on through. (Devs, there's a line between a comical glitch and a problem, for the love of god, glitches are problems.)OtherNone. Final Rating:6/10In Conclusion:When on sale (even not, third party sites offer this game dirt cheap) it's quite a great title, you can have plenty of fun mucking about being a goat and baaing some chaos onto the streets. The novelty wears thin after a while, so if you're not into taking a trip of doing some repetitive tasks (some do not realize theres actual objectives to the game) then this game isn't for you. Out of the time played and the DLC's released, it offered more than plenty of enjoyable time. (Also please fix the cars). Please feel free to follow my curation page for more recommendations. Thanks for reading!			"

												Let me get this straight, you want me to tell you a review about this game? Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.			"

YouTube™ Video: Analog Reviews: Goat Simulator 

			Views: 772		

			Is this little slice of gaming humor sublime or just plain BAHHHHHD. Trent trots his way around the world of Goat Simulator, kicking, licking and headbutting in order to find out!		

With it's sticky tongue wedge firmly in cheek, Goat Simulator has trotted onto Steam, kicking and headbutting it's way into cult game status with it's absurd four legged hijinx. Over the past few years the simulation game market has taken a page from Reality TV and has attempted to adapt every  imaginable banal blue collar occupation into a video game. The men and women who lead quiet lives of desperation as lumberjacks, farmers, truck driver, warehouse logistics managers and car mechanics have all been memorialized with insipid games that are mostly purchased by the same people who wear socks with sandals, have closets full of sweater vests and fastidiously maintain button collections. A few games have masked themselves as simulators but have delivered hilarious facsimiles of what they aim to simulate and perhaps the most absurd of these is Goat Simulator.  Capra aegagrus hircus, the domestic goat; hero of goat simulator. This four legged beast yearns to escape from his suburban backyard confinement, to be free to lick and kick and headbutt to his heart's content. Utilizing this creature's amazing dexterity, unparalleled agility and immense headbutting strength you must roam and conquer the lands held by homo sapiens... Or something like that. Goat Simulator doesn't attempt to have a plot, instead it places players in the middle of a suburban sandbox allowing them to roam around and use their bearded four legged monstrosity to complete a list of objectives and rack up points. Imagine playing Tony Hawk's Pro Skater without a time limit and instead of riding a skateboard, you filled the trotters of a barn yard creature... It's completely absurd and for the first hour or so a complete riot. The ragdolls and animations are intentionally ridiculous and the things your goat is able to do seem to have been the result of the the development team brainstorming while high and watching a Jackass marathon. Wearing a jetpack, sacrificing humans to satan, bouncing on trampolines, getting abducted by aliens and headbutting protestors are all normal Goat simulator activities. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously in the least. It's designed for pure hedonism and escapism.  That said, Goat Simulator is not without surprises however. Few other modern games encourage exploration and experimentation in the same way that Goat Simulator does. The list of objectives can be tackled in any order and bumbling around the map uncovers secrets and Easter eggs. There are a few special items lying around that can prove useful and these are not highlighted in any way giving players a welcome surprise when they are able to pick them up and use them. Pretty much any and every object of interest that you can see can be reached in some way. A jetpack can allow you to clumsily propel your bearded barn yard dwelling beast through the air while a pitching machine can allow your goat to fling baseballs at people and, if you are creative, glide. There are two reasonably large areas to explore  containing more than the asking price's worth of things to see and ruin.  When it comes to ruin, there are a few flaws that present themselves and diminish players desire to live out their wildest fantasies as a goat. The controls, and in particular the camera, are a bit sloppy making some moments where more precise movement is required a bit taxing. The camera has a tendency to clip through some walls making navigating tight spaces a chore. Controlling the bike is initially frustrating since it uses the mouse to steer and this simultaneously operates the camera. More vexing is the way multiple special abilities and mutators stack. By completing special actions your goat earns special abilities and these abilities are almost always mapped to the same key. There is no way to toggle between what special ability is active so each time you attempt to use a special ability several things happen simultaneously. For instance, there is a mutator that allows you to summon sperm whales from the sky and if you also have the mutator that allows you to drop Minecraft style blocks you will find that each time you toggle what type of block you wish to deploy moby♥♥♥♥♥♥drops from the sky like some sort of  divine curse cluttering the area. What's worse, creatures that are summoned do not despawn and after a while this will take a toll on your frame rate.  The developer of Goat Simulator has consciously neglected to fix any bugs that don't affect the stability of the game simply for amusement purposes. The problem is that physics bugs are the to video games what fart jokes are to cinema—decidedly low brow and with each cheap laugh the return is greatly diminished. Within the first hour, most players will exhaust the game of all it's humor leaving only the appeal of discovering what lies in the game world's nooks and crannies. Physics bugs are not the only imperfections that linger in goat simulator, some surfaces can be clipped through and may leave players trapped. Fortunately, a respawn option keeps any progress from being lost. A single horrible looping track makes up most of the soundtrack in Goat Simulator and makes playing for more than an hour or two nearly impossible. There are some additional tracks in specific areas of the game world but they don't offer much of a reprieve from the obnoxious primary track. Needless to say many players will have a love hate relationship with the games very deliberate lack of polish.  Being an urbanite, I must confess to knowing nothing about goats going into goat Simulator and after putting a half dozen hours into it I still know nothing about goats. That's just as well since the low brow laughs and stupidity provided by Goat Simulator are far more welcome than what sweater vest wearing button collectors might demand from such a title. The decision to keep this simulator rough around the edges works against it as much as for it but at the end of the day this clunky little title provides sufficient amusement to justify its asking price.

												A relaxing and hilarious simulation game with silly animations, dialogues, achievements alongside realistic MMO Mode.My Rating: 7/10First dialogue I hear in the game: Is that a goat?No it's a bird! It's a plane! IT'S ＧＯＡＴ ＣＥＮＡ!!!!!I really like the open-world concept in this game that you can do pretty much everything as a goat. It really gives the casual Grand Theft Goat Auto feels with no missions and storyline attached unless you're chasing for those achievements which require a bit of an effort. The ragdolls, wallclimbing and other various animations are very funny to see, although climbing ladders with your head is a bit weird. Some of the achievements, side-quests and dialogues are trolls and very meme-like. Yes, there's even achievements for crashing your game and getting stucked in a demonic chamber. The mechanics and materials of this game are very idealistic and fun to enjoy at. I beat Michael bay Turtles and now I'm happy with my life. Well... at least that's what most of us wants.I can't say this game has the best graphics I've ever played though, I ran this game at a lower resolution due to my weak graphic card and I'm unable to fully judge the graphic smoothness and quality. Based on my opinion though, I honestly think that it's good enough to prevent people from complaining. Of course, with big plays come big bugs, some model glitches still happened and thank god the devs added the respawn button for it. Overall, I'll give this game a good-to-go ratings for the graphics.Let's move up to my favourite part! The MMO mode! I mean who doesn't love MMO?!Let me tell you a stupid story, I thought it was real people chatting in the MMO mode during my first play. I even tried to talk to them kek. The MMO chats are very realistic with people saying random stuff and even sending random guild invites to you! What's even more amusing? After I lurked around the game's forum a bit the devs actually used the discussions in the forum for the fake chats! There's even some lagging players and spinning around like a beyblade or something. The mimics such as the ""connecting"" screen did a very good job on simulating the real MMO loading screen. The quests are interesting to do, there's a lot funny stuff happened in the Goat realm, and I really have to say that I love the old school British name used in the MMO! :)Therefore, I'm proudly giving this game a solid good rating for the simulation, concepts and ideas.My recommendation: Buy this during an offer and play for stress-relieving, or just buy at full price if it doesn't worth the wait lol. It's worth a shot for casual players :)for people with overflowing money "

												At this point I have 180 hours to this “game”, & I use that word lightly. It is unlike anything else I have ever played before.Goat Simulator originally was a hoax, a trailer from Swedish based Coffee Stain Studios poking fun at the seemingly endless barrage of mind numbingly boring simulators flooding the market, but as the collective response of the mentally challenged individuals on the web screamed YOU HAVE TO MAKE THIS GAME, there was only one obvious rout to go, and thus Goat Simulator was born.With a very short development time Coffee Stain Studios have admitted there are bugs [and will only fix game breaking ones], but ask you embrace them as they make the game more entertaining. I mean how was a Goat supposed to climb a ladder anyways?The objective, if you can call it that is to mooch about doing everyday goat activities, like destroying Goat hendg, interrupting protests about pennies shaped foods, destroying Coffee Stain Studios office, sacrificing unsuspecting individuals to become a satanic goat, welding almost any object with your tongue, bouncing on trampolines, riding bicycles, eating mushrooms, being abducted by aliens, buying hats, licking anything and everything, parkour, taking over deadmau5 rooftop party, strapping fireworks to your back, pushing boulders into garden barbeques, Ow, if you were expecting things to make sense then you’re an idiot.Now with the addition of 4 DLC’s, MMO, Goatz, Payday & Waste of Space you can expand the bazaar & ultimately pointless shenanigans of the everyday life of a Goat and its friends it numerous ways. Adding story arcs, new maps, vehicles, quests and more, if you were one of the weird people that enjoyed the base game then this is more of the same on a stupider and grander scale.WARNING: This game may leave your with a fetish for Goats, I know it has for me.   10/10			"

												This game. Where to start. Goat simulator had taken over my life. I have spent countless hours on it and yet finding new things to do. new tasks to do and by far the most addictive game i've ever played!Pro's:- Very fun.- easily spend 15 mins waiting for another game.- can spend hours on end enjoying the fun.- really cheap.Con's:- once addicted... it takes over your life.For anyone still unsure about buying the game, here is my best anecdote. Strolling home late at night; i sit and wind down to goat simulator. 5 hours later im there running round as a penguin that is super buff one shotting cars all over the place. I then thought. I WILL OWN A GOAT..... Now I currently own 4 Pigmy goats and love them soo much!All in all... This game has made my life soo much more happier!!!!			"

												Goat Simulator is incredible. It's awful, and it's insulting, but it's everso slightly incredible at the same time. The game's own developer derides it, claiming the $10 it costs could be better spent on a bunch of bricks, and suggesting it'll be worth picking up in a two dollar sale.There is an interesting question to be had with Goat Simulator - when does pointing out one's own flaws cross the line from charmingly self-deprecating to conceitedly galling? Satirizing bad game design is something that games regularly fail at, because they fall into the trap of simply being the thing they're mocking. Roleplaying games that make fun of obligatory ""killing rats in the basement"" quests are simply hypocritical if they point out this cliche by making you go through with such a quest. Coffee Stain Studios is clearly having fun with the idea of knowingly selling a bad product. It proudly lists bugs as a feature, promising only to fix glitches that outright crash the game, leaving in everything else for hilarity's sake. With its bizarre physics and distinct lack of structure, one could make the case that Goat Simulator has a point to prove, providing a savvy commentary on the state of videogame design - not to mention the temptation of the modern game developer to make bizarre, ""random"" experiences simply to appeal to YouTube's Let's Play creators. The basics of Goat Simulator are as simple as simple gets - you are a goat, and you smash stuff up. Clicking the mouse as you run about causes the goat to smash things in his path, and pretty much everything exists to be smashed. From fences, to greenhouses, to cars and people, you're required to bash, explode, or otherwise ruin whatever you can get within bleating distance of. Essentially, that's the whole point, and there's very little to worry about beyond that.As you may have guessed by now, the game is a complete mess, and that's supposed to be part of the charm. The physics are insane, our titular goat liable to turn into a ragdoll at the slightest provocation, while random bric-a-brac bounces weightlessly around the environment with a mere touch. For a short while, Goat Simulator is pretty damn entertaining. It nails what made the ""Insurance Fraud"" minigames of Saints Row so much fun, and expands on the idea in a few amusing ways. With its fairly small map, and limited range of interactions, however, all the goat-based mayhem quickly becomes another Nobi Nobi Boy or Cargo situation - it's a delightfully eccentric experience that suffers from having way more fun with itself than the player can have.Ultimately, this game is a joke, and it's a joke with a limited shelf life. The humor soon wears off once you've made all the humans run screaming and sent your trotting little beast flying into the air with the help of a few industrial fans. While there are some great little secrets to discover, you only ever need to see them once, and there's very little to keep returning to the game for.As well as the vanilla experience, you can mutate your goat with various unique traits, all of which offer a chuckle the first time around. You can give your goat a ""Yoshi"" mutation, which lets him swallow items to make bombs, or give him the physical form of a giraffe just because it looks rather funny. These extra modes can extend the running joke a little while, but not for very long.As a joke, as a piece of interactive comedy, Goat Simulator is an undoubted success. The sheer concept is damn funny, and as you see everything for the first time, it's hard not to let a big grin spread across your face. Like all good gags, however, there's only so far it can be taken before it stops raising a smile, and by its very nature, Goat Simulator doesn't have the legs to last more than a short while.			"

That said; on sale for $5, it will give you more laughs than a lot of movies and if your library is lacking it's a good filler as you never know the next time you want to be a poorly scripted goat.

												**Before the review starts I want to say that my hours on the game are not me playing it, I played the game for about 3 hours and the rest are my little brother (8 years old) which liked this game so I let him play it.** So I bought Goat Simulator because of all the hype around it when it first came out and after playing it with it's 2 very tiny maps, I was dissapointed with it and just left it. A few months go by and the ""MMO Update"" came out, and I played it for an  hour until I had enough and left it alone because it was not fun. This game started a trend where people made bad simulator for the ""lols"" of it, which is dumb because it really is just a joke. Goat simulator tried to parody all the bad simulators that were out there before it but it just added itself to the pile of them. After this game a bunch of games got realeased: ""Rock Sim"" and ""Grass Sim"" and the list goes on and on which are all crap and are built around being crap like Goat Sim.The whole point of Goat Simulator is that it's glitchy and it's suppose to be bad but that in my opinion is just a dumb concept to build a game around. If lets say an item gets shot into outher space in a shooter or a similar game, it's halarious because that doesn't usually happen but in Goat Sim it's more like:I'm gonna walk this way, oh my goat glitched into the floor lol ok (respawns)Oh my goat  glitched and flew of to space.... I guess that's funny but now I have to walk all the way over there again.Ok I have to deliver this item to someone better grab it with my to- o it glitched, yet again..... x how much time you spend on this gamePros:+Funny for the first 30 mins+Collectibles to find across the maps+Funny references to other things+ Slow motion button  which is lovely Half Pros Half Cons:-/+Lots of easter eggs (too many and they get quiet repetitive)Cons:-The game is too glitchy to actually play-Tiny maps and a boring MMO map in the sense that it isn't creative in any way shape or form-Jokes that are childish-Jokes that are suppose to be funny but don't actually make sense (Played as a microave for example)-The score system can be beaten super easily so there is no point for it-If you try to knock over people they just get back up so there is no point of doing that-The ""AI"" is poop- Extremely annoying soundtrack that just loops around 3 songs-Jetpack is pointless because it just spirals out of control-30 fps cap-Ridiculous pop-inOverall 4/10 Don't buy this game just for the LOLS because you are just supporting a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

You're left with a bad game."" - Nerd³ (I know it's cheesy but it's true)You can watch his review of this game which inspired my review:

												It's stupid. It's fun. It's stupid fun. It's funny to watch the Let's Plays of this, but frankly it's twice as hilarious when you are the one making all kinds of dumb stuff happen. The maps are beautiful and there's an overwhelming amount of things to find, particularly in the bay map. The unlockables are also cool, and each time you play with a different kind of goat, you basically experience the game all over again in a slightly different way. You've gotta at least try this game.			"

												This isn't going to be a very popular opinion, but I really didn't like this game. I wanted to, and I tried hard to, I really, really did. It looked fun in videos, it came highly recommended by friends and it was on sale at the time I bought it. I should have had a blast with it. But this just doesn't do anything for me.A brief history for those not in the know, courtesy of Wikipedia, arguably the best pedia on the internet. Goat Simulator started off life as a prototype born from a game jam with the aim being to help developers better learn how to use Unreal Engine. Never intended for human consumption, a posted video went viral and demand pushed the creators to release the game proper, followed several months after by two sizable, free updates adding whole new areas, objectives and gameplay mechanics. It's a great little indie success story that shows how a good idea can be enough to capture people's imagination and wallets. Plus goats. Goats helped a lot there, too. So where did it all go wrong for me? Ultimately, I just didn't have any fun with it at any point.Play as a goat and cause general havoc to several areas and their denizens with a combination of wild goat moves, poor morals and bad physics. There are objectives in each area, but they really only serve as loose signposts to gently nudge the player to experiment with the different elements of the game. It's largely a destructive sandbox where you make your own fun and craft your own little adventure through the chaos. But the joke is that just about everything is intentionally bad. The AI has all the intelligence of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ potato, the physics seems to have something of a mind of its own and nothing really makes any sense, it just exists... because. All of that is absolutely fine and I can't fault the goal they were aiming for. But it just never feels like it works for me.As strange as it sounds, the joke doesn't feel ""earned"" here. Playing a game where the punch line is ""look at how broken this is"", but seeing it in something that's broken by design, just isn't very satisfying. Like... when you're watching dragons fly backwards in Skyrim or faceless teeth and eyes having a serious, heartfelt conversation with you in Assassin's Creed, that's proper p*ss yourself funny exactly because it's not supposed to be there. But when a game is filled with these kinds of things on purpose it loses what made it funny in the first place. I heard a great quote once, which I'm about to totally butcher, that to make people laugh is easy, you just put on an old lady wig and an old lady dress and some old lady glasses and you fall over, that's enough. But to make a comedian laugh it has to be a real old lady falling. And that's what this game feels like to me, it's someone in a silly wig and glasses falling over.In fairness, the free MMO update content is much better at hitting its target as it parodies all the tired old tropes of RPGs. Having a fetch quest where the items are literally surrounding the quest-giver, or an escort mission with the slowest NPC ever committed to code, or a chat box perfectly recreating the kind of inane drivel sometimes seen from a minority of bad players that makes you damn near suicidal... all of these things really have something to say and make their point beautifully. But for me it just felt like too little too late.For all the people who do love this game, I can't tell them they're wrong. If you enjoy something then it needs no further explanation or justification, that you had fun with it is all that matters, and I wish I could be in that group. But, sadly, if anyone asked then I couldn't recommend this. Go play Just Cause or Saint's Row for your sandbox mayhem shenanigans. Or better yet, go outside and punch a real goat. Aside from the social contempt and court fines, it's absolutely free!			"

												Have you ever wondered: what's it like for a day in the life of a goat? The majestic creatures, so far removed from our petty society that you can't help but long to be a part of them, have up until now been woefully misrepresented in video games. But no more! Goat Simulator has arrived and now you too can see what it is like to be one with the goat!If you are among those with a broken sarcasm detector, I will come out and say that this is not in fact the realistic goat simulating product we have all been waiting for. What it is however is one of the goofiest, completely absurd, and painfully entertaining games I've had the joy of playing in a very long time.Putting you in the hooves of an everyday goat, you are placed in what can best be described as an explosive physics sandbox. With the exception of a few challenges and some clever achievements, your only real task is to cause as much mayhem as you can in the most outrageous ways you can imagine. Licking a bolder and going on a rampage dragging it through the town? Strapping on a jetpack and dive-bombing the lowly humans? Wrecking studio of the developer that brought the game into existence? Pretty much anything you can imagine doing to terrorize and destroy the world is possible, and even if it's not built into the game Steam Workshop support makes it easy to add, giving you numerous methods to invoke chaos.Possibly more enjoyable than simply running around as a lunatic goat, is discovering all the hilarious Easter eggs that have been packed into the world. I won't spoil any of them here, but the amount of stuff that has been packed into what is actually a fairly small map, is rather impressive and had me laughing more than any other game of recent memory. Of the things Goat Simulator gets wrong, the spotty optimization is likely the most troubling. Despite what the modest system requirements would have you believe, there is a very good chance you'll have a hard time keeping a decent frame rate even on lowered settings. Hopefully this will be patched up, but as it stands expect middling to poor performance if you haven't just recently upgraded your PC.Inevitably, there are going to be some people that look at Goat Simulator and write it off as just another dumb joke of a game. And to be honest, that's not entirely unfair. This is among the stupidest games ever released, and it makes no qualms about being as ridiculous as it possibly could be. But that's exactly what Goat Simulator is supposed to be, and the reason it's become so popular. In the wake of so many dark and serious games, something so silly and gleefully entertaining is refreshing, and has helped remind me of the biggest reason I play games in the first place: to have fun!Review UpdateNot content to sit comfortably on their mountain of money, Coffee Stain Studios has since put out a giant patch that effectively doubles the size of the game (if not more). A new map to explore, wall running and grapple hook mechanics, and an absolutely absurd multiplayer mode (local only unfortunately) have expanded Goat Simulator into a bigger and more enjoyable mammal wrecking ball, humanity terrorizing sandbox. It's a great addition to an already entertaining game, and hopefully is only the first of numerous additions to come.			"

												Well, what can i say? This game is surprisingly fun. The world is interesting, you have funny stuff to do every few meters. The physics are done pretty well (meaning that they exaggerate so much, you constantly laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off). The controls work fine. You can even do things like backflips and get points for it. They put a big portion of Tony Hawk in the mix, so you really get points for everything you do - including a multiplier. This increases the fun a lot, and keeps you going. There are also collectibles in really strange places, and you have to find ways to get there. This can be quite tricky, but is also a lot of fun and some more motivation to keep playing.What do I not like in the game? The world is way too small. I don't see me playing this for like 20 hours. It is fun now, and I will do some more rounds, but in the long run it will get boring, I think. What is the whole world in this game now, should be one level from like 5-10.			"

												I bought Goat Sim on a whim, and it delivers exactly what it promises. A goat going around breaking things with pretty funny physics.However, it IS a novelty game that pretty quickly outlives it's fun factor and is something to be played in short sessions (like 30 minutes) as there is only so much fun that can be gained from a goat (or some eldritch abomination involving a microwave on long thin legs) with a bizarre tongue destroying everything in sight.The DLC game-modes and Achievement hunting add a bit to it, but it's still a short-lived novelty.I wouldn't recommend this game, but I would say it's good for a cheap laugh every so often. Play it with a friend with you so you can give each other dumb challenges (e.g. How far can you punt a goat with a truck?) and a Goat Simulator session will last longer.			"

About Goat SimulatorGoat Simulator is an open world sandbox in the truest since of the word. There are no objectives, no story and not even the possibility of death. Just you and three large maps to explore and cause havoc in. As the name implies you play as a goat that escaped from it's pen. He is far from a normal goat though as he can run on walls, has an incredibly stick tongue and is incapable of death despite being near explosions or falling down absurd heights.GraphicAre pretty nice as the game is running on the Unreal 3 Engine. Music is very silly and off beat which I imagine would be either love it or hate it type of soundtrack. Physics are over the top and very fun to watch fly around though you may occasionally get your head stuck in objects and watching a goat climb a ladder is equally terrifying and hilarious. It features full controller support and up to four player local coop which is always a blast. Steam Workshop is also integrated into this title allowing you to download new maps, powers and even game-modes such as pinball. There is no blood, gore or even strong language. The most adult joke in this game that I have seen is the no phallic shaped food sign I mentioned earlier. It may be a pretty good title to play with your children since there is 4 player coop and no death only fun. All in All Goat Simulator is a really Funny Game :-)9/10 Frome MeSweep "

												Well, where to start witht his game. It is pretty much impossible to actually ""rate"" this game, but I do have a strong opinion on it. This game is very much a one-trick pony, hahah you deadbutted something, oh look you headbutted something else, OH WOW, you headbutted ANOTHER thing. It simply is meant for people who are easily amused, and I'm not trying to say I don't like humor oriented games, but this is just rediculous. This is taken directly from the games description ""MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it In-game physics that spazz out all the time""...SERIOUSLY? It is just horrible to think that the game industry has resorted to dumb-minded humor and not even bothering to fix the game because ""LOLOL PEWDIEPIE AND NOVA ARE GONNA MAKE IT LOOK SOOOOOOOO FUNNY"".If this is the way more games are going to be, I better find a new hobby.

Don't get it.You explore a bit, scare some people, bounce on a bouncy castle and then you realised that's the extent of the fun.Within about an hour your frame rates will drop stupidly, even on a good computer and you'll reset the game out of frustration.The glitches are quaint for about fifteen minutes, the music will drive you nuts and you'll go and play a different game, having lost a few quid.Seriously at most this is worth about £1 of fun.Got get Little and Big instead, it'll probably be cheaper, it's fun for longer and it has story.

												This game is one that is not to be taken too seriously. It is meant for laughs and a enjoyable experience. It is fun trying to do all the missions and challenges that are set out for you. The addition of the GoatZ mod and other mods that are available really make this game one to play when you just want to wind down from really intensive games. However, once you have explored everything it is possible you might feel like there isn't much to do. However i have had a fun time playing it and i would recommend it to others :)			"

												Pros:• Very fun at first• Nice Openworld• Steam Workshop• Pretty Graphics, very nice for an Indie TitleCons:• Gets boring extremely fast• Little to no diversity• Limited Possibilities on Workshop• Vastly Overhyped and very DisappointingGoat Simulator has own basic Formula:Be a Goat.Thats it. You boot up the game, spend the first 15 Minutes in wild ecstasy destroying greenhouses and such, explore the map, discover the different buttons, mess with the inhabitants for a while, and congratulations, youve played Goat Simulator. Even though there are some achievements that are moderately fun to achieve, they become old and pointless quickly, and you are left waiting for someone to create a decent Map/Mod to spice things up a bit. If youre looking for a really, really casual game that you can play for 15 every week for some fun, go for it. The Price is low enough, and youll get what youre looking for.However, if youre looking for a game that doesnt treat you like someone impressed by anything, if youre looking for a challenging, addictive and witty game to play to death, you should definitely pass on this one.

												This game is very entertaining and silly, if you are new to Simulators, I think you should try this out. If you like comedy and funny things, This is good as well.This game is about being a Goat and Just scre'win' around on all kinds of maps.I am a little disappointed in the MMO, since they placed Bots instead of real players. I give that a huge minus.If you think I'm lying, i'm not. Lol. I played this for like... SO MUCH TIME in MMO since I found it interesting, but It is like Single Player since ''everyone'' is a bot... yeah.. I noticed on chat, the makers of MMO made like> HAHAHHAH LOL LOL.They tried to make players sound like they are real, using the trolling words and stuff that everyone says....But it didn't work well, since I found out myself how they faked the real people...I found it very ''insulting'' since it is not real. We waited and voted for the MMO so long, and when it came, it's just a 'faker'.But I still love to play the Single Player and the default maps, it's fun.This game is for you if you like to destroy stuff and kill innocent people... ah..

You only get about thirty minutes of gameplay before you get absoultely bored out of your brain. The price should be at least halved, and at least that way you wouldn't regret buying it so much. Overall, do not buy this game. You can just watch a video or two on it and have exactly the same experience.			"

												It's fun for an hour or so until you realize there's not much to do with the area you're given. Hard to complete certain challenges unless you use a controller, which I don't like to use. You'll get a few laughs out of it but that will pass. Pick it up for cheap if you really want it, if it's full price it's not worth it. Hopefully they will update this with more places to roam.			"

												*DISCLAIMER: Don't jump to the assumption i hate this game because it is different i actually enjoyed the game quiet a lot.*On a scale of 1-10 i cannot give this a rating here are a few reasons why:1: it gets old, very fast.2: It is fairly buggy, but i've never had it crash.3: It has stupid humor that is only enjoyable for about the first half hour of playing.4: There is a ton of potential, but it is going unused. this game could do anything it wants but it just sets you down in a sandbox map and only lets you explore. 5: mods, they give it a little boost of fun but it is very limited of what you can do with mutators. 6: easter eggs, there are a handfull of these like the micheal bay ninja turtles or slender goat.  7: The physics engine is unstable and is the main cause for a lot of bugs. There are many things good and bad that i did not mention because the list would drag on. Over all this is not a game you would spend countless hours on because there isn't anything to do. There is no story line, there are no clear objectives and it looses it charm very fast when you realise that you are litteraly only allowed to do a small handfull of things.			"

												What can I say about this game...It's a simulator of Goats with lots of jokes, gags and easter eggs. It's up to your patience if you discover them all.Thanks to ragdoll it might looks buggy as hell but thats the point. This game supposed to be a joke.I like it. Its fun and for doing totally ""nothing"" or just ""mess around"" it is the right game to play.			"

												Goat Simulator is nothing special. Some people may say I am taking the game to seriously, but I found it to be kind of a disapointment. First, the game's music is AWFUL. It's catchy at first, but then the same 10 notes over and over again gets REALLY old. Also, it gets boring very fast. Sure, you can play as tons of different ""goats,"" but in my opinion, they don't really do anyting, they all seem bland, sure, some can jump higher or run faster, but it stil feels the same. Anyways, I found all the goats, (of what I know of,) in 2 hours or less. I cannot not tell you how boring it has gotten to run around the same map, for 25 minutes, head butting stuff and glitching in walls and tables, sounds fun, but it gets really boring. Now you may say, ""Well we have the Workshop!"" The thing about the Workshop is it hardly has anything. Sure, the game has only been out for 2 or 3 days, but seriously, the Workshop blows. Third, the game just seems unfinished. It does not feel this way because of the glitches, but because of how small the map is, and how some houses and stuff are not able to be broken into. Finally, the in-game achievments are EXTREMELY easy, I got all of  them in about, I'd say, and hour and a half? So in my opinion, this game is not worth the $10. (I believe this is 6.01 quid/punds?) You can say it's meant to be taken seriously, but neither is GMOD, and that's WAY better than this. But the Bay Turdles easter egg is very charming*""It's a joke that shouldn't be taken seriously, yet they want you to pay 10$ for it.How is this game funny and original I really don't know, ragdolls and physics exist since more than 10 years ago. ""lolo u can be a goat haters gonna hate lolxdd best game ever"".Not to mention EVERY single positive review is like ""You can be a goat, wow I learned how to goat, wow this is goaty 2014, wow this changed my life, wow I became a goat"". -TheEngiGuy			"

												The base game is buggy unstructered mayhem that delivers enjoyment on a primal level. It is less of a physics sandbox and more of a physics ballpit: Instead of making anything, the point is to enjoy bright colors and fast-moving objects with little in the way of restrictions or repercussions. Even the limits of Being A Goat are thrown out the window in favor of an endless variety of unlockable animals and entities (which the game assures you are also types of goat).It reminds me a lot of Garry's Mod, but more stable.

												I know. I have only played for a few hours. Mainly because I need to sleep every so often.  :DAnd I will admit to being a 50 year old woman, who enjoys chaos and mayhem, for the sake of chaos and mayhem. :pYou will either love this game or hate it. I really don't think there is any middle ground here.Whacky, and I mean REALLY whacky physics.You play an apparently insane goat who just wants to destroy the world and blow itself up by headbutting cars and gas punps. You like to lick things. Lots of things. Multiple times. And drag them around with your tongue. And sometimes make bombs to blow up whatever you were licking.You can be Queen of the Goats. Devil Goat. 'Nuff said.Wonky, seemingly glitchy and buggy chaotic mayhem. Tons of achievments you will get without ever knowing how ir why you got them. Tons of achievements you will never get, no matter how hard you try (assumption based on global achievements stats...). Lag and severe fps drops. Not sure if this is a glitch, or part of the game. But it makes for interesting Goat predicaments. Absolutely not a serious game.  I have no clue what I am doing in this game. And I am laughing hysterically and loving every second of it! You will. as I said, either love it. Or hate it. I love it.9/10  Would become Devil Goat, Queen of the Goats and blow up a city all over again. Actually, not would. Will.  :D			"

												Goat Simulator is an open world sandbox in the truest since of the word. There are no objectives, no story and not even the possibility of death. Just you and three large maps to explore and cause havoc in. As the name implies you play as a goat that escaped from it's pen. He is far from a normal goat though as he can run on walls, has an incredibly stick tongue and is incapable of death despite being near explosions or falling down absurd heights. This demigoat has no goals and is content just griefing the people that cross its path. The locations it comes across are all very strange and feature aliens, protesting of genital shaped food and a ton of memes. It is a very strange game that relies on you to make your own fun and gives you a comical world to explore with over the top rag-doll physics and tons of secret powers for your goat.Most of the fun comes from how over the top and wacky everything is as well as finding tons of easter eggs. You will never know what to expect around the corner and it is a ton of fun interacting with all the objects like tiny bottle rockets. The goat also has the power to slow down time so you can see the destruction you brought in slow motion. Completing small random events like winning in a goat  sumo match for example grants your goat super strength and that is probably the most sane power. Others let you summon blocks from Minecraft, get a grappling hook or even lets you make goats to rain out of the sky.  Bicycles are ride-able even though you are a goat though controlling it is near impossible. And that is a big part of what keeps this game so much fun, the sheer insanity of it all.One of the three maps was introduced as free dlc and added actual objectives to the area. It is an MMO simulator where you start of by picking your class be it Mage, Rouge and even play as a Microwave along with a few other classes. Each class has their own unique attack and there is a leveling system. Leveling up does near nothing and doesn't really matter since you can't die. There is an inventory system in which you can carry around any object even other characters for later use. This map is very different than the rest as if features elves along with other magical races. The main theme of it is to take part in the long lasting and brutal war between sheep and goats. Though you do not have to take part in anything and can simply mess around like every other map.  One thing I would like to mention is how awesome the chat room in this map is.Graphics are pretty nice as the game is running on the Unreal 3 Engine. Music is very silly and off beat which I imagine would be either love it or hate it type of soundtrack. Physics are over the top and very fun to watch fly around though you may occasionally get your head stuck in objects and watching a goat climb a ladder is equally terrifying and hilarious. It features full controller support and up to four player local coop which is always a blast. Steam Workshop is also integrated into this title allowing you to download new maps, powers and even game-modes such as pinball. There is no blood, gore or even strong language. The most adult joke in this game that I have seen is the no phallic shaped food sign I mentioned earlier. It may be a pretty good title to play with your children since there is 4 player coop and no death only fun. It is pretty buggy though nothing game-breaking, mostly just the physics spazzing out and objects being sent flying by the slightest touch. A score system is in place which you can increase by landing jumps and pretty much doing anything at all. It does nothing and is there just for the heck of it. You can not swim instead you glide along the water like a skipping stone until you reach land again. There are secrets in the water so don't write it off as an annoyance. The NPCs in this game are dumb as rocks and will occasionally get themselves injured though they always get back up. Simply tripping a person sends the community into a panic as they run around screaming due to a goat tripping a man. They have pretty short memories and will usually go back to dancing or whatever they happened to be doing before the goat so rudely tripped someone and is now over there licking a bicycle. That fiend.Overall this is a very strange title to recommend. It is fun for some and boring for others. I personally love it as it reminds me of the days of playing Tony Hawk's freeskate mode with a friend and just jumping over cars and performing insane tricks with no pesky timer only you, a mate and a entire city to cause chaos in. On the other hand I can see why people wouldn't like it as you are just thrown into the world with no objective, story or challenge to be found anywhere. This is definitely the type of game for those of us that spend our youth crashing toy cars instead of racing them, completely ignoring the missions in Grand Theft Auto or were watching action movies while everyone else was still watching Disney. If you fit any of those or just found the contents of this review interesting this game is likely for you.			"

												BEST PARKOUR GAME IN YEARS.Goat simulator is a must-buy if you're bored. (and have ten bucks you dont care about spending) It has one of the funniest physics I've ever seen and you can do pretty much anything you want. I reccomend playing with friends, it will almost quadruple the amounts of laughs you get otherwise. Its a sandbox game, there is no end so it's no surprise if you get bored after a week (or less, depends on what kind of person you are). Trying to get higher scores, finding easter eggs and trying to get all the achievements always leaves you wanting to play somemore.And the Acrobatics/Parkour mechanics are SO much fun. jump from roof to roof, wall climb, wall jump, do 360-backflips, and walk on your front legs. Its so challenging and fun to run across the maps parkouring on everything, even vehicles.But If you're worried that it will only provide you with a very short amount of entertainment and dont want to spend more money buying the DLCs, you can download mods and maps people made on the steam workshop! (or even make mods)This game is a masterpiece to be honest.Basically, Goat Simulator is a low-budget (yet amazing) GTA-like indie game by Coffee Stain Studios. If the devs are reading this, know that I love ya'll and support your amazing work! (especially Mikael!)10/10, Definitely worth the 10 bucks. buy it. Don't buy hoola-hoops or bricks.			"

												This game, by all rights, should be one of the worst games ever, but instead, it's one of the most hilarious and awesome games, lol. Yes, it is actually a bad game....but that doesnt stop it from being addictive, fun, and over the top funny at all. In fact, this is a game that you will ervisit over and over, trying new things, trying to get seemingly impossible achievements until finding success, and generally just wreaking havoc along the way. Who would have thought playing as a goat would be so much fun?I've mostly stuck with Goat Town at this point, although I have run around Goat Town Bay a little bit. The Bay has a bit more glitchy imperfection at this point (I dare say, more than is intended), but I imagine the developers will continue to work on that particular area. Mostly though, when you encounter bugs in the Town, they are intended...or at least, they were intentionally left there to make the game even more quirky, lol.It does have full controller support, which I appreciate.Overall, I would give this game a 9 out of 10. You definitely need to play this game.			"

												All my life I've been searching; searching for something with meaning, something I could tell my grandkids I accomplished with a big grin on my face. Education was always tough for me, I was never any good at sports, I was mediocre at best when it came to music, and making friends just wasn't there for me.  On May 16th I planned to take my life... It was raining outside, I took my Mom's SUV to the local state park near my house. The gate was locked so I just hopped over it with nothing but a rope. I found a nice big oak tree that would guarantee my demise, I tied the noose and put it around my neck while saying to myself ""This is life has no meaning"". IN the moment between life or death I was saved, my phone vibrated and I looked at the notification, ""You have received a gift copy of Goat Simulator"". This was a sign, the sign I was looking for. I ran back to the SUV and raced home with tears in my eyes because finally things were looking up.  I ran upstairs and booted up my PC while nervously tapping my fingers. I downloaded the game while drinking myself drunk with Mountain Dew (diet I might add), and launched the game. I immediately broke down on my knees sobbing at the loading page because in that moment it told me ""You are worth something, you mean something to me"".  After playing the game for a few hours I got a call from an old girlfriend asking if we could make things work, after a few more my Dad came to my room and told me he was going to stop drinking, and finally when I finished the game I walked outside and literally drowned in ♥♥♥♥♥ and hot pockets. Words can't express what this game has done to me, and I hope one day I will be able to repay this game for saving my life, but for now all I can say is; Thanks Goat Simulator.... You're a savior. "

												One of most beautiful games of our time. The heart-wrenching, emmy-nominated story of a goat who wants to have more to life than just eating people and pooping watermellons. He'll go through the necessary struggle of making gas stations blow up, shooting people with a ball launcher, and flying. It's a truely remarkable story, and it will stick with me forever. Goat Simulator receives five goats out of five.			"

												Goat Simulator defines the progress of modern day game development. It completly immerses you in a rich outdoor environment, where your ineractions with people and objects can change the outcome of your world. It well utilizes the reliable Unreal 3 engine and is highly responsive to your actions. I was extremely excited when they announced the 'lick' feature and I was not dissapointed, you can just about lick just about anything and take it with you or even swing it around like a boss. Empowering game with an intuitive system, this has everything I look for in a goat simulator. The developers have made a clear statement with this game, all other publishers and developers need to take heed the bar has been set!10/10			"

Like Potato Crisps/Chips (and allegedly slinky & play-doh), Great Things Come AccidentallyA joke game that's worth every pennyActually I had a hard time believing that the game started as a joke project because the concept is just astounding and brilliant! My propensity for  animals and quriky games aside, this game can get pretty intense with the tricks combo like sports(skate) and rhythm games. Best of all, you can be a grumpy four legged butt hole with horns and a magnetic tongue.Fuels Obsession in the Most Chaoic MannerWith everything flying around me, I found myself obsessing over doing the wrong things right: Bounce only on the trampoline to achieve max height, go around town only via riding a bmx bike with a jetpack, abduct a companion by attaching them by your tongue the whole time while you tackle missions...these are some of the examples of what I determined to get right in the game.Some of my overall positve experienceIncredibly easy to learn and navigateFun artGreat selection of quirky goats and gears comboFunny interaction/response from people to objectsPretty good reaction time when interacting with objectsLove the soundtrackGood game to decompress with: Run around with no expectations or make your own challengesAllows players to have freedom to interact with items/environment comboConsConstantly getting stuck under/in geometry but it looks funny enough that you can't get too mad at it.Conclusion:Take my monies.

												This game is fun. No doubt, but for about 5 minutes. Then again it is quite cheap so it's expected, however I believe the price should be just a little lower, maybe £3.99 instead of £6.99. However, with workshop items and maps available to use for the game, it does provide extra entertainment in exploring maps, using mods and maybe creating the mods for the game that make the game just that little bit more fun. I would recommend it if entertainment is what your after, but don't expect much.			"

												Its funny they said. You will enjoy it they said.This is the worst waste of my time and my money on my Steam account. This game doesn't deserve the praise its gotten.It started a revolution when developers realized you could make more money of a buggy 'hilarious' game than you could a triple a title, and thus cascaded the Steam store with cringeworthy garbage. Unlike Surgeon Simulator and I Am Bread, Goat Simulator has no point, or any goal to get to, and no trials or obstacles to pass. You just knock stuff around and laugh probably once. (Thats being generous.) This game was made for the sole purpose of profiting off autists, and it suceeded distastefully.This game is the bane of my existance and I wish I could give it more negative reviews than one.

In a game where the bugs have status feature, proudly exhibited in the trailers, needless to say that the technique is not perfect. However see a goat flying through the air because of a bug physics something quite satisfying.Goat Simulator can also count on a bunch of mods for a little boost its life and interest.Beyond that, if you like goats, if you like silly games without a goal, and if you like goats, then Goat Simulator is for you.

												I'm not looking to get hate, because I actually enjoy the game. But, here's the thing. While Goat Simulator does a good job making you laugh and blurt at the screen,""Did that..But...I just..."", it fails to keep you occupied. I have played only 2 hours and I feel like I'm done with it. It's certainly not worth the ten dollars, so if you decide after watching a video or two on it, and it's on sale for 5 bucks, that would be a much better deal. I'm sure the game will get better when they start releasing updates,(example being mid-may for local multiplayer/performance/goat parkour) but for now, think twice before you decide to go-at it.			"

												This is one of those games I felt lived up to my expectations and surpassed them. It is definately a great value for the price as I have had a blast playing this game with my four year old who finds the game as hilarious and silly as I do. He quickly learned how to play the game and has been enjoying the open world aspect of it (his favorite type of games). With Steam Workshop already in place and free content already annoumced, I look forward to see what is in store for this game with great delight. When I attempted to set up the controls for this game on a Steam Controller, I did not have much success. I hope to see that changed as I know it would increase how much fun I am having with the game. Better improvement for mods would be nice as it seems a number of them on Steam Workshop require a seperate installation of the game in 64bit. Thankfully the game does have a respawn function when game breaking glitches happen and you are left stranded in objects, in the ground, or in the air. With a game this zany, I would never expect realistic but a little bit better handling on the jumping in the game would be nice. Over all, this game is definately one of the best entertainment values I have stumbled upon in recent history. Sale or no sale, this game is worth every penny.			"

												You know, I've always wondered who buys all those ""simulation"" games. You know the ones, with the same Helvetica Ultra Compressed Italic title font, that offer bogglingly realistic looks at, say, farming, or truck driving, or other very specific career tracks. After doing a bit of research, it would seem to be a split between younger kids, for whom the rough-and-ready big machines appeal is strong, young adults looking into the subject at hand as a possible career idea, and middle-aged guys with a personal connection to the industry in question. Perhaps you want to be a construction worker, or a farmer, or a train engineer, or perhaps you were one once upon a time, before you took that arrow to the knee. Nonetheless, mocked as they tend to be by gamers, these games sell well, so obviously they have a market and they meet its needs.I suppose I'm wondering, then, if I'm a hyperannuated child who dreams of being a goat, a hyperannuated young adult considering a career in being a goat, or a middle-aged man who missed his calling to become a goat, and turns to this game to fulfill an unrequited dream of the yesterday I now can only wish I'd pursued while I was still young and vital, and all paths, including, one must presume, becoming a full-time goat, were available to me. (I'll leave the navel-gazing about my inner longhorn for another review.)Whichever of these *you* may be, however, I suspect you will be well satisfied by this game. Inasmuch as you have any latent, unrealized dreams of being a belligerent ungulate loose in a city's-edge suburb, this simulation will surely help you to actualize them. I'm really impressed by its quality; Coffee Stain claims this is a two-week coder-doodle, but I'm genuinely blown away by the realism, the attention to detail, and the care and craftsmanship of every nuance of my caprine second-life. The transition from trot to gallop shows not only an eye for physics, but an emotional journey for the protagonist, from gaining momentum to finding the rhythm of hooves and stabilizing the new run. It is one thing to create a game that merely *depicts* a goat running; it is another to immerse the player into the experience of being a running goat. I was, well and truly, a running goat, as I played. I felt the years melt away; I have no idea how many, nor whether they were human years or goat years, or what the exchange rate between them might be. I was too busy being a goat to care.This is a sandbox game. If you're looking for direction, you're welcome to follow the achievements trees and let them inspire you, but you need not even pay attention. In the course of your immersive goating, you will surely unlock more and more achievements, just by doing what comes naturally. Don't be afraid to bleat, or ""baah"" as the game calls it; your bleats are limited only by your desire to bleat, and this isn't some kind of goat-themed roleplaying game; you need not wait for your bleat meter to replenish to do it again. Timing headbutts during a charge can be tricky, yes, but again, this is not a goat-themed action game, it's a *simulation*. You'll get the hang of it soon enough, just keep trying. Don't worry, there are many, many things to butt, stomp, scatter and abuse.While you can certainly play the game in metadialogue with the protagonist, imagining yourself merely a spectral guide inspiring a goat who is not, in fact, yourself to move, bleat, butt, and grab things with a curiously elastic froglike tongue -- this is a mystery of goathood of which I had been previously unenlightened, and it was a surprise to me -- you will surely enjoy the game more if you let the simulation run wild in your imagination. For those of us without years of Stanislavsky Method training, this is well and truly our golden ticket into the mind, horns and hooves of the goat. Embrace the goat. Become one with the goat. To do less would be to fail to actualize the potential of this masterpiece of simulation.I ran as a goat. I headbutted as a goat. I climbed as a goat. I climbed *ladders* as a goat. And when that truck barreled out of the tunnel toward me, I didn't look up at it and see a giant rolling metal deathbringer. Oh no. I was a *goat*, baby, and all I saw was a rival in full charge. I bleated. I lowered my head. And I charged that sorry Peterbilt with the mightiest butt I could manage. Were there a nanny goat present, I would have surely emerged the dominant male from that challenge!I can't really speculate as to how well this game prepares one for becoming a goat professionally, as I have no plans to use this simulation as career training, as many do. Since it bears the textual laurels of the Helvetica Ultra Compressed Italic font on its cover and splash screen, however, I am fully confident that, like the mighty Microsoft Flight Simulator before it, it will prove useful to goats-in-training, although it may require specialized input hardware for a more realistic experience, as MSFS did. (I have no idea what specialized goat-simulation hardware looks like, maybe some of you awesome hardware experts can help me here.)I was not aware that I yearned to life a double life as a goat before playing this simulation game. After playing it, I remain no more convinced, really, that I ever wanted to be a goat. But if I did want to be a goat, this simulation would well and truly satisfy that desire in a deep, meaningful, lasting, and enlightening way. I can recommend this game not only to would-be goats, but even to those merely curious about what their lives might have been like, if they had chosen to be goats. I can even recommend the game to those who are merely curious as to what ""being a goat"" entails, and I suspect that the many souls who plunk down ten bucks just to see what all the fuss is about will want away both entertained and a little wiser.The line between simulation and reality becomes more and more fuzzy with every passing year. I shudder to think how many concussions this game could virtually induce if Oculus Rift support appears, down the line. The goat of tomorrow has finally arrived. Thank you so much, Coffee Stain!			"

												Very amusing funny game.I saw this game trailer before it was released and laughed so much I had to play it.The game itself really is pointless, it has no story driven aspect to the game only to be amusing and make you laugh for a few minutes to hours.  Depending on your sense of humour.The graphics are alright, they are not bad but not amazing. They are good for what the game offers.The controls are easy to grasp and get used too.The audio is spot on and really funny.The game itself is just so enjoyable running around doing stupid stuff.  I would not call it a game.... More or less and app to amuse you and make you laugh.  It is how I see it.There is no multiplayer yet but a mod is currently being worked on, the same goes for local coop with a friend.The game is not big and is a tiny world, and from this fun I hope a number 2 comes with a larger world to explore and find things with a friend.It really is top fun and worth a mess around.  I even streamed it for people and made them laugh.Would I recommned it? Yes!			"

												This game is deeper than it would let us believe. The default map takes us to an area that straddles between an industrious and cosmopolitan city and the rural farm communities and suburbs. And as we quickly learn in this utter masterpiece, neither community is spared from the righteous fury of mother nature. Regardless of social-economic status, race, creed, the ever constant force of the universe will cut them all down in a sweeping and often chaotic gesture.Forests will grow and die,Oceans will form and dry away,Towering mountains will erode away into sand,The most humble of peasants, and even the mightiest of kings will grow old and die,And the twinkling stars that seem like our eternal audience will eventually burn out.You must purchase this game and experience the raw essence depicted within, and although you will not fully come to understand the universe around us by it alone, you will nevertheless acquire another small piece to the grand puzzle we call life.

												It's abundantly clear from the title (and the internet hype) that this game is silly, pure and unadulterated silliness. I make no apologies for saying that's enough to sell it to me. But is the game any good? What does it do? Is it worth buying (being perhaps the ultimate question)?Let's tackle what it is. Well, it says on the tin, as it were. It's a sandbox bugger-about (if that isn't a genre it damned well should be). Your goat emulates Tony Hawk in a rather straightforward (but oddly-sounding) way - you can jump, flip, headbutt, and lick - the latter which allow you to pick things up and wander around with them, flailing-weapon-like. As already stated, it's a free-for-all bugger around in a sandbox townscape. There are some collectables to find, game mode tweaks to unlock, and special tricks (usually with accompanying in-jokes) to perform; the latter being the real meat of the game.Is it any good, though? Yes and no.As before, it's patently obvious what it is, but the real downsides are that there is so little content here. The single environment is sadly very small, so you can easily find every nook and cranny therein within a couple of hours. But, somewhat worse, it does tend to tire some time before that; in other words, the chuckles wear thin fairly quickly, as they do with any joke once heard or experienced the first time. So, in such cases, you NEED something else to offer to fall back on, and sadly there just isn't enough for that.The tricks you need to perform (they are sequential, so you need to perform a given trick successfully before the next one appears) can also be romped through in short shrift, especially once you quickly work out the best places for performing them.So, the final question, is it worth buying? Well, the answer isn't really straightforward as it entirely depends on your own perspective.If you are OK with a couple of hours at best of silly entertainment, and the price is acceptable, then by all means go for it. It is what it is. The only warning I will add to this is to be prepared for some bad framerate issues - it isn't optimized at all at this point. My main desktop (a couple of years old) will potter along acceptably, if you consider drops to 30 FPS acceptable when you've busted up a few things (which means frequently). On my laptop which is above minimum recommended specs, forget it. 10 FPS is about it. That's the only real thing to beware.However, if you are a little more careful and considered with your purchases, then I would offer you a firm ""no"" for buying it - at least not yet.There's a couple of major reasons I say not yet. Firstly, the obvious one being as with all things Steam, a sale is imminent and there will be promotion soon enough. Secondly, from my experience with Coffee Stain studios, they are generally good guys. I bought Sanctum when it released, and the content was 3 (or maybe 4) maps at that time, but they added and updated repeatedly right up to the time before Sanctum2's release, so as far as money's-worth I DEFINITELY got it, as all this content was free. Their DLC was generous too, as they asked what we wanted to see as DLC and listened - so maps, in general, and they were well priced.I have no doubt they'll be adding to this game (and as of today have confirmed more free content for May), so it will improve. There is also the point that it has Steam Workshop support, and mods have been coming in pretty quick already, so I have no doubt this will be pretty well supported and will grow.So in summary, I'd urge to wait and get it in a couple of months.

												Goat Simulator is a joke of a game. You take control of a goat in a small town with absurd physics. A simple headbutt from the goat will blow up a car. The goat can climb ladders effortlessly and drag objects around with its tongue. The town is basically a small sandbox with several hours of things to do, but not much more than that.Goat Simulator is small, deliberately unpolished and buggy and its design is simple. But it is a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map.It is hard to recommend this game or even describe it, it is such a visual experience that you really should take a look at a video before buying and after that, either you want to move on, or you really need to play this game.Sounds 4/10Graphics 7/10Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA "

												Goat Simulator is a misnomer. This is not a simulator of true goat life. This game is more like the Dark Souls of goat simulation and could be the deepest non-linear action rpg of our time.You start out in an open field with perhaps the most cliched of beginings, the amnesiac hero. Much in the vein of dark souls you know little about the world to begin with and will learn more through close observation of details. What's the deal with the standing stone circle? Who is behind the sinister experiments in the anti gravity science facilty? These are questions that you'll answer in your journey along with many more.Narrative is driven purely through your interactions with npcs. This is some of the best npc interaction I have seen as each npc has their own digital life and routine and they will remember your past interactions. Did you headbutt Kyle earlier? Well he's staying headbutted. The only gripe I have with the NPCs is that the AI is particularly poor and they only react directly to the player rather than to the world around them. However due to the non-linear nature of the game and story, this should be forgiven.Graphics are great and highly stylised. The world is vibrant and full of colour, making it easy to distinguish objects on screen. Likewise, the music is perfect and even contextual, ramping up at times of extreme action. Final word: Simple to learn, difficult to master with engaging gameplay and a deep and compelling non-linear narrative, Goat Simulator is a modern day classic and a must buy for all gamers, casual or hardcore.Score: 10/Goat			"

												Thoroughly enjoyed Goat Simulator 2014. Goat/10.Goat Simulator 2014 gives an in-depth experience that uses a wide range of engaging stimulus and challenges to educate us humans of the agricultural environment that a goat must endure through it's life. The inspiring story of Goat overcoming his/her oppressors (the humans) creates an amazing storyline, with numerous plot twists that will have you on the edge of your seat. I know what you're thinking, ""but its just a goat!"" Shut the hell up you fool, although this may be 'just a goat', this is 'just a goat' that broke through its goat expectations and stereotypes to face the world with nothing but its hyper-elastic tongue and it's oddly unnatural ability to not die. Ever. Goat Simulator 2014 expertly demonstrates how political views and actions can affect not only mankind, but also goats. It confronts the player with many terrifying situations (and can at times cause great offense). One example of this is the many rules and regulations imposed by the goverment, like what the hell? You want to keep me in this goat pen? Do you think this tower will keep me happy? This game allows you to fight the power, and essentially ""♥♥♥♥ the police"". The most controversial aspect of this game is most definitely the goat fight scene, where you must turn against your fellow goats for the pleasure of the humans. Who really wants to participate in a competitive blood bath of goats for someone else's entertainment? In my honest opinion, I would much rather prefer that to not be a part of the game. Although I may not be condoning goat on goat violence, I find mowing down the many so called 'innocent' civilians and sacrificing them to the Lord Satan gives me an enjoyable rush. This game has the potential to inspire many, whether they want to become a goat scientist, goat gymnast, goat astronaut, goat ball pitcher or whale, they will find this game absolutely enthralling. The Good Goat VS Bad Goat dynamic of Goat Simulator gives the player the ability to influence the goat's decisions, and essentially determine to be Good Goat, or Bad Goat. (I also have the sneaking suspicions that recent games such as Infamous: SECOND SUN (what does that even mean?) have copied this genius game mechanic from Goat Simulator 2014.)  I recommend this game as it accurately depicts the various aspects of survival that a goat must face in it's day to life, and does so in a way that us humans can relate to and take advice from in both an entertaining and interesting way. This game forces you to think. I love it. "

												Goat Simulator is the pinnacle of goat simulation. Every aspiring goat simulation software developer should look up to Coffee Stain Studios and set Goat Simulator as an example for their future goat simulation projects. Although I believe such a timeless piece of goat simulation software will not be surpassed for many years to come, shining a guiding light for all who wish to deliver a better experience in goat simulation.Goat Simulator is definitely not the Game Of The Year. It is much, much more than that. I have no doubt anyone would agree that Goat Simulator is the Game Of All Time. Indeed, Goat Simulator is the GOAT.			"

												Here you are once more, on the Goat Simulator page on Steam. No... no, don't leave yet. Stay awhile -- relax a bit, have some tea. Chamomile perhaps? It was always a favorite of mine, back in the old days in the Romanian countryside, where I grew to manhood alongside Scruffles, my pet bear. Scruffles was a gentle bear for the most part, but he was a deeply troubled soul. I could not forsee what terrible things he would do to that family. Sometimes I think back on it and wonder what more I could have done for him; wonder if there were any signs that I missed, or if I had ever been unkind to him in any way...Oh, but I forget myself again. I apologize. Let me stoke the fire one moment.... there... now where were we? Oh yes, the game. Yes, here you are once more, perhaps after a few days, or maybe even months. You've heard whispers about it, you've seen the videos, and perhaps you even watched a friend play it. You saw it listed once, you clicked on it -- you debated on whether or not you should dip into the money you were saving for your wifes anniversary dinner. Or perhaps you scoffed, your nose held high, unwilling to part with your hard earned cash in exchange for this utter rubbish. Whatever the case, you're back here, aren't you?Is it a Steam sale that now draws your attention? Perhaps it's always been on your list of games to buy? Or has the morbid curiosity in you reached that point of no return? Are you unable to restrain yourself from clicking that purchase button? Are you even okay?Don't answer that last question; you ARE okay. You will be okay. Everything from now on will always be.... okay. You see it wasn't just you that brought you back here for what could possibly be the fifth time... it was Goat. You don't know Goat, except that you do. Goat has always been with you, whether you're aware of it or not. The lingering presence, the angel on your shoulder, the devil in your gut -- all of it was Goat. Goat has been with you in your dreams. Goat was with you during your SAT's. Goat was there when you stood beside the pastor and watched your beloved walk down the isle.Goat was there. Goat was always there.And here you are again, reading this review, wondering whether or not you should purchase Goat Simulator; wondering if it will fullfill you in ways only few other games have. Or maybe you just wonder why you're back here again, after so many other visits, trying to figure out just what it is that compells you to return. Well there are no more questions you need to ask yourself now is there? There are no more questions because suddenly the way is clear.Goat is calling you home. From the moment you were born, Goat has been there with you, watching over you, waiting until you were worthy of the glory that lies beyond the purchase button. Every time you nearly touched it, it was Goat that slapped your hand away.... because you were not yet ready for the greatness. But Goat is calling you, and you can hear him now. Goat is waiting for you on the other side. The great beyond lies waiting for you -- it is a place of light, healing, transcendance... and whales. Lots, and lots of whales.But above all the great beyond is that one place you've always been walking towards though you never really knew it. It's Eden. It's Valhalla. It's the Stars. It's Goat Simulator.Come home to the great beyond. Come home to Goat. "

												This game confuses me, I lick people and they like it but in real life I get called a 'child molester' and get pepper sprayed. I believe I was born to be a goat. This is my calling in life, this game is gods way of telling me. Tonight is the night I end it all and come back as my inner goat. I will not even die as I throw myself off my roof, I will get saved by my ragdoll physics and HD realistic and ever so buggy neck. I will be a goat. It will be glorious.			"

												the world around me was a mess trouble around every corner what could i do to fix it I had a good life The best life I could ask for in this crazy world  I had the freedom to do whatever i liked I jumped over fences when I pleased Hit things with my head licked bikes licked cars licked people licked whatever I wanted but everything changed that day The day I found A jetpack I was no longer confined to the ground Now there where no limits to where I could go what I could do I now had the power to make a change The world below was a mess and I was flying high above watching over it Helping the humans when they needed it most the humans didn't take kindly to me  shunned my new found power watching me with their judging eyes""he is a menace to society"" they would scream  ""A goat can't be a super hero"" they would yell as I carried them to safety So I run I run from them I hid far from their eyes But I'm still there watching waiting for them to need me again Because I'm the hero this town deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So they forgot about me and lived thier lifes make Nothing happened because I can take it. Because I'm not their hero. I'm a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A Goat.			"

												A sad story of a goat who falls from glory in this heart breaking tale of shakespiran wonder. I don't want to give much away from its deep and mystrious story. Never before has a game made me cry as much as Goat Simulator has in the time i have played it. Truly Goat Simulalor as a game to play played and shall contunue to be as infulental to gaming as such giants as Deus Ex. The only comparison to this game that i can think of is to Citizen Cane as it defines a medum as an art somthing to be taken seriously. The soundtrack fits its darring atmostphere to the letter, bringing out the emotinons in us all. God bless Coffie Stains Studios they have a true master peice on there hands and i can't wait for the sequel as the clifhanger is still driving me crazy. -10/10 its a must buy			"

												A true 2014 masterpiece.  It's hard to come to terms with the sheer magnitude of perfection this game offers to the world of want-to-be-goats.  But I will give it a shot.Story:  A gripping tale of love and betrayal, told from the perspective of a goat that must decide between his compassionate, love-driven upbringing and the dark, brooding forces that conspire to take him over.  10/10Graphics:  The goat has never been portrayed more accurately and in such an eye-pleasing way.  The game transcends what was once thought possible about depicting these fine creatures in gaming.  How many other games have you seen that feature goats so prominently?  That's because it is far too complex a task for any normal developer.  10/10Soundtrack:  The score of this game never fails to give the audience 100% immersion into the goat's perspective.  The music ranges from cheerful to borderline sinister.  It really draws the audience into how the goat feels at all times.  10/10Gameplay:  You are a goat.  You have at your disposal the tools necessary for destroying everything anyone has ever loved.  Could you possibly ask for anything else?  10/10Overall:  Do you like an engaging story?  Do you enjoy being truly immersed in a game by its versatile soundtrack and setting?  Do you want to be a god-forsaken goat?  This is the game for you.  Delete everything else off your machine, lock your doors, say goodbye to your loved ones:  from now on, this is your life.  11/10			"

Not that it wasn't what I expected, but that the area to knock things around in is a sandbox, but sized for an ant.  5 minutes to completely explore the map, with little else to do than knock things down & watch ragdolls go stupidly flying.  If you want to watch facepalm worthy physics, & actually get some play time, Skyrim is still on sale.			"

												This is a fun game with a lot of laughs, but they don't last very long.I personally dislike resorting to downloading workshop content for extra things to work with in game, you may disagree but the content Goat Simulator offers is very little. The music and background don't really interest me at all, other than finding new things to explode or faff about with.My favorite thing about this game would be the Ludicrous physics and insane amount of laughs that again, don't last long without the workshop. Other than that nothing stands out. Maybe it's because I haven't played the game enough but this is all I have to say for now.4/10			"

												As soon as I had woken up, the bright light shined around me, as I came flying down the street on the back of a truck. Held by my tongue I began to build up speed and entered the bright Valhalla, also known as the petrol station. The man at the desk just gave me a death stare, as I flew through screaming and vigorously taking out the entire station leaving it in flames. I had became the true goat lord, prepared for anything and now I am ready for the world, and for my people.Unfortunately you can't play as a goat in this game, but you can play as a goat so it makes up for it.You should try this game out, it really has goat to be funI rate this game Goat/10, for it's extremely dynamic game play, quick time events and realistic physics.

												Goat Simulator began as a joke. This joke has now snowballed into what may be the greatest game of all time. Just when you think it can't get any weirder, this game will blow your mind. It has references to nearly every geeky thing you can think of, from The IT Crowd to South Park to Bravest Warriors.A lot of games out there have stupid achievements. As a completionist, I feel compelled to 100% each game in my collection even though it kills me a little inside. With Goat Simulator, you can breeze through all the achievements in a few hours if that's what you want - the mutations make it super easy. But I didn't take the easy route. For all its frustrating bits, I wanted to do everything this game has to offer, and I wanted to do it legit. Aside from a few gems like Super Meat Boy and VVVVVV, not many games can do that.If you want hours upon hours of replayable, sandboxy goodness with the option of getting serious now and then, Goat Simulator is for you.

This game relys on the WTF LOL moments but if you miss a joke, you miss that joke for good. Because it probally refers to a trophy and if you want that trophy you must search for it online and if that happens it looses that WTF Moment. My Personal ExperienceThe First World Boring as I saw everything on YoutubeThe Second Beach World I enjoyed it, as everything was new the FIRST time. Afterwards it was boring. I got maybe 6 fun hours from the experience.Free MMO UpdateFun for the first 8 hours.Payday DLC Fun for the first 4 Hours.

												This game is some great sandbox fun as a goat.Theres no actual story, just objectives given to you and you'll have to carry it out as a goat, you can ragdoll, slow down time, jump around, find jetpacks, find tennis ball launchers etc. You headbut cars they explode so on and people quote dumb phrases as you hit them, there is no better word to describe this game then that it'll melt your brain. Just read the other peoples review and you'll see what I mean.For 10 dollar it is not bad for some ridiculously bad goofy fun.+ controls are really basic and easy to learn only a few buttons.+ Goat can do anything+ Be a goat+ Do whatever you want+ Catchy Music+An actual simulator that beats all other simulators because its fun.+I felt stupider every time i turn this on for some quick fun- Need a story please!, cant wait for a good one- Hopefully a huge overhaul on graphics and physics can't wait			"

												Every few years a game comes around, a game with wisdom, knowledge, redemption. With a story so thought provoking and intense you cannot help but cry a bit. A game that turns boys into men and girls into women. A game that sets the bar for future generations of games. Games like Super Mario Bros, Doom, Final Fantasy, and now Goat Simulator. ….. ok not really but it is a game about being a goat and you get to go destroy things, so it's still pretty awesome. Just finished my first run through (and trust me I ran through a lot of stuff XD) and I enjoyed it, for something so silly it is surprisingly fun. A lot of hidden things to find and hidden jokes if you take the time to look around. And you can always reset the world and try destroying things differently. Not to mention it has workshop support so who knows what the community will add.  If you want a fun crazy goat related experience that you can play over and over just go ahead and slap down 10 bucks and enjoy yourself, after all you may be a goat in your next life better be prepared!**(Reincarnation is not necessarily the belief of the reviewer, nor is he saying that this is in fact true or false. However for purposes of a joke he has put it in.) "

												I feel like Goat Simulator was overhyped. Sure it looks cute and fun with its silly goat protagonist and a general goofyness to the world. But there are only two area's in the game and if you don't have a fantastic computer this game runs like s***. To add on top of it the people in game are irritatating. Sure, it might be funny to hear ""I was sacrifice by that goat!"" ONCE. But when they repeat it over and over It just makes everyone else in the game to seem like lifeless puppets. Though not entirely related to the review the scream they use in the game must be some sort of royalty free scream because I've heard it in other games like SCP Containment Breach. And trust me, once you played that the scream does not fit in this game at all. Overall I just felt like I was getting achievements and had no other goal or fun thing to do other then that. It might entertain you for a few days but then it will soon be forgotten. Buy it on sale, but otherwise I couldn't reccomend.TL;DRPros-Goats-Physics-Sacrifice?Cons-Expensive Computer-Weird Voice Acting-Doesn't entertain for very long.6/10			"

												Quite possibly the best goat simulator I've ever played, no seriously!But seriously, remember back in the old days, when games were fun. We just played...for fun, spending hours playing certain games with no MP features just because they were great fun to play. These days, most games fail hardly at meeting that demand, half the time the games we play these days are MP, and we only do so to `get to the next level` or `unlock the next item` or we paly them simply because our friends are playing them.This game is unique, it succesfully fills that cliche of just being a thing to play on your own, for fun!However that said, there are some negatives. The map feels small, and the current stuff to do is fairly limiting. Providing the game gets updated with little bits of content from the workshop or the devs, I'm sure this game will continue to thrive, and remain my favourite 15 minute time killer.Also, the lack of being able to eat grass and poop is disturbing for a goat simulator. Please add that one!!Kog			"

												I'm a little late to this review, and, in a way, that's almost a good thing.You've probably heard about this game through: YouTube, Tumblr, Reddit, Your mate, Your mate's mate or your Mate's Mate's Mate's mate. Everyone praises this game, hail goat simulater! Lol 10 of- lol so random funny lol glitchy random funny lol ten random funny lol yolo! This game isn't funny, it really isn't if I can quote NerdCubed here ""This game isn't YOLO it's LOLO, laugh out loud once, at one point you'll laugh once ""Heh, man fell down"" and thats it."" And it's true, the main punchline, man fell down, game is teh glitch, and you may chuckle... Once, then after that this game just keeps pushing, and pushing, and PUSHING thats same joke down you ♥♥♥♥ing throat as you choke to death on a man falling down, and random glitches. The 1 defense is: ""Oh, but it's supposed to be glitchy, it's parodying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ simulators"" No! No no no! You see, if you try to make a bad game and succeed, then you've made a bad game (another Nerd3 quote) This game isn't parodying anthing, it's just adding to the pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""Simulators"" This is a game that was funny to some 12 year old, and then once Pewdiepie played it, the cult leader of the braindead 12 year old, ""lol yolo 10 funny ranomd lol!"" gang. Basically, you know that one kid at any school, that said some ""Joke"" that he thought was funny, wether it be towards someone or not, he said that ""Joke"" and one kid barley chuckled, and something clicks ""Oh my god, someone- someone ♥♥♥♥ing laughed, I must be the funniest person ever!"" And then every. Single. Day, he just said, and said, and said that joke over and over and over and over an over again. It wasn't funny the first time when that 1 out of 8 NPC models fell down, it wasn't funny when the goat flew out of the map, it was just annoying.Goat Simulator: ""The bane of the ♥♥♥♥ing universe!""2/10And now I prepare for all the fans, rating this review down, and calling me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥, because that's what 12 year old's do.

												I'm not even sure whether to recommend this game or not. I understand that the main goal of this game are open world havoc for fun. There're a lot of silly effects and you can do funny things. But I didn't get the fun. I'm totally bored with the game, and it gets worst with the MMO Simulator update.I understand that they're trying to add something to do in-game rather than just pointlessly creating ruckus in the middle of the town. I guess that's just because there's nothing to do ? I'm not the achievement kind of guy. I don't really care about pursuing achievements since it gives you nothing. The graphics are okay, the gameplay is rather pointless, and I think the game's effort to give me fun is a huge fail. I saw a lot of positive reviews from other people and most of them don't play for long. This game is best fit to fill your free time when you're bored playing anything. But if you're also bored of crazy goats,walking toilets and two-legged microwave, this game will become totally useless.Note : Please,people.Do not give thumbs down to my review only because I didn't recommend your beloved game.Everyone has their right to express their opinion about the game in the review section.Remember the thumbs up or down is about whether my review is HELPFUL or NOT.It's not about whether I recommend a game you like or not.What's the point of rating my review if you love the game ? Why are you reading reviews if you love the game ? Why do you even read reviews when you ALREADY have the game ? I suppose a lot of people intentionally giving thumbs down because they hate people who aren't recommending a game they like.Maybe they're trying to cover up the bads of the game ? My review is for the people who don't know what kind of game is this and I want to help them to decide whether to buy this game or not.THAT is the purpose of a review.I truly hope you people are educated enough to comprehend this and STOP giving bad ratings to reviews that don't recommend a game you like.

												This game is honestly the biggest buyer's remorse I've ever had fo a game. It's funny... For five minutes. I'd bought it for about £7 and spent ten minutes on it before getting bored. The controls are pretty terrible. It's a pain trying to control the goat and get it to do what you want it to. The game itself is also pretty glitchy.The joke wears thin very fast, which is the game's main selling point. I mean, there's only so many times you can watch a goat blow up. The worst thing about it is the price. In no way is this game worth £7. This is the most I've spent on a game on Steam (I'm not a heavy PC gamer) and it's the only game I feel I've wasted money on.I don't really recommend this game at all but if you desperately must try it, please don't spend over £3 for it.

That's right, I've never gotten so bored of a game so quickly.This proves that games that are jokes, ""not games scattered with memes, unlike binding of issac""have literally no playability.So why is a game that's a joke in a sandbox section, I don't know. But the game has been out for FOUR months, and still has little content. The default content is boring, community workshop is good, but you gotta have the right videocard or else the map or content will crash.Also, every account on youtube is playing this game. It's not funny anymore, it was funny, on day 1. But not anymore, glad this isn't in the top sellers list anymore.			"

												Although you may know how to talk the talk and walk the walk... BUT can you goat the goat?Goat Simulator is a game of adventure, love, heartbreak, suspense, murder, and any other type of genre you can think of. You play as an indebted detective known as Bookshelf DeGoat sent on a mission by the iconic lettuce triplets to bring them the girl and wipe away the debt. You jump in a rocket and fly up to the floating haven (and by haven I mean sweat shop) of Alaska. Once there you will begin to notice the high amounts of patriotism and overpriced T-shirts manufactured by Starbucks. You learn about their leader, Celery Q. Cumquat, you enter a raffle then win only to find out you are known as the False Sheep. You fight hordes and hordes of Cumquat's men to reach the girl known as Goatlizabeth. As the duo run around the city of Alaska Goatlizabeth is shown to have supernatural powers to open ripples in space-time simply referred to as tears.I could go on about the plot but I won't spoil the rest of it for you. All I can say is that this is the greatest entry in Baashock franchise yet.Goat out of twelve-ty two would most certainly bangGoatOfTheYear			"

												What does it mean, to be alive?  On a biological level this can be answered easily, but it becomes harder to answer as we approach it more philosphically.  Is life not constructed of the same matter as the rest of the universe?  Does a dead body not have the same amount of atoms as a living body?  Can you measure the soul?  Is sentience, nay, is consciousness something a living being can truly attain?  In the face of the infinite void of the universe, can a human claim to know anything at all?  Can a human truly understand anything, or is all of our culture and history nothing more than the filthy residue of our species' unending drive to eat, ♥♥♥♥, and kill?  Can any man claim to be superior to another man, to an ape, a goat, a snake, an ant?  Should we as a species be proud of our dominance over the Earth?  Have we, through our actions, proven to be noble and gracious caretakers of the only home we have?  I think not.  No, a man is nothing more than an unthinking beast with ersatz free will.  Mankind is a nuclear wolf wearing the skin of God, barking at itself in the mirror in a locked room full of its own excrement. Barking louder and louder, bared fangs slobbering radioactive saliva, until it's idiotic madness causes it's own heart to detonate.It is time to remove the mask of yourself.  Rip away the insincere facade of humanity from your ego.  Your leg is caught in the beartrap of society, and if you don't gnaw your leg off your spirit will starve to death.  Become the beast you already know you should be, deep down inside, and the taste in your mouth won't be your own blood, it will be the taste of freedom.  Play Goat Simulator.			"

												My first 5 minutes in the game should say enough...After a few short moments I was running around causing some good old Goat brand havoc. Headbutting cars, headbutting people into cars, licking random strangers and sharp objects. Even chasing strangers with random sharp objects.  While ceaselessly headbutting my way through the construction site I noticed a ladder on the backside of the sky crane. Without second thought, I scampered my body up it. Wobbly head and all.As the wind whipped around my stubby little legs and my head finally stopped twitching underneath my bloated belly due to smacking into the ladders rungs, I reached the first platform on the crane. Looking down back onto the construction site I couldn't help but see two NPCs standing... just standing.. It was as though the simple idle animations of fist pumping and partying were mocking me.So, I did what any good, reasonable and upstanding goat would do; I jumped on the woman first. Sending her into a nearby trampoline which ejected her into parts unknown.As my flailing body began to regain its balance and find its footing, I mashed the 1 key and tried to let out a long ""BAAAAAAA"" but instead belched out one of those Viral video goat screams which came off more like the attack cry of a minion from the 6th circle of Hell . The Fist pumping♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥nozzle was, of coarse by now, running full tilt and screeching bloody murder at the tops of his lungs.Unfortunately he didn't make it far as I began to mash E (lick) in his direction while flipping through the air screaming at him like some sort of nightmarish jet fuel.Somehow, I managed to grab hold of an explosive tank on the underside of my flip which sent the tank over my head with the momentum of my body and crashing to the ground with enough force to detonate the canister.... right next to a few more..Needless to say, the man was never seen again, I only caught a quick frame of him flying away at subsonic speeds engulfed in flames.I however was sent in the opposite direction and straight into the nearby gas station.I couldn't help but mash that magical ""baaaa"" key again followed quickly by the slow motion button.As my lifeless goat simulaid flew threw the air away from one explosion and was certain to cause another in a moment; I could only describe the scene as a Jon Woo ballet featuring a goat.. looking deeply into my slo-mo, crossed eyed screaming Billy...I knew I was in love.Pressing the slow motion key again, I flew head first at break neck speeds into a gas pump, sending the entire station up in a plume of smoke, debris and heat.MICHEAL BAY flashed on the screen as a combo multiplier.I hit escape.Sat for a moment.Let what I just did/witnessed sink in.Took a deep breath.Slid out of my chair.And laughed for five minutes on the floor.

Can a human truly understand anything, or is all of our culture and history nothing more than the filthy residue of our species' unending drive to eat, ♥♥♥♥, and kill?  Can any man claim to be superior to another man, to an ape, a goat, a snake, an ant?  Should we as a species be proud of our dominance over the Earth?  Have we, through our actions, proven to be noble and gracious caretakers of the only home we have?  I think not.  No, a man is nothing more than an unthinking beast with ersatz free will.  Mankind is a nuclear wolf wearing the skin of God, barking at itself in the mirror in a locked room full of its own excrement. Barking louder and louder, bared fangs slobbering radioactive saliva, until it's idiotic madness causes it's own heart to detonate.It is time to remove the mask of yourself.  Rip away the insincere facade of humanity from your ego.  Your leg is caught in the beartrap of society, and if you don't gnaw your leg off your spirit will starve to death.  Become the beast you already know you should be, deep down inside, and the taste in your mouth won't be your own blood, it will be the taste of freedom.  Play Goat Simulator.			"

												Alright, so this my first time reviewing a game on Steam, and I felt I had to do it because this game is really awesome. It's huge in every sense of the word - long, hard (that's what she said :P) and has a level of freedom you wouldn't expect from a game more than ten years old. You can do pretty much everything you want - sleep, grill meat, forge weapons, make potions, skin animals and take their teeth and even smoke pot and sell it for profit - and go anywhere you want in the game's world without a quest asking you to go there.The sun rises and sets, NPC sleep, wake up, work, gather to talk with each other, etc. etc.Being a simulator, the development of the character is always important in such a genre, and Goat simulator really shines in that department. You start as a poor weakling who gets beaten up by everyone and hardly can kick harmless little creatures called meatbugs. Then, as you complete quests and defeat enemies, you gain XP which can be converted in strength, dexterity and mana points. You go all the way to a badass warrior, a lethal ranger or a supreme mage - you chose how you want to play it.As for the bad parts, I just can think of one: the game is VERY buggy, and that can totally ruin your game experience if you don't know how to avoid it.A few important considerations about the game if you want to play and enjoy it:- Steam doesn't provide a game manual for Goat sim, and that truly sucks. If there are some games which you can start playing without reading the manual first - most modern games carry in-game tutorials - this is NOT one of them. The controls are a bit akward and if you don't read about them first I guarantee you won't be able to play the game at all. Just visit the Steam community page and you'll easily find a link to download the official manual in PDF.- You can and you SHOULD run the game on Windows 7. My desktop computer is a Pentium IV with Windows XP, and I thought It would be better choice for this game to avoid system compatibility issues. Well, that was a mistake. The game kept crashing anywhere between 5 and 30 minutes of gameplay, especially when facing multiple foes, not to mention some inventory items didn't even show the picture. I googled it and updated all my Nvidia and sound card drivers, but the problems aforementioned remained unchanged. I was very close to quit playing the game at all, but I thought what the heck, let me try it on my laptop which runs on W 7. It got A LOT better. It only crashed about 10% of the time (ah ah), especially during the first visit to the Sleeper's temple (be sure to save a lot there) and the inventory issue got fixed. I don't know about Vista or 8, but the game seems to like Windows 7. Oh, and make sure to disable Steam interface during gameplay, or the game might not start at all.- The game allows you to save whenever you want, so make sure you take advantage of it. I suggest this not for cheating purposes, but to avoid losing your game progress due to a crash or even worse, some bug where a gate doesn't open when it was supposed to or you end up killing NPCs vital to the plot who shouldn't be allowed to die at that point of the game.- Get a walkthrough. I suggest the one by JemyM, which you can easily find online. Again, I recommend it not for cheating (you can even skip the walkthrough part per se) but for the unvaluable information it contains regarding gameplay and common bugs and how to avoid them.- Go to a place like steamcommunity.com and download the map pictures. Trust me, you will need them.- If you're more into action games, maybe this game is not for you. Through most part of the game (especially the first chapters), you keep running from place to place around the colony, doing chores for other people, looking for objects, etc. Sure, later you'll feel like an invencible killing machine - it felt VERY rewarding going back to the Old Camp and slaughtering all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who mugged me in the beginning :P - but it takes a while to get there. Play this game for the RPG experience and the story, and you will enjoy it.			"

												This game is a gem. The developers are completely open and honest: this game is broke beyond repair, everything glitches, things don't work, the physics are absurd and I LOVE IT. For 9.99 I have enjoyed this game 10 times more than the last game I bought for the full retail 59.99 (which was Lego Marvel on PS4). It is so refreshing to just have a game to play in, have a silly time with, and just see what you can get away with doing. The developers obviously had a blast making this game and it really shows; every little aspect has a sort of juvenile humor about it that just feels human, instead of cookie cutter, corporately censored forced dialogue and story that AAA titles have fallen into.Yes it's buggy, yes it's glitchy, yes it's pretty atrocious in the graphical fidelity department.. but dear god it is the most fun thing I've played since discovering the GECK for Fallout :DGive this game a chance, you'll love it!

												Being a goat is a lot like being a person. Only a person that doesn't have to take responsibility for its actions, and walks on four legs, and has a furry body,  and can breathe indefinitely underwater, and can survive long jumps off of building, and can move objects several times thier weight with their tongue, and can survive multiple full speed car collisions, and is a goat.

												Goat Simulator's purpose is to entertain the player by any means. This meant removing ony crash bugs because the bugs made people chuckle, allowing the player to break the game, making advanced physics calculations such as turning the goat's neck into spaghetti, and the list goes on. Its sole purpose is to be worth its $10 by making the player♥♥♥♥♥♥himself/herself in laughter. From going down a waterslide in ragdoll, to going to space, to latching onto a hillbilly's car with your tongue and clotheslining innocent bystanders, to blowing up a gas station. The entertainment is endless, and the game gives you enough activities to do. Also, you can become a demon goat, get a baseball launcher, and get a jetpack(from what I've discovered so far).In case you didn't read any of this, you can be a goat and make your neck spaghetti. So 8/10.			"

With this infinite softball spawner strapped to my back, I went on a softball rampage, blowing up cars and pelting innocent bystanders into space. During this time I wound up back at the hanging rock above the protester. A stray softball happened to hit the hanging rock, and it promptly smashed into the protester's face.

												Well. For the first couple of hours of this game. It's a lot better than I initially expected.So far I've:-Sacrificed humans to the satanic goat lord, therefore become a flying devil goat that can suck in people with giant demon balls.-Put a beacon on a crop circle, and then get launched into space, floating around for eternity.-Climbed the magnificant goat tower, of the whole 2 stories. Walking into the top hatch I'd figured I'd be teleported into a gigantic castle, which to my suprise contained several goats bowing down to me as I passed. Once I stepped up onto my throne, I was teleported back into the normal world, which I could make it rain goats at will.-Played flappy goat on a TV, >the pain tho-Saw a nice happy party going on. Saw a boulder. Rolled the boulder down onto the party completely ruining it.-Found the 'Goat Henge' and played dominos.10/10 Amazing game. Completely reccommend it. "

But you could play it for hours and nothing really happens except stuff scattered around the place. This has quests, but they're useless. You just do them and that’s it, nothing else. If it had proper quests and maybe even a story line, I would give this a thumbs up, but unfortunately this game is an awful game. It is entertaining for a few moments and then fizzles out.0/10			"

												There are a lot of silly simulator games out there, and this is one of them. Some of the silly ones were good, even Surgeon Simulator was good, because it was silly and funny, but it was also actually slightly difficult, and was actaully a game. This game is not really that difficult, but it does have some good and bad traits to it. You can play as an animal, which is awesome! There are a lot of hard achievements to get (as well as some very easy ones), and it's a stupid simulator game.You can play as an animal in this game, which I love. It's so hard to find games in which you can play as an animal, and that is the reason I bought this game in the first place, and in the terms of playing as an animal it really fufills it's goal. Not only can you play as a goat, but you can also play as a dinosaur, a penguin, a giraffe and a whale. As whatever you play, you can make noises and act as an animal destroying things.The achievements can be quite difficult or quite easy, the early achievements are obviously very easy, but as in any game, they get harder. Checking the achievement stats, you can see that a lot of people haven't gotten quite a few easy achievements, which makes it clear the people who play this game don't play it for the achievements. The big problem with the achievements are that you cannot get all of them unless you buy the other DLC for this game, such as the 'GoatZ' one, or the 'Payday 2' one. When there was just one DLC it was fine, but now they have released a lot more stupid DLC that has made it harder and harder to get more of the achievements. Having all the achievements to collect makes it more and more fun to replay the game and try and get the achievements.This is obviously a stupid simulator game, but you don't always need to play it as one. No matter what the game, you are always the one who chooses to play the game a certain way, no one is forcing you to play this game in a stupid way, and headbutt things, and go all ragdoll everywhere. You are playing the game like that, and there's nothing wrong with playing the game like that, as it is a sandbox game. But there's also nothing wrong with trying to get all the achievements, it's just another way to play. But despite all that, it is a stupid simulator game, and that also means it has  a lot of spontanious references to mainstream things, like Minecraft, The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, and deadmau5. These references are at first slightly funny, as it's a reference that you know and it's in a game. But at the same time it's about as funny as Saints Row 3 or 4, it's the type of funny that is splewn across the later Saints Rows games, it's not as funny as it would have been if it was a more serious game, but with the references still in there. Having a more serious game with small funny things works more than a funny game with funny things.In the end, I can't recommend this game, as this game only draws in people who just want to experience something spontanious, and not by people who want achievements (because of the low stats) and most likely not by people who like playing animals in games (as there isn't as much of a demand for those games). If you want to play a simulator game for the silliness of the game, you could play Surgeon Simulator, as it is a much more fun game, a game with references and still a lot more difficult to play than Goat Simulator. Although this game can be quite fun to play multiplayer, so unless you want to play an animal, collect achievements or play multiplayer, then you should not buy this game, as it gets old quickley.

												Do you want to succeed in life but procrastination keeps getting in your way? Buy Lag Simulator! From the developer Coffee Stain Studios comes the wonderful game Lag Simulator! This piece of brilliance is sure to make all of your goals in life to come to fruition. Many people suffer from a lack of will or horrible procrastination and so cannot get themselves to do anything with their lives but to stay at home and game, hiding behind the safe veil of their screen. And that is where Lag Simulator comes in to save the day! This game will create such an immense lag on your pc or laptop that you can’t do anything at all but stare at your screen! Yes, that’s right: only staring at your screen! And that’s when you’re still at the menu! I’ve played this game for 75 minutes and all of that time was spent waiting for the game to actually start! How lag! Truly a wonderful piece of art! Needless to say, I’ve never had more fun playing a game. However, staring blankly at my unmoving screen gave me a certain feeling.. A feeling of productivity.  Odd, I know!  But during those 75 minutes of Lag Simulator I got inspired..  Scary, yes.  Inspired to do something. And since my screen wasn’t working (nor anything else since Lag Simulator lags the whole system!) I decided to do something with my life! So passionately (Yes, passion! ) I began reading once again. I now know how to better massage people with oils and special techniques and all that. All of this thanks to Lag Simulator! I, for one, recommend buying Lag Simulator if you really want to succeed in life! For anyone not yet convinced to buy this superb game, take a look at what the developer said about it on their site: “Lag Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game. It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.” Apparently Lag Simulator has goats too. Who knew?			"

I knew the map within 10 minutes, and started to see what i could do around it. Got kinda repetitive, so I decided to achievement-♥♥♥♥♥ the game, as they're easy.Would recommend if you have looked forward to this game/have more than $10 to spendWould also recommend waiting on a sale, its not that time consuming for a $10 game.

												Goat Simulator is one big joke. But a hilarious one, even if it's for an hour. Play as a glitchy, buggy goat and headbutt and run into everyone and everything you see, all the while trying to create the biggest combo you can. The game itself is also very buggy and glitchy so don't expect anything to happen your way. It's random. It's hilarious. The graphics look surprisingly good and there's a good amount of activity and variety available in the map, but you'll probably get bored within a few hours. But, you should give it a try anyway.[Rating: 72/100]			"

												I was thoroughly disappointed by the game. I'd seen it being played and had waited a while to purchase it. The gameplay is repetitive and boring. Whilst it is famous for its 'deliberate' glitches which make the game fun, I encounted issues such as falling under the map and the game not responding on the home screen, which quite clearly are not features. There are other glitches, such as the head/neck one and the glitchy lift in Put-In Hotel which I think may have been intentionally left in there, possibly for enjoyment, but maybe also because it takes a lot of effort to remove.I wish I could say I liked this game but I became bored of it very quickly.

												This game is not as fun as everyone makes it sound.Initially i thought this is a small little sandbox you can turn on and enjoy with friends for an hour when you have time to kill. It is not even that.I found no fun in aimlessly running around, bugging out rag dolls and exploding stuff for no reason at all. Bugs presented as fun feature in this game are found in almost every game - accompanied by an actual fun gameplay experience.Also I experienced strong motion sickness within an hour. I don't know if this was due to the severe performance issues - the game seems to not detect the powerful of my 2 video cards - or due to some other stuff going on... i did not enjoy this game at all.

If you enjoy destroying things, running around, yet don't enjoy seeing actual damage to something alive, this is the game for You. It's mostly based around gaining highscores, achievements and upgrades. The maps are litterally made to explore, so you will have fun if you like that sorta stuff.You won't like this game if:You don't tolerate ""crappy"" gamesYou expect serious gameplayYou don't have humor9/10			"

												This is neither a game, nor a simulation. You have no objective as the player, so it cannot be considered a game. I shouldn't have to explain why this isn't any kind of simulation. It's a sandbox, a very featureless, buggy sandbox. After 15 minutes of dicking around, you'll have experienced everything it has to offer, and there's no absolutely no reason to keep going after that.I'd argue this shouldn't cost more than a couple of bucks, but it definitely isn't worth $10. Heed the developers' own warning: ""Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.""Don't waste your money.

												Goat simulator. In my opinion this in not a good game, you play it once or twice and then you just stop playing. You stop playing because it is simply unplayable and you can do pretty much everything in this game in half and hour. If you look down the reviews people genrally only have 15-0 hours of game play. That is not much for a game they apparently really enjoy. People only leave reviews saying its good as it has a funny/weird aspect, but I can tell you that this is a waste of money.			"

												Being a goat, I can tell you that it's hard to get an accurate representation of yourself in any form of media. Finally we have a proper portrait of what it's like to be one of my own kind! It's a flawless representation and I applaud the makers for doing this. My only complaint is that we do not have a king-goat. We are a proud democracy and have not followed a dictatorship for at least 320 some odd years. Other than that, perfect!All hail our lord and savior the blood goat!			"

												A masterfully done metphor that contemplates our place in the universe.  Goats.  Our world pays so little homage to this creature, but this game does such a perfect job as to underline the importance of it in our modern world.  This game does an amazing job at answering important questions pertaining to life, the universe, and everything.The game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece.  Out of the plethora of games in the genre, this is, by far, the best goat simulation game I've ever played.  The realism in it is absolutely stunning, from the revolutionary next-gen graphics to the pinpointed level of realism achieved.  Goat Simulator is a must-play for any gamer, as well as anyone else, human or goat.			"

												FINALLY! After years of planning, hoping, and consideration of possible repercussions, a team of elite game developers have stepped up to the age old challenge of answering one of life's oldest questions; What is it like to be a goat? Wonder no more, my friends, for we stand upon the precipice of a new era. An era where man must no longer toil in the filth, averting his eyes from the heavens, but may now cast his gaze upwards towards the powers he may not yet understand and say ""I defy you, universe! The time has come where my brothers and I may toss asunder our instruments of ignorant game making and firmly grab hold of the wispy understanding of our own lives that has for so long eluded our desperate grabs! I need not accept my own reality, for through the virtues of human understanding and knowledge, your secrets have been pried open for the whole world to see and learn from! I shall no longer recite oaths of humility toward your once omnipotent presence, for the blessed day has come where the shackles of oppression fall from my tired wrists, and I may reach toward the heavens and pluck from the tree of enlightenment the luscious fruit of power that we were told was poison! Our drowned world is inversed, and life is revealed to us, as mankind is no longer unable to feel what may have slipped between our fingers in the first sad centuries of our lives! We are not vulnerable to your malevolent wrath, oh malicious gods! For we, are leigon, we are undertanding, we are power, we are all, we are Goats!""			"

												SINCE THE DAWN OF THE INTERNETS. Mankind has sought a way in which to simulate the life of a goat. They said it couldn't be done! But, after years of science fiction movies about goat simulator video games we have finally reached the apex of civilization: goat simluator 2014. Eons from now when mankind is long extinct and archeaologists from an alien species are excavating our ruins to piece together what kind of culture we had it is my belief that Goat Simulator 2014 will be the key artifact that redeems our species and convinces them to take DNA from mosquitoes frozen in tree sap in order to clone humans and let us live in their intergalactic zoo forever. Oh theres also a jetpack....			"

												I would just like to say, before I begin, that yes, I think this is the greatest game of all time. There is no other game in the entire universe, from now until the end of time that will compare to the greatness that is this game.You may say to yourself ""My my, this is a big claim you're making. Exactly what is it about this game that makes it so great?"". Well, let me tell you a story.Back when I was 11 years old, I was at school (bear in mind it was a rural area too, so there was lots of fields and farm animals around). I was in class, staring out the window, distracting myself from the boring lessons I had to endure. Sometimes, I would stare out into the fields and sky, contemplating what it would feel like to be out there, totally free to run around as a goat. I often pretended I was a goat at home, when I was alone in my beadroom, running around in circles destroying all of my toys, video games and things in my closet. This felt like it was representing the urge to release myself from the house I was living in and roam around in nature with all the other animals.For about 10 years since then, I was told to suppress my urge to become a goat. My parents didn't want to continuously purchase new toys and games for me to play with (which in hindsight was fair enough too, considering they would break every time I acted like a goat), and during that time, I felt alone. No one was around to understand how I felt. The urge to run around completely naked as a goat, breaking everything, was all but a distant memory, a shadow of my former self that I regretted to have. For a time, I nearly forgot about doing it at all.That was until this game came along.I played it, and played and played it. It changed by life. All the old feelings and urges came flooding back to me as soon as I started licking cars as they drive by. The wrecking of people's houses reminding me of those times as a kid when I would do the same thing in my bedroom. It felt like the developers truly understood how I feel, after all these years searching for someone who had the same hopes and dreams as me.As a result of playing this game, I have now started organizing meetups at night for likeminded people, and we run on all fours throughout the night, around the fields near my old school amongst other goats. Luckily we can get away with making goat noises when we're surrounded by them. No one seems to notice, thankfully. I hope, at one point, we can run through our nearest city as goats at some point, even if it's in goat costumes.And that is why I think this is the greatest game of all time. If anyone at Coffee Stain Studios reads this, I am personally thanking you for becoming an inspiration for me to create the new 'Goaty' fandom.Sincerely,Bob			"

												We all waited patiently. We knew the day would come. Even from the beginning when we blew our NES cartridges or played at the video arcade, we knew one day a game would be released that would change our perception of the world forever.But there was one problem. There were no words in the english language complex enough to describe what we saw in our visions. We could not communicate with each other about the details. The world waited in darkness. Finally the day has come and we can say the words we were always looking for.Goat. Simulator.			"

												Goat Simulator is the latest in hircine emulation technology by developer Coffee Stain Studios, who you may remember as the developers of the not-so-goatish Sanctum games. The game is, as far as I can tell, the premium representation of farm life, in terms of goats, and shows the perfect flow of the life-cycle of the goat itself; doing stunts off of explosive cars is just an example of such things you can experience in this third-person open-world goat-em-up.All jokes aside, Goat Simulator is a collaborative effort by the guys at Coffee Stain which takes pride in it's stupendous outrageousness, your goat can get a jetpack and fly around the packed, albeit small, map that it calls it's home, or would you rather drop peasant goats from the sky as the queen of all that is goaty? Want to imbue the powers of the Goat Devil himself into a singularity of goat *I mean ""out""* of this world proportions? You can do that. Or just interested in floppin' it up with the new-fangled ""ragdoll-key""? Why not?!  When it comes to it, Goat Simulator is a buggy mess, and it embraces that- it's advertised as a ""feature"". However, while Goat Simulator's joke is very funny (or terrible, depending on your kind of humour) it can quickly go stale, after playing for about an hour, the lack ofthings to do has been getting to me, there are modifiers you can use, but there are very limited amounts of them. Goat Sim relies on experimentation but after a while there really isn't much to experiment with.  It's hard to review a game like Goat Simulator, while it's a glitch-filled, ugly, and very small world, it uses that to it's advantage, the devs would say ""It's buggy but who cares because it's meant too be like that?"" and honestly I don't know whether to applaud or condemn Coffee Stain for that. At it's best Goat Simulator is a hilarious monstrosity but at it's worst it descends into monotony. I believe that the Steam Workshop will keep this game alive, however it requires a motive for modding in the first place, and at the price it's at, I don't think it'll get much of that. Goat Simulator is £6.99 here in the UK or around $9.99 USD or €8.99 EUR. Personally, I'd wait until it came down in price if you're interested in some goat based action. I can't really reccomend this game but I can't push you away from it. If you're good with slapstick generally silly humour then this might be for you, if not then keep a watch for major price drops. I'd reccomend waiting anyway. Hazwold out.			"

												I knew my life would be over the second I purchased this game. My sweaty palms have been clenched to my desk, while I was sitting on the edge, waiting for this game to finally become playable. As the download bar rose in front of me, the golden sun rose at dawn, and the birds were flying backwards, I knew something wasn't right. All I could hear were goats ""baaah""-ing in the distance, when suddenly, the play button finally appeared on the title.As I reached my mouse over, everything went black. All I could remember was pressing my left index finger down on the button. I then slowly opened my eyes, to find millions of goat lives flashing before them. I finally understood the way of the goat, my time had come. I realized 60 seconds had passed, but this was enough to know my objective. While it was still fuzzy, I stepped into a large field. In the distance were some humans, enjoying themselves. Cars litered the streets, and houses sat on the horizon. As I entered this town, It seemed like these humans didn't want anything to do with me. All I could do was eat grass and watch the day go past me. I then slowly stumbled into one of their BBQ parties, the humans seemed like they were having a nice time ""socializing"". It seemed that they didn't care much for me neither, in this moment it felt like no one cared about me, and there was no reason I was in this world, doing my goatly duties without any other goat-pals. One of the humans then flipped the patty on the grill, and it was then when he mumbled...""These goat-burgers seem a little burnt""My pupils reduced to nothing. I figured out why I was the only one, and was greatly disturbed. There was now nothing I could do but run away, so these humans couldn't find me for my deliciousness. Running into the forest, I stopped to notice that, this wasn't what I was here to do, there had to be a reason, and I was just running from it. I had to do this for the greater good.With my rage-induced horns held high, I rammed into the grill, and the humans went flying. It was then where I found out my tongue was stuck to said grill, this was now my weapon. Crashing through a house, swinging the grill into every posession they owned, I got a start on my revenge before getting stuck in a wall.My tongue slapped into a nearby car, and in an act of rebellion, the driver took off without any warning. Flipping around without any control, I let go and flew into the sky, and landed by a nearby gas station. Flying into it at high speeds, this was how it ended for my journey. In a burst of light, I was set off sky high.The world then looked so small from thousands of feet in the sky. I knew there was no stopping, and I was fine with that. Going out of the skybox and past the inter-dimensional plain, I hoped that what I had done had inspired goats from now on. Everything then went white.It's a neat game.			"

												We all waited patiently. We knew the day would come. Even from the beginning when we blew our NES cartridges or played at the video arcade, we knew one day a game would be released that would change our perception of the world forever.But there was one problem. There were no words in the english language complex enough to describe what we saw in our visions. We could not communicate with each other about the details. The world waited in darkness. Finally the day has come and we can say the words we were always looking for.Goat. Simulator.			"

Our collective creativity has allowed us to solve many seemingly impossible challenges. Today, we have just reached another milestone in human history. This is it.

												Pac-Man Championship Edition seemed like the perfect Xbox Live Arcade game when it arrived back in 2007 -- but an even better version is now available on PlayStation Network. Somehow, gaming's oldest mascot is delivering one of the most exciting games of the year. More mazes, more modes, more ghosts...lots more ghosts, actually. This ""deluxe"" version takes everything that made Championship Edition great and adds a bunch of cool new stuff. It's like taking a great white shark and adding laser beam eyes and saw blades that shoot out of its mouth.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX is all about gunning for a high score. Games are timed, so you need to eat as many pellets, fruits, and ghosts as possible before the clock stops. You don't die as often as you did in the original Pac-Man, you earn plenty of extra lives, and you have many bombs at your disposal to get out of tight spots. (Yes, Pac-Man can now trigger bombs that send all of the ghosts back to their hideout.) Without much fear of death, you can focus on the one thing that matters: representing on the online score boards.Pac-Man now has many more ghosts to contend with. Like, a hundred more. You'll see the spirits sleeping around a maze, and as Pac-Man whizzes by they'll wake up and give chase. Hold off on eating a Power Pellet long enough and you may find dozens of ghosts trailing behind you in a long conga line. Finally grabbing that Power Pellet and devouring a hundred ghosts in a row is one of the most satisfying things I've done in a game this year. This is also a key technique in getting those high scores.While the first Championship Edition was super fun, there were only a couple of mazes and modes. DX has nine mazes, most of which are new creations that offer a lot of variety. For example, Spiral has several coils that are easy to get trapped in. Dungeon, on the other hand, has long, cramped corridors. Each maze also has many game options such as Score Attack, Time Trials, and Ghost Combos (see how many ghosts you can eat with one Power Pellet). When you first dive into Championship Edition DX, only the standard Championship II course is unlocked, but each round you play usually unlocks a new maze or mode.Like I said, it's all about the high score, and Championship Edition DX provides many friendly ways to see how you rank against the competition. You can comb through the leaderboards for extensive data on all the many maps and modes, but there are other really nice touches: your current ranking is displayed right on the title screen, the Course Select screen, and again within the menu for each maze.Pac-Man Championship Edition DX also looks and sounds great. You can select from a variety of maze skins and character designs for each game, running from the 3D Pac-Mania characters to pixilated retro sprites. The lively electronic soundtrack builds in intensity as the game timer ticks down and always gets me leaning forward in my chair.THE VERDICTPac-Man Championship Edition DX boasts simple, addictive gameplay that will have you competing for high scores on the score boards for months. Everything that made the first game a hit is still here, accompanied by a bunch of new mazes, modes, and ghosts -- all for $10. It's hard to imagine a more perfect PlayStation Network game. This is a master class in game design: you will understand it instantly, enjoy it instantly, and want to play again and again.10/10 like skyrim but with guns			"

												The most beautifully immersive game I've ever played. Running around licking cars is everybody's dream. And this game lets you live it. This game is life itself personified and moreso. I had no life until I had a Goat Simulator.This game is truly limitless, if not for its authentic goat noises to the ability to run off the map without spazzing out everywhere and teleporting to a random place with a glitched neck. It has a little bit that caters for everyone.My favourite part of Goat Simulator is I can finally achieve my lifelong goal of becoming a goat. I can feel the light on my furry nostrils as my devil horns rule over my sacrifices. I can become the tall goat of the Savannah, never before discovered or named quite so fondly. Although it is not quite the same as putting my hooves on daily and experiencing first hand my goatish complexion, Goat Simulator establishes the balance between reality and goats. Indicating there truly is a goat within us all. For the human race is born goats.                                     This game has made me a better person.                                                                  Amen.			"

												This game is boring. At first it seems funny but after about 1-2 hours of playing you start to realise why glitches are actually funny. Glitches are funny in game because they aren't meant to happen and often result in some funny things happen. We also get to take the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the devs because they haven't noticed the glitches, but this game is meant to be glitchy and at first that is funny and OMG so random but then it gets boring because glitches aren't a game. I don't recommend this game at all, it is not worth the money because it's boring and isn't a game.			"

												This game is unique. Truly, truly unique. In an age where most video games do take themselves seriously (as is understandable in a world that still somehow downplays video gaming as a valid, competitive piece of the entertainment industry as a whole), it is absolutely refreshing to see a game like this come out that's not trying to be a masterpiece, or tell an in-depth story. Goat Simulator is ridiculous, colorful, somewhat pointless, hilarious, and a ton of fun.I had an argument with my best friend, who said he thought it was ridiculous this game was getting so much attention because the Meta-Critic score left much to be desired. I think he missed the whole point.Goat Simulator has glitches. The world exists for no reason other than for you to rampage through it as a goat. The people who walk through this world will literally run into things such as street posts and fall down in a pile of tangled limbs. I saw one guy walk up over a concrete guardrail and into a river, where he proceeded to float down the river without trying to swim to safety. The physics don't make sense in this game and are barely realistic. The game has a ton of technical flaws. You get stuck. You can fall through floors and fly through walls. And yes, the frame rate drops frequently, particularly when I try to jetpack my goat into space, just as I burst through the earth's atmosphere.THAT'S the point. That throughout all of its flaws, it is still a hilarious ride through a ridiculous premise of a game that is not meant to win any awards, it is meant to be FUN. It is meant to be hilarious. It is meant to be there for you when you're having a bad day and just want to launch a game for a few minutes to feel better. To be honest, half of the time glitches happen, they're hilarious. They add to the game and are not a detriment at all. Even the frame rate drops don't bother me, because...I mean, come on. My goat is going to space with a freaking jetpack. The frame rate drop feels NECESSARY with something that epic. I recommend this game to pretty much everyone. It's cheap as it is, and on sale it's a steal. At the very least, you'll have a lot of fun and laughs for a few hours in a game so ridiculous it's a miracle it exists. This is a game that exists solely for fun and entertainment value, and that is what it succeeds at.			"

												Goat Simulator is a lot of fun, it's filled with amazing bugs and glitches, it's got a lot of secrets to it to discover and it's the first single-player game I've had the most fun with for a while. It's a bit pricey, however, what I don't think people understand is that there are going to be a few free updates with more content and there is a workshop and a full SDK for the game. The workshop is slowly getting content and a new update is going to be in May including a new map. I've completed every challenge and gained every achievement, yet I find myself coming back to the game even after 18 hours. If you are willing to give a bit of cash to support some independent developers and to have fun and laugh at some incredible glitches I'd say buy this game.			"

As Usual she replied ""Shut the hell up kid, I'm watching my damn tv set"" As usual i would go and cry until I had to eat again.Then I decided to ask my Dad. ""Dad can I be a goat for the rest of my life."" His response was ""What the ♥♥♥♥ are you gay or something."" Then my Dad told me to go outside. While I was outside I decided to ask my neighbors. ""Can I be a goat for the rest of my life?"" ""Who the hell are you get the hell out of my property.""Then I thought i should go to a docter to see if he could he could change me into a goat. He said ""No kid that is litterally ♥♥♥♥ing impossible you damn queer!""Then I logged into my steam account later that night. The in a bright framed there shined goat game. I purchased it. I downloaded it. II had no idea that man made something as amazing as this. This was heaven that in the form of a game. This was no ordinary game. You could get ran over a car and get right back up with no ♥♥♥♥♥ given. You can jump on a trampoline as a goat. if you like you can make goats rain out of the sky. This game is so amazing that it has an achievement if you crash youe computer. I told my parents about it and they said ""Go away you damn queer or else we will sell you to a Camodian family and you will work for 40 cents a day.""I left and I wasn't even sad i just played Goat simulator for 637 hours and gained 586 pounds and died at the age of thirteen. Beautiful isn't it.                                                                10/10			"

My future is bright now, this game changed my life for the better. If you're ever struggling with your life give this game a go. 15/10 would control a goat and change my life again.			"

												Quite possibly the best goat based game ever made.Essentially you're a goat. And you do goat things. And then those goat things explode. If you have any interest at all in goat related activities, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. It's like GTA, but you're a goat.			"

												When I first laid eyes on this game, it was April 1st 2014 and I was highly amused by Steam's version of an April Fool's joke; because, a goat simulator, come on! However, it did puzzle me how much work they had put into the delightful screencaps, and it almost seemed real and ready to buy. (Needless to say; I was even more puzzled when the game remained in the store even after April 1st.)Then, some months later, a friend recommended it to me, and when it was on sale, I thought; okay, why not?Now I should mention that I am a busy student and have my library filled with unfinished games because I have barely time to play. And at the time when I bought Goat Simulator, I hadn't played anything for more than an hour in a while.I bought Goat Simulator, with the MMO Simulator already implemented, and whoa, in the first week I managed to play 26 hours in total; easily surpassing my general playtime over the past months. I was hooked. And I remain hooked. 10/10			"

												Great character development and beautiful storyline. The ending made me cry. 10/10Seriously though. This game has a lot of fun achievements. You will need all the dlc (besides the soundtrack) to get them all.I will now do the rest of this review entirely from an achievement hunter perspective.Considering there are over 100 achievements, I can't say that this is the best game for achievement hunters looking to add to their perfect game count, but even the hardest of achievements in this game are obtainable within at most an hour of play (with the hardest being the trophy collecting tasks).Each DLC comes with a good amount of achievements, most of which involve interacting with something located somewhere in the map (each DLC has a new map), and one where you need to collect all the hidden trophies (there are steam guides for everything, so it's not too hard).So like I said before; if you are hoping to get every achievement in this game, be prepared to spend a fair bit of time. Otherwise, going after these achievements are a lot of fun, and even if you aren't an achievement collector, the achievements can give you something extra to do.If achievement collectors even exist on Steam, I hope this review helped them.

												Goat simulator is a fun idea, and it has alot of wacky moments and it is a joy to play.  It honestly is.But I cannot give it a positive review at the time of writing.  There are only developer maps (One I cannot even play.)  It kinda boils down to... bugs are a feature.   I don't mind bugs in games, some of them have bugs that turned out for the better, some games have bugs that break the game.  Some of Goat simulators bugs are kinda neat, but the game almost bricked my computer, causing blue screens, lockups, and a brown screen upon rebooting once.The game is fun, it is, but the fun is thin, it runs out, once you do...everything thats pretty much it, just rense repeate, I think the developers are banking on fan made content to carry the lifespan on, but no offence to people who create great content, I prefer what the devloper makes, so maybe the fan made stuff saves it.  I wouldn't know.I would wait on buying the game, if what is shown on youtube looks appealing just watch that a few more times.  I strongly urdge the developers to review their policy on bugs with the game, I do not have a top end PC, and that may be why this game almost bricked it.  I'll write a more positive review when some of the issues have been addressed, bugs have been fixed and probably when it is out of early access.I really want to like this game.			"

Don't expect to clock 100 hours and this become your new addiction, the map is small. But the the game is fun. Once/if the modding community comes I'm sure this will be the next laughing simulator.If you'd like to see some gameplay there is some below.

												""Piece of art""Goat Simulator is the new and promising game by Swedish game developer Coffee Stain Studios.In the game you get to play as a goat and all you have to do is to wreck things and hurt people.Many people think that Goat Simulator is ""funny"" or even ""stupid"", but what they don't understand is the fact, that the game is criticism of our modern society in asophisticated way: The people behind Coffee Stain Studios want to say that a goat simply could not fit into our society, it would just destroy everything without knowingwhat it does. You get the feeling that you cannot be a normal human being. You are being reminded by this depressing fact in every possible way:  - You see robots - When you want to attend a family dinner, you cannot do anything but destroy it. - When playing the popular video game ""Flappy Bird"" you, and only you, are a goat in the game.Other people in the city will not react to your cries for help, they will only run away from you. You are searching for attention but everyone will ignore you.Another sad fact is that you will encounter one scene in the game where people actually pay attention to you, but they just want to see you fight against other goats.The atmosphere of the game is very depressing. Seeing how the town is slowly being destroyed by protesters, that don't want ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped food"" nearly made me shed a tear.This criticism makes the game something speacial, I would even say it will get the ""GO(A)TY 2014"" award.Coffee Stain studios have done a really good job by implementing a workshop feature, that allows players to create other maps, goats and other things.=> I highly recommend this game because of its' unique experience. However it is quite expensive and not really worth 10€.5€ would be more matching with the cost-benefit ratio.			"

												As an avid Goat enthusiast/fetishist, I bought 'Goat ""Simulator""' during the recent steam sale, and I must reluctantly say, it was not worth the purchase. The game prides itself on being a 'Simulator', yet the realistic experience of playing a goat that was advertised is not delivered upon. For example- 1) Goat's tounges are NOT adhesive, and they do not have the strength to pull along cars or people, as this game suggests. 2) There is no Goat devil or angel - goats do not have a religion. 3) The goat in this game can survive falls from extreme heights, explosions, being hit by cars, and being sucked into fans. Goats in real life are NOT immortal. 4) Goats cannot perform front OR backflips, nor can they 'manual' on their front paws. 5) In reality, Goats are NOT able to ride on Bikes or skateboards. Goats have a poor sense of balance, due to a natural inner-ear problem evident in their species  - this is perhaps the one thing this game portrays accurately. Overall, this game was extremely dissapointing. I expected another game for me to spend hours in, simulating my dream of being a goat and mating with female goats, or milking myself, yet in the end I found this game lacking of everything that I expected.

												This game sucks.Yes yes, it's an april fools joke, I understand, I have some humour. But ten euros for this disaster is just overpriced and it's one of the top selling games already for a week just because youtubers play it.So, there are multiple factors that make this game an abomination.The bugs, this game is one of the buggiest games I've ever seen, when you start to play it it is so funny HAHA THAT GOAT DOES FUNNY HAHA, but after a half hour all the jokes in this game become very repetitive and plain annoying. You can't walk without tripping over anything and then you have to wait until your goat stands up again, and three seconds later he's on the ground again. Also, when you're trying to do something it happens sometimes that you fly all over to the other side of the map because of a random programmed bug. And other situations are that you're trying to get on a roof for a trophy for the achievements, but you keep falling through the roof and then you have to climb up all your way back. And don't get me started on the bug that some 3d models like cars or trampolines don't appear until you're close to them.The controls, the controls are so annoying, your goat goes most of the time for no reason in ""muscles off"" mode, and sometimes it takes time to undo that, guess why, because the controls aren't responding. The game is set for a QWERTY keyboard, mine is AZERTY, in almost all games you can edit the controls, and in all of those they stay saved, but of course, in this one, the controls don't save, you have to redo the controls all the time again and again and it gets annoying quick, and because that you get stuck a lot, you have to reset the game again and again and that obviously correlates with resetting the controls. There are also some control bugs, like when you start a new game the controls are not responding, etc.... And the worst thing is the acceleration of your goat. Since you fall so much, you have to accelerate again, and it goes from very slow to fast that you can't control your goat, and when you stop your goat while running he might fall over.The achievements, most are very easy to get, it's fun getting a lot of achievements quick and seeing funny things, but then there are the unfair ones. And I mean unfair, not challenging. For example, the achievements of Payday 2 are insanely hard, but fair, the achievements of Angry Video Game Nerd adventures are hard, it's a hard platformer, but still, fair. But the achievements are this just♥♥♥♥♥♥you off so much. Let's take the all trophies one, some trophies are very easy to get, but others are on impossible locations with such big bugs that they're impossible to get that it takes you so many tries. Like the one under the fan, there is a spinning fan on a hard to reach location, and behind that fan theres a trophy, and the fan spins fast, and if you touch it you get rocketed to the other side of the map, that means you have to walk so much and fall over a lot again, reach that hard to reach location, and then try again. And since the controls are so annoying it's almost impossible to go over the fan, it took me so long and it was so annoying, but that's only one of the multiple hard to reach and unfair trophies. The jump on the five trampolines in one jump trophy is so annoying too because you can't see the trampolines until you are close to them because of bugs. So you have to search all the map for trampolines and perfectly remember their placement and then jump the very buggy jump controls which takes ages. And then there's the worst... the horrible... flappy goat achievement.... It's like flappy bird, but on a very small screen, full of bugs and much faster. So you go in a building and there's a tv there and on it flappy goat. The screen of that tv is small so you have to look very good, and it goes fast and you flap high. Also, the worst about it is the horrible collision, your goat touches the pipes even when it's not touching it, you really have to be far away from the pipes to not touch them, this took me a hour of pure frustration to do.Well, that's about it, this game is overrated, a disaster, overpriced and annoying. 1/10 just because it made me laugh in the first half hour			"

												I have never been able to get past the loading screen, and apparently, this is a major problem for a lot of people.  I tried it again after the update, and now it simply crashes to desktop rather than freezing my whole computer and requiring a full reboot, so I guess that's a slight improvement.Because of these issues, I cannot recommend this game at this time.  I actually have no interest in playing anymore, as the whole thing is a joke that I've already heard the punchline to.  Seriously, save your money and go watch PewDiePie or Tobuscus play the game.

												Have you ever wanted to be a goat? Well I sure have. Today you can finally become a goat that is still recovering from getting in a car crash and breaking his legs. Well if that doesn't convince you, have you ever just wanted to run into a man at full speed and kill him automatically without getting arrested? Well now you can. Even if there were cops in this game you could use the mechanics of licking him and just fly him across the map and he'll never be seen again. Have you ever wanted to drive a harvester and kill innocent civilians? Well too bad. Oh, I forgot to mention, as of right now I am holding onto a man hang gliding with just my tongue. This has to be the best goat simulator out there. It isn't like any other, and I highly recommend it. 10/10 Bahhhhs.			"

												Have you always dreamed of being a goat? Well luckily for you some people do as well, hence, Goat Simulator. You play as a goat with a messed up neck and oversized tongue with the tendency to hump the floor rather than walk. You headbutt strangers into Michael Bay sized explosions because sure... why not? This game does have some minor ""quests"" if you can call it that, rather it seems like it tosses you some cookies to still be interested in the cookie jar. There isn't much to ""do"" if you're a I NEED OBJECTIVES kind of a game player, but if you're looking to troll around town with a horribly flawed physics engine and stick your tongue in very rude places then perhaps this game is for you. If not for the goat, buy it for the music. It makes the atmosphere that much derpier. Overall, the price is a bit steep for a goat sand box, but it isn't something I regret buying. Also if you dream of being a back flipping gymnist, then this simulator is for you. Girls got nothing on my goat flippin' skillz.  6/10			"

												Do you one day dream of growing up to be a professional goat? Well guess what, this game's the closest thing to the real deal you'll possibly find. You like grazing in the field? It's got that. You like running and headbutting into things? It's got that. You like licking and attacking people for no real reasion? It's got that. You like performing satanic rituals that turn you into a demon? It's got that. It's literally got everything a normal goat does. So before you go out and spend all that money on college to take Goating 101, be sure to try this out and see if its a life you want to lead.I really shouldn't write game reviews when I haven't slept. BUT I DONT CARE BUY GOAT BE GOAT LIVE THINK SHOOT GOAT.			"

												It's not just a simulation, it's a journey. Through this groundbreaking simulation we are transformed; able to repercieve and refine our own lives through the experience of partaking of the essence of another lifeform. Some may see only a goat, but we become more. We surpass the mundane. We become the goat elivened with dreams, fantasies, and aspirations. Through the goat we become free to live out any and all freedoms this sumulated life grants us, free from disarming and constricting social bonds. As I partake of the simulation, I find myself overcome by the enlightenment granted by multiple and sometimes conflicting perceptions of the self. I am reminded that consciousness as we know it is infused throughout reality. I am redeemed. I am reborn. A solid 7/10.			"

This game is esentially a physics-based Three Stooges game, only this time Moe, Larry, and Curly are gone and in their place is a humble goat that defies the laws of physics and gets into absurdist slapstick mayhem complete with oddball gags and easter eggs. It's dumb, crazy fun for those that want a good set of laughs.			"

												Weird game but quite funny. Many different phrases and easter egg from different games are in this game which I find really cool. This is a game were is meant to be bugged and have tons of ragdols, its pretty much 50% of the achivements are to do something with ragdol.  Worth the tiny cost and recommand everyone who likes ragdol and weird goats.			"

												I've been a big fan of simulators for a long time now, and I look especially for depth, immersion and authenticity in all aspects of a good simulator game. ArmA has always been one for me that has brought me deep into the world of something I enjoy and given me a true to life, realistic perspective of what it would be like to live a day in those shoes. Goat Simulator however, takes it to a whole new level.I've watched goats for a long time now, studied them profusely and would in fact go as far as to call myself a Connoisseur of Goats, and what really impressed me about Goat Simulator is the sheer depth that it has achieved in making a goats daily life something that we can all enjoy. Whether you are simply exploring or as goats are prone to do, dragging a car up a water slide with your sticky tongue, you really feel like you're in the shoes of the Goat, or in its hooves should I say, and when you look at the physical properties the game accurately portrays of a goat in free fall or its impacting upon the ground, you really get a feel for just how passionately the R&D team on Goat Simulator studied the physical attributes of goats and their effects on the world for the games portrayle.I must say that as both an officionado of Goats and Simulators I couldn't ask for much more, however I am looking forward to a version that is compatible with Occulus Rift, so that I may see the world through a goats eyes. A tip to anybody who is seeking a more authentic, goatier expiriences, play the game with cups over your hands to simulate goat hooves, you will not be dissapointed, I promise you.10/10 - Redefines Perfection			"

												This simulator is unquestionably the pinnacle of video gaming; in fact, it is the pinnacle of all human endeavor. That's right, folks - architecture, literature, drama, science - nothing compares, and nothing else ever will compare (not even the mythical Candy Crush Super Deluxe Xtreme Edition). It's all down hill from here.At least we can be comforted by the existence of Goat Simulator as we begin the long, slow, inexorable slide into the void. When the heat death of the universe comes, the last sentient creatures in the galaxy will know that all of this, all of everything that has ever taken place, was worth it... because of Goat Simulator.

												Goat Simulator is a joke of a game. It’s small, deliberately unpolished and buggy, and its design is simple. So it’s a good thing it’s a really funny joke, full of great physics-powered slapstick humor, and unexpected surprises in every corner of its seemingly peaceful small-town map. There’s not much actual gameplay here beyond breaking things for points, but shooting for a high score is probably the least entertaining thing about Goat Simulator. It’s mostly about exploring the fun house and discovering the hilarious surprises at your own pace.			"

												For years my goat enthusiast friends and I have been searching for a game that fully takes advantage of the many paradigms that goats have to offer. Coffee Stain Studios had a chance to capture a niche market looking for the ultimate in goat simulation software. I had considered investing thousands in computer peripherals to enhance my simulation experience, including buying a 640 by 480 monitor to better simulate goat vision, goat food trays for my desk as well as a conversion of my gaming room into a barn.  There was a palpable desire for this game amongst us in the goat enthusiast community for many years, and this game promised to deliver with realistic physics and visuals. For the past few months since I have heard about this game, I have begun eating nothing but dried grass and water and sat next to my calendar and my computer waiting for the game to be released. This game consumed me that the only thing I could say was “I love goats” in a vacant voice. I have not moved for 3 weeks now, my room smells horrible. My wife and kids have left me, but I’m not really sure because they didn’t matter now that Goat Simulator was on the horizon. Soon I could be the goat. Soon I would be ready to receive. My body most definitely was ready.However, much to my dismay, Coffee Stain Studios merely mocked us in the goat enthusiast community. This game was an utter disappointment. I want my goat simulators designed by goat experts, who have had years in the field. Clearly these people have never met goats. I have been a connoisseur in goats for over 30 years, and this game is nothing more than contrived misinformation by governments worldwide against the goat cause. There seems to be a vendetta against goats in this society, these ‘goatists’ such as the ones at Coffee Stain Studios have  insulted the entire goat race and they should apologise. I demand a refund. This goat persecution should not be tolerated. I have reached out to many news agencies to hear my plight, and I am hoping Anita Sarkeesian will address this issue in the next goatist frequency video.Pros:-	The New Lick Feature is much appreciated – it brought many things to the gameplay I did not expect possible with our current technology. I was able to realistically simulate goat.Cons:-	I was hoping for a 24/7 live updated, real time world with weather affects and PhysX GoatTM, with live feed satellite rendering of the earth’s surface so I could realistically move my goats between all the world’s major goat farming areas and enter my goat into beauty contests.-	The sacrifice area and devil goat were unnecessary. However, if you enjoyed scarier elements of games like Farming Simulator and Chemical Spillage Simulator, this would be right up your alley9/10 would play again. "

												I feel i need to say this first and foremost.the people who say this is a stupid game, are jaded and have forgotten what a ""GAME"" is.this is exactly just that, something you can pick up play for a while and then go off about your business.sure it is dumb and a little repetative but sometimes thats just what you need to fill half an hour.Not to mention all the add ons that make this game even better than before.all the little things you can do and get points for is great. not to mention it has had me and others who were watching laughing our arses off. all bar ONE thing in this game i like and that one thing is god damned flappy goat. frikken diabolical game lol.but i recommend it if you remember that a game doesnt have to be serious or story driven and is there just to be played and laughed at either by yourself or with friends watching/playing.imo i have paid 10 bucks for a lot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ games.

												   So, you are looking at buying Goat Simulator as I was only a few days ago. You are probably also thinking, ""What has my life come down to that I am actually going to purchase and spend time on a game that lets me become a goat?"" This is my story.   I awoke in a field. My body feeling odd and warm as if I had just fallen asleep under the sun for a few hours. Before moving, I realized that I was much closer to the ground than I had been prior to this sleep. I looked around, and suddenly realized that my vision was thrown off a bit, Like I had a wider field of view, as if I were now able to see things like wolves and suchat greater angles of vision. I used this ability to peer at my own body, which I had just realized was covered in nappy gray fur. I got up, realizing that  I am now a goat.   Well ♥♥♥♥.I walked over to the fence that had now filled my entire view, as I am now a goat which is around four feet tall. I tried to climb over it, when suddenly, every part of my body fell limp. I could not move. Slumped halfway over a fence, and I could not move a muscle. Any body who walked by probably thought that I was a ""special goat"".   All of the sudden, a thought popped into my head for a split second. Press Q ♥♥♥♥♥♥....]   And I stood up. I made it over the fence and found myself in a town I had never seen before. It was small, some citizens were walking down the streets, cars bustling down those same ones. I tried getting help, running up to the nearest man who looked to be in his mid 40's.   ""BYAAAHHHHHWWWWWW"" I screamed at him, trying to say help.   ""Oh my god it's going to kill me!"" The man started to run.   I chased after him, ""Byaaaaahhhh.....BBAaaaaaahhhhh....YYUUUEEEAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH""   He just kept running. I had found myself near a gas station and decided to run inside. The shopkeeper was quick to shoe me out, but in the process, I may have destroyed every piece of merchandise in the store. As I ran out, I slpped on the sidewalk and fell back into the state of ""slumped limbs"" or what some mght call ""Ragdoll mode"". My body flew acrosss the ground like marbles of a gameboard and slammed into a Honda civic, causing the car to explode. Yes, explode. This is not where it ends though as the explosion of the car triggered the gas tanks underground to explode as well. Sending my body into a suborbital trajectory. Yes, still alive even after two explosions and running out of air. I was intercepted by an astronaught named Jeb, as I flew, he brought his ship alongside my slow-floating body and brought me aboard.    We landed safely in the ocean and are now awaiting recovery.   -Submitted From KerPhone 510/10 Would Review Again. "

												This simulator is unquestionably the pinnacle of video gaming; in fact, it is the pinnacle of all human endeavor. That's right, folks - architecture, literature, drama, science - nothing compares, and nothing else ever will compare (not even the mythical Candy Crush Super Deluxe Xtreme Edition). It's all down hill from here.At least we can be comforted by the existence of Goat Simulator as we begin the long, slow, inexorable slide into the void. When the heat death of the universe comes, the last sentient creatures in the galaxy will know that all of this, all of everything that has ever taken place, was worth it... because of Goat Simulator.

												""Happiness isn't happiness without a violin playing goat.""     - Julia RobertsHere we 'Goat' again with another simulator hitting the Steam front page. But wait, Goat Simulator is not like any other simulator that has preceded it. It's actually not that 'BAAAAD'. I mean, this is how goats are actually like in real life. Everyone knows that goats and trampolines together creates mass genocide, it's just common sense. I'll be honest, this isn't really the type of amazing piece of work you might expect from 'Van goat.' Nonetheless, Goat Simulator is one of those games where all its imperfections are what make it priceless. You might be stroking your 'goatee' in wonder, or perhaps really not at all, but rest assured that bugs and game-breaking hilarity are intentional mechanisms of the game's entertainment philosophy. It's hard to really write a review with so many goat puns 'butting' in, so I think you'll just have to take my word on the fact that this game is amazing.So don't be such a 'kid' and just get this game. You really won't regret the 'charge' on your card, despite any 'ramifications' created from the time you will waste playing this game. Or dont, whatever floats your 'Goat.'			"

There is a LOT of things to do in this game. I mean, you get to sacrifice humans what gets better than that?!  You get to headbutt people, do frontflips, fall off of buildings and survive, lick things and carry whatever you licked with you, lots of hidden objectives to do, turn into different types of goat, and etc etc.In conclusion, most hilarious game I've ever played. I have no idea how many drugs they were on before they created it, but it is on my top ten game list. If you havn't heard or played this game I'm very disapointed in you. It is definatly worth the money and is a must play game.BUY IT AND PLAY IT!!!!!			"

												This is a wild ride. Full of Easter eggs and in-jokes. A sandbox game with a goat and all types of trouble a goat can into. Not   a traditional game, but lots of fun to be had, even if it is just one big joke.- The play time is not idling, my son really likes the game that much.			"

												I pledge allegiance to the goat Of the United States of GoatmericaAnd to the Baaa-public for which it stands One nation under goats, IndivisibleWith liberty and justice for goats Okay, that's enough jokes involving goats and 'Murica. This game is esentially a physics-based Three Stooges game, only this time Moe, Larry, and Curly are gone and in their place is a humble goat that defies the laws of physics and gets into absurdist slapstick mayhem complete with oddball gags and easter eggs. It's dumb, crazy fun for those that want a good set of laughs.			"

												When I was young I always wanted to be a goat. I begged my parents to turn me into a goat. Even though that will never happen I know I can still pretend to be a goat with this game. Although this game is not the true experience of being a goat nor is it helpful in learning how mate with goats, it does give me freedom to learn the advance movments of a goats neck. 10/10			"

Within the first 19 years of  my actual life I have accomplished obesity and an 8hr masturbation marathon. I think that gives you all the information you need.			"

												Well let me just say that this is best ten dollars i have ever spent behind of course only the muppets movie ticket i paid for yesterday but besides the point i dont care if this game is glitchy thats what makes it fun. This is broken and thats awesome also, i wish there was a bigger map but i bet in updates to come or workshop maps there will be. So if you cant decide to buy a membership to ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or buy goat simulator buy both. 11/10. I dont like many games but this one is already at the top of my list with Saints Row 2 my favorite game of all time and that is saying alot.			"

There are also many mini games throughout the map such as: Flappy goat and time trials. The graphics in this game arent to shabby but there better then others.

After all, i was told by my doctor i would never be able to goat due to a rare condition called goatosis but look at me now, no creature on earth can stop me. I had also heard several negative coments about the game for being to glitchy and slow. But thhese are just coming from the non-goaters (otherwise known as the sheep). They have no taste in good games and are afraid to experience the sensations of being a goat. Don't be a sheep, get this game.			"

												Jetpacked a demon goat through some guys window, broke all his stuff and got glitched in a wall. 10/10.On a serious note if you are buying this looking for a serious game or expecting it to be smooth and amazing look somewhere else instead of getting mad because you didnt do your research. This game will get most of its content from user generated content on the steam workshop, so don't complain if you run out of things to do because it just means you are to lazy to download somebodys hilarious map or goat model. It is a funny, spastic and creative game, worth the ten dollars if you ask me because eventually there will be massive amounts of user generated DLC to keep this game going for a while. seriously 8/10 would buy again.

												PCs are for sad geeks who have no life. Game consoles are for those who want to entertain themselves. I once tried using a PC - it was an absolute nightmare! (those who create these various versions don't exactly make them for the novice; they wrongly assume EVERYONE is a Geek) And using it was WORSE!!! Besides, I've ALWAYS used XBox, and it's too late to teach this old dog new tricks. And when PCs become as easy to use as XBox, games are as easy to load into PC as it is for XBox, and there's Halo 2 ported to PC (or better still, XBox games are compatible with PC), THEN I'll use it And You PC-ers DARE to accuse Bill Gates of being the 'Antichrist'?! At least he makes his game consoles EASY to buy & use!!! So, until then, I say: GET THEE BEHIND ME, PC-SATAN!!!			"

												An honest review here...The game itself is riddled with bugs, funny moments, crazy physics and cool easter eggs. At first glance and reading PC Mag's review of this game, I was going in with the attitude of '20 minutes of fun for ten bucks'. I could never have been more wrong. After doing achievments and easter egg hunting for about an hour and a half, I checked out the steam workshop and started playing GOAT PINBALL. I downloaded some custom models for my goat and turned into shrek, my hero. I felt a warm glow behind my desk.I turned, a green ogre greeted me with a toothy grin.""YA LIKE ME GAME, LADDEH?"" He bellowed with glee. I lay down and knew what was coming. He stuffed himself inside of my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it hurt. But I did it for shrek. He let out one mighty roar as he filled my butt with onion-flavoured ogre love. Then I realised it was the next week and I decided to stop playing Goat Simulator.10/10 Shrek is Love, Shrek is life.

												In the first few moments of being a goat I thought I was a simple creature not capable of destruction or harm. But I soon came to realize that I was quite the opposite....I was next to a cliff and at the bottom of the cliff was a lake, so following my newly discovered  destructive goat instincts I grabbed a woman by her ankle with my tongue and then ran full speed towards the cliff. Upon my descent I slowed down time and saw an entirely new world.... I could see the terror on the womans face as we fell to the water below... And it brought me great joy.That was only the beginning of my reign of terror, and what followed has still only scratched the surface of my potential.11.5/10			"

Goat sim is the game for you!  Plus you play as a goat which is pretty great.Goofiness of the game aside, there isn't much more to it than playing with physics that are half broken.  It's hilarious and a ton of fun but only if you really like playing with physics.  Don't buy this expecting something in depth because there's seriously not much more than playing with physics as a goat.			"

												do not get mac users! even if you think your mac can handle this it can not if you want to play a game with 1fps with a mac fine  grapics are terrible!Update:im still leaveing the review as negitive because it draws attention to this so others can lean form this more. This works better on windows (witch i have a surface 3).I think part of the problem was that the mac that i had was from 2006 and nearing the end of its life (i knowthis because it died 6 months later (Rest In Peporoni my dinosour mac) so i think if you mac is yonger or as old as 3 or 4 years old you should be fine. so i would rate this a sideways thumb but there is no such thing.So the lesson here is if you computer or gpu, cpu, or whatever else is more than  8 years old (now its 2016 so 10 years old) dont try and use games with alot of physics on it.

												The concept of Goat Simulator is funny.  However the few levels it has are very small and it gets boring EXTREMELY fast.  This is caused by the only real goal in the game, to ""get more points"" or attempt to do a different stunt.  After hitting people or doing stuff to cars there is no consequences or reactions, they just reset and continue what they were doing.  The glitches are funny, but they are too common so it gets old fast.  You may be able to have more fun playing it with a friend, but I still don't think it will be long before you both move on to a different game.  What would make the game better is if you start destroying stuff, and then the people ""around you"" (not everyone) start running after you.  A consequence.  The more you people you disturb, the more people run after you.  And if you are caught, you are sent to animal control or something where the level ends.  Which can end up in true chaos and panic as you try to get away and keep your points or try to still increase them.  But instead, the people just get up, the items just reset and everything continues on its robotic paths. No chaos, no consequence, no end, no truly fun goal.If a friend bought it already, play their copy, but I don't recommend buying it yourself.If you bought this hoping for a lot of fun or constant laughs, but disappointed like I was, I'm truly sorry.  Perhaps the developer will read this and add in the feature that I mentioned, ""without additional glitches"".			"

												Goat Simulator is incredibly boring, despite what twitch streamers/youtubers fooled you into thinking of it as simple entertainment. To put it simply, it's a poorly featured game overhyped by the internet. Without DLC, there's a very limited assortment of things that you can actually do. What this game expects you to do is pay a few bucks for a part of the game that makes it playable, and then immediately asks you to go get their DLC to play more than just a measly few maps. This shouldn't be the case for a game that already has so little to do other than charge into people and stand on top of vehicles. Even when I got this for a discount price, I still found it ultimately wasteful of both time and money. The only way this game is ever ""fun"" is when you see someone else killing off their wallet for Twitch viewers. Otherwise, it isn't a fun game, and you should not be fooled by the popularity of the concept since it gets boring really quick. (Hell, if you want to be specific, only one person in my whole friends list played this piece of crap for more than five hours.)I'm never buying into the simulator fad again.			"

												I've looked through the positive reviews and a lot of them seem to be jokes, so I figured I would finally try my hand at a real one. This game is incredibly fun. I picked it up pretty early on, when you had to buy a key from the dev. It's silly as hell, and that's the main part of it. You're a goat. You destroy things. There are glitches which are mostly humorous. The game is completely absurd and doesn't try to be anything else.The game will give you various tasks to do such as getting a certain combo, getting hit by a car, earning X number of points, etc. Therein lies the ""plot"" so to speak. As of now there are two maps, but there are ""exits"" to go from one map to the next which, given the current environment, suggests there will be a third map at some point. Both maps are fairly large. There is plenty to find/ explore on each map, which should keep you busy for a while.There are a few drawbacks to the game, however. Occasionally the glitches can be bad enough to ruin the session. Entirely possible it's my set up, but worth mentioning all the same. The other drawback is that replay value is somewhat limited. If you spend a good two hours or so with a map, chances are you'll have seen/ completed most of what it has to offer. This was something that initially diminished my interest when I first bought the game, but that interest was completely renewed with the update that brought the second map. It's very much one of those games that you can get really into for short periods of time every now and again.Overall, the game is absolutely worth your time, even at full price. If you enjoy silly humor, destroying things, and the like, you will love this game. Despite the arguably limited replay value, it is a ton of fun. Each map has its own set of tasks (the list is identical between the two, I believe) and there are lots of secrets to find. The achievements add another level of fun as well, as some of them are fairly specific tasks. The only way you would not enjoy this game is if you have no sense of humor. You won't necessarily get hours and hours of fun/ playtime, but you'll get your money's worth ten times over.Edited for the steam award badge. Yay!			"

												Nonsensical, chaotic, and a little bit of hitting home with extreme sports video games that score you for stunts.Coffee Stain Studios, with their own creative sense of humor involving goats, provides wealthy amounts of content that hit many pop culture video gaming references. In addition, it's deliberate use of bugs, lags, and various amounts of chaos, dementia, and destruction, make this free-roaming game feel like playing in the sandbox for the first time as a child without actually doing so as an adult and embarassing yourself in public (unless you're a babysitter, nanny, or parent playing with said child).

Since the map is so small, you eventually know everything about. All its secrets, easter eggs, and other things. After a while, I didn't really enjoy blowing cars up and wrecking houses, i don't know, it's just really boring now.I don't reccomend this game to you if you don't want to spend 10$ on a game you'll stop playing in a day or two.

												Sorry Coffee Stain, but I'm gonna have to say no to this game. Why? Well, granted, it's fun for maybe the first twenty minutes or so, but it gets inexplicably boring after a while. We've all seen ragdolling everywhere before, so watching a goat spazz out isn't exactly hilarious. I mean, if you want ragdolling, Garry's Mod is the place for that. Also, the map. For a map that's supposed to house a goat that could possibly get hit by a car and fly away, it's pretty tiny. Like, we're talking tiny tiny. Also, if you follow what the game tells you to do, after maybe an hour or so you'll end up with some serious lag. It's like, fresh at the start and dead at the end. There's no way you can reach that high point goal unless you're ♥♥♥♥in' a with combos. However, this game isn't all that bad. I mean, the Easter Eggs made me snort a little. Also, there's a Workshop mode, so you can play other maps and play as things other than a goat, such as the Heavy Weapons Guy.So, this game. 4/10.   Take the disclaimer seriously.Unless you can afford to throw around 10 bucks like it's♥♥♥♥♥♥ Then by all means, buy this game.			"

												The thing about goat simulator is that its one of those games that is fun for a little bit and then you never play it again, you find the secrets and thats about it. It isn't really a game its just a simple sandbox that rather than having unlimited fun, it just kind of expires and you're left with nothing. I'd give cheers to the devs for getting new content out there, but the score system isn't enough to make it a game. No one bought goat simulator because they wanted to play it and get a high score, they bought it because they have nothing better to do and on account that the whole game is just a meme. Rather than making the whole game a joke being told over and over again, the developers should try to take an approach similar to Octodad, where the game had a STORY and there was a point of you being there, unlike Goat Simulator which doesn't really have an engaging goal or any story at all. Goat simulator's concept is alright, and it could work for sure, but the execution of it makes it bland and gives it a finite amount of entertainment. If the game was given a factor that made it feel a bit more like a game rather than just a limited sandbox then I might've given the game a positive rating. I realize I'm going to get hate for this practical look at this game based on my experience, and because when people read reviews they want everyone to have the exact same opinion. In conclusion, I rate Goat Simulator a 3/10, I think it just really needs a better pull factor than the score system and the ""memes"".			"

												Ok so lets get straight to the point.The game has an objective - A score based game - This is good.The game involves workshop - GoodThe game involves unlocks - good.The one thing that is boring about this game is the fact that if you play this, you know what is going to happen, If you have played this before you are going to know that the goats head with glitch out and people will fall over and explosions happen.Fair enough - You play the game for the first time and its funny.Boring - You play the game for the 3rd time and you know what will happen - Boring.I hope people know what i am getting at. Its really obvious what will happen when you launch the game. Glitches on purpose. People falling over. Its like Coffee Stain Studios are forcing laughs on people.The only good thing that im starting to like is the fact that there is a workshop there so people can get invloved to make the game BETTER. It just gets boring knowing that you have the same maps and physics.			"

												This is the single worst game I have ever played. The developers of this game should be ashamed that they force ANYBODY to pay any money at all for this all around awful game. I purchased this game at full price, becaus I thought that at the very least, it would be funny for a couple days, but no. The novelty of this game wears off after about 2 minutes of gameplay, at which time you slowly begin to realize how much this game has bent you over and screwed you. I was unfortunate enough to purchase this game before steam refunds were a thing, so I feel that writing it a not-so-positive review was the least I could do for this actual heap of garbage. Do NOT buy this game, not even when it's on sale, not even to make a funny joke. I wish that I could have back the time of my life that I spent playing this game so that I could kill myself knowing that such an abomination of humanity is allowed to exist and steal innocent childrens money. 0/10			"

												Here you are once more, on the Goat Simulator page on Steam. No... no, don't leave yet. Stay awhile -- relax a bit, have some tea. Chamomile perhaps? It was always a favorite of mine, back in the old days in the Romanian countryside, where I grew to manhood alongside Scruffles, my pet bear. Scruffles was a gentle bear for the most part, but he was a deeply troubled soul. I could not forsee what terrible things he would do to that family. Sometimes I think back on it and wonder what more I could have done for him; wonder if there were any signs that I missed, or if I had ever been unkind to him in any way...Oh, but I forget myself again. I apologize. Let me stoke the fire one moment.... there... now where were we? Oh yes, the game. Yes, here you are once more, perhaps after a few days, or maybe even months. You've heard whispers about it, you've seen the videos, and perhaps you even watched a friend play it. You saw it listed once, you clicked on it -- you debated on whether or not you should dip into the money you were saving for your wifes anniversary dinner. Or perhaps you scoffed, your nose held high, unwilling to part with your hard earned cash in exchange for this utter rubbish. Whatever the case, you're back here, aren't you?Is it a Steam sale that now draws your attention? Perhaps it's always been on your list of games to buy? Or has the morbid curiosity in you reached that point of no return? Are you unable to restrain yourself from clicking that purchase button? Are you even okay?Don't answer that last question; you ARE okay. You will be okay. Everything from now on will always be.... okay. You see it wasn't just you that brought you back here for what could possibly be the fifth time... it was Goat. You don't know Goat, except that you do. Goat has always been with you, whether you're aware of it or not. The lingering presence, the angel on your shoulder, the devil in your gut -- all of it was Goat. Goat has been with you in your dreams. Goat was with you during your SAT's. Goat was there when you stood beside the pastor and watched your beloved walk down the isle.Goat was there. Goat was always there.And here you are again, reading this review, wondering whether or not you should purchase Goat Simulator; wondering if it will fullfill you in ways only few other games have. Or maybe you just wonder why you're back here again, after so many other visits, trying to figure out just what it is that compells you to return. Well there are no more questions you need to ask yourself now is there? There are no more questions because suddenly the way is clear.Goat is calling you home. From the moment you were born, Goat has been there with you, watching over you, waiting until you were worthy of the glory that lies beyond the purchase button. Every time you nearly touched it, it was Goat that slapped your hand away.... because you were not yet ready for the greatness. But Goat is calling you, and you can hear him now. Goat is waiting for you on the other side. The great beyond lies waiting for you -- it is a place of light, healing, transcendance... and whales. Lots, and lots of whales.But above all the great beyond is that one place you've always been walking towards though you never really knew it. It's  Eden. It's Valhalla. It's the Stars. It's Goat Simulator.Come home to the great beyond. Come home to Goat.			"

												Before buying the game, i researched online the specs for Goat Simulator - my laptop is fairly low end - to check if my computer could run it. System Requirements Lab told me that i could easily run the game with the recommended specifications, so i bought it. However, when I played the game it was very laggy and i could not run it at all without putting every setting to low and turning off lighting effects and shaders - and even then the frame rate doesn't rise above 15.This hasn't just happened to me, as i have found multiple forums on people talking about this issue. Don't buy this game unless you have a high end computer.			"

												Worth every penny. (Well I bought it when it was on sale so.. if I bought it for $9.99 it wouldn't exactly be worth every penny.)ANYWAYS, I got this game over the weekend. In 10 hours I managed to complete 45/47 achievements of this game. This game is so beautiful. I'm going to faint. This made goats one of my favorite animals. 9.5/10Pros:-Beautiful world-Beautiful physics-Beautiful goat-SO many ""easter eggs!"" -Endless hillarious montage of fun-Touch a person and they flob as if they didn't have a spine-Combos are epic-All the different types of goats are epic-Workshops=endless fun-WHEE! FIREWORKS!-So many bugs. And yes, this is in the Pros list.-Really fun-to-do achievements.-100 more reasons this game is beautfully fit for any occasion.Cons:-You need a real good computer for this. Open world. Even at lowest settings you will get pretty low fps. How do I know this you ask? Well... um.. I just know? Eheh.-Some not-so-fun bugs, such as ones that will crash the game (but you get the achievement lolz) or ones where you get stuck under the floor so you have to respawn, but that's not a big matter because it's not like you can travel 100km in one map.-Kind of pointless game. BUT the achievements, which I worked on, kind of gives a point to this game.Overall one of the h4wtest games I've played. "

												Goat Simulator is a game where you explore and try to achieve goals. The game is very humorous. You can blow up can and gas stations and even lick and kill people! you pick things up by licking them. There are 3 hidden sanctum items in this gamr 1 from sanctum one from sanctum 2 and one from sanctum 3. In a house there is a game called flappy goat which is flappy bird. The first timeI played this I loved it I reccomend this for everybody, It is one of the best steam games i've played!			"

												This game is hilarious and very fun...........for the first 30 minutes. It's glitchy fun at it's best, but the area is rather small and the objectives you have are very short and easy to complete. But the one thing that will keep you coming back to this game is the wacky stuff found on the workshop, and honestly, I think that's what saves it. That's why I give Goat Simulator a 7/10			"

												As a joke game this probably deserves a joke review, but it's actually a far more thoughtful and clever parody than the youtube fodder it presents as. The levels are basically just playgrounds filled with in-jokes and references for you to discover. Ranging from the obvious to those which take your brain a while to process and then you catch it and feel clever. If you're looking for a deeper purpose the achievements are a good way to discover what else there is in the levels, but there's no beginning and end point particularly so don't buy this if you're wanting a plot or progression system. Run around, find the jokes, hunt the achievements and have a good laugh. That's it, but sometimes that's actually all you need in a game. Side note: I nominated this for the 'best use of a farm animal' award, hence the review.			"

Something lit up in me and I got this game. I frolic through the world let my goat did. With the help of this game, I got my wife and kids back, my job, and my life. I showed my friends this game and they screamed like 5 year old girls. I was so happy and my kids wanted a goat now. We now have 10 goats and are happy.

			GOAT SIMULATOR - First rule of Goat Fight Club...don't talk about B-A-A-A-A-A-H!!! More Goat Simulator game play. Let me know if you want to see some more.		

 ).That being said, if you enjoy ridiculous physics based games you will likely enjoy this one.  You play as a goat (among other things) and raise hell in a small town full of people straight out of a late 80's RUN D.M.C. video.  I was in tears laughing at how much of an @$$hole this goat was....then I realized, I'M THE @$$HOLE!  No real objective, but lots of hidden goodies to keep you playing for a little while.So in short, if being an @$$hole in real life isnt enough for you and you have always wanted to live vicariously through a goat...this game is for you!  Or if you just want to have a good laugh occasionally I recommend it.			"

												I can finally say since the latest update which was today I can now play the game instead of the always constant sudden crash on the launch, my thoughts of the game hmm... where shall I start, a free range goat with tons of time on his hands unbounded by society, freedom in his sights, no goat rules of any kind whatsoever o_o the world is your oyster tiny pigeon now fly fly like the wind & never look back for the world today is a better world than yesterday.

												You get to be a goat. You run around and collect stuff. You destory stuff. You get to play flappy goat (not to be confused with flappy bird). You get to take part in satanic rituals. There are quests. Some music that really sets the mood. 10/10 would recommend.			"

												My existence as a human had reached it's peak and life has become boring, I have longed for the day when I could become goat, this has brought me as close as possible until science catches up to my needs. I can run free and be the goat I always desired to be. So please if you feel as though the goat life has chosen you do yourself the favor of buying this simulator, live goat, be goat, buy goat.That is all I have to say for I must goat, my people need me.

												Worth every penny. (Well I bought it when it was on sale so.. if I bought it for $9.99 it wouldn't exactly be worth every penny.)ANYWAYS, I got this game over the weekend. In 10 hours I managed to complete 45/47 achievements of this game. This game is so beautiful. I'm going to faint. This made goats one of my favorite animals. 9.5/10Pros:-Beautiful world-Beautiful physics-Beautiful goat-SO many ""easter eggs!"" -Endless hillarious montage of fun-Touch a person and they flob as if they didn't have a spine-Combos are epic-All the different types of goats are epic-Workshops=endless fun-WHEE! FIREWORKS!-So many bugs. And yes, this is in the Pros list.-Really fun-to-do achievements.-100 more reasons this game is beautfully fit for any occasion.Cons:-You need a real good computer for this. Open world. Even at lowest settings you will get pretty low fps. How do I know this you ask? Well... um.. I just know? Eheh.-Some not-so-fun bugs, such as ones that will crash the game (but you get the achievement lolz) or ones where you get stuck under the floor so you have to respawn, but that's not a big matter because it's not like you can travel 100km in one map.-Kind of pointless game. BUT the achievements, which I worked on, kind of gives a point to this game.Overall one of the h4wtest games I've played. "

If you're looking for a goofy game to keep you busy for a few hours, this game was made for you. NOTE: This game is a parody. So, it is buggy (for comedic purposes).			"

Iso miinus on se että pelin mukana tullut tavara loppuu pian. Voit olla Strutsi ja kirahvi juu, mutta se ei ole niin iso juttu.Onneksi on Workshop, josta voi ladata loputtomasti lisää tavaraa peliisi. ♥♥♥♥♥ ei siis lopu.Ihan hauska peli on, antaa hupia pariksi tunniksi, jonka jälkeen alkaa tylsistyttää. Ei ole kympin arvoinen mutta suosittelen silti. Jos saat alesta vitosella niin osta, ja naura pari tuntia.8/10 Peli, would play again.P.S. Älä voita painimatsia voimakasta pässiä vastaan Strutsilla. Seurauksena on mutatoitunut superpässi jonka kaula on viismetrinen. lennät ulos maailmasta aika pian. :D			"

												Tässä on pelin idea: Olet pässi. Pusket♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥rikki. Bugaat ja lennät ulos maailmasta. Loppu.Voi kuullostaa tylsältä, mutta sitä tämä ei ole :D Tämä peli on aivan järjettömän hauska. Iso miinus on se että pelin mukana tullut tavara loppuu pian. Voit olla Strutsi ja kirahvi juu, mutta se ei ole niin iso juttu.Onneksi on Workshop, josta voi ladata loputtomasti lisää tavaraa peliisi. ♥♥♥♥♥ ei siis lopu.Ihan hauska peli on, antaa hupia pariksi tunniksi, jonka jälkeen alkaa tylsistyttää. Ei ole kympin arvoinen mutta suosittelen silti. Jos saat alesta vitosella niin osta, ja naura pari tuntia.8/10 Peli, would play again.P.S. Älä voita painimatsia voimakasta pässiä vastaan Strutsilla. Seurauksena on mutatoitunut superpässi jonka kaula on viismetrinen. lennät ulos maailmasta aika pian. :D			"

												As a joke game this probably deserves a joke review, but it's actually a far more thoughtful and clever parody than the youtube fodder it presents as. The levels are basically just playgrounds filled with in-jokes and references for you to discover. Ranging from the obvious to those which take your brain a while to process and then you catch it and feel clever. If you're looking for a deeper purpose the achievements are a good way to discover what else there is in the levels, but there's no beginning and end point particularly so don't buy this if you're wanting a plot or progression system. Run around, find the jokes, hunt the achievements and have a good laugh. That's it, but sometimes that's actually all you need in a game. Side note: I nominated this for the 'best use of a farm animal' award, hence the review.			"

You can blow up can and gas stations and even lick and kill people! you pick things up by licking them. There are 3 hidden sanctum items in this gamr 1 from sanctum one from sanctum 2 and one from sanctum 3. In a house there is a game called flappy goat which is flappy bird.

												There´s a lot of joke and meme games on Steam, and most of them won´t last you for more than 1 hour. Goat Simulator is the exception, and the DLCs are even more crazy and enjoyable.If you ever wish to play as a goat that manage to be abducted by aliens, become the bringer of death, turn into bread, assamble a group of animal farms to get your payday, blow up the earth, ride boats to islands full of mushrooms, die and become a zombie to bring the apocalypse on earth, go to space and ♥♥♥♥ it up, discover all about goats like the dicovery channel would never dream of, and lick, lick, lick till you bleed everything that you see, then this is the game for you. If you never wanted to do any of that stuff, I have to seriously ask you, what kind of person are you, you weirdo?			"

												Well, you are a goat. You are nearly invincible... and a goat. You can become more than a goat, but you have the heart of a goat. This game is fantastic. I have never felt so in touch with my inner goat than with playing this game.  There are many, many bugs and glitches that might frustrate some, but if you are choosing to play this game, then you can choose to live with them. It is difficult to figure out everything you can do (I stumbled on how to flip until I READ THE LOADING SCREEN) but you can figure it out in time. There is no save per se, but you keep all your achievements so that helps.  I MUST recommend this game. It vents your frustation, quells your urge to kill your fellow man, reduces your desire to create bombs.. it fulfills your every desire, if that desire is to be an invincible goat. I love it. 10/10  no ifs ends or baa's about it.			"

												Why did I pick this one up?Well, the first (and main) reason is that I happen to like goats. They're cool. Goats are one of my favourite animals; they're certainly my favourite herbivorous mammal and just so happen to be my sign as well (Capricorn) so I've always considered them sort of my lucky animal-- in the same way as 34 is my lucky number. But that's neither here nor there.Aaaanyhow, about the actual game:It's a sandbox-style indie game, starring you as a very unrealistic goat. It should be fairly obvious by now that in no way is this an actual ""goat simulator"" that attempts to make you take on a realistic caprine role. It's very wacky and lighthearted and frivolous, and it's meant to be. And it even has a crazy story about a goat in purgatory, believe it or not. Check it out.As others have stated, Goat Simulator is fun in short bursts. I like sandbox games like this; such games give the player the freedom to run amok and do whatever your twisted little heart desires. The main goal is basically to cause as much destruction and mayhem as possible, and in the most creative ways possible. Try to cook up some wicked combos and you'll score high.If you dig sandboxy stuff, you'll probably enjoy this. If you like wrecking stuff and ramming innocent (and not-so-innocent) members of the homo sapiens species with your trusty set of horns, you'll definitely have a lot of fun with this game as well. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously, and I find it rather charming for what it is.			"

												Why did I pick this one up?Well, the first (and main) reason is that I happen to like goats. They're cool. Goats are one of my favourite animals; they're certainly my favourite herbivorous mammal and just so happen to be my sign as well (Capricorn) so I've always considered them sort of my lucky animal-- in the same way as 34 is my lucky number. But that's neither here nor there.Aaaanyhow, about the actual game:It's a sandbox-style indie game, starring you as a very unrealistic goat. It should be fairly obvious by now that in no way is this an actual ""goat simulator"" that attempts to make you take on a realistic caprine role. It's very wacky and lighthearted and frivolous, and it's meant to be. And it even has a crazy story about a goat in purgatory, believe it or not. Check it out.As others have stated, Goat Simulator is fun in short bursts. I like sandbox games like this; such games give the player the freedom to run amok and do whatever your twisted little heart desires. The main goal is basically to cause as much destruction and mayhem as possible, and in the most creative ways possible. Try to cook up some wicked combos and you'll score high.If you dig sandboxy stuff, you'll probably enjoy this. If you like wrecking stuff and ramming innocent (and not-so-innocent) members of the homo sapiens species with your trusty set of horns, you'll definitely have a lot of fun with this game as well. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously, and I find it rather charming for what it is.			"

												The only reason why I am not recommending this is because it is ten dollars for the ability to stumble around and get hit by cars.  Yes all the easter eggs and the addition of a second map is great but after about an hour it wears off.  I recommend that you spend that money on some of the great games like Gmod, Knights of the old republic, Portal, Minecraft and all the Half life games that are the same price as this. Only get it is it is on sale.			"

												Since the Dawn of Humanity itself, the question has always been present: What is it like to live and breathe as a goat ? THis game finally answers the age-old question. Goat Simultor, succesfully shows you the life through the eyes of a goat ( many different types of goats at that ), its stunning graphics along with extemely realistic in-game physics provides of you for an extremely authentic Goat Experience. THis is without a doubt the game of the decade, a true pioneer in the game world. This game is strongly worth every cent of its underpriced $9.99, I would gladly pay $5000, as such marvels in soceity must be funded. There is little chance a game will ever rival the stunning world of Goatville or Goatcitybay ( which rivals the size of the GTA V map). In summary, a true masterpiece that will be talked amongst forever, a game capable of making its viewers,: cry, laugh and appreciate and undestand the life of the Goat.  "

												As someone that commented months ago on the tech demo that Coffee Stain Studios released for this to turn into a real game, I am very glad to see it actually made an released... This game, as the developers noted, is broken with crazy an silly bugs and extremely goofy in a small, yet very detailed world... Sacrificing humans, being king/queen goat, or being taken into space by a UFO are just some of the hilarious things that you can do in this game...Yes, the game is small as of right now... But even after 7 hours playing I am still finding ways to do crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Plus the community workshop is slowly filling up with content so the fun will never stop with this game! This game was more than worth the $10 for admission... Get this game now and have a blast!			"

												There´s a lot of joke and meme games on Steam, and most of them won´t last you for more than 1 hour. Goat Simulator is the exception, and the DLCs are even more crazy and enjoyable.If you ever wish to play as a goat that manage to be abducted by aliens, become the bringer of death, turn into bread, assamble a group of animal farms to get your payday, blow up the earth, ride boats to islands full of mushrooms, die and become a zombie to bring the apocalypse on earth, go to space and ♥♥♥♥ it up, discover all about goats like the dicovery channel would never dream of, and lick, lick, lick till you bleed everything that you see, then this is the game for you. If you never wanted to do any of that stuff, I have to seriously ask you, what kind of person are you, you weirdo?			"

												This game has more to it than it seems, it is in fact ""greater than itself"". There is a hidden story that is easily missed. This is what happenes to a goat that has been too evil to enter heaven and rejected to come to hell because of a deal Goat has made with the devil. The two tunnels on each side of the map symbolises the gate to heaven and hell. Even how hard you try, you cant go through them. You're rejected. One day Goat wants to be the king of all goats, and the only way to do it is to make a pact with the devil. In exchange with Goat's soul, the devil gave Goat the power of the Goat king. Then the day came to Goat as it does to all other creatures. The day they die. Since Goat sold his soul to the devil, he was meant to go to hell. Goat asked for a last meal, and he wanted the an apple in the tree, The Devil accepted his wish. While the devil climbed in the tree, Goat drew a holy cross on the trunk, rejecting the devil to come down. Goat told Satan that the only way he could get down from there was to give Goat his soul back. Satan had no choice and gave Goat his soul. Since Goat were still dead and now had his soul, he would ask God to come to heaven, but he was not allowed in. For all the sins he had commited he were not allowed to live in paradise. And since Satan do no longer wants him back either, Goat has to live forever in limbo. Buy Goat Simulator. Entertain Goat. Because this is all he has left.			"

												My existence as a human had reached it's peak and life has become boring, I have longed for the day when I could become goat, this has brought me as close as possible until science catches up to my needs. I can run free and be the goat I always desired to be. So please if you feel as though the goat life has chosen you do yourself the favor of buying this simulator, live goat, be goat, buy goat.That is all I have to say for I must goat, my people need me.

												Let me be honest, i thought this game was going to be a joke. Ever since my gerbil's drug addiction, i have been searching for something to rebuild me and this is just it. The story is so deep and meaningful i found myself remembering moments from my childhood and reassessing past actions i have made like my arrest back in 98'. I started up this game and it ran butter smoothe and i could edit the options for optimal graphical settings. Okay enough bragging about my pc, lets get into the game. I was astonished at the transition from the menu to the game. It was as if the game spoke to me while it transformed from just another ""game with a menu"" to a PERFECT game with a menu. The grass moved with grace and the fences were plain brown. The first thing i did was jump over a stick so gracefully, a tear let out of my eye. After breaking the fence and blowing up a gas station i was inspired to go and sign up for an anger management course to stop beating my wife. Before this game it used to be me vs the world however, now the world and i work together to become one. I have simulated my goat life for around 3 or 4 hours but i am immersed. By not being able to die in this game, i have realized suicide is not the answer. If there were one word i would use to describe this game it would be inspirational. It has been so therapeutical being able to lick crowds of people and flying jetpacks at the same time. The community for this game is just astonishing. There is a whopping 15-20 mods on the workshop! thats more than even skyrim has. Some poeple may insult this game but they have obviously not experienced the work of art that IS Goat Simulator. The gameplay is better than fallout and far exceeds my very own expectations. It was so genius making ""lick"" E and ""use"" R. I mean, that is some real thinking right there. I can bring all the loose items near me into a ball AND lick them at the same time!!! i know this seems childish but i just love licking♥♥♥♥♥♥after discovering this game. Oh and the animation for licking is just perfect. Your tounge ACTUALLY BOUNCES!!! i know it sounds crazy but i swear this is real!! Also, the sounds are just what brings this work of art together. As i hear the hooves of the goat hit the ground i listen for the birds in the distance chirping and the hippies arguing to end♥♥♥♥♥♥♥shaped snacks. When i am doing something crazy like blowing up something, it sounds like i am just there. I can sort of feel the air coming from my screen and the flames and smoke look professional. It would be hard to explain but, thats why you're reading this getting your credit card ready to buy this masterpiece. If you do not like goat simulator, it' because you have not witnessed it first hand. When you actually have the mouse in your hand it is like a peaceful high. Your mind focuses on becoming a goat and your body adapts. At school, i find myself trying to ""baaa"" to impress my aqquaintances. Everyone supports my playing of this game and they often take pictures and videos of me performing my goat screams. People are claiming that there are bugs with this game but trust me, THERE ARE NO BUGS. THE GAME IS 150% PERFECT NO LIE. Currently i am sitting down listening to tupac and ""baaaaing"" the lyrics. I am so happy, i even told my parents that i found a love in life. She is this game but i havent told them yet. This game has changed my life so much and i have learned so much. Wether i am licking basketballs and blowing up cars with it or enjoying a peaceful game of flappy goat, i am always happy. This game is picture perfect and needs literally NO patches. If you buy it you will not regret this purchase. Definently my choice for Game Of The Year/Decade/Century/Milenium. If i had to rate this i would give it a 43/10 just because of it's inspiration on MY life and the many others who have played this. I love you all and please buy this game. $10 is a small price to pay for a great lifeley experience and i would definently pay $60 if i had to!!!			"

												Goat Simulator is a simulation game (so to speak) developed by Coffee Stain Studios. The main core of the experience is about controlling a common goat inside an urban area in an effort to achieve ... things.While the game has a score system, in truth your main objective is to discover new and creative way to use the goat you are given. You can headbutt people and objects, lick something and carry it around and so on. Some quests (so to speak) are pretty easy to clear, while others are far more obscure.As far as additional content goes, there are several goat statuettes that can be found around the map and goats models to unlock, each with a different gimmick and/or special power.In the end, the fun you are going to experience with Goat Simulator will be as long as your willingness to stick around trying to do everything that there is to do, which may take a good while			"

												Why did I pick this one up?Well, the first (and main) reason is that I happen to like goats. They're cool. Goats are one of my favourite animals; they're certainly my favourite herbivorous mammal and just so happen to be my sign as well (Capricorn) so I've always considered them sort of my lucky animal-- in the same way as 34 is my lucky number. But that's neither here nor there.Aaaanyhow, about the actual game:It's a sandbox-style indie game, starring you as a very unrealistic goat. It should be fairly obvious by now that in no way is this an actual ""goat simulator"" that attempts to make you take on a realistic caprine role. It's very wacky and lighthearted and frivolous, and it's meant to be. And it even has a crazy story about a goat in purgatory, believe it or not. Check it out.As others have stated, Goat Simulator is fun in short bursts. I like sandbox games like this; such games give the player the freedom to run amok and do whatever your twisted little heart desires. The main goal is basically to cause as much destruction and mayhem as possible, and in the most creative ways possible. Try to cook up some wicked combos and you'll score high.If you dig sandboxy stuff, you'll probably enjoy this. If you like wrecking stuff and ramming innocent (and not-so-innocent) members of the homo sapiens species with your trusty set of horns, you'll definitely have a lot of fun with this game as well. It's not a game that's meant to be taken seriously, and I find it rather charming for what it is.			"

												Goat Simulator is a game that offers you fun times and tons of glitch(but in a good way).You can stroll, complete quest or do some crazy sheet its your choice. There are diffenent maps and each map has its own activities. My favorite one was MMO mode. It was  hillarous and enjoyable. Developers made this mode so realistic that you can think in your first play ''wait a minute is this real?''(i did). There are funny easter eggs and quests. Its not so long but has a diffenent taste. Classic modes cool as well. You can play it for stress relieve with destroying everything. And yeah i definitely recommend this game.			"

												He knew his mission well, but it would not be easy. Gingerly, the brave magician stepped up to the catapult. It was meant for sheep, yet he was a goat. The guard, too preoccupied with his thoughts to note the magician's valiant, yet foolhardy act, noticed all too late.A crack. A rush of air. The caprine hero sailed through the sky, over the walls of Twistram, crashing painfully to the ground behind the church.An uninformed onlooker may have thought him dead. Surely no beast could rise again after its limbs had been twisted so completely. Yet rise he did, determined to complete his mission. Composing himself, he skirted the churchyard, spotting a gathering by the far wall. Sombrely, he joined the mourners, who stood with bowed heads at the graveside.Boom! His fireball sent them soaring in all directions, some crumpling against the walls of the church, while others flew from the clifftop into the sea. His agile tongue quickly flung open the coffin, seizing the fish that lay within. The villagers were returning, but the walls of Twistram were too high. Swallowing the fish, he dove off the cliff. His only hope now was to follow the coast until he reached the home of the elves...A gripping tale of might, magic, majesty, and a gigantic wizard pig! Well that's Goat MMO Simulator anyway... I haven't pulled myself away for long enough to try the other modes yet.			"

												An absolute masterpiece. This is perhaps one of the greatest games to ever grace mankind. Game devs of the future shall look back upon this gem and hope they can create something with even a fraction of its awesomeness. I cannot recommend this game enough. I have never before, and most likely will never again, play a game that can evoke any and every emotion from me within the first fifteen minutes of playing. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll curse, you'll sing with joy. Anything positive I can say about this game will merely be eclipsed by the actual experience if you decide to pick it up. And so I give this game a score I doubt I'll ever give to any other game in my lifetime, the coveted and sought after: 10/10			"

												This game is best suited for a light hearted people that think creative or are easily entertained. This game was overhyped at start. It had a tiny map that could be completed 100% in 3 hours (and in which you could get bored in even less than that because of how limited it was). It was used as a youtube bait by some people. Hell, it was bad for its price tag. All of that, sure.  Now, it has a lot of new content. 2 new maps with a lot of quests to do, new unlockable playable characters, new abilities, tons of secrets and exploring. Is it fun now? Definitely! It's no longer limited to breaking stuff, ragdolling at people and breaking the game with glitches just like with any other sandbox game. For how long it will entertain me? Well, depends on how much content you are planning to unlock and what crazy ways you've come up with to complete the side quests. Most of the in-game jokes are overused memes and pop-culture references, but this game has its moments. Some of the personal expirience: Rode the bike as a t-rex. Rаped a man as a humping elf guy and then climbed the skyscraper by using the thrusting power of my body. Became a joust and slapped the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of people with my spear. Feeling lonely? Have no friends to cheer you up? Goat simulator is a game for you to buy it on sale and have fun with on that gloomy rainy day! Bring a friend, it has local co-oh right...			"

Goat Simulator ReviewAnother one of those goat simulator games.This game is the best goating simulation game of the year. I understand it's hard to get so much success on a big gaming trend like goat simulation but this goat simulator was by far the best. I licked a car into a fence. It exploded. The game mechanics are amazingly complex, this is next generation stuff right here. If you're a fan of hilarious comedy, then go away. This is a game to be taken deadly serious. It's all about the way of life and how to goat properly. Let's face it, we've all tried to goat at one point. Most of us fail, so this simulation game is perfect for those that are currently unable to goat correctly. This game teaches you the full goat etiquette, law and physics. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone over the age of 22 and under the age of 23. I hope you learned something from this review. The game is certainly worthwhile, but if you laugh at it, then you're a sick person! This is a very serious game! Thanks for reading!			"

												This game is far more enjoyable than the metacritic score would have you believe. If you're looking for actual structured goals, Goat Sim has a few, but overall very little to offer in that regard. There are trophies hidden throughout the maps, some in clever spots. There are secret areas and tasks, some of which unlock things (other characters, jetpacks etc) which give you more ways to tackle stuff.But ultimately this game is just a stupid,♥♥♥♥♥♥around, ragdoll/physics simulator. If you're okay with having your IQ damaged, give it a whirl. It'll give you a few hours of fun. I happen to like screwing around and accomplishing nothing in games, and this entire game accomplishes nothing. It's a blast.Being drunk helps.Oh, but beware: certain things, like the Demon/Jesus goat and the softball launcher (which spawn game assets) will gradually slow the game down. There is NO garbage collector. Objects do NOT despawn. If you pick up/become something that creates objects, the game will start to perform worse and worse as time goes on. So that Restart button comes in handy.			"

												Do you have any hopes, dreams, or plans for the future?  Is there perhaps a girl you like, or a hobby you want to pursue?  Are you concerned for the well-being of your fellow man?More importantly, do you want all these good desires to go away?If so, Goat Simulator is for you.An hour with Goat Simulator will strip away all your desires and replace them with a brain-dead level of sociopathy that can only be decribed as how a zombie feels after a few too many beers.For example, I just now finished Simulating a Goat.Before my session as Goat, I wanted to pursue a career.  I wanted to serve God.  I wanted to ask out this one girl.  I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to achieve.  I wanted to be...human.Now, I feel nothing.  No desires.  No wants.  No needs.  No anything.I know I am hungry, but I don't want food.  I am thirsty, but don't want drink.This is not Nirvana.  This is a living Hell.  And in this Hell, there is nothing but... Goat.But srsly, this game is good for a few hours of giggles if you don't mind losing your humanity.7/10, penalty for temporary loss of player's soul.			"

												He knew his mission well, but it would not be easy. Gingerly, the brave magician stepped up to the catapult. It was meant for sheep, yet he was a goat. The guard, too preoccupied with his thoughts to note the magician's valiant, yet foolhardy act, noticed all too late.A crack. A rush of air. The caprine hero sailed through the sky, over the walls of Twistram, crashing painfully to the ground behind the church.An uninformed onlooker may have thought him dead. Surely no beast could rise again after its limbs had been twisted so completely. Yet rise he did, determined to complete his mission. Composing himself, he skirted the churchyard, spotting a gathering by the far wall. Sombrely, he joined the mourners, who stood with bowed heads at the graveside.Boom! His fireball sent them soaring in all directions, some crumpling against the walls of the church, while others flew from the clifftop into the sea. His agile tongue quickly flung open the coffin, seizing the fish that lay within. The villagers were returning, but the walls of Twistram were too high. Swallowing the fish, he dove off the cliff. His only hope now was to follow the coast until he reached the home of the elves...A gripping tale of might, magic, majesty, and a gigantic wizard pig! Well that's Goat MMO Simulator anyway... I haven't pulled myself away for long enough to try the other modes yet.			"

												I know that alot of people wrote a sarcastic review of the ""game"" but im here to give you the facts For one this is not a ""Game""  this it art. From the very beginning of the game, you are fully submerged in the corrupt world of appropriatley shaped food,endermen and spooky scary ninja turtles with shrek faces. But the more you explore the vast world, the more you absorb the pure beauty of the land. Feel free to party with deadmou5, go on a rollarcoaster, or even try some shrooms. This game is a passion, and i will allways remember its many hours of gameplay. Words simply cannot describe this game. It is by far the most decade defining thing ever to be found on steam, and i strongly recomend it. A true epic. Like skyrim with goats.11/10 never forget			"

Sometimes though it can get a little confusing if you don't pay attention. You might get lost in your goat's own history, take a peak into the future of GoatVille, or even reveal the dark side of GoatVille and see what the people are really up to. All in All, I give this game an 8.7/10.			"

Goat Simulator ReviewAnother one of those goat simulator games.This game is the best goating simulation game of the year. I understand it's hard to get so much success on a big gaming trend like goat simulation but this goat simulator was by far the best. I licked a car into a fence. It exploded. The game mechanics are amazingly complex, this is next generation stuff right here. If you're a fan of hilarious comedy, then go away. This is a game to be taken deadly serious. It's all about the way of life and how to goat properly. Let's face it, we've all tried to goat at one point. Most of us fail, so this simulation game is perfect for those that are currently unable to goat correctly. This game teaches you the full goat etiquette, law and physics. I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone over the age of 22 and under the age of 23. I hope you learned something from this review. The game is certainly worthwhile, but if you laugh at it, then you're a sick person! This is a very serious game! Thanks for reading!			"

												This game is far more enjoyable than the metacritic score would have you believe. If you're looking for actual structured goals, Goat Sim has a few, but overall very little to offer in that regard. There are trophies hidden throughout the maps, some in clever spots. There are secret areas and tasks, some of which unlock things (other characters, jetpacks etc) which give you more ways to tackle stuff.But ultimately this game is just a stupid,♥♥♥♥♥♥around, ragdoll/physics simulator. If you're okay with having your IQ damaged, give it a whirl. It'll give you a few hours of fun. I happen to like screwing around and accomplishing nothing in games, and this entire game accomplishes nothing. It's a blast.Being drunk helps.Oh, but beware: certain things, like the Demon/Jesus goat and the softball launcher (which spawn game assets) will gradually slow the game down. There is NO garbage collector. Objects do NOT despawn. If you pick up/become something that creates objects, the game will start to perform worse and worse as time goes on. So that Restart button comes in handy.			"

												Do you have any hopes, dreams, or plans for the future?  Is there perhaps a girl you like, or a hobby you want to pursue?  Are you concerned for the well-being of your fellow man?More importantly, do you want all these good desires to go away?If so, Goat Simulator is for you.An hour with Goat Simulator will strip away all your desires and replace them with a brain-dead level of sociopathy that can only be decribed as how a zombie feels after a few too many beers.For example, I just now finished Simulating a Goat.Before my session as Goat, I wanted to pursue a career.  I wanted to serve God.  I wanted to ask out this one girl.  I wanted to make a difference. I wanted to achieve.  I wanted to be...human.Now, I feel nothing.  No desires.  No wants.  No needs.  No anything.I know I am hungry, but I don't want food.  I am thirsty, but don't want drink.This is not Nirvana.  This is a living Hell.  And in this Hell, there is nothing but... Goat.But srsly, this game is good for a few hours of giggles if you don't mind losing your humanity.7/10, penalty for temporary loss of player's soul.			"

												If you like wasting time doing silly things this is as good as they get. Amazing freedom, constant updates (free and paid) and lots to unlock. Sandbox at its best. If you want a game with purpose, stay away. This is amazing brainless fun. But A LOT of fun. Even includes a minecraft-y goat that can build stuff. What more to ask???Also another plus, its one of the very few games without having to kill someone. Wouldnt call it non violent since you hit, kick, blow up, drop from heights, etc. a lot of people. But they dont die, no blood and it is not neccessary in any way. Up to you to do it.			"

												~Tried playing it with a friend for 10 minutes before realizing it wasn't an actual MMO~To pass onto serious matters. Goat Simulator is one of those games you buy just to relax after a stressful day of work, or Dota, for example. I love this game because it help me chill out and prevents me from killing myself. It offers 2 Maps to explore, and with the expansion a third one is added. You have collectables scattered across them and lots of cool Easter Eggs as well. Many bugs in this game, but most of them are just funny, rather than gamebreaking.The MMO expansion was added for FREE! (epic move) It will literally make you feel as if you're really playing it with other people... until you realize it is a simulation as well. Some skills and controls could've been made better as it's rather annoying to press 1 and E to take stuff but you can handle it. Collectibles and easter eggs in this one as well.>I'd give it a 9/10>Pros: Fun, sandbox, collectibles, cards, achievements, easter eggs and references, free expansion and updates(or so it is at the time I'm writing this), glitchy goodness>Cons: Some bugs require you to restart the map(collecting money which goes through floor etc), might get annoying to have to look for the remainder of the rare collectibles, it's not for everyone, perhaps the price tag is a tad bit high.

												Goat Simulator is a game that offers you fun times and tons of glitch(but in a good way).You can stroll, complete quest or do some crazy sheet its your choice. There are diffenent maps and each map has its own activities. My favorite one was MMO mode. It was  hillarous and enjoyable. Developers made this mode so realistic that you can think in your first play ''wait a minute is this real?''(i did). There are funny easter eggs and quests. Its not so long but has a diffenent taste. Classic modes cool as well. You can play it for stress relieve with destroying everything. And yeah i definitely recommend this game.			"

												Promoting violence and supporting the idea that goats are satanic creatures is Goaty Simulator. Murdering hundreds of people and corrupting an innocent town, as a goat you destroy a peaceful protest, launch people off cranes, and burn a gas station to the ground. Unrealistic gas prices, dictating over other dead goats, and sacrificing humans to recieve flying abilites are just a few of the absolutely unreasonal and irrational activities that can take place.10/10 would play again.

												Goat simulator is the perfect example of PC gaming accomplishing things consoles generally won't. This game shouldn't even exist. It does because the internet demanded it. As the developers said, your money is better spent elsewhere. I couldn't give up on goat simulator though. It is simply fantastic. It is a beautiful reminder of what it is to be a goat. Goat's aren't respected in our society, and hopefully goat simulator can change that. IT has all the love and care put into it that a Goat could ever want. ~PR0XIDIAN "

												Outnumbered and outgunned, but not outgoated.Goat® Simulator™, developed by Coffee Stain Studios (developers of Sanctum™), harnesses the first three-year, all next-gen development cycle in goat simulation history. Goat® Simulator™ envisions a powerful future, where both technology and tactic have evolved to usher in a new era of goat fidelity for the franchise.

This new chapter in the Goat® Simulator™ franchise features a new dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled goat fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive.Fueling this all new Goat® simulation experience, the franchise's new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance, all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms.

												NOTE: I have only played this game for 6 hours at the time of writing. My opinion about the game may or may not change by the time I play more of this game.Rate: 8.9/10I absolutely love this game. It is hilarious; you are a goat, you have a city to go around in and you can be different versions of goats, Perfect. The content in this game is pretty hard to run out of, a lotta things you can do. The good: I love the developers (I ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE SANCTUM 2, havent played the first one though) for working  so hard on the tiny little details, overall it can be a game changer (get it?).  Say, for example, the fireworks (Great addition by the way). Normally, a person won't pay too much attention to these things, but after a few hours of playing the game, you start to realize how well-developed the game really is. This is one of the things amongst many others (flappy goat, trampolines, for more examples). I like the way you can ride bicycles, interact with humans, become the goat lord (yes, you can summon peasant #PCMR), become a devil goat, slides are cool,  MINEGOAT, apparently ride stakeboards, mod the game, JETPACKS, become a super strong goat, explode cars, COMPLETELY defy the laws of gravity and tons of other things. The graphics are 9.1, by no means perfect.NEED TO MAKE A NEW PARAGRAPH FOR THIS: slow-mo. ♥♥♥♥IN AWESOMEThe bad: I cant really comment much on the topic of glitches, they are part of the fun this game has. What I can do is rant about the people in the game randomly going on top of fences among other stuff they randomly climb on top of. WHY COFFE STUDIOS, WHY?. I know it makes it funny sometimes but still, it annoys the crap out of me sometimes. *just playing flappy goat* WOOPS A GUY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TELEPORTS IN FRONT OF ME. Sanctum 2 didnt have any glitches, it was perfect like silver. Its a comepletely different game but damnnnnnnnnnnnnn it's annoying to have a guy come on your face. Another complaint: Maybe I am just a n00b or is it that some of the achievements are damn hard? No more to that complaint, just a bit hard. Another small complaint which is completely based off my opinion: There needs to be more references. I love the minecraft and sanctum 2 references (and a bunch of other changed-the-logo-so-I-dont-get-sued references), but it needs more.CONCLUSION: Buy this game if you are a bit into open world games, love trying to get achievements, love screaming, love goats and love funny/fun games.PS: Totally worth it, even though I was gifted a copyPSS: You are a goat			"

												It's like an old school Tony Hawk game but instead of Tony Hawk and skateboarding we play as a goat. You are free to fulfill any of your goat needs in this game. You can be a space goat and travel to outer space or you can be a acrobatic goat and do flips on a trampoline. You are free to do what ever you want and only your imagination stops you. The game includes an development kit so you can do your own maps and mods. It's welll worth the 9.99€ and has hours of fun and creativity. I strongly recommend this game for people that like sandbox game's like Garry's Mod. I think this game will pass on generation after generation and people are going to have epic goat stories.  tl;drYou can do whatever you want that is goat related and only your imagination is stopping you.This game gets an strong 9/10 and it will be played generation after generation.

												I don't know if I ""Get"" this game.  I've run around, I've blown up people, I've destroyed cars, I've let people ride me.  I'm a goat, hear me bleat!While Goat Simulator is a nice relatively simple game, it's just that, an overall relatively simple game.  It's not like a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ""simulators"" that try to cash in on Goat Simulator's success.  It's also not like the really well thought out simulators, like Bus Simulator or such. It's hard to really describe Goat simulator.  You're a goat, you run around and do anything you want.  You have bad animation, but you rarely look at the goat itself.  There's even a skate board ramp at one point, only thing is you don't ""Skate"" you just ragdoll your body and throw it around, and yet it works.  I don't know if I'd heavily recommend this game, because it feels unpolished at almost any angle, the animation of the goat is weak, and the ""game"" is... well I don't know if there's really a game. But it's still wicked fun to go run around the level and act like an animal.If you have a couple guys over and want to just have a blast, the local co-op actually works quite well.   Definitely good for a half hour of so of just laughter seeing what you can do.			"

												I own this game for the sake of my internet buds thinking I'm funny and randomIn all seriousness though, its just another garbage youtuber view bait game. I tried taking it seriously as a game, it's not good, I tried taking it as a joke. Its still not funny. Oh look, that exploded, and I got hit by a truck. Halarious. To be honest the most halarious part is how the devs don't know how to code and debug a game properly. ""It's bad because it's a parody"" Making a bad game to parody sub-par games is still making a bad game. 3/10			"

												I really like how silly this game is, but it also keep you wanting more. If they make some sort of expansion (I bet they already have.) I would gladly buy that expansion. It blew my mind how those water graphics were so perfect. I never saw anything like it. I would recommend this game to people who really like to laugh and do crazy things. It is a weird game. But in a good way. I gave me many LOLs. Anyone loking for a good laugh, buy a pack full of them for 9.99.			"

												Have you ever wanted to know what it would be like to be a goat?  Well this game perfectly simulates what a goat does in real life.  It even has realistic npc's that react to everything you do.  This by no means is a game that is meant for laughter.  It is to show what being a goat is like...well if they ruled the world.  Oh yeah, there is no A.I., everything just ragdolls when you ram it or even whack it with the car you held on to your goat/tall goat/feather goat/<insert name here> goat tongue.  10/10 would play again.

												Game is hilariously fun.  It's a rather unique concept, a remix of GTA where you are a goat instead, and instead of stealing cars, you blow the crap out of them.  It is good for many hours of fun, and the achievements are great.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't save.			"
