												The rollercoaster of feels from this game... great storytelling. I've only experienced 2 out of the 9 endings but from those I know I'll be playing again to get some the others too. You can either follow a guide online, or the game will give you tips if you fail along the way, which is pretty nice. But the save feature is bugged on some PCs, it doesn't matter too much though cuz if you fail you pretty much have to start over again anyways because of the stat-raising. It also doesnt support steam-overlay for taking screenshots, which is sad cuz theres some great art in here.The art is good all around, backgrounds and characters and 'action shots' are all well done.Overall this game was a good experience, lot of feels and 'romance' options that don't involve panty shots and boobs flying everywhere (which good be a bad thing?? I think it's a nice change of pace from recent VNs) Would recommend. Also do Oure's story.			"

												I LOVE this game!! After playing through 4 times (getting 4 endings) I finally got to an ending that didn't involve more death :DAt first I was expecting just some romance stuff, so dying so much caught me off guard ^^; The art is amazing, the story is awesome, the characters are deep and easy to bond with... what more can I say? Oh of course the music is great as well! I also really appreciated that there was some romance going on BUT it didn't take over the whole story (like it happens in games like this many times. which isn't a bad thing of course but...) and instead added to it. As for people criticising this game clearly without giving it a proper chance: please spread your negativities elsewhere. thanks. I definitely don't regret getting this game, and I'd do it again! And now... I'll go play it again xD			"

												X-Note is not a bad VN by any means, especially compared to many you can find on Steam, but I cannot honestly recommend it either. I wish there was an option to give a neutral review rather than just ""recommended/not recommended"".The visuals and music are decent; not exceptional, but they work. However, there seems to be no way to skip dialogue you have already read, which is frustrating when doing multiple playthroughs or simply trying again after getting a bad end.The story, while it has some surprises and good flow, especially when the pieces of the puzzle finally start to fall together, is sadly not very original. The writing is not bad, but nothing to write home about.Now, for the gameplay.The game is a mix of a classic mystery VN with choices influencing the story's direction and a ""raising sim"" which gives you the choice between three different statistics to raise, not unlike an RPG. I had never played such a game before, and was disappointed that X-Note does not make those elements work very well. Rather than influencing the path the story takes, the skills mechanic only seems to serve as milestones you absolutely have to reach before a certain point in the story, or else it's game over.At least the game gives you pointers so that you can avoid doing the same mistakes over and over again without knowing what was wrong.There are also a couple minigames thrown inside, but they aren't very interesting, and some tend to be frustrating.But X-Note's biggest flaw lies in its pricetag; 20 dollars/euros for such a short VN is a hefty one, and the main reason I cannot in good faith recommend this game.At the time of writing this, there seems to be a bug with its pricing; no pricetag is shown, and people have reported simply not being able to buy the game.

												Here's the run down: X-Note is a visual novel created by Zeiva Inc. You play as Essi, a psychic who's mother died ten years previous to the game, leaving her only with a USB flash-drive with a locked folder on it called ""X-Note"". Essi is approached by a young man named Yuon and invited to join the Xen Institute to investigate a murder and a disappearance that may be somehow connected to her mother's death and the X-Note. Essi accepts, and the mystery begins.Before you even play, there's one thing you should know: Bad endings seem rather inevitable without a guide. When a bad ending occurs, most likely you will have to replay the entire game over again. This happened to me on two occasions, and it does get very tiresome. If you want to go forth straight to get the endings you desire, you're better off using a guide. Though if you prefer going on your own, by all means, you should play without a guide. As a VN, the game is primarily text with quite stunning but unique artworks, with a few choices popped in here and there, plus mini-games to up your psychic powers (which I will talk about later). Sometimes the choices don't matter. Most of the time, they do matter and lead to a bad end if you don't know who's route you're going for. However, the routes themselves are quite short. You'll spend roughly an hour to an hour and a half going through one, depending on how much you struggle with the mini-games.There are three guys in the game you can go for: Yuon, Anon and Oure. I've only gone through Yuon's and Anon's, but they were both really great stories. I especially liked Anon's, for reasons I will not spoil. I do intend to go through Oure's, as there are still things I have not learned and you don't find out every mystery in just one play through which is what I really like about this game. It adds to the replayability and enhances the mystery. To be warned, there are some things are easily predictable in this game. But other times, I was pleasantly surprised and shocked to learn what this mystery had in store.Another key factor of this game is pretty much your ""skills"" of the game. Essi's psychic powers. You have the option to choose between Psychokinesis, Clairvoyance and Telepathy. Generally, one power is more helpful in certain playthroughs, depending on which guy you're going for. However, you're still going to want get them all up to max by the end of the game. I think the powers were a little bit of a let down mostly, as your character didn't change really whether you specialised in one form more than the others. There were not really any scenes where the outcome seemed to change drastically by what you had powered up more. I think this game could have improved a lot more if it had more focus on the psychic powers. They were critical in the big picture, just not to certain scenarios. To achieve these powers you must go through different little minigames (such as memorising and clicking at the right time) which grow to be quite challenging as the game goes on. They were quite fun, but at times I admit that I grew frustrated with them. If you can get this game on sale, like me, go for it. I still find that it is worth twenty dollars however, even if it is a little short. Overall, X-Note is a really a fun game, with a good mystery and some rather dark scenes within. You feel for the characters, some more than others, and Essi turned out to be an interesting protagonist, with her own quirks and interests (like obsessing over the colour black and drinking straight black coffee). The music is rather basic in my opinion, but nice to listen to and not annoying and repetitive. All the music sets very certain tones for the scenes, which kind of reassured me about what was going to happen next. The story is well written with lots of incentive to go through all three routes, the artwork is unique but lovely in my own personal opinion, and I'm pretty excited to keep playing and go for Oure's route. 7.5/10			"

												X-note: it's a visual novel based on a girl with some psychic powers that lost her mother,when the girl was younger, her mother gave her a USB with a file called X-note, that she can't open.Things a side: the game will only give you like 2-4 hours of entertraining.Overall game has a pretty intriguing story but it's not worth its total price try to get it from a bundle or on sale.

												X-note is a game I have been following since the demo was released on Zeiva's deviantART page some number of years ago (the demo is also available for free off of Zeiva inc's webpage: http://www.zeiva.net/). Seeing the full game now available on Steam was exciting and I was not disappointed.  The graphics, the characters in particular, were all very pretty and cohesive in style.  Atmospherically, the combination of horror themes, music and lighting were done well and used sparingly to create dramatic effect during those scenes.  The music was mixed frequently to help break the monotony of background sounds on a loop; plus the music was better than anticipated going into the game.  As a note, there is no audio for the dialogue and narration.Gameplay wise, the game relies on both choices and mini games which boost stats.  There are only 3 stats and only one can be trained via mini game per day.  The mini games are doable without being overly difficult for the casual player.  If you were to get a bad ending due to stats, the game gives helpful advice as to what to do for next time so it eliminates the need to go hunting online for a walkthrough.  There are 9 different endings, and each ending adds something to the overarching storyline.  My only critic of the game is that each path is relatively short and can be completed in roughly an hour.  However, the story is interesting, emotional and I look forward to the sequel Area-X.One nice thing to note is that anyone who has already purchased this game off of Zeiva inc's website may obtain a free steam code by e-mailing them the e-mail address that they purchased the game with.  It's hard to think of any other company that would do this.			"

												I am so f_cking sick of visual novels, they're usually longwinded and boring af (Eg. Fading Hearts if you're thinking of getting it, don't. Just don't.) however THIS one, X-note, that I got on Humble Bundle for barely a $1 actually got an intriguing story, the ""skip text space button"" isn't implemented in this game, and for a good reason. Unlike others in it's genre this one is a cut-to-the-chase story wise, and is making use of the next plane (userinteraction) well enough to actually be considered a GAME and not just some sort of virtual-click-through-manga-comicI actually spend mostly every minute I played in this actually *playing* through the game as well as following the story line! No skipping, except for a few parts that got a wee bit to technical for me. The kawaii desu manga-male characters in this are cute and funny (Oh, that Oure is a yumyum one) and it makes use of the natural japanese omg-what-a-perv sort of humor. Still it holds this seriousness that fits the storyline which is amazing. Also of course you're playing around as a just 14 year old girl lol. I was getting heavily into it during my first playthrough when I died, and the atmosphere around it while playing is creepy enough to set a memorable stage without it being one of those annoying horror games that has you lying awake at night.Anyway, if you like me hate the typical visual novels because they're longwinded and boring I'd definitely suggest this one, because it's better than the many, many others I've played. Yes, that includes the Flower Shop series.Basically a great, great game for its genre, I felt this game alone was worth more than the $1 I spent, even though I didn't expect it to at all.			"

												This is an all around good game. The art is fantastic and the music is nice. Well, the music is good, but it also sort of fades into the background while playing. The story is interesting and changes depending on the route you're taking making each play through less same-y.When it comes to playing the game it's both straight forward and not at the same time. There's a reason there are guides[www.zeiva.net] on the creator website and it's because you'll probably get only bad endings without them. They're official and mostly spoiler free, doing little but say what choices to make and what skills to raise by when.The actual gameplay is simple, every day you play a minigame to raise one of three psychic abilities and every so often you pick between choices, standard visual novel stuff. The minigames start off simple and grow harder as the story progresses, but you can save before trying, and fail a few times in a row before you have to either reload a save or fail for the day.One thing that is fairly lacking is how the abilities play into the game. You have to have certain abilities at certain levels to proceed and each love interest (Yuon, Oure, and Anon) has one that is extra important to their route. Otherwise, they aren't tied to the game. Skill level doesn't change dialogue, add extra scenes (except one additional scene after each LI's good ending), or require you to actually use them. Fairly anticlimactic really.As I said before, there are three love interests: Yuon, Oure, and Anon. I've gone through each of their routes, obtaining both their good and bad endings. I really enjoy all of them and recommend saving Anon for last. While you have to go through the same basic story to get through each route, the overall story you see changes a lot depending upon the route you're taking. It's both good and bad that you can't skip through already seen text, as there's little to the game that is superfulous and not plot related. However, going on your fourth time through it can get a little annoying with reading the stuff you just read thirty minutes ago again.To simplify things I'd make three saves on Day 5, before making any choice, one for each LI (preferably one save per page), then again at the beginning of Chapter 5 to let you go for both their good or bad endings. And really, use the guides[www.zeiva.net]. Do yourself a favor.			"

												This otome visual novel feature a female protagonist Essi who is an ordinary schoolgirl with latent supernatural powers. One day, she was approached by Yuon to study at Xen Institute and to investigate the deaths of her mother and several of the Institute's staff under mysterious circumstances. Along the way, Essi has to train and develop her latent powers through 3 different minigames, interact with a mysterious ally Rexus and develop a romance ending with Yuon who is the current director at the Institute, Oure who appears to be a regular student who frequently hangs out at a corridor inside the Institute or with Anon who appears to be the local computer expert within the Institute. The game has up to 15 save slots to enable quicker replays to reach a different romance ending or to see an alternative bad ending, in-game tips to guide the player to progress further to reach a better ending upon reaching a bad ending and a password system to instantly jump straight into a particular chapter with a certain storyline branch and skilltree progress or to unlock a special CG and soundtrack gallery.Soundtracks and overall game presentation are decent, it would have been nice if the game allows the take screenshot button on Steam to work. Recommended when at sale or in a bundle offer as all 9 endings can be reached and the entire game's unlockable CG and extra content at gallery can be completed in less than 10 hours.			"

												X-note is a visual novel that doesn't seem to be much at first...but ends up being a decent playthrough. I have a few facts and opinions to share about this game.Pros:+Good artwork+Good audio quality+The game has a full-screen option that actually looks good!+Pressing ""Esc"" will just put the game into windowed mode. IT WON'T EXIT THE GAME!!! :D+Very few errors grammar-wise+The characters are interesting+The ending is pretty good (well...the actual ending)+The game is fairly short, which I like for a visual novel+Fairly inexpensive game+Has an ""Extra Gallery"" to reward those people that get all the endings :)Cons:-Sometimes the audio cuts out suddenly when advancing to the next scene.-There are quite a few ""repeats"" of scenes...same dialogue, etc.-The game is sort of confusing sometimes. For instance, it took me multiple tries to get to the ending that is the best ending (there's no other ending that anyone could possibly want...trust me. The good ending is the best ending).-Sometimes the game will just decide to end, simply because you didn't put enough points into a certain ability.-The other endings...they...well, they suck. Really, they do.-Pressing ""X"" on the game's menu will not exit the game. It will lead you back to the main menu. Pressing ""X"" again will just reload the main menu...you actually have to exit the program by clicking the ""x"" that your OS uses.-Sometimes the music....is just lol....Overall, I recommend X-Note. It's worth a play. I'd recommend getting it at humblebundle while it's still $1. However, it's definitely not worth $20...I'd try and get it on sale for $5 or lower. Hope this review helped!			"

												Relatively short visual novel - takes about an hour to play through once.  Offers multiple endings based on choices made in the game giving it a degree of replayability.  I played thru four times.  That's enough for me but I could others wanting to do all paths.  The game gives tips at end of each chapter to help you get the varying paths on replay. Without them you'll be hard pressed to figure it out without looking up the answers on internet or trial & error, so that's really nice.   The part I like is  it let's you get thru the game, then tells you how you can get a different outcome if you choose to play again.   It does let you save so upon replay you can cut a few corners if you like but it only saves a few minutes. The story line is engaging and the music blends nicely.  Overall good experience.   I'll obviously caution about paying the full Steam listed price - get it in a bundle and yoll be happy.			"

												X-note is a very straight forward visual novel which is refreshing after playing so many with tons of endings and twist and turns. I was able to fully enjoy discovering the story without the worry of making a mistake that could set me back hours of game play (which has happened before in other games due to a poor save point choice on my part.)I also found this game the perfect length. Not to short that I feel as though I wasted my money and not to long that it feels as though it was dragged out more then it needed to be it get the point across.The art is beautifully and I enjoyed the look and feel it brought to the overall story since it fit very well. I can't wait to play more games by this developer because I'm really liking the stories they tell within their games.Overall I can highly recommend this game if you enjoy games with a interesting story with a bit of mystery, amazing art that adds to the setting and fits with the mood, theme and feel of what the game represents and a game that you are able to complete in a few hours and feel as though you had a great time playing when you have all the pieces of the story put together.

												I had expected this visual novel to deliver a bit more than it did. It is far too simplistic in everything, music, visual and story, even the mystery in the game didn't really hold my interest much, and I am normally a sucker for finding out the truths behind mysteries, but it is rather poorly excecuted in this game. The first ending I got was a very abrupt one where the protagonist ended up dead merely because I didn't raise the stats in the way the game had wanted me to. It's a poor choice, it should have been based on an actual decision and not some stats that had no relation to the event that caused my character to die at all. I am not even inclined to start over again to find out what would happen if I raise stats accordingly and so on the protagonist won't die. There are much better visual novels out there, especially for this price.			"

												A mediocre 2-5 hour mystery VN (high variation in time based on pursuing multiple endings).Where this VN does best is that it manages to work in some neat little surprises in how all of the dots connect together in such a short time frame. I definitely enjoyed the manner in which the story was exposed to the reader.I felt the artwork was a lot less lazy in X-Note than what I've seen from many other VNs of the same caliber. Kudos to the artist offering up far more assets than would be considered the minimum.Most of the other assets fit well into the passable category. For such a small VN, I still ended up finding the music mildly redundant. The engine could be better with offering better skip options through lengthy dialogs (pretty necessary for multi-path VNs, really) and options for scrolling up through previous dialog in case you missed something.The mini-games are fairly petty, but I can't say that they detracted from my experience much.The thing I hated the most about X-Note, are how the fail-states are constructed. There are 3 different character skills that you can upgrade, and those need to be at certain levels at certain milestones. There is very rarely any logic associated with why you need those skills to be at those milestones. Oh, you decided to shoot me in the gut because my clairvoyance skill wasn't high enough; thanks, game. The positive value of this unfairness is that you get to actually properly experience all the endings - whenever you get a bad ending, the game gives you tips on what you need to do to get the good ending.The ultimate reason for this review being negative is the base price-tag of $20. Nobody in their right mind should pay more than $10 for this, and my personal cutoff point would be around $5.			"

												Alright where to beginning...Well.. this is a Paranormal, investigative, dating sim, visual novel....You are a girl who's got special ablity that investiage though murder of your mom in the pass and murder of several other character in story.There is blood, there is death, and there is despire....It's actually quite well writen. For a visual novel this is one of the very few that don't have a skip button and will take quite a while to read though.The game it self is not long about 2-3 hours worth but if you want to get all 9 ending it does take quite a few save/load.You are given a lot different choice in the game and they really do matters so be careful when you choose them.Out of all 9 ending there are only 3 good ones. One for each boy that you choose... Please note if you made a choice.. stick with it. It's actually quite dark in the bad endings and I don't recommend weak minded people go try them.The art is wonderfully drawn as a visual novel. It's not up to *Eden standard but somehow the artist was able to put creepness though the fine print of character design, location design and etc. It's wonderfully well done.There are quite a few different musics in the story and they all sounds really creepy so it fit the mode of the game very well.IT's a visual novel so the game play is picking the choices.. the good thing is there is password save system that helps and if you get a bad ending. They actually tell you what you did wrong to improve that. It's restricted and quite hard to go for good ending but you can do it~~!I know it's a dating sim but it's really not about ""Dating"" more about investigative and story.There is also a sister serie just released on steam call area-X. I will try that one out in the future.As game 7/10 and as visual novel 8.5/10For those who like books about girls with power and a little romance and quite a bit dark investigation with a bit super natural murder involved... Give this game a try.It's probably not worth the full price but if you get it and try it. You shouldn't regret it.			"

												A story-rich mystery VN from Zeiva Inc. You play as ""Essi"" a hired girl to discover the murderer of your mother.  Graphics The artwork is pretty good for each of the characters and the overall design was well balanced, I loved it ;3 Score: 10   Storyline  The story starts off very slow which is one of the weak points I found, but it soon picks up around chapter 3...The overall story was beautifully executed (Of course, the story will be slightly different for all the 9 possible routes). At least try and achieve the ""Good End"", it’s very satisfying when you've completed it. Score: 9  Sound The soundtrack is mediocre, there is nothing special about this aspect, some of which are repeated a lot in various sequences throughout the whole game, which I didn't really like...nonetheless, it still deserves some credit. By the way, there is no voicing for any of the characters (I expected this anyways). Score: 5  Structure It’s a well-structured VN with a great story and beautiful artwork to make up for the not so impressive soundtrack of the game. Score: 8  Price For its price at £14.99, it is an expensive VN. The story, artwork and sound is certainly not worth the price. Maybe if the price was lowered down to £8.99, I would've said it would definitely be worth buying, but at its current price it’s an expensive VN. Score: 5 Overall Verdict: Despite the mediocre soundtrack and the high price, everything in this VN in itself is perfect. I was honestly quite surprised by how they structured the story together, I had a great experience reading it. I loved the amount of effort that was implemented in making this VN. Totally recommended!!!P.S. I will be reading Area-X soon. "

												I first bought X-Note years ago, and it was the first Visual Novel that I downloaded on my computer.  I was really excited when I heard about old buyers receiving steam keys for the game.  Even now, I still love X-Note and look back on it fondly.(My personal favorite character of the three boys is Oure because of his purity and gentleness.  In such a chaotic and enigmatic plot, Oure's dreamy qualities are beyond endearing!)That aside, Zeiva Inc. weaves together an exciting adventure with a captivating story, filled with mysterious secrets, developed characters, and even unexpected romance.  As the player progresses through the story, playing through each character's route, the story becomes more and more clear.  The artwork improved dramatically from the original v1.0 release.  While some scenes are proportionally awkward, the vibrance and atmosphere compensate for any shortcomings in the piece.The music is soothing.  My favorite piece is titled, ""Broken"" which plays during many climactic scenes.  The pianos in the composition suit the overall mood of the game.One downside to mention is the saving feature.  After each chapter, a code is given based on the choices the player has made.  Thus, players must keep track of their codes if they want to load their progress.  I remember I had dozens of them written in my notebooks!Even with a few grammar mistakes - English is not the developer's first language - X-Note explores paranormal and psychological activities.  While X-Note isn't perfect, it continues to be a Visual Novel that I will never forget.			"

												X-Note is an exceptionally well-polished game considering how few people worked on it. The story is revealed in parts during the various plot lines so you don't get the full picture until you've played them all. I thought the music was well-suited to the mood and I loved the artwork.My only problem with the game is that you cannot skip the skill training.

												Despite a VERY (and I repeat VERY) rocky start, this visual novel actually has three great stories to tell. The overall mystery of the story is very obvious, but the mysteries behind each of the three supporting characters are what puts this VN a cut above the rest.  Even the characters that seem the most cliche on the surface actually have more depth to them than you give them credit for, and the female protagonist who is initially very weak and boring, becomes pretty badass by the end.  I just wish that she was even moreso despite the amount of stat points that you put into her abilities. One would think that 10 pts of telekenesis should be enough to break someone's spine with a stern glance, not just blow a leaf.			"

												First off, this was my first time ever playing a narrative story like this, and I have to say, I'm glad I chose X-note! It's fascinating, mysterious and cryptic plus beautifully drawn and constructed. I thought this game would bore me easily at first, but within the first few minutes I was pleasantly sucked into this world. To me, it felt as if I was watching an anime, just without voice narrative and more moving pictures. This game has 8 endings and you have to get all 8 to unlock a secret section of the game, which I found cool. This game is amazing and I highly recommend you give it a shot, lets see if you to find the secret behind the School ^_^!!			"

												Absolutely amazing!! Of course, I'm a VN fan, but I really enjoyed the semi-dark plot and the fact that there were psychics involved. Also, I really appreciated that if you get a wrong ending it gives you pointers for what you needed to do. So far, I've only played Anon's route, but I would definitely recommend it.9.5/10!Can't wait for more from Zeiva!			"

												""X-Note"" is a visual novel (so if you don't like that genre, don't even bother), that tell story of 14 years girl name Essi. Essi have paranormal skills, that we, as players, will have to train in order to move story forward and get different endings. When Essie was a child, her mother died. It was considered murder, but the culprit was never found. She left her daughter USB called ""X-Note"". Essi believe that it may be the key to solve the mystery. She is contacted by Yuon - student of very special school (Xen Institute), who is fully aware of her skills. He ask Essi to help him solve the mystery of suicide one of the founder of Xen Institute. All of it seems to be linked to her mother's death. Game was created on Adobe Flashplayer and although this program works well with classic dating simulators, it isn't best choice for visual novel. I encountered issues with save files. Also, there isn't any way to skip seen text, which is very annoying, especially when you replay the game and just want to get a slightly different ending (or when your save file doesn't work...). As usual with this type of game, you'll find here potential romance. You can choose one of three boys. They are pretty interesting to some extend, I must admit, not your cliche romance characters, but in all honesty, I didn't really feel connection to any of them. Same goes for protagonist itself. Writing is solid. Plot is intriguing, though it tries to be serious, but it's too naive at times. It has this specific type of humor (in my opinion very out of place), where characters act completely unrealistic and just plainly stupid. Still, if you are fan o visual novels, this is definitely game worth playing. Not for full price though - wait for bundle or sale.Pros:+ graphic - CG's and sprites are really well done+ music+ intriguing philosophical angle+ good story... Cons:- ... but not that well presented.- plot holes- it gets boring really quickly- 14 years old protagonist - it's completely subjective, but I've had a hard time not only to link to this character, but also to consider her actions and reactions realistic for her age. Something didn't really work here.- low resolution- drama and humor very poorly mixed.			"

												This game has wonderful visuals and an amazing soundtrack, with great characters and an interesting story, I would reccomend this to a friend. It was very enjoyable and a lot of fun. I loved the mini games and really enjoyed the main three playthroughs with Yuon, Oure, and Anon. The only thing I don't like is a minor problem, not being able to skip previously read dialog, but it is exacctly that, a minor inconvenience.			"

												I cannot reccommend this game. Not that it's terribly awful, it's just not worth the listed price. Personally, I had a hard time getting into it. The story isn't all that compelling, which wouldn't be a problem if it had more gameplay elements. But literally the only gameplay is picking an attribute to increast, and dialogue/story choices. I generally like Visual novels, and a good VN can keep me glued for a solid 5 or so hours. But this didn't keep me wanting to keep reading.I have also played Train of the Afterlife, and Voices from the sea, and they also suffer from similar writing issues.I cannot objectively say that this VN is bad, because people obviously enjoyed it. It just isn't my kind of Visual Novel. That said, I do want to encourage the Developer because I like seeing Indi Visual Novels.			"

												If you’re interested in this game then chances you are both someone who likes visual novels, and someone who likes a mystery story.  Unfortunately this game is good at neither.  I was put off by the Mary Sue vibe in the beginning of the story where the main protagonists are doing things and interacting with other characters without providing relevant context to the reader.  The writing is bland, generic, and feels like a middle school project and should not be read as a piece of entertainment.  The software lacks many common features found in visual novels: for example, hold ctrl to skip dialogs, an internal volume controller to make the bgm not blasting loud, etc.Anyway, this game is not worth your time even if you manage to get it for free.Edited for grammar and precision.

												One Sentence Summary- If you like graphical novels, you'll probably like his game.If you are not familiar with them, you may like it, you may not. All in all, the game plays as if it is 80% graphical novel, and 20% like an actual game. First, let me say the positives:+Nice Artwork+Fun characters+Appropriate Music+Very much like a Japanese Anime (if you like that)+Is mostly based upon a mystery, but has some romance elements+Thankfully, as far as I can tell, the romance elements are fairly clean and innocent.+Multiple Endings-Doesn't seem like the choices you make alter the story very much.-You play as a teenage girl in a game with some romance elements (a minus if you're a guy)-The game ends very abruptly if you get the bad ending, which I did.-Unless you have some foreknowledge, most people will have to start over to get past chapter 4 (I think). This should be optional to get a better ending, but it feels punishing to make you start over from the beginning in order to progress further.As to whether or not I recommend this game, I'm on the fence. If you like this type of game, get it on sale. If not, get something else. However, the game is fairly good for what it is, so I'll give it a thumb up.			"

												This is not my first ever visual novel, however it is the most recent one I've played in a long time.The music is pretty good, and the art is absolutely fantastic. Definitely top quality in those realms.The story is fairly interesting, and it kept me entertained, but only the first time through, as I was trying for different endings I was speeding through the dialog. There is a hilarious parady of a particular O/S that is quite funny imo.My biggest complaint is with the 'advancement' system. There are specific requirements you need to have obtained to 'pass' certain chapters and continue the story, however, the reasoning behind those requirements just don't exist and are never mentioned. Without giving anything away, imagine you need a 6 out of 10 strength to stop a heavy bookshelf from crushing you, but unfortunately you only have a 5... so you die. Fair, I get it. With a six you live... Fine. Makes sense. What doesn't make sense is lets say you need a 6 strength to pass this chapter, and if you don't have it, you can't pick the lock of the door and get caught by an evil gerbil and die. Nonsense? I think so. And that is part of what irritated me with X-Note. The requirements didn't make sense. However, I did indeed enjoy playing the game, once I managed to just ignore the requirements and put sanity on hold. I'm still working on getting other endings, so in that sense, I'm still playing.I'd have to give it a 7/10, worth getting, but definitely not at full price. Wait for a bundle or a major discount.

												Incredibly frustrating to play. I've heard good things, but couldn't get more than 10 minutes in without bungling things repeatedly. Advancing text dialogue is done with arrow keys. ENTER skips the entire chapter. Or something. All I know is that I read some dialogue, did a mini-game, and hit ENTER when I couldn't click out of it, and I'd missed a whole day's worth of dialogue. If the controls are that terrible, I'm not going to spend my time with it.			"

												Look, the raising sim part doesn't do much. It doesn't affect much of the game, and it only has some changes to it.

The characters are kinda cool, the art is kinda good, and you can like the story and the others aspects of this game.But, for me, at least, it is a ""play once"" game onlyThe developer has some other games that are really worth looking into, though.

												Ah, X-note. I started playing this game because of Area-X, and before I played Rexus' path I realized I didn't want to be spoiled for X-note and thus downloaded it to play.My recommendation for doing the routes: Yuon - Oure - Anon. Even Zeiva recommends doing Yuon's route before Anon's. The way I see this: Yuon's route establishes the game to an ending; Oure's route changes a few things in Yuon's route (kind of like a what if, but don't worry, doesn't change the plot), while Anon's route answers quite a lot of questions and mysteries that this game contains.What I liked:- mini-games were related to the story plot- the artwork - anyone who likes Japanese artwork will like this one- the story plot was nice, although interestingly you don't find out the mysteries all in one path (perhaps a smart move by Zeiva to get people to replay routes), although  you don't find out everything, like Emma's death - was it really caused by Scid? Or did Loil lie and it was really caused by him? Or was there a bigger mystery behind it? We'll perhaps never know - the characters, while at first glance look similar to otome archetypes, are actually deconstructed (to some extent) in their routes, especially Oure and Anon. Much props to this, but then since Zeiva had intended to parody the archetypes in the first place it's really not that big of a surprise. Special mention goes to Anon; I didn't think much of him initially, and even during Yuon and Oure's paths, but his path certainly surprised me. A pleasant surprise, don't worry. Anon is easily the most interesting and complex character in the whole game, and I say this as an Oure fan. I shudder at how much he must have suffered when he was younger - from witnessing war, to being accused of nasty things, to being bullied, to accidentally 'murder' his best and only friend, and when he didn't use his powers he still caused pain. No wonder he tried to commit suicide - at the age of six. Also, when Essi was in his mind and cried that it was really dark and painful, you have to wonder just what kind of scars he had, and how much he must have been suffering his whole life. Considering the implications that he would have committed suicide if Essi didn't pursue him, he made for an ultimately tragic character. While Oure is described as the ultimate victim of the game, which I don't disagree, Anon is a big victim in this game as well. Arguably, they all are victims of circumstances in ways. - the music was appropriateWhat I disliked:- the minigames were somewhat difficult when you try to max out the stats, and it gets ever more tedious and frustrating when you replay routes to see other endings. Much as I like how the minigames are integrated into the story plot, it also makes me grind my teeth to have to play Psychokinesis III for the Xth time (pun not intended). Although, with the save/load function, it does make it easier - I shudder for those that played V1 of this game.- Loil.  As a villain, I expected more from him; yes, the game does establish him as the Big Bad, and a psychopath (sociopath?) who has no qualms to use anybody and everybody to satisfy his own goals and desires. That being said, he still kind of fell flat compared to the main characters (I'm not comparing him to the secondary characters, he should be more fleshed out as the villain); why did he do what he did? Anon's path does answer this to some extent, but it's not enough. We never really see why Loil did what he did. Another peeve is how he basically gets away with everything except in Anon's bad ending, and even then I didn't like it (poor Essi). Since this game isn't all that realistic in the first place, Loil should have been served what he deserved, but he wasn't, and furthermore, the times where he just retreated quickly after being confronted by Essi (and others) was just weird - he would bow down in defeat so easily? Considering how far he went to remove 'obstacles' in his path, this seemed rather OOC for him (could be argued that because he was up against psychics, which made him realize he was no match for them, but even that feels too flimsy - Zeiva could have had him fight harder, but they didn't). All in all, Loil was a pretty unsatisfying villain, which I'm chalking up to because Anon was intended to be the villain, Loil wasn't fleshed out that well than if Anon had remained the villain.All in all, while I did enjoy X-note, I still found Area-X to be superior. And I'm saying this as someone who has only played 2 routes in Area-X (Belph and Yuras), while I've completed all 9 endings for this game. This isn't a bad thing; Area-X being newer and better, means that Zeiva is improving with time, which is always a good thing. Though, that being said, it remains a debate whether getting this game at $20 is worth it. My opinion? If you enjoy OELVN, and otome games (but beware that while romance is an aspect, it isn't as overwhelming as other otome VNs, like those of Voltage and NTT Solmare, for instance), and mystery and paranormal aspects, then get this; but if you're on a budget, you might want to consider other offerings.

												I've only played one route so far (Willing to stay up an extra 3 hours for it). Was it worth it? 90% of me says yes, the other says no. I just wish the story with Oure was longer, but I guess that's how they draw you in. Although getting past chapter 4 was a pain in the behind so I looked up passwords and a walkthrough. (Also worth it after becoming close to rage quitting).The tips were helpful but not enough seeing as I always got Yuon's birthday invite (ick). Either way, was it worth the money? Maybe, i'll play the rest and see, but I wish Area-X was also on steam. More romance options so more worth. Still All and all, good game, interesting story, keeps you guessing a little.			"
