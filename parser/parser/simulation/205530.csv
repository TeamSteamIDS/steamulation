												Gratuitous Tank Battles can be an incredibly fun and rewarding game. Remember the fun it was to build your own custom ships on games like Master of Orion? GTB is a tower defense game that's like that for every single unit or turret. From the smallest cheap gun to the big strongholds, from inexpensive recruit infantry to heavily shielded mechs.Designing the units is simple, but the management of new and older designs can be a little busywork. But this kind of complexity that usually lacks on modern games is very welcomed.The very fact that this games plays as both a traditional tower defense game and an inverted tower defense game is a testimony to its flexibility. It's a robust selection of units with great variation of strategies you can use to beat the enemy.At least for me, the fact that you can design, customize and name every unit in the field adds to the enjoyment and creates a very fun experience when your guys are winning a battle. It's just most interesting when that tank unit you built to be fast and strong barely makes it to the finish line.Building units is not everything, and the battles are intense and complex.Apart from the built-in campaign, you can edit your own scenarios, and upload and download challenges from other users.If you like Tower Defense games or games with customization, this is a very good choice.

												This game is good. It's really good. If you love making customized units that you can later on watch in combat, then this is a game for you. As for gameplay, I can describe this one as a combination of Close Combat series (the top down camera style reminded me of those games) and Anomaly Warzone series.The thing that I loved the most is that you can create your own units based on a variety of hulls, and once your'e done with the campaign maps, you can go and play any map that other players have created. You can even create your own maps and upload them so that everyone can give them a try.I am not saying this game is a triple A quality title, but it's a really neat and well presented indie product that can give you many hours of fun, and it definitely earned a rating of at least 75%. When you look at some mindless and pointless games that have been awarded with 90+ by the Steam community (Goat Simulator being one of those) you can only begin to question how ignorant the community is nowadays, but trust the gaming veterans like me and get this game, you won't regret it. IF you're still indecisive, wait for a discount.			"

												GTB is a forward thinking tower defence/RTS hybrid for all you serial tinkerers out there. It comes with a 12 mission campaign right off the bat and coupled with the ability to attack or defend (two modes of play which feel like entirely different experiences in themselves) you’ve got essentially 24 missions before you go anywhere near the game's extensive customisation options. Between the unit and level editor, the built-in online challenge sharing and the adaptive AI that's capable of wielding your own designs against you, there’s a potentially limitless amount of content on offer here. Highly recommended.For more detailed impressions visit: http://tap-repeatedly.com/2012/07/impressions-gratuitous-tank-battles/ "

												Ok, maybe i need to have more time to discover how to use my units correctly (4.4hrs when i wrote this) and maybe i suck ♥♥♥, but i can't help feel that there is just way too much going on to take in. GSB did feel like that at first but i think what kept me playing that is because i was able to distinguish better what worked and what didnt. With GTB however, it feels more like, ""spam more than the enemy can handle"" kind of game.When i tested out my own custom units as an attacker, i did win, but i couldn't quite make out how i did with what designs were effective and it felt like it was just all about spamming faster than the enemy can place its units down. I did see a couple of units really stand out but that was all i was able to take in and didn't feel as if they made a real impact to the game and was more about having more guns than my enemy to break through their defences.As the defender, different story, after a solid 40mins of deciding what to put in my turrets and so forth i used them in battle, but it seems as though my theory of ""the spammier the better"" really came to fruitition as my enemy was constiantly fielding units that eventually meant i couldnt keep up with stopping the flow with the supplies i needed. I admit, i may have made classical n00b errors, such as not using the speed settings to help me better make sense of the battle (D'oh), and i noticed how most of my turrets were fitted into Anti-Armor roles. Maybe i just need to go back to the drawing board like i did with GSB, but honestly, after playing a few games of what felt like ""the spammier the better"", i saw no point and scrapped all of my turret designs.You see with Space Battles i was able to figure out roughly where i went wrong if i lost a battle. Sometimes it was a design that ended up being obsolete with enemy designs or not being able to fill the role i intend it to. But with Tank Battles it didn't feel like that at all. It felt more like all of my units were at fault and the unit stats at the end did nothing to help me at all. I just couldn't make sense of all the information being given to me.Though as i said at the beginning, i probably suck and need to put more time into this game for its goodness to really shine, but it felt like a real dissapointment from its Space counterpart, and besides, i have never been one for Tower Defence style games anyway as i always find the genre having little strategy and mainly focusing on who spams best. Tank Battles seems to be the same story then as always for me, just with customisation of units being a nice feature to it all.5/10. A game that looked promising along with the customisation features but maybe that is due to my love of its space daddy counterpart. Overall, i am dissapointed, hope i can come back to this and it convinces me to change my mind.If you love TD games, this may be for you but may not be exactly your cup of tea, and all the customisation and info that this game bombards you with may put you off in the end, aside from that, i advise you save your £6.99 (£11.98 with the DLC included) for a rainy day and look elswere.And as for me, i am off to play GSB in order to cheer myself up by blowing alien ships up for no apparent reason, at least i can make sense out of all the chaos...oh well...*readies plasma cannons* toodles.

												The pseudo-sequel to GSB patches up a lot of things that its predecessor didn't do as well.  You now have to equip something in every slot of your models, you can customize their appearance much more, the battles are asymmetric and you have to control things instead of passively watching, and the different maps provide a lot more variety than the void of space.  I would recommend it more highly except that the battles take so darn long.  I'm sitting there for 15, 20 minutes or more, either fending off waves of enemies or throwing my troops into the grinder, and there's still half the mission to go.  It feels more slog than fun, sometimes.  It just… lacks something, some ineffable quality that other TD games have.  Also, the unlock system was partially better in the previous one.  I'm many games in, and most of the way done with the campaign, but there are still bunches of things to be unlocked.  The other one gave you points for every victory and you could just buy the things you wanted in the store (often several for a good-scoring mission), but this one gives you one scripted thing and a choice between 2 other equips after each fight.  This is good in that the scripted ones ensure you get the important stuff first, but bad in that it takes a lot of missions to unlock everything.  Jury's still out on the balance, but it's replaced its predecessor's ""here are 5 equips that vary slightly from each other"" for any given category with ""here's a small, medium, and large thing - what'll it be?"".  That, combined with the fact that attacker and defender use almost the same gear, means that I'm skeptical of the potential variety.  Will have to play it more.Ed. So, after coming back to it for a while, I don't think my views have changed.  It still feels like your decisions are mostly dictated by the map and your budget, not your overall battle plan.  There's room for creativity in unit design and deployment mixes, but the fact that you can only put guys/turrets/support structures in pre-defined places really limits how you can play the level.  For the attacker, it's even worse, since you have to send your troops down specific routes, and they always seem to get snarled up by traffic jams.  The game lacks any realism in having wrecked tanks block your way, but injured ones at the front of the line will still slow you down.  The attacker is supposed to have the advantage at the start, since they get more cash more quickly, and the defender later, since they never run out of income and keep all their non-destroyed defenses on the board.  However, it really feels in most maps like the defender has an overwhelming advantage from the get-go.  With the right placement of troops and turrets, they can get such a volume of fire in one spot that your line of vehicles, advancing single-file, will get picked off one at a time before they have a chance to do much damage.  And if they have a repair yard nearby, what little damage you do inflict will be fixed in no time.  Perhaps I just haven't hit on the right combination yet, but this seems somewhat shallow to me, as the first one did.It's still not a bad game, and worth exploring for a while if you enjoy this type of thing.  There's a lot of replay value to be found in the maps and the asynch multiplayer skirmishes.			"

												I personally enjoyed this. While the game can be a bit slow at times, it takes a while to get tedious or boring. The wide amount of options for creating unts means there's great room for variety in playstyle, and part of the tactics for this game is not just what units to send/place, but also what in what order or what combination of weapons will pair best.The game may get a bit formulaic after a bit, but it takes a while and is great fun up until then.

												Though I really enjoyed Gratuitous Space Battles, I found this one thoroughly inferior. The customization found in GSB simply doesn't exist in GTB. There's no actual modification available, really. You simply unlock new items and those new items are, basically, always better. Whereas in GSB, you had to balance crew-size, energy, weight, cost; in GTB it's basically cost and that's it. NOT recommended.			"

												I love it.  And for everyone who hates it just because it's different from Gratuitous Space Battles, and base your argument on hating it on that, go away.  It's simply part of the same series of games, but that doesn't mean it can't be different.  Just because it's different from the last game doesn't mean it's horrible.  In fact, I love it.  The customization aspect of both games is great, the mechanics from both games are solid, the graphics aren't the best, but I like the art style.  It seems that many people hate that it's a Tower Defense, or maybe hate the asymmetric gameplay.  Personally, I like both games and have both installed.			"

												Excellent sci fi strategy game. The ability to customize every unit with all sorts of components and augmentations is a tweaker builders paradise. Reminds me of the fun i used to have designing battlemechs for the board game version of Fasa's BATTLETECH back in the 1980s and 90s. When designing new tanks, mechs, troops, turret defenses etc you have to observe how each one effects the other. You may design a walking mountain of destruction but if its engine isnt strong enough it will be running as slow as a snail giving the enemy plenty of time to tear it to pieces with laser,plasma,canon, machine gun fire among many other lethal forms of weaponery and defenses. Another cool thing about the design process is you can paint your units to whatever paint scheme you want. Sound effects are brutal with the screams of infantry dying in agony as giant flamethrower type canons burn them into charred flesh or machine gun fire creates a field of dead bodies lying in pools of blood. All the while the battle cries of those still living permeate the carnage filled air with combat rage. Giant mechs stomp the ground below them with thundering earth shattering effect. Titanic tanks the size of Keith Laumer's BOLO units crush all with their mighty treads as they blast away at long range with their world destroying arsenal of weapons. Graphics are very well done with a rpg board game feel to them similar to Steve Jacksons CAR WARS with an impressive level of zooming in where units do not lose their level of visual detail.  Seeing trenches filled with the dead bodies of infantry in pools of blood definitely gives off a visceral thrill of massive carnage reminding me of the war scenes in the future in THE TERMINATOR. Tanks and Mechs burn in smoke trailed flames and show battle damage as they annihilate all in their path to reach their goal. Game play comes in two forms where you defend or attack. I have never played a tower defense game before but that is what this is supposedly called though to me it reminded me more of mech combat in CYBER EMPIRES by Silicon Knights back in the 1990s where you destroy or defend against waves of enemies. Here the goal is to defend against waves of enemies or acttack while fighting your way across the map to exit thus reaching a certain victory score once enough surviving units have exited the map. This may sound easy but one of the coolest and incredible things about GRATUITOUS TANK BATTLES is its adaptable ai where the game adjusts its combat to your play style constantly changing to your new tactics. All the while the ai never feels like its cheating. During battles you may also end up getting supply drops allowing you to get things like free supply trucks into the field which will add huge amounts of victory points if they make it across the battlefield.GRATUITIOUS TANK BATTLES if your into designing units and then sending them off to battle to see how they will destroy or be destroyed then this is the game for you.

												I bought this game because I enjoyed Gratuitous Space Battles enormously. What a disappointment! This game appears to be a quick and dirty attempt to profit from GSB. You get a few maps to learn from and then nothing but the same map over and over and over, with suggestions that you should play on-line to get a better experience. Maybe I am missing something, but I can find none of the maps shown in the Steam advertisement available as single player mode in the game.			"

												Gratuitous Tank Battles is a polished tower defense game that offers a staggering level of unit customizability, a painless registration process, good video settings detection as well as a thorough tutorial. Both widescreen and the Steam Overlay are supported, but there is no controller support. The terrain graphics are subpar both flat and bland, but the units are 3D and the full zoom helps compensate somewhat. The music is quite well done and compliments the gameplay well. For strategists that like a deep level of customization and a large variety of scenarios with which to test them, this is an excellent purchase.			"

Space Battles would had never been even half as succesful if it would had been a Tower defense game so I don't understand why deviate from that succesful pattern they had going with the previous game?

												Ok, so I invisioned this game to be a little bit different when I first heard of it. It's still good, but has a LOT of things that drags it down.This game puts you in the early 22nd century, after World War 1 has been going on for a LOT longer than it should have. You get to 'control' entire armies and defensive positions as you duke it out in a tower-defense like game. I still don't really get why its a TD game, but what the hell, its a game.Pros:- You can actually customize how your units look with paints and other parts.- Damage system is just like Space Battles, making it familiar with GSB players.- You can play as either the defender or the attacker.Cons:- Seemed a little mediocre, as GSB actually had tactics and, well, was more fun.- The only tactic is literally just spam units until you win for the offense.- The defences are really weak, still taking at least 10 hits to destroy a light tank, or even a light mech.Overall, it is a decent game. It wasn't what I would have liked to be, like tanks, mechs and infantry on an OPEN BATTLEFIELD! Firing almost non-stop at eachother with lasers, machine guns and big-♥♥♥ guns. I guess that I had too high hopes.I rate this game a 5/10 (Average game). For all of the GSB fans, this is not the game you would want. It is really restrictive to how you play, as there are no real tactics and, well, it just isn't fun in the long run.			"

												A game that lives to it's name, but really nothing beyond that. There really isn't a ""story"" or really anything to latch onto outside the actual battles. Don't get me wrong, I love tank battles, war games and post-apocalyptic fiction, but I need more than simply attacking or defending certain areas.			"

												I love tower defense games (and games with a similar feel) and this game does not disappoint.  The one twist that GTB has that I haven't seen in any other games is that you get to play as the attacker.  Very quickly, you are essentially forced to use custom designs since the computer AI is quite unforgiving but that's a good thing since it requires adaptation and actual thinking.  If you like tower defense games and/or Gratuitous Space Battles, get this game.			"

												This game is pretty fun once you get the hang of it.  The learning curve is a bit steep at first though.  You need to stick with it until you get some of the upgraded equipment.  Also, designing new units is a large part of the game - sort of like the old Mechwarrior series.  But I've been having a lot of fun with it lately, and given how cheap it is, I'd say it's well worth the money.			"

												Gratuitous Tank Battles Review - Raymond KTMind you, I just don’t like tower defense games. Pricing at the same as Torchlight1+2 combined is ludicrous. I mean the game is alright, it's your default tower defense game with inferior graphics. You get literally thousands of those for free on any flash site. Would consider trying it yourself on a sale. But don't spend more than 5 bucks on this. Not that good and from what I've seen on the internet the creator is extremely arrogant. Offputting			"
