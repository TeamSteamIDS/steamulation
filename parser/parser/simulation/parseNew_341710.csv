Early Access Review
								Crest is a light-hearted take on a god simulation game currently being developed by Eat Create Sleep and is in the last stages of Early Access here on Steam.In the game, you are a god and you are given a small island civilisation to rule over... you in a way, play an omnipotent parent who watches your children grow and live their lives. You can guide them and instruct them by issuing them three symbol commandments (condition, the action you want them to do, and the target the action is for) which they can interpret and follow. For instance, you can instruct unhappy people to move out and form a new city or build a new hut or you can urge well fed followers to gather metals or lumber. Pros + Simplistic minecraft like graphics that both my laptop and desktop could run with highest settings on+ No stuttering during my gameplay.+ Nice concept and take on the genre+ Terrain can change by the amount of rainfall the island gets and by how you prioritize + The game is very relaxing to play after a stressful day+ Music is relaxing and fits well with the game, isn't overbearing.+ Easy learning curve Cons - No saves at the moment, though devs say the save cloud is coming soon- No Achievements or trading cards- No way to see what the results of your commandments are, and no way to tell if your followers interpretted the commandment the way you wanted- Cannot terraform the land or build things - Cannot currently explore and inhabit other islands- Cannot advance tecnology- Repetitive after a few games- Games last maybe 15-20 minutes due to early access. Dev's say gameplay when out of early access will be 1-2 hours each playthrough. Neutral  There are seventeen unique symbols that represent everything from metals to food and young people to old people, but I wish there were more symbols to represent actions/wishes because I feel the game is still too restrictive at times, since I'm supposed to be this omnipotent being. Adding 5-6 more would be a great bonus. Final Thoughts Crest definately has a lot of potential as a god simulation game, and it seems that the developers really care about the game as they've taken suggestions from players and update the progress page quite frequently. While the game is short as it is right now, the developers are on the right path to make this a great game in terms of balancing strategy with simplicity and adding more features. As it sets, this game is not complete, but given the small price of $5 in USD, it's definately not going to be a waste of money if you enjoy games like this. The game in its current state, I give a 7/10 and when it's out of early release I will probably update the review again to give my thoughts of the completed game. **As this game is still in early access and has been since I wrote the original review, I have decided not to update this review as I feel it will never leave EA**			"

Early Access Review
								I'm recommending this game not because I think you should buy it, but because I think you wishlist it and check back in a year. This isn't a game in its current state, its a simulation and not a very entertaining one at that. First, I think this is supposed to be a critique of religion? I couldn't find any way to have positive interaction with my followers. If you leave your people to their own devices, they will flourish - farming, hunting, mining, and making new babies and founding new cities. If you do try to send out a commandment (the only way to ""play""), one of three things will happen: The most likely outcome will be that your followers completely ignore you. This is the most frustrating, but its not as if the entire Bible isn't filled with similar stories. Of course in the Bible, God would punish the people in some way, while here there is nothing you can do except repeat the commandment. The second most likely outcome is that the command will be ""reinterpreted"". So if I said, ""The hungry should eat"", the people will somehow come to the conclusion that I meant ""The hungry should mine."", which is annoying, but is kind of the crux of game. But the very worst outcome, in my opinion, is when the people actually listen to what you say... because they will suddenly forget all their needs and focus 110% on whatever the command was. So if you say ""the young must mine"", they will start mining...and will only stop once they have starved to death. My greatest frustration, however, isn't with the fickle nature of my people, but with their lack of true culture or religion. Your proclamations aren't entered into some holy book or impressed upon a leader - they are either immediately implemented or immediately ignored, and no matter what, are erased from your ""list of commandments"" (and your followers memories), after a minute or two. The next generation will not be influenced by the orders you gave the previous one, except in how much food and metal your commands ultimately generated for them. The developers have promised futher development for a city/culture system, as well as an ancestral link system, so hopefully that will work out.			"

Early Access Review
								Crest is a coll little variation on a God game, where you pass down slightly fuzzy commandements, which people sporadically ignore, follow even after it stops being relevant, and take way too seriously, even it leads to their deaths, possibly making this game the most subtle and clever critique of religious fundamentalism in any game.It's a fun idea, and the graphics are cute (especially the awesome triangle-mane lions), but the game is possibly-intentionally a bit frustrating, as you can't directly control or instruct your followers. When you get your commandments right, it's cool to watch a community grow and prosper, but things can be wrong and it can hard to recover.The islands are currently a bit small and lacking in variety too, quickly ending up either exclusively lions or exclusively gazelle depending on your religious view on lions.In its current Early Access form, I'd give it a modest recommendation, and I'm interested enough to give it another look when the commandments get more complex in the coming iterations.

								A pleasant diversion with little interaction from the player.You give commandments to tell your people what to prioritize, and they mostly do so. They mine, harvest food, make babies, get flooded-out, then die. If you speed it up, a civilization takes about 5 minutes before everyone dies. The devs are completely up-front about a playthrough lasting 15-30 minutes, and that seems accurate. I assume that meant on the slowest setting, with the fastest being triple-speed. It's fun to watch, but there isn't a lot going on, at the moment. There also isn't much for you to do as a player.If you sometimes find yourself playing a two-minute hand of solitaire while doing other things on your computer, this is a perfect game to mix up your card-matching routine. There is very little strategy and not much of a late-stage to be reached, though, so be wary if you're looking for something complex.All in all, it's exactly as-advertised in the Early Access information, and is solidly play-able in its current state.

								In it's current state, Crest is all about experimentation. You give your followers commandments, and hope. Hope that what you thought you were telling them is actually how they'll interpret your wishes. I made a 'first look' video where I tested the commandment system. If you're looking to pick up this game, perhaps I can help with your purchasing decision. :)

								Crest dares to experiment and explore the God game genre. Breaking traditional conventions of you smiting or leading your people by divine acts or wrathful fire. Instead your intentions and words are spoken through commandments. Your followers interpret what these commandments say and can end up doing many different actions. From basic farming/mining to cannibalism. However Crest still has a long way to go. The AI of your followers can sometimes be rather wonky. Fetching resources on the other side of the island. While there are a variety of commands and suggestion for you to give. Only a couple of them truly seem to matter.  While experimentation is key, the game moves at a rapid pace. Each session is only supposed to last anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes. I found that with the wrong commandment, it can last 5 minutes. While rapid replayability and changing environments are a great idea. The game doesn't leave you much time to go off the beaten path. Over all the gameplay works, but you end up feeling like your watching an ant hill that is suicidal. While the hands off approach is the point of the game. It leads to some frustrating moments and lack of excitement. Mind you, balance will be implemented during development. Graphically the game is stylized and I enjoyed it. The way the land evolves as it rains, droughts, and is farmed. Adds a feeling of evolution to the area. The followers shift gear for different tasks and perform a strange mating dance. The music and tone of the game is done well. The game also has very little bugs. I enjoy the idea of Crest and the game has potential. It speaks of building a legacy and seeing it live through your people. I want to see more of this in the game. I hope by the time It's fully released, we will.I made a video preview to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

Early Access Review
 Disclaimer - I have been gifted a free key for this game for review purposes, however my review will be kept as truthful as possible, since I am meant to help developers and buyers/gamers.  Crest Review  To start this review off It is an Early Access game which is sitll in very heavy development. This game along with all other Early Access games in such an early stage such as Crest are not to be destroyed since they are going to be fully fleshed out in the future. Now to the review. (not so) Quick summary You are a god who commands a small group of people to do actions, for themselves to evolve and populate the island they roam. If you ever played godlike games like Black and White or Black and White 2, heck, even Godus, this is a brand new addition to the god genre. Instead of you, lets say, slaying animals or chopping down trees, you command your people to do all of that work for you. This is a very innovative method of just simply making rules using icons. There are only 3 icons in a sentence if you want to call them that. ""If ___ are ___ then ___"", the blanks are filled in by those pictures which then translate into telling your followers what to do. A great command to have is ""If I am unhappy, then I should gather food"" or you could swap out food with metal. You can even bring some awesome commands such as ""If I am a young follower, I should gather metal"" or ""if I am an old follower, I should go to the lions"". It's not guaranteed to work, but it's quite funny in my opinion over the range of things possible. Graphics and Artstyle Crest has a Polycraft like artstyle that make it look so pleasing to the eye, as if everything was carved out of a material, such perfect cuts to demonstrate that games can be good while looking beautiful all at once. I'm in love with this genre in terms of gaming and art, so it has an easy 7.5 on my rating so far. The graphics are very smooth and look interesting from different angles to give a unique playstyle. If that didn't make sense at all, I mean it can look 2D or 3D depending on the angle, or make a mountain look different from what it actually is, such as from a mountain to a house,  if you were to look at it from top down view. Realism Crest is actually pretty realistic for an Early Access game in terms of features. You give out commands, if those commands are not useful to your followers then they shall just carry on with their lives according to their needs so they will not die due to some stupid commandments such as ""If I am a young follower, I should not prioritize food/metals"". Also every single person has their own stats such as if you gave a commandment of finding food, ever person will have their own seperate stockpile of that item, same with ore, happiness, ect. That is what happened many times in different tribes long times ago and even now, you work for yourself,  if you fail, well, you fail for good. Realism is 9/10 already. I can only imagine how it will be like in the future. Pros vs Cons Pros:RealisticCheapFun and addictive is you know what to doBeautiful artstyleIn-depth gameVery promising for an Early Access gameConstant updatesSo many varieties of commandsCons:Nothing so far that's a con Finale Buy this game is you loved Black and White or even Godus! There is much to come. Final Rating 16.5/20 in my total rating - 75% on the happiness bar of gamesIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group  Check out the Original Network Groups.

								While it doesn't seem very proper to issue a review on a game so early in development, I think this game has some potential and I would advise a five dollar investment. In many ways it resembles populous, however the fundamental axiomatic structure of the game, in keeping with the more religious and anthropological aspects, is arbitrary. That is to say: ""the game"" is not simply about destroying an opponent but what *you find pleasing* for your tribe of people to do. This type of sandbox game is desperately needed these days; the five dollars is a worthy gamble in my estimation.			"

								This game is an interesting take on the God Game genre where instead of having direct control of your followers, you instead issue commandments that influence how your worshippers choose to live their lives. Sometimes they will thrive and flourish... other times they will starve to death because you told them food should not be touched. It's actually far more interesting to watch than to play but trust me, that's not a bad thing! It's actually really awesome to watch clouds pass over your island creating new forests with rains brought from the oceans and an overabundance of ran on an oasis can cause severe flooding that wipes your entire civilization out. It all feels... alive... despite being on a small scale with limited visual representation.

The main negative thing I notice about the game is once you've figured out what does what, the game can sort of drag down then again this is still very early access and the devs are pushing out updates at least once a week. All in all, I definitely recommend this game, not just for the small price tag, but because it's a God Game where you actually feel like a God who follows the ""laissez-faire"" approach to divinity!

								Okay. Where to begin?I suppose I'll kick this review off with a recap of my latest escapade in Crest.My game started as any other. My village situated under a mountain, in the midst of a river delta, and in the thick of the only forest on the entire isle. The numbers of lions and antelope were astonishing, a true gift from the gods. My people rejoiced and consumed grains from the earth and the flesh of the wild beasts that trekked across their hunting grounds. The wise guidance of their god revealed to them how to survive and thrive in this harsh environment.That was when the dancing began. With their huts full-to-bursting with the finest meats and plants, the Tribe became restless to procreate. Coital dance ceremonines followed, and a springtime baby-boom resulted. To fuel this extravaganza of conception, our tribesmen began to hunt the wildlife at an ever-growing pace. This greatly alarmed me; I hailed to them from the mountaintop, commanding them to steer clear of the antelope, and to only hunt lions (In order so that the lion population would still have food in the form of antelope).They didn't listen, much to my astonishment. They completely wrecked [shrekt] the antelope, with much help from the ravenous appetite of lions. After the depletion of that food source, they stuck to farming. Prides of lions encroached ever closer to the villages, stalking the youngest of the Tribe. this could not stand. I Divinely mandated my followers to be through with their feline agressors. That issue was resolved quick;y.By this time, my pious subjects had extended their reach across the island they called home. At one point the settlemetsn even numbered eight. The end, when it came, was swift and infuriating. The lag did us in. I, of course, had to piece together some role-play reason for this ignominious demise, and so I concoted this tale of 'lion-spirits' and evil 'antelope daimons'. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'll spare you the unnecessary boredom of a long list of pros and cons; I'll just make a short list of things I'd like implemented.-Buildings that you can indirectly cause your followers to construct; and example commandment might be [All in desert-I command you to-god], and that might cause them to, say, build a sacrificial altar to you.-More diversity in villages; they are quite generic.-More components for the commandments.-Balancing the non-follower ecosystem (I.E. making itso the lions don't eat ALL of the antelope by themselves).-More animals.-More actions that the villagers partake in, such as: fishing, swimming, worshipping, etc.			"

It now takes more thought as to not only try to balance your people, but also the ecosystem as a whole.			"

								Crest is a good game for people who just want a casual play. It takes a bit of a learning curve but once you understand what to do, it becomes quite nice. Basically all you do is give your people commands and that's it. To be honest, it would be nice if they added powers or miracles that you, as their god, could use. Such as the power to produce something or to sculpt the land. But then again, if they did that, it would be to similar to another game.I recommend this game for people who aren't interested in intence gameplay and who just want to relax.7/10, I would definitely give this game to my friends.

								Early Access review but in a nutshell: This is the game Godus should of been.While lack of goals may discourage some I find that it sits in the dwarf fortress mentality of ""Losing is fun"", its a story generator in a way such as how your followers mixed up your commandments and took up cannibalism or decided to feed all the old people to lions. Pros:- Nice consistent art style,- Calm soundtrack.- Interesting commandment mechanics system.- Well Structured tutorial, UI and options menu.Cons:- No Saving available at this time.- Not always clear what followers are doing.- Very slow paced and the large learning curve can put people off.- AI can be just rather derpy.See my first Impressions video below:

								This ""god-game"" is pretty bare at the moment as the only thing you can do is create commandments that tell your followers how to prioritize.  This is done by choosing symbols like ""desert"" or ""food"" and lining them up on a command bar.  What I would really like is for the game to tell me what the end result actually does as what you intended your followers to do many not actually be what they do.  The save function appears to be absent at present, though games tend to last maybe 15-30 minutes, if that.  I'd say if you want to support the devs then pick it up now...otherwise, wait for more content.  I like the ideas it conveys and will recommend the game for them alone, though I personally would have waited to see where it goes first before picking it up (had I not gotten a press copy).

								I honestly never really play simulators, but gave this one a shot. Quite enjoyable,unique and a different art style. It does seperate itself from other indies as well since it's base on religion. However, it's made to be ambiguous to produce a different story in every playthru. Don't go in expectating to simulate actual religions. If you're open minded, I would give it a try especial for it's price point.

Early Access Review
								[THIS IS A TEXT VERSION OF MY VIDEO REVIEW, VIDEO IS AT THE BOTTOM IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ BLOCKS OF TEXT]When i first booted this game up, within the first minute, a opinion couldn't be formed of how amazing this game was to me, it was only until i started a new game and went through the introduction of the game (Which in my opinion, does follow a more religious start of the world and how humans were created and such, and oceans, as well as you being a god, etc. (SIDENOTE: If anyone developing this game wants to correct me on this please leave a comment and i'll make a correction))But really, the game looks pretty good, something about it really just makes me go ""Wow, that looks amazing"", sure not everyone is gonna like it, fair enough, but it looks good to me, that's all that matters...to me...Gameplay, how does being a god work?Well after doing a 20 minute tutorial it seemed kind of...what's a nice way to put it...slow and really...was a lack of content, i will admit there are fast foward options avaliable (3 different speeds), but the game either feels too slow, or so fast that you can actually lose in under a MINUTE if you leave it on and do NOTHING. (To prove my point here's a clip of around 2 - 6 tribes dying in said time)So why do i say lack of content? Well i'm being more or less generous and that's fine in my opinion because this game is early access, so things will be added in the future. To get my point across, there simply wasn't enough for me to...review, so that can actually lead to problems, the most i could do in this game, is just write commandmentsI'm being serious, not to hate on the developers but that's the most, if not, the ONLY thing i can do in this game, period, for now.""So what are these...commandments?"" You may possibly ask, if you don't care about religions such as christianity.Basically you're making rules for your people, at the start of this video i showed you the most recent trailer i got thanks to one of the developers (Thanks again, Erik) emaling me about it.Now don't be fooled, you think this game is boring then, right? WRONG. This game actually doesn't make these people mindless drones, they actually have free will, which is actually amazing because this makes me feel it's like a civilisation game, but instead you can do nothing, the problem with that is like i said back at the fast fowarding part, if you do nothing, the people WILL die. And that's sort of a problem in my opinion, that they can't realize for themselves 100% of the time to reproduce and get food, i do question why they refuse to do this but i assume it's too keep the game player active and not just have the game open for 0 reason as a virtual tribe grows and expands.I'm giving credit to the developers here i don't see many games that allow the option of indepedance in npc's, so that actually makes it almost rare for me.The trailer, does it fully advertise what the game is showing at the time?In my opinion? It's a 50/50, i think it does, and doesn't, but that may be because i haven't played far enough into the game, the most i have in the game is...an hour, so i would understand if people couldn't take my review 100% seriously at this point, i wouldn't either""So why not play more of the game and review it?""It's a great question and i'm not denying it, but just believe me that i am a person that gets...bored quickly by doing lengthy things, this is the same problem i have for games such as civilisation V and Beyond earth, So i apologize to Erik for that, and i will play the game more as it gets updated.Back onto the point, does the trailer advertise what is in the game at the time? Yes. The only thing that makes me confused however is the starting point, especially the white lines on that guy with the sword, i must've seen it 20 times, and i didn't realize until JUST now, as i type this, those were stripes...wow i'm an idiot.But the game pretty much describes what i've seen in the game right now, though it probably shows more than what i've been able to see myself due to being lazy.My thoughts on the gameSo far i've been trying to be as positive as possible, i'm gonna be fully honest, when i was offered this game, and learnt it was based around religion, i was almost ready to turn it down, but i just decided that why just turn a game down because it has religion in it? Plus i never heard about it so may as well give it a try,And yeah, i found it to be enjoyable, i mean while i can't agree 100% with the whole religion idea, i will simply ignore that and play the game like it was intended, like you're playing as a god, of course i believe there are improvements to be made, for example the independance of people can end up to them dying because they can't understand they need food and to reproduce. And that the times of the commandments you're given don't really help much, i feel like the commandments should be more permanant and have the option to remove them, however this is an opinion and unless the majority agrees, i don't believe something as such could go into the game Final thoughtsOverall this game is aesthetically appeasing, gameplay wise it falls a bit but it's still enjoyable, if you're absoloutely against the idea of being a god and religion overall, then i personally recommend you don't get this game, otherwise you might have a bit of fun playing so.Video version:

Early Access Review
								Now I'm not usually one to be so brutally critical, but...'Early Access' is an understatement. This game is currently far from even playable. The game has such potential in its use of commandments and doctrines, but most of the time the player feels completely lost as they are faced with dozens of symbols and words which are given no explanation. Furthermore, the fact that you currently can't save a game is not really that much of an issue as the world you create as deity bears no resemblance to your will at all, as you constantly have to give mundane and obvious commandments such as 'If hungry, produce food', rather than anything cool or exciting. Towards the end of my second forray (the first time froze and I felt little inspiration to jump back in) I tried desperately to destroy the villages which had sprouted up of the own accord all over the small and flawed island (all the antelopes got stuck in one corner and a bit of the land was blue as if it was meant to be an ocean texture?) by giving them commandments such as 'If happy, start war'. I must admit it did give me some amount of joy to see the people rampage gleefully across the island murdering each other with smiles on their faces. All in all I would reiterate that the concept of this game has great potential, but sadly the execution is just way off, and rather than feeling like a powerful and guiding deity you feel more like a babysitter making aeroplane noises with a spoon in an effort to get the child to eat.

								Full Review here = ^-^ = : http://pewpewcat.com/crest-indie-game-review/Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play god? Even of just of a small area? Well Crest, the religion simulator may help you with that curiosity.In Crest, you are the god of a small village. In order to keep your villages alive and thriving, you give each area a command. Yet, they can choose to not listen to you. At first youcan tell them to produce food or to produce children. The things is, is not only do you have to make sure that they are well fed, but happy too. The thing is, is that some may be producing lots of food, however they become pretty unhappy if they don’t have kids. Also, when they have kids, they’re happy but could starve to death.On top of that, everything expands and you have to take care of multiple areas. Yet, there are some followers who will get disgruntled and leave. Thus they disobey your commands. In the end, the point of Crest is to make sure that you still have worshipers. When all your worshipers die, or no longer believe in you, it’s the end of the game.Crest is totally a different game than what I am used to. It’s a nice change of pace. As a god, you can send suggestions but you can’t force your followers to listen to you. Naturally, when you’re trying to be a good god, people are not always going to listen to you even when you know what’s best. Those ones ended up dying for me though.Either way, it’s totally an interesting game. So far, I have three different areas flourishing. Sure, there’s several dumb followers running around in the wilderness, thinking they know what’s best for themselves, but the rest of my followers are doing pretty well.			"

								The stylised graphics are actually really nice.  The point of the game is developing a society from a point where they can barely speak, so at first your commandments are a bit like a sledgehammer.  You gain finesse as a god by playing and earning new words.  Your followers are quite likely to make your nonsensical commandments even more nonsensical and then deciding that they don't like them very much, which is quite funny.  Babies seem to come from a time consuming and very tiring dance.  Have not tried upping the speed or causing war yet, but congrats on a really nice idea with charming chilled out music.Deserving of support			"

								I love the games art style, it is like looking at moving paper figures. the animations are very nice as well and they fit the theme.As for the gameplay: you make little lines with pictures to tell the people what to do. It took me a while to figure out I was writing some the wrong way around and after I changed that I got a little further. there is no save option yet but you don't really need it since a play is so short.I would not reccomend it for most people, but if you like the concept and want more you can help the developers update the game by buing it. you can read the blog and see how hard they are working on this game. I cant wait for the update that will come in the future. ( I will update my review from time to time if I can remember ;) )			"

								Between Dust and Godus, I’ve been disappointed a lot with god simulators over the last few years. But Crest didn’t feel like a waste of my attention. Yep, it’s a god-simulation, and yes, you’ve built your tribe up from a bunch of hut-dwelling-spear-throwing-toga-wearers before, but Crest a bit more than that too. It’s a game that presents you with a tools to overcome the challenges that come with raising a bunch of humans. And rather than commanding troops you take the role of spiritual advisor. This is interesting because leads to things acting in unexpected ways. Like sort of an evolution fish-tank. Of course, this is an Early Access game, and it's still a bit quirky. There are some show-stopping bugs that interfere with gameplay. But for five dollars if you're a fan of god sims the innovative elements of the game could draw you in and make this a great experience for you.			"

								Have you ever wanted to play as an ""Elf God"" in a game?  Me too, so I asked the developers if it was possible with this game.  Here's what I was wonderfully told...""Well, Vosoros. That's actually already possible, in a way. :)Let me explain, if you tell your followers not to kill all the animals or farm too much, or mine too much they will leave their environment in a balanced state. However, since the ecology system is a little bit wonky still it's not very easy to get a balanced state. We're addressing this in our upcoming module called the Exploration module, which we will start working on during the autumn.It's impossible to have a blanket statement that will tell them to live in balance, since that balance is relative to your island or your goals. We want to give you varied tools to make a balance you feel fits with the story you want to have.Also, in the upcoming module called Faith (that comes out this month) there will exist a doctrine where people will be inclined to preserve nature, they're simply called ""The Preservers"". You can try to educate your followers to follow this line of thought.""Enough said, I'm in love with this game now...			"

								I was pleasantly surprised. The Art Style is simple and unique, and's its not meant to be super realistic.The gameplay is simple and straight forward...but as you dive deeper it gets more complex with how you interact with your followers and what they are and aren't willing to do for you. I love simulation and strategy games, this appears to be a nice mix.I also made a commandment for the young followers to ""Detroy"" the old followers (Kill thy elders!)...and they did it...10/10 Would play again and recommend!

								It's a really great concept, and the art is really nice, too, but I had a lot of difficulty playing the game because as soon as you finish the tutorial, a lot of the followers decide on their free will and create other cities which makes it hard to monitor what's happening because of an influx of new things, and a limited view. I get a little dizzy having to turn the angles to properly see what's going on, and I'm hoping there's a way the menus get to organize the commandments? It reminds me a lot of the game Virtual Villagers. Although I thought the game would be different based on how the trailer looked, the gameplay itself was still interesting and I can't wait to see how Crest develops!			"

As is common with EA... not a lot of content.  -The commandment thing is novel, could turn out good (hope the code expands to showing the idea that certain string expands to mean), I'm sure new commandments will grow out of it and show more in the way of ""unlocking"".-Looking forward to more detailed status.

								Crest is a fun god simulator where you can issue commandments to your followers to aid their growth as a community. As they grow, their villagers will move and make new villages elswhere. Although you're only on one island and it will eventually be overcrowded or flooded, it seems to have plenty of room for a huge group of followers. The weather effects the island both positively and negatively, creating new water sources, droughts, floods, or forests all over the island.Each time you play your island will be a different one randomly generated for each new game. It seems smooth enough each playthrough.Pros: Plenty of Commandment variations, each with reward and consequenceLarge Island to play on filled with mysteries your followers will interact withAging system, so they will eventually die of old ageActive Developers improving the game with bigger ambitions to expand on it tooFun Fertility Rite dance you can find entertainment inYou're a god! What else could you want!?Cons: Currently no save featureThe island is large but will eventually be overpacked if you're ""too good"" at this gameThe followers seem to eat a lot so starvation is an ongoing problemBe careful with commandments, too many will cause confusion and they will only do one of themRain will often flood the lands near you causing farms to disappear or worse, villages flooded and everyone drownNot too many features currently, so not good for long term gameplayGraphics are not for everyone as they are cartoon/pixelated Overall Rating: 6.5/10			"

								I've got a sort of mixed opinion on this game. I understand that it's in early access so it's not really an accurate representation of what the finished game will be, but I do have a few issues with it. It's buggy and just.. I don't even know. Your followers never do what you tell them to so you lose the game within ten minutes and every time I've tried to save my game, it fails. I also think there should just be more for your people to do in general. It seems a bit bland that the only things they can really do is gather resources, make babies, and... That's it, really. I created commandments encouraging them to start war but it had no effect even if they liked the commandment. I also think that there should be a higher maximum of cities for each city-state than just five. The graphics could also stand to be touched up a bit – and yes, I realize that it's very stylized but I still think it could be better. Despite this, it's somewhat fun to play. It would be a lot better if the people actually did what they were told (though I realize that if they don't always do what they're told, it creates a challenge, blah blah blah). The tutorial was also a bit unclear..? It took me a few tries to figure out what exactly they wanted me to do (but that could just be my own genuine stupidity). There's lots of room for improvement and I'm eager to see where the developers decide to take this game.			"

								Right now I cannot recommend this game as there is so little in it that it's barely a game at all.Also, there are very little information about how to make your people survive. The tutorial does not give enough examples of commands and what they can do. Especially the middle commands, I always wondered what's the difference between the top ones and the middle ones, they sound so similar.A bit more clarity and a thorough tutorial with many examples would help.In the game, there is little to do, you give you commands and sit back to see your subject die one after the other. I was able to keep a game running for 30 min +, all I saw was the same thing as when I launch my new game. There was no evolution, the people were as stupid and primitive (and buggy) as before. There was one lady with a baby that was running in circles near the central building, I guess they need to revise their pathfinding engine.Also, what's the goal here? I see no goal, no point in playing this game at al. I do not see any evolution, no goals or objectives, nothing. Quite boring. It would be in the Dev's best interest to make the people evolve, otherwise I'll go back to my populous games that dates over 20 years and are much much better.Do not buy, don't waste your money. At least until this is a full game, now it's just an empty shell. I might recommend it once it is finished, but if it remains more or less like it is right now, I'll put this game in my garbage folder in my library and never touch it again!EDIT 1: After trying out the game several times, I have noticed that it makes you lose automatically after 15 to 30 min as if that was coded in the game. Like the devs added a line of code that tells the game that the player should lose after 15 to 30 min. Also, there are no goals in the game. You just do ""commandments"" which are extremely vague and the tutorial is not even close to helping you know what they do.I still don't recommend this game/sim, it's boring, bland, graphically impaired (even if this game was nice, the graphics wouldn't be important), goaless and extremely difficult to know what to do plus almost nothing to help you out on how and what to do to Progress in the game.There are no tech levels in the game. The people remain a bunch of primitive dumdums, sometimes become a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I guess the goal is to have the dumbest people possible. lolStay away from this game, it's not even worth 1$ right now. Wait at least a year before doing anything, trust me!			"

								Curator Review:Developed and published by indie game developer Eat Create Sleep, Crest is a God Game for PC on Steam Early Access that takes place in the early stages of Humanity. Give your followers commandments in the form of symbols and watch them misinterpret every last word and then go to war over it. While ultimately the game sounds like a great deal of fun, I find there is not a great deal to actually do in the entirety of the game. Watch the AI do it's AI thing, put down a couple of basic commandments here and there, and Humanity will thrive endlessly. The lack of depth and lack of content for the player to mess around with ultimately gives Crest a 6/10

								Crest is a game where you are a god and you are trying to guide your followers through the hardships of their world and have them survive as long as possible.  you can save and quit but there is no manual saving and loading (again the goal is to make your guys survive as long as possible). The main twist of the game is you do not give direct orders to them but you give them commandments and depending on what they need they may or not follow them. They also may add their own addendums to your commandments or may completely disregard them. The game is in early access so there is not a ton of content right now. You have your basic need (food, procreate, materials) you can migrate and build more cities and interact with the fauna (lions and antelopes). There are other things coming like economy or ideology. Game seems stable enough (i did crash but only once and that may have been on my end). I could see people spending a few hours even at this state and be satisfied with the game especially at its price (which is kinda cheap).

								Honestly was more frustrating than interesting, you can do very little, Black and White is a much more interactive godsim. I assumed this would have a little less interactivity but the player themselves has very little impact whatsoever.			"

								This is... definitely not off to a good start.First, please, by God, hire an artist.  A game like this needs good art; there's precious little going on, and the concept doesn't allow for much else.Second, explain the commandment system.  I have no clue what is going on.  In fact, rewrite the commandment system from scratch.Redo the graphics.Redo this game.  The concept was so good...			"

								Okay, I guess. Not very fun at this point. Not sure what commands do what- so it's kinda confusing. Gets VERY laggy on higher speeds after there are more than 5 villages. I was interesting but I probably won't play again.			"

								i thought the development would progress but this game is just horrible, the graphics, textures are bad, the game play is boring and the gameplay is super limited. it looks like a 4 year old made it. only played it for abit because the graphics make me want to hurl everywere.unless the whole game is redesigned i probably wont ever install it again.not recommended.

								An interesting take on god-genre games.I really don't know how to explain it.Well, I guess I could have an overview of it, and have a pros and cons list, because that's what every review does, right?So, Crest is a game where you create commandments that no one follows (or atleast very few do it, but it takes them years to figure out what the commandments mean), and then you watch them dance around. That's about it. Still has more to do in it than atleast half of all other early access games. xDPros:+You get a new world every time you start a new game, instead of having the same island every single time.+If your followers happen to follow your commandments, you can build a pretty nice society, with lots of people (I'm guessing. I've never gotten that far. xD).+Besides being really blocky, things actually look like how they would in real life.Cons:-Followers rarely follow your commandments (or atleast it takes them years to even just start).-Even though it's an early access game, I don't think that I can't point out how blocky everything is. TBH, I'd rather have Minecraft's graphics.-Making commandments can be VERY confusing. I don't think I have to explain.But, overall, I guess it's OK. Buying the game I guess would help with updating it, and making it better.			"

								I had one settlement in the middle of an island. Half the island was just desert, but the main settlement was in a savannah near two rivers and jungle. This settlement was very successful, constantly having children yet never running out of food. It was completely surrounded by farms. Soon new settlements started popping up, but they always appeared in the desert. These new settlements were good at only one thing.Starving to deathI've gone through probably five other settlements in fifteen minutes, while the main one still thrives.4/5 Still needs work, but it isn't too bad as an earlym access.

								If you like god games BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW. This game succedes where others have failed by creating a great and simple system to control your world with: instead of controlling the world itself like other games (changing the water level, or affecting the landscape), you create ''commandements'' that dictate how your people react to what's around them and in what way they react to them, which can be anything from telling them that people about to die shouldn't eat food since they're going to be wasting ressources, to creating commandements just for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles like telling unhappy people to kill happy people and basicaly creating the purge. This game is VERY active and it's developpers are still working on it. please support them, they deserve it. If I could think of anything that would increase my fun in this game than I am right now, it would be to add more identification symbols. Tribes ands or cities identify themselfs with flags and each flag has a symbol, but I think they're all independant and somtimes the same flag/symbol will appear multiple times per map creating a confusing situation where you're not fully certain weither or not they're part of the same nation or if they're just seperate parties under the same flag. Another awesome thing to add would be to make a way for commandements to affect specific things such as animals and maybe even plant life instead of just people (ex: lions consume antelopes, trees grow more on desert, etc). Other than features though, the ai has a few problems with pathing and logistics, many times a game has ended not because my people, but because they were stuck perpetualy moving in circles or endlessly trying to break down buildings all the while, for some incomprehensible reason, not dying off from hunger or lack of ressources. Also, from time to time, followers tend to ignore the commandements given to them like me telling them to move to a different biome only for them to decide to NOT do that and just keep killing each other. All in all though, this game DESERVES to be worked on and its devs deserve some praise. This game has great potential, and like I said, it succedes where others have failed (i.e, Godus). 11/10, can't wait for the next update.			"

								Followers in desert, consume old people.I should never be left in charge of people ever. In fact, I should probably be in a padded room in a hug-me jacket.8/10: I don't like being reminded that I should be in a hug-me jacket.			"

								Crest is an interesting game that feels more realistic than many other god games. The way the people are able to interpret your will differently than what you want is quite amusing to watch and frustrating at time. However I still say that it is a great experience overall.Here is a video I did on the game:
