												An asteroid hurdles through space, speeding past alien spacecraft who follow it, attempting to scan it for any life. Within seconds, the asteroid is out of sight, and enters the orbit of a planet. Catching fire, it slams into the ground, creating a crater from the impact. Hundreds of small fragments explode from the asteroid, scattering themselves around the planet. Some land by cities of sophisticated, lizard-like beigns, others by curious tribes who begin worshipping the fiery rocks, and by clueless creatures who poke and lick them. One particular fragment lands in a small pool of water, and you crawl out - a small, slithery cell who's main goal is to survive. This is Spore, the tale of how your microscopic race can go from scavengers getting enough food to barely survive, to a thriving empire that controls the entire galaxy. The game is based on five stages: Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, and Space. Cell station is where your journey begins. There is little customization in this stage, except for the basic shape of your cell and organelles. Once you become the top of the food chain, you evolve legs. Stumbling onto land, you enter the Creature Stage. Here is where the true customization takes place. You can collect various parts from skeletons scattered around the planet and add them to your creature. You can make a huge, strong behemoth who crushes his enemies with his gigantic claws, or a small, nimble beign that flies and steals food from his enemies before they notice he is there. You can create your creature based on your species' diet: omnivore, carnivore, or herbivore. Besides the customization, Creature Stage introduces a huge skill in the game that is incredibly useful - friends and foes. You can choose whether to impress other races and become friends, or attempt to destroy and annhilate them. You have to be wise as to who you attack and who you ally; making enemies with all the weak creatures could end up with them evolving into way stronger creatures and destroying YOU. Once your brain has increased, your species can begin laying out the foundations for a tribe. Here is where the friends and foes system comes into major effect. To complete the Tribal Stage and become a civilization, you must complete your Tribe Totem Pole. For every tribe you defeat or ally, a new totem is added. This stage goes by rather fast, and prepares you for Civilizational Stage. Civilization Stage takes inspiration from Sid Meier's Civilization series. Your goal is to control every city on the planet, whether through religious, economic, or military means. Religious races can convert the race into believing your civilization is their leader, and is considered the easiest way to complete the stage. Military is just brute force; when it comes to the guns in this, size DOES matter. Economic is peaceful; you start a trade route with a friendly city and eventually buy their city from them. This takes longer than the other two ways but can be very helpful in the long run.Once you control the planet, you can launch a space project, starting the Space Stage, which is endless. All the choices you've made in the previous stages add up to decide what class you are in the Space Stage - perhaps a battle-crazed tyrant, or a religious zealot out to convert everyone to the teachings of Spode. During the stage, your goal is to go from the Captain of your Space Project to the Omnipotent Beign of the Universe. On the way, you'll encounter the Grox - a cyborg race who hate all and arguably are the antagonists of the game. (If hours of work are put into it, you could make them your ally- if you ever do, I commend you for your bravery.) Between space pirates, colonizing other planets, upgrading your fleet, and stabalizing your funds, this is by far my favorite stage. Overall, this is a great game for creative people and truly lets your imagination soar.Graphics: 16/20Story: 17/20Gameplay: 20/20Replayability: 19/20Soundtrack: 18/20Overall: 90/100			"

												I didn't build my empire, I took it. Tearing it from the grasp of the species around me. What I couldn't buy with money I bought with the blood of the innocent. My empire was pure; only the clean survived. My empire was strong; I sifted the weak away like chaff. My empire was vast; we spread our might to the farthest corners of the galaxy.We were a people of pure war. Gunfire was our music, the smell of smoke and charred flesh was the sweetest of aromas, and the site of corpses and ruins was the most beautiful sight there was. The universe was our canvas and we painted it with blood. Death was our peace and destruction was our prosperity. We made petty alliances with the other, impure species in the galaxy. We used them to do our bidding. The smiled as they went to their deaths. Then while they were busy, we claimed what was rightfully ours. We tore down their homes and slaughtered their people. It was but mere amusment to the wars we had seen. Just something to pass the time.Others we waisted no time with. They were too unclean to be bothered with. They were dirt and we were to clean the universe. We were to scrub their impurity out of the fabric of space and time. Some species fought back, their fights were mightier than others, but still nothing compared to our vast power.Soon we met the grox, a mighty empire that had claimed the center of the universe. The center of a universe that belonged to us. We waged war. And we do to this day... but that is what we want. After all this time, we met an empire that would wage war on us eternally. And so, our galactic history turned into a galactic love story. A story of two empire who have fallen in love with the war they wage on each other.10/10 Will recomend to the corpses of my enemies.

												wow, it's been 9 years since i started playing this game. This was probably the game that actually got me into gaming. It has great mechanics, outstanding creative abilities, and doesn't take up too much space on your hard drive. interesting how it changes from a top-down scroller, to a third person rpg/adventure game, then to a stratergy game, then 3rd person space explorer. there's something in it for everyone. only thing that has aged is the graphics, quite outdated and not updated, but the pros overwhelm the cons. great game.

												Pretty good fun game but unless it's on sale or you have a coupon it's not really worth the full price. People have trouble with the game left and right. You need to fix two registry errors just upon start up. Your world might freeze during gameplay and force you to start over on another world. Your key for the game may not work and the multiplayer servers don't work.No, you will not get a refund, it's not Steam's fault. It's Maxis and EA's but you won't get a refund from them either and no the game will not be patched so don't bother whining about that. People are buying the game regardless if they patch it, they have no reason to spend extra money to fix it.			"

												First off, my hours spent playing this game do NOT represent my true hours in this game. I've probably got thousands of hours in since release.I did however, recently come back to it after perhaps a year off.Went from cell stage all the way to space stage. Conquered a few systems, allied with a few more. Played God on a few others.Advanced to the center of the galaxy, and annoyed one of my previous stages in that area. Proceeded to go to war with them... completely forgetting that I waged war with, and defeated the Grox with that Empire.Naturally, I got absolutely obliterated.10/10, would lose a war with myself again.

												Bought the complete pack.Started 3 worlds.HerbivoreCarnivoreOmnivoreHerbivore: Easy! Because in the beginning theres food LITTERALLY EVERYWHERE. On land even more! And a whole tribe collects ''Apples'' Even more!Carnivore: Sometimes tricky, because when you are low on food you HAVE to kill a animal, even on low health.But in the tribe stage they all go after fish, and meat. WAAAY easier. And dont be scared in the civ stage. BECAUSE BLOOD AND GLORY!!!Omnivore:Hardest, but also easiest. Food, EVERYWHERE. All the food is accepted. But in the civ stage, Its hard to start off. First of all, Get money to make allies, start a trading route, and then, BOOM Money flows in. Buy the city, But then, Other nations attack. I can place turrets, but against a team of 7 ''Tanks'' You cant win. So i thought, If i give that city to them, then i can make a trading route with them, and buy off their city's!. Worked! after buying 7 cities, they said: Want to work together? And then, Space.I would love a medival or pirate age. Sounds cool.11/10 Would play it as a omnivore again.			"

												Spore is a game I have played many times over the years. From the cell stage through to the space age, it keeps being fun. It is cute, appropriate for young children, can be challenging if played on harder difficulty settings, and offers you a literal galaxy's worth of content. I once spent over a year playing this game frequenly and barely put a dent in my expansion of the Universe. Making every planet mine, and every world a Tier 3 world was my dream, and the universe is so large, I don't think one person alone can do it, but it sure was fun to try. The addon content, Galactic Adventures as well as Creepy and Cute add more dimension and choice to the game, as well as some new content. One of the most exciting things about Spore is that you can create your own species at every stage, and shape them into whatever or whoever you want them to be.			"

												This game is providing me with what I have always dreamed of. ABSOLUTE POWER OVER THE ENTIRE GALAXY! if I play my cards right. Every stage of this game is good fun. I abolutely love this game.My only complaint is that in the final stage of the game your empire becomes soo large that personally dealing with every little thing and trying to handle the spice trading for your entire empire with your one player controlled ship really started sucking. I wanted to be able to Age of Empires style delagate responsibilities to computer controlled characters. like trading, like military action, like colonization. I wanted to end up being the emperor who could just watch the empire I had built continue to grow, and spread, and take everything over everything. After the setup and planning you do in the first stages of the game, only require minimal player interaction, which would leave me (the emperor) the freedom to go do whatever I wanted. (like finding galactic adventures and lvling my captain. that was fun.) That said, this game is fun and totally worth the cost. Its just not made to allow you to be able take over the galaxy to the scale that I had wanted, in other words its sort of soft-capped out. There comes a point when you reach a size where you simply cannot manage everything personally, and you start losing planets as fast as you are gaining them.			"

Posted: May 25, 2015
												I am extremely happy to own this game on Steam.I probably spent hundreds of hours playing this game throughout all of it's stages.Spore is a rather complex game even if it comes off as a bit childish.It has 5 completely different game stages:In the first one you start as a cell trying to survive.As you progress,you start to evolve into a multicellular organism,develpoing more and more features like better eyes,horns and so on.In the end your ''fish'' will evolve enough for it to go on land.This is where the second stage of the game begins.You are now a land animal fighting/socialising with other species and exploring the world.Same as in the first stage you evolve continuously.The Third stage,is the tribal stage.Your animal is smart enough to form a tribe,craft tools,build houses and create a form of government.Your mission is to conquer the surrounding area by war or diplomacy.After that,the fourth stage begins.Now you must conquer the entire planet by the same principle.But now along war and diplomacy,you can establish your domination by trade.This stage represents the stage we are in.Tanks,nuclear bombs and lots of trading.Now begins the space age.You now control the entire solar system and begin exploring the Milky Way galaxy.This is by far the best stage of the game because of it's depth.It is for sure addictive to explore planets and venture into the unknown meeting space empires,undeveloped planets and so on.You can terraform planets,blow them up,colonise them or just explore for artifacts and more hidden items.The game is fun but it has it's weak points.It could have been so much more.The tribe and industrial age stages are dull and unremarkable.They play as RTS games with a bit of diplomacy mixed in there.Nothing special and it could have been much improved.This game is a unique sandbox space exploration simulator and my only regret is that Maxis limited themselves when creating this game.It could have been one of the best games of the 2000's..let's hope they plan a Spore 2.The seemingly unlimited customization combined with tons of free user created content gives the game amazing replay-ability.I recommend this game to everyone.At least to try it once.

Posted: December 24, 2016
												I wish everyone a merry Christmas, but that´s not the full purpose of this review.I discovered SPORE in 2012, more than 4 years ago and I can still enjoy it like I did then. This game isn´t only one of my all-time favourites, but my secondly most played game of all time as well. As you can see on my playtime, SPORE is absolutely massive and I don´t regret any minute I spent on it, not even those 2,880+ I had already collected on Origin. I am thankful this is now also available on Steam, but unfortunately EA games are simply not made to be here, EA doesn´t give a **** to their Steam-community.Whom do I recommend SPORE to? (All following aspects are listed in order of importance)Explorers: First spot, definately. If you love to spend your time on uncovering secrets, this game is perfect. Especially the last stage has tons of things waiting to be discovered by YOU. If you aren´t an explorer, don´t be afraid, this one is OPTIONAL, you can ""complete"" SPORE without finding all secrets as well.Creative: Very close to the previous type. The designers feature nearly INFINITE possibilities. There´s almost nothing you can´t create, your imagination is the only limit. More than 400 Creature-, 500 Vehicle- and 600 Building-parts to use, modifacation of those and no set placements allow an unbelievable ammount of possible combinations. In fact there is no object looking like another one.""God-wannabes"": Write your own story from the very beginning. Start as nothing but a little cell, the most simple lifeform, evolve to an intelligent group leader and rise to the lord af the largest empire in the entire universe. Mess-Around: Everything said. Build ugly monsters and use them to kill everybody, edit the surface of planets, transform water into lava, highjack your friends, wipe out innocent creatures... The only limit is your free time :DChallengers: Who said this game was going to be easy to finish? In fact it´s impossible, the last stage is endless... And trust me, if there´s one thing you have to try to understand, it´s (Spoilers Ahead) reaching the galactic core and wiping out the Grox... I wish you fun at exterminating around 2000 star systems...Children: I know this has a teen-rating, but seriously, nobody would be mad about a six-year old playing this. Of course you can literally take out the entire universe without showing mercy, but the brutality is way to low to be frightening to anyone... Come on, the animation isn´t even realistic...Non-EA-haters: I am afraid, but that´s the point I have to admit. The only thing I dislike this game for, but only the Steam version. EA doesn´t let Steam-users connect to their servers, so all online-features are disables for us. Bad thing that you can´t share your creatures or download other´s epic content, but this review won´t change either. EA isn´t ready for Steam yet and won´t ever be. I think singleplayer fun can annihulate this point, but the condition is bad, that´s sure.Do I recommend Spore to anyone else? I am not sure about this one, to be honest. This might be considered too kid-friendly for some adults and too boring for action-gamers. This review is intended to be funny, just as SPORE is. In fact I want to say that you shouldn´t miss this, SPORE is just a game everyone should at least know. Please, get it in a sale. I do not force you to play this for as long as I did. Since there are no achievements you can also get rid of this within a daytime. I am still really surprised by this, SPORE just marked the simulator-genre, it´s still the one and only god simulator. I know there aren´t even many, but those few won´t ever reach this. Why do I say ""get it in a sale"" when it seems like I am amazed enough to pay it fully?Because I didn´t either. Spore without online support isn´t just worth it. Get the Origin version if you don´t mind. saving your progress for this is important and sharing creations keeps the community alive. SPORE is an amazing game, but the publisher isn´t a great one. Thanks a lot for reading until here, it means a lot to me. I'd aprechiate if you leave a rating, I care about your opinion. Keep it up, guys ;)			"

												Ive known about this game before it came out when i was younger, And i still love the hell out of it today. Hands down one of my favorite games, But this little gem has its flaws and its perfections.Spore, i can easily say is one of those games which you can let your imagination run wild, make whatever you like, And isnt too complex. So its easy to pick up and learn. Plus the main game, besides the Creature/Building/Vehicle creator, Is pretty fun too; evolving from a simple cell, into a complex creature, then into a tribe, into a nation, and lastly, into a vast empire in space. The replay value of this game can be high, Depends how much you liked the game.Now as for its flaws... The game has its bug, sure all games have their bugs. But Spore has had some unusual ones. Before i had the game on steam, I owned up to three copies of spore. All stopped working after some time. Each one having a strange error prior to just dying, The last copy i had affected Space Stage, Every Empire, Planet, Solar System, and Galactic Formation were all named 'BADDATA'. Now does this affect the steam version of Spore? I dunno, hasnt happened yet and i dont see anyone else complaining about it. As for some problems that i see with Spore on steam; The game does crash often, and with almost all games that crash often, The game isnt good with autosaves, And if im correct only saves once you get to the next stage. So this can easily set you really far back in Space stage, Sometimes making it not too fun to play. Plus there is the price. The game is kinda dated, and has some problems, So it isnt worth the $20.So if its on sale, Go buy this game, im sure it will be an experience.Now if its not on sale, Get something that you may want instead, unless you really want Spore. then get Spore.

												If ever there was a game that divided opinion, Spore is it! While i can see why it frustrated a lot of people by taking the relatively cutesy path rather than being a genuine look into genetically creating different creatures, it still gives you a huge amount of options when it comes to making your own creations. The second level is where you really get to flex your creativity and is without doubt the best level in the game. It does rather tail off as you get further into it, especially the fifth stage (space travel), but when you feel like a break from the missions themselves, you can simply head back into the creature creation section and create an entire planet's worth of creatures. If you should find this at a sale price, i would recommend it then, but at full price... maybe not.			"

Overall score- 7/10Pros- You can get very creative- You can make the game more challenging - The game is customizable in the way that you can select you type of gameplay, for example a friendly and smart spieces, or a ferocious and aggresive one.Cons- The game runs kind of ugly if you dont have a good gaming computer- May get repetitive for some people			"

												It's a great game. But $20 is a little bit pushing it.Well, there are tons of sales, and as I'm writing this there's one right now, so you might want to wait for one.Gameplay:Evolving your creature is something I found super fun. The graphics are really nice and the animals are cute....most of the time...I also love the feature that your behavior effects your reputation as a species, you might be a vicious killer, or a very social creature that likes friends.Unfortunatly, personally I find the extreme change of gamplay a little boring. It starts off as you evolving, killing or befriending other creatures, and eating them or plants. Then it locks the way you look and that's kind of sad, transforming it into a full on tactical birds-eye view of your planet, defending off enemies, and eventually going into..space?So I see what to developers were doing, a little cell in the ocean to advanced beings in space, but it just didn't seem all that interesting to me at that point.Depending on what you like, it has an ok replayibility level, but I like going into create and making my own cool animals.

												Spore has left me with very mixed emotions.  I LOVE going through the Cell stage and then playing through the Creature stage (4.5 out of 5 stars to that point).  The first night I downloaded the game, I had planned to only play a half hour or so before bed, which turned into 3+ hours and having to be harrassed by my husband to finally shut down the notebook.  I was starting to become an addict already!And then the Tribal phase happened.There is a very natural flow between the Cell and Creature stages, with a little more complexity added when you begin to move the camera around.  The game is entirely at your own pace and you aren't penalized for taking your time to explore, look for additional parts, or make more friends.  It's truly a casual game.  And then Tribal turns the game entirely into a Tower Defense game where you have to control multiple units and every minute you spend trying to build a strategy is held against you as the other tribes start to hate you more, attack your village, and steal your food.  To add to the fun, the interface is confusing and unintuitive.  At that point, the game fell to 3 out of 5.I've made it through Tribal once and into the City/Civilization stage.  And that is as far as I'll ever go in this game.  The Cell and Creature stages have lots of replayability, which is why I can still recommend the game despite my obvious dislike of the rest of the stages.  I bought this game when it was on sale so I feel like it was a pretty good buy for the parts I enjoy. "

												SPORE is a very old game. It's very unique, friendly, and (against a lot of other opinions) executed very well. I remember pre-ordering the physical copy of the game as a kid. The first time I booted the game up was just mind blowing. An entire galaxy that's mine to control! I didn't care what others thought, it let my imagination run wild and showed me hundreds of hours of entertainment.Spore is a game about imagination where the limits just keep expanding. As you progress through the game you'll be able to control a creature that you have thrown together, through the stages of evolution. Work hard to get your cell onto land. Dominate the other creatures with friendship or extinction. Take control of your tribe's continent. Unify the world's civilizations. Take control of the galaxy, one solar system at a time, and discover it's secrets. All of this can be done in a game of SPORE.Feeling really creative? Make some friends and share your creations with eachother! To really put your creations to use, consider visiting the DLC store pages! You won't regret the extra hours and hours of gameplay, created by the community!			"

												It's fun at first, but it lacks replayability.The cell stage is mildly entertaining while you decide what kind of life-form you want to grow up to be (though I guarantee you'll pick Omnivore if you can help it).While it's a matter of survival in your animal form, the game really feels fresh and new. In fact, I would've liked it more if the animal stage was a lot longer. The way you interact with other animals, the way you take on larger creatures or even epic monsters, the migration patterns of your herd and exploring the wide world is really fun and really engaging.But after the animal stage, the game becomes a very basic, very lackluster real-time strategy game. The tribal and civilization stages are nothing more than mash-ups of Age of Empires and Civilization, the only bonus being that you get to design your stuff. There's nothing here that you haven't seen before, from three-choice politics to point-and-click control of armies comprised entirely of a single land vehicle type, which you will no doubt convert to a fleet made entirely of aircraft due to them not being limited as to where they can travel.But the biggest letdown was the space stage. Instead of starting at one vessel and working your way to commanding a whole fleet with which to explore and conquer as you see fit, you're stuck with a single ship occassionally accompanied by a few brainless AI ships who are utterly useless against the more powerful space empires and tend to die pretty quickly. Oh, sure, you can upgrade that one ship, but there's no real sense of progress being made.The graphics aren't that great, with everything looking about as well polished as that old CG television show Reboot, just with improved animation. If the textures and shapes were a bit more complex it might stand out.I'd recommend this game only if it's on sale or free for a weekend, because it really isn't worth paying full price for this. It has enough juice for about 1 playthrough, but afterwards I really can't see any reason to go 'round again except to make different choices that will ultimately lead to the same result. But if you take the path of least resistance, you'll end up making the same choices each time.Ultimately, it's a good concept, but the mid-to-late game mechanics really feel uninspired, like too much focus was given to aesthetic customization options rather than gameplay mechanics.

												Spore is a fantastic game, whether I'm playing the full game from cell to space, or just creating a fantastic creature with my 5 year old niece. Spore is both user-friendly and appropriate for all ages and I would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.There is only one thing I would change about this game, and this is a feature that only I am likely to care about. I want it to be possible to type more for the descriptions of the creatures and their vehicles and I want it to be possible to type descriptions for individual cities on their planets. I like to create a lot of backstory for the creatures and vehicles in my game because I want to tether the game to reality. In an effort to do this I've taken to documenting the various wars, city foundings, vehicle creations race extinctions etc. on a piece of paper. I set a timer on my phone to keep track of the ""years"" that have passed in the game and keep a detailed log of my civilization's history every 5 ""years"" from start to finish. It would be easier if I could record more info for each creature and for each city on every planet, it'd certainly save my wrist from arthritis later in life.  "

I've spent more time than is reasonable, and was rather obsesseded actually. I DO however, remember being devoured by giant monstrosities, befriending others, and conquering the universe.  ""Ok, gotta put those eyes over there.. Maybe this should be a Cyclops! No.. Perhaps a tail hat! Definitely a mustache, oh yes. And a nose ring."" Just one of the many things I remember thinking.  This game is truly huge. It has so many aspects, that I've replayed it more times than I can count and am still thoroughly enjoying myself. If you have even the faintest creative spark in you, this game is for you.  Please Note: This was released in 2008. It's not going to have the best graphics, or anything like that. It just makes it even more impressive that this kind of game was developed and released that long ago.			"

												It's fantastic being able to design and play as your own creatures.  The design possibilities are nearly limitless.  Creating and messing around briefly as your creatures is really the only great part about this game.  The Cell, Tribal, Civ, and Space stages are mostly just disappointing and tedious.  If you have a day free, you can play all the way from Cell stage to Space stage in a single sitting.  Space is agreeably the worst part of the game sense you are set as a single ship managing your entire empire. (And no expansion fixes that)  I'm pretty upset that they gave up on this franchise.  I feel like it could have easily become amazing and complex over generations like the Sims franchise. TL:DR Only get this game when it's on sale.			"

												This game is impeccable. The space stage is very fun, and it is a sandbox, which i really like. Although once you are Omnipotent, there is not much else you can do other than go to war, ally with other aliens and spread your colony throughout the galaxy. I played the space age for about 48 hours before i got a bit bored, and right now i am allying with the big bad meanie beanie who are the grox. I have always been looking for a game in which you evolve, but not an extremely serious one, this has multiple fun stages for you to enjoy, and many achievements for you to collect. The cell stage is like agar.io and one of the LEAST fun ones because it is so short (I can do it in 5 minutes without a particular rush) and then you grow legulars and go onto the creature stage (the least fun in my opinion, but for many it is a favourite. Tribal stage, oh tribal stage. I find it very fun! I just go around befriending other tribes :) Civilisation stage is one of the funnest. I like being religious and converting everyone :3 then space!! It actually does have a main goal and that is to go to the centre of the galaxy, which i found quite a challenge but when i did it it was so worth it for you get a very useful tool :3 10/10 would evolve again.

												Spore is a great game. I've been playing for over 24 hours now in total across Spore and Spore: Galactic Adventures. You start off as a cell, evolve into higher level species and eventually become a spacefaring civilization. I've learned a few different things about the game that I feel newer players could have use of knowing.Evolve your creature to max in the creature stage if you plan on playing with Galactic Adventures. You will be using creature stage abilities a lot here, better make sure that it becomes as easy as possible for you.Save often. Spore crashes occasionally, and with the immersiveness of the game, it's easy to forget to save. Spore does NOT have auto-save functionality.One more thing that a lot of people miss: BACK UP YOUR SPORE DATA FOLDERS! I had the game suddenly delete all my progress in Spore without any warning. I don't know the programming logic that would result in such a thing happening, but when I launched Spore yesterday, I was greeted with the main menu with no saves in it. Luckily I already had an older backup of the data as I copied it for playing on another computer once, but I've lost a lot of progress.Spore data folders may be found at %appdata%\Spore as well as ""My Spore Creatures"" in your Documents folder. Back them up regularly.			"

												Spore is by far one of the best sandbox evolution based survival games I've played. Given that I haven't heard of any other games that pursue this kind of playstyle, my review may be slightly biased. You will start off as a single cell that has been brought to your planet by a meteorite. You can choose between playing as a carnivore or an herbivore. In the first stage (Cell) the carnivore is argueably the better choice because there will be plenty of creatures to eat, and you get parts to add to your cell faster this way. The currency in this stage is DNA points, which can be gained by eating plants (herbivore) or meat (carnivore). Once you have filled the progress bar to full, you will advance to the creature stage. In this stage, your cell evolved into a creature and migrates onto land with a group of your species. You are able to add legs and arms in this stage, and can add a filter mouth or jaw in order to make your species into an omnivore. I highly recommend this because you are not stuck with being forced to find animals to kill or migrate to find more fruit to eat. The currency in this stage is the same as the currency in the cell stage, however is gained by allying groups or destroying them. Once you have finished the creature stage through defeating or allying other groups of animals, you will transition to the tribal stage! In this stage you band together with your group and make alliances with other tribes or exterminate them. There is a wide array of tools available to choose from in this stage, from fishing spears, to stone axes, to healing rods. All of them serve various functions and your main currency to purchase these buildings is food. Which can either be gathered from the wild or plundered from enemy villages. Once you have finished the tribal stage, you will advance to the civilization stage! In this stage, the tribes you either destroyed or allied will band together to form your first city! You get to design a lot in this stage. The town hall, factories, houses, entertainment, boats, cars, airplanes! It's all at your fingertips! The main currency in this stage is called Sporebucks. This is earned by selling spice, the hot commodity in spore, which is produced by geysers on your planet. Eventually, other groups of your species will arise with their own cities. You can either choose to ally them, purchase their city through economic means, convert their city through religious means, or force their city into submission through military means. How you played each stage determines which kinds of special abilities that you have. In the civilization stage, the way you played the tribal stage determines whether you are a militant or religious city. How you caputure an enemy city determines its specialization. Or for instance you capture a military city by religious means, you can choose whether it is a military city or a religious city. Once you have achieved total global domination, you will advance to the space stage! Most people dislike the space stage because it's ""boring"" or ""too different from previous stages"". I think it is the most fun stage because you can purchase star systems, plant colonies, craft planets to your liking, discover other empires, destroy lesser empires, uplift a species in a lower stage to a higher one, terraform planets that were 150 degrees Celsious to a comfortable 22 degrees, control the spice empire through taking ownership of the high profit spice planets, defeat the evil Grox empire guarding the center of the galaxy, and so much more! People dislike it because it takes so long, but that's the fun of it. You are but a single planet in a galaxy of tens of thousands! Have fun, explore! They've even included the Solar System for you to find (I've found it)! After playing this game for over a week now, I've expanded my empire to a measly 30ish systems. I look forward to conquering the Grox and expanding my fruitful empire to the farthest reaches of the galaxy.tl;dr A great game with tons of customization as you expand from a cell to a galactic superpower.10/10			"

												Great game! (Spoiler Alert!) As you start out in the sea of some planet that you chose, you eat others and things found in the waters to eventually become a land animal. As you progress you get to create your own creature and make civilization. Others advance with you to become an enemy or an ally. You then take over the planet and create your first space ship to explore space, try taking other planets, and going into war with other colonies on other planets just because you want to. 10/10			"

												If you buy the bundle, the DLCs count as separate games. So, if you want to access everything, launch Spore: Galactic Adventures instead of the other 2 games. (This is good for those who want to pad their Steam game count. 3 games instead of 1.)(Shows 0.2 hours since I launch it from Galactic Adventures instead. Each has their own playtime.)30FPS lock. This can be fixed if you find the 60FPS guide and go over what the guy says. However, DO NOT copy/paste the codes straight from the guide. You need to have the spaces exactly like the screenshots. No V-Sync option, though going into Nvidia Control Panel and enabling it fixed it for me.No Anti-Aliasing option, but going into Nvidia Control Panel again and enabling it works.No Autosaves and crashes randomly. So manually save often.Even in 30FPS, it's still a lot of fun. Highly recommend, even though it has poor graphics options.			"

												'SPORE' is a game where you start off crash landed from a meteor into a planet and you're trying to grow from your tiny bacteria to a large galactic nation. You play through multiple stages and choose how your civilization progresses.Pros:-You can play this through more then once and will get a different outcome-You get to customize nearly EVERYTHING to your liking-Can keep you occupied for hours-Runs wellCons:-Some evoloution stages are extremly short-Galactic stage is the longest by far and I wished the others were made longer-No autosave so if the game DOES crash you're doomed			"

												Fantastic game that I loved back when it first came out and I love it still. Basically it's a mixed genre game. When you start it you have casual amoeba swimming game. Then you evolve and go to land where you go around eating fruits or other animals until you advance to tribal stage. Tribal stage becomes a kind of a lightweight RTS where you attack other tribes, create tools, equip them to your tribe members. After advancing to Civilization age, you start to build cities, defenses, vehicles (land, air, naval) and it's even more of RTS. And then you go into space... :) The best part of the game is definitely Creature Creator though. It's easy to use and you can make  many different cute creatures, only your imagination is the limit. Spore is a nice game, and additional pack add to the game but are optional.You can even play with the music and change it during gameplay (different beats and stuff).It's not the best game ever, but I can recommend it without any problems, especially if you're into building stuff (Sims, Sim City...)  Graphics:  ★★★★★ Sound:  ★★★★☆ Gameplay:  ★★★★☆ Music:  ★★★★☆   Overall:  ★★★★☆ "

												Spore is a bit incredulously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.It introduces something amazing, an entirely new concept with you, but when you get about halfway through the game it takes that all away from you with hardly any reason or meaning why.Playing a new game, you start as a little microbe thing with some very basic gameplay and some addictive mechanics. The goal of this stage is to eat and get bigger until you fill up the meter at the bottom, it's promising but gets boring fast which is just as well because the stage can be over that fast if you want it to be and you can move on to become a proper Spore creature, going into Creature stage.Creature stage... is the best part of the game. This is the part where you're shown an almost infinite variety and customizability combinations in the creature editor, with all sorts of interesting options and different things. You can make a four or six legged monstrosity with ♥♥♥♥ing spikeballs coming out of it's nose or maybe a ball with a pair of legs and four arms, with a ridiculous variety of hands, mouths, eyes, assortments of weapons and the likes.And if that didn't already appeal to you, on top of all this, you're shown an expansive world with other species which you can befriend or extinct and giant ♥♥♥♥ing creatures you can attempt to slay if you get powerful enough for thrills. And this courses through an ENTIRE PLANET of these other species and massive creatures. This appealed to me so much that I absolutely loved everything about it, it was so thrilling, it was absolutely majestic and wonderful.But then comes Tribal stage. Once you're filled on the meter at the bottom and maybe have the full look for your creature that you want, the content was pretty stunted there. Personally, I would have loved to have the whole game be Creature stage, just getting progressively better.Instead, it's all taken away from you. You're shown an entirely different genre of game in some sadistic attempt to radically change your idea on playing the game. Initially, I dismissed this as EA's standard policy to alienate their entire ♥♥♥♥ing demographic and tried to make sense of it, but no.Your love that you put into your creature to maybe make it more socially friendly or combat advantageous in Creature stage? Poof. The only things you retain from Creature stage are the actual planet (which is no longer free-roam), the other species on it (now lowered to domestic pets and other rising tribes which are pretty generic and bland) and the look of your creature as well as it's voice and how it moves (like if you have a four-legged creature, it moves the same way it did when you were controlling it yourself, but it's generic and loses it's charm). The whole game turned into this forced, linear pathway that is completely different from what was shown to you earlier.Tribal was pretty short, though. Civilisation stage... Ugh. It introduced an entirely new editor, but it was like it was trying to shoehorn user creativity back into the game, but with no real purpose. The things in Creature stage were actually relevant to the gameplay, like combat and social, with the other idea of it being whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want and it can apply to the actual gameplay, like moving on. While Civilisation stage things do have the element of application to gameplay, it's just less and less content. There's only the coolness in making vehicles. That's it.Space stage is another step where the Civilisation stage was going in the first place, you deal in planets instead of nations/cities, you deal with a galaxy instead of a world... It's incredibly boring, though. There's combat segments and some customization, but the game lost all charm for me at this point.But yes, if you agree with everything I said and want to buy the game, then NEVER progress past Creature stage unless you REALLY want to. It's not that rewarding. Incredible beginning content with incredible mechanics, but really sucks later on.			"

												Really enjoyed spore. It came out many years ago, on my birthday and I had my dad get it for my present when I was younger. It was really a fun game, I enjoyed it a lot, and I enjoy it even better now that I have a better computer. The graphics are chunky, and that's just what makes it's style!Good:-------------------------------------------+Make custom creatures+Literally customize anything, you want it's toe to be huge, but the legs to be small? GO FOR IT.+Runs basically on any pc, it's such an old game.+Graphics look nice actually, on my Gx950 graphics card.+Each mode is indepth, so you can get different endings and benefits depending on the path you took.+You can technically upload your creations and download others.Bad:--------------------------------------------+I havent personally been able to log into my EA account, so I play offline.+This game isn't what people wanted it to be - but it's good for those who don't care what it was 'supposed' to be. My husband and I played this as young teens, and we enjoyed a lot for what it was.+ Multiple ending types, and creature spawns can be good, but it can feel old after a while with the AI being similar each game.

Also, there are different stages which your species goes into. You start out as a cell and then work your way up. I think my only complaint about this game was that it was fairly short.

												Okay....soo I am reviewing this from when I played it many years ago shortly after it came out on PC. At the time I remember looking this game up and seeing its promise for a in-depth evolution system which seemed almost too complicated for me to understand but sure looked fun as hell~So I got it on a CD at some point and I remember playing it all night and day. It was a few weeks before I stopped but while playing it I felt like it was missing something, like I was playing half of the game that was promised. At the time I was on end-game stuff which is the spaceship stage (which pretty much never ends). So I started to realize it isn't really complicated and in-depth as it was promised to be. It seems more basic and nothing super advanced.... but I still loved it. Its a shame though because it could of still been something much MUCH bigger if it had more depth. Also apparently some of the Sport EA servers are shut down now so there isn't much of a community for the game now.To keep it short...the game is really fun if you like a mixture of RPG, Sims, Strategy games with heavy customization to keep it personal and unique to every person. I highly recommend this game still even if it is a bit dull around the edges.			"

If you have ever wanted to be involved in the evolution process of a species, or ever wanted to fly the galaxy while expanding your civilization to other planets in the universe, or simply just create a species, just to watch it get erradicated or destroyed by another sentient species,  Then I highly suggest you check out Spore!

												At best, a guilty pleasure. At worst, a miserable pile of disappointing crap. When originally announced, the game promised many interesting concepts and tools for creation. When released, it was a mish-mash of oversimplified mini-games leading up to a fairly disappointing space stage. It doesn't help that there is very little quality control with the user generated content, so most of the new creatures you'll see will be horrifying blobs or♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters. Would only advise if heavily discounted during a Steam Sale.			"

												It only took me 8 years to play it... yes, get it. You can feel the quality, it's a powerful game, every phase is new and well done and the progression feels great. It might feel short after the first playthrough though.I have no idea if the online features work and I don't really care. There are minor bugs and problems with the AI, for example in tribal stage when gathering food, but playing around with your own creations makes more than up for it. For example: you may see your ship from the other playthrough abducting other creatures or crashed in some random planet... The end game, in space, it's an almost endless sandbox to play in. I like it, every game should have this.tl;dr Great replay value, great game, complex but inviting.			"

												This game was initially  overhyped, but beneath the surface is something totally worthwhile, if somewhat simplistic. However, simple isn't always bad in games, and quite often some ofthe most addicting games are quite simple (Candy Crush) or have some simple elements (sneaking around  clueless NPCs in Skyrim). Spore is not Candy Crush, however it certainly isn't Skyrim either.  Spore has an amazing creation engine that is in an of itself completely fun to  use. Growing up I used to joke about there one day being game that was  nothing more than the create a character function, where that WAS the game. Spore is not that game. Even with the parts pack it will give you at best one more page or less of pieces to mess around with. (Yet to this day EA has no qualms about still charging $19.99 for even its worst  reviewed Sims 3 expansions.) Spore could have been better but this was before Minecraft sold for an enormous sum and the industry took note of how much life you can breathe into a piece of software by allowing people real creative  control. I'm sure at the time EA was more worried about ""Sporn"" and other issues they didn't want to spend their time managing to preserve the game,  and the company's, brand image.  Spore though presents some amazing possibilities, and also functions in some ways as a statement on life  itself, from the single celled on up. No matter how big and complex we get, we still seem to encounter some of the same essential problems.  I do recommend Spore, but even more so I recommend EA make a sequel. Spore only requires 4gb of space, a modern AAA game will usually require 15 times that. There is a lot of room for expansion here, and profit, if EA is willing to construct a sequel that allows their engine to more fully serve people's creative impulses.			"

												Will Wright's fascination with letting people play god  from SimCity in 1989 to the game that garnered worldwide fame and cemented EA as the top-dog in game publishing for over half a decade, The Sims has led to Spore, the first game where your actions truly feel godlike. But a new Sim game this is not, and this is apparent right from the moment your asteroid fragment breaks apart and you lay eyes on the amoeba-like creature you're going to manifest.At the start, you're prompted to choose between being a carnivore or a herbivore, and that determines whether your little cell starts with a meat-eating jaw or a collection of small tentacle-like appendages for tearing apart microscopic plant matter. You direct your cell around and eat accordingly. Eating and surviving  are the only real objectives for this first section of the game, which plays like an organic blend of fl0w and Pac-Man, and becomes progressively more difficult as your cell becomes multicellular bigger and more complex.Eventually you'll devour enough to grow a (tiny) brain, and advance to the second phase of the game  the creature phase.Immediately taken to the creator, now in 3D your humble little cell can now use a pair of legs. As your new belegged creature wanders landward, with identical friends in tow, you get your first glimpse of your home planet. This phase of the game is more complex, and you must choose between befriending the other species you encounter, and eradicating them from the face of the planet. The latter works similarly to combat in games like World of Warcraft. You've got a set of abilities and when you use an ability, you trigger a cooldown.The third phase the tribal section  works like a small-scale RTS, with resource collecting, unit production and building construction. You must assign villagers various tasks and spend food on hatching new tribe members, or adding to your small pool of buildings. Again you'll meet other tribes, and you'll be forced to choose between allying with them and systematically dismembering them and torching their huts.The entire time you've been playing, the game has tracked your actions and determined various passive and active bonuses for the next part accordingly, and depending on your technique, you'll end up as a military nation, a religious nation or an economic nation.The actual gameplay for this section plays out like a simplified version of Rise of Nations. You capture resource points, build units, and try to take over the other cities with them. The depth lies within the ability to design the layout of the cities, thereby determining how resistant to attacks they are, and how efficient at making money they are. During the final phase of the game, having unified your planet, you once again take control of a single entity and man a spacecraft.here are several introductory missions to get you used to the capabilities of your ship, and before long you're flying between stars and meeting other races. No longer earthbound, you are literally free to do whatever you want. Interaction with other races is much more fleshed out in this section of the game. There are dialogue boxes a la Sid Meier's Civilization where you can choose to trade goods, or take diplomatic actions, and the races each have their own fleshed out personality.In conclusion, Spore is definitely an exciting game in this time of repetitive ideas in an over crowded gaming market. It's not quite an RTS nor an RPG nor a strategy game but one that successfully combines all three genres into an exciting game that works quite well and is complimented with good graphics and a great premise.Overall 9/10.

												I enjoyed this game. I recommend buying the DLC for it as well though, because the Galactic Adventures DLC adds a lot. You could do without the other one though, but you might as well get it too if you have the money. (read no further if you don't want to know what happens as you progress.)You start off on a planet of your choosing. From here you get to start off as a microscopic creature where you can evolve over time by either eating what I assume is algae, or other creatures. From this, paths branch off. You evolve into a mindless animal, who either tries to make friends with other creatures, fights others, or both. Then you evolve again into a tribe, where the same principles apply.  The only sad part is that you can't choose to be an underground civilization, or one that dwells in trees, underwater or on top of mountains. You can choose to give your creature wings though, if you'd like them to ""fly"". It's sort of just gliding, due to the fact that you can only flap your wings about 5 times or something like that.The next stage of evolution brings you to city life, where you can either choose to dominate other nations economically, religiously, or through war. Once you've dominated all of the other nations, you advance yet again to the space stage. It's basically the same thing all over again, but in space with spaceships. That's not just it though. In space you get a variety of different missions in which you can colonize planets, eradicate diseased creatures, and even elevate tribal civilizatons!That's not just it though. You get to create basically everything from your creature (which you can change until you get the later stages), to the buildings in which they live and work. Not only that, but you get to create their land vehicles, air vehicles, and boats. Then once you get to the space stage you get to create the spaceship model that your whole empire uses. If you want to play smart during the city and space stages, you can micromanage some of your cities to gain more income. Income is used to purchase vehicles during the city stage, and upgrades for your ship during the space stage. You get simple money during the city stage, but in the space stage, cities produce spice. You can sell the spices that are produced for a lot of money, if you can find the right person to sell them to.Your goal is to reach the center of the galaxy, for who knows what might be there? But many obstacles stand in your way. Deal with them how you wish, because there are multiple ways to get there. Make friends, or dominate others to bring your rule to the whole galaxy. It's up to you. Just remember that everyone needs allies, or just really big guns. Lastly. The game is really monotonous in my opinion. But I like those sorts of games. If you're not a fan of monotonous tasks then you might not be a fan of this game in particular.  Despite my annoyances with this game, I still enjoyed it a lot. Especially the missions that the DLC had to offer. I'd give this game a solid 7/10			"

												Since I've played a little bit, let me tell you why it's awesome: In General The game has multiple stages: Cell stage, Creature Stage, Tribal Stage, Civilization Stage, and Space stage. You can make friends and enemies YOU CAN KILL EVERYONE You can befriend everyone <3 (at least until you get into the civ stage, where everyone hates you) The video above this review makes this game look nothing like it actually is. 3 Different levels of difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard.  Cell stage  EAT  EVERYTHING  AS AN OMNIVORE. EVERYTHIIING!!!! *OR* Eat just plants as an herbivore. Eat just meat as a carnivore What you decide to eat is what you eat for the rest of the game. You can also put on herbivore and carnivore mouths on to eat things other than what you mostly ate in the cell stage BECOME THE MOST MONSTROUS SPERM CELL TO EVER EXIST Eat things for DNA points. Creature Stage ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥monsters. You can literally make almost anything you want. Kill things or socialize with things for dna points to customize your creature. Tribal Stage SPOILER  IF YOU PLAY THIS ON A CARNIVORE RUN ON HARD, PREPARE YOUR♥♥♥♥♥♥FOR A LONG GAME OF WAR Food is the new DNA. Run out of food and you're screwed.  I'm almost certain that being an herbivore is easier Kill people and destroy their tribes to add to your totem pole Befriend people and add them to your totem pole Hate everyone because they are ALWAYS ♥♥♥♥ING ATTACKING YOU Civilization Stage  Laugh at everyone when you destroy or take over their cities Laugh at everyone who accepts your cheap buy offers Hate every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ military city Place building in your cities in any way you want to.  Space Stage  Have no idea what you are doing Find out what to do Become the second largest empire in the galaxy Have more money than you know what to do with Kill everyone Befriend everyoneThats about all I have to say about this game. Enjoy!			"

												For the record, my hours with this game with the GA expansion are DISPROPORTIONATELY HUGE compared to what's being shown here. Like, 600+ hours.Absolutely love this game, I never stop coming back to play it.I will admit, when I first got this game, oh, 4-ish years ago, I was expecting a tad bit more out of it than I saw. Then again, Spore, in and of itself was an INCREDIBLY ambitious game in its early stages. It's not the perfect, all-encompassing game some, like me, might hope it to be, but it is incredibly fun and incredibly challanging on the higher difficulties, ESPECIALLY in space, which is pretty much nigh impossible to completely ""finish"", lest you have no life whatsoever. It's nice and kid-friendly with the cartoonish creature designs, and the quick gameplay up to the space stage is a boon for casual gamers. But for those of us seeking to conquer the galaxy, and get the real sense of action and adventure, the space stage has enough alien genocides, nuclear explosions, and planet busting for even the most hardcore 4X strategy gamer. It's an enjoyable game with a nice mix of everything and quite a few challenges mixed in. If nothing else, play it for the space stage; probably the best, least mundane part of the game.The DLCs add some nice features as well; the new adventure feature in Galactic Adventures adds an interesting new level of complexity and depth to the already complex space stage, and makes nice use of the creature properties you all thought were going to be useless after the creature stage.Side note, FINALLY managed to make a decent-looking human with the in-game parts - a painful ordeal, to be sure.Oh, and make sure not to♥♥♥♥♥♥off the Grox if you like your♥♥♥♥♥where it is.

												Great game even though it's been around for a while. Pretty much create your creature from the begining of a single cell and through different stages of evolution. Until your creature is the master of the universe or so. Hope the heck you don't get eating at the begining by much larger creatures. But It's a fun game as you are able to change and add different parts to your creature as it goes through the stages of evolution.			"

												Very interesting game to play...really brings out your creative side. When you first start playing, your first reaction is usually, ""Awwww! It's so cute!"" or, ""Oh my god It's going to eat me!"" Let me say that this game is very realistic, and if you love animals, or ""creatures"" you should surely choose to be an herbivore. You choose from Carnivore, Herbivore, and Omnivore. Sometimes you'll say, ""Ugh, there's too much going on!"" or, ""Give me a break!"" But in the end things will calm down and you will begin enjoying the game a lot more once you get the hang of it and what to do and what not to do...the easiest way, and the hardest way. Once you get to space though, the game's pace slows down considerably. You get into kind of a routine and begin doing the same thing over and over again. Some quit at that point, and just keep creating games and stopping at space, but if you get past the more boring or slow-paced parts, it gets fun and ""not-so-boring."" All in all, if you like a game with plenty of chances to show off your creativity, I would definitely recommend this game.			"

												Highly underappreciated game. What spore lacks in finese it makes up for in scope. Like most SIM games the fun is directly tied into how much you enjoy creating things and being creative. If you don't enjoy spending hours making your creature look like a vampire squirrel and then evolving them into space venturing capitalist rodents, well, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else, once you are past the glitches (there are plenty even now), its a good waste of time and a creative outlet.			"

												There's a lot to be said for spore.Tld;r Spore is a game that features multiple stages of life, each serving as a unique game-mode of sorts, all starring your own custom created lifeform, contending for survival against other randomly generated life form. The biggest flaw in this game is that each mode seems so short, and lacking depth.If the worst thing I could say about this game is there's not enough of it, it could definitely have some worse flaws.It's a really unique and enjoyable experience, with some glaring flaws. Its a game that allows the player to experience the evoulationary stage of their very own creations. It's greatest and worst feature is the various stages of life you play as. more on that later.to describe the game, you start out with a cell that you modify and fight other cells. its an interesting sort of ""big eat small"" game type that last until you eventually evolve into the next stage of life. This next stage of life consists of creating a land walking creature using various parts consisting of heads, mouths, arms legs, and more, to fend for itself among a randomly generated selection of creatures, both gigantic and small. This stage is fun in its own merit, but eventually leads onto a tribal stage.The tribal stage was the most fun for me, a sort of RTS village manager. You select groups of people to roam about the world and gather resources for the village. After this you evolve into a civilization style game, which wasn't bad at all either. You manage cities, their happiness and resource output and whatnot while conquering other cities. After this is a space exploration mode which I haven't played at this time (I know its been out forever!)  "

												I really tried to love this game. It is cute, funny, open-ended, and explores new grounds for videogames. If anything, it is admirable. But is it fun? The mechanics in every evolutionary stage are rather shallow and repetitive, the strategy components are severly limited and the action components reduced to a few button presses once in a while. Exploration falls flat too since the procedural planets are boring and samey.The draw of this game for many seems to be the character creator, as evident by the slew of creature videos on youtube, and it is entertaining for a while, but cannot hold my attention for long.In the end, it is suprisingly... boring.

												Great game, you can abduct civilians and jettison them into space. 10/10But seriously though its a game where u can create your own creature starting from the cell stage through to having inter-galactic wars throughout the galaxy. The galaxy is made up of around 500,000 stars. Each star has its own planets and many have their own civilisations or animals.When you are connected through the internet in spore you will end up seeing other peoples creatures and civilisations pop up in your world. And also your own creatures from other saves.BTW The reason i have so little hours on this is because i played through one of the dlc's in which i have a hundred and something hours			"

												I love this game. I originally got the boxed version of it for Christmas a few years ago. Last year I got a new PC, and unfortunately my CD would no longer work. I am so glad that steam had this, as the steam version of this game is essentially DRM Free (Steam is the DRM in this case.) And now I can install it on as many Windows PCs as I want. Unfortunately there is no Mac version, like the boxed edition has. So if you have a Mac, you need to use the boxed version, or the origin version, which has the DRM unfortuneately. The only cons I can think of with this version at least, are sometimes, when you die in the creature stage, the game crashes (only happens after you move nests for the first time, but seems to stop happening once you have a big enough brain to advance to tribal.) And the game may crash when you are placing buildings in your cities in the Civilization or Space Stage. (Usually this only happens in space, when you have LARGE empire, and even then it isn't too killing. Just save before placing buildings.)Now for a list of Pros and Cons:Pros:Very Robust gameplay. 5 stages, Cell, Creature, Tribe, Civilization, Space. I like each of them a lot, but I feel that the Tribe and Civilization stages are waay to short. In the Cell Stage, you are a Cell, and you need to eat, and evolve. In the Creature stage, you are a Creature, and your goal is to develop your brain, while at the same time collecting parts, and improving your Creature. The Tribe and Civilization stages play more like an RTS, and your goal is to dominate all the tribes and civilizations. In the space stage, it is essentially an open-ended sandbox, and you can do pretty much whatever you want. The only downside is you don't have unlimited money, so it isn't a TRUE sandbox.Attention to detail. This game looks quite realistic, but still has that cartoony feel to it. The Water looks very similar to real life water, especially when the sun is reflecting off of it. Creatures, and Plants, with certain paint coats, will also have the sun reflect off of it, and it looks quite pretty. There are also Nebula, and even Supernovas (Which is just eye candy, no stars actually blow up.)Replayability. There are 10 different archetypes in space stage, and each has a unique superpower. The possibilities to get all archetypes are practically endless. The archetypes are, Warrior, Shaman, Trader, Ecologist, Scientist, Knight, Zealot, Diplomat, Bard, and Wanderer. Each has a unique super power, and if you have galatic adventures, can obtain the other super powers via adventures, without losing your current super power. (with the exception of knights and wanderers. The Knight Super Power is impossible to acheive via galactic adventures, only through evolution. And Wanderers do not have a superpower, as that is the archetype you get for starting in space.)Cons:The only one I can think of is the one I listed before, where the game may crash on death in the creature stage, or when building buildings in the Civ or Space Stage. Both are minor, and as long as you save frequently, you should be okay.Oh... and EA has abandoned this game unfortunately. They're too proud of the new Sim City, and the Sims 4 to even consider fixing this game, or making a sequel to this game, which really sucks. In America the servers for this game, are suprisingly still up, but AFAIK the European servers went down, but the Asian and Oceania servers are still up too I think. "

												If you're gonna get it, get it while it's 5 bucks. That is the price it is really worth, maybe 6. This game is a good stepping-stone for the evolution genre, and a few other indie games are following in it's path if you dig around on the internet. It's the first iteration of a still new genre. You can create a variety of your own creatures in the brilliant creature creator, and the main appeal of this is being able to see other people's creations in your world! Cool right?Well EA has abandoned this game, so don't expect to see anything cool other than what the game developers put in there. Sometimes you can see your own creations, so that's cool.Unfortunately, despite the variety of creatures, most of them behave the same way. You a few abilities, ranging from stealth to very limited flying. You can be a herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore.The game has 5 stages that are all pretty different, but the game shines in Creature mode, the second stage. Where you control one creature in your species, and evolve it as it gets more sentient. Like I said before, most creatures behave the same way in Creature mode. They all hang around in their nests and hardly interact with eachother, and if they do they don't do it enough. I wanted to see creatures huntings other creatures, and bird-like creatures and bugs, but all I saw was one wandering into an aggressive territory and getting slaughtered. There is no variety of roles in the ecosystem of the game. It's just ""Five Boogleborfs hanging around a nest. Kill them or sing at them?"" And that's it. Sometimes you see ""Epics"" which are huge creatures, that are indeed epic. Every once in a while a world event happens, like a meteor shower or a UFO flies by. While cool, they don't mean anything.They did a good job of making a world that looks real from far away. But get closer, and you see all sorts of flaws and places for massive improvement.Buy it now while it's 5 bucks. Otherwise I don't recommend. Stick around, in a while ""THRIVE"" will come out. Look it up, it sounds good.EDIT: It's good for kids though. I got this game when I was a little naive to the world of gaming, that's where most of my playtime come from.			"

												I absolutely love creating all sorts of weird monsters and creatures in this game!That aside, I do love this game, but it's nowhere near perfect. The grindy nature of this particular game genre (God Simulators, etc.) kinda wears thin after a while of playing it, making Spore a game that's better in short bursts. Aside from the creation of critters and buildings, the way the gameplay changes keeps it interesting, and the space level (once you make it) is actually quite deep and complex.Recommended? Yes, but only if you liked playing with legos as a kid (which should be everyone) or love God Sim games (which definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea).			"

Then they will pop everywhere and you will have forests of poorly made plants (I'm not saying you can't make good stuff. But you will mostly mess around, and you will be surrounded by your mistakes).Controls are kinda confusing for me.But the concept and gameplay is so worth it.			"

TL;DR : This is not a game; it's an environment in which you can admire your creature-making and vehicle-making skills in cool situations.  It's very repetetive, but the scope of the game allows for it to be somehow addictive once you reach the space-age.  So yeah, it's great for very casual gamers, but anyone who wants to experience interesting gameplay will find this game lacking.  Pick it up if it's a couple quid, but I wouldn't pay full-price for it.  Also, ignore the expansion packs.This isn't really one cohesive game, but a series of mini-games, so I'll just review each one seperately:Cellular Stage: No fun at all, but it's designed as a tutorial to introduce you to the creature-creation and DNA mechanics; swim towards stuff in 2D to get points once your creature auto-eats it - other creatures for 'bad'/'carnivore' points, plants for 'good'/'herbivore' points; a mixture for 'neutral'/'omnivore' points.Creature Stage: Like the cellular stage, but 3D, and to get the 'good' points, you have to sing, dance and pose your way into getting other creatures to like you.  Creature customisation gets real here and you spend most of your time wandering around picking up skeletons to unlock new parts.  This is the most boring stage IMHO due to it's repetition.Tribal Stage: Exactly like the creature stage apart from instead of unlocking new parts, you unlock buildings to give you weapons to kill, or instruments to win over other tribes; it's only less boring than the creature stage because it passes much more quickly.Civilisation Stage:The overall point of this stage is the same as the tribal stage, but you also get to design vehicles (land / sea / air) and buildings - as the modelling is the most fun part of the whole game, this is real fun.  You have a -little- bit of resource management as when you're putting the buildings in your city, there's an optimal pattern. It also introduces the 'diplomacy' mechanic which is basically 'get people to like you by giving them money, and then ask them to give you everything they own'.  This bit goes by in a flash, but that's good because the most fun part is...Space Stage:This is basically where you apply everything at once - you build spaceships, buildings, vehicles, and even new creatures (once you get the 'creature tweaker' tool for your spaceship).  You can basically take over the whole galaxy by terraforming each planet and putting down colonies...which is fun and satisfying for the first few times, but once you get your first million bucks everything becomes VERY easy and the game stops being fun to play.  It doesn't stop being addictive, however, because you still find yourself saying things like ""If I make my main spaceship look like a star destroyer, can I try and befriend every other alien race who's ships are TIE-fighters so I can fly around with an Imperial fleet?"" and you spend the next several hours exploring the galaxy finding / uplifting new races; or you set yourself the task of entirely wiping out the 'big bad' Grox...which I think is impossible, but still.So yeah, I mean...it's a really great casual game, but if you're after any depth at all you will end up disappointed.  It is very cool flying around in an X-Wing though, and painting every planet white...and setting the ground units to imperial walkers and the air-units to Snow Speeders so you can re-enact the battle of Hoth...

												I've been playing Spore pretty much since it came out, back then it was buggy as hell and unsupported, but that was ON windows Vista, and Vista sucks, I recently brought the game after I moved onto Windows 8, Spore only crashed once, literally.Spore in my opinion is a great game, even though it's EA, but Spore is very creative and smart, starting from a very tiny fish to a full grown Galactic Space Empire, it takes a good amount of time to do the game to get to Space stage, in my opinion, Space stage is the most fun stage since I love space and exploring planets and communicating with other alien races, you can be evil like the Grox and destory alien empires, destory planets and stuff, or you can be really friendly and be friends with many alien races as possible.My favourite easter egg in Spore is finding Earth, out of the 50,000 stars (That's how many stars there are in Spore's game), it's really hard however when you find Earth, you also find all the planets in the solar system apart from Pluto, because Pluto is not a planet anymore, fegits.I highly recommend that you buy it, Spore is very fun.

												Spore...A game of creation, evolution, destruction, and betrayal. In this game you start as a cell, and you slowly make your way to galactic domination. You'll meet, and kill many funny and cool looking creations. I really do enjoy what the game offers, and the things you can create, and destroy! Though when I play Spore, I often wonder how someone can manage to make a creature that is seriously cool. I just go with whatever works.			"

If there is going to be a new update: FIX THIS TRIBAL AGE FREEZE THING BECAUSE I HAVE THIS PROBLEM! HEAR ME EA GAMES? Also It isnt worth it buying the spore creepy and cute parts pack and the galactic adventures! Theese are just useless: the price is too high for one Mod-like thing. I give it 7.5/10.			"

												Amazing.Pros- This is the true meaning of 'customizable'.- You can slowly but surely buy out cities through trading, use your powwer of pink straw hats to spread your religion across the globe, or just blow it all up.(Same goes for the other mode, you've got choices.)- Some of your creations show up on other save files. (E.G. a spaceship belonging to a save in Space Stage abducts one of your pets in Tribal stage)-Several 'stages'  = Cell stage (Ever heard of Agar.io? That's what this is, but cooler.) Eat anything smaller than you. Run away from anything bigger. Have kids. Grow an extra fin. Repeat.  = Creature stage: Grow legs and walk around. Hunt a few species to extinction. Make friends with (relative) giants. Get killed by (actual) giants.  = Tribal stage: Kill everything that moves to death and/or hug everything that moves. (The former is much more reliable, you know.) Also: Avoid the giants.  = Civilization Stage: A simplified version of Sid Meyer's Civilization for dummies that has been simplified, with more customizability. Watch as your trade routes get torn apart by afforementioned giants.  = Space Stage: Make your spaceship and conquer/hug the galaxy. Destroy giants with your kickass lasers and nukes.Cons:- Creature stage can take FOREVER. (Due to giants.)- One or two glitches. (Not many)- A certain cool DLC isn't available anymore.- The Bor- (What? Did I say Borg? I meant Grox) are overpowered, and you can't get the Genesis Dev- (*Cough cough* The staff of life *Cough cough*) because of them.			"

												Summary: 4 Mini-games plus one giant bore.Multiplayer: NoCompletion: Never ends, but I stopped at 20 hrs.Cards: NoCloud: NoSpore is one of those rare games that within 5 minutes of playing it, I felt like I had to complete it. I genuinely enjoyed the beginning stages of the game, but that rush progressively became less and less enchanting with each progressing age.The game is essentially 4 mini-games strung together with 1 giant never-ending game at the end. You start out as a single-cell organism struggling for survival in a world of eat-or-be-eaten. It's a nice, relaxing evolution game, and to be honest, I would have been perfectly fine if the majority of the game was like this. But this age is over all too soon and you'll find yourself on taking your first steps on land.As a terrestrial creature, new challenges arise. It's time to make friends, kill enemies, fight for survival, and forage for food. It's a good progression from the cell stage an it's kind of fun, but not as much as the previous age. Soon, your species will propogate to the point of having their own town. Around this point the game feels like a stripped-down RTS game. You gather resources, forge alliances, crush clans, and expand. It's a rather awkward stage and the gameplay itself is also so radically different that it almost feels out of place.The civlization stage is similar to the tribal stage, but you have entire cities and vehicles to do your bidding. Rather than playing like an RTS game, now it feels like a stripped-down Civlization game. You get to do some major customization now, but it's all cosmetic. As you near the end of the stage, the time comes to launch your first rocket.The Space Age makes up the bulk of the game. Now a space-faring race, you do pretty much what you were doing before but on a much grander scale. Hundreds of planets to explore, most of them look the same-ish, and to be honest, this is easily the most boring part of the game. Play as a Fedex service, do some feng shui on planets, become a trader, there's so much to do in this stage... and yet there's no real goal, other than than reaching a certain part of the galaxy, but the game will still go on regardless.Overall, Spore is... difficult for me to rate. The parts I liked, I liked a lot. The parts I disliked, I got bored to tears. What began as a fun evolution game ultimately ends up as a chore. The amount of micromanagement magnifies tenfold with each passing stage, and since the game changes radically with each stage, it's constantly throwing new stuff at you, while simultaneously rendering old knowledge irrelevant. I'm sure many people enjoy the endgame, but definitely not me. I give this a 7/10. "

Spore is a great game with a ton of unique features that make this game differnt from the others. After playing it again and again i can say that this is a game with much replay value allowing players to experiment with differnt combinations of creature types like becoming an omnivore or becoming a waring civilization or simply making it so your species can finnacially succeed. I can also say that all the different stages add something different to the emersion of gameplay whether your managing food in tribal or designing new vehicles in the civilazation stage.The space stage may seem repetitve and tedious but not only does the rest of the game make up for it but the creators added the Galactic Adventures DLC to make things more interesting. But, as an older games there is expected to be bugs to it graphically or bugs that affect gameplay. The only major one i've come across with my crappy computer was an occasinally crash that shuts the program out. A simple solution is to simply save the game constantly. Besides that there is hours of gameplay that is fun to pick up once and a while. I suggest this to anyone who just wants to play god and screw with life. Even though it says i have only played it for a small amount of time i've been playing it on a seperate file on the DLC for over a hundred hours so listen to some of my advice. "

												Did not live up to its hype.Would be a fine and fun sandbox game, however, if EA's idea of ""game help"" wasn't ""sure, we know as a new Origin user you can't access online features. We know this is a major part of the game you just paid for. We have had an ""unresolved"" on this issue up on our ""help"" page since July. We're aware. We just don't care. In fact, we're shutting down the online servers next year anyhow, so why even bother?""If you did not have an Origin account before June 2013, be aware you will not be able to access patches or online features. Otherwise, it's not a bad game, if a little restrictive.https://help.ea.com/article/spore-login-issue-for-new-origin-customersPlease also see comments below.

												At first I was going to get this game just to say that No Man's Sky is the off brand version of this. But as I started to play the game I then realized of how much of a great game this is. In Spore you get to progress froma a simple unicellular organism and gradually progress to the early stages of the human and eventually surpasing the human technology is the space stage of the game. You get to extend your creativity considering that you have the potential to create and evolve your creature, and later even design your own vehicles and buildings. This has many different games inside of it: cell stage being like a more graphically instive version of agar.io (Btw I never knew that it looks like agar.io took there idea from spore), the survival aspect of the land stage, the real time strategy aspects of both the tribal and civilization stage, and finally the unlimited diplomatic and warring space stage. Incredible game.			"

												There is so much to love about this game. Even in its simplicity it just sucks you in and keeps you playing for hours. You really get invested in the creatures you create and early decisions have long lasting effects with such a wide variety that replayablity is endless. I have one major gripe with this game. There is no option for autosave. Now because of the size of the save files, it takes a few seconds to save, so I get why it was designed without autosave in mind but for the amount of complaining players have done since its release, this game should've been updated with an autosave feature as an option. The reason this bothers me so much, is because the game will occasionally crash. The way the game plays tends to make you forget to frequently save. Between designing your cells, later your creatures, tribes and buildings and playing with them in between, you click on a ""Save and Exit"" button when you finish your design but this saves your creature, not your game. And you are not able to load that creature again when you go back to an old save. I originally had this review as a do not recommend, but with some tweaking the crashes have been brought to a minimum and the amount of fun this game has to offer is just out of this world. Some players may be put off by the early stages and just want to put their creatures into the Space Stage of the game, but I feel that misses the point of Spore. While Spore offers you a ""Creature Creator"" that lets you design your creatures before you play with them, I prefer to create my creatures in the game using their history and experience to unlock DNA parts and giving them long lasting traits which result from your earliest decisions. You also get to share your creations and if logged on to the game, you will see the creatures of other players in your game as well. Overall I have to recommend this game.			"

												This was one of my first games on steam, and I still play it. I have loved everything about this, from the cell stage to the space age, and any other gamer will say the same. I highly recommend it. The graphics aren't great, but somehow that just adds to the feel of evolving your creature, giving it everything it needs to survive and become sentient. Whether you like shooters, RPGs, MMOs, Sandboxes, Indies or just a casual gamer, YOU NEED TO GET THIS GAME. so stop reading this reveiw, thinking about whether to spend 20.00 USD on something you won't play, AND BUY IT.

												I shall talk about each stage then my toughts overall, and it will be a big waste of time for no one will read.Stage 1: The first stage is simple, you are a cell, eat other cells, avoid other cells, cell cells with your cell phone, very basic but pretty fun, you can buy upgrades to eat cells better, also you can eat other stuff i geuss, but nobody does that (exept PETA but I doubt they played this game, plus ♥♥♥♥ PETA) Its very simple to that fish game but with cells.Rating: 6.5/10, Its kinda funStage 2: You have evolved and moved on to the genocide creature stage, here you are a land creature and must kill (Or befriend but nobody does that(once again exept for PETA)) other creatures, steal body parts from them, equip the body parts, become stronger, kill more creatures, I think you get it. However it gets much more complicated from there, those were just basic basics, the creator system is very in depth and people create some damn awsome stuff with it, or you know, you could just place OP♥♥♥♥♥♥all over your creature, that works too. You can also mate, migrate, gr8 b8 and other stuff, this is proably the most famous and praised stage of the game, its a symbol of spore, and its l o a d s a f u n whats that spell? LOADSAFUN.Rating:8/10 great lots of fun too be hadStage 3: The stupid tedious boring annyoing garbage tribal stage, in this stage♥♥♥♥♥♥starts to get real, you get armor, fight with weapons, and do other♥♥♥♥♥♥in a RTS style, does that sound fun? WELL ITS NOT.This is easily the worst stage in the game, its slow, monotonous, and annoying, the gameplay is shallow as ♥♥♥♥, the thing feels so much longer than it really is and it just sucks, you can kill other tribes (Once again,♥♥♥♥♥♥about PETA), and creatures, (PETA)advance as a soicitey, claim some tiki things, make babies, but all of it is executed poorly, its not unplayable, but its not fun either.Rating:5/10  below average Stage 4: OH GOD ITS A RTS AGAIN WH- oh nevermind this is done well.Yep, I LIKE the civilization stage even tough most hate it and even tough i hated the tribal stage, you are probably very confused right now but allow me to explain. You see it may be a RTS again but this time its a GOOD RTS, the gameplay is intresting and deep, the...... um.... well there isnt much to say, I geuss im bad at this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The civilization stage takes place during your species era of civilization holy♥♥♥♥♥♥mind blown more specificly around the time of it where we live in, you start with a rover thingamajiger and make it get spice, then♥♥♥♥♥♥gets intresting now in this stage, this might shock you but........... its worth not just killing everything  YOU TRATIOR YOU WORK WITH PETA DONT YOU?! ok the PETA  thing dosent make much sense here, we would proably not consider these animals now that they are as far as humans, now you can do THREE things with other members of your own species, including kill (holy♥♥♥♥♥♥they really are becoming like humans), join up with, and buy out others (Facebook would be proud), you see, buying out is pretty much the best thing to do, how I do it is, make money, buy or join others, use their♥♥♥♥♥♥to add to mine and ♥♥♥♥ up a weaker group, buy and join some others to get even stronger, rince and repeat till total domination. You can build ground attacker aswell as ones that sail the seas, and ones that fly (Best ones, ovbs), Its a very fun stage infact..... I prefer it to the creaure stage (Gets stabbed)Rating:8/10 very funStage 5: The final frontier SPPPPPPPPPPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE, Your species enters the Omnicide space age and goes into space to do space things, you start off getting into your ship and riding around for a little while, upducting some hazardous♥♥♥♥♥♥ disposing of it, saving your city, then you go into SPACE! Its time, this is easily the most in depth stage, and im too lazy too go too in-depth, What? Didnt you see the length for the 4th stage reveiw thing? this one in-depth would be MULTIPLE times longer, ♥♥♥♥ that. So heres the shorter version, you encounter many other species and using your ship and its ♥♥♥♥ton of gadgets you kill, team up with, steal from, do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want with them (Unless you get rekt). Now in this stage there is some STORY, Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥right? There are creatures called the Grox who are, well... evil, and they kill♥♥♥♥♥♥and are all big bad yadda yadda, so you become stronger, go to barren planets, harvest spice, spread your people, join other species, killt them, and its all on a ♥♥♥♥ING HUGE map, Near the center of the galaxy is where the grox reside and MAN they dont ♥♥♥♥ around, finding routes to the center while being attacked by legions of ships kicking thy♥♥♥♥♥♥is VERY tough, you must be very srategic, powerful, and get lucky with where routes lead, or ya know you could just join em, in the end you can reach the center and theres some♥♥♥♥♥♥about humans IDK.Rating:9/10 Super amazing and easily the highlight of the entire gameOverall rating: 7.5/10The game has its moments, and those moments are great, and it has some okay moments, it also has the tribal stage......................... as a whole the game is good and worth your time, I reccomendAlso holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ i stopped playing at exactly 42 hours, talk about a coincedence.

The Space Stage is so much fun as a huge conquest you can spend, like, a year working on, but the game lacks awesome content. If it had addons like GMod or varied combat like Warframe this would be great, but it's not amazing. Not for the hardcore gamer for sure. Casual gamers, come have fun!

												DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY, THE SERVERS ARE PERMANENTLY SHUT DOWN.Now that I've said that, I can explain how fun HALF of this game is.Cell stage is a sort of fun indtroductory mini-game more than a full stage. Just imagine alll those games where you eat stuff to get bigger, then eat creatures smaller than you. That's cell stage.The Creature stage is the best part, or maybe second best part, of the game for me. I loved murdering and consuming all of my neighbours and using their limbs to find new parts to evolve. One annoyance, sometimes I couldn't tell where my species had gone when they migrated.Tribal stage is meh. It's kinda fun at the start, until everyone else starts dominating you and you get your food stolen every ten seconds.City stage is boring. More of the same as tribal stage, but with tanks and boats. Get through this stage as fast as possible.Space stage is just as great as Creature stage, if not better. After being confined to one planet for so long, you finally get to build your spaceship and fly to distant star systems. Make friends with aliens, or hunt those in tribal stage for sport. It's great.In conclusion, the first two stages of the game and the last stage are great, but Tribal and City just seem shambled together. Oh, and there's NO ONLINE FUNCTIONALITY. Screw you EA. Pick this game up when it's on sale for a fiver or so.			"

												It might only say I have 0.2 hours on record, but I played this game before I even knew Steam was a thing.Reviled at the time by many for its ""Always-Online"" gimmick that EA would still use for another decade afterward, Spore was a game that promised the literal ""world"" at its first preview showings, but did it deliver?Honestly? No, but that's old history to most people, the game we got was, and still is, in my humble opinion however, a truly unique and creative experience that is paralleled by very few games.The thing that makes Spore stand out, as with most Maxis games like The Sims, is its creativity. The Spore creature creator to this day is still one of the most interesting and in depth character customization mechanics in the gaming world.Whether you want to go with some creepy, or somewhat realistic, or heck even phallic, your imagination is the limit.Each stage of the game is based on a different stage of an organism, Single Celled, Primal, Tribal, ""Civilization"" (Quite literally), and Galactic.You are going to spend the majority of your time in the Galactic phase as it is the proverbial ""End-Game"" to your adventure.If I had to name any cons for the game, I'd say that each stage up to Galactic is fairly shallow, but in all honesty, this is a rather small complaint because although the game boasts having mutliple stages, it's not a ""Civilazation"" game, the stages are a ""means to an end"" so to speak.My favorite stage is the Galactic stage, simply because once you've gotten to this point, you've kind of ""grown"" with your Creature race and Galactic boasts the most features of any of the stages.The Galactic Adventures DLC essentially adds MMO-esque elements to the Galactic Stage, adding in Fetch-Quests, Escort Quests and the ability to get off on alien planets. While this is cool to break up the monotany of space trading and travel every once in awhile, even with community made quests, you are probably going to play the same 3 or 4 over, and over again.Overall, Spore is a game that is very much remembered but often overlooked for how good it really was. 8/10.

Product received for free
												Now, I know this things says I have not played long. True. At least not on steam. I have played this game a TON with the CD version of the game. I love how much creativity you can apply to making your creature. I mean, if you want to give your either cute and lovable creature or your horrifying nightmare-inducing monstrosity a documetary-style description, you can do that! Depending on how you play during each stage of the game can decide what abilities you have to work with for the next, and you can even control this by looking at the evolution history to help you steer toward the path you want to take, whether you want to be a peacful dancing species or be that person who says ""I WILL DESTROY YOU ALL!"" and be completley evil (this is the route i like most). Or you could be both. Theres also that option. You can also throw things at other creatures which can surprise them as well as make them dizzy. Anyway, I highly recomend this game as you can choose how you want to play and know when youre going too far in the opposite direction as well as how fun the game is in general.			"

												I played this game about 30 hours (on the c&c dlc which is counted as stand-alone game on steam), and a bunch more a few years back, but I feel there could be much more to do: if you get deep into the game it will gift you with at least 40-50 hours of gameplay imho.Though the First stages might seem the most original and appealing, you may find out instead the space one isn't odd/dull at all. Once you get used to the sci-fi-like RTS aspects of the 2 last levels you'll realise how fun it is to expand your terrestrial empire first and your cosmic one later on.So to sum up I really loved manipulating the genes to form powerful cells or creatures, and I liked badly to customise my vehicles, citisens and structures (the game really lets you use your skills in architecture and design); but the space stage isn't to be understimated - I promise myself I'll get back to it sometimes as it's the one I played the least.

												Spore may not be what I was expecting. It may not be as good as I thought it could be. But once I looked past the dissappointment, I realised that there is still a good game here.Let me get the things that upset me out of the way. The Creature stage seems to last too long with little variation. You either kill everyone around you, or charm them. And charming is a bit confusing, so it always boils down to me killing off races of animals and watching the progress bar rise ever so slightly each time.Space stage is practically pointless. I feel that there is no goal in it. Sometimes, there are parts of space you can't  get to because they are just a tiny bit too far away. Cell stage was funner than both of these, which is pretty sad. City Stage is too short. It only lasts an hour and a half, at the most. Which sucks, because it's my favorite stage. You get to command vehicles you created to destroy other cities and conquer them. But the biggest danger in City Stage is turrets, not enemy vehicles.That's about it for the things I dislike, so on the the praising for Spore's creativity.CREATING THINGS IS GREAT. They made spinoffs based only on the Spore Creators, and there is a reason for that. You can construct creatures ranging from spiders with dolphin heads to dragons with butterfly wings and a human nose. It's great. The Vehicle Creators are my absolute favorite part of the game. I have created Spaceships of every shape and size, and i am proud of them. You will never see the same ship twice, unless someone actually made a duplicate. I feel like the game would be cooler if more people played and interacted, creating new creatures, buildings (oh yeah, you can create buildings. not my favorite.), and vehicles. But that's just me. Maybe? People, join me, i'm lonely.Spore is not a bad game, as long as you are creative and can deal with a bit of boring gameplay early on. You can create endless creatures, vehicles, and building with endless variety. The Tribal and City stages are fun, but short. good thing you can repeat them any time. I give Spore a 6/10, and I do recommend this game.(this is my first long review) "

												The first thing everyone asks (or should ask) about a game is ""what kind of game is it?"".Spore((tm) is, well, Spore(tm).It doesn't fit into any one genre, apart from possibly sandbox.There's no other game like it.NOTE: Only mouse over spoilers if you feel you can handle mature content.Swear words can make your head explode if you're not careful.When starting my Spore(tm) game, I chose a planet and a difficulty.I chose ""easy"", because I'm a wimp and I'd never played the game before.Asteroids pelted the planet of my choice in a melodramatic armaggedon, making craters and levelling mountains, splashing into the oceans.The camera zoomed in...in...in...it was deep under the ocean...an asteroid cracked open...and a sperm fused with a corn dog (spermdog?) popped out of the asteroid.Oh wait.That's me.I swam around, chomping up algae and chunks of unnameable meat indiscriminately, until I came across a cell far too big to be legally called a cell (you imposter!).It attempted to swallow me in its ginormous mandibles (of which it had far too many), and I could only swim away, flagella wiggling at  top speed.Eventually I got away, and the game told me to ""call a mate"".I did, and my spermdog sent out a little screech, met another spermdog, and got ready for some lovin'.To all you perverts out there: don't get your hopes up, they just dance around and lay an egg.Sexy.I was allowed to make some tweaks to my cell's design.I gave it spikes, a third eye, and an electric butt.He then hatched from an egg cell thing.This went on for a few minutes, until suddenly my triklopticus (for that is what I named him) grew a brain and started wishing for legs.I then advanced to the Creature stage, which consisted of adding legs to an already absurd design, and watched a dozen little leggy spermdogs run up onto dry land.The Creature stage kept the ""mating"" mechanic, but I was now running around on dry land eating stuff and meeting other species.I had the option of making friends with them or eating them.After ten minutes the ground was littered with cute little cadavers.Eventually, the triklopticus developed into beaked scorpion-like creatures with two legs and arms I named the Ornitank.Then they became vaguely humanoid, and when my brain had sufficiently increased in size, I moved on to the Tribe stage and was treated to a cutscene of my Ornitanks discovering fire.I was allowed to give them clothes, because they'd just invented pants, too.This is where the game took on an Age of Empires twist.I had around six tribesmen, all living in a little hut.I could put stuff around the hut and demand that a baby be made (in which case hearts would appear around the hut, an egg would roll out the door, and hatch) and equip my tribesmen with weapons or instruments.I could put them to work hunting or gathering.I made friends with two neighbouring villages, using the power of music, and three attacked me.Three were burnt down.For ever village allied or destroyed, my totem pole got bigger.Before long, my tribesmen were discussing weapons of mass destruction and plotting to take over the world.They grow up so fast *sniff*.I designed buildings to place in my city in such a way as to increase my income and built an armada of tanks, planes, and ships (also custom designed) to conquer other cities.I gave my Ornitanks new clothes that were slightly more ""civilised"" (among the options I could have chosen was a large blonde moustache) and discovered that the Creature Creator had a ""create animated avatar"" option, so I turned my Ornitank citizen into an animated avatar.After conquering the world, the Ornitanks turned their attention to the stars and inexplicably invented a spaceship that could go between the stars and only take a few minutes doing so (the ship, by the way, is customisable, like creatures, vehicles, and buildings).I made first contact with an alien race that ignored my ship, because they were in the middle of some kind of world war.I sucked one of them up in my tractor beam and dropped him off on my homeworld, for in the Space stage, I am a  very responsible starship captain!I found a spacefaring race that was big and pink with one eye and a freaky mouth, who spoke to me in a high-pitched voice and asked me to eliminate the infect Doughball! to gain their allegiance (apparently Doughball! is misspelt without the exclamation mark) and so after missions from the aliens and my own race (one of which was terraforming a planet) I set up a trade route and an alliance.However, my only complaint about the space age is that after the game spends so long increasing the scale, you end up playing as a captain on a random ship.The best part is going down onto planets that aren't spacefaring and just straight-up abducting people.On top of that, you unlock crop circles and can just zap them onto planets.I kept going to Civilization Stage planets and using the crop circle tool to fuel any alien conspiracy theorists that may/may not exist.And that is how you go from spermdog to galactic god in less than three days.

												I dont know if anyone playtested this before release. I dont know if the game will get better if I persevere. I do know that the first two stages of the game are tedious, a boring chore of a game with a superficial cuteness and charm that wears off in minutes. ""I would really like to play a game as a paramecium"" said nobody, ever - except for the developers of Spore apparently.Edit, after playing for a further 6 hours I progressed a few levels. The game did not improve sufficiently to warrant putting up with the previous stages as an amoeba. I think If I kept playing I might develop some form of intellectual impairment. I doubt that this handicap would be severe enough for me to refer to myself using a term for a small group of soldiers.			"

												Let me get this straight, you want me to tell you a review about this game? Whoever you are, you might as well go to the curators, because if you've come for a review on this game, you've come to the wrong place. However, if you have come for an outstanding chocolate chip cookie recipe, you've come to the right place.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ingredients1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter3/4 cup packed dark brown sugar3/4 cup sugar2 large eggs1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract1 (12-ounce) bag semisweet chocolate chips, or chunks2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour3/4 teaspoon baking soda1 teaspoon fine saltDirections1. Evenly position 2 racks in the middle of the oven and preheat to 375 degrees F. (on convection setting if you have it.) Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone sheets. (If you only have 1 baking sheet, let it cool completely between batches.)2. Put the butter in a microwave safe bowl, cover and microwave on medium power until melted. (Alternatively melt in a small saucepan.) Cool slightly. Whisk the sugars, eggs, butter and vanilla in a large bowl until smooth.3. Whisk the flour, baking soda and salt in another bowl. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients with a wooden spoon; take care not to over mix. Stir in the chocolate chips or chunks.4. Scoop heaping tablespoons of the dough onto the prepared pans. Wet hands slightly and roll the dough into balls. Space the cookies about 2-inches apart on the pans. Bake, until golden, but still soft in the center, 12 to 16 minutes, depending on how chewy or crunchy you like your cookies. Transfer hot cookies with a spatula to a rack to cool. Serve.5. Store cookies in a tightly sealed container for up to 5 days.For a Rocky Road Bar:1. Lightly butter a 9 by 13-inch baking pan. Make the batter as per cookie recipe and fold in 1 cup chopped walnuts along with the chocolate chips. Spread batter in prepared pan. Bake until the edges are light brown and the batter sets, about 45 minutes. Cool slightly and cover surface with 4 cups marshmallows and 1 cup chocolate chips. Broil at least 8 inches from the heat until marshmallows turn golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Keep an eye on the marshmallows, and turn the pan frequently--they go from golden to char in a wink.) Cool, cut and serve.			"

												I like game, but beware EA didn't put a whole lot of effort into this game and it crashes rampantly. I highly suggest you save very often or else you'll end up like me and be into the tribal stage when your game crashes and whisks away all your progress down the drain. EA dropped the ball so much that apparently there isn't even an autosave function. This game crashes so much and personally i don't think I'll ever be playing it again. The game itself is very fun as you get to guide the evolution of your species from a single cellular organization all the way to space faring god. EA made a lot of promises about this game that they didn't deliver. So pretty much standard EA behavior.Pros:+ Engaging gameplay+ Enjoyable & somewhat diverse scenarios+ Diversity among creature creations+ Looks good for something made in 2008+ Lots of unique body parts to chose from+ Species specialization (e.g. carnivore, omnivore, herbivore)+ Different creatures/species have different ""voices"" (diversity of creature communications)+ Decent job explaining functions of everthing through all stagesCons:- Stages of evolution rather short- Space stage the longest stage (Dispropotionate compared to other stages)- Cannot continue to gain the evolution points to unlock body parts once you complete a stage- Only real option once completing a stage is advancing the evolution- Rather odd taking over planets in Space stage with your single ship- Actually rather odd doing everthing in the Space stage from your single ship- Rampant crashes- No autosave feature- Very few save slots for different worlds- Too few stages of evolution- Almost zero interaction available during Space stage with nonspace faring civilizations			"

												This game is too quick in terms of progression from cellular organism to space-faring creature. Once you get to space, it's the same shake-and-bake colony making: find planet suitable for life, terraform, colonize, and... do it all over again!In other words, once you get to the ""end-game"" portions of the game, it ends up being very repetitive and boring. Given that EA's servers for the game are also apparently dead, and there being no Steam Workshop at the time of this writing, you don't get to share with others.Basically, the game's missing key features now, there's no support for it, and the DLC content where your space captain goes on adventures is so clunky and buggy, I can't recommend this game anymore.If the game is ever on sale, it might be worth picking up if you've never played it before. Don't get me wrong; the game is fun, it's just that the fun doesn't last after you've done 2 or 3 civilizations.The verdict: this game might be worth $5 if you find yourself playing with character creation screens way too long. Otherwise, spend your hard-earned cash elsewhere.			"

												[Clocked in only 5 hours because I transferred to the galactic launcher but finished my first playthrough using only Spore features not galactic ones]It's a very enjoyable game especially if you love civilization games. Here you start as a freakin single celled organism.What I love with the early stages of the game is that your creature evolves from that single celled organism to whatever the ♥♥♥♥ you want to go with until tribal age.I must say tribal stage up to space age the game changed for me, you stopped evolving and instead start using clothes.Spage Age I must say is pretty freakin huge!!! So huge I can't explore it all and that's just a single galaxy.As you go further in your own civilization you notice less and less species surround you (extiction is common even in outer space because of sentient beings being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥Recommendations:You should grab Galactic Adventures expansion as it becomes bland after exploring different sectors.If you want the online feature to work, put the game product code you have on steam (you can get it on the CD key of your game [library->games->spore->CD key]) and put it on origin (Origin->add game->put the product code). (there's not much with the online feature though)Regret:I didn't get to kill humans!			"

												This game is amazing. It sparked my creativity when I was young and still finds a way to inspire me today - this game is awesome.I have bought this game about 3 times.Once when the game came out, another after moving houses and losing the CD, and finally (the latest purchase) on Steam. I have countless hours on this game (I mostly play Creepy and Cute DLC; so it wont be showing many hours here).I would recommend to everyone. Especially any parents who want to kick-start their child's creativity.PROS:- Goofy, funny, and entertaining game.- Hours of gameplay and replayability.- Simple and easy to learn controls.- Teaches how civilizations begin and develop (in terms simple enough for youngsters to learn)- Teaches basic biology.- Allows anyone to develop and/or increase their creativity.- Many references to sci-fi movies.- Made by the legend himself: WILL WRIGHT.

												I realy like spore, I think that the game mechanics are great. I know very little programming, but enough to know that this game must have taken forever in develupment for it to get to this point. I played a long time ago before it was for steam, and I liked it, but I was very little and I never made it past the creature stage. I do very much enjoy this game, and I hope that it gets updated will small updates frequently sometime in the future.			"

												This game is amazing. It sparked my creativity when I was young and still finds a way to inspire me today - this game is awesome.I have bought this game about 3 times.Once when the game came out, another after moving houses and losing the CD, and finally (the latest purchase) on Steam. I have countless hours on this game (I mostly play Creepy and Cute DLC; so it wont be showing many hours here).I would recommend to everyone. Especially any parents who want to kick-start their child's creativity.PROS:- Goofy, funny, and entertaining game.- Hours of gameplay and replayability.- Simple and easy to learn controls.- Teaches how civilizations begin and develop (in terms simple enough for youngsters to learn)- Teaches basic biology.- Allows anyone to develop and/or increase their creativity.- Many references to sci-fi movies.- Made by the legend himself: WILL WRIGHT. (Bless his soul)- $15CONS:- May turn your child into a creative freak. Just saying. - No longer supports online functions (from what I know)- The last stage of the game; Space Stage, can be a little overwhelming for youngsters.Bonus con:- No Spore 2 :(			"

												I've played the game for, I think, 1000 hours when I was younger, but on a non-Steam-version. I've never had the DLCs.Now I bought Spore and all it's DLCs on Steam-Sale and started to play again. It's such a great game, but also has some flaws. The idea of Spore is AMAZING!But sadly in some stages, the developers didn't put enough effort in it. I think the most developed stage is the last one, where you can travel the whole galaxy. It's amazing how big the galaxy is and I loved terraforming planets to make them able to be inhabited by creatures or to enlarge my empire. I've also always tried to get friends of the Grox (biggest empire in the Space-stage), or even trying to beat them (I've never beaten them, it's too difficult...)The second most developed stage is the second one, where you can develop you own creature, communicate with other ones and explore the planet. The other stages, I have to admit, are a little short, especially the first one, where you are only a cell. It's so much fun to create species, there are many body-parts and many possibilities to combine and even more with the DLC ""Creepy and Cute"". But Sometimes you wish for even more body-parts, maybe some more exciting, or that there are other possibilities for putting them on you species. For example, making things bigger, having scarier mouths, and beeing able to put more parts on your species body than you are allowed now. That's why there are many mods, that make the creating of species much more interesting and sooo great. Go to Youtube and serach for ""Spore creations"" and you'll know what I mean. I'd love to see a Spore 2 where all those flaws are fixed and the developers really put effort in. Many people would probably buy this because they had so much fun with the first one. But sadly after, I think, 9 years, they probably won't develop a Spore 2 and we have to keep playing the fist game. Even though Spore is not the newest game anymore, you should give it a try, because it really can be fun.			"

												Spore is an interesting, different take on the classic god-type genre of games. You begin as a single cell organsim, happily eating (plants or other organisms, or both!) and eventaully running away or fighting other organisms. As you eat, you gain DNA, which is used to modify your creature, from eyes to appendages used to attack others or defend yourself, and other some modifications that do not require DNA, such as enlarging or reducing the size and shape of your creature, enlongating or shortening your spine, even individual segments of your spine! After you consume enough DNA, you will be able to ""find a mate"" and change anything you like about your creature, including color, color patterns and layers of color and patterns, and anything else you can imagine. Really, the whole point that Spore really drives home is that your creations are only limited by your imagination. Once enough DNA and parts are gathered you can ""evolve"" to the next stage of evolution, in this case, evolving legs. Once you crawl out of the primordial soup and make landfall, you will have a nest for your species to stay in, and the real adventure begins. You will meet other species and decide if you want to befriend them through either ""Impressing"" them through song and dance and whatnot, or kill them into extinction. In the next stage of evolution you have a third option to send them gifts, which they may or may not accept. Each decision you make affects the outcome of your creature. Befriending tribes gives you abilities to make it easier to befriend other species in the future, as does killing them, or gifting, the economic solution. Whenever you successfully befriend, or kill a species, you will be rewarded with new parts to help evolve your creature. Many of these at this stage have actual benefits, such as arms with hands that have sharp claws, which will aid you in taking down some of the tougher species, or other parts that boost your ability to sing, dance and otherwise impress other species. As with the previous stage, once you have collected enough DNA through befriending or conquering species, you will advance to the next stage of evolution, Tribal. (NOTE: When you finish creature stage, before you advance to tribal stage you will be given one last chance to change your creature in any way you see fit. Once you enter tribal stage, NO MORE CHANGES CAN BE MADE TO YOUR CREATURE.)The tribal stage is arguably the most difficult stage because you really have to begin managing your resources. You have to gather food to feed your tribe, and plenty extra if you plan on gifting to other tribes. You have a village and as with the previous stage, instead of parts, you have buildings in your village that will assist your tribe in your goal. At this point it is a good idea to settle on whether you plan on being a war-mongering military society, a happy-go-lucky religious society (you still sing and dance to befriend other tribes, but in the next stage you basically convert new species to your religion in order to become allies) or an economic powerhouse (in the near future, capable of purchasing entire star systems). Once you have  enough allies or conquor enough tribes, you advance to the next stage, Civilization.Civilization stage is much like the creature stage, in that it opens up the game into a new level of depth and this time, micro-management. You will discover Spice, the source of all income, and mine the various spice gysers near and far to increase your income (which replaces DNA) and go crazy with creation. Much like your original creature, you can choose from a preset list from Maxis, or if you signed in at the beginning of the game (or at any time for that matter) you can use or modify any creation by any person who has played Spore. Of course, you can also create your own from the ground up, including a Town  Hall, a Factory, Houses, and Entertainment buildings. You can use these in city planning to create a well-balanced city. Too many factories will boost spice processing, but make your city unhappy and easily susceptible to religious attacks, which are much more effective against unhappy cities. Too many entertainment buildings will make your city happy, but your spice production will suffer. You will learn the proper balance with time, experiment and try different things, which is what Spore is all about! Anyway the objective of this stage is to destroy or ally yourself with other rival factions of your species, which has become the single most dominant sentient creature on your planet. Of course you can also establish trade routes with rival cities and eventually be given the option to purchase them, making them as much yours as a city you started with. Again, eventually you will destroy or ally yourself with all the rival factions on your planet, and advance to the final stage, Space.This is by far and away the most fun stage in the game, and once you reach space stage with one species, you can start a new species at any stage (Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization, or Space) any time you wish. Your species has advanced enough to begin space flight! From this point, the universe is your oyster! The same ways you haved allied yourself, purchased, or conquered others until now remain the same, although, remember that at least in the beginning of space stage, your species exists on but one planet, whereas other species you meet will be spread across several planets and even start systems! If you want an accurate scope of just how huge this game is, zoom out from your planet, to your start system, complete with other planets, to your local star system cluster to eventually the entire galaxy. Every start system, every planet you see you can visit! You can establish colonies on new worlds to expand your empire, meet new species and decide how to deal with them, do missions for them, hunt for valuable artifacts, and even terraform planets from T0 (No atmosphere, very difficult to sustain a profitable colony) to a T3 oasis, with several booming colonies, ripe for the picking with all different kinds of Spice! From this point you can do whatever, go wherever, whenever you want!All in all, if you like creative freedom, an explorative nature, and want to build your own galaxy spanning empire from a single celled organism to the most powerful species in the galaxy, this game is for you! (On a side note, Spore and Spore Creepy and Cute Parts Pack are completely compatible with Windows 8.1)			"

												EA and Origin accounts made since 2013 DO NOT connect to spore. User created content is unviewable. EA knows about this and has been sitting on this since July of this year. You also cannot create a new account.Of course I didn't know about that til after the fact, at least you can be an informed consumer.EDIT:Was directed to a forum post to fix the issues I was having. It worked! http://steamcommunity.com/app/17390/discussions/0/490123938445529635/#p2Kudos to KoolAidtheRedDespite that, it doesn't excuse EA making things extremely difficult not only to find out what is wrong, but getting around to fixing it. In the end I'd say go ahead and get this game if you only want half the functionality or if you have the tech-savy to fix it.			"

												All i have to say is this game is more for creative people/ If you want a lot of progression or some kind of rpg type of game this isn't for you (only the creature stage is like that). This game is for people who want to keep coming up with creative creatures and people who like to play things in different ways (evolution paths).This is not supposed to be a professional review but this is just to warn people who aren't very creative or have a hard time playing things more than once to try new ways to play. One thing i will admit though is this game is hard to play just for fun or having a variety of things to do and can get pretty boring.			"

												In the pitiful technical state this game is in, I can not recommend it. The early game phases and the creature creator might be nice and all, but it doesn't help that the game has a tendence of crashing whenever a cutscene plays. Of course, one could regularily save the game, but at least in my case, the game doesn't actually save my progress and always resets to the same point. Add to that EAs more than doubtful business practices (the bundle costing more than the combined cost of it's contents), and you got a mess if there ever was one.			"

But.... it's EA.. I should've known better to think it was really given any REAL effort.One mistake, I'll admit, was my own.  I didn't realize that the game didn't have any autosaving, and you had to save manually.  So when the game crashed, I lost every bit of the game that I'd been playing.Of course, the fact that having my internet go out for a few seconds caused the game to crash... I hadn't expected that to happen.   Nor did I expect to have to create an origin account for the game.   Nor did I expect to have to spend a half an hour getting it to reset my password because every time it accepted a password when I tried to login it said invalid password. ((luckily I was finally able to get a password that worked by saying something derogatory to the company in it.. they had no problem letting that go through it seems, just not a NORMAL password)).  Nor did I expect to have to reboot my entire computer just to be able to log into their servers.   The issues are plenty, and now that I've already spent money on it, I've seen quite a few other people on the net that have had problems with it crashing.   Is the game good?   Sure, it can be fun.   But seeing as how EA infrastructure and coding can destroy just about anything.. well.. good luck if you decide to try it.   I hope you have better luck than I.			"

												This game is full of dissapointment. So much of this game is spent doing a task over and over again until you can get the the ""cool part"". The space section of the game is the only moderately fun part but it still controls bad and is random if you start in a good part of the galaxy with good neighbors. Play something else, anything else.			"

												I had to repurchase the game just to own it. Spore is not what it was orignally marketed as. It became repurposed as a child's game with sandbox elements and a casual pacing. However, the overall gameplay is relaxing and enjoyable if not a little bit juvenile. It's basically a set of minigames and the space age, which is semi interesting. Overall, it's a fun, worthwhile experince if Spore is on sale for super cheap and you have some spare time. I enjoyed the game as a child, and perhaps that is who would get the most enjoyment out of this game.			"

												Didn't really bother with the online stuff since it's an old game and the servers are probably down.  Having said that loaded up the game started from the begining and was actually impressed I've seen the gameplay for spore a few times never played it myself until now.  Only encountered a small bug where my campsite vanished had to walk out of the area and then back in to fix it.  I say wait for this to be on sale like I did unless you know you want to play spore from 8 pm til 2 am.			"

The trailer is interestingly funny and awesome. Create the future of your single species (No pun intended), And simulate the creator of all things in a universe, Be their ""god"" that guides the existence on a planet.

												SPORE is quite an old game now but that doesn't stop people from loving this game. The Game is based around a planet where you develop an alien species from a single celled organism, you go from the simple forms in the tide pool to a powerful tribe after that you'll find yourself thriving in the city/ civilisation stage.Pro's- thousands of other species to befreind and kill- hundreds of custom parts to build your creature- Big worlds to exploreCon's - can get repetitive after a while7/10 - Good Game "

												REVISED 4/13/14: Spore does have a few hinderances. One great example would be the massive amount of bugs in the game, whether they be subtle or game-breaking. But let's try to ignore those. Spore is a brilliant game, in fact, I love Spore. It has a great cult following communtiy, too. In my opinion, the best stage is the space stage. Really, I like all the stages (except tribal because you can't use cheats :P). I would reccomend this game to casual and hardcore gamers, as it amounts to so much fun.			"

												Spore is one of the best God Simulators out there. It gives you full control over your creature. Over the very skeleton and skin cells of it. If there were 1000 people playing the game at the same time, you can be sure their creatures will be totally unique. You start as a simple cell. Whether carnivore or herbivore (or omnivore). A few million years later you develop legs and hands. You get a better mouth and eyes, and nose. You become who you want to become. You can have 10 eyes and 4 noses, 6 hands and 1 leg, while your mouth is positioned on your knee. You can do literally anything. There are lots of stages in your creature's life. You become the leader of a tribe. And then you lead a whole civilization. Later you go on the adventure on conquering the endless space with it's magnificent sights. Creative people must play this. It's amazing how complex and beautiful a creature can get. Especially when you remember that you started from a simple cell.10/10 "

												6/10 - ""Evolution"" of Gaming. =)This concept is really cool. Start as a single cell organism and combine or irradicate others to evolve. This is an open world. Once you develope your creatures build and attributes then the game becomes a strategy based game. Worth $5! Wish it continued with the open world sandbox and didn't convert to strategy.

I bought it to my girlfreind at the same time on steam and her game have no issue at all on steam ( but she have an OLD Pc )You have a good PC ? install it on Origin.*******************************************************EDIT********************************************************These are the good points of buying it on steam ( actually 12 $ for the game and the two expensions ) and INTALLING IT on Origin ( use the cd key given by steam via : Right clic on the game/ View CD Key) and add it to your Origin Library.- Do not bug whit ''good'' Pc ( better than a 2008 one)- You can acces the online data ( creatures from other players in your world and more )- You can acces the patch and news- You can have a very good support from the EA team ( if you want to chat online you have to select United-states in the web site )			"

												Um dos melhores jogos de simulação que já joguei. Joguei muito mesmo quando criança (ele é um pouquinho ""old"" , mas é gold, certeza). Em comparação a outros jogos, ele tem uma temática diferente. Segue a teoria da Evolução, em que você cria um ser vivo e de tempos em tempos ele desenvolve habilidades e suas proles nascem mais inteligentes. Porém Spore é divido em uma espécie de estágios, em que você simula coisas diferentes daquela espécie que você criou (estágios em que você é só uma pobre célula dependente e vivente na água, depois você já se adapta à terra, depois tem uma família, uma população toda  e por fim um planeta - sim você brinca com a galáxia- ). Com Spore você não fica naquela ""mesmisse"" o tempo todo como The Sims ( e sim, é da mesma empresa desenvolvedora Maxis). Bom, para não ficar com uma descrição muito subjetiva, segue abaixo um vídeo perfeitamente explicativo. Ele te toma meia horinha mas tenha paciência, porque vale a pena (a não ser que você realmente não goste do gênero). Por fim, é um jogo divertidíssimo, fácil de mexer e gostoso de jogar (com deliciosos efeitos sonoros e uma rotação de câmera divina -não que isso seja muita coisa).Divirta-se e brinque com a Genética do Darwin  :3

												This game offers fun gameplay for the first couple hours but then gets stale because of how many times this game crashes.  Spore is not worth the $20 that its sold for.  If you plan on buying the game regardless of this review, wait for a sale.  Have fun making Creatures that were made in the Spore creature creator.			"

												Well. The game is good, but it has lots of promblems with virtual key, steam expansions don't work properly. If you want, you'd better buy it in Orign. But I'd better get a refund. (Argh! U can also s.t.e.a.l it on rutacker.Argh!, but this is UNfair)			"

												It was a great game in its prime, but since EA stopped giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the entire project, Maxis died, and no one actually patches the game anymore - many game-breaking glitches will erase all of your progress in a snap (as Autosaves simply don't exist in game.)I don't reccomend the game whatsoever in its current state, but I certainly would have 3 years ago. Get it while on sale for when it's less than 10 dollars, but otherwise - stay far away. $20 is a lot to pay for something that barely runs on any Modern PC.It's a huge shame, too. Back when it was still being updated and cared about by the developers, Spore was possibly one of the best creature-based games you could get.			"

IF however you wish like any person, which to create a galactic empire and control all the planets its impossible. The only problem is a limited amount of bodyparts, colors and parts that can be used and there is no way to allow for more to be added like on steam workshop.Its worth a buy if its on sale.			"

												Update! Got Spore to work with Steam now. So ignore hours played here. I've well over 600+ hours with this game since it's release quite some time ago.So Spore is a God game of sorts, which would be ironic considering it focuses mostly on evolution for what should be the meat of the game. Depending on how you play however, it can still be a good chunk. Starting off from a tiny organism in the primordial soup, you work your way up through the food chain by consuming matter and gaining points to evolve new parts to make you more dangerous, defensive or the alpha being in the micro world. Eventually you gain the ability to have the very basic instincts of a sentient creature, growing legs and walking onto land where you proceed to evolve as before in a much larger world. From there you eventually gain a higher thought process and begin displaying the ability to form a cohesive society capable of thinking. From there you move through what's something of a crude cross between an RTS and several janky game mechanics to befriend or defeat other tribes which appear in the world. Eventually moving on to be the dominant species and begin warring with other nations which spring up. You've several ways to dominate the planet, truth be told, the mechanics behind conquering the world are the same for any path really.And then onto the true meat of the game. Space exploration, terraforming new worlds, meeting new space empires and either kill, conquer or buy worlds from them. And then, the steam for this game begins to die down and the fun train slows substantially. Sure, at first exploring the stars is fun, but after awhile it can begin to become more of a chore to hop around space, meeting certain goals and milestones to improve your ship and empire and defending against aggressive or downright hostile space beings. I will say though, it took a long time, but your ultimate goal is to reach the center of the galaxy. I won't say what you find of course, so the truly curious will have to find their way there or just look it up online like a panzy.Now as for the different stages of evolving a creature, a bit more in depth.Just to note, as you progress through the stages you can choose different paths such as herbivore and carnivore which then translate into other catagories later in the game such as industrious, warlord or peaceful. All of which give some special abilities in the tribal, civilization and space stages and also effect how your creatures evolve in what parts are available in evolution.The first two stages, cell and creature, are fairly similar in mechanics in terms of gaining DNA to evolve. The cell stage is very simple, depending on your difficulty, but typically isn't hard to get through at all. Then the creature stage which uses the same mechanics of the cell stage, but on land and much more three dimensional. The game is a bit silly in how to befriend other creatures, using silly but amusing mechanics. Combat is essentially two animals clawing at each other until one or the other is dead. This is where you begin really planning your creatures evolution a bit more. You can shape it's torso, head and any other appendage to your liking, making everything from humanoid bipedal creatures or a giant♥♥♥♥♥♥♥hopping around. Whatever floats your boat or finds your lost remote, weirdo.When it comes to interacting with the world, whether it's combat or communication, it functions quite a bit like an MMO actually. You click where you want to go or use the typical WSAD keys to move around. Hotkeys, 1234 and such will perform actions depending on what you're doing with small cooldown timers. When moving on after you've gotten enough DNA, the camera mechanics and interactions perform roughly the same for the Tribal stage. This is probably the shortest stage there is. You can easily and quickly defeat or befriend other tribes and chances are it'll take about thirty or forty minutes. Operates the same with hotkeys and movement, but more like a badly formed RTS where you can move units around to collect resources and the such.Next is the Civilization stage which is pretty bland to tell the truth. You can design your own land, water and air vehicles in just about whatever fashion you see fit. In terms of conquering, they're all pretty much the same except for trade which allows you to peacefully buy other civilizations land, but to some extent works on the same mechanics. Then you get to the true meat of the game. SPACE. And at first it's pretty amazing with how massive of a galaxy you have to explore. You'll meet a handful of different species near you, explore different planets and stars that you've seen in the sky since you first crawled onto land.Terraforming, now there's a thing. At first it's pretty neat, slowly shaping a world to sustain life, plopping plants and animals to create a stable ecosystem so you can build colonies to populate new worlds. Along with colonizing you can collect a substance found on many planets called Spice. In this time, the most precious substance in the universe is the spice. The spice extends life. The spice expands conciousness. The spice is vital to space travel. Actually, no it's just a valuable trading commodity of different colors and rarity. You can trade spices between different systems and eventually, in most cases, be able to buy the system and aquire new planets to claim as your own.Now things start to sort of fall apart when it comes to advancing. For a bit all these things are a bit of fun and in short bursts, it can be. However after awhile the game becomes tedious and more of a task. The expansion for the game, Galactic Adventures, does add a fairly decent amount to do, but comes across as excessively cheesy and hokey, though I imagine the target audience was a bit younger than most of the people actually playing the game or somebody at Maxis and/or EA was smoking the dank and watching far to many kids shows on Saturday morning. But a fair amount, if not almost half of other missions aren't so bad and involve a combat system which reflects what you would have experience back in the creature stage. Just with lasers and such. It does make for a less tedious but slower method to obtain Sporebucks, though you eventually reach the point where expanding your civilization, which requires massive amounts of Sporebucks to upgrade your ship. Keep it up though and this grind isn't to bad, but then you're left with even less goals to pursue as you look forward to the tedious journey to the center of the galaxy.Oh right, your ship. Almost forgot. So you get to design a space ship of any design at the beginning of the Space stage. It doesn't matter what parts you put on it, as your ships abilities, defences and other functions are unlocked in other ways. So the design is purely aesthetic. Controls are the WSAD setup with your cursor acting as a point of aiming. Combat is usually fairly simple and becomes somewhat routine after awhile. Once you upgrade your ship enough though, combat becomes hardly a challenge and becomes more of a management thing in simply making sure your ship stays fueled and powered up.There's not much else to say here. I will note, I remember this game being hyped up beyond belief and being a great letdown to a lot of people. I didn't feel all that disapointed, but felt there was a much greater goal this game could have accomplished rather than slowly fizzling out in its gameplay late game. I'm sure some people find the tasks entertaining for a long time, but I've found it's better in short bursts in the late game, as just about everything else can be done in a matter of six to ten hours.So is this game with the expansions worth $40(USD)? That's a shaky yes. But if you're not willing, wait for a sale. With that, I am about to hit the maximum amount of characters available to write a rev--			"

												I absolutely recommend this game.  I've had it since it came out and I still come back to play it.  It has more replay value than any game I've ever played before.  if you try it and don't like the first stage, then keep playing.  One of the stages is bound to catch your interest.The online material is gone now.  However, if you invite a few people over to make their own creations in your game it will have about the same effect.			"

												This game was my childhood back when it was popular (Rip Spore community), it will always be my favourite game. You can play god and create your own creatures and play as them through the Cell Stage (Your creature begins its story as a cell in the water), then to Creature Stage (Your creature evolves and grows legs, moves onto the land and becomes either a killing machine or a friendly diplomatic species), to Tribal Stage (Your creature discovers fire and learns to use tools, and thus begins the Tribal Stage where you have to either fight or befriend other tribes to evolve), to Civilization Stage (Your creature's species evolves to the Civilization Stage which is pretty much modern today, much like tribal stage, you must either befriend or destroy every other Civilization on the planet to evolve, but this time you will have a Navy, Airforce, ect), and finally the Space Stage (Yourr creature's species evolves into the Space Stage, the most complicated stage but in my opinion the most enjoyable stage in the game, you have the ENTIRE Galaxy to explore with over 100 other alien Empires to either go to war with, or befriend and trade with. But then once you approach the center of the Galaxy, you encounter an Empire so vicious and deadly they could simply conqure the entire Galaxy with ease if they wanted to, so beware...). The DLC for this game add amazing new content that will improve your game, Galactic Adventures is the best one though ;). On steam i have about 3 hours of playtime with Spore, but at the time i had the game and DLC on disc, and i eventually got them on steam when i recently lost my spore game cases.Rip Maxis			"

												Spore may be hard to use at first, such as making your first creature or the actual gameplay itself. But, the controlls and functions of the game will be easy to use once you play long enough. It was a true adventure of leading your creature towards the top of its existance and inventing new technologies. Creating creatures was difficult for me since the backbone of the being was hard to work off of. Later I got the hang of using the creature creator to where they look like normal beings. For this game you need allot of patience, imagination and somewhat skill to advance or just to experiment your gameplay story. I would very recommend this game if you were looking to buy it. Worth the money.			"

												After finally feeling I have put in enough time to review this game I want to go a bit in depth. first let's look positive: on the plus side the cell stage made me nostalgic for the eat and row games I played as a young child. The creature stage I found thoroughly fun and enjoyable. The combat is quite simplistic and easy to navigate if your on a full red streak. Befriending creatures was fluid as well but I haven't done all that much. The user interface I found nice and friendly and had no troube navigating menus. The space stage made me feel quite free and I loved it but it definitely had its bad points.The negatives now: the space stage was too long and I ended up choosing a planet not on looks but on what was closest to the centre, it also suffers from bad combat, a huge difficulty spike and monotony. The civ stage was too restrictive and I found boring and I won't go into the god awful village stage.Overall I really enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend it to friends especially if it's cheap it still holds up great and you can be so so creative with it if you have the money buy it for sure.

												I play this game all the time and it never ever gets boring.My friends and I enjoy competeing to see who can make the most creepiest or cutest creature. Anyways about the game,Spore is a very fun and creative game to play.Many achevments can be unlocked and you can even set you own goals.The game is more on the lines of solo than multiplayer,but it would be cool if you could visit other people's planets and creatures.The game is basically a great game where you can create you own creatures and make them go through evolotion.Their are alot of pros I can think of but thankfully not many cons.Here are some:Pros:1. Very positive2. Entertaining3. Creative4. Never ends (As in their are no limits to how many creatures,planet,or games you can make.)Cons:1. Addicting2. Not multiplayer (Although I'm hoping it will be in the future.) Well there are the pros and cons of the game Spore! I hop you found this review useful if you are interested in the game.And if you do buy it and try it,I hope you will enjoy it as much as I do!			"

												I actually like this game quite a bit, honestly, though mostly for Nostalgia reasons and the Creature Builder specificallyGood Parts- you can make aliens of your own design and casually Play God- It's pretty cute - the graphics aren't super realistic and thus haven't suffered too bad with aging, at least aesthetically- This might just be a personal thing bcs I'm a sucker for worldbuilding/storywriting but it's fun to sort of evolve your little alien dude(s) into an empire and like,,, make up their history based on what happens- This game is actually moddable, though be warned bcs it involves dropping files Directly into the game's data folder and you can't share creations made with modded parts- It's also kinda fun to just poke around w/ the data sometimes and mess around w/ the Startup Conditions to unlock Hidden Developer Creators (the Flora and Cell Editors, for example)Bad Parts- It gets really, really repetitive after a while- A lot of people (myself included) have a hard time getting the graphics to actually 'function' and register that you've set them on 'High' - I suspect this is because this game is from like just before the 2010's so it might not know how to run on modern hardware. There's a mod/fix for this somwhere if you go googling but i haven't gotten it to work- There's quite a few bugs but *most* of the major game breaking ones have been fixed for ages.- I have no idea if the Steam version of this has the DRM that it started with - if it does this is a Very Bad Part- The online function is ♥♥♥♥ed on the Steam version - you have to register the game with Origin to get it to go online (though fortunately you do NOT have to buy it again - just register the CD key into it and you're good. You also don't have to bother w/ Origin after this and can never touch it again)Despite the negatives outweighing the positives, I'm still gonna mark this as Recommended as it's a pretty fun game I feel.EDIT TO ADD I'd still wait for it to be on sale to buy it - it's an Alright game but $20 USD for the base game + the DLC is quite a lot and when it's on sale it averages to $15 USD for all three items.

												This game is one of the best I have ever played, not only is there infinite customization, each stage is a different type of gameplay, first level (cell) is somewhat like feeding frenzy or agar.io, the land creature stage is a third person adventure gameplay, tribal stage is a strategy game such as age of empires, national stage is like Civ V or most other strategy games, and the final stage (space) is more of an open world, infinite exploration, conquer the galaxy kind of game. Overall, no matter what kind of game you like, you will most likely enjoy Spore.10/10 would conquer universe again			"

												Spore is super fun, my favorite stage is the creature stage because you're so small in a huge world! Tons of creative creatures created by other people can be in YOUR world! My favorite part about it is the creature making, its so fun to make creatures with 4 heads or 8 arms, This is definetly a favorite of mine. Exploring the unknown, fighting, making friends, and evolving! this is an excelent game for all ages, brilliant.			"

												As long as you're not expecting a very serious game, this game is great.   It has a variety of modes/stages to play in, starting as a basic Cell, evolving through an early creature stage through to a large space-faring species, with the fate of the galaxy in your, seemingly the only capable hands in the entire galaxy.  It is very light-hearted sort of story, even the biggest villains in the universe aren't that bad, and the game itself doesn't take itself very seriously.  The Creators are pretty robust if you have a good imagination, you could create an entire species that looks like Bart Simpson, or ships that look like giant butterflies, very close to anything you want.

												Spore is a very good game. However in the space stage spore gets quite monotonous and boring with the inability to change your characters and space ship. you just make friends or enemies while replying to requests for help to try and keep your ally ships. the stage I liked best was the creature stage. I hope there is an update to make everything more creature stage style.			"

												A long time ago I dreamt of getting this game as a kid, so many years later I finally got my hands on it and it's even more fun than I expected.  Getting to see your creation evolve from a single cell all the way to a galactic ruler is truly a special experience.  I also find that there is a lot of replay value in this game, I always come back to see what kind or route or creature I can make this time.  If you have an active imagination begging to be let loose on a sandbox world and are willing to challenge yourself to work around the constraints nature has placed on you, then this is the game for you.  Even if you're looking for a more relaxing time, there's an evolutionary stage for everyone.  Keep in mind I have no idea what this game was supposed to be and am only judging it from what I got.  Could this game have turned out better?  Yes.  Is it still fun? Yes. Is it worth the price?  Yes.			"

												This game was awesome right when I started playing it. You start out as a little cell and the gameplay it much like agario in this stage.Then you evolve and grow legs so you can walk the earth in this stage you can either find Parts by roaming the world of extincting a species or allying with them.There is three different ways you can go.You can either be a Herbivore,Omnivore,or a carnivore.The way you pick will effect you for the rest of the game because it gives you special abilitias depending on what you are.Then there is the tribal stage, The tribal stage is where you command you tribe to go and destroy or ally with another village, Either way you pick it will give you either new tools,weapons,or instruments.Then there is the civilization stage where you get to make tanks,ships,and airships. Then either capture,destroy,or ally with all the other cities, you can also send tanks and ships to collect spice. Then there is my personal favorite stage the space stage.In the space stage you upgrade you ship,go through the galaxy allying,fighting, or capturing entire colonies and planets.There is also a species called the Grog that do not trust people.You can also have more than one world.

												I wish the game was longer or more complex. Or harder. I'd really love it if you could only make a few changes at any time. Being able to completely change your monster EVERY. SINGLE. TIME is AWFUL.It's a fun game, but it really needs to be taken to a higher level to be what it should have been.I'd be willing to buy into a hard-choices, slow-develepment, restrictive version of this game. By all means, tie-in a creature builder...I don't care about that, but I want the development of my species to be HARD AND PAINFUL.Pros: Easy to useEasy to pick upEasy to win.Allows for maximum creativeity at any point in your developmentCons:So easy that it's got very little replayability, which is nonsense.No natural flow of development - you can delete your character and just make a new one every time you breed.no restrictions that make it FEEL like you're evolving a creature or their cultureNo 'hard mode'.Conclusion:Better for kids with no patience. Anyone with the remotest amount of patience can DESTROY this game without effort.			"

												Started off as a cell that only ate small peices of meat, just nimble cells trying to stay alive in this world. Got to land, evolved into a spider mixed with a scorpion creature that I like to call ""Stenhi"", striaght outta of Compton. Befriend other species and live in a fluffy teletubby land of peace and happiness, or eradicate them all to the last man, woman, and kindergarten teacher? Murder them all. Why? Because the snake gods demanded blood sacrifices and its not like we were gonna argue. Now enterd the civiliation era, Stenhi with huge tanks and helicopters that served as mobile bases of muderering and oppression. Mostly murderering. Other civiliations not under my rule? I immediately took control, by blowing up everything. Order was mine, citys only filled with houses and factories, no entertainment of any sort, besides The Jackson 5, I was ruling with order. The Stenhi had ruled the planet with order and communism. They had eventually invented the space ship, they soared the stars, met new people. We traded and did missions for them. Then in the end, we murdered each colony, one by one. ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" -Gary Coleman  Order and communism, all throught the galaxy, I don't know what's to come next, but if anything, we'll just murder it.Oh and I almost forgot, 10/10.

												Simply put: this game contains nearly endless amounts of character customization, and that is why I continue to come back to it over and over. Let your imagination be your guide. You can literally spend 100% of your playing time (like I often do, myself) just designing a multitude of different creatures, vehicles (land, sea, and space) and buildings as well. The game reminded me a lot of Black and White, which I used to play near-obessively when I was younger. There's more to the game than just customization and character design, of course. Following the evolutionary story mode itself presents all sorts of interesting scientific, biological, and sociological mechanics. As a gamer, it's the ultimate sense of creative control to supervise and influence a creature's growth and development, along with all the cultural and societal changes that go along with it. It's just so enthralling to raise a creature from infantile stage as a microbe, all the way to a prim-and-proper gentleman of a monster.			"

But if you put thought into the thing you make and find ammusment in watching your designed creature going from singular cell to a galactic empire then you'll certanily find fun in this game. The only downside is that the 3rd and 4th stages of 5 are a bit repetative, and the game is rather short, unless you count the infinite space stage, which can last hours.Then again, some people might just enjoy making giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and having them fly around in butt rockets created in a city filled with buildings shaped like cheese...

												First off, this is a amazing game with high detail graphics full of replay content. I have played this game so much and i still enjoy it which is the best part. From microbes to creatures to tribes to cities to space and beyond, this game has it all! I would recommend this game 10/10!			"

												I first started playng this game when I was ten or eleven and I still love it. This is one of the games I grew on. Yes, it does not have a wonderfull graphics or breathtaking action (actually it does) but this is a really good game. Kids can spend hours playing it, adulst will enjoy it's madness or simply make a♥♥♥♥♥♥like creature.I highly recommend it to young gamers.The creature redactor is wonderfull. Make anything your heart desires and it will still look and move fine.The sounds, the music are great. Feel the atmosphere of new-born life and the beauty of space.Enjoy silly jokes while trading alien races :)Meet an Unidentified Walking Objects made by other users while playing. Some things they build are hilarious.You will have an ability to take over the whole galaxy. Is'n it awesome to be an overlord?It is easier to play as a peacefull creature. Be good.Disadvantages are:Sometimes the game does not work. :DIt is hard to beat it only for the first time. Try to find out everything by yourself so the game would be more interesting.Space stage is completely boring without Galactic Adventures. With GA it is just a little less boring.Too easy to understand how the game works. The interaction with animals/tribes/civilisations is too predictable.			"

												This game is basically five very small games in completely different genres strung together by a single graphic style and very loose narrative.Each individual game has very little content or variety and quickly becomes a race to reach the next game and escape from a lack of new things to see or do. This also means that replay value is very limited as the game will proceed in more or less the exact same way every time.The design of creatures, buildings, vehicles etc has very little effect on their functionality, which is mostly pre-determined by arbritrary rules that are never explained. For instance, an aeroplane cannot have weapons that point down, ie; bombers. You can install such weapons but they will not work.Despite references to evolution, the game's progression feels very contrived and gimmicky and the way in which a species progresses feels more like creationism given how the environment has no effect at all, and is the same each time. The only driving forces in the 'evolution' of species here are the player's sense of aesthetics and the game occasionally telling you to add a certain part in order to progress.With no such thing as difficulty or challenge, the game is unlikely to prove engaging except for small children and people who want games to be challenge free.In short, a grand experiment, but a failed one. It is easy to see and admire the ambitions the game developers had, but the actual product is nowhere near being it. There simply is not enough game in this game to justify the price or indeed even live up to what the store page might reasonably lead you to expect.			"

												I bought this game when it was released in 2006. While Will Wright's original vision of the game was curtailed by EA's desire to rush it out, Spore has a certain charm that I love. When it came to Steam, I decided I needed to buy it again. This and the expansions are really games for people who love to create and create you can! Ships, creatures, builidings, vehicles, planets, missions, and a whole gaxaly's worth of shher fun awaits. It's not a ""serious"" space sim. You have to go into Spore with a sense of humor. It pays a loving if rather quirky tribute to Star Trek and Star Wars and other franchises - there is a HEAVY Hitchhikers CGuide to the Galaxy vibe in Spore. Now, all of that said, the base game is good, but it really shines with the Creature Cereator and goes into warp speed with GalacticAdventures. The latter expansion features on planet missions. There are both Maxis created and user created missions and they range from cute to quite frantic, violent, fast paced affairs.I realize that Spore received mixed reviews. But bear in mind that these reviews were partly informed by the fact that Will Wright was not given time to complete his vision for this game. This game is a guilty pleasure for me amid all the ""serious"" games I play.  Spore is more of a huge creative playground and it does it better than Minecraft at least for me.			"

												Wow I finally decided to get Spore and it's just as expected. Gorgeous game. The level of details is just stunning. So many choices and lovely features. If you guys decide to buy it, I STRONGLY recommend to play in Hard mode so as to extend game time. Because even on hard mode, i'm nearly done with the main game objectives, playing once or twice a week. 17hours total which isn't much but this game is a jewel nonetheless. I'm glad that i bought the game to support the devs instead of torrenting. I created a steam account just to get this lol but now i realise how nice this place is! (: Have fun guys!			"

The idea is great and the gameplay is solid, most of the time.But it does have some lacking attributes.The gameplay its self is like a bunch of mini games put together over the period of a worlds time from the very beginning of life, to the very pinnacle of it.Only dlc you should probably get is the galactic adventures one.

												I do rather love this game, but I won't recommend it.I remember back when it was still in development and little by little sneak peeks were shown and it looked amazingly awesome... and then when it came out it (like so many other games) had been significantly dumbed down for a less complex more mainstream gameplay. Even so there was (and still is) a huge amount of delight to be had in raising your creatures from single celled organisms, chosing their skills by rewriting their DNA from generation to generation until they become civilized and then developing them into the endgame (space exploration) via technological advances.So why no recommendation?Well for a start the game is just outright unstable. The general instability just doesn't seem to be fixable. Everywhere I looked I found it was just an accepted side effect of running the game. So it will crash. And it doesn't autosave. So you must save often. And if you screw up and save after it's begun breaking it will destroy that save game and make it forever unloadable. It's also been ditched by EA so it won't be being fixed.The actual evolutionary stages (barring the last) are just too plain short. I wanted to spend hours on each stage but you zoom forwards, even if you go the completionist route and stick around until you've done every last thing you can. The combat is not great, the social minigame is read a cue and then press one of four buttons (creature stage) three buttons (tribal stage) oh we got rid of the buttons just click on it already (civ stage)The final space stage is huge and is where you will will either spend most of your time, or where you will get quickly fed up and return to the start to create more creatures. There is literally an entire galaxy to take over including a race of extremely unfriendly borg *cough* sorry, I mean Grox towards to the centre. Your creature, that you poured so much time and attention into is replaced by a spaceship and it all gets a bit meh.... Galactic Adventures does try to address this but not well... (I'll deal with that on it's own though).Initially you will ooooh over the creature creator. Eventually you will be frustrated by it's limitations and the relatively restrictive set of main parts. The inability to set a gender/voice for your creature is most evidenced when you create something female looking and it talks like a brawny guy or something cute and sounds like it's just waiting to eat you for breakfast. There are a huge number of really minor fixes that could have been added to this that would have provided some huge quality of life improvements for this game... but despite them being suggested over and over again when the game's developers were still active, they were unfortunately never addressed.I still love Spore. It holds a very special place in my heart, but I can't recommend it. If you still fancy it despite its issues then you'll probably have a great time with it. I'd love to see a sequel - some of the things that were cutting edge when this came out are much more developed now and it could be awesome... unlikely, but still...			"

												The game is a great game, at first... My first 9 hours into the game got me hooked, but once i started space exploration, the game got EXTREMELY boring and repetitive. Sure the galaxy is HUGE and there's soooo much to explore, but after a few hours in space, the same thing happens over and over no matter where you go. The replay value just simply isn't there. I personally bought the game for 12.49 and I will honestly say it's the worst purchase i've made on steam in terms of $$ and hours logged. Edit: If I had just bought the spore game itself without the expansions/dlc (which would amount to $5 on sale), then i could say the game was worth it. So my recommendation to you guys would be to just buy the $5 spore game and not the entire package.			"

												Not bad! It's really entertaining, and I espessially like the custom additions. It had few glitches, and the glitches that I /did/ find didn't effect the game immensely. However, It has crashed once since I started playing it. Unfortunately, this made me lose the game I was on. Luckilly, I wasn't to far into it, and I'm thankful I hadn't gotten any further. I'd recommend this game to people into ""The Sims"" frachise, as well as creative people like myself that would enjoy the customization part of the game.			"

												I find this to be a rather fun and interesting game. If you're not patient enough to sit and try to find all the different parts, you can go from single celled organism to space age in less than 3 hours. But once you hit that final stage there is so much to do. It has blown my mind, between the species evolution,  to the different societal  choices. It's fun, and it's goofy, and the way you play can vary from person to person.			"

												It's fairly upsetting that the game has a limited number of save files to make a standard galaxy for your sessions. With this setup, the only good thing I can see is that you can destroy an empire more than once for self-satisfaction. The endgame is also lacking in that you cannot explore your terraformed and sculpted wonderplanets, so you have to buy this when the game and Galactic Adventures are at least half price. ""Create"" mode is like a dumbed-down 3D modelling system.This game consist of various other games that are shortened and lacking as much content placed side-by-side, with your stamp all over the 2008 cartoon graphics. So how can I possibly recommend this game?Because this game is satsifying, and it will be satisfying each time you play.Do yourself a favor and don't go on a wiki until you have played one empire until you are content. Then, go find out all the different paths that you missed, and strive to take them in your next game. You can be a malicious herbivore. You can bedemonic in the creature stage and friendy in the tribal stage. You can beg for peace throughout billions of years and make a corrput spice empire. The gameplay is a vessel for the stories you create in your mind, much like Dungeons and Dragons, and if you find it too easy then raise the difficulty. Ignoring what this could have been and seeing what's here is the key to his game. If you enjoy putting time, love, and effort into game creations, are able to set your own goals, and don't want to worship MMO item stats, then you should enjoy this game.			"

The space stage probably is the best part about it, but the all the other stages leading up to it aren't bad either.Overall a very good game and not just for Sims fans.			"

												For creative players, even casual players, this is a good choice of game.  One of the most cohesive I've played, at least.  However, since it could have been much more epic than it ended up being, I'd say wait until it's on sale for at least half off to buy it, it's not worth the full list price, in my humble opinion.  Fairly user friendly game, pretty much anyone could play it and grasp the concept easily without needing much outside guidance.			"

												Well, it's a bit hard to describe this game...I'll use a story.A small cell named ""Invictus"" is founded on the planet ""Magna Victoria."" It eats almost everything it can.Invictus goes on to evolve into a beast and causes a mass genocide of other species on the planet.Invictus makes tribes and then finishes its mass genocide.Now for the interesting part.So, with the Invictus species being the only species left, they are massively split between the usual economic, religious, and militaristic. There are only two militaristic states. Purple (me) and Yellow. The purple state and yellow state are constantly at war until finally the purple state takes over the yellow state. Once these wars are over, on the planet's mainland the other states have been conquered by the massively religious Blues. The blue state then immediately declares war on the purples. The purples then rush to conquer the center island to gain aircraft. They gain aircraft and then start to take the mainland. This basically turns into Alexander the Great's conquest of Persia. Basically, a slaughter for the blues. I make every theocratic city bow down to the great purple power. HAIL!Long story short, as space is basically the other half the game, I conquer everything by slaughtering everyone and there's only one species left, which is Invictus. And we lived happily ever after. The end.			"

												Spore gets a lot of flak for not living up to the expectations piled upon it. It was hailed as the ultimate creation game, building your spieces from the ground up, with many customisation options. And admittedly, it failed at that. But I still enjoy this game for what it is.The gameplay is split into 5 sections, or 'stages'. The Cell Stage, Creature Stage, Tribal, City and Space Stages. Cell, Tribal and City Stages are too short, but fun. The Creature Stage is longer generally, and is where you develop your species. But the Space Stage takes up around 80% or more of the game. Unfortunately, it's really not that interesting. You go around space, finding planets, talking to aliens, killing aliens, and making alliances with aliens. Sounds fun? Not really. It's alright, but extremely repetitive. And as mentioned, it takes up most of the game, with a huge grind to get to the centre of the galaxy. I've never personally finished the game and have no idea how it ends. It's just too grindy. However, it can still be fun for a while.Where the main enjoyment of the game comes from is the creation. It has creators for creatures, vehicles (boats, ground, flying and space), and buildings. While not the most extensive, I have still put many hours into simply making things.Overall, I would give this game a neutral rating if I could, but I enjoy it more than I dislike it, so I'm giving it a positive rating.

 Spore  I don't know why i love this game so much. Keep in mind that it has a lot of nostalgic value to me, so i might give way too many positive points. Positive:The Cell Stage: It has a great feeling to it! Like in games like Fishing frenzy, you eat and become bigger, until you can eat things that originally were bigger than you. The stage itself doesnt have a lot of depth. You basically eat or be eaten. And i'm fine with that.Also, i really like the thought of  millions of years passing while you create your creature and live. I find that appealing. It does also apply to other stages, like:The Creature Stage: For me, this is definetely the most fun. And the most defining stage. Here you can choose to be: Herbivore, carnivore or Omnivore(both)! Your choice will affect your playstyle and later game.Herbivore: Pretty easy! All you need is to go to nearby trees and bushes to collect food and that's it! But another factor in it is: Befriending others. Since your attack damage is not that high, you can't really kill. And killing wouldnt even benefit you. So, to make friends you need to have higher stats in social than the creature and mimic their moves.Carnivore: The hardest of all 3. You need to hunt others, because you need meat, and only OTHERS HAVE MEAT. This is really straightforward, since you don't have good social skills, better just kill.Omnivore: THE easiest. This is the definition of ""doing what you feel like"", you have both social skills AND murderous adaptation! Just do what you feel like, but keep looking at the progress bar to stay in the middle.Thoughts: I LOVE this stage! It really makes you feel like you're inside of it! The creatures, meteor showers and even MOTHA♥♥♥♥IN SPACESHIPS. + i don't know why but i really like seeing Epics [huge creatures with a 1000 hp and kills you in one hit. Fun]The Tribal Stage: So, you finished moddeling your creature. As deranged as it looks, it'll stay that way forever. BUT NOW THERE ARE OUTFITS. That's right! You can put outfits which make your attributes greater, for example: a hat, that has 2 COMBAT and 1 GATHERING.In this stage, depending which play style you chose, you play as:The social bloke: The guy who befriends everyone. Yes, your tribe is known to be the FRIENDLIEST on the planet! You bring gifts to meanies and you mimic people with instruments that you build huts to in your tribe place thingy! FRIENDS!The murderous bloke: Everyone is scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of you. You're known to be the most irrational, murderous tribe on the planet! You build huts for weapons, and you destroy other tribe's huts and kill EVERYONE!The whatever bloke: So, you chose omnivore. You're known to be the most irrational on the planet. Sometimes you befriend others playfully with didgeridoos and other times YOU RIP THEIR SPINES OUT WITH AXES AND LIGHT THEIR HOUSES AND CHILDREN ON FIRE WITH TORCHES.Still trying to keep in the middle, i guess.Thoughts: I really like this stage! I find it fun, trying to collect food, tame wild animals and fish!Also, alot easier to kill Epics in this stage. Still pretty hard tho.The Civilization Stage: So, depending on what you chose, it all came to this, which is:If you chose Social (herbivore) you are: A religion civilization!That's right! Your one and only weapon against others is religion! Since you need to capture all cities or you won't advance to the last stage, you need to create your own custom buildings, vehicles! Fun!If you chose Aggresive (carnivore} you are: A militaristic civilization!Yep! Your one and only weapons are...well...weapons! I feel like this is the easiest to play. You pack firepower, and punches. You also need to create custom buildings and vehicles.If you chose the middle one (omnivore) you are: A trade civilization!Yeah! You don't push religion or bullets down people's throats. You collect money, and you just buy other cities! Strangely enough, being omnivore is the hardest in this stage.Thoughts: I also like this one! I love the thought of designing your own vehicles, boats and planes and buildings! I love the thought of being able to follow your own theme or just be incredibly random! Also, this stage is the defining chapter of WHO you are as a civilization. Are you a friendly religion-based society? A murderous bloodthirsty-based society? Or are you rational bussinessmen?The Space Stage: This is it! You're at the top of...well, anything! You're free to do what you want, because after this it won't matter, althought how you played earlier affects how you'll play ti'll the end!Friendly: You get friendly rays and stuffNot friendly: You get lasers and stuffMiddle: You get some advantages in money and buying (i think)Thoughts: I LOVE this stage! Your one and only objective is to: spread your empire! There's almost no choice here tho. You WILL have allies even if you're ♥♥♥♥ing insane. And you'll have enemies if you're even the friendliest person in the ♥♥♥♥ing galaxy! You can go abduct animals! Abduct plants! Colonize planets! Change planet temperature to uninhabitable from habitable, or the other way around! This stage defines your mark on the galaxy!Negative:No multiplayerI absolutely ADORE this game! And if you're wondering whether you should buy this, please just listen to me: YES! YES YOU SHOULD. This is honestly an INCREDIBLY unique experience and i absolutely love it!10/10 "

Unfortunately the game was hyped to hell and thigns got cut and people got butt hurt...so yeah.The creature creator is hell of a lot of fun. I spent hours just fiddiling with creatures in the game when i owned the original disc. And really, I enjoyed myself throughout the entire game. Though some of the stages were way to short, tribal, & Civ in particular. And the space stage has two irritating as hell issues:Pirates and eco disasters.Think of it like this:You have been hopping from system to system, jumped into a few black holes and traveled for like, 20 minutes. Then you get the message....the message you've been dreading. Your planet has an eco disaster and you need to high tail it all the way back to the system before your planet gets screwed. And of course, if your one ship doesn't do it. everything will fall to pieces.So yeah...cheat your♥♥♥♥♥off in that stage, or download a few mods and everything will be peachy.			"

Either way, this game does have its flaws.In the Cell stage, there are certain green creatures that expand, sometimes they can stretch and sometimes even disappear.Even though this game is a title I recommend to anybody, the Tribal and City stages are quite repetetive, it feels more like Clash of Clans, rather than the Beat 'em up free-roaming style of the creature stage and the Cell stages.

												Spore could have been one of the best games in years. The concept is great, designing each stage with it's own features and gameplay style was an awesome idea, and it's incredibly unique and creative. However, the ""final"" game just feels unfinished. EA either bit off more than they could chew with the game or just intended to hype it up and then abandon it mid-development as a cash grab. (Since it's EA, I kind of expect the latter). However, it's still a pretty good game if you want something light and easy to play with little siblings (like I did) that allows for a lot of creativity. However, don't expect it to be a great game you keep coming back to once you've finished a single playthrough.			"

Your goals get bigger and harder and most of your actions affect the species as a whole like if you start off as a carnivore and you eat a lot of cells you become a carnivore etc and pretty much watching your own species conquer the universe in ways that you guided them into if it's being friendly, killing everyone or using wealth...

												IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS RUNNING SPORE:Go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spore"" and find the file called ""runme.exe"". Right click it and set the compatibility mode to Windows XP SP2.Now go to ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Spore\SporeBin"" and find ""SporeApp.exe"" - do the same, set the compatibility mode to WinXP SP2.This should now work. I didn't have to do anything on my Windows 10 x64 machine, but I had to do this for my gf's Win8 machine because nothing else would work.Hope this helps!Otherwise - the game is very fun :)			"

												I LOVE SPORE! this game is like none other I have ever played before! when you makeyour creature in spore, you get this caring feeling to help your creature in situations and help your creature involve as well. you want to watch it get more powerful as your being goes through multiple stages of 'being the better being'. it is also fun to see where your creature ranks in the stages, like whether your lifeform is agressive or not. one complant i do have is the space stage: that feeling of helping your creature envolve 'dissapears' in this stage! in the space stage you will often do missions for other races to get more loot, instead of getting sed loot for something that helps your race in more of a way than getting some loot! plus, even claming places or destroying enemy colonies are harder in this stage than any other, in so many ways! the rest of the game is wonderful and I do recomend it very much!

												Spore is a game where you create your own creature and survive the harsh lands.There are four different civilizations ( Cell mode, Creature mode, City mode and then you go to Space mode) it's really fun and it gets you using your imagination when making things, even though its a cash taker (i got it for $40.00) its still worth it.

												This game is highly reccomended for anyone who wants to make a creature and have a battle in their mind over looks and functionality!I truely love this game! You get to create your own creature and evolve it while socialising and defeating other creatures!I love how depending on what actions do take in every stage, it willchange your abilities, ect. later on!There is replay value! - experimenting with your creature's actions, unlcking new things to use in the main game! (play and gain)I love looking at the timeline and seeing how much your creature has changed since the cell stage!The space stage is AMAZING! Its so ""deep"" and detailed! Fantastic! Wow! It is the PINNACLE of spore!!The only thing i dont like is... the cell stage is too short for me! It is still is great- its and amazing introduction to the game, though, i would lovefor it to be longer!I would rate this game 8/10 for its sheer creativity!PS. This game DEFINITELY deserves a trailer. I didn't know it was this good till I bought it! PSS. I think it would be cool to have local/online co-op/multiplayer either mutliple players play as once spiecies or independant species!			"

												In Spore you start off as a tiny cellular organism, and through adaptation and ingenuity make your way through 5 stages of the game, Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space. The game features a fantastic creature editing kit, which allows you to make anything you want, be it a 6 headed horse, or a reptilian butterfly who practices shamanism. And with the addition of the Galactic Adventures DLC, you can create and share handcrafted quests and missions with other players! It's awesome, Spore ate up my early years of PC gaming, and I can only hope this review will convince you to buy it!			"

												Spore introduces an amazing idea to replicate how life starts off as a single cell, and then evolves to dominate the universe and beyond. The millions (maybe billions) of choices to make in the game, such as creating your creature, making a village hostile or peaceful, or dominating your home planet through military means, is truly amazing. The evolution stages in the game each have their unique touch to it, making the player hooked on to the game for countless hours. Whether its taking down an Epic creature, or making peace with other nations, the game is remarkably fun.10/10			"

Spore is not limited by the ever-present boundaries of physics or common sense, and even in the later game where you can no longer evolve your creature physically, visiting other planets to find that 8-nosed monstrosity you made as a joke living in harmony with 'normal' creatures is great fun.

I personally have a blast with this game and can find myself playing it for hours on end without realizing that all the time has gone by. Great game if you like to create and like to decide your role in the world (because you not only get to create your creature, you also get to choose how it lives, is it a creature that eats everything? does it kill everyone on sight? or is it a peaceful plant eater out to make friends?).I recomend you look at a lot of youtube videos and decide if it will be a good fit for you.

												Before reading please note that this is the first review that i made on steam and that my main language is portuguese so u can expect some grammar errors.~ ***SPOILERS COMING: if u dont want to receive a bucket full of spoilers skip to FINAL DECISON. Spore is a game that represents nature, the evolution of creatures over centuries, basicly it represents how life is created and evolves. In this game u start as a small cell that needs to eat to grow and evolve, u soon realize u need to evolve to hunt and survive other creatures. When u finnaly become the most evolved and the king of the sea u realize that the sea isnt big enough for u now, so u decide that it is time to explore the rest of the world and go to the surface. After your creature has evolved and grown legs u walk into land and your sister and brothers follow u. In order to survive u have to hunt (in case u are carnivorous or omnivore) or go and search for fruit (in case u are a herbivore or omnivore). Many other creatures have also evolved and in order for u to become more intelligent u need to hunt or ally with the other species. Find piles of bones or extiguish a race to get some more pieces that u can use to modify your creaute. The Tribal Stage, in this stage your creature discovers new tools and fire, u are now a intelligent race. As time goes on other tribes will appear, u can choose to destroy them, making use of axes and spears, or to ally with them using musical instruments to impress them. The Civilization Stage, in this stage your creature decides that its time for them to build a great city and then unify your planet using many new technologies (in this stage u can build many stuff, buildings vehicles, etc) u can choose to conquer your rival countrys, use religion to make them join u or make use of economy and buy their lands. The Space Stage, in this stage you are a cadet that is the first of your species to leave the planet and explore other solar systems, many new empires with many religions, tons of other planets with many new species of plant and animals, terraform planets with no life to a paradise with many citys, explore the galaxy and find out what exists in the middle of it.  *******FINAL DECISION*******                                 I played for 49 hours until now and i plan on making the number increase.                                The only real problem that i find in this game is that after u spend some time in the space stage u become very bored.                                U can still search for many new creatures, buildings and vehicles online.                                Make many designs of vehicles and buildings using many decorations and bases.                                Evolve your creature in order to survive.                                This game is based in science about our universe.                                U can also find our solar system in the game :D                                U can change the look of many planets by colouring them or changing their surface.                                Meet many diferent empires (some can be online created races) making missions.                                In my opnion this game is: 8/10.			"

												I'm not a huge fan of EA games in general. Most of them are quickly made, shotty performance, and more often than not crash for no apparent or fixable reason. However, I do have a soft spot for Spore. Its interesting in the least, though does get quite repetitive. If you're trying to make a specific looking animal, good lucky. The builds are difficult to get just right, and trying to be an ally to several species can be even more difficult. You need to interact with just about every possible sepecies in order to get all the parts for your creatures (especially with the cute and creepy pack). But, that's where half the fun comes in. I never made it very far into the game, because I'd keep restarting to fine tune my one creature. If you're a creative mind, you'll probably end up in the same boat as me.			"

												Ive played this before it hit steam. I bought it on steam for ""old times sake"" and to let my kids play it.Even now, 8 years later, its VERY replayable and every game is different in many ways. The endgame in space is what No Mans Sky wish it was.Right now its on sale at €3,74. If you havnt tried it yet you HAVE to get it at this price.But please, no more creatures and cars looking like ♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the workshop...10/10 Will drive♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again...			"

												98/100This is definatly one of my favorite game, the only problem I have with it is that the final stage (space stage) gets a little boring if you don't have the expantion (i'm talking about galactic adventures)If you like 'make your own' style games, this one is for you!You can make everything from animals to spaceships to bacteria to cars to houses!The gameplay is really good and varied too,You can go from swimming around in a lake, scavanging for food to shooting lasers at alien overlords!So in conclution, This is one of my favorite games and I really recomend it to someone looking for a very unique and fun experience!P.S. Don't use cheats, they make the game not fun anymore.P.P.S. BUY IT!			"

												I have very mixed feelings about Spore even after many years and dozens of hours of gameplay. I owned it on origin when it first came out, and while I enjoyed my time playing it I always felt like it was half finished. Each era has a unique gameplay style which is refreshing and a big part of the appeal, but only the Creature Stage really feels fleshed out at all. All the levels are seriously unbalanced, as well, giving specific traits an incredible advantage or disadvantage.I repurchased the game on Steam when a sale made it cheaper to buy all three (Spore, Creepy & Cute, and Galactic Adventures) than to buy just Adventures for my original copy. It adds a lot to the final stage of the game, which gets repetitive fast, except... it, too, gets repetitive fast. I'm not sure if I just don't have the setting right or whatever, but I'm limited to the same basica missions over and over and over. Perhaps if I could figure out how to connect to community made missions it would be more enjoyable. However, community made objects and creatures in game tend to be a mixed bag, so who knows.HOWEVER, I did introduce my 10yr old nephew to this and he is totally hooked. So, if you're looking for a children's game rather than for an adult, then I would recommend it without reservation. It is the shell of a genius game that was simply never fleshed out - trying to do too much too early in the development of the technology. I would love to see a remake with a focus on story and balanced gameplay rather than just the creature creator.			"

												I remember first playing it back at 2010 when I first heard it was nominated for Game of the Year. The concept of being able to create entire new creatures and species was new to me at the time. And to this day, Spore remains in my opinion one of the best games of its genre, despite its age. It's pretty much the No Man's Sky of its era, but a legit, fun game.TL;DR Version: Better No Man's SkyPros:- Hundreds of hours of gameplay- Unlimited possibilities of creatures to create- Game is divided into 5 distinct stages; each with their own way to play (Space stage being late-game, where you will invest the most time if played correctly)- Still a great game after nearly a decadeCons:- The game is old; in my experience the game is capped at 30 fps with mediocre graphics- Once you reach the space stage, it will get repetitive quickly- Creature creator controls is a bit buggy at times- Needs an Origin account to access online content such as the SporepediaLong version:You know those games where once you start to play, you can't seem to quit? Spore is one of these games, and I have enjoyed every hour that I've spent playing. Gameplay:Due to the freedom of choice that you have, you can try out different ways to play; whether you want to be a warmongering dictator, a money-crazed economist, or a friendly peacemaker, the choice is yours I've had multiple saves, each with a different archetype, and I can assure you that the effort spend is worth it.While on the topic of archetypes, there are 9 total archetypes. Each has their own unique skills and advantages in the space stage. Archetypes are determined by your behaviour in previous stages. For example, if you are aggresive throughout the game, you will get the Warrior archetype which increases you spaceship's health and weapon effectiveness. Note that archetypes are determined after the civilization stage and as you enter the space stage. This means that you can make up a combination of 4 different alignments to determine your archetype. It's hard to explain so just Google it. TL;DR: There are multiple classes which have different skills and advantages.The game is divided into 5 stages: Cell, Creature, Tribal, Civilization and Space. The Cell stage acts as a tutorial and foundation to your game. Here, you will decide how you will playstyle in the Creature stage; be it an aggresive carnivore,a sociable herbivore, or be the best of both worlds and become an omnivore.The Creature stage is where the fun starts. You play as a creature you design and try to evolve to a higher sentience. While doing so, you hunt or befriend other creatures to gain body parts which you could use to alter your appearance and abilities. Here, you finalize your looks and enter the Civilization stage.If the Cell stage is a baby, and the Creature stage is a child, then the Civilization stage is the pre-adolescent. The game suddently changes to a RTS and therefore management becomes essential to the game. You control your units and try to achieve global domination by claiming other cities through various means. Here, it gets harder as you pave your way to the Space stage.As I said before, the Space stage is where you will invest the most time in. You explore the universe, meet new species, gain new allies or enemies, and eventually conquer the galaxy. Here, the game's plot starts to develop (although personally it doesn't really matter). This stage requires the most time and focus as the fights get more intense and quests get more complicated and time-consuming. You'll learn more of the business aspects of the game as you trade your resources for money, realizing that some colonies offer more for the same resource. So get money, get better equipment, and start aiming for space domination.Creation:When it first game out, Spore boasts the abillity to be able to create creature that you like. That is true to a certain extent, but it doesn't stop there. When you reach the later stages, you get to design buildings and vehicles. The creation tool is simple and user-friendly and looks crappy at first. But with enough creativity and skill, you can create a lot of unique creations that looks and functions differently. There's also the Sporepedia, where you get to share yor creations and download others'. Unfortunately, the system is unappealing and frankly, bad. It is horribly crowded and the filters don't really help. It would be better if Steam enabled the Workshop here, although it is unlikely since Spore is owned by EA, and the game pretty much runs through Origin.DLC:For both DLC, the C&C and Galactic Adventures DLC, please refer to their individual reviews on my account.- Creepy and Cute- Galactic AdventuresTL;DR: Both provide decent content but is ridiculously overpriced.Overall:Spore is a great game if you love to create monsters and let your creativity run wild. It is also a great RTS with a lot of content to explore. The space stage, however, may get repetitive. I usually find myself playing the space stage for a few hours before going to the creature creator to freshen up my mind. Despite its age, Spore is a wonderful classing and remains enjoyable even today.Rating: 8/10 "

												It's fairly upsetting that the game has a limited number of save files to make a standard galaxy for your sessions. With this setup, the only good thing I can see is that you can destroy an empire more than once for self-satisfaction. The endgame is also lacking in that you cannot explore your terraformed and sculpted wonderplanets, so you have to buy this when the game and Galactic Adventures are at least half price. ""Create"" mode is like a dumbed-down 3D modelling system.This game consist of various other games that are shortened and lacking as much content placed side-by-side, with your stamp all over the 2008 cartoon graphics. So how can I possibly recommend this game?Because this game is satsifying, and it will be satisfying each time you play.Do yourself a favor and don't go on a wiki until you have played one empire until you are content. Then, go find out all the different paths that you missed, and strive to take them in your next game. You can be a malicious herbivore. You can bedemonic in the creature stage and friendy in the tribal stage. You can beg for peace throughout billions of years and make a corrput spice empire. The gameplay is a vessel for the stories you create in your mind, much like Dungeons and Dragons, and if you find it too easy then raise the difficulty. Ignoring what this could have been and seeing what's here is the key to his game. If you enjoy putting time, love, and effort into game creations, are able to set your own goals, and don't want to worship MMO item stats, then you should enjoy this game.			"

												Spore could have been one of the best games in years. The concept is great, designing each stage with it's own features and gameplay style was an awesome idea, and it's incredibly unique and creative. However, the ""final"" game just feels unfinished. EA either bit off more than they could chew with the game or just intended to hype it up and then abandon it mid-development as a cash grab. (Since it's EA, I kind of expect the latter). However, it's still a pretty good game if you want something light and easy to play with little siblings (like I did) that allows for a lot of creativity. However, don't expect it to be a great game you keep coming back to once you've finished a single playthrough.			"

												spore is spore. Thats all i really need to say about it at this point.Everyone and their cat knows that spore is at this point. created by the guy who created the totally not popular at all, Sims series. Unfortunately the game was hyped to hell and thigns got cut and people got butt hurt...so yeah.The creature creator is hell of a lot of fun. I spent hours just fiddiling with creatures in the game when i owned the original disc. And really, I enjoyed myself throughout the entire game. Though some of the stages were way to short, tribal, & Civ in particular. And the space stage has two irritating as hell issues:Pirates and eco disasters.Think of it like this:You have been hopping from system to system, jumped into a few black holes and traveled for like, 20 minutes. Then you get the message....the message you've been dreading. Your planet has an eco disaster and you need to high tail it all the way back to the system before your planet gets screwed. And of course, if your one ship doesn't do it. everything will fall to pieces.So yeah...cheat your♥♥♥♥♥off in that stage, or download a few mods and everything will be peachy.			"

												I remember seeing the trailer for this game on Nick in 2008 when I was 7 years old. Later that year I recieved it for christmas. I had never been more amazed with anything in my life. In case you weren't aware, in this game you guide a creature from it's humble multicellular stages all the way to being a galactic god of sorts. As a child this was super fun to play and I probably would've failed elementary school if my mother hadn't bought a new computer. Anyways, it's 9 years later and this game still totally rocks my a** off. There's an endless array of things to do and with two moderately interesting expansion packs, you might just find the kid in you playing this instead of tending to your worldly responsibilities. Yes it gets criticized for what it's not but that's not really a fair criticism now is it? Witty, far out, and incredible.  10/10			"

												This game is AMAZING. One of the first PC games I have ever played. The graphics really can't be outdated due to the mostly cel-shading. The gameplay is outstanding, the music is good, replayability is off the charts, and, the character creation is tremondous. I recommend this to anyone who likes creating people, towns, vehicles etc. "

												Stage 1: Fun waste of time, not much to doStage 2: The  best or second best stage in the game, gameplay is alright but the creature creation is really where it shines. Amazing how you can make a squid/cheeta hybrid with 8 legs upside down with limbs the size of twigs and the engine will still find a way for it to walk.Stage 3: I was able to beat it in about 30 minutes, not much challenge but it is pretty fun to take down those animals that gave you such trouble in the last stageStage 4: It's like Civ 5 but worseStage 5: WOOOOOOOOOOOOSHHHHHHH SPACE SHIP WOW I CAN FLY THE UNIVERSE IS MY OUSTER I CAN COLONIZE PLANETS HAHA WOW THIS IS AMAZIN and i'm trading spice for 10 hours...

												Spore is a very great game i personally before i got the game i watched around 10 diffrent series on this game such as TerasHD, DanTDM, Aphmou, Mousie, LittleLizardGaming, Bdoubleoo100 and GenerickB. Teras having 5 different series on spore. I've played for nearly 23 hours at the time of creating this and its still entertaining. On the modded side of things the creepy and cute parts pack is not a necesity but its nice to have some lttle peices to have being a cheap-ish price its fine, the Galactic Adventures mod is a must get, after you've played the space stage for a while its a great addition, luckly for me i was able to buy this game for a low price due to the 75% Christmas Discount. I believe this game is well worth the money sadly the error in spore servers makes you opptionally go through a long series of steps to go online, the game overall is great fun and the creativity is too, the player input in to the game is outstanding. At this time Spore is most likely my favourite game. Good bye and good gaming!			"

												Spore could have been one of the best games in years. The concept is great, designing each stage with it's own features and gameplay style was an awesome idea, and it's incredibly unique and creative. However, the ""final"" game just feels unfinished. EA either bit off more than they could chew with the game or just intended to hype it up and then abandon it mid-development as a cash grab. (Since it's EA, I kind of expect the latter). However, it's still a pretty good game if you want something light and easy to play with little siblings (like I did) that allows for a lot of creativity. However, don't expect it to be a great game you keep coming back to once you've finished a single playthrough.			"

This game is an overall neat game and I would like to see more games like it especially from the company who published it EA.			"

												Let me ask you a question... Would you like to be god?.... I know you would.... everybody would.... and this game is the reason why!!! but that's not enough, let's dissect it piece by piece:1-PRESENTATION AND GRAPHICSFirst of all, this game looks AMAZING on max resolution, even in MY pc's resolution it looks good, and it's like minimum or something, and the animations are very well done, except when you add too many legs to your creature and they get web'd, it's safe to say the animation depends if your creature is designed the way they want it to be.2-SOUNDTRACKThis game's soundtrack is VERY atmospheric, it has a ""wonder"" feel to it, the tracks aren't even that good, they just fit the feeling of spore, it's very hard to describe.3-GAMEPLAYThe game consists on Creation Mode and Story Mode, in creation mode, you create your creation created on the Spore creature creator.......... I'm proud of that sentence..........in story mode you ALSO create your creature, but this time, you go from a cell to a space king, with your own adventure...4-CONCLUSIONThis game is fantastic, only one thing... when you get to space stage... Move on... the game gets boring in space stage, unless you try it out and like it, i personally don't, but i completely recommend you try this game if you're a fan of sandbox games, wth that said, i give SPORE...a 6/10			"

												This is an amazing game! From a single-celled organism to a space colonizer, you control a species (Individual animal in Cell,  Creature, and Space stages) or you are a leader for the species (Tribal and Civilization stages). Either way, you can design your species, liken whether they are an herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore, and their buildings (From the Civilization stage to the Space stage). It can take a while to get through the game. However the game rewards you for speed-running (I didn't, but I still completed the Creature and Tribal stages in less than an hour each) with ACHIEVEMENTS! I honestly won't tell you more, because you need nice surprises throughout the WHOLE GAME! I do recommend this game very much!			"

												Don't take it from the time I've spent playing this on Steam, I've played this game for hundreds of hours since it originally came out. Now, this game got a lot of flak because it didn't meet the standards the trailer left for it. Now, while this is true, I still think it was great for what it is worth. A lot of the games feel like minigames, that is true, but it is still a lot of fun, especially once you reach the Space Stage. Traveling the entire galaxy is something I have always wanted from a game.  As well, I have spent hours simply creating new creatures; it's so fun!I'd say this game is worth your money, despite what you would hear.			"

												The moment you get your hands on this game, you will not want to walk away from it... well, at least not for another couple of play-throughs. As with any sandbox-like game, gameplay will become repetitive, but that doesn't make your first experience with Spore any less memorable. There have been times when I've allowed Spore to sit and collect dust for months, but whenever I get the urge to play it, I'm glad that I have it, and the cycle of excitement begins anew. Spore is a must-have for any casual gamer, and certainly recommended for anyone who has yet to try it.			"

												The creativety is UNIQUE. If you are an actual Spore fan like me, and don't make walking shafts, then this is the review for you.This game is like a arcade. Made up of different minigames that are unique in their own way. You start as a cell and evolve into mor ecomplex forms until the wars start. No knights though ;-; just spears to tanks. Every creature is made different and every game is different. You will find more things as you play more campaigns. Maxis don't update this anymore, should have known from EA, but they did leave some pre made creatures.vehicles and plants. If you want to expand on this get the DLC aswell as they add some pretty interesting features.			"

												It's fun, but there's a catch. Whenever you think you're doing really well, it crashes. You think you're fine the first time. All games auto-save nowadays. Wrong. Not Spore. Spore doesn't believe in the auto-save feature. I'm sure there's a mod for it (haven't actually checked) but the fact that the Devs didn't already put in an auto-save feature actually ruins the game for me. All in all it's super fun and definitly worth buying. I'm just not happy about the auto-save feature, or lack-there-of.			"

												Awesomely fun game.My only criticism is that despite it being open world, it is still very restricted.My favourite stage is the creature stage, but it could really do with more of a realistic evolution, where other creatures evolve as well as you, and a more open area to explore.The map is very limmited.The size of the world in the civilisation stage is too small as well. The stage can be completed in under 5 minutes, it would be far more fun if the world was larger and more of a strategic element was added to it, much like in Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle earth, and other top down, strategy games. That would be awesome!			"

												I usually dislike RTS games but Spore is different in my opinion, I abosolutly LOVE how crazy and goofy you can get with your creations! You start from the cell stage and work your way up to creature, tribal, civil, and space. I found that I much prefer the Creature stage mostly because you can be the animal, stalk your pray (if your a meat eater), tear into their flesh and all that good stuff. I just really enjoy being a savage animal. Once you go into the Tribal stage thats when the RTS part of Spore comes in and some people prefer that but like I said I just enjoy being a savage creature killing anything that isn't my own!9/10			"

												Insanely good game. When I was little, I used to play this game alot. It was amazing to play a game of such creativity that brings such a good spice. It is a multi-genre title. I mean, in one part of the game it turns into a RTS! ( Fourth Stage) By far a great game. It works on the not so much gifted computers so it's easy to run.I give it a 9/10. ps: There is a error for some people, when you die in the creature stage you may crash. However, I have not had any other issues with spore other than that, so continue on!			"

Starting as a feeble ickle cell that originated from a meteorite, you will grow into a galactic spice empire, with doom lasers and planet busters. You get to design your species, vehicles, and buildings. In fact, you can see some of your other creations from previous games whilst playing as well!The only 2 downsides, are that planet busters are really expensive, and that you cannot design your own plants.

												This game catches alot of flak for trying to do too much at once, and failing to flesh it's components out enough. I personally didn't mind that all that much. I treat it like the evolution sandbox that it is. Honestly the most fun I've had playing this game is from cell stage to the beginning of space age. I feel like while space age gameplay is the most complicated and expanded upon, it's also the most boring. I loved making the creatures, and roleplaying evolution. Do yourself a favor. Don't completley reconstruct a creature in a differing shape and with completley different better parts. Think about how it would ACTUALLY evovle, and try to keep yourself within those limits. Make your own story for your race. Why do their buildings have spikes on them? Are they agressive? Do they wear armor on the weak spot on their neck? If you do this I promise you the game will mean much more to you.			"

												Loved this game when I was a kid. Even with the expansions now, it still has its issues - lack of complexity in all the game modes besides creature and space, no female voices for your creatures, tedious gameplay. And yet, there's something charming about raising your little cell from a tiny bacteria all the way to the conqueror of the galaxy. You can try to make your creature follow some sort of realistic evolution, or make phallic creatures and laugh as the engine makes them wobble around. Though honestly, go with the first one - the game leaves a lot to be desired, but you can patch those holes with your own creativity. (seriously stop making dickmonsters please.)			"

The stage can be completed in under 5 minutes, it would be far more fun if the world was larger and more of a strategic element was added to it, much like in Lord of the Rings Battle for Middle earth, and other top down, strategy games.

Now, this game got a lot of flak because it didn't meet the standards the trailer left for it. Now, while this is true, I still think it was great for what it is worth. A lot of the games feel like minigames, that is true, but it is still a lot of fun, especially once you reach the Space Stage. Traveling the entire galaxy is something I have always wanted from a game.  As well, I have spent hours simply creating new creatures; it's so fun!I'd say this game is worth your money, despite what you would hear.			"

Sadly, for an unknown reason, I lost all my previous Spore creations except like 5. I do not know why.So if I were you and you were playing this game, back up your Spore creatures so you don't loose them. My Spore account did not save most of mine for whatever reason.9/10Only one point off cause i perma lost my spores........... rip			"

												Loved this game when I was a kid. Even with the expansions now, it still has its issues - lack of complexity in all the game modes besides creature and space, no female voices for your creatures, tedious gameplay. And yet, there's something charming about raising your little cell from a tiny bacteria all the way to the conqueror of the galaxy. You can try to make your creature follow some sort of realistic evolution, or make phallic creatures and laugh as the engine makes them wobble around. Though honestly, go with the first one - the game leaves a lot to be desired, but you can patch those holes with your own creativity. (seriously stop making dickmonsters please.)			"

												Spore is you should say ""Special"" in many ways. Its brings out the creativity in people's mind and is very vast in the styles you can use for your creature and engines/cars. The one thing that I do not like about the game is that it forces you do follow to story line and dosen't let you really stay in a certain stage very long. You also go throw the stages really fast and I would rather stay in the creature stages more when you get to control your creature. Overall the game is really fun and if you have a creative mind I highly reccommend you give the game a try.			"

												It's fun, but there's a catch. Whenever you think you're doing really well, it crashes. You think you're fine the first time. All games auto-save nowadays. Wrong. Not Spore. Spore doesn't believe in the auto-save feature. I'm sure there's a mod for it (haven't actually checked) but the fact that the Devs didn't already put in an auto-save feature actually ruins the game for me. All in all it's super fun and definitly worth buying. I'm just not happy about the auto-save feature, or lack-there-of.			"

												This game is so addicting, this is my first day playing spore. Start up, start new world, conquer cell stage, evolve, conquer creature stage, evolve, conquer tribal stage (I killed everyone), evolve, get to space stage and say, ""This stage never ends, and it doesn't get back to the creature stage kind of gameplay, I just wasted 6 hours of my life"" never play on that planet again, and just create anthros is space creator. The game was fun while it lasted, I start new planets and get up to creature stage and never evolve again. That's how to live the game to it's fullest. End of review.			"

												This game catches alot of flak for trying to do too much at once, and failing to flesh it's components out enough. I personally didn't mind that all that much. I treat it like the evolution sandbox that it is. Honestly the most fun I've had playing this game is from cell stage to the beginning of space age. I feel like while space age gameplay is the most complicated and expanded upon, it's also the most boring. I loved making the creatures, and roleplaying evolution. Do yourself a favor. Don't completley reconstruct a creature in a differing shape and with completley different better parts. Think about how it would ACTUALLY evovle, and try to keep yourself within those limits. Make your own story for your race. Why do their buildings have spikes on them? Are they agressive? Do they wear armor on the weak spot on their neck? If you do this I promise you the game will mean much more to you.			"

												Spore is a fun little game where you begin as a single celled organism. As you progress you collect DNA from killing other animals or simply eating leftovers and plants. The further you go the more parts you collect and from there you are able to completely customize your own life form. Eventually you move onto land and begin the process of becoming a more advanced form of life. Soon your species begins to spread across the globe as your species acheives dominion over all others. Not long after that your species becomes civilized and builds cities and more advanced tools for war.Then comes the space stage... and from there it sucks.

												When this game went on sale, I was so stoked for it. I really, REALLY wanted to play this one after playing the DS game quite a while back. $12 for the entire bundle that would normally cost $50? What could possibly go wrong?Oh. Oh. So very, very much.I'm just going to clear something up right now: the 8.1 hours of gametime I have logged at the time of this review were all continuous.It started out simple enough --- start off as a cell, eat food, and get bigger. Eventually I got to land, and all was well. I decided to play the friendly route. I played as an herbivore and tried to befriend every species I came across. Didn't ALWAYS work, but 90% of the time.Then came the tribal era. At this point, somewhere I snapped. A screw or two came loose and I went on a murderous rampage, sending my Gryphon people to slaughter every other tribe. At this point I was still semi-sentient and had to consistently check to make sure I wasn't hallucinating, and that what I was playing was actually happening, for real, on my screen.When the civilization era hit I may as well have been in a damn coma. I was mentally dead and before I knew it I'd captured every city through military force, even mercilessly killing the last empire that was supposed to be my ally.Next thing I knew I was in a spaceship, shooting lasers at my own kind because they were ""infected"".Eventually I was able to leave this game's grasp. But not without some serious self-reflection later.I began peaceful, only to deteriorate into a murderous psychopath who slaughtered every other existing race before turning on my own, ultimately becoming the highest form of dictator.10/10 would kill 99% of the planet again.

												Aah , finally being able to play Spore once in... two or more years makes me really happy. But soon , an error showed up : "" Spore doesn't work anymore "" As time passed the error started to show up even more , and now it's there everytime.I have no idea how to fix this , nor finding the cause of it.If anyone knows how to prevent Spore for working , please say something.It's not my computer itself , that's for sure , but I just can't play it anymore.Again , let me know if you found the solution.

												Think CREATIVITY. That is what this game is all about, having you make your own look for your little creatures, giving them long legs or giant bent arms, you will have so much fun playing this game. You can make them Herbivore, Carnivore, or both! design the little monster you have always wanted to make! Depending on where you put the parts on the creatues, you can make them look silly, or just plain evil. As the creature progresses through his life, you unlock new things, Which make the game even more fun! I really do suggest you buy this game, and i relly do hope you enjoy it!			"

												This is an overall great game, even though it kind of loses its touch after you first couple playthroughs.  The space stage is only fun if you use cheat codes, unless you have the galactic adventures dlc. The DLCs  are amazing, and even though it isn't a very long game, It is an EXELLENT boredom killer. i can't tell you how many times i couldn't think of anything to do, and ended up playing this game. unfortunately, you can no longer get online content, which is a major setback. I Totally recommend this game, but try to get it during a sale. I find that this game goes on sale a lot, and so do its dlcs, which also have a base of $20 for some jacked up reason.			"

												This game represents itself, from being a cell with not much to do, to exploring the galaxy with infinite possibliites. The actual ""campaign"" is split into five stages: Cell, where you eat everything to grow; Creature, where you become friends with other species or kill them off; tribal, where you become allies with other tribes (or conquer them); civilization, where you buy buildings for your cities to increase income, then ally yourself or become enimes with other cities; and space, where you roam the galaxy terraforming, colonizing, waging war, establishing relations, and more. It ultimetly combines arcade, adventure, strategy, and sandbox gameplay, topped off with a system of deciding whether you're a carnivore, social, economic, etc. Not to mention, the creativity is amazing. You can create your own cells, creatures, buildings, cars, boats, planes, and even spaceships, with a ton of creativity. Overall, I think you should get this game if you don't have it, and although 20 dollars seems expensive, the game is worth its price.			"

												Bypass all the DRM crap and Spore plays well on a ""modern"" win10 system.Basically use creature creator as God SIM. Bundle with DLC: ""Creepy & Cute"" & ""Galactic Adventures"" for added customability including the aforementioned creature creator to build spaceships, buildings, cars, whatever basically.The Gameplay itself is pretty repetitive after a certain point, but the expacs make it a better game, worth about the  $10 I paid for it.

												I played this game for years and decided to try it again out of pure nostalgia when I saw what a disaster No Man's Sky is. Spore has so much more to it, is full of options and paths ans all the small bits and details that few games can bring together. Ofcourse it has it's flaws, and the way EA treated it made players furious with the game in the beginning, but after years of being on the market it kept it's value. People still play it and those new to it can be assured to find a wonderful experience which is more obvious when looking back from Space Stage rather than at the moment of playing previous stages. Cell Stage is short and minimalis, just like the life and tiny world of a cell is, while Creature stage is much greater in scope and gameplay. Tribe Stage and Civilisation Stage are somewhat similar while feeling unique, but shorter that Creature Stage. And then there's the Space Stage, the longest journey in the game, a stage as big as the Milky Way galaxy in both size and scope.If you re disappointed with No Man's Sky and you wanna get your space-game fix, don't pass up Spore.

First I just installed it without registering, then in the last few years I transfered it to steam But I only recently (2016) discovered I could transfer my spore game to origin (which has spore online mode; to see other people creations(EA)). This game is absolutely fantastic for creative minds. Start from a tiny multicellular sea creature and grow into the dominant space race in the entire SPORE universe. Overall it's a childrens game, but I am a 21 year old man and I will play this game on and off until I'm too poor to afford intern... I mean for years to come.			"

												I've had this game since the year it released, and I can safely say I didn't get bored with it for a very long time. After taking a year-long break, I've come back to the game and it still entertains me. The creation system is good and complex, and playing through the story is fairly entertaining as well. The only thing I can say about this, is get the complete pack, or at least Galactic Adventures because the latter especially makes the game far more entertaining. The only real downside to this game I can think of personally is that the community is not anywhere near as active as it used to be, but they seem to be working on fixing that by bringing back featured creatures and such.Oh wait, I can think of one actual complaint.Maxis, if you're reading this:GIVE US BOT PARTS. Even if its a DLC, because very few people have them but very many people want them. The promotion was cool but nowadays its impossible to get them without modding, which you can not do with the steam copy as far as I know. I am a long time player of this game. I have multiple copies of the disc version and all its DLCs, and I rebought the game on steam recently to show my support. There is an audience and potential for this game to make a comeback if you really put in the effort to try.Thank you for reading my review. Have a nice day.			"

												This game is about 4 years old but still is great. It is an evolution based game you start as a cell then evovle to a land animal. As you go you can create and customsie your animal species as you like with different parts you find. Each part has different attributes that you use to fight other species ect. This is only the second stage.Here are the stages I know of in order...Cell, Animal, Tribal, The next one is a furturistick society and they next stage is you and your colony heading off to space.Thank you I love the game and would reccomend it.

It really makes you feel like a god, making a species from cell to space, everything that happens is because of you. Its endless what will happen and very addictive. 10/10, it preforms good for me.   the only issue is EA, we all know there the devil of gaming, and you need all these account stuff to get anything made by other and not Maxis.

												Spore is a game where you evolve a species from a tiny cell (Microbe) into a space dwelling empire, a great concept, and overall, a great game! I played Spore quite a while back, right when it came out, I played it for hours on end. I decided to come back to it 3 years later, and wow, it's still a really addicting game, (44 hours? That's not much. Well, I've played on the Creepy And Cute expansion for a lot more) they include multiple types of gameplay, as in Cell stage, you work your way up and grow by eating until you are large enough to walk onto the shore. Creature stage is slightly different, as it's a bit more open world with more options and possibilities. You can either socialize or hunt down creatures in a nest. Creature stage also opens up to the Creature creator, with far more parts then Cell stage that will help you adapt and survive to eventually make it to the top, eventually leading you to Tribal Stage. In this Stage, you take control of your tribe members, socializing or killing off other competing tribes. Tribal stage also leads to equipment to put on your creatures. Once you defeat or ally with 6 of the tribes, you head off to Civilization stage with 3 unique ways of gameplay. This stage you take control of cities, by either capturing them with military might, buying them with trade routes, paying them enough for them to eventually ally with you, or forcing your peaceful beliefs on cities. This is where Spice begins to take an important role, when you capture these spice geysers, it gives you income, which allows you to build your cities and create vehicles. Once you get world domination, it leads you to a casual Space sandbox. This game is all around a really amazing game, I have to give it a good 9/10. Totally worth the money.			"

												This is an overall great game, even though it kind of loses its touch after you first couple playthroughs.  The space stage is only fun if you use cheat codes, unless you have the galactic adventures dlc. The DLCs  are amazing, and even though it isn't a very long game, It is an EXELLENT boredom killer. i can't tell you how many times i couldn't think of anything to do, and ended up playing this game. unfortunately, you can no longer get online content, which is a major setback. I Totally recommend this game, but try to get it during a sale. I find that this game goes on sale a lot, and so do its dlcs, which also have a base of $20 for some jacked up reason.			"

												I played this game for years and decided to try it again out of pure nostalgia when I saw what a disaster No Man's Sky is. Spore has so much more to it, is full of options and paths ans all the small bits and details that few games can bring together. Ofcourse it has it's flaws, and the way EA treated it made players furious with the game in the beginning, but after years of being on the market it kept it's value. People still play it and those new to it can be assured to find a wonderful experience which is more obvious when looking back from Space Stage rather than at the moment of playing previous stages. Cell Stage is short and minimalis, just like the life and tiny world of a cell is, while Creature stage is much greater in scope and gameplay. Tribe Stage and Civilisation Stage are somewhat similar while feeling unique, but shorter that Creature Stage. And then there's the Space Stage, the longest journey in the game, a stage as big as the Milky Way galaxy in both size and scope.If you re disappointed with No Man's Sky and you wanna get your space-game fix, don't pass up Spore.

												this game had quite a good build up to it, but it seems to fall short of great game due to it revolving around evolution then making the change between stage seem.....way too simple.

Overall i still enjoyed the game and would recommend it to children interested in biology and/or evolution.			"

												A fun game, if it doesn't quite reach it's potential.Will Wright's Spore started out as a grand experiment in evolution, equal parts game and educational tool. When it saw release, fans of Maxis were dissapointed to find many of the touted features had been stripped out (including an entire stage) and everything given a cartooney makeover, seemingly in an attempt to replicate ""The Sims"" success with the casual market. It seemingly worked as Spore was a very popular game.Despite this, what we have is still an intiresting game. There are five mini-game like stages where the early goals are to survive and evolve while eventually growing your culture.CELL STAGEYou start out as a microbe and must feed either by hunting other microbes or grazing algae. intermittently throughout, you can find a partner and evolve your species. This is done through the ""creature creator"" where you can attach various body parts such as claws, defensive spikes or pretty much anything you want. More and more parts are unlocked as you collect ""evolution points"" throughout the stages. The creature creator is the easily the best part of this game and the amount of customisation is staggering. There is also some strategy as various body parts have different atributes attached to them and can effect the type of build you are going for.CREATURE STAGEOnce your creature is large enough, it grows a pair of legs and climbs out onto land. Gameplay is much the same, keeping your species alive and evolving but now you can interact with other creatures as you try to grow your brain size. The ""creature creator"" options expand enormously. In my opinion this is the best stage of the game.TRIBAL STAGEHaving achieved sentience, your species forms a primitive tribe and must either go to war or ally with other tribes. As you are now a society, your biology is locked and can no longer evolve. Instead of evolving your creatures, you can now deck them out with basic tribal outfits and jewlery.CIVILIZATION STAGENow that your society is more advanced, you have a home city where you can design the various buildings and veicles. Your goal now is to subjugate the various races on your planet by either warring with them or converting them to your religion. This is in my opinion the least intiresting stage, thankfully it is also the shortest.SPACE STAGEHaving conquered your planet, your eyes now turn towards the heavens. You design & build a ship and explore a vast galaxy. You make trade deals and alliances with other races and try not to go to war with the games villains, the Grox. You can visit hundreds of worlds, establish colonies, terraform planets, even abdust creatures from one planet and seed them on another. It really is quite complex but can be overly repetative. There are various optional objectives, reaching the highest rank, conquering every other race, reaching the centre of the galaxy, but there is no real end-state so you can continue indefinately.There is no way all the creatures and plants can fit onto the disc so the other really notable feature is that when connected to Maxis' servers the creatures designed by other players can populate the various worlds.If you haven't noticed, the gameplay in each stage seems to follow a pattern, either befriend or kill all your competition. There really isn't much variation between these stages. There was also a stage cut from the game during development process. Set between cell & creature, the fish stage would act as a bridge from sea to land.While Spore is not the game it could have been, it's still worth the €15 asking price for the creature creator and space stages alone.

												[TLDR: What No Man's Sky wanted to be.]This is the game that, in my opinion, kick-started the whole space craze that's been going on in gaming recently, and hilariously enough, it's still got it even after all these years. As games such as Elite Dangerous and No Man's Sky continue to build upon the space aspect, that seems to be all they focus on: space. This game, with its impressive expansion ""Galactic Adventures,"" has it all, from ground-side missions to space truckin'. And that's just the tip of the iceberg!+Has a certain goofy charm to it akin to the Sims.+Even for today's standards, the game looks pretty great.+Each stage of evolution has its unique gameplay style and is a ton of fun.+Many different paths to choose from; become a destroyer of worlds or a protector of all life.+Customize just about everything, from the creatures theirselves to the cities they live in.+Make alliances and enemies throughout your journey to dominate the galaxy.+Side quests, especially with Galactic Adventures, make the game more varied and interesting.+Planets are varied and are completely manipulatable.There are, however, a few hiccups here and there:-Complexity meter can sometimes be too restrictive.-Some animations on custom creatures can be awkward.-Beginning evolution stages can be very short and shallow.-Allies in space stages can be a bit too needy.-Cartoony-ness may put some people off.Thankfully, however, most of these issues can be ironed out with mods! That's right, mods exist for this game, such as Platinum Spore, Titanspore, and Dark Injection, which adds in the parts from Darkspore, this game's darker and edgier spin-off.I cannot recommend this game more to people who want their space fix, and, while I'm uncertain if the online component of the game even functions anymore, there are plenty of awesome creations for people to go out and download, especially the Galactic Adventures missions!<Final Verdict: Worth the Buy, Worth your Time!> "

												SPORE™, A great game for sure. It can be strange to some but really compelling to others. EA really did well on this one. Its funny how its almost some of your game genres mashed into one. like 3rd person exploring/fighting, rts, and builder game. one of two of my fav mechanics is the custimization. You can really get creative about this because you've got all these parts and can make a creature, a veichle, or a building.  The dlc is ok on this game... Galatic Adventures is great though...Galactic adventures is a cool one as you can really build your own... adventure... its nice.10/10 would get hole tribe smashed by EPIC again.			"

												Spore.The game where you can dive into a world of things to explore. You may find, dark, scary things such as bones the size of a mountain, and creatures the size of so roaming the planet's surface.Lightning strikes down upon us, setting our village to flames. It reminds me of when I first saw that fire. I named it the red flower.An object, completely circle towered above our feeble attempts to retreat. Bright red lights shone down onto my friends I had known since the beginning of my life. I looked away. I watched as everything and everyone I knew died in front of my eyes. It was horrible.I somehow managed to survive that horrid day, I found the survivors and rebuilt our civilisation. We discovered many things that would aid us in our lives. We grew stronger and conquered our enemies.We discovered a large metal cylinder inside one of our opponents buildings that were not nothing but dust. The cylinder opened, and I remembered. I remembered the day that my friends died. It was that flying monster, that horrible, horrible thing that killed us all. But I had to explore it.Night was falling, and we had defeated every living thing that could possibly be a threat. No mercy. Just death. A thick fog blinded us as we made our way back to the spaceship. It towered above us yet again. The rest of my fellow friends stood beside me, and crowded around the ship. I opened the hatch and walked inside. I felt the eyes of many people watch closely as I disappeared into the darkness of the spaceship.A whole new world surrounded me. It was amazing. I flew further out of the planets gravitational pull. Out of the solar system. I gazed over the white pretty lights sparkling and twinkling in front of me.Then I saw it. Another person to defeat.The enemy spaceship wizzed around me as I tried to find a way to fight back. BOOM! A missile hit the ship. The spaceship fell off course, and was aiming straight back to my planet. Those red lights punctured the ship and cut it in half.I flailed helplessly as I was pulled out of the spaceship, still falling back to the planet. I realised that I was about to die. Tears fell down my cheeks as I choked without the oxygen I needed to live. I hoped I would pass out before I hit the surface of our barren planet that was ripped of resources by us.I waited for my death. Closer and closer the planet came. Helplessly falling. Down and down. I remembered everyone I loved and knew, and felt sorry. I should of fought with them against the spaceship. Instead of being a coward and running. I should of fought, and not care if I died. At least I would go down as a hero.Another single tear fell down my left cheek, and I hit the ground.10/10, I really enjoy exploring new planets and species. I love the first stage, it's like agar.io!			"

												Even though this game is old, it shall always stay gold. No other game comes close ot what this game offers, or takes on such a challenge with all the mixed genres inside of it. A very fun and family friendly game, and is very creative. The only thing that could ever come close to this is a sequel. You start as a smal amoeba, and conquer your way to the top of the food chain, grow a brain, adventure land, form tribes, hunt, gather, build empires, destroy them, and even explore space as far as you want.

												Fun game, quite funny. You can create an alien species, starting from a cell in the ocean to going into space travel. Every animal.. er.. creature you make will turn out weird. Never try to make an existing animal in this game, it will turn out to be an abomination. In the creature stage, your.. things many weird noises. You can make friends with other creatures on this planet or you can kill them.There are many solar systems and planets that are all different. You're technically in one giant galaxy (Yes you can find earth), and you can go to the center, but there's an evil empire taking over the core.Fun game, every creation I make, from the animal to the buildings and vehicles, makes me laugh.

 WAIT FOR A SALE!  I've played like 77 hours of this game, I launch it through the dlc Galctic Adventures so all my hours are on that. Not that hours make a review more reliable, but they help show that I do know what's going on with this game. It's kind of a nastalgia game for me too becuase I played it first in the demo when I was a kid, all you could do then is make a creature. I've been playing the game every now and then for around 9 years. I have it on Origin too for some reason Idk I just really like this game. Spore is a weird creation, survival, & strategy game. You can create a creature and just leave it alone, or you can play as it through various time periods. (Cell, tribal, space age, etc). Alternatively you can have creatures you've created encounter you throughout your journey while playing as a diffferent creature. I can't get the online to work anymore, it just consists of sharing content you've made and downloading other's. The cute dlc sucks, just get the space one if any. It's not very good either but it's better than the cute one. The space dlc let's you make your own stories and adventures, which is fun. The game's adventure is super cool until you reach the tribal stage then it's like ""Yea, ok. So this like an optional viewmode, right?""  NOPE!  After the creature stage, the game shifts you into this weird, strategy game with your clan of tribecreatures are fighting (or co-oporating) with other tribes. The game remains like that for the rest of it. Weird strategy that is frankly really boring. I just like making creatures and making my own adventures, even though I can't share them because the online won't work. Yea, it's not the best game, but it's fun for a bit and you should buy it IF it's on sale.  "

												It was extremely difficult to get it working properly. For whatever reason the registration files don't lead to the right directory and I had to edit them, which was terrifying, but i got it working in the end and had a great time playing it.  Bottom line, know what you're doing or know someone who can help you get this working before you buy it.  But if you think you can handle it then definitely get it, it's such a fun game.			"

												Spore has always been a fantastic game for me, my brother, sister, even our friends to create wacky creatures and enjoy the content at which Spore provided, I don't know anyone who dislikes this game! I will admit, once you get to the space stage there's nothing much going on other than the infamous (""Grox"") or whatever.. Here are some of our thoughts on how Spore could have been improved overall as a game:* Bigger planets and better customization of nests, villages, towns, etc.* Weather effects on the planet, if you're in a snowy plains your creature could potentially freeze to death if it hasn't evolved to such a degree making life on your planet a treacherously hazardous one indeed!* A lot more customizability, it's one of the biggest things keeping Spore alive to date and we all agree we wish there was more to the whole customization of it all so we could create our amazing potential top of the food chain ruler of the Galaxy.* More to the whole space stage, you work so hard to get to it and you're not even a quater of the way finished.. the space stage is so long, tedious, and perpetual a lot more customizability and content could really go into improving it. Perhaps something like orbital space cannons that defend the planet you place them around; having alien ships drop off tanks and troops to overall make the invading of another planet more interesting; the mining of planets and stars for steady cash flow to fund your endeavors in this empire of yours and beyond! Having to do all the work to make money while also defending and invading planets over time especially with as many as you encounter and in the distance you encounter them in simply put becomes ludicrous insanly fast.. like come on, defend yourselves for once! The player shouldn't always be required to save a planet from some kind of mythical disaste only they can stop apparently.* The ability to forge numbers in your army to send armies of troops to invade/defend planets for you without you having to even leave the star system you're currently in.* Have freight shipments go to and collect your resources for you automatically based on the number of freight ships you have available.Well those were some of the ideas we discussed.. overall, game's worth a play in my opinion and was a fantastic game for its generation. ;)			"

												I have to say, When Spore first came out, I hated it. The original concept for the game was one of breathtaking scope and potential. After the developers got EA involved, things seemed to take a turn for the worse. By the time the game was actually released - it was not what I, and I suppose many others, had hoped it would be. Spore as it exists today is a vastly simplified version of what it could have been and did not live up to it's potential. A fact so lamentable that after just a few hours on it,  I didn't play it again for 5 years. I have recently decided to give it another chance, and time must be a great healer because I am now able to see past the failed potential, to the see the real game that Spore is. Yes, it makes a complete mockery of evolutionary history when you go from a cell (which somehow has eyes and bones) to a creature with legs, but despite this cartoonish simplification you can still have a lot of fun with spore.The creature creator is excellent; powerful and easy-to-use (when you get familiar with it), it allows you to create almost anything you can imagine. Whether it's you and some friends getting together to make some funny creatures or seriously trying to create a master race - it's going to be fun. The procedural animation generation is brilliant too, and despite our best efforts to 'break' it; my friends and I consistently found our creatures being able to move and walk well enough to play the game with.Spore tries, fairly successfully, to be 5 games in one. Pac-man, WoW, Populous, Command and Conquer and A 4X game such as Galactic Civs. The problem, of course, is that you will have played better versions of each genré that Spore offers.  The transition between these genrés is jarring too. Rather than seamlessly blending gameplay styles as you slowly gain or loose abilities from generation to generation, the game instead lurches you violently and abruptly from one game style to the next. There are other continuity errors, highlighted at the end of each stage when it displays the time-line of your creation. Despite only getting the chance for a few generations in each stage, it confidently informs you that 3 or 4 billion years is somehow supposed to have passed. You can also radically alter your creature every time you breed, which contradicts the concept of fostering a single species through it's evolution.The cell and creature stages are definately the most fun to play - but, unfortunately, you will feel rushed through. Even on 'hard' mode,  the stages are very short unless you purposefully drag them out, and the game seems determined to get you on to the final frontier, the space stage. While this is all well and good - the space stage itself is pretty boring - consisting of performing the same, basic routine missions and activities over and over again in order to expand your empire. At this point, your creation looses all sense of individuality and because of this the space stage seems somewhat lacking and definately not worth the seeming rush to get there.If you have an active imagination, and an interest in seeing what others can come up with, Spore can be very fun indeed. Especially if you can get online (I cannot as I bought the product through steam and EA claim I don't own the game) the space stage can be great as you get to explore other peoples' creations and ecosystems, painted planets etc.It seems though, that my original qualm with spore is the reason why I got bored of it again - the depth and scope of the core concept far outweighs the actual end result, and while I can finally appreciate Spore for what it is, I cannot help but be dissapointed when I think about what it could have been.

												Incredibly addicting. Takes you through the evolution of any creature you wish, making it your own and then thrusting it into the world to interact and thrive based on the traits you gave it. Think of it as a mix between the customization of Sims, the city-building of Sid Meyer's Civ (starting at the base level of a microbe), and the all-powerful freedom of Godus. Got it on the Steam sale, greatest (discounted) purchase I have made yet.			"

												Spore is a god-like game, starting a single-cell organism emerging from a meteor to a sentient, galatic race. But there are reviews against Spore like, The game Spore is not evolutionary correct and that the creatures evolve depending on what the player thinks is ""cool"". But I say that it is just a game, it doesn't have to be correct. If it was put in the education genre then there's a problem. It is a sandbox game not a realistic game, it is to express creativity among players not false images of evolution. That is why if they say, type or write something idiotic about Spore, in fact about any game ignore them and buy it or promote it. It is your choice not the media's.			"

												I going to be very direct and honest here. Simply put, God gave the gifts of imagination and creativity to all Mankind. These happen to be two of my favorite gifts that God gave us. Spore happens to be a game that allows for alot of creativity and imagination on the part of the player!!! That in itself makes the game awesome!!! There are an incredible amount of options for creating your own race of creatures and the creativity does not stop there. You can design all your buildings as well as all your vehicles (land vehicles, boats, flying machines such as helicopters, airplanes, spaceships and any other flying devices you can think of.), you can decide which plants and animals will be placed on which planet for them to inhabit. You can also terraform any planet in pratically everyway!!! You can raise or lower the land, change the atmosphere and even change the color of the sky of each planet!!! Now I could go on forever about the creativity of the game, but I really need to mention that the play control is excellent and more importantly the gameplay is truly excellent!!! I'll finish by saying that Spore is not only my favorite game of all time, but I also believe that Spore is currently THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!! "

												Alright, you know what people? I'm sick of seeing 'this is better than NMS' all over the place. First of all, spore is NOT any less buggy and incomplete. I love spore, but by Spode, if I have to look at how it's soooo much better than No Man's Sky too much more, I might barf. No Man's Sky, from what I saw, is a phenominal shot at something that just needed more work, which could also be said about spore. You know what the difference is? Spore was made by EA, (An actually well known company that freaking knows better) but they never implemented autosave, have ZERO support, can't get their servers to work for♥♥♥♥♥♥ is notoriously horrible for using key codes all over the place in the most obnoxious ways, and has a budget that would make trump mildly impressed. No Man's Sky is an indie game... a very good indie game... that just needed more time before release, and for some reason, it's become a 'meme' for horrible game design and space-genre failure, which I just don't think it deserves. But by all means, keep bashing on it, because if I was the game developer, there is NO reason I can think of to properly finish the game and make something incredible once half the world thinks it's the standard for horrible.

												Great game. Very simplistic and in depth at the same time. I just downloaded this on 09/25/2015 and found out the servers are no more. This is a really sad thing for this game. Even though you didn't play online with other people their creations would randomly spawn in your own world. It was a huge database of millions of creations by other users. That was part of the charm. Now you are limited to what you make yourself and what is pre-loaded (some 2,000 creatures). It's still fun to play. However, I think the entire bundle should be less than $20 because it is lacking the key component now.			"

												Despite being released in 2008, this game still rivals even new releases. I've been a huge fan of Spore since I first played it in 2010, and am still dumbfounded by the level of creativity of some of the community's creations.Some people seem to be having issues with their Steam Key not being verified correctly when signing up for online. I too had this problem. Thankfully I had my old account to fall back on, but I do reccomend that you look into this issue before purchasing the game. The community aspect of this game is what really makes it shine, and the game suffers somewhat without it.This game has serious replayability, and the exploration aspect is mindblowing. You can explore an entire galaxy full of stars, the vast majority of which have orbiting planets, some of which have moons. Alongside this, the space stage has a number of beautiful features such as binary systems, black holes, protoplanetary systems, a stunning galactic core, cube planets, and the elusive storybook planets. There are also many others including easter eggs (finding Earth, for example).Each stage is as good as the previous, and the level of customisation is mindblowing. For this price, everyone should be buying this game... Well, I'd be saying that if online worked for everyone.			"

When you have done so do not press ""Submit"" but press the little arrow instead.Next problem, where I am now is that there is a server error.Bacisly the internet says that if you want to play this game buy if directly fra EA..And oh yeah the do not maintain their gaming homepage .. so this kinda sucks..

												Great game but relies on saving manually.Also you can't sign in to it or make an account and do you know why thats important?cause if you do not have an account it won't save like if you go to a different computer or buy a new one you can't continue and it also is a pain if it crashes making you start over again. overall summery is 7/10 good game, never gets repetitive, saving is a pain though. overall score is: good game i recommend to buy but save often so it won't reset.

												Spore is a really fun game with something for everyone. For example, if you like creating things, you can save up money and buy better accesories to evolve and make your spore epic. Another thing is that if you are more about fighting, you can battle against other spores. I reccomend this game to people ages 11 and up because it does have some other things. Altogether i enjoyed this game			"

												This game is Great. People call it Glitchy or Bad but I don't think that. The game let's you Make your Own Creature and Share with the World. The Game has 2 DLC Packs which just Add's on to the already Fun and Great Gameplay. Sure some people say it could of been better with the Feature's that the Beta Had like Bloody Battle's, Aquatic Stage and More but I think the game is still Great. Sure I Do wish the Beta Build does get Released and Trust me there is people trying to do that with Change.org and Stuff like that but there is Mods for that. Which Bring's me to my Next Point... THE COMMUNITY. The game has a HUGE Community who really Like this Game as Much As I do. Over the Years the Game has Seen Thousands OF Mods like Dark Injection's. Many people had Pirated the game But Some People Didn't. I even Saw a Copy of Spore at Target on Sale Once. I hope people see My Review and Many Others so they can Give this game a Second chance and See the Wonder's of this Great game.			"

												For an 8 year old game, I think Spore has held up very well against the times. Despite its age this game has managed to retain a uniquely fun and engaging charm that and plays out in a way that makes it feel very unique for such a seemingly simple game.One of the thing that helps Spore stand out in my mind would be the way the game shuffles itself around with each stage you progress through. In the Cell Stage, your in a 2D enviroment. Creature Stage your in a third person 3D enviroment. For the Tribal Stage & Civilisation Stage, the game takes on more of an RTS-esque feel, and the Space Stage it becomes a third-person space ship flying like game.Not only that, but the game hasvarious different unique playstyles that can suit practically anyone, and depending on the path the player picks, it can have huge and very interesting effects on their game down the line depending on how you like to play, with things such as traits playing a huge part in the game as your progress.Needless to say, Spore has a seemingly endless amount of content, and there's almost certainly something for everyone. No two game ways can ever be truly the same as far as Im concerned, and this game is undoubtebly a must have for any and everyone. To summarise, things, the games tagline of ""From Single Cell to Galactic God"" is arguably one of the best one-line descriptions a game can get and couldn't be more accurate.			"

												Underrated gem that oozes with charm, and still has some of the most ambitious and interesting procedural generation in a game to date, despite some pretty major flaws in a few spots. Still, especially now that it's gone down in price, it's well worth picking up.

												(6.5/10) [65%]The Universe is HUGE.You build.evolve Your alien race in the first 35% of the game. The only use for all your hard work in the first part, is to have Your aliens and designs look a certain way, and unlocking the next part of the game. The rest of the game is pretty much diplomacy, terraforming and trading.The game does not have enough depth, for a space type sim.  You have to get to the center of the universe,  fighting off ""cyborg gremlins"".The game is worth-while playing, and fun. Sets the stage for cerebral expansion, and future thoughts.			"

												The game itself is pretty straight-forward. Creating your own species is fun, finding parts to change your species (and its stats) feels fun and rewarding in its own way, and watching your species grow from single-celled organisms to walking/thinking/breathing land creatures is awesome.There are a few issues. Namely creature mobility in certain stages, and weird glitches in customization. I bought this for $5 and frankly, I would've easily paid a little more.The problem is there is no online multiplayer anymore, meaning some of the advertised features no longer work. All of the multplayer/online features involved finding player-created creatures/houses/buildings in your game. That's about it. Even with no multiplayer, the game is still fun.The last problem I have with the game is it's pretty short. Completionists can easily clear a majority of the game in under 10 hours. All in all, fun game, would recommend.			"

												What I learned from Spore:1. Killing someone without any weapons is less impressivle when you have a set of arms with saws for hands.2. Even when you have even wider tracts of land, people still like it when you tell them you admire theirs.3. When in doubt, give them fish and all is forgiven.4. Music unites all.My experience with spore:>Had my eye on it for more then 1 month>Mom buys it for 20 dollars but something happens and the file can't run>Slowly forget about it's existance>Years pass>Sees JackSepticEye play it>All the memories flood back>One year passes in which i keep my eye on this game wait for the perfect opprotunity>That opprotunity comes when I see it's on sale for five dollars>Insantly buy it with no regrets.>The game is amazing, just like i knew it would be>Play the sh*t out of it for 2 days straight in which I kill EVERYONE>Start a new game on the third day>Becomes  the next hitler  Donald Trump and buys everything>To be continuedOn the real though, this game is a steal, even at it's normal price of 5 dollars. Did I love it? Hell yes I did. Do I miss the servers? Hell yes I do. BUT, maxis did such an amazing job with creature diversity that I honestly can still play the game with the creatures they made, and the ""Deja vu"" Creatures I made earlier. Would I reccommend it?

												2 words: IT'S AWESOME!!! (If you have all the DLCs, double the fun!)Pros:- MAKE YOUR CREATURE!! (whatever you think that is)- Evolve it! (and die alot)- GET TO SPAAAAAAAAAACE!!!!!!!! (then meet the grox and die)- Delete a planet and watch its explosion, KABOOM! (and then feel bad for killing your species)- YOU CAN LOGIN TO SEE PEOPLE'S CREATIONS! (and then be jealous because you can't make better in any way)- Everything you basically see in the game. (exept the cons)Cons....:- Sometimes the game has login errors (i hope you don't rage that hard)- Maxis is no longer active in this game (so none of these cons will be fixed)- =(insert con here)= (what more can i say?!?)There are more pros than cons....so it's a positive!

												I reccomend this game because its a load of fun! In Spore there is a story mode which is awesome.  Its set out like this. You start as a cell then you grow legs and then your brain becomes bigger and bigger which leads to the next stage. You can get to the Space stage in atleast a day Also Space stage is the last. In space stage you can take over other planets, Destroy Them, Make allies with the current owner, Destroy the current owner and take over or you can even just fly around and steal its plants and creatures :D This is a 9/10 Game because its limited you cant go so far without buying all the DLCS which is a tonne of money.

												Despite being released in 2008, this game still rivals even new releases. I've been a huge fan of Spore since I first played it in 2010, and am still dumbfounded by the level of creativity of some of the community's creations.Some people seem to be having issues with their Steam Key not being verified correctly when signing up for online. I too had this problem. Thankfully I had my old account to fall back on, but I do reccomend that you look into this issue before purchasing the game. The community aspect of this game is what really makes it shine, and the game suffers somewhat without it.This game has serious replayability, and the exploration aspect is mindblowing. You can explore an entire galaxy full of stars, the vast majority of which have orbiting planets, some of which have moons. Alongside this, the space stage has a number of beautiful features such as binary systems, black holes, protoplanetary systems, a stunning galactic core, cube planets, and the elusive storybook planets. There are also many others including easter eggs (finding Earth, for example).Each stage is as good as the previous, and the level of customisation is mindblowing. For this price, everyone should be buying this game... Well, I'd be saying that if online worked for everyone.			"

Luckely that is explained here on Steam.If you allready have an EA account, type in your info as you wanted to make a new account. When you have done so do not press ""Submit"" but press the little arrow instead.Next problem, where I am now is that there is a server error.Bacisly the internet says that if you want to play this game buy if directly fra EA..And oh yeah the do not maintain their gaming homepage .. so this kinda sucks.. I'm considering this to be the last agme from EA I'm buying..----After a reset of my pc - I could log in again ... I will edit this Review if changes again!			"

												What I learned from Spore:1. Killing someone without any weapons is less impressivle when you have a set of arms with saws for hands.2. Even when you have even wider tracts of land, people still like it when you tell them you admire theirs.3. When in doubt, give them fish and all is forgiven.4. Music unites all.My experience with spore:>Had my eye on it for more then 1 month>Mom buys it for 20 dollars but something happens and the file can't run>Slowly forget about it's existance>Years pass>Sees JackSepticEye play it>All the memories flood back>One year passes in which i keep my eye on this game wait for the perfect opprotunity>That opprotunity comes when I see it's on sale for five dollars>Insantly buy it with no regrets.>The game is amazing, just like i knew it would be>Play the sh*t out of it for 2 days straight in which I kill EVERYONE>Start a new game on the third day>Becomes  the next hitler  Donald Trump and buys everything>To be continuedOn the real though, this game is a steal, even at it's normal price of 5 dollars. Did I love it? Hell yes I did. Do I miss the servers? Hell yes I do. BUT, maxis did such an amazing job with creature diversity that I honestly can still play the game with the creatures they made, and the ""Deja vu"" Creatures I made earlier. Would I reccommend it?

""Greater than the sum of its parts""Spore is less of a ""simulation game"" and more of an ""adventure through evolution"". The vision of Will Wright's epic ""Universe Simulator"" didn't turn out quite as many sims fans might expect. Now hold on, while I do not think Spore met its very high expectations set back circa E3 2005's demo, I did enjoy and love Spore.Spore is one part creation tool, one part action/adventure game and one part RTS game. The game is split into five stages, cell, creature, tribal, civilisation and space. The cell and creature stages play like a simple action RPG game, eating plants or killing/socialising with other creatures to raise your  ""level"" and unlock new parts as you evolve. Eventually your creature gains greater intelligence and moves to the tribal stage and civ stage where they play out like very simple RTS games and the Space stage return to a more action RPG format with some diplomacy sprinkled in. Each of these five stages are very simple, in fact they feel like far simpler versions of other games in the same genre. One could equate the cell stage as a very simplistic version of pacman, except with the lack of mazes. Your goal is simple: eat, grow big, and avoid ghosts - well in this case, predators, unless of course if you play a carnivore where your mission is to instead others. As a creature, the game shifts to a third person action RPG style game, depending on how your creature evolves, you gain different attacks and abilities to use as you fight of predators, socialise, or hunt down prey. At the tribal and civ stage, the games are very simple versions of Battle For Middle Earth. If you never played that very awesome Lord of the Rings based RTS game by EALA, you should definitely check it out. Ultimately though, each of these stages feel very bland and personally, lacks variety. While you creature creator allows you to make a variety of different creatures, the ability variety and units/building variety at civ stages are just too few. There's very little option for different strategies in any of these four stages. What makes up for it for me, is two things - the creature creator and the space stage. The creature creator is one of the best selling points of spore - who doesn't like to see your favourite fantasy creatures move and come to life? It is also nice to look at the timeline which your creature evolved, to see how they started from a single worm like cell with a glowing electric butt to a ferocious dragon thing wearing a top hat and sporting a beard (at least that's how my creature turned out) lel. The Space stage is perhaps the most fleshed out, and most satisfying stage to play in Spore. It is clearly the stage that Maxis put most time into. While there is no longer any evolution taking place, what makes the space stage so great is the blend of diplomacy, where you have to ally or fight off neigbouring alien empires, look for resources, spread your empire, abduct creatures from lesser civilisations for study or alternatively, lift them up to the space stage, terraform planets, or just drop a planet buster and blow them to bits. Space stage is most satisfying due to the greater level of difficulty, the things you have to manage and the variety of things to do. The first time you drop the atmosphere machine to pump a desolate planet full of air before throwing a down a blizzard machine to cool it down to the right temperature is so satisfying. What's  even more satisfying is deterraforming a planet - i.e. finding an alien empire and messing up their ecosystem and cause them to go extinct, I mean Why not!? Ha! (Goddam Zealots and their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Spode....)Individually, each stage of Spore is quite weak, but put together, Spore is definitely a very good game. And since most stage won't take you more than an hour to beat anyway, the lack of variety of the first four stages won't get too much in the way and you won't be bored by it because once you're done, you are doing something different in the next stage. I also recommend that if you get Spore, get it with Galactic Adventures because it introduces the adventure creator which is great fun and adds more variety to the missions you get to do at Space stage while simulataneously allowing you to land on certain planets to do missions controlling your character like during the creature stage.But, however I have only one final criticism, and this is aimed squarely at EA. Although I absolutely love Spore and want to give it greater praise, at the end of the day, I feel Spore is just very very poorly supported. The online search is absolutely atrocious. The in-game Sporepedia (which is a library of creatures and creations that users can upload) takes forever to load, there's frequent disconnections and for Galactic Adventures only, the points and ranking system for new adventures are completely and utterly broken. This is sad because Spore DOES have an active, albeit small, community who still creates great creatures and adventures.The verdict? Spore is a great game as a whole package where each stage works in unison to give a fun experience. As I said, the game doesn't take too long to move through each stage and seeing how your creature evolved over time is a satisfying experience. Ultimately however, had the game have better online functionality, like say Steamworkshop integration directly with Sporepedia, I would give this game a solid 8. Criticism of each stage being too simple aside, I did enjoy my hundreds of hours on this game creating things, and messing up and blowing up planets in space stage, finding secret space objects and flying through wormholes. It just made my inner science nerd fangasm as I live my sci-fi dreams. I just adore this game. However the poor online and very old community makes it very hard for me to reccommend today and ultimately I must drop a point and give this game a 7.tl;dr should you buy this game? Only at a sale and if you are okay with EA's terrible (or actually, completely nonexistent) support for this game. I'm still recommending it, but just barely and ONLY if you are okay with the nonexistent support from EA.			"

												Spore... Spore is an excellent concept, but the excecution is quite poor.The original idea could have been a masterpiece. The game changed for the worse, but still remains a half decent game, that I would certainly recommend buying, in a sale.  The creature design makes the game. It makes a ruined concept good. We have people making amazing things,  but if you want an anteater slug that can't defend itself, or a treeperson, then that can be done too.Buy this game at £15 if you want. But when it's cheaper, just buy it straight away.			"

												I've heard Spore was EA's last good game.They were right. The only bugs in this game are entertaining little physics glitches. Nothing too bad. Everything is very interactive.No Origin required. You can login to an EA account if you want, but you don't need to. Offline is just as satisfying.Anyways if you're creative and probably have good visions about what to make in this, go ahead; buy Spore.But if you suck at art, you'll probably settle with the worst amatuerish designs. You might hate yourself for making ""abominations of nature"". I sure didn't, cause I'm very artistic. I made an alien 4-horned Rhino. That's just my first creature and I'm gonna do a full playthrough with it. It's great!...but if any of you guys want, to... you know, mess around... you can make a creature that'll fart out it's mouth. I'd give it 10/10 except it doesn't have key-bind changing options.9/10			"

												The game itself is pretty straight-forward. Creating your own species is fun, finding parts to change your species (and its stats) feels fun and rewarding in its own way, and watching your species grow from single-celled organisms to walking/thinking/breathing land creatures is awesome.There are a few issues. Namely creature mobility in certain stages, and weird glitches in customization. I bought this for $5 and frankly, I would've easily paid a little more.The problem is there is no online multiplayer anymore, meaning some of the advertised features no longer work. All of the multplayer/online features involved finding player-created creatures/houses/buildings in your game. That's about it. Even with no multiplayer, the game is still fun.The last problem I have with the game is it's pretty short. Completionists can easily clear a majority of the game in under 10 hours. All in all, fun game, would recommend.			"

												(6.5/10) [65%]The Universe is HUGE.You build.evolve Your alien race in the first 35% of the game. The only use for all your hard work in the first part, is to have Your aliens and designs look a certain way, and unlocking the next part of the game. The rest of the game is pretty much diplomacy, terraforming and trading.The game does not have enough depth, for a space type sim.  You have to get to the center of the universe,  fighting off ""cyborg gremlins"".The game is worth-while playing, and fun. Sets the stage for cerebral expansion, and future thoughts.			"

												Don't let this account's playtime total fool you, I've been playing Spore since it was released and still haven't gotten bored of it. I love the diversity and, granted, it isn't as expansive as modern games, but it's still a lot of fun and I cannot get over it.I love the evolution of the species, how they build, the galaxy around the, the Grox, and trying to reach the center of the galaxy.Seriously, it's not a competitive game, it's not multiplayer, but it is awesome and I do enjoy just messing with it when I have the time.

												Spore is an amazing game, but EA has once again ♥♥♥♥ed those who love them and purchase games like spore and cut off all online features and support. This makes the Galactic Adventures DLC pretty much pointless and ruins it. But overall it's still an amazing intuitive game and will give you hours upon hours of fun. But due to the lack of online features anymore and lack of support I'd have to say only buy it if it's on sale.			"

												Program reputation for reliability - 6Fun - 9 Replay - 9 (I think the games gameplay-variety is responsible for such high replayability, but just low-effort guess)Depth - 8 (with lots of collecting, achievements, items, and parts thrown ontop of an already lengthy game, lots to do)Graphics - 7 (given the style, it hasn't aged poorly and is still easy on the eyes)Audio - 7 (quite good! and often pretty cute/disturbing as well)UI Ease - 6 (Some game mechanics are a little uncooperative and once identified, have to be in turn used against the AI. space combat comes to mind as does land-creature movement and tribal group and order management)DLC- I can't speak for the DLC. Unfortunately, ""signs point to no""Spore tends to get some mixed reviews, but between the yea and nae side, I'm definitely with the ""yea""s.Despite some rather nasty bugs I've seen reported (yet have never experienced myself across 3 different PC builds with 3 different versions of windows of the games era) and a few un-fulfilled promises about the amount and variety of gameplay Spore would have, it's still a wonderful game and fits into my collection quite nicely between SimLife, Civilization, and EscapeVelocity. I'm kinda dating myself a little with those references, but if you enjoyed those games or the genres they came from, then collectively you'll likely enjoy SporeYou start in a cellular / molecular stage which is...well...Sparkle2Evo...""thats all I got to say 'bout that.""Next, you're on land and as a walking, talking, biting creature have more of a ""squad leader & servants"" role to play in eating, killing, mating, and exploring your way through new body parts that offer bigger and better bonuses to gameplay.Then you move to a rudimentary Age of Empires tribal stage where you manage a small flock of your spawn and interract with (and ultimately ravage if ya play like me and always go the hostile route over the cuddly, fuzzy, social route which IS offered I might mention) other tribes of creatures.Then you hit the global ""Civilization"" stage where you're moving ground, air, and sea units to claim, control, and harvest resources while you devise the downfall or annexing of your neighboring nations.And last but certainly far from least, the space stage. This part of the game could have (and in the past, regularly was, and with great success; see EV:Nova) been its own full-production game. Exploring space, planet-scaping newly discovered worlds for colonization, a (rather awkward and sometimes uncooperative) combat system with various upgrades and features all coat this area of the game with a thick layer of nerdy OCD. Here you meet other species, conduct trade routes, colonize planets, establish automated trade routes, improve your ship, explore further and further and with more and more efficiency and profit making more and more homeworlds as you go for your species until...well....honestly I haven't gotten past this part. I enjoy it too much and haven't wanted it to end any of the half a dozen or so times I've played to this point and coasted along in place for a while before setting it down only to start over again later to replay it all.There have been many frustrations with this game for me, partly because I enjoyed it so much I didn't want anything to go wrong ever, most often it was due to a program crash that would hit me unexpectedly when I hadn't saved my game in a particularly productive couple of hours. But it was easily more a problem with my computers than it was the software itself.But that being said...I know the integrity of the program has been in question multiple times so...for some notable ratings...actually I suppose I'll put them at the top.

												Spore is a different kind of a free roaming game ( If you call it running around and between planets free roaming ) in which evolution is key. You must begin you life as a cell and eventually become the overlord of space, or the diplomat of the galaxy. The creature you play is entirely custom and can be anything you want. Spore offers a new kind of freedom which lured me in. <END>			"

												Spore is an amazing game, but EA has once again ♥♥♥♥ed those who love them and purchase games like spore and cut off all online features and support. This makes the Galactic Adventures DLC pretty much pointless and ruins it. But overall it's still an amazing intuitive game and will give you hours upon hours of fun. But due to the lack of online features anymore and lack of support I'd have to say only buy it if it's on sale.			"

												I'd say Spore is just about good, because of its detailed creature/building/vehicle creation. The first four stages are fun to play, but the space stage gets extremely boring very quickly - it is mostly just about going around dumping colony packs everwhere you go, and then going back to your planets to collect ""spice"". Its worth playing if you like games with plenty of user created content, but those looking for an exiting strategy game should go to civilization or something of the like. The space stage does get significantly better with the Galactic Adventures dlc, though not really enough to make it fun. The game also has good mod-ability, but modding can damage your ability to use the online aspects of the game.			"

												I've played Spore since I can remember, you start off as a tiny insignificant cell untill you get to the space stage where you conquer empires and rule the entire galaxy.You can look up at planets in your solar system in creature stage and then visit them closer up in the end stage and explore them, change the atmosphere, add creatures and change the terrain. If you want to, you can choose to stay in one stage and max out your creature and destroy, or befriend  different creatures. (you can always continue to the next stage if you continue though)Everytime I play Spore I realize that my creations look better everytime I play the game, therefore I can say that the game promotes creativity.I would definetly recommend this game to everyone. Never gets old. 10/10			"

												Spore is a unique game. It lets you create your own species and evolve them from microscopic cells, to a space-fairing empire. As you go along each stage, you get to use a powerful editor that lets you create virtualy anything you want. You could create something out of Mass Effect or Halo, or whatever you want. Imagination is the limit! When not in the editors, you will be spending time in Spore's 5 different stages. Each stage has its own kind of gameplay, giving you different genres of playstyle. I enjoyed all of the stages, but thre were a few problems I had. The lack of an auto save feature can be annoying at times. The gme sometimes crashes and  when I forget to save, I lose alot or all progress. (So remember to save) Another problem I had was in tribal stage were my tribe's men wouldn't harvest meat from hunting. (This wasn't too big a deal, I just restarted the game and it was fixed) There are a few bugs here and there, but they shouldn't be gamebreaking. Overall, this is one of my favorite games. (If you like this game, be sure to heck out it's other awesome dlcs.)			"

												What the ♥♥♥♥ did you just ♥♥♥♥ing say about me, you little cel? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Civilization stage, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on opposing cities, and I have over 30 confirmed cities. I am trained in creature stage warfare and I’m the top species on my hard mode planet. You are nothing to me but just another herbivorous scum. I will wipe your entire species the ♥♥♥♥ out with my top predatory skills the likes of which have never been seen before in this entire galaxy, mark my ♥♥♥♥ing words. You think you can get away with saying that ♥♥♥♥ to me over the communicator? Think again, ♥♥♥♥er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of allied aliens across the galaxy and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the invasion, scum. The invasion that wipes out the pathetic little cel you call your life. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways with my terraforming tools and gadgets, and that’s not all I can even beat you to a pulp just with my bare claws. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of Space stage gizmos and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ♥♥♥ off the face of your native planet, you little ♥♥♥♥. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” remorse was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your ♥♥♥♥ing tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the sporebucks, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot. I will shine fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re ♥♥♥♥ing dead, kiddo. P.S. Don't you dare touch my spice planets, k thanks.			"

												Program reputation for reliability - 6Fun - 9 Replay - 9 (I think the games gameplay-variety is responsible for such high replayability, but just low-effort guess)Depth - 8 (with lots of collecting, achievements, items, and parts thrown ontop of an already lengthy game, lots to do)Graphics - 7 (given the style, it hasn't aged poorly and is still easy on the eyes)Audio - 7 (quite good! and often pretty cute/disturbing as well)UI Ease - 6 (Some game mechanics are a little uncooperative and once identified, have to be in turn used against the AI. space combat comes to mind as does land-creature movement and tribal group and order management)DLC- I can't speak for the DLC. Unfortunately, ""signs point to no""Spore tends to get some mixed reviews, but between the yea and nae side, I'm definitely with the ""yea""s.Despite some rather nasty bugs I've seen reported (yet have never experienced myself across 3 different PC builds with 3 different versions of windows of the games era) and a few un-fulfilled promises about the amount and variety of gameplay Spore would have, it's still a wonderful game and fits into my collection quite nicely between SimLife, Civilization, and EscapeVelocity. I'm kinda dating myself a little with those references, but if you enjoyed those games or the genres they came from, then collectively you'll likely enjoy SporeYou start in a cellular / molecular stage which is...well...Sparkle2Evo...""thats all I got to say 'bout that.""Next, you're on land and as a walking, talking, biting creature have more of a ""squad leader & servants"" role to play in eating, killing, mating, and exploring your way through new body parts that offer bigger and better bonuses to gameplay.Then you move to a rudimentary Age of Empires tribal stage where you manage a small flock of your spawn and interract with (and ultimately ravage if ya play like me and always go the hostile route over the cuddly, fuzzy, social route which IS offered I might mention) other tribes of creatures.Then you hit the global ""Civilization"" stage where you're moving ground, air, and sea units to claim, control, and harvest resources while you devise the downfall or annexing of your neighboring nations.And last but certainly far from least, the space stage. This part of the game could have (and in the past, regularly was, and with great success; see EV:Nova) been its own full-production game. Exploring space, planet-scaping newly discovered worlds for colonization, a (rather awkward and sometimes uncooperative) combat system with various upgrades and features all coat this area of the game with a thick layer of nerdy OCD. Here you meet other species, conduct trade routes, colonize planets, establish automated trade routes, improve your ship, explore further and further and with more and more efficiency and profit making more and more homeworlds as you go for your species until...well....honestly I haven't gotten past this part. I enjoy it too much and haven't wanted it to end any of the half a dozen or so times I've played to this point and coasted along in place for a while before setting it down only to start over again later to replay it all.There have been many frustrations with this game for me, partly because I enjoyed it so much I didn't want anything to go wrong ever, most often it was due to a program crash that would hit me unexpectedly when I hadn't saved my game in a particularly productive couple of hours. But it was easily more a problem with my computers than it was the software itself.But that being said...I know the integrity of the program has been in question multiple times so...for some notable ratings...actually I suppose I'll put them at the top.

												I cannot recommend this game in it's current state. It will freeze up and crash on me every 30 to 90 minutes. I've done the end of the creature stage 4 times now and the beginning of the tribal stage 2 to 3 times. I've finally realized that I need to just save it every 10 minutes, but it is very frustrating.For the actual gameplay, it is an incredible game. The process and method used to develop your species is absolutely phenonmenal and I am loving it thus far. I cannot wait to get to the end of the tribal stage and grow into an almighty civilization. I have no doubt it will be a lot of fun when I get there, but I hate the fact that this game freezes and crashes so often with no error message or anything of the nature.I want to recommend this game so badly as it is built so well, but the crashes are too huge a turn off for me.

												Spore mysteriously crashed on my computer several times, letting me only play for a maximum of 10 minutes per reboot. I figured out that spore somehow corrupts it's datafiles, so saving is not an option if the game crashes, I had to start at every stage and end at a fourth way through it. ( Except for cell, I got half-way through it. ) I woul dnot recommend this game until this is fixed. Everything else is fine with me.			"

												Do NOT buy this game if you are running Windows 7 64bit or whatsoever. The game is broken, and cannot be fixed properly, and since there is no refunds, you would be giving your cash for a product that leaves you with regret and remorse. They wont help you in any way. I just took 30 minutes just messing up with registry and moving the game-files only to find out that I cant change any parts of the creatures, and the game freezes after 5 minutes of playing (first time you get to ""mod"" your creatures).

Product received for free
												Spore is a fun little game, very similar to Sims (Both developed by Maxis). Although there are a lot of bugs (See what I did there?), the game is still enjoyable and most issues are easily resolved. The graphics aren't too bad and each evolutionary stage offers a different type of gameplay, each are enjoyable, though some more than others. The first stage is somewhat like the popular app Agar.io, then, what lured me into the game was the creature stage; creating your very own monster. Then a little bit of strategy and finally you get to travel into space and discover planets etc.Whilst the game looks like it was designed to appeal to children (probably was) I'm sure anyone can get some enjoyment from it.7.5/10			"

												The Good: You might enjoy this game if you're really into the idea of customizing and tweaking your creature. Or if you're just looking for a very casual game to enjoy without much of a learning curve.The Bad: What I wanted out of spore though was the feeling of starting from a single celled organism and eventually taking over the entire planet and/or galaxy. And while spore attempts to do this, it doesn't feel epic in any way. It just feels like a series of very simplistic minigames. It didn't feel very rewarding to win.On top of that the mechanics didn't feel very crisp. Even after 13 hours of play I still didn't feel like I grasped the mechanics very well.			"

												The novelty of being able to create your own creatures is amazing and fun for a while. However, since EA shut down it's servers for the game and it has no mod support, it simply isn't worth buying as it gets stale very quickly. The game tries to be too many games at once, and doesn't go past surface level on any of its different ""phases"". Honestly it's only fun with some friends so you can mess around and make extremely ugly creatures. Which means past the creature stage it loses all charm and becomes a forgetable ""4x"", if it even counts as that. Don't buy unless you have nothing else worth buying and it's on sale.			"

												The game is divided into 5 stages, and each stage features a somewhat different style of gameplay. Most are like real-time strategy, but they are different and diverse. So it's basically 5 games in one pack. Not only that, the whole game is about your very own creature evolving from one single cell to the biggest race that controls the whole universe. It feels EPIC. It feels like you are the god.The space stage, being the last stage, is immense with content, and endless. Everyone talks about this epic journey into the heart of galaxy, because it's fantastic. It can get very hard, with the Grox attacking you in laaaarge numbers. You have to tear out a way the hard way, planet by planet, among heavily occupied star systems. But when you do reach the center, you get this feeling again that after billions of years of evolving and fighting and growing you finally become the emperor of the universe. It is moving, trust me. And aside from this main quest (it may not even be main - the game doesn't require you to do this), there are tons of things to do. You can collect artifacts from around the galaxy, ally or fight with other equally advanced races, work toward various badges and unlock the very best equipment, play the financial way by trading spices, and so much more.At the end of each stage, you get an ability based on your behavior in this stage to help you with the next stage. If you are violent you get an ability that attacks. If you are social you get an ability that helps making friends. And if you play from the very first cell stage all the way to space, you get an ultimate ability for the space stage. There are a good number of different abilities you can get this way, and they create a good number of various playstyles. Conclusion, what you do as a cell at day 1 will affect what you do outside of your home planet.And of course there's this famed creature creator. You can create EVERYTHING with it. And not only creatures, but also houses, factories, turrets, vehicles, ships, planes, spaceships, and more. WIth Internet connection you can share your creations with other players. In fact these guys at EA are so proud of this creator that they make it one option at the main menu. Yes you can go to the creator and start creating without launching the main game at all.So is there any complaint at all? Well there is. At whatever stage, if you make a lot of allies, you will be annoyed at how they keep attacking one another and seeking help from you all the time. Makes me think back to Civilization. Can't they just learn to live in peace, like me?! And when I first installed the game it says my key wasn't valid. But just contact EA and they can solve this quickly.All in all, this game is marvelous, and is recommended for everyone.Edit: well seems like online action has been dead for some time. Sorry for the inaccuracy. And here I thought there's this magical guy named Maxis who created a lot and lot and lot of things. Other than that this game still rocks.+ epic adventure+ variety of playstyle+ creativity- first 4 stages are too short10 out of 10, masterpiece.			"

												The Good: You might enjoy this game if you're really into the idea of customizing and tweaking your creature. Or if you're just looking for a very casual game to enjoy without much of a learning curve.The Bad: What I wanted out of spore though was the feeling of starting from a single celled organism and eventually taking over the entire planet and/or galaxy. And while spore attempts to do this, it doesn't feel epic in any way. It just feels like a series of very simplistic minigames. It didn't feel very rewarding to win.On top of that the mechanics didn't feel very crisp. Even after 13 hours of play I still didn't feel like I grasped the mechanics very well.			"

												The novelty of being able to create your own creatures is amazing and fun for a while. However, since EA shut down it's servers for the game and it has no mod support, it simply isn't worth buying as it gets stale very quickly. The game tries to be too many games at once, and doesn't go past surface level on any of its different ""phases"". Honestly it's only fun with some friends so you can mess around and make extremely ugly creatures. Which means past the creature stage it loses all charm and becomes a forgetable ""4x"", if it even counts as that. Don't buy unless you have nothing else worth buying and it's on sale.			"

												All I can say about this game is its REALLY GOOD. But the dev probably forgot about this game which really sucks because i had so much fun playing this game for HOURS and i didnt get bored at all. But after a while everything starts to be a little empty and the creators should fix that about the game. But its too late to make a huge update thats why we need a sequal and it would be sooo satisfying to see that happen because this is my favourite game and i cant play it because im afraid that i will get bored... Wha im trying to say is please make this game better so we can enjoy it  there is only 12 parts for the cell stage and thats it... you guys should be adding to this game. We dont care about sims 5 just make spore better again :P			"

												Please, if you're reading this, GET THIS GAME. This is one of the brightest, best, most ingenius games of all time. I don't know what you're thinking it looks like, but once you play it through, you'll know why many call this a ""Masterpiece"".Don't be fooled by my hours. I played this long just to write a review. I have had this game since it's release in 2007/2008 and along with that used the expansion pack Galactic Adventures.Sometime in this world, this game will climb from the grave of olden forgotten games and rise above all in a blinding light. It will look down upon the next generation of gamers and wave its finger. It will bathe them all in its healing glow, and the unfathomable legend that is Spore will ask them; ""How will you create the universe?""With that out of the way, let's get to some points.GOOD:- Open the game. Look at the title screen. Put your hands around the screen as devilish or heroic you want. YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE GALAXY TO COMPLETELY CHANGE TO YOUR VERY OWN WILL.- I recommend this game.- You can change anything. Literally. Serious here. Except plants. Sky? Water? Land formations? Vehicles? Your face? A city and it's entire layout? How about the song that plays in cities 24/7 and tortures it's civilians? Make it as monotonous as you wish. Oh, you can also change other planets. Don't have to be yours.- Funny. Oh, no I don't mean the game's humor. No, I don't mean giant walking pink floppy things. I mean: you have to get used to this game and know how it works. When something goes wrong or stupid, you'll know. xD- I recommend this game.- Plenty of glitches to exploit the creators to make some pretty cool looking stuff.- Classic RPG feel but without an annoying ""Level""ing system.- If the community was active, it has a very flexible way to find other people's stuff and do things with it. ^^- GET THIS GAME ALREADY.- Play this game. Make stuff. Make it evolve. Click the timeline button. CRY LIKE YOU'VE NEVER DONE BEFORE.I feel like I'm betraying 9 years of my life and my favorite game of all time by writing this, but...BAD:- The community is D.E.A.D. Which is why we need to CHANGE THAT.- No multiplayer. Boo. :<However, along with no multiplayer, you can still access, comment, message, all that good stuff to people you're friends with in the game. Put their creations in your own little world and DESTROY THEM!Somewhere out there, there are still people making stuff. Well. Besides me.			"

												I liked this game for many reasson, it has unlimited replayability with every experience being new. To me that is vital in a game. While it may say I only have 27 hours I have well over a 500 or so as I got it when I was just a kid and played on CD for many years. Enough about me though, we are talking about the game. This game has had many issues with it along with many pros. When it was first released there was much back lash on the scientific problems with the game. Such as how the comets tails face the wrong way and a lot of people felt as if they were cheated. From what I understand this was advertised as The Sims only in a global way. custimization and such was supposed to be through the roof while it may apeearr not true I find it to be as close to that as it can be. For the technology that was available when the game was produced.       The game was far ahead of its time and if remade with modern technology it would take the world by storm. I would not be suprised if No Mans Sky got ideas from this game. Finding houndreds of creatures that the creators have made and back when multiplayer was still supported you could find an endless amount from simple to very complex creatures, maybe even considered artistic. I can still remember one I found named boot wjich indeed looked like a boot to every detail. That is the thing about the game. You can slap on the best parts and have a beast machine but you will most likely not like it asthetically.      The Pros:               Replayability, cheap, imaginative      The Cons:               Cartoonish, and space age. The Cons (explained)    While the cartoony graphics may push off more mature players my younger self did not care. They can be a bit hard to get use to and may drive some off but maybe not. My big issue is the Space age stage. While everyone is different I find it to be the worst part about the game and it makes up well over 70% of a play through if not more. The space is is grindy and very very long. It makes up for it by having a lot to do I find it to be to drug out. You can only buy planets at such a rate and travel so far with out going to war for resources or to level up. For instance on the 27 hours I have on here roughly 20 or more were in the space age and I have got alomost nowhere. That may be me though I know people who hate it and people who love it.Anyway I would rate the game a solid 8/10 because if you do not like the space age you can always restart.  "

												Yes, this game was a disapointment during development and had an amazing amount of potential, but this should not be a factor in whether THIS game is good or not. I will tell you what's good and bad about this game with as little bias possible.In short. It can be a fun early game, but expect to steadily become annoyed by gameplay.If you think it would be fun to create your own civilization of alien creatures and put detailed work into their architecture, vehicle design, and ideology(kinda); this is the game for you. If you want to rush through everything and make your tanks floating white cubes, then you're better spending your money on something else. This game is more like a toybox than a video games. It can be a lot of fun only if you have an active imagination.Personally, vehicle creation is what I've had the most fun with. You can make some amazing stuff if you put some work into it. I've seen a creation someone made of the Pelican from HALO and it looks freaking awesome. Or you could make a flying d*** plane like most people seem to make.Now the downside:The stages from cell->creature->tribe->civilization->space are incredibly rushed. You can get by cell stage in 10 minutes and the creature, tribe, and civilization stages might take you an hour each if you're taking your sweet time. From this it seems like the developers thought that the space stage should consist of the majority of your gameplay. I loved the civilization stage, but it sucks so much how much that it's rushed. If you've been sitting around enough with a fair amount of cities, other civilization will even go ""**** it. I'm gonna give you all my cities"" as if they're rage quiting. There is literally no strategy to warfare at all. All that matters is who has the most units. Other civilizations aren't even that violent either. They just sit there all game waiting for you to either throw bibles, bullets, or money at them (keep in mind, this is NORMAL difficulty). Space:Now the biggest problem with space age is that there is literally no automization whatsoever. Your planet could be covered in turrets and have a uber turret and if a pirate or whatever attacks the planet and you're not there to overlook it, the planet will either suffer lots of damage or be lost. I just want to adventure from star to star and my star citizens will scream at me to stop biodisasters or kill pirates every 2 minutes. Other nations can send entire fleets of ships to take over your planet, but whenever you want to take over one, you have to do it aaaalll by yourself (and a few allied ships if you have them).To developers:Is it so hard to program automatic trading between your stars? Is it so hard to let my planets defend themselves with their own weapons? The scope of the game gets bigger and bigger as you play yet management has stayed the same as it has in cell stage.It dissapoints me that this game isn't very good. I love every idea this game has to offer, but everything is so poorly executed. If there were a remake of this game where it's made realisitc looking with in-depth stages, I would buy it in a heartbeat. Recommendation: If this game is $5, go nuts.  "

												Well this was the biggest 60/40 game I have ever seen. The first 3 stages of the game ( cell, creature, and tribe ) are very good and kept me playing. But the civlization is stupid thanks to camera control and contest crafting and future gets boring very fast. It does have replayability in the first 3 and I think I will come back to create different creatures very soon. But those last 2 stages are impossible to get through. Think of it like this, when I was on the first 3 stages it was 4 straight hours of fun. Got into civilization, constent pausing, to exiting, to playing a better game. I recommend purchase but only around $10.00 to make sure you get the enjoyment of the first 3 stages and see if you like the last 2.NOTE IF YOU HAVE WINDOWS: If you once at anytime click the windows button it will knock you out of the game and you will be stuck ( usually in ground ) for ever on any game level except cellular. In short save often or it's a reset.My score: 6/10 above average			"

												Trying to contact support was like trying to dash towards a train while the doors were closing, if the window of oppoortunity shuts in your face, you will be finding yourself at the station waiting for the next chance to come along, especially since there have no way to actually email them. Even when I arrive at the station, I will at times glitch out and disconnect, having to log back in several times to enter.Getting in the game was a chore, but I remained optimistic to see what they would pull off by making several genres combine into a concept of evolution with large end game content. The excitement faded over time, as I realized after each stage that it was getting more shallow than the previous, the worst being the RTS stage before you reach the end game.The RTS stage being the most clearly basic and clunky form of AI this game has to offer you, beating the goals of this evolution stage are extremely easy. With one entertainment building you can maximize profit in every city with ease, while keeping your citizens happiness neutral. This made it apparent that having multiple genres and treating them like mini-games that you do for end game content, was in essence a foolish move. The customization itself is rather a shallow husk, adding several guns, rockets, and flamethrowers to a tank won't result in any increased power, its like if I was watching ""The Mask"" as a child again. Even in earlier stages where you can customize your spore it didn't result in any actual difference in how well it fought against the other dinosaurs. The customization ends up as a purely cosmetic concept, lucky for us they aren't charging it as DLC at least...The game still has hindering glitches after all these years was also not a good sign of their support for the game. Crashing right after dying in the creature stage for example has been around since release and still hasn't been addressed properly. Don't buy it unless you can get a massive discount.The only positive thing about this game is the humor and cutenessSo basically:- External DRM.- Extremely minimalistic and dumbeddown game, aimed at casuals.- Almost all creature and vehicle customizations (what the game is all about) are PURELY cosmetics only...- Lots of issues, bugs and connection problems.- Transition into RTS seems like an extremely bad Civilization type of game as if it was put together in a month time.- Devs ignore gamebreaking bugs like crashes entirely. They release a lot of DLC but will probably never fix it. They are too busy 'making money'.			"

												I contemplated for a long should I get this game since it seemed rather childish but a friend recommended it. In the end i grabbed it from the sale. I'm torn 50/50 recommending it, and not recommending. Yeah it is pretty childish and naive, yet you can have fun with it. I'm sure if I had kids they would have a blast with it.The cell stage was great, I wish it would have lasted like that with the slow evolutions way longer. I liked the swift swimming and exploring. On tribal part it gets a bit ""meh"", with loads of tribes annoying you until you befriend them or get rid of them, and after that even more so until you get into space age - and there I think I spent hours on hours building my empire, just to learn how vast and endless the galaxy was, staring at it both in awe and disapointment. Due some crashes and corrupted files I played to galaxy stage 3 times, each a bit different, and to my amusement kept running to my old creations quite a lot in the new worlds.After few playtimes I don't think I will ever open the game again though, and the creatures sounds and screams annoy me immensely by now. I didn't figure out how to set default buildings in galaxy so every time I take over a new planet I am forced to repick the building which is just futile. Endlessly so. And you have to do everything by ""yourself"" with that one little ship, making ruling over your great empire tiresome and expanding just makes it more so. There is kinda no end to it so it just wears you out in the end. I wanted to add an edit since so many are finding this review so horribly unhelpful. My playtime is  high because I kept leaving the game open when I wasn't playing, since it would so often crash and destroy my saved game when I closed it, therefore forcing me to start over repeatedly or roll back a lot. I didn't feel like giving up before reaching the end and seeing all there was to it, I guess I'm curious like that. This is however really not a hallmark of a good game, nor a sign that I ""got my moneys worth in time spent"", if that is what bugs you guys in this review.			"

												Extremely disappointed with this game, Steam and EA games.  Purchased this game and all the expansion packs which was very pricy.  The first portion of the game worked, but I could not sign up online and could not use the expansion packs at all.  I didn't know that I was not playing the expansion packs or that there was an online portion until after I reached a certain point in the game which was over the 10 hour limit by one extra hour.I contacted Steam support to let them know the issue.  They said that they no longer support EA Spore game.  Keep in mind I just purchased this a day before asking Steam for help.I then went ahead and contacted EA games.  They said in the chat window there was only a 5 minute wait.  It has been weeks and still no reply.  I called and still no answer on the phone from EA games.  Is this a joke?  I feel like I got scammed.  What is worse is that Steam is STILL selling this game.  If they don't support EA games, they should not be selling this.  Especially with all the other complaints from other players.This does not work with most recent version of Windows, but I am running this game on Windows 7 and still have issues.I will never purchase another game from Steam or EA games if this is how they treat customers.

												Quite honestly all this game is is a wasteland of ignored oppurtunity. Sure, it's fun, but to an extent. There's only so many parts you can use, and there's even less with the C&C expansion pack. The only way to expand on this (besides buying their overpriced underpacked expansions) is to download mods, and even then you're gonna have to find a way to force save creatures because the game refuses to save them. I wouldn't recommend this product at full price, just wait for a sale or for someone to get you a key for it (hint hint♥♥♥♥♥			"

												Wow, I bought this game thinking evolutionary decisions made will have some great impact througout the game.  It doesn't.The game really doesn't leave room for diversity.  Despite having so many choices, most of them becomes a mute issue in the next minigame (there are 5 such minigames, each one having little to do with each other).  Ultimately, you have to somehow subdue the opponents either through might or culture, but playstyle for both method is rather identical, hence the lack of actual diversified game play.  Each of the minigame weren't really polished either.  Controls are one thing; AI responses or ally reactions are poor and unrealiable.  Indeed, this game is a cohort of five mediocre games of 2008.  I've seen much better games in 1990's.Many people like it.  Well, there may be good reason for it, and for such info, go read their reviews.  As for me, after playing it through a couple times, all of which were done rather painfully hoping to be proven wrong, well, I am done trying.  I wish I could get a refund, but thankfully, I bought it on sale.			"

												4 out of 10Spore is not really a great game.  It is not totally horrible, ""avoid at all cost"", bad either.  The gameplay itself gets stale very quickly.You control a critter(s) through evolution into tribal and industrial age into the space age.  The space age is by far the best.  (I have the Galactic Adventures Pack DLC not sure what the difference is). The good:1. You can design your own critters and later on vehicles with infinite possibilities.  It did not appeal much to me though. 2. The idea is good.  The implementation not so much. The bad: 3. It is nothing like real evolution.  In the evolutionary stages you can totally change your critter's characteristics in an instant.  Evolution is small changes cumulative over many generations. 4. The game play will not keep you entertained for long.  The evolutionary lines are too similar.  Re-playability is limited. 5. Some more AI automation in the space age would have been useful.  You have to do basically everything manually.  And there is a hell of a lot of menial stuff to do. The ugly: 6. It is one of those games were doing something seemingly simple could take hours (in the space age, the other ages are not so bad). There is nothing out there I know off remotely like this.  Ultimately the gameplay is very simplistic.			"

I got my copy off of the Humble Bundle a while back, and now that I'm trying to play it, I come to realize the key is in use already. Apparently the only way to ""fix"" this is to go through a lengthy process with EA support, which I'm not going to do seeing that I got this game with a bundle anyways.			"

												I'm not sure how validly I can review this game, given that I've never even beaten the Tribal Stage. This doesn't bother me personally so much as I think the Tribal Stage is rubbish compared to the Creature Stage, which is the concept that drew me in to begin with.The creature stage itself is plenty of fun, if a bit limited by the fact that succeeding in socialization encounters at all basically means you need to have mastery of every single form of communication, and the fact that there's no need to adapt to any particular climate or change in climate. Sure that allows for more freedom in design, but shouldn't the core concept of a game that can be summed up as ""Evolution Lite"" be coming up with creatures that are both awesome AND can survive the challenges the world throws at them?If you already have it, awesome, but I wouldn't recommend throwing money at this game. Better to watch and see if someone can do it better next time around.			"

It's glitchy, and the controls are iffy at best. The camera in the later stages is a pain in the neck to work with. The worst part is that the game is no longer supported by either EA Support or the Spore team itself. The servers have been down since 2014, so none of the online content is available. And the worst part is that after four hours of troubleshooting, I can't get a refund.A huge dissapointment, and I would not reccomend this to anyone who wants to keep their sanity.			"

												To you people who were curious about this game, DON'T GET IT. I discovered that this game is terrible first hand. Shift + Tab crashes the game EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I can't stress it enough, DON'T BUY THIS WORTHLESS EXCUSE FOR A GAME.			"

												I've played the game on a friend's computer before, and it was fun. I really enjoyed it.Then I bought it.The game won't save without crashing first, so I lose all my progress. It's glitchy, and the controls are iffy at best. The camera in the later stages is a pain in the neck to work with. The worst part is that the game is no longer supported by either EA Support or the Spore team itself. The servers have been down since 2014, so none of the online content is available. And the worst part is that after four hours of troubleshooting, I can't get a refund.A huge dissapointment, and I would not reccomend this to anyone who wants to keep their sanity.			"

												SPORE(tm) is a game based around creating your own creature, growing from a tiny little cell into a run-of-the-mill alien creature which roams the wildlife. When the time comes your flock of creatures will assemble a tribe, which turns into a civilization where you conquer your planet and begin to rule other planets. The concept seems solid, but if only EA and Maxis didn't royally ♥♥♥♥ this idea in the♥♥♥♥♥ My main issue with this SPORE(tm) is when each stage of the game passes, the core gameplay drastically changes.The cell stage is a top-down hold your mouse down to let your cell munch on some food and take on other cells, this isn't entirely bad as it gives you a rundown on how the game works and how to use character creation.The Creature stage is the best part of the game bar-none, you roam around a titan of a planet, populated by other player's spore creations and creatures made by Maxis. Your goal is to collect food, make friends or enemies and collect bones/fossils to help your creature evolve(Find new body parts), during this stage you'll be taking on agressive nests of creatures, rogue creatues who have mastered their ability to fight and the all-mighty epic giants which roam and demolish anything within it's path.After that, SPORE(tm) takes you into the Tribal stage, which returns you to a top-down perspective and plays like an RTS, build your village and either make peace with or destroy any other tribes on the planet.Civilization's stage of the game is the exact same as the Tribal stage, difference being you suddenly gain ludicrous technology and turn into a traitorous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ by killing off any friends you made to rule the planet you once lived on.And finally there's space, I think you get the idea now.What EA was going for with spore didn't work at all, changing up the gameplay entirely is one of the worst things a game could do and is by far the best way to ♥♥♥♥ one up. Personally I wish they stuck with the Creature stages' sort of gameplay, moving into a tribal stage with the same perspective and having the ability to take on tougher creatures on the planet, while maintaining resources in your village, then moving on to civilisation, having even more resorces to work with and have a fair fight against creatures such as epics. Ruling the planet in that sort of way (The space stage truly wasn't necessary)Oh well, you can't get what you want all the time.I'd recommend this game if it was on sale, such as a 75% off just for the creature stage and phenominally hilarious laughs you can get out of it. Otherwise I wouldn't tell you to buy this game, even at gunpoint.			"

												I rate this game at about $8, and that's with the Creepy&Cute DLC (which adds nothing of value). Given that its normal price is $20 ($30 with the DLC), it would take a pretty big Steam sale to make this game worth getting.What they did is make 5 half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥mini-games, each one a different game genre, and combine them into a single game that progresses & evolves your creature through each mini-game. None of the 5 mini-games is much fun on its own. Just when one of them seems like it's about to get fun, you're done with it and have to go on to the next.The cell stage is so short and limited that it could be a Flash game. In fact, I have played many Flash games that have much more depth and enoyability than this mini-game.The creature stage is actually pretty fun the first time through, but slogging through the unlocks is not even remotely fun a second time, even if you make completely different choices.Tribal stage is a really simplistic RTS that you beat in minutes.Civilization stage is almost a 4X, except there's no ""explore"", ""exploit"", and not much of an ""expand"" among those 4 Xs, and diplomacy is barely a thing (though I admit I wouldn't know, as I just conquered everyone).The space stage is a more complete 4X, except you have to slowly fly your ship to any civilization/colony you want to interact with. On top of that, your one ship is the only unit you can ever really control. This portion of the game never ends - you just keep flying your ship around and doing the same boring stuff forever. The galaxy is pretty massive, which is good, but the limit to how much you can do in it, along with the tedium of flying your ship around, pretty much eliminates the appeal of the large scale.The lesson here is when you make 1/5th of 5 different games, then smush them together, you don't actually get a whole game. Sorry Maxis. The only way an idea like this could work is if each of the 5 mini-games was fleshed out and felt like a full game on its own.			"

												Really good game with lot content to do, but it has flaws. when i reach space stage, i can play only around 30 mins-1 hour, and then game crashes. i had this game as pirate few years ago and it kept crashing even more often than purchased one. its kinda annoying that you just have captured another planet, and when you exit the planet to savem game crashes and you lose hour of work. But anyways. If you need game to play and you are into sandbox-create-everything-you-want game, this is it.			"

												a weird hybrid of pokemon, civilisation, and a weird art program that's sophisticated enough to make anything you could want. i like using it to make stuff for roleplaying. combat is abit like an oldschool mmo very basic skills with a pokemo nlike feel where you can make your creature better and have more abilities. but unless you also have the galatic adventures expansion, there isn't any real need to invest in your diy fakemon's combat abilities as the endgame is all about galatic conquest with your custom designed buildings and vehicles. only downside is trying to log into the server for online content. it's completely optional though not fun if you have a friend you like trading fakemon with and having login issuesbtw. most of my hours were spent playing through the creepy and cute expansions so that's why playtime is recorded as so low. i highly recommend getting both expansions with this game			"

												Bought this game to catch up on space colonization type games. Summary: It's a grindfest. Repetitive, simple, not fun.You ""evolve"" a creature through various stages. It starts out very simple as the different game types are mini games. Only the mini games become longer and longer, and their complexity stays that of mini games. There is no depth. The final space age takes this to the extreme.Example 1: Every colony you build (3 per planet), you have to drag and drop 8 turrets halfway accross the screen, then you have to set 3 factories, 1 entertainment building and about 7 houses in a simple pattern (again by drag and drop halfway across the screen). Then, if your planet is attacked, you should also check each colony individually by flying to each one in your space ship, and replace any lost buildings by drag and drop halfway accross the screen.Example 2: The enemy ""AI"" doesn't rebuild. To take an enemy planet, fly there, destroy some buildings, fly back to base, refuel, do some missions/alerts/trades in between (because they keep piling up), refuel again, fly to the enemy planet, destroy some more buildings, repeat until planet surrenders.Example 3: In the 4th stage, there is 1 land unit, which will be replaced with 1 air unit when air units become available.Example 4: In the 3rd stage, the only way to wipe out an enemy tribe is to wait for them to attack you, kill the attacker with your special ability, then wipe out the remaining enemies at their camp. Repeat 4 times.There are a few things that hurt the game apart from the boring gameplay:- It occasionally crashes, but  rarely enough that it's acceptable. Except that there are no autosaves. It only asks you to save on exit (unless it crashes).- Login is very annoying. You need an EA account. Not sure what for, since there's absolutely no online content (was removed from the game after release).- Controls in the 5 stages have nothing in common, except that they all work with mouse and an optional keyboard. It seems the 5 mini games have been designed by completely different teams.This game is not made for adults or adolescents, it's made for kids - and for kids there's no educational value, unlike Civilization, which I played at 10. If you expect a game even remotely similar to Civ, Homeworld, MoO2, or C&C, this game is nothing like any of them. I cannot recommend this game even on a sale, unless you buy it for the creature editor. There are plenty of free to play games that are better, and hundreds of 2$ strategy titles on GoG that are a couple leagues above Spore.			"

												I only recently have gotten past the tribal stage because I had to restart the ♥♥♥♥ing game more times than it takes your mum to cook my eggs right. Speaking of the tribal stage, ♥♥♥♥ it. It's the most boring thing on earth. What with its slow♥♥♥♥♥battles and facebook tier fill-bars.But when you get past that, and into the civilization part, the game is actually good. Making your own vehicles is fun, driving them around is more fun, and blitzkrieging the entire planet with them is even more fun.So, get this game if you are either a sadomasochist or an aspiring despotic tyrant.

												The controls are good overall and the game does give lots of play time, however, the complexity meter is just a pain, the game already has a cap in what you can buy via dna points in the early stages and the circles in the later stages, why does it need yet another cap?			"

												I've gotten about halfway through the game as of the time I'm writing this, and I think the game does have some value to it, but I'm gonna have to give this one a ""not recommend"" but with a bit of a clause...See, what Spore tries to do is combine several different genres of games into one. Sounds like a great idea right? But what happens if you dislike one of those genres? Well this is what my experience with Spore has been. The first two ""stages"" of the game were a lot of fun. It was great creating a species, watching it evolve, and murdering or befriending (mostly murdering) other critters. Unfortunately this fun all came to a screeching halt for me on stage 3, when suddenly all that progress I made, all those parts I collected, and all those parts' abilities were suddenly and completely thrown out the window, and I was dropped in the middle of an RTS.Personally, I despise most RTS games. That's just me. Many people love them, and I don't knock them for loving them, but I hate the vast majority of the ones I've tried. I think Warcraft 2 was probably the one exception. Anyway, digressing a bit. The fun of the game just came to a screeching halt at that point for me, and the game became too annoying to continue.So if there's a specific genre of game you really can't stand, know that this one takes the form of many different ones. Do your homework and make sure no parts of the game are guaranteed to make you cringe before shelling out the cash for this. If this isn't an issue for you, then it's pretty well put together and can be a lot of fun.			"

												Screw this. I can't log into the EA Spore servers, and all that it says on EA help is that anyone who created an Origin account after 2013 can't log into the server and they are working on the issue. I would definitely ask for my money back if I thought that I could get it because half of the features of this game are playing online with other people. That is why the game askes you to log in online as soon as it launches. Steam or EA should put a large banner or something warning players about this issue with the EA servers. Other users have posted this issue on the EA forums with no response from EA.  This game was not worth the 20 dollars, and is practically only 50% of the game that the developers truly intended to release without online access. I have heard of other people having issue with EA, but I have not had any problems with them until now. I will definitely be cautious in the future if I ever purchase something that they release.

												To anyone over the age of 13, I would NOT recommend this game. I palyed this game when I was around 11 upon its release, and enjoyed it immensely. Evolution intrigued me, as did aliens. Moreover, the community was vibrant, and offered a whole host of unique, interesting other creations. That community is now dead. the majority of accounts and their creations have gone offline, in particular the better creators.Nonetheless, rather than bemoan how much of a blow this game took from EA rushing it out of development, I will say this: the game, even with its many shallow mechanics, will entertain a younger player for a good while. I could see just about anyone getting a solid 50+ hours, maybe over a hundred if they are particularly into the idea of creating creatures. TL;DR: This would be a good purchase for a <13 year old, cannot recommend it to anyone over that age.			"

												Interesting in its own right, spore is a rpg-ish action game based around the growth of a cingle celled organism to an advanced species. While the gameplay is fun if not somewhat repettative, it feels as if the developer of this game had bigger ideas for the game play at the later stages of the spore but instead opted to finish early and collect as much money as possible based on the early gameplay. I like the first 1/4 of the game. The latter falls short. I would pay 2.50 USD for this game only for the early gameplay.. The later gameplay is a waste of time. 3/10			"

												I bought the whole package and I really wonder why I did that. Here are some sporadic comments to the game: The game seems unfinished. Various options seems to be possible, but are not. There are bugs in the user interface. The gameplay is tedious. The creation of your animal is funny at first, but you have no real knowledge of how effective your choices are. The modern times to the game seems like another game entirely. I could write a lot more, but all in all, it is as if you are playing a game blindfolded. As the games stands now, it should be free.

												Not much to say about this one to be honest..It's kind of fun and cute to start with, and it makes a lot of promises in terms of making choices that matter - However, once the intro sequence is over and you enter the actual game, everything kind of falls flat and the entire experience gets rather stale. In an extremely repetitive fashion you go from place to place and either fight or make peace, all while finding various upgrades, changing your species and evolving, but a tthe end of the day it's just like adding pieces onto a static clay figure: It never really seems to matter much. Other than finding weird-looking things every now and again there's not much to do, or any real motivation to keep playing the game at all.I can't really recommend it because it feels more like a waste of time than a game. I don't feel immersed while playing it, and I don't feel connected to my 'character' or anything like that. It sort of feels a bit like one of those early 2000 online flash games, just flashier (pun intended) and trying to cover for it's complete lack of soul and substance behind a wall of 'It's all your choice maaan!'.

												Did Spore and No Man's Sky get switched in some temporal anomaly? Both have their flaws, but out of the two I'd sooner guess this one to have been released in 2016 than No Man's Sky. Sure, this game was over-hyped and doesn't exactly deliver thousands upon thousands of hours of gameplay, but it's still fun. Fun enough to warrant the price-tag, in my opinion!			"

												Very buggy, Very hard sometimes even on normal. But yet so very fun and replayable. Once you get the galactic adventures DLC the game never ends even if you completed the Space Age you can do quickplay and do random missions in quickplay mode with a captain you can create instantly! My favorite stages are Cell (Basically the minigame starting stage), Creature (After this stage you can't edit your creature anymore), and Space (Random missions made my actual people that are not devs and also trying to take over the whole galaxy is very fun.) Though this game is limited by one galaxy and it starts getting repetitive at times. The tribal stage is basically spores version of an RTS early on. Civilization stage is the same as tribal but longer, still fun by a bit but also they could have done more. Well now my I am done. Choose if you want to or not buy the game. I am not yo mum.			"

												Spore is a great game. Its got nearly endless replayability, Its bursting with charm, and It allows the player to be creative. The main game is admittedly shallow in its overall gameplay, but the feeling of having a species, based on your own design, evolve from a unicellular organism from a space-faring empire is indescribable. Its truely a shame that EA/Maxis have abandoned this game.			"

												very good with alot of player made content randomly adding itself to your game, you could be walking along then suddenly some horrible monster some guy made will be trying to kill you whilst someone elses creation comes along to aid you to kill it, the games play style changes as you go from a 2d game involving collecting food to get bigger and survive other things trying to eat you to then going on to be a friend or foe kind of game where you have to walk around collecting food and parts to build yourself by either befriending or destroying an entire species, then for the next two stages its a rts kind of thing then it goes onto a space stage which ive never really got the hang of, i recommend the space explorer dlc (i think that was the name?) which allows you to go down onto planets and fight in some kind of tps style of play			"

												This game shows promise, but it ultimately fails by way of trying to be a jack of all trades. Each stage of life features a different style of gameplay, and frankly, it's only entertaining during the first few phases when you can evolve your species' DNA. It is at this point which Spore offers something fun and unique.But after enough evolution, your species' body style becomes fixed and then the game turns into a RTS-type game, and then a Civ-like builder, progressing finally into an Endless Space-style universe explorer (and yes, I'm aware that ES was published after Spore... I'm just making a comparison). At this point the game becomes a tedious mess of empire management and stops being innovative and interesting.If Spore was able to increase game complexity while maintaining a focus on evolution, it would be much more interesting as well as entertaining. As it is, it feels like three (or more, depending on how you count) games crammed into a single package.			"

												Ah, Spore. I've played this when it first came out with its crippling DRM, and limited installs. This current version on steam works a lot better and is a lot easier to just jump right into when you want a game. And that's a big deal. Being able to just fire it up and start making creatures adds so much to the overall experience, while being stuck in DRM hell really puts you off before you've begun. The basic idea was always flawed. As has been said, by trying to go from a bacteria to taking over the galaxy, you just can't cover everything. You end up with 5 minigames rather than one full one. That said, there's something enduring and fun about this that makes it worth a purchase. It's still entertaining to swim your bacteria around, or devour your enemies. I've long since made it to the center of the galaxy (as close as the game has to an end goal) and I still want to come back to this game. If only they'd been more willing to relinquish control from the start and open this game up to modders, they could have added the content this game sorely needed, like fleshing out each section. Still fun, but oh, it could have been so much more. It could have been great.			"

												I have heard about this game when it released and knew that the Maxis studio had done quite the job getting pretty good reviews.This studio has always been sort of a Disney-like software developer for me thinking of the style they use in the various SIM-games. Somehow that withheld me from playing it at the time, i guess i was more into the more advanced and mature kind of gaming at the time.Now that the game is really cheap i decided to give it a go, remembering the hype back in the days.I must say that i am really impressed and i think i still have lots to see and discover.The great thing is that you can see this game was a real innovator combining different kinds of gaming genres almost seamless into eachother. ofcourse this brings in the danger of favoriting certain parts of the game to some, but still.I found my self playing this game well into the morning from the first go proving the game engages players from the start...which is impressive for a game that may well be called an oldy anno 2015.Except for the parts where i found my progress to go too fast and me wanting to stay in the current gamephase instead of progressing ( which can be postponed so i guess it's not that big a deal :) ) i find this game is near perfection and a very good choice when you are looking for a varied and i must say..relaxing game.originality, content, replayability, humour, freedom of choice and a gamepath that certainly can't be called too short and even achievements ( which must have been one of the first games having those i guess )...this game has all these things.Be careful when you try this one....you might find yourself regretting not playing this game earlier like me ;)			"

												Spore is an interesting evolution simulator, one of the best Maxis games out there if I do say so myself, it is a very entertaining game to play, and evolving my creatures to look hilariously stupid, is something to be reckoned with.To read the full review, go to: hellstrand.comule.com/reviews/spore.html*WARNING There is some ads, just close them, they cause no harm*			"

												This Game caught my eye while I was browsing through the games on sale during the Halloween sale. I got it just after my birthday, Halloween, and loved every minute of it. I even bought the creepy and cute bundle so i can make wakey looking creatures :) almost done filling the galaxy. It is an Amazing Game!			"

												Spore is an interesting concept that suffers from lack of consistency throughout its gameplay and lack of replayability.The beginning of the game shows you all of the greatness of spore - creating your race, consuming other beings, and swimming around in a cesspool of creative and dangerous creatures. As soon as you evolve to the point of being able to go on land and interact with multicellular beings, the game's attraction begins to diminish. Now you're fighting with other races, using a mixture of ""evolved"" traits that can be changed at any time and generic attacks, and utilizing an overly simplistic mechanic to communicate and befriend them. Next  thing you know, you evolve far enough that you can create weapons and buildings and you're playing any other generic RTS. All the cool racial choices you've made thus far in order to survive become completely cosmetic and useless. The game itself doesn't take very long to progress from cell to this world dominator phase.I cannot recommend purchasing this game at full price, or even while it's on sale. If you've realling been pining for it, get it while it's on sale. But even so, there are many games that are more deserving of your time.			"
