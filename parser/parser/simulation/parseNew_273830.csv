												Some things I notice right away - The performance is terrible. My machine well meets the recommended requirements and I still get ~20 frames per second on medium settings. There's no traditional tutorial, at least not in the sense of reading instructions and then practicing, which is practical in a flight sim. It's easy enough to keep the plane flying straight if you have a flight stick, but for any casual player who's using mouse and keyboard, it'll be difficult to keep the plane from nose diving while reading instructions all at a horrible frame rate. Even the highest setting for graphics looks horrible. Enough said. I could rant more about this, and struggle to find redeeming characteristics, but I think I've hit the criteria which are necessary for a video game to be enjoyable. Please don't buy this.			"

												Aviator - Bush Pilot: so much promise, so little delivered, typical of UIE.to sum it up,'terrible, just terrible'the BAD:+ framerate is horrible, making smooth flight impossible - tried a number of configurations and none of them helped.+ dodgy GPS locator in flightthe GOOD:+ actually looks OK IMHO+ if the framerate was not so bad, the controls would be just fine+ Actually has radio channels and the ability to stream your own musicI wish they had optimised the game before giving us streaming music..!It's a shame as the framerate ruins the game totally.-10/10AVOID (get for the cards only ..maybe..)

												DO NOT BUY!I was so happy to be able to buy a new game. Especially one involving planes and building your own business, But alas I cannot even play this game, i am constantly circiling to the left, i have unplugged all my controllers to no avail. It has made this game un-playable.  i am seriously dissapointed, there is absolutly NO modification ability to controls whatso ever. there is no help on the forums, the is no help from any one. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. it is absolute crap. if the devs decide to update this game, then i will review my review. but atm. this is absolutly un-playable. i want my money back!PROS - cant tell you as i cant play the gameCONS - yes i was conned. conned out of £7 for such a poor quality game.  - No controller support - No ability to customise your own controllsSeriously do yourself a favor. steer clear of this game. If you want a game that offers a simular profile of building your own airline, go for air hauler. (for FSX) or Cargo Pilot (for FSX) Until this game is seriously modified by the dev team, i have no interest in changing my review.			"

												This could be a great little casual game if it was actually finished. It is not a true flight sim and to prove it, there is no support for customising controls and if you are lucky enough to have a flight controller, you will find the throttle is useless. I could not even find a button to accelerate at all, so ended up using a gamepad. Controlling the planes is not that bad at first though they always seems to be turning left a little . The starting plane seems to lack lift and is constantly falliing. Its not really an issue until you try to bank sharply, and find yourself falling too fast to do anything. The second plane on the other hand is always climbing. Again not to bad except for the fact it is extremely slow and climbing slows it further. It struggles to get enough power to climb when taking off, which is bad considering the number of runways surrounded by hills. the constant climbing also prevents it building enough speed to finish many of the timed missions. The third plane is the worst so far. The rate of climb is so severe it makes landing difficult. the amount of force you need to counter it is also likely to give some side input. the problem there is that this plane is also very responsive making it incredibly hard to fly straight. This means that landing are ridiculously hard, trying to counter the uplift and land straight so as not to run into something or roll. I have yet to unlock the fourth plane, but already dreading it. One thing they all have in common, is a useless rudder. Pressing it will turn you only a few degrees, no matter how long you hold it. When you release it you will  have to endure some wild swaying back and forth until it settles close to the direction you started.The graphic of the game are pretty basic but FPS sux, badly. With the game only using maybe 20% of my CPUs capacity, and GPU barely registing any use, I can only get an average of 11fps even on lowest settings and smaller resolution. Higher detail was barely worth the 4fps I ws getting. The only major differnce was on lower settings I could actually see things through the clouds at 300metres, that completely block visibilty on high detail. For those not familiar with the metric system, that is damn low, under the minimum legal flight altidude in many countries. So having no visiblitly of anything on the ground makes it damn hard to land. Night time, which is somehow 14hrs long,  has a similar problem. In this case though it is more from lack of design. Fair enough you cant expect lights in the middle of nowhere, but some runways have drum barrels that remain unlit, and base runways have power and still no lights. Not even the buildings have lights.The games missions are something I really like. There is a good variety and you are given a choice of three at a time. Even here though there are some issues. The worst being some timed missions are too short for the capabilities of the second plane. Another annoying set are ones requiring you to go though a series of waypoints to your destination. Thats fine if you are taking tourist sight seeing, but why do I have to fly in a needless zigzig when someone needs something urgently. Even worse, why do I have to fly the whole zigzag on the return trip? To make it worse quite a few waypoints are hidden behind mountain. Isnt the idea to set way points to avoid obsticles? Also they are white and set at 300m. The exact altidude to be hidden by clouds, which seem to always be around. A lesser complaint would be the fire fighting missions. You fly through a series of waypoints and drop something on the fire when prompted. Exactly what you drop and how you can drop it multiple times is something left up the imagination it seems.I did enoy playing this game at first, but the bad hadling mixed with pathetic fps made it more of a chore flying the third plane. Add in the terrible night landings and hidden/useless waypoints and I honestly cannot recommend the game in its current state.			"

												impulse bought this game, the moment i saw it because bush planes are rad as hell. that was a bad course of action.the controls...  they're so sluggish.  and badly explained, to boot.  the graphics are PS2 level  at the very best. i feel i'm being generous, with that one.i realize i'm barely into this game, at this point.  30 min, in fact. but my will to continue is almost entirely gone, already.let me put it this way. i fiddle around in second life, a fair bit.  and the aircraft in SL are far more enjoyable and realistic to fly. and that's saying a lot.

												I really wish I had read mroe into this game before buying it. I like planes so I saw planes and though ooh this will be fun! It's not. The controls are horible, I mean BEYOND horrible, it's oversensative and really laggy - is that even possible?! I couldn't find a way to change the controls, I wouldn't even play this with a gaming pad.			"

												So much hope that this game wouldn't be complete crap...But it is..Very low frames, lots of stuttering. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as FSX or Microsoft Flight... But its unplayable. ""well this guy has a crappy rig thats all. Surely""  FX-8350 R9 290x  Still get 25 fpsNot to mention there hasnt been a peep out of the devs since its release.Don't waste your money. Go buy an expansion for Microsoft Flight			"

												Absolute junk. The controls can't be modified, and the throttle slider on my thrustmaster controls the rudder for some reason. The tisk works fine for HAWX and Jane's strike fighters, but not for this game. The graphics are horrible and the response is laggy on my computer with an i5 CPU and GeForce GTS 450, with low quality graphics. And oh yes, the keyboard controls are useless as well. Overall a very bad purchase for me. I would suggest other people to steer clear of this, even if it is offered for free.			"

												Take-off fail. No, not the plane of the game, the game itself. Also I looked for troubleshoots and navigated through the publisher and the game designers web-pages (a bit amateurish designed websites, gotta say), but found nothing. Eventually I figured out a solution (playing it on a different PC) and that did the trick, but hey..no, I did not like it. It lacks a lot. I would honestly not recommend buying. Sorry to those who liked it.			"

A Screenshot of Aviator - Bush Pilot
By: Charley Tank




Okay so I took this Screenshot 10-02-16 on high settings with an i7 6700k 16GB of DDR4 Ram and an Xtreme Gaming GTX 980 Ti 6 GB video card and only what 54 FPS I don't know what I was thinking when I wrote this review on this game before, I did recommend it and after playing it on this system and only getting 54 FPS I had to change my entire thought process. the controls alone are kinda bad okay they are bad it's not the normal keyboard controls it's weird I couldn't control it what so ever. so I hooked up an Xbox 360 controller and it got a little better maybe 12% but this game is pretty unplayable on my i5 4690K 32GB of Ram with an Xtreme Gaming GTX 970 and I can play the crap out of a lot of games with this PC but on this game it's pushing 16 FPS on High 22 on low. I would not Recommend this game unless you have a super computer and like crappy controls.			"

												I probably got this game from a bundle somewhere. I decided I should at least give it a shot, and the first mission or so seemed moderately playable (not good, but at least playable) as long as I didn't have to turn. I got about halfway through the second mission (the missions have lengths in the vicinity of 50 km when you're flying at 250 km/hr, so it sounds like you can expect 12 minutes of tedious and terrible flying for one chance to do anything else), dropped some antidote off at a drop point (luckily I didn't have to land), and was contemplating actually giving this game a bit more of a shot. Then my plane promptly decided to nosedive into a hill.I don't think there's any redeeming factor here.			"
