												Rescue Team is a fun little Time Management game developed by the same folk who gave us the Treasures of Montezuma series.  The premise is simple, disaster has struck three small islands and you must send workers to rescue stranded residents and repair the damage.  Sounds good to me.Time management games generally aren't my forte, but this little gem is a lot more fun and engaging than I was expecting.  Gameplay consists of completing various objectives (rescue residents, rebuild homes, etc.) before time runs out.  You're only given so much time and resources to complete each level and earning a gold trophy often takes you right up to the wire. Despite the casual tag, earning gold is anything but casual and will require pushing your multi-tasking skills to the limit.  At times you'll be pulling out your hair, trying over and over again with different strategies to eek out those precious few seconds.  But once you FINALLY squeak in on time, that feeling of accomplishment will fuel you to continue on to the next level.  Addictive gameplay is an understatement.  Sitting down for 10 minutes to complete a level or two just doesn't happen.  That drive for perfection will often have you tied to your seat twice as long as you were planning, but I regret nothing!There's quite a bit of strategy involved here.  Determining the order to rebuild to increase output of cash and materials while also managing buffs to get the most out of speed boosts requires careful planning and timing.  Any lulls in action often means failure, so moving as quickly and efficiently as possible while keeping all workers busy at all times is a must.  Once you get the hang of things, though, it's just a matter of execution.With 60 progressively harder levels, there's plenty to keep you busy.  Each completed stage earns you cash to rebuild your destroyed home.  It's a small touch that adds something extra to the game, although I think the gameplay stands up just fine without it.My only gripe is the lack of Steam Achievements which I find a little boggling as they add quite a bit of value to games like these.  And there are indeed in-game achievements to be earned (and reward bonus money), however the achievement gallery is currently broken and links to the House Restoration screen instead.  Once that is fixed and perhaps Steam Achievements added, there's not much I can complain about here.All said, Rescue Team is a lot more enjoyable than I was expecting, especially for the price.  If you're a fan of the genre, you'll definitely want to check this one out especially if you're looking for a bit of challenge.  I see myself going for Gold on all 60 levels, and with achievement fixes (and added Steam integration please), will find myself back in the midst of multi-tasking craziness for hours to come!Bottom Line: 7/10 (8 with achievement fixes)Note - This game was provided by the publisher with the request to write an informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received. "

												Rescue Team is a casual time and resource management game(RTS lite) by Buka Entertainment. A storm has ravaged Greenfield Island and has left the island(and your property) greatly damaged. Your goal is to earn enough money to fully restore your ravaged property. To earn money you must restore Greenfield island section by section by controlling  a team of workers and pilots . Completing each island section (or level) in the least amount of time can earn you cash bonuses(and gold or bronze trophies).Tough decisions are the hallmark of good strategy games and Rescue Team has plenty of those - Do you restore lumber mills(wood) or delis(food) first to generate resources ? or do you rescue workers to increase  your manpower ? how soon do you restore the helipad to get the helicopter and begin rescuing people ? should you restore the bridge to gain access to more areas or do you remove debris to gain resources and clear more road ? Clever level design compliments the sound strategy to create a satisfying experience. It took me about 10 hours to complete the game with gold trophies for every level - but I am no RTS genius - so there is probably 7-8 hours of gameplay for the RTS inclined - more if you take it casual or are a novice to the genre. The game has decent graphics and a competent soundtrack but does lack option to adjust the resolution.If you want a good casual RTS with solid gameplay and intelligent level at an affordable price then Rescue Team may be the game for you - easy to recommend (this game would be worth twice the price if it included a level editor)			"

												Rescue Team is a cool little time management game in which you are tasked with cleaning up after a disaster on a tropical island. During each level, you are given a certain number of workers -- plus the potential of freeing others by removing debris. Your workers will then rebuild the town by repairing structures, collecting resources, rescuing villagers, and putting out fires. As you progress through the levels, you earn money that can be used to repair your personal villa, which has also sustained damage during the disaster.Completing each level awards cash and statues in three ranks, with bonuses given for completing the levels faster. Achieving gold statues on each is a challenge, but just playing through the missions is pretty easy -- making Rescue Team appropriate for young kids or anyone who enjoys relaxing with casual game time that doesn't require a lot of brainpower. In each level, you have to determine in what order to perform each of several tasks so that you can keep your workers busy and complete all the tasks as quickly as possible. It's much more addictive than it sounds, and a lot of fun. It's quite a few hours of gameplay for a really low price, and the replayability comes in trying to beat the levels fast enough to achieve gold times.Rescue Team is really similar to another game from the same developers called Ballad of Solar. In fact, it's pretty much the same game, except with a tropical disaster setting instead of heroes and wizards and other fantasy elements. So, if you enjoyed that one, you will probably love Rescue Team (and vice versa).I do wish that the game included Steam Achievements (it does have trading cards though), but the in-game achievements available do at least add an additional level of play for goal-oriented gamers.  Graphics settings are limited to full screen and windowed mode, and playing fullscreen at widescreen resolutions will add a background rather than expand the play area. However, as someone who tends to prefer casual gaming in a window, I didn't find it to be an issue.			"

												Rescue Team is a time and resource management game published by Buka Entertainment.In Rescue Team, players rebuild three islands that have been hit by a terrible storm by repairing houses and facilities, removing debris, and performing other helpful tasks.Rescue Team features 60 levels scattered over three different islands. The game features one mode in which you can finish levels with gold, silver, or bronze scores depending on your time.Each level consists of a few goals and presents slightly varying maps to the player. The goals varies from saving villagers by boat or helicopter to collecting gems or repairing certain structures.All these goals can be supported or fulfilled by your staff.For nearly every action that you let your workers perform a resource is needed, but in most cases you will also get a different resource in return. Those include gold, wood, and food.Most of the times you have to remove debris from the streets, rebuild structures or free workers who are trapped behind large rocks by collecting and using dynamite. Villagers can be saved by constructing the helipad or the boathouse and clicking them, which will also cost a good chunk of your gold reserves. Fires can be extinguished in a similar manner.Compared to other titles in this genre, Rescue Team feels pretty light when it comes to presentation and diversity. The maps have a rather unique look but are not very detailed. The goals lack variation aswell – pretty quickly you will feel like doing the same over and over again.Not being able to upgrade buildings or hire new workers also restricts complexity.However there's quite a bit of strategy involved here. Determining the order to rebuild to increase output of cash and materials while also managing buffs to get the most out of speed boosts requires careful planning and timing. The variety of goals, features and level design is very restricted and the lack of steam achievements does some damage to the overall impression of the game. Still, Rescue Team is a solid time management game, even thought it doesn't bring anything new or revolutionary to the genre.			"

												This has been described as a time management game and it is, but it's a little more.Cons firstThe background music is very anoying. You won't miss it though if you turn it off.The art style isn't bad, it's just very kid style. So if that bothers you..I think it's a phone port.Pros nowThe game style is your typical, fix these problems by this time and get this level medal. But you'll find yourself enjoying the task of rebuilding the island town, putting out fires, and saving stranded villagers. You'll be itching to get better times. Better times mean more money to fix up your damaged vacation house. And that a nice element in the game, fixing a swank vaction home for yourself.Most important, it's fun.It's overall a easy to play if you have a few mins construction game. But you'll have to be careful cause it sucks you in and encourages you to spend way too much time at it.			"

												Rescue Team is time management game. It has little different control solutions, like you can't queue the orders and couple of small similar details. Generally it brings nothing new to the genre, but if you like such games, you won't be disappointed. It's not the best time management game I've ever played but it is solid piece of code. Everything works fine and it's not so easy to beat all levels with shorter time limit. Generally very nice game for such low price.What is definitely missing is achievements.VERDICT:If you like management game, this one won't disappoint you, but also won't surprise you.If you don't know the genre and want to try it, I would recommend something better.If you're a difficult and complex games maniac, you should looking for something else, except you're in a mood to play something simple.Like this review?

												Rescue Team:~~~~~~~~~~~Rescue Team is a  strategy / simulation game. After devastating weather hits Greenfield Island with full force and is well reported on the news, you are sent to the Island to be part of the rescue effort.At the start of the game, you will see a map with 3 islands. You will have to achieve all goals per level as fast as you can. Goals can vary from building houses, repairing restaurants, rescuing people (with a boat or helicopter) and getting gems. On some levels you will start with only one worker but do not worry too much because you will be able to add more workers to your team by removing obstacles like trees, rocks or repairing bridges that block their path. It becomes quite challenging when you have several workers to manage.You will need logs of wood, money and food to be able to remove obstacles or repair buildings and bridges. If you manage to beat the clock, you will be rewarded with a golden trophy which is worth $10,000. You also have silver and bronze rewards but the money reward is very minimal. Why is it important to get the golden reward, you might ask? Well, you have a mini game in which you repair your own house, and it costs a fair few pesetas to rebuild it. This game reminds me a little of the first Settler game; just the way it looks.The graphics are decent.If you like playing against the clock and figuring out which way is best to achieve a golden trophy and have fun, then give this a game a go!Positives:~~~~~~~~  -	Fast and Challenging (to beat the clock)-	Lots of levels-	Game runs well-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~ -	No achievementsFun game to own!8 /10Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

												***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Rescue Team is a casual time management game that just released on Steam. You are in charge of rescue workers (the number of them varies with each mission) and you must use them to help rebuild the city of Greenfield, spread across three islands, which was damaged following severe weather. You earn money for completing missions which can then be used to repair your own home in Greenfield and return it to its former glory. I've never really been a fan of time management games or any games involving a time limit but I was pleasantly surprised by this title.+Nice, simple graphics that suit the game well+Lots of missions+Nice variation between missions and there are a number of different possible objectives+The game is challenging if you are aiming for gold but pretty easy if you're just looking for a pass so it suits casual players as well as those who want a challenge+Simple but addictive gameplay, it's effectively a point and click+Good tutorial+The house building mini-game is a nice little extra+Has Steam trading cards-No resolution options and it doesn't have a 16:9 resolution as you can see from the borders in the screenshot

												Rescue Team is a casual time management game where the premise is you're overseeing a group of workers coming in to rebuild after a natural disaster. You play through 60 levels where you manage a crew appointing them to do various tasks within a short time frame, about 3-5 minutes.There are two awards you can get for finishing a level. The silver is for finishing around 5 minutes and is quite easy to get while the gold you get for finishing around 3 minutes and is often trickier. If you want to play low stress you can easily do that just aiming for the silver medals and playing through the game. Getting the gold is completely optional and is a bit hectic but there's also more strategy involve since you will often need to figure out the best order to complete tasks in so that you can complete the level in a shorter time frame.Personally I found that I often got silver on the first try, then once I got to know the level I'd go back and play for gold.Visually the game looks quite nice. The 2D graphics are done well and everything is crisp and clear with no blur or pixelation like you may see on some older or low res casual games.Another aspect of the game is you get a wrecked house to refurbish and slowly do that over time by earning money through completing missions. This gives you a sort of progress meter for how you're coming along in the game though I did wish a bit for more to that feature such as managing a rebuilt town. Perhaps in a future game.I quite enjoyed Rescue Team and found it to be a well made game for the casual genre that has a nice balance between relaxing and some strategy. It can perhaps get a bit repetitive at times however it's a game that can easily be played in short bursts and come back to later so helps mitigate that. I did like that I could pick it up, play a few rounds and then just come back to it later.For anyone who's a fan of casual games and light strategy I'd recommend Rescue Team as a fun, relaxing change of pace.

												The Rescue Team games are among the best ‘casual strategy’ games. Don’t be fooled by my almost none play time as I played them previously outside of Steam. There has been a chain of disasters and you manage a team of rescuers (Duh!). There’s a ton of levels to play and a variety of actions to do like building houses, rescuing locals, putting out fires, exploding stuff, repairing buildings etc. Each game has 60 levels spread out in three parts. Each part has a different theme and setup, like having a port and a rescue boat, rain and thunder, different background etc.  The graphics are cute, sound is okay and music is non-intrusive. All the levels have a tiny map and are short, around five minutes each. They do seem extremely simple at first but getting all the gold ratings is challenging and will take you some time. I highly recommend them!			"

												The first in a series of time and resource management games, Rescue Team 1 lacks a little functionality compared to the sequels, the biggest one being that you can't queue jobs. Each job requires one worker (on rare occasions, more than one) and the worker needs to be in base before they can be assigned. This leads to button mashing to assign the worker as soon as they return, and when you have multiple jobs and multiple workers, the click fest makes the game a little more frantic than later entries in the series.That said, having recently beaten Rescue Team 5, it was nice to go back to the original title and see how the games have progressed.Despite showing it's age a little, the graphics, sound, and level design in Rescue Team 1 are all still strong. The game still held my attention long enough to gold all levels, and even though the later games are more polished, if you are a fan of the genre, it's still worth checking out.			"

												This game was really fun! It's  all about multitasking and time management. You basicallly have a list of challanges to complete in x amount of time, which is about 3-5 min for each level. In those short minutes you will be click, click, clicking, furiously trying to figure out the correct order of tasks to assign your workers to get the most out of those precious seconds. Will you chooce to collect resources first? Which resource is most valuble right now,  wood or food? Oh shoot, I can't repair that bridge until I open the wood shop on the other side of the map first. The game has about 40 levels, but if you are a perfectionist like me, you might replay the same level a few times until you get gold ranking. It's very addictive and fun. it took me about 12+ hours to complete the entire game and get max ranking on all levels. For the cost of the game and the hours of intertainment it provided, I can highly  recommend. I'm 32 and the game looks like it's designed for kids, but that didn't really bother me. I would gladly pay more for an adult version of this game with tougher challenges and more levels.  7/10 :3			"

												If you are looking for a challenging time management game, this is a great one for you. It's older - the graphics, achievements, and celebratory ending leave much to be desired. Also YOU CANNOT QUEUE UP TASKS. You have to wait until a worker returns to the home base before you can assign him elsewhere.But the levels are HARD to meet gold time. I found myself replaying levels over and over again because unless you do it perfectly, you don't get gold. I appreciated that after playing several other very similar games where winning was super easy. So if you want a challenge - go for it! But know this is an older game without many features you might be used to if you play these games often.			"

												An absolute joy of a game! It just makes you feel good after each level when the village/city folks come out of their houses and businesses to thank you with a friendly wave after you have fixed up their part of the city. The city has been damaged greatly by a tornado and it is your job to clean and fix it all up. This game is fluid, extremely addictive and really hard to put down.  The graphics are fun and give you a happy feeling. This is a great casual game for hardcore gamers that want to get Gold on every level and for those people that just want to burn a lot of time playing each level. The end goal is to fix up your own house with all the earnings that you have acquired with fixing up the city. Overall this game is excellent and a must play for anyone that wants to have a casual game that is fun to play and easy to understand.  "

Note - This game was provided by the publisher/developer with the request to write an unbiased, informative review. No other consideration, compensation or instruction was received.I'm having a hard time classifying Rescue Team into a single genre. It's got city builder elements, with its resource management and buildings. It's got puzzle elements, with you figuring out how to clear the island in the proper path, and it's a whole lot of casual. But that's okay, as it's a whole lot of fun! I did not expect this game to be much, but it genuinely surprised me.Rescue Team has the player tasked with clearing a series of stages set on an island that's been ravaged by natural disasters such as fires and hurricanes. It doesn't really show these disasters, but it does show the damage that's been caused! It's yoru job to clean things up and get everythign back in working order. To do so, you take command of a set of workers who can be ordered around each stage. Starting from the ""Base"", you can click on a pile of debris or a resource and your worker will rush out, do what he's been ordered, then run back once finished. For example, each level is littered with piles of woods, branches, etc. Click on one and a worker will rush out to clear the pile. While working on the task, a bar will appear over his head to indicate his progress. Once the bar fills up, his task is complete and he will run back to base with any gathered materials. It's very simple gameplay, but it quickly becomes more challenging. Before you start each stage it gives you time to lok over things and plan out your first few moves. Once you click something, the timer starts. Worry not, the timer only influences your final rating on the stage.As you progress, you will gain access to some buildings that generate resources for you, at a rate of 10 per tick (tick = a minute or so, sometimes it seemed faster than that). Sometimes the buildings will drop an extra pile of resources next to them for you to have your workers grab. There are 3 resources: Food, Wood, and Gold. Food supplies your workers with nourishment, and is also part of the cost of some actions. Wood is the resource needed for most repairs, such as fixing bridges and buildings. Last, Gold is used as a cost for some actions, much like food. For example, fixing a bridge costs 50 food and 50 wood. Sometimes a stock of resources is stashed behind obstacles, such as a pile of rubble or beyond a broken highway. Accumulating the required amount to get past the obstacles is sometimes a puzzle in itself, as you need to manage your resources properly (especially if you do not have the buildings that generate them for you), as you can hit a dead end, requiring you to restart the stage via the menu. Cleared stages get you money in your bank account. Money in your bank account is used to fix your own house, piece by piece. This will take you quite some time, so don't expect it to be done in a short period!The graphics are simple, as well as the animations, but they are full of charm. Rescue Team is a very cute game. Everything is very well defined and crisp. I did not notice any graphically glitches (or any glitches for that matter) during my time playing. The music is also simple, but it's very catchy. As for length, the game appears to be pretty long. You have an ""overworld"" type of screen, spanning a few islands, and each level is represented by a safety cone. As you clear each stage, the cone is replaced with a colored statue representing your score (bronze, silver, gold).

												Rescue Team is a casual action puzzle game with a time attack element.  Your home gets wrecked by an unfortunate extreme weather event and it will cost a fortune to restore your domicile to it's former glorious stature.  You are required to assist with rescue and repair missions across the islands in order to generate income to pay the repair bills on your home.  Along the way you will rescue workers to assist you.  Rebuild hotdog stands, gold mines, sawmills and municipal landmarks.  There are helicopter missions to rescue stranded villagers, and to douse raging fires.  You will rebuild bridges, repair roads and remove rubble.  You also get to collect resources generated by buildings you have repaired.  Last but not least you get to find and recover shiny sparkling gems.The art style is cartoon like and has a cute factor.  The game plays perfectly at full HD 1080p resolutions.The music is cheerfull and bouncy calypso/reggae chip sound midi which is a nostalgia trip to the good old Atari ST and Commodore Amiga days.  The tunes are catchy and pleasant easy listening.  In game sounds are not too disimilar to the modern gambling casino machines :)Gameplay is fun and simple and gradually eases the player into more complex puzzle scenarios.  Players can reselect any previously completed stage should they feel they could improve on their score or time performance.  For some strange reason completing all the objectives except one and ignoring the time restraint, the player can leave the game running passively in the background to generate additional resource income and boost score for a round.This game will appeal to young children and to adults who enjoy casual games.  There is no violence and so the game is extremely family friendly.  This game and ""The Promised Land"" would both be great first additions to a young players game library.Rescue Team will provide many hours of stress free casual gaming and leave the player feeling relaxed and happy.  The game is extremely well thought out and appears to be bug free (unlike some disappointing AAA titles).The biggest benefit of this game is the diminutive file size (under 40Mb) which is small even compared to patches or updates of other games.  So if you are one of the corporate laptop casual gamers pressed for space this is the game for you!This game is less complex and less demanding than ""The Promised Land"" but is fun to play.Rescue Team automatically tracks progress of each player name registered and so there is no need for a Game Save feature.  This is a great benefit as a player can easily resume from where they were the next time they open the game without having to remember to save.Rescue Team is a great casual time-waster and at the price is good value for money (especially if it is on discount).7 / 10			"

												I would recommend this game if you can get it on sale.  It is too short to pay full price.   You only get 60 levels.  I beat it in around 7 hours and I wasn't in a hurry either.  I got this on sale. So, I am satisfied.			"

Rescue Team is Addictive!It's a fast paced point & click, yet you restore certain buildings to gain certain resources allowing you to restore other buildings and so on.GameplayStarting out in gameplay, there's a chance at the beginning of every level where you can assess the situation and evaluate what/where to start first (before the clock starts ticking), in the earlier levels it is quite obvious where to start, but later on you start seeing options. Weather it'd be rescuing more workers or collecting resources or just to focus on fulfilling the level's goals. By the time the level is in full swing you be wishing you had more workers to beat the time margin to win the gold medal. After every level you'll get a score based on how well you did, measured through 3 things:1. Time (how efficent you were)2. Resources (how many resources you collected)3. Buildings Restored (how many biuldings were restored for the duration of the level)These three things affect the outcome of your final score for the level which carries over to your bank. Once in your bank, these funds can be used to restore your own house on the island, --but dont get too excited; the player's house has already been chosen for us. And that's ok in my opnion. The game is after all about the rescue team. In a way the player's house represents how far you've come in the game. Take screenshot of it and that'll show 'em all how far you've gone.To Wrap It All UpPretty much gameplay is strait-foward, there's no beating around the bush or any indecisiveness when you first start playing at the beginning of the game. It tells it to you strait and you can jump right in. The whole concept of the game is very easy to grasp yet difficult to master. It teaches time management and what to target as higher priority. Rescue Team 1 is a solid start to (I hope) a good line of games. Reminds me a bit of Flight Control HD with alot more added stuff to do rather than just making things go from point A to B.Final Words(for all those TLDR people)Rescue Team 1 is a great game. Simple, yet satisfying as well. With an added simplicity that makes it look eligant and refined. Addicting, but it doesnt trap you. I found it quite enjoying I'm sure i'll be playing this for awhile.WEEGEE APPROVED "

												I purchased this game for a whopping $1.69 during the winter sale.  This game is by no means incredibly innovative and enthralling.  It's a simple puzzle game which can be a bit repetitive.  I believe I reached the 37th level before writing this review and at this point the game hasn't come out with anything new (just different paths).  One major disappointment to me  is that when you fully repair your house you don't get any kind of victory notice... or anything.  It just goes to 5 stars.  I at least want some balloons or confetti.  As far as graphics go, it is cute and clean.  I haven't had any issues with the game running or skipping.All that said, if you are the type of person who wants to achieve gold for every level before moving on this is well worth the $1.69 (or even a couple bucks more) as it is legimitately difficult to get it on some levels.

												If you like this kind of tme managment game, then this one is ok, however there are better out there. The Hercules series and the Viking Brothers are both superior. In short it lacks variety and is too easy.It plays well enough and looks ok, but there isn't enough variety of tasks. It also lacks any ability to queue tasks which makes the strategy a little simple. The puzzle element - deciding the order in which to do tasks - is mostly lacking. There is usually only one or two possible paths to take and I got gold time on at least half the levels on the first try and none made me sweat. The levels also don't get progressively harder after the first few.It's ok and if you like this kind of game then it is worth getting in a sale. Probably best suited for younger players who might find it challenging.			"
