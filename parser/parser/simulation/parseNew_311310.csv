								Naval Action brings back old memories of playing Sid Meier's Pirates, you get into the game by joining a server and creating a ""character"", you name yourself and choose your allegianceNationsGreat BritainSpainFranceDenmark-NorwayNetherlandsSwedenUnited StatesPiratesI was very happy to see the range of nations as it spices things up, I spent a good deal amount of time thinking who to fight for, in the end I chose Great Britain as I wanted to be ""classy"", a little note, I don't think there are nation specific ships, all nations can use the same ships, don't take my word for it though Presentation The game looks really good! You also have a fair variety of options so you can tweak your game if it doesn't run at its best, I personally am running at highest graphics without FXAA & AA and I am getting 60 FPS no problem ( i5 4670k & GTX 960 if you want to know )  Ships When you get into the game, you start with a ""Basic Cutter"", it is a very decent ship, and I would suggest sticking to it for a while, be sure to ""play around"" and see how you like to play since it will be important later on. In the store you will see 7 rates of ships, what this means is that the ships are divided into classes, as they were, with 1 being your heaviest ( Santisima & Victory ) and 7 being lightest ( Lynx, Cutter etc. ) Trading Trading, I don't yet know much about but it also plays a big role in the game, you transport cargo from one place to another, buying for less and selling for higher, there are specialised trading ships in the game which offer more space for the cargo, however, these ships usually make easy targets for pirates or other ships in general, so you should most likely do it with a friend! Combat The game is fairly realistic, so battles are generally very slow and take time, you basically have to outmanouver your opponent and turn his ship into swiss cheese! The sounds are also great so hearing bigger ships fire feels very rewarding and very immersive. For battle, you also have a nice variety of customization, you can buy cannons for your ship ( Watch out for what class of gun you're buying, you can get confused! ), and in battle you'll have three basic ammo types, ball, chain & grape. Oh and, you can board ships! Yes! Sadly, you can't see the actual fight, it's more of a turn game, where luck and tactics decide the outcome Things to mention The game is alpha, so there are bugsThe loading screens are very humorousThe game is very grindyDon't sail in big ships while low level! ( The way it works is the higher level you are, the bigger crew you can have, imagine sailing a Frigate with 40 men! ) There is a map, but you have to know how to navigate! ( You can't see your location on the map )I hope this review helped!  "

								I Loved this game, and the potential it HAD. Unfortunately due to what I'll be outlining below, I STRONGLY recommend avoiding this game.===GENERAL GAMEPLAY AND COMBAT===The combat, sounds and ships in battle are authentic and enjoyable. However with a lack of players it's extremely hard to find worthwhile fights against anyone or anything except AI ships, unless you're in one of the few large clans. This game has no place for the casual player, another thing the developers refuse to address.Outside of a clan your experience levelling will simply be that of sailing to a port, getting a mission, fighting an AI ship, rinse and repeat hundreds of times. This huge GRIND has meant the game lost alot of potential players, very little has been added or even mentioned to address this.===GRAPHICS===The game is visually stunning on occasion, every ship looks top-notch and the weather system can make for some absolutely beautiful scenes. However the game's graphics engine is poorly optimized, you'll run into performance issues during large battles on even the best of computers.The UI is extremely barebones and quite frankly very unappealing to look at, outlined changes to the appearance have been delayed with no ETA.====DEVELOPERS===The developers have ruined an absolute jewel in this niche genre. They are far too stubborn and childish to admit their faults and correct them despite negative feedback from the playerbase.Constructive criticism on the game's forums is NOT welcome.Before you buy this game, being that the game is still in early access, you really do need to know the true nature of this development team. These developers have purposefuly removed planned features and content out of spite due to negative patch feedback, for those who would say I'm lying, here's ONE example:Taken from the first admin post on this page:http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/15485-patch-993-bucentaure-acceleration-rework-and-many-other-things/page-8""We worked very hard this month and your comment offended my programmers and artists (makers of Bucentaure and Santa Cecilia).I changed my mind and trading xp will never get implemented until release because of your comments. I am not joking. We focus on making happy customers happier. Half empty pessimists are not our market""If you don't like or wish to voice your concerned opinion on certain features or are simply unhappy with certain aspects of the game, you are completely disregarded and not welcome, even though you paid for the game like everybody else. Those with constructive criticism are branded ""half empty pessimists"" or ""trolls"" and that's only if you choose to brave the vocal minorty of privileged ""testers"" who'll defend the developers to the ends of the earth on the forums.Another situation came about because the developers decided to add a feature called the ""pray button"" in their monthly ""content"" patch, players logged into the game, with no information in the patch notes as to what the pray button did, leading people to speculate on the forums, because people were speculating wrongly, the developers called these players trolls and called for them to be banned.""Please report players who are spreading the rumors.Mods are requested to ban players who consistently troll unsuspected players by lying or misinforming them about the features they know nothing about.  Captains who think they can troll devs  in patchnotes or other players in help chats have come to the wrong forum. We respect players and demand the same in return. Players who show no respect will be removed from here.""http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/15862-patch-994-alliances-new-ships-new-features/page-15Again, scroll down to the first admin post on the page.===FALSE STEAM REVIEWS - DEVELOPER BRIBERY===The developers have openly suggested more positive steam reviews will result in more content, attempting to bribe their playerbase and leading to a misrepresentation of the true opinions of this game, here are a few examples:""To celebrate the increase in the steam ratings 4 ships will be added to the game as event ships.""""If ratings continue to grow we will try hard to add more ships before release. We need your support to make the game better. Please go to Steam and rate the game if you have not done so. Thank you for all the generous support!""Active and former players are afraid to leave negative steam reviews, fearing that it might impact the development of the game for the worse.===""CONTENT""===If you, like me, see ""content"" as new things to see and do in the gameworld, this game is NOT for you. The development team see bugfixes and tweaks to meaningless aspects of the game as ""content"". You will be dissapointed month after month from the lack of new content in the ""monthly content patches""Another direct quote from the developers on the forums:""We are a small team so everything new we add is content. Fixes and new perks IS content. We are too old to adjust our views for someone who has a different idea on what content is. You are probably spoiled by some magical developer.""This game is due for full release on just a few months. There's barely been anything worthwhile added to the game in terms of content other than the small amount of new ships and fishing. When fishing was introduced, player numbers made a slight resurgance, recently with dissapointment after dissapointment with each coming patch, player numbers are plummeting again, the top and only relevant server eu pvp 1 is rapidly becoming an empty, barren, wasteland.Important promised features just didn't appear, pirates have been abandoned in terms of promised features, port battles are still floating towers, despite a promised overhaul MONTHS ago. NOTHING of true substance has been added in terms of content, these features now have ""no ETA"" as we head towards release.===PLAYERBASE===The playerbase is PLUMMETING, you need only check a website displaying steam stats to have this proven correct directly infront of your eyes, this is a direct result of everything I've mentioned above. This game once had servers full every night, nowadays if you're anywhere other than outside capitals or with a clan you'll struggle to find your fellow players, because there aren't many left.Despite this the small remaining community you will find are mostly very friendly.http://steamcharts.com/app/311310===MICROTRANSACTIONS===They are on their way in the form of ""premium ships"" special ships you can't get your hands on unless you buy them in addition to the already expensive game. As a game with a large pvp element, I don't need to tell you how detrimental this will be to the balance of the already unbalanced game. Special ships exclusive to ""testers"" and ""moderators"" are also under consideration.""Premium ships are not rumors and they were discussed extensively before.""http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/6451-are-premium-ships-rumors-real/page-1?hl=premium%20ships===SUMMARY===To summarise this game's ""open world"" is a large lobby in which you sail around, with a huge lack of content and players, the developers are unwilling to listen to criticism or admit to their mistakes. Naval Action is going down like the Titanic, avoid at all costs.AVOID.----------------------------------------------------------UPDATEAfter the developers of this game flagged my review as ""off topic"" and ""abusive"" they were reported to steam. Steam took a look at the evidence I provided them and read my review, they decided the review was NOT ""off topic"" or ""abusive"" and removed the flag and censorship put in place by the developers, thank-you to steam, and those of you with kind comments.

Early Access Review
								Short version:- Progress on the game is painfully slow, most updates add nothing new, but just adjust combat variables and even that is done seemingly carelessly.- It's a timesink, heavily discouraging casual play. However, dedicated players aren't really rewarded since the game lacks features in a bad way.- Combat system currently heavily favours attackers, leaving PvP servers as gank or be ganked.- The game is bleeding active players. The last two months has seen the game's biggest server go from a daily peak population of almost 2500 players to less than 1000, even with a smaller server being merged into the big one. This means little to no community for many factions, as the players are spread out over 7 different nations plus 1 pirate faction.Bit longer version:The game definitely has potential, and in the hands of a bigger company/more productive developers, I think this would turn out very well. Having spent hundreds of hours on the game over several months, I don't think that will happen, unfortunately.It's still very bare bones. There is little other to do than battle, and while the battle mechanics are quite fun, the game is open world  and generally set up in a way that makes it seem very dull and empty when battle is the only fleshed out part.On the face of it, that's not a problem, though. This is after all Early Access, so you don't expect a full game. I do expect progress, however, and in the 2 months I've played the game, the only new 'feature' to be introduced was the ability to enter ports belonging to other nations as a smuggler, and from what I can read on forums, that is in fact all they've managed to add in about half a year.The rest of their effort seems to be spent fiddling with damage, armour, penetration and other battle-related details, often messing things up immensely. A good example was a change to leaks that meant a light frigate could just ram a huge ship-of-the-line and that alone would sink the massive hulk in less than a minute.It's also a time sink like nothing else I've ever played. You need hours to do anything interesting, as just travelling to and from a mission will often take more than half an hour on its own, especially if the wind is against you. You spend so much time doing absolutely nothing, but even then you can't actually let the game idle, as the wind changes and you'll have to adjust your course or you have to look out for enemy ships.Speaking of enemy ships, combat very badly handled and I see no reason to expect the devs will change the current system. Combat occurs not in the Open World map, but in an instance, so to speak. The relevant players are removed from the Open World map and placed in a separate combat map. Other players not dragged in from the beginning can reinforce the battle, but only for a couple of minutes, then the combat is closed until it ends. This means jumping lone players with a group of ships will basically ensure an easy kill, since there simply isn't time for help to arrive. Ganking is the way to go in this game.I could go on, but I've already wasted enough time on this game, hoping it would live up to its potential. It doesn't now and I have no reason whatsoever to think it ever will.			"

								While the game is the only show in town if you want a realistic Age of Sail game I have sadly withdrawn my recommendation. After many, MANY hours of testing since the early days of closed testing, much of the potential never went anywhere. Good combat mechanics will only tide me over for so long. The rest of the game is nowhere near up to snuff.The PvP port battles are a repetitive time consuming chore and there is no meaningful PvE.Worst of all, the balance is out the window, allowing bigger nations to utterly crush smallernations without any hinderance. This is a flaw exacerbated by the clear favouritism towards the pirates who get several mechanics that clearly favour them, including that every other player can easily switch to pirates but not to another nation. As a result the pirates are merrily steamrolling everyone as many in other nations give up in frustration while pirates grow ever stronger.The result is that there is barely any age of sail experience to be had here. It is gank or be ganked. Which gets old.			"

Early Access Review
								I was skeptical at first, but the game is extremely entertaining. I bought the game two nights ago and already have almost 24 hours logged. I've assaulted two ports alongside massive fleets and levelled my profile to level three. Everything in the game feels solid, from the level up speed to the sense of achievement.The game almost works like Mount and Blade: Warband does in regards to the sailing map. Time is sped up and you can find/initiate battles anywhere in the world. These battles take place in smaller ""instances"" just like M&B. The combat is nice and firing cannons feels and sounds satisfying. Gameplay is very engaging because you can choose what your cannons shoot; cannon balls, chained cannon balls or grapeshot. Each type has a different effect on the target. The ability to play with a clan or friends is very useful for many poeple, but it is also possible to enjoy the game while playing solo (like me).8.7/10 in it's current state, insane amounts of potential that can be harnessed by the devs if they introduce things like better upgrades for ships, more options for traders or even just more ships in general.Note: Do not buy this game if you want literally 24/7 action. The game has an element of simulation to it, so do not expect an arcade experience with constant stimulation. The game requires you to sail and spend time making good decisions.EDIT (70 hours playtime): Since this review has gotten so much attention, I feel like I should update it with more of my thoughts. This game isn't just about getting bigger ships and more gold. It offers a unique sensation you feel when you participate in something bigger than yourself. Seeing the United States chat spam ""USA USA USA"" after every victory is funny, but also simultaneously very thrilling. Accomplishing goals alongside teammates and knowing that you contributed is a special kind of sensation. Most people feel it through organized team sports, but I can also feel it through Naval Action. Only a few games have ever gotten this feeling out of me (Planetside 2 and good ol' Minecraft faction server days to name a couple). TLDR; the satisfaction of teamwork and contributing to your nation's fights is where a lot of the fun comes from in Naval Action, at least for me.			"

TL;dr Excellent game, especially considering it's current phase (alpha). Absolutely worth it for anyone interested in piracy, sailships or just simply the ""Age of Sails"".The ships in the game are absolutely magnificent. They really put effort into making them and anyone who loves building models of these old but majestic ships will certainly love the amount of detail and work put into the ships, not to mention being able to see the ships ""come alive"" as they sail across the sea in the game.Another beautiful (though some might say terrifying) part of the game is the combat. Watching a ship as it turns with the wind, all it's gun ports open, the barrels of every cannon aimed directly at your ship and then seeing the rolling broadside as each gun is fired in succession is simply fantastic (and, yes, terrifying). The muzzleflashes light up the side of the ship and the sails, but is quickly hidden within a thick cloud of gunpowder smoke. Often the smoke from the gunpowder is so thick and heavy that entire ships can be hidden behind it. And the sound of the cannons is brilliant. They have loud, deep booms which scale as you get larger cannons, or even carronades.The part of the game that still requires the most development though is the Open World part. This part of the game is still very barebones (the basic framework is up but it requires more work for certain, but then again, it IS alpha stage). The UI is largely, perhaps even entirely, a placeholder UI. The functionality is there, but it is not very appealing (again, it is alpha so beautification comes later). Is this game worth it ?In my opinion, absolutely! If you like sailships, definitely. If you liked the old Sid Meiers Pirates or Pirates of the Burning Sea, then absolutely.However, as always, I encourage people to watch Youtube videos, reviews, twitch streams and so on to get a better idea of what the game is about, how it works, what it looks like and so on to make a decision.Anyways, long wall of text, but then again, it's meant for someone curious about the game :)			"

								Naval action is a beautiful game about the age of sail, it gets its charm from the time period it is based off on which no other game currently really does except badly made ones, ones which do not exist or assassins creed, which is mainly a land based game and it doesnt provide the realism that Naval Action does. Naval Action is purely a ship based game, no walking on land or walking around on the ships however this does not mean that boarding is not a thing, whether you are a pirate or you sail for any of the numerous navies you can capture enemy ships and either take her a prize, sell her or even just sink her and keep the possible loot for your self for trading purposes.The game also features a crafting system which you can use to craft ships, however if crafting is not something for you you can buy ships from the stores or find a crafter which can craft a ship to your specifications, there are plenty of crafters out there.Upgrades allow you to change the qualities of your ships, most upgrades have some short of downside which means that you have to pick and choose which ones best fit your style, you also have a limited amount of upgrades slots and if your ship looses all its durabilities(lives) you will loose the ship and all its durabilitesPositives:-many beautiful ships ranging from the tiny lynx(schooner) to the giant first rate 138 gunner that is the santisima-an open world with ports and plenty of enemies to fight-Great visuals and amazing looks-simple UI-everything isnt done for you, navigation and such is up to you so you can get lost-Both PVE and PVP servers so if you dont like PVP you can always be on the PVE server and be sure that you are safe from getting attacked by players, however if you like PVP join on in the exciting PVP on the PVP Server!Negatives:-UI although simple is not the most easy to use as it is very much work in progress and it does not look pretty-the game can be very demanding on your system, you need at least a decent cpu and gpu to play the game thus stopping entry level systems from being able to run this game at decent(30 fps and above) frame rates-No tutorial(there is a good beginners guide by me here though: 


YouTube™ Video: Naval Action Beginners Guide

Neutral:-The travel time on the Open World can be a bit excessive however depending on the person, it might be too fast or too slow, I find it personally fine where it isrecommended links: Naval action wiki: http://navalactionwiki.com/ Video guides by olav:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXxCN4OQuXYfe8cdzta7S8E0Ku5yNR790There is another review on here that Ant has put up, with a lot of negative comments for it. Forlorne Hope wrote this in response, and had it spread over four comments due to a 1000 character limit. He opted to delete it, with no response. It is unsurprising he deletes any comments that disagree with him so that he creates this aura of agreement. It is a shame that Steam allows one to do so. Now, I edit my own review to let it be more widely known:You have to wonder why someone would spend so much time bashing a game, instead of listing a review and moving on. The feedback could be useful, but, from what I gather, this user has decided to remove any the development team's direct feedback on the game, right here, rather than letting people leave their comments and have a productive discussion.That said, this player has decided to try to do exactly what he accuses others of doing: Silencing those of differing opinions.Let us address this review point by point:He cites that there is nothing to due, as there are not enough people sailing around. Yet, it would be interesting to figure out just where this player was sailing. There is plenty of traffic in the Antilles. There is plenty of traffic around Cuba/Haiti. There are quieter zones as well, such as the Gulf.He states that the massive grind is a huge turn-off, yet... there is no need to grind. Smaller vessels are viable, as are larger ones. The Lynx, the lowest ranked vessel in the game, is great for running down Trader's Lynxes, which are what people run their high-value cargo in (due to their high speed upwind).Concerns of optimization and lack of UI are curious, as it is an alpha game, where optimization is towards the end, and UI will be worked on once the features themselves are in. The developers have said this themselves.Content patches are generally monthly, with new patch notes for October already posted. New ships are regularly added, new mission types are in this patch, forts along coast lines are in this patch, land in OW battles has been in for some time, and land in port battles is still coming. A ""lack of content"" seems to me to simply say, ""I want it all, and I want it now.""The playerbase has contracted from peak times when huge content patches were added. This is shocking to none. In a lull period between patches, the game still hovers around 800 players at peak hours, and 400 players at off-peak hours. In an alpha game.As far as microtransactions go, I believe they are still working on that, with potential changes to come. I do not believe anything is finalized yet.The ultimate concerns of this player comes down to the developer staff, and in particular, one person. Simply put, Ant doesn't like admin, and seems to have made it his goal to do a character assassination of him, and of the game. He still brings it up regularly, and tries to make an issue out of it. And yet, the key thing this player was complaining about is being added in this month's patch anyway.Maybe this player wants to have an honest assessment of the game. Maybe he has the integrity to allow for a differing view. We'll know that he does if this response is still here in a week or two.If he simply deletes it, well, then we know he just has an ax to grind, and should be given that level of concern.			"

								I loved this game for about a year and a half...until I hated it.  It's a game with a ton of potential, but I'm now confident it'll go unrealised with these devs.ProsCombat is great - ship combat is very authentic (from what I can imagine) and there's an element of strategy and skill involvedShip and cannon sounds are done wellConsDevs are stubborn. - Insisting mechanics that the community complains are awful are actually fantastic and the community just doesn't know any better.  Then, months and months later finally changes them.Devs first Open World game and it shows. - The OW map is really just a lobby you can sail around in (and ""sail"" is used loosely because it's incredibly simplified from the combat instanced version of sailing)There is often nothing to do in OW - There are some paltry NPC combat missions and it's incredibly boring after doing it once.Devs are a small team (in the Ukraine) and development takes a long time.Devs show a lack of maturity and don't take criticism well.Port battles have no Port in them.....LULShip progression and Overall gameplay mechanics reward arms racing to 1st Rates - therefore battles end up being whichever side has more 1st RatesComplete lack of content for anything other than aimlessly sailing around picking fightsAfter being active in the forums over the last year and a half of development, I can tell you that the developers have no idea what they are doing when it comes to designing an OW game.  They had a great Arena-style Age of Sail Naval combat game in early closed Alpha.  Then, they decided to go OW, and are really just taking stabs in the dark with regards to gameplay mechanics.  Each time they introduce a new gameplay mechanic it's either incredibly flawed or incredibly boring.Maybe the game becomes great in another 2 years or so, but I just don't believe in these developers abilities to make this game interesting.  Sad really, because the core naval combat from whence the game came was really solid and very fun.			"

								When this game first came out it was tremendous.  So much fun to sit and play for hours and hours.  Then it became popular enough the clickers and whinere heard about it.After they came a small minority began screaming loudly they would quit they would post bad reviews etc unless the game was changed.Now instead of grand fleets patrolling thier waters and brave merchants risking it all to avoid pirates in order to make a buck, you now have teleports and fast traveling speedboats. Nothing more but about 50 players in US prime time grinding pve missions on pvp servers and speedboating away from any pvp.All this is done so they can attack empty ports.Any attempt at pvp is met with running or disconnected pcs and name calling.Game is a complete joke now and a waste of money.

								Credit to 'Garbol' for this review, literally couldn't have said it better myself. With myself having 360+ hours I beleieve the developers need to get their fingers out.The game is plauged by questionable development decisions.Features being implemented that were never asked for by the community.Changes to damage model, mast thickness.Poor communication form developers.Lack of basic tutorial.Lack of user friendly GUI.People keep posting on forums to shift attention to bugs and features that could actually help the game but... Hey new damage model and now we have alpha to our beta on dev-branch alpha client... Devs recently stated that they will cut thier communication with the community because we were mean... well now, if critical post of your work on the internet get so much behind your skin maybe you should hire a community manager that can filter out hatefull and not helpful posts and comments note: that dosen't mean banning people left and right.After a while Naval action feels like a job with lousy pay and not a game to enjoy in the evenings.Again, Credit to 'garbol' for this review.

Early Access Review
								As much as I would love to see a game like this succeed, I must recommend that you avoid spending money on this game right now. If you are interested, I suggest you wait till it releases and watch the reviews then. Let me explain why.I have many more hours in this game then is posted in my steam information. I was a closed alpha, pre steam, tester. At the time their was a small group of Russian or Euro testers that numbered, less than 50 as far as I can tell. The second batch of testers, another 50ish, included many Americans. I was one of those testers. I believe that was in early 2014 or 2015.  Either way, I have been involved in this game from closed alpha, to early access, to sea trials, to open world going on years now. There are definately things I like about this game. The ships are pretty, the world and its size is epic and the damage model is great but a pretty world and pretty ships isn't all their is to a game or a reason to put your trust in it. Now to the critiques and why I say avoid the game. I will start with the most inflammatory and work backwards so that you read the most important stuff first.1. The admin is a disgrace and the worst possible spokesperson for this game that they could have found and he is an absolute failure as a development administrator.  The problem is he is evidently the money man and manages the development team. Just about any problem in NA can be traced back to this man but you can't get rid of the boss.     a. He has called us !@#holes and refused to apologise after the backlash.     b. him or his team have cheated by helping the russians in the game. When you call them out about it you are threatened with being banned if you don't provide proof. Well, this isn't a court of law and I don't need a picture to know what I saw or a recording to know what I heard. One example happened over a year ago before the game went to steam. We capped a Russian playing Danish. His ship had six upgrade slots. Ships in NA only have 5 uprade slots! Unfortunately, during the first fight using it the internet crashed and we hadn't taken a screenshot of it yet.      c. More recently he has blamed the US players from ruining the game because we dare fight our battles while we are online and on a global server. You see it hurts his russian buddies because we play while they are sleeping and vice versa. Its us though that ruin the game. His RUS buddies get a pass for some reason even though they do the same thing back.      d. Recently if was found out that the Russian clan RUS was using a dupe exploit to dupe ships and high end and rare mods. We had suspicions that they had been doing this for months. We were often threatened when we brought this up. After doing some major research and the seeking out of loose lips we found out that the head of the Russian clan was doing this and the devs knew and were willing to protect them if it ever came out. When it recently came out, not one player was punished in any way for cheating and then on the heals of that the us player base gets blamed for ruining the game.      e. The admin started responding to critiques by claiming that he wasn't fixing stuff because players weren't supporting him in the forum reviews as if we have some obligation to defend his game. These are a small number of complaints I have about the admin. This is simply a couple of examples of a long laundery list of the huge negative impact the admin has on the game and the players with his insulting comments, Russian bias, cheating, and attacks on the US player base and I havn't even touched how he has developed the game. I know of not one person in the entire game that has been around and interacted with the man that likes him. He is a tool of epic proportions and he is nearly enough of a reason to stay clear and ask for my money back from PayPal. (I got this game for free as a tester but my second account was paid for)2. The development of the game is at best amaturish. I fear it will never be finished. The game has existed since 2014 at least and they still spend the majority of their time on the damage model. Now I will give it to them, the damage model is good so why can't they move on and actually bring content into the game.      a. They rarely listen to the community. It is true that they can point out certain mechanics that were brought to the game through pressure from the community but in every case they did it poory, incompletely and when some of them didn't work they ...     b. They don't balance imperfect mechanics. Everything but the damage model is either off or on. Balance is not a part of their vocabulary for most mechanics.     c.  They are schizophrenic with the mechanics which is wasting so much time. For instance, originally they wanted us to get back into fights quickly so ships would have multiple durabilities, then they wanted to test lesser durabilities so they reduced the number of large ship durabilities to as low as one. Then they said it was hard on the noobs so they were gonna bring back duras to the larger ships which led to an announcement not a month later that the next patch will take all duabilites away so that all ships only have one.      Again, this just scratches the surface of the development issues. The admin will actually claim they have developed more mechanics than anyother game at this stage and to that I have to just laugh. They remind me of a construction addage that says you build to 80% perfection because the other 20% will take 80% more time. They are taking so much time on a mechanic that is already close to perfection instead of actually developing mechanics that will keep people in the game and bring in new people to try it out. I hate to be critical about and industry I know little about but it is quite obvious that these guys are either a) not working on this full time because they sleep in and spend all our money on trips to Dubai or b) are working on another project that we don't know about and this game recieves only a small portion of their attention. Either way you can probably understand why I say stay away from the game until release.3. Where did our money go? I don't remember the exact numbers but I know that they have made a butt load on the game yet they haven't hired any developers to speed the game up? Where did it go? Maybe there is an answer to this but I havn't heard it yet.4. This is specifically to western hemisphere players. They have designed the main content driver, port battles, so that half of the western players can't participate. It has been brought up for months by tons of different posts and they have yet to do anything about it. They arbitrarily block Portbattles from being sceduled at a time that makes it near impossible for western half of our players from being able to join. In spite of all the complaints and the number of players that stopped playing the game due to it, the devs still refuse to do anything about it yet when their Russian friends wine and complain loudly about ""night flips"" on a global server they react.My conclusion is that the Development manager of this game is incompetent, heavily favors Russian players, and actively doesn't care about north or south american players and maybe even aussies. They spend time fixing issues that don't need fixing instead of building on the game. They have run off more players for their mismanagement and poor development priorities then any toxicity between player groups could have accomplished. They have actively aided or ignored known major exploits when used by their Russian clans and then turned around and blamed the US player base for ruining the game. This has been done through the years with outright insults, implications, poor responses to critiques and cheating and being soft-bellied.  I think the cause of this is the admin. I do not blame other development team members unless they were a part of the cheating and bias.Stay away for now if your smart "

								In short, don't buy now, wait for the full release and then watch new ""let's play videos"" to see if you like what it's become by that time. I've had a lot of fun playing this game, so not reccomending it is something that I do not take lightly. However, I played it long past the point of it being fun and the fun times that I had with it are a distant, albeit a very fond memory. About a year ago, this game was magical. Its world was new and full of promise and possibilities. Most of the people were new to the game and we were all growing in it and shaping its world together. We were all more or less equal and equally searched for good fights and interesting places. The time I spent progressing through ships was pure magic for me; each time I could man a progressively larger ship was exciting. Each time I managed to sail vast distances and find the place I was looking for was pure satisfaction. Then things changed. Some changes made life easier for people and eliminated certain challenges - such as the grid and coordinate system that made traveling vast distances effortless. Other changes drove people from the game. For me, personally, the biggest change was in the players themselves. The novelty wore off after a few months, and soon there were gank squads (pa)trolling different waters and looking for easy targets while running away from a challenge. Finding fair fights became a chore. Trading became a chore. Crafting became a chore. The game itself became a chore and for a while I treated it as such. I would log in, do my trading run or mission grind to raise funds, buy some resources, do some crafting, escape a gank squad, and log off... lather, rinse, repeat... My hope is that the game can offer the same magical feeling to people that I once had about it when it is released and its beautiful world is wiped clean of filth that we the players filled it with over time. My hope is that new players come and learn from those of us who loved this game and watched that love die a slow and agonizing death. My hope is that this game thrives in the future and that new players flock to it and don't forget that this is a game, a distraction from the real world and the real drama, and that in this game the main objective is to have fun, interract with people, and to challenge yourself to some great times on the seas. As of right now, though, all of that is largely missing from the game, and all that remains from the once great pasttime is a grind and endless stream of disappointment. Wait on it, but do not hold your breath.			"

								Would I recommend buying this game at this time? NoI will keep it short and to the point. This game has one of the best and most accurate to date naval combat simulations. The problem is that since leaving combat test which was more MOAB style and the implementation of the 'open world' that combat is now gated behind a barely functional open world that is now depopulated, has huge exploitable mechanics loopholes, lacks content, and has a unrewarding and too fast paced realm vs. realm.You will spend hours and hours searched for PvP only to have 99% of them run away and you in turn running away from the 5 to 1 gank squadrons. Depicting an open world of the age of sail this game does not do well. As an example my 1,000 plus hours of having the game running I have maybe at best 50 hours of PvP combat. The rest was sailing and watching something else or chasing players that didn't want to fight without their gank squadron friends even when they still overmatched me.So while I have no regrets on the money I spent on the game and got my enjoyment out of it when the game had a more viable population, the current state of the game, the gating of what the game does well being behind a broken open world, and the lack of progress in development makes me unable to recommend to another to spend money on it. I can't even recommend buying it as an investment to the concept because it doesn't seem like the proceeds have been directed back into Naval Action in the slightest. While their studio is currently working on a new Ultimate General title.			"

								Let me first state that Naval Action is currently an Early-Access Beta game. There are bugs and ongoing development that can swing the game from balanced to broken within a month.I really enjoyed this and playing just around 1,000 hours it is a game worth playing for those who wish to experience a hard-to-play age of sails game. Being able to play a small cutter ship to the famed 1st rate, Victory, there are countless ships to choose from. PvE and PvP are both supported, but there is a focus towards the PvP experience.That being said, from my point of view, the current development route for this game is unsatisfactory and I am worried about where this game and the developers plan to go with it. For a time being the game was being developed to help young players get through the game without too much grind, and while there is a big grind, it is vastly improved to what it was previously. While I did state that the develeopment can change drastically what seems to be the current goal for this game will be a sour experience for casual players or players with limited time to play. With the game already requiring a large blok of time to ""play properly"" it is concerning that you may need a minimum of 3 hours for every session just to get a few things done. A player who may only have an hour or two at a time will likely not be able to fully appreciate Naval Action or be limited to what they do within the game. There is also currently an online population problem which ultimately if you're looking for players on the open sea, you are more than likely going to find very few, if any at all, after you leave the capital areas of each nation. It is a lonely map out there, some people enjoy it, I do not.Maybe it's just me, and I do enjoy this game, but I'm exhausted in trying to help the developers make a better gaming experience. Am I a ""bitter/dusgruntled veteran?"" Probably, but it doesn't help when the developers flatly state ""a bad review = no new content"" or that everything they have added is ""because you guys wanted it."" I feel there was a goal in mind for the finished product, but I cannot see it anymore, or it has changed to help represent a small portion of the players instead of the vast amount who used to play.

								So heres Naval Action, now you're probably thinking what is this game and how does it play? Well let's cover a few things, first up is open world. Now the Open World is vast, it is the Carribbean and it is geographically accurate to every minute island that is present. Theres multiple ports, for all factions and you can capture ports of other factions. Every port produces goods, uses goods and is either shallow or deep (meaning what ind of ship you can take in). So now lets go into the battles, theyre gorgeous. The sounds, the feel, the waves and sky. Its all gorgeous. The battles take place in instances and whatever happens in the world around your instance also happens there. Theres multiple ship types, gun types, you can get missions from the admiralty (go here and kill this pirate) or you can trade, you can just hunt traders or go after contraband smugglers in your own faction. Now lets go into the bad parts. The forums are a place where nobody can disagree with the fanboys, if you are an American player the admins have something agagainst you, such as suggesting an idea it is usually immediately shot down but when the same admin sees on the Russian forums the same idea they praise it as brilliance. The second one is the grind, it is absolutely asinine in the early stages and just manages to make it worse on the higher levels. You start off with a garbage ship and no money and on average a fight will last you 30-45 mins for 50xp and a bit of gold. Now youre thinking thats not bad, but the amount of XP you need to reach rank 2 is 1000. Thats absolutely ridiculous. The AI is also some kind of super human with everything they do is absolutely perfect such as aiming, sailing, taking NO penalties to loss of crew (usually slows reaction time and steering down a terrible degree). PVP is there and its pretty meh. Unless you plan on doing nothing but dedicating all your time to this game this isn't for you. While the battles, crafting and sounds are fun it is drawn down by terrible AI, awful forums and bad decisions by the forum community who the devs listen to. I would give it a 7/10 however I do recommend it if you arent active in the forums and just want to play.Edit: Adjusted to 7/10 due to very quick patches and on time updates that are balanced.			"

								First and foremost, this is not a perfect game and if you are looking for a polished game wait before you purchase Naval Action. The developers of Naval Action have been highly influenced in developing their game by Pirates of the Burning Sea which is incredible to me having been a former PotBS player. Naval Action has a modern graphics engine(that looks amazing), but when you play it you get the distinct feel of PotBS minus the avatars. I for one miss what PotBS was and it will always occupy a special place in my gaming experience. So to see a game that is essentially in homage to PotBS is impressive and a must buy in my opinion. Most importantly and the reason I’m posting here, is the developers of Naval Action have been extremely interactive with the community and open to suggestions. Most of the major game features have been voted on and discussed on the forum extensively with the community. They are not making Naval Action in a vacuum and are using the forum as a sounding board to develop the game that the community wants. Naval Action is clearly being developed as a labor of love by some truly talented people. I’d love to see many people buy Naval Action to add their voices to the community and help make this game everything it should be. Now while I’m very excited about Naval Action, it does play very slow and is like an age of sail simulator. It  emphasizes developing skills very much like an FPS like aiming individual cannons to hit their targets, adjusting your yardarms manually, and plotting open sea travel. Nonetheless, the potential of Naval Action is enormous and with a little polish it could become an incredible gaming experience.Lastly, If you think $40 is too expensive for an early access game then I defy you to find another game similar to Naval Action with an active population which is still in development. It is not a cookie cutter game, but a unique experience that is worth every cent of the purchase price. I’d like to invite you to Naval Action and hope you enjoy the journey as much as I have. Cheers!			"

								Disclaimer: This review is coming from a former EVE Online player, so my perspective regarding what is and is not a complex game might be somewhat warped. I see another game with a huge amount of potential that could turn into something great -- and in a lot of ways it reminds me of old EVE. I hope Naval Action doesn't squander that potential.This is not a complex game.I know, judging from a number of reviews on here, you might assume this is a complicated and convoluted game. It is not. Please do not let these opinions discourage you from trying this game -- It is very close to exceptional.I can see how some people might be intimidated with how the game appears upon initially starting it up. However, if you stick with it, you'll learn it very quickly. There is also an in-game ""Help"" channel that is quite useful, and many YouTube tutorial videos at your disposal. Personally, I was able to teach myself the game in less than two hours without using videos. I did search the forums for a couple things, but I was able to find answers fairly easily.1. Is this game worth $40?Yes, I believe it is. When you consider the amount of content already, considering it is an early access MMO, it certainly justifies the price tag. I come from a generation very much accustomed to paying $15 monthly for MMO access, so one in the sub-$60 range and without subscription fees is quite welcome. I do understand the reluctance to pay into an unfinished game, but that's a whole other discussion entirely.2. Do you have to like naval ships/trading in order to enjoy this game?No, not at all. In fact, I am more of a third-person shooter, survival, and sci-fi gamer. It's actually caused me to start reading about old ships and sailing when I never have before.3. Are you saying this game is like Eve Online? I played that game and it sucked.No. This game is a lot more engagingly interactive. The combat is action-packed, and very intense. It has none of the bad qualities of Eve.There's more I could say, but I think you should really just try it. I ended up keeping it, and I'm glad I did.			"

Early Access Review
								With just shy of 600 hours in game, I can tell you the game is fun and has a solid structure.  However they have some very glaring issues that need to be resolved before I can recommend the game or even return to playing it. As well I held off writing this review for months in hopes that the devs would fix these issues. Before I continue, you need to understand that most players join the in game nation that they reside in. US joins US, Brits join the Brits, Spanish to Spain, and so on. 1st, RvR (primary endgame content) is locked out between the hours of 9pm est and 3am est. This means if you are a US based player that does not log in till after 9pm est, you are not allowed to participate in any RvR port battles at all. 2nd, Due to the RvR system, Port Battles can take place during time that are not optimal for a faction. Ie. Attacks by US nation just prior to the lock out at 8pm est is very early in the morning for defending nations. Or other nations attacking the US in the middle of the work day. These two issues have created friction between nations and players both in game and on the forums. US/AUS players are upset that they are unable to play end game content during their prime time. And non-US/AUS players are upset that port battles can take place during their night. Due to the size of the player base, Avg around 450 to peak of under 900 players online and the large map, regional servers are not really an option. (don’t be fooled by the NA server, it is mostly dead and still follows the same Lock Out rules above.) In addition to these issues, the devs of the game, have been mostly silent on the issue. The last they said is that they are thinking about reverting back to an old mechanic of Port Timers. However this mechanic left the game with very similar issues. Ports can only be attacked during the defending nation's prime time. So US/AUS players are unable to attack EU ports and EU players are unable to attack US/AUS ports. Outside of these issues, the game is overall fun, again the game is overall fun! Pros:FUN!, Who doesn’t want to captain a ship during the great age of sail? Combat is a blast, well designed and in depth, solid damage models and does not feel arcady. Graphics/Smooth Gameplay: Graphics, yeah they are not the best. The game runs on unity, however the graphics look good for a game that runs as well as it does in early access. Sea gals!Cons: The aforementioned Port Battle mechanic, IE. end game is broken. The Open World is empty. Aside from a few NPCs, that don’t attack you (devs said they will change that), there is not much to do in open world. Most development has been on PVP. So if you are looking for PVE, hold off. Pro & Con: This stuff is good and bad both at the same time. The trading mechanic is solid and can be fun. However it barely if at all impacts the game. Ships and good ships can be built simply by having the correct buildings in the correct ports. No need to trade with friendly/non-friendly ports. Crafting as well has a solid base, however needs to be flushed out. Crafting can be done by anyone and everyone so being an expert crafter doesn’t really feel special. If you have the mats, you can build just about any ship. Diplomacy, again, solid base but needs to be worked on. You are either allied with a nation or at not. Being at war is the same as not allied, you can attack them, they can attack you. War means nothing.Community, the community can be an awesome group of guys or a really whiny pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ They are highly opinionated and passionate about their play style, I’ve seen (and sad to say partaken in) several all out brawls on the forms. That being said, I know some really awesome guys from both inside and outside of my alliance. And without naming names, they have a top notch RP player that adds a lot of depth to the game. In short, the game is fun and has a LOT of promise, however it also has some broken mechanics that means I can not play the game as intended. Till those are fixed, I can not recommend the game.  Note, the devs have said they hope to come out of Early Access soon. Once done I’ll definitely be revisiting and updating my review then.*****UP DATE*********So devs just openly attacked US players. Many players are not happy and leaving the game. http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19383-conquest-windows-being-added-to-solve-night-flips-feedback-thread-heavily-moderated/&do=findComment&comment=381260 "

								Do not purchase this game if you are an American or non-EU player.  The developers of this have made decision after decision that favors one player base of the game over the other (EU players).  The anti-US player bias in this game is toxic and destructive to the player base, despite making up roughly 40% of the their game sales.  The game is pretty and runs smoothly albeit on an outdated UI.  The combat mechanics in this game are excellent and sailing around is truly a fun experience.  Unfortunately the terrible developer support and toxic community are what has ruined a great game.  There is no other content other than campaign based RVR (realm vs realm).  It's frustrating how much potential this game has and how the development team squanders and seems unaware of it.  The game is currently dying slowly, now the server populations on respective servers barely crack 600 and 150.  A year ago this game had 1500 people on regularly and the lack of content, development and a toxic community has dwindled away most of it.  I'd love to be able to give this game a positive review.  Unfortunately the dev team released a number of angry tirades and development choices today that have left the player base fractured and irreparable.  I've been an alpha/beta tester in games for decades, I'm currently in the blizzard friends and family program and have been in every blizzard release alpha in the past 10 years.  I've been around the proverbial development block so to speak.  NEVER NEVER NEVER have I seen a game run as poorly as this one.  Do not purchase this game.Please see the below meltdown threads by the head developer as proof.http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19383-conquest-windows-being-reduced-to-10-hours-to-solve-night-flips-feedback-thread-heavily-moderated/&page=5#comment-381260http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19383-conquest-windows-being-reduced-to-10-hours-to-solve-night-flips-feedback-thread-heavily-moderated/&do=findComment&comment=381291http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19383-conquest-windows-being-reduced-to-10-hours-to-solve-night-flips-feedback-thread-heavily-moderated/&do=findComment&comment=381315http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19383-conquest-windows-being-reduced-to-10-hours-to-solve-night-flips-feedback-thread-heavily-moderated/&do=findComment&comment=381328 "

								Lmao what a joke this game has become. Instead of listening to the majority of players, they decide to listen to the crying minority and have completely destroyed their game. Why sail in the open world when you can just teleport? Sometimes I forget the game is called Naval Teleportation, silly me. Want to craft a ship? Well now you have to find extra stuff that only comes from certain areas, good luck finding it. Looking for a game with tons of interaction in the open world? Well it ain't here. This game is basically like staring at spreadsheets all day. There's nothing to look at but numbers. But what about the battles, you ask? HAHAHAHA yea right. Nobody battles. If they can't attack you and out number you 10 to 1, they'll just hide in a port all day. And like I said, why sail anywhere when you just teleport. Like I said, it's a spreadsheet game.All in all, if you're one of those players that like to kill a completely perfect game because it's ""too hard"" then I highly recommend this game. They will listen to you complain. 10/10 best clicking simulator ever.			"

								This game is like a hardcore version of sid meier's pirates, we have manual sailing available (we can control independently the sails at the front and rear of the ship to take advantage of the wind) , no indicator showing where we are on the map, we have to rely on our compass and landmarks, wind has much effect on the sails, we have to adjust our cannon's angle manually correctly to hit at the right distance, take into consideration how the ship is swaying due to the waves and also waves can stop our shots. Hitting a ship trying to flee at long range is a bit of a challenge when we are new but it feels very rewarding when we finally manage to place that shot.Ships can be capsized and the game world is huge.I also like that we don't have some weird magical abilities like in many games with naval battles.Trading and crafting are in game at the moment but they need more content and polishing I think.And finally the ships look gorgeous. I want to experience and hopefully own every one of those beautiful ships.			"

								Oh boy what a ride that was.The game is plauged by questionable development decisions.Features being implemented that were never asked for by the community.Changes to damage model, mast thickness.Poor communication form developers.Lack of basic tutorial.Lack of user friendly GUI.People keep posting on forums to shift attention to bugs and features that could actually help the game but... Hey new damage model and now we have alpha to our beta on dev-branch alpha client... Devs recently stated that they will cut thier communication with the community because we were mean... well now, if critical post of your work on the internet get so much behind your skin maybe you should hire a community manager that can filter out hatefull and not helpful posts and comments note: that dosen't mean banning people left and right.After a while Naval action feels like a job with lousy pay and not a game to enjoy in the evenings.I would recomend to stay away for the time being.

								I have decided to add to my original review since many changes have come to pass as the devs continue to add, modify and change the game.  See the bottom for added comments.I have had the pleasure and sometimes the pain, yes pain, of playing Naval Action through the original battle sim on to the launch of the open world.Visually the devs have done amazing work. As you sail around the detail astounds you.  You need a nice graphics card and machine to truly enjoy it.  Last night I noticed that the shallows near islands had become sand beaches and rocky shoals.   Another upgrade to the whole visual aspect of the game.   Watch some of the videos.There are a few negative reviews regarding the grind and the time it takes to sail from place to place.  Also about nothing being fast and taking too long to complete.Have you ever sailed in a yacht on a sunny day? You really do not get anywhere fast.Real life age of sail battle could take all day to resolve if they even were resolved.  In Naval Action you could be in a battle well over an hour  and then sink if you can't escape a losing battle.  It is the age of sail after all.If you want instant gratification and super powerful ships the moment you buy and join the game then you might as well go elsewhere.   You need to earn your place on the seas and there is a lot of help for you to get where you need to be to have fun in larger ships and sail with skill.The initial grind can be very frustrating but everyone in the game has to do it. There are legal in game ways to make it a bit faster but as you get better it goes faster and you gain a larger crew which allows you to sail larger ships and gives you more options as to how you want to interact.Some trade mostly and build ships. Others constantly organize port battles and manage the wars against enemies. Several like to backstab fellow pirates and pay the price.The world is in flux. Ports change hands, Power bases grow and shrink and ships get lost.    We all have lost our best ships in a battle but live to fight again.If you want to join a game still being improved (and sometimes in ways we might not all like being tested), still growing  with a good base of skilled people in all of the nations from all over the world, then give it a try.I have played in ""free"" games and pay games where bots have taken over the game and completely ruined them.  This game depends on your skill and your clan and country's ability to hold important ports for supplies and staging and not on some computer bot working against you.Join the grind, join the community and enjoy the game.   There is nothing more enjoyable than after an hour or more of tough battle with cannons firing, smoke wafting across the water and hearing your crew cheer when the dreaded enemy loses a mast and then you sink or board the ship and seize it!New to this review.You will read some fairly negative reviews on this game and some of them do make a point about some of the changes taking place in Naval Action.In my opinon as a game in flux through continuing development it is still a great game with some new wrinkles.Graphically they added shoals, seagulls , rocks and other fine details making the whole environment richer.  New ships are being added all the time.  Tweaks for battles keep us on our toes as well.Many are unhappy that fleets are back as they prevent good single player battles in open water.Others complain about buying crew you lose in battles or if your ship gets sunk or taken.There are many options in the game from pure battle to trading or crafting that are still viable but you must take care and do some planning or yes incur huge costs for repair or replacement of your ships and crews.All in all still a great game that I enjoy very much and when you add the social aspect of clan membes from all over the world working and fighting together in game it makes all the rough spots and complaints go away.Still say give it a try and join the fray!

								So far this is what I think: The good bits...Great combat and realistic age of sail battle gameplay.The graphics.The helpful community (very small).The bad bits....Travel in game just simply takes way too long, and I mean WAY too long. Crossing 25% of the map one way your are looking at an hour at least if the wind is in your favour.Crafting system way too convoluted, especially when coupled with sailing time of picking stuff up and moving to a ship yard.Small development team which at times appear not to care about the people who have helped pay their bills :) - a read through their forums would show this. The UIs are awful, basic and completely uninspiring.Very low population that has shrunk over the last year. On the main PVP1 server I see an average of 250 online.It would seem to me that they have written this game in Unity 3D. It looks like they have made extensive use of teh asset market. i.e. they have brought the water, the tools for making land, the models of the ships and a number of other things and thrown them together with a combat system which is why (IMHO) bug fixing and reactive maintenance is taking them too long.  There are bugs that were reported over a year ago (look at forums) that have not been addressed at all.I really have thought that this game, that does on the face of it, have some wonderdul potential and fills a niche quite nicely will unfortunately never actually make it to general release.  Judging by sales it looks like the cow has already been milked, another reason I worry that the game will never reach final release.If I were you I would wait until general release to see if it happens. Only buy if you have the money to waste and fully understand that you will be getting something that has plenty of bugs, is not finished at all and have plenty of spare time to put in.  So I really cannot recommend this game.			"

								I bought this game last February, my friends who played PotbS got into it hot and heavy, we started a clan, and enjoyed the naval combat for many hours. I have over 580 hours in this game, all prior to the major Port/land update.  Since then I've had zero desire to play. Here's why:Firstly, some of the bugs were annoying, it was an Alpha build, so no biggie, I knew the updates were coming to fix those things, so I took time off to wait. Since then I have seen all the updates and patches and fixes. I can say that I really like this Dev team. They know what they are doing as far as code and art, and all other facets of software development. What I don't like is where they are going with the game.  They're adding perks and skills to the game, thus making it go the way of Pirates of the burning Sea. That is an excercise in failure. Skills, changes, and Nerfs destroyed that game, also the fail econ and the Pay to Win implementation.  This game is gorgeous! However, they're taking it down an ugly road in it's development.  When we first started the game it was slow combat, as all Tall Ship combat was. Adding skills and Perks is going to take away the nature of the combat and make it a Button Skill game.  Not OK. Other reasons I left this game:  Each player is forced into a Faction. - You can not simply roam the high seas as you wish.  No Pirate Heavens. Port Battles - Turning out to be exactly like PotbS. The game devolves into having to fight for ports.  Which REALLY sucks if you're Pirate, because all the nations just gang up on you until they need your help, then they backstab you anyway.  Ship Speeds: These were previously broken. Where an SOL would go over 8kts. Then players can add fittings, rigging etc. to increase this speed even more.  This is game breaking, they fixed it at some point, but ships the size of the Constitution were too fast and could chase down smaller, faster ships. (Not sure if they will attempt to reign in the insane speeds of the larger ships at some point, but it's not OK that ships of great size would go over 13kts for the time period, regardless of fittings and such.  Pirates can't enter ""Neutral"" ports labeled as such, but Nationals can. - HUH? Seems quite dumb to me. There's no Reputation system.  - At the time I played Pirates could only enter Nation's ports if they had a Letter of Marque. Otherwise, you were simply denied the ability by the game mechanics. The problem with that was you had to go INTO the port to get the Letter...  Have they fixed this? Or implemented those mechanics all the way? They allow fittings on ships that improve performance in some way, some of them have drawbacks, which is fine. However, players can not fully customize their ships. Players, (especially painful for Pirates) can not change what their cannon load outs are. EVERY single Cannon in the game has a Class assigned to it, and every ship is allowed a specific range of allowed Gun Classes.  There needs to be more customization. At the time I stopped playing it felt like people desperately wanted to fit a Square Peg into a Round Hole. We asked for the ability to more customize our ships. I don't think they're going to bother with that at this point. Port Water depth: I understand that with Physics being a factor in game design, players need to be able to enter ports. Period. I don't care what port it is.  Obviously HUGE ships like SOLs couldn't enter shallow water ports, but other ships could. In the game, even now, most ships have a problem with collision with the bottom.  IT'S ANNOYING AF!! You can get ganked because the bottom stopped you dead in the water inches from the port, or you can't enter the port at all.  The problem with this mechanic is that it's like this for EVERY SHIP. Not just ships of great size.  Even if you can outrun potential gankers, you should still be able to enter a port. No In-Game map tools. OK, this was cool at first, but when grouping up with others, it's a PITA. ""Hey, where are you?"" Is the question of the day if you're not in the same port as others.  The game does NOT mark you on the map, not even a crude approximation based on your navigation. Nope. Nothing.  It's cool, but not practical.  At some point they need to implement tools to do this, make it a ""Crew Perk"" or Officer talent or something. Otherwise, you'll spend 3 hours sailing from Cuba to the South Eastern part of the map. Don't get lost!People would log out because they would get frustrated at sitting in front of their computer for 3 hours... DOING NOTHING. (You couldn't set your ship to sail by itself because the server would log you out after 30 minutes bcause you're AFK. - which is dumb, because your ship is moving.) Not sure if they fixed this.I would recommend this game over every other Naval combat game on the market, because right now, it's the best of what we've got on the market.   (Still hoping that if they're going to add real physics to the game, they won't keep adding skills based on buttons to press on your keyboard, true ship customization, and Pirate Havens. Because that's what I'd do.)			"

								I have played the game, Naval Action, for near 1000 hours. It let me feel really disappointed.The dev emphasis on its ALPHA test, not a official game, and they are going to add more contents later.

Even though, the players have promoted many idea, discussions and voting[2] about the contents on the official forum or on the steam, the dev still only keep on changing the BATTLE system.Now the players are leaving the game by their actions[3]. let the dev test the BATTLE sytem themselves using HOURS every night.

								This game could have been one of the greats, but the Devs are not up to doing that it seems. I think they spend to much time deleting forum post that are not, well lets just say ""Singing their praises"".Everytime they change the game its not in baby steps, they take to it with a chainsaw. Started off being a great game, but sad to say with their changes, that they have made over the last few months in a effort to increase the PvP, they have done just the oppersite. Players care more about their paint jobs for their ships than PvP. Trying to get an open word fight in near impossible these days.It also the community is rather toxic and know of many players that have gone to other games for just that reason. If they  want to make the game more enjoyable overnite GET RID OF CLOBAL CHAT. There is simply no need for it. As the game is right now I would say not to buy and if you do wait untill the price drops or is on sale @ -50%			"

								At the time of this review i had put 100 hours into his game in 1 week after launch on steam. Its's a damn good game and certainly has the potential to be a very good MMO.  Let me start with the positives of this game, Keep in mind this is still in alpha.1. PvP is great. Battles can go on for 1 hour 30min, however, they dont feel like that at all. machanics are all there and keeps you intrested in the battle all the way to the end. Oh, fleet size pvp can get as big as 25 vs 25. 2. Visuals are also very good, swaying over the waves as you try aiming at other countrys ships to sink it. priceless.3. Port Battles. Allthough port battles are still in develpment atm its still a joy to join up with other people from your selected nation to go capture ports from your enemys.4. A good selection of nations to pick from.5. Arr, matey, thar be ye booty!  (Be a Pirate)6. Crafting. Its still in its infancy but there is enough there atm to keep you preoccupied, although it still needs alot of work done to it.7. Board and raid other ships. destroy enemy sails with 'chain shot' then whittle down the enemy crew with 'Grape' board the ship than take the loot and ship as a prize.Now some stuff that is in the Gray zone, this stuff is a good idea but still needs alot of work in my eyes:1. The economy. As it stands at the point of writing this review in a alpha build, the economy is broken. There are some people that have got a monopoly on some of the goods and its very hard to get hold of some of the 'goods' to build ships. so the prices of ship building are very high and you will most likely loose any sort of profit. That said i have heard that its ok on other servers but some of the ship crafting needs to be tweeked to balance things.2. 'Durabilty'. On ships you get something called durabilty. These are effectually your lives. rate 7-5 ships have 5 dura (lifes) then rate 4-1 ships you get one less life per rate.  For me personally i would like to only see 1 life per ship but alot of people will disagree with me. 3. Small ships are pretty useless and are used as a 'stepping stone' to get the next Rate ship. I would like to find a way so small ships are used later on in game.4. The map/ Open sea, Its well big. it fits in well with the game and how its done. you have to work out what direction to sail from your compuss and it can & will take hours to get to where you want to go. Its how it should be, however, its a bit boring for the eye. I do believe that they are planning to add things like storms and damage to your ships, etc... this will make it alot more dynamicNow to the bad things in this current Alpha build:1. UI is crap! its only a few blue boxes with text. 2. Its very hard to just pick up the game and start playing it if your new, There is nothing to help you apart from the ingame chat. 3. Missions are extremely repetitive yet they are one of the best ways to get exp and money.4. Feel the grind! The first few days i thought that the exp gain was to fast, however, that changed once i got rank 1st Lt. It takes bloody ages to grind exp and it really is quite painful.5. Current lack of content. There really isnt much in the game atm, howevewr, it is only alpha and i do know some very exciting things are going to be added and alot of rebalancing is going to happen.6. Trading is still very poor. This will get better over time but as it stands there really is not much point as it takes along time to get to port to port.This is what i have made of the game so far from me playing it. For an Alpha stage game it really is solid and well done. If you can keep in mind that its Alpha then alot of the bugs/ balancing issues/ lack of content can be forgiven. there are somethings that i personally need to be changed but everyone is differant. I would suggest you watch a few streams of gameplay and ask lots of questions before buying it, i did, this will give you a better idea if you would like the game or not. one of the best buys i have done for awhile, My £30 was worth every penny.For an Alpha i give it a   ---- 9/10 ----			"

								Over the countless years, I’ve probably encountered over a dozen or more “pirate” games for PC. From Cutthroats to Sea Dogs. From Sid Meier’s to Buccaneer to even getting The Patrician series as it had sailing ships in it.However, I’ve played nothing that is quite like this. Bar, maybe, the sea battles of Sea Dogs. But this categorically leaves Sea Dogs in Davey Jones’s locker along with the rest of the afore mentioned.I’m not saying those games are bad. That’s not true. I played Cuttroats in the 1990’s for hour upon hour. Hunting for that all but elusive Spanish treasure galleon.I just loved the fact that you had a PC game and you could do ANYTHING you wanted to do. They are all an open book to be written as you feel fit. Though, some did have a story line that you could follow, if you so desired.Naval Action is, in my opinion, stunning. The graphics. The ships. You can even build your own ship!! The sea battles. The game play. OK! It may not be for some. I’m sure that some will find it a little tedious to sail from place to place. But I find it tedious that a lot of PC games are just ""wham, bang, thank you mam"", type of games where there very little thought, but lots of action.The fact that in Naval Action, you CAN and WILL get lost in the middle of the Caribbean Sea is... Is... Something to be really proud of.Most likely, you’ll get lost by your own stupid human error. Setting sail from Cuba, you’re headed south to Jamaica. All is OK for the first 10 minutes. Then 10 minutes ends up being 20 minutes and it is now that you start to look around the sea for signs. ANY signs. No Land. No Ships. Not even a flippin’ Albertros to blame. It’s getting dark. The sun’s setting and there’s a mist spreading over the becalming sea. That picture had taken your mind away from your immediate predicament. But regardless, you still watch it slowly setting.Then it’s back to reality.Where the heck am I?What direction did I put myself in?So you check. Why was I heading South East, when I just needed to head South?Oh! Well. At least the designers of the game have given you and “emergency beacon” to use. Use it and it lets you teleport back to your capital city. Depending on which of the numerous nations you decide to choose from at the beginning of the game.But this is almost a use once option. You use it and afterwards, you cannot use it again for another 3hours of game play. So it is to be used at your discretion and used wisely.So, in summing up.If you like the tall ships of the 18th century (And frankly, who doesn’t?).If you would like to command one (And who wouldn’t?)?If you like the Caribbean?If you like a thoughtful game, which has enough intense action in battles, then getting this game would be a most welcome and very wise move, on your part.Sadly, I have to go now and sort my rat infested ship. Then off to try and sort out my flea infested, pox ridden scurvy crew by keeping their tempers blithe with a barrel or two of rum.Oh! Well. The life of an 18th century ships commander isn’t all about treasure, rum, wooden legs, walking the plank and warm seas. It’s not about loosing off a broadside of cannons against some foe and, well, finding the curvaceous talents of the even looser women found in some stinking drinking hole in a place they deem fit to call a port.“So. Arr! Vaass, mateys. I ‘ope to see ye in Port Royal one day. Now... Where’d me flippin’ parrot get to?”. "

								This game has a lot of potential for the gamers that like time sinks. There is no such thing as hoping on and doing a quick mission or pvp battle. To accomplish anything meaniful you need to set aside at least 3-4 hours per session. The OW sailing combined with the rapid change of wind make it painful to get anywhere. Its a whole lot of hurry up and wait and wait some more. The game isn't difficult and the pvp is fun and does require some skill and situational awareness. This is not the game for you if: 1) You dont have a lot of time to play 2) You are looking for fast action3) You are looking for a story line based gameThis is a game for you if:1) You like sandbox games2)Skill based pvp3)Slow action 4)Spending lots of time getting from one place to another with absolutely nothing else to do but afk sail and talk in chatsOverall I started out really enjoying the game because it was fresh and something totally different. But after a month of playing I have decided to uninstall this game.			"

								I want to love this game. The actual combat is amazing, the ships are beautiful, open world is very detailed and well thought out. However, just now, off doing missions on my own, and out of nowhere, in the middle of a mission, 6 Dutch players, with all of their extra ships drop in and gank me. Because for some stupid ♥♥♥♥ing reason, the devs decided that players can get ganked in PRIVATE ♥♥♥♥ING MISSIONS. So no.. at this point in time, I don't advise buying it because it's a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥show of poor planning and dumb ideas being implemented by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s intent of forcing pvp on you all the time, instead of leaving it to specific instances.

								Overall, this is a great game and CAN BE so much fun. The mechanics of it all and the visuals, and even the PvP play can be fun. In all fairness, it is very well done.Over time, there has become a massive imbalance with nation populations. Pirates, although not really a ""nation"" have a vast majority of the players and ports making it nearly impossible to play this game without getting ""ganged up on"" every time you start to sail - and that is if you can even leave your port!When I first started the game many months ago, the balance of nations was much more even. There was plenty of PvP, but you could also sail and play your game without the Pirate Nation taking you down. I have seen other comments about Naval Action that contain similar issues, and who get smack talked by other players being defensive (who are likely ones playing on the pirate side, making their points pretty much irrelevant). This has been MY experience with the game. If others find it a blast to get ganked every time they play, good for them. I don't. I need time in the game to build my ships and money so I actually have resources to PvP with!I'd say if you are going to play this game, you may find it really hard to make any progress unless you become a pirate, and then, this just adds more pirates to the game which is what is making it less fun for a regular player. Perhaps I'll come back to this game after it goes ""live"" and see if you can actually play the game without getting jumped at every turn. PvP isn't fun when you bring a handgun to a fight and the enemy has 20 machine guns.			"

Early Access Review
								I am not going to review the game itself, as it's far too early for this, but I'm going to review how the ""Early Access"" of this game is being handled.It clearly states on Early Acces that you can get involved with this game as it develops. This couldn't be further from the truth. Every major decision is already set in stone, pretermined by polls from early backers. There is pretty much no Developer interaction - the only known Developer admin is hardly posting at all on either the Steam or the official forum. There is no dialogue about future game mechanic changes. Giant threads of people remarkably unhappy about design decisions made in the past being broken (such as pirates not being a nation like the other 7 but very different from them) are just growing without any official word being taken into account. If a poll like the pirate mechanics vote has the overwhelming majority of 71% against pirates capturing ports, and hundreds of replies in it, it really can't be without a dev response at all.There was a response, but you had to watch a certain twitch stream doing a Q&A session (not advertised on the forum) with an audience of 50 viewers. Not the way to do it. There has been a single blog like post since the EA Launch six weeks ago, talking about upcoming features. One. If you want information, you need to befriend moderators who are also close to the dev team, who will then feed you information that is generally kept secret so far - such as the very near economy wipe and the new economy system - e.g. Steel Sandwich on the official forum. I've received far more information that turned out to be true at this point from this hush hush source than I've received by following the developer announcement posts. Another issue is that it is marketed as a sandbox, when that also isn't correct. There is one way to advance: sink enemy ships. Other gameplay mechanics might be in place, but they do not advance your character whatsoever. Also, they're designed in a way that you can't do them as long as you want, as you will run out of a finite, non-replenishable resource and have to wait for it to grow back - as if this was Farmville, not a full price game. Admin is also completely mute on this subject, making many economy players wonder if this game is even for them, despite it clearly being marketed as a sandbox. This is not an Early Access game, this is basically a gofundme campaign where the developer asked for pre-purchases so he can keep developing the game that he wants. You're not paying to have your opinion heard about the game, you're not paying to help design it, you're paying to be an Alpha Tester for a game that is already finished on the whiteboard. I don't know whether that game will actually be good, because he's also pretty quiet on that subject. I do not believe this to be in the spirit of Early Access, therefore I am not recommending it.As to how that could change: Communication can't be a one way street. The developers need to actively engage the community. Information is key. Share your roadmap. We're left in the dark what's happening within the next four weeks at this point.			"

								When you first see the game it looks amazing.  That is the best feeling you will have about this game because it is downhill from there. The game lacks the contact to keep people playing.  When you try to bring it to the Devs attention on the forums you are treated badly.    Recently the public asked the Devs to fix a ship that was broken, the reply was that they would put up a kickstarter for more money and if the kickstarter when high enough they would fix it.			"

Early Access Review
								The short version.The game looks good during fights, but the UI is useless, the open world pointless, and progress impossible.This was once one of the single most promising games on Steam and now a year after launch is worse than I have ever seen it. Had it stopped develoment in the alpha arena test mode it would have been a far better game. The long versionOnce upon a time I purchased this game. Months later I got an alpha key to the testing phase where the game was an arena slug fest between the ships and you could slowly rank up and try more out to test the physics. Since then everything has gone downhill. My Yacht does not change that and neither did 3+ years of patience. At first it was a fairly solid game I would have been happy with. Honestly if they scrapped the open world or brought back the arena I would be happy. There is some sort of large pvp mode still in the game but after a year of open world trial I have yet to get it to work. The UI is almost entirely useless and is entirely confusing. Menus simply exist and action buttons trigger with no explination as to what they do. If you somehow manage to get into the open world expect an eternity of endless sailing with no sort of guidance what so ever until you are beaten to death or simply get bored. The open world itself is ambitious and stunningly large but it is 100% empty and you are reduced to watching a sprite of the boasted ship models lumber through waves like a lazy flash game. The game didnt even include a map for months. With transit times impossibly long and the rewards of travel limited to whatever you can scrape up from the miserable and primitive trade system there is no point to going outside of the ports.The highlight of the game is still combat. Where before the ships worked moderately well now they have complicated things with crew, officers, upgrades, and quality. Some of this is neat, other things simply add further confusion to the already abysmal UI. After more than a year the upgrades still display bugged. Officers skills do not work. Crew refuse to follow orders or suddenly abandon tasks. There is no feedback to anything you do and any sort of repair is guesswork. After loading into an admirality order combat mission today only one of my chaser weapons loaded, it took more than 20 minutes for it to finaly be useable. Speaking of weaponsm if you somehow manage to get a new ship good luck trying to figure out what type of gun to use on it. There is next to no way to tell without buying and equipping them.The visuals of this game are still lovely, within their context. The open world is an ugly mess, cities as far as ive seen look entirely the same. There is 0 customization that I am aware of. Crews stand on deck doing a single animation loop eternaly despite the condition of the ship or orders given. The ships themselves are gorgeous, but only in battle, out at sea they are significantly reduced sprites. Inside a port you cannot see anything but a name and a terrible unity basic UI.Sadly not recommended until significant changes have been made to the game. If I were you I would scrap the open world or put out the arena as a different game. I honestly just want to go back to brawling.			"

Early Access Review
								I have been playing this game on and off for over a year and a half now. I was in early access since before open world. The reason I can never recommend this game is because the developers keep constantly changing their plans for the game and development goals. It is very clear that they do not know what they are doing because they make changes and then do a complete 180 on those same changes six months later. As well, they do not warn players in advance that they will lose everything that they have worked for in this game. They have deleted / reset the game and the players accounts now at least 4 times. They are supposed to warn customers in advance of this. Instead, they only post a news section to current players and new players are completely blindsided that they will lose everything that they have worked for except now XP. But who knows when the developers will do a complete 180 on that decision as well.I can say after a year and a half of experience with this game that this game is NOT in development but instead only in experiment. They refer to customers as ""Play Testers"" instead of early access customers. This removes any obligation in their mind to you the ""Customer"" by thinking that you are some kind of unpaid volunteer and not a paying customer. In this regard they do not value customers at all, but instead treat them as pests and testers that need to be controlled and managed.Many of the stated plans and development ideas have changed completely since I gained access to the game. Right now, barely anyone plays on the server that I play on. you are lucky at the time of this writing to see 200 players online on the server that I play on during peak time. Usually, it is only less than 100 players. They have alienated anyone who speaks against their constant development / experiment floundering and feel no obligation whatsoever to actually progress the game towards a constant development track towards previous stated goals.I get the impression that this game is being made by a tiny group of people who are only getting paid to learn how to make games with no real intention whatsoever to actually create a full game. This game in my view will never be fully released because then the developers could be held accountable for what they do to their customers.Do not give these developers any more money. They need to be removed from steam. They are only experimenting and not actually continuing a solid track of game planned game development goals. Instead, they keep changing the targets and goals and doing 180's on previous plans and goals.			"

								One Word Unplayabale. The Griefer Crowd Finally Won the Devs over. And if you start the Game and leave the Port. You are often instantly Attacked right in sight of that Port. By 5-6 Enemies each Driving a Faster and Stronger Ship than you got.And not even allowing Allied Players to Help. And without even getting NPC Reinforcements to at least get some Support. Hence unless your going around with a PvP Ganking Group you can just as well not Play the Game "

								I have almost 1000h on this game and I greatly enjoyed it for the first few months and I gave a positive review of that game at that time despite it having many issues, but that's to be expected from an early access game.Sadly, I won't support Naval Action any further because of the path it's taking.The problem is that this game is currently making a very sharp turn towards realism while casting the gameplay and the fun aside. The devs don't seem to realize that while being beautiful, the age of sail was also plain boring and dull for a lot of sailors, and by making the game more ""realistic"" they are also making it boring.Currently, at least half of your time in this game will be spent traveling around to get where the fun is at instead of ""having fun"". Do you remember those moment at the amusement park where you're waiting in queue for an hour and a half just to be able to get on a ride for about 10 minutes ? That's how you'll feel while playing this game.Now the true question is, are those 10 minutes worth waiting for 1h30 ? I would have said yes a few weeks ago.But they are currently working on scraping the remaining bits of fun i had by trying to add more limitations in the name of ""realism"".It's to the point where I wonder why this game is called ""Naval ACTION"" instead of ""Age of sail manager 2016""			"

								The Age of Sail and the height of power for Ships of the Line...A beautiful game.  It sums it up simply.  The map is vast.  Days to sail across the Caribbean.  Combat is straight forward, and based purely on your skill as a captain.  But as was the way, harnessing the wind is key to victory.  Cannon fire is based on your aiming ability, and there are no ""skillsets"" persay that allow you to perform super power attacks.Based on the historical time period, with historically based and modeled ships, Naval Action is an MMO for the sea loving enthusiast.

								Having spent a lot of time on this game I cannot recommend it. The initial premise was good, the chosen direction was not.The response to criticism: censorship and bans. Now a year down the line, admins are trying to censor all negative comments to fish more sales from a dying game. A situation entirely of their own making. The things going on at the game labs forum are absolutely mindboggling. Don't let the early-access tag tempt you. This will be perpetual early-access to rationalize writing off or silencing any criticism. And while the last bits of the game die out the devs will still think they are doing the right thing. Absolutely cannot recommend.			"

								I found that Naval Action after much promise failed to deliver on my expectations.  The UI is my biggest complaint.  The openworld feels very much like a map and takes away from the feeling of sailing.  The battles are good, but after about ~50 hours I grew bored and progressing is a grind of traveling the open world.  The community is excellent.  The sounds and graphics of the battles are excellent, but I cant recoment this game based on my experience.  It's far too overpriced.			"

								My first review! I have roughly 100 hrs into this awesome gem of a SIM/RPG and I am completely satisifed with the resultsPROS-The ocean is magnificent! Storms, swells, waves and even the color of the ocean model is SO realisitc that it reminds me of home.-Open world sand box is AMAZING! You can get lost at sea, travel takes TIME and many of the island chains are WOW!-Combat is WAY kool! What can I say?! Cannons, realtime ship damage etc....CONS-Ports and ships are very generic, they all look the same.-Lacks immersion and little things that could really bring it to life like wildlife, people working on the piers and just being industrious, better ecomony and things for players to enegage in. Music, mini games like poker where we can loose or win ships and or resources, actual boarding game where we can see crew fighting on board etc....- Game gets boing after a bit since it is mostly combat and crafting ships, reminds me of EVE which I have close to 2000+ hours in.So I like what I see so far and I hope the Dev's will continue to polish this gem, I REALLY hope they do, because this has the potential to be phenominal! In fact, would be kool if Stranded Deep was teamed up with these folks to make loosing a ship VERY interesting!Game is still in Alpha and it is worth your time. money and support for this amazing game!

								I want to start off with something good, the community is absolutely amazing! Theyre helpfull, friendly and they organize events and activities! if not for the community this game would've been long dead.Graphics,The graphics look absolutely stunning, its a bit unoptimized, but it isnt that bad, I wouldnt reccomend this game if you have a bad PC tho cause you need a decent one to run it with like 30fps, I have a i7 6700k 16gb ddr4 and a R9 270x and the game runs good on medium, I need a GPU upgrade badly but I am having issues with OW sailing and large battles, small battles are fine (max 20 ships) it wont go below 60 fpsShips,There are a decent amount of ships in the game and they all feel diffrent and thats a good thing! I dont think theyre actually balanced but I dont mind that, it makes the game more fun tbh cause a gunboat can take out pretty much everything if you know how to play. They do looks absolutely amazing tho!I think these are the only positive things im affraid, Now the negative part...The playerbase,The playerbase is declining and this will not change UNLESS the price goes down atleast 30-50% I see so many posts that people want to give this a shot but its just too expensive, and I agree. A Early Acces game shouldn't be 40 euros or what ever price in whatever currency! Crew and animations,This is a more neutral thing cause the ship animation (sail/rudder/flags etc) are quite good, but the crew animation is horrible, they just sit there pulling and shoving the air and go trough your cannons, I mean its probably better to take it away all together until you have a decent animation, or let them atleast walk around your ship and make them dissapear when they get shot...I also have an issue with the ship crew feature, for the gunboat you need 40 people to fully crew it... what? its like a row boat with 2 cannons and a sail... you need maybe like 10 people MAX to fully crew it... if you get a big ship like a Santasima or a Victory or even a 3rd rate I can understand you need 700+ crew but for like 7/6/5 you dont need more then like 100... Crew is also very expensive if you just start out.. its 500 gold per crew member and you start out with like 40, if you get sunk once and lose all youre crew that means you need to pay 20k gold, have fun with that in youre basic cutter trying to make some gold...No tutorial,This game doesnt have a tutorial, and before you start commenting ""players will help you"" listen, The fact that the devs didnt bother with a tutorial mind boggles me, This game isnt easy to get a hang off, they dont show you how to sail, they dont explain the UI, they dont explain how to shoot, they dont explain how to make money/xp they dont explain SH*T, and yes the community will gladly help you, they will show you the ropes but a tutorial is needed, tips are needed, there HAS to be a crafting tutorial, a manual sail tutorial, a shooting tutorial a trading tutorial, you cant expect the community to help you if you're too lazy to actually help US.The UI,Oh noi does it look like its made in MS paint, I think it never actually changed over the time I owned this game and I own it for a while now, I get that the Devs are ""busy"" But for the love of god change the god awfull amateur looking UI...Open World,Open World at this point is just sailing to orders or to get some stuff in another city and get ganked, its bland, its boring, the wind is the worst feature in OW aswell cause youre always sailing against it. Please add more stuff to do in open world... we got fishing but it only gives you a reason to go out of port to get a tiny chance of finding a bottle... Also I understand you want us to sail to out missions etc but if it takes you ~10 min to get there AND youre sailing against wind which will make it 15-20min then it gets real boring real quik... give us stuff to look at, give us something to do! please redesign or take away the wind feature in OW all together!EDIT: They added in forts and towers, I think they kinda changed OW overall cause it looks ""better"" I guess, they also updated the map, which looks a little better then the old one so thats nice I guess.Missions/orders/whatever you wanna call them,The missions are fun, well for the first 2 levels cause after that it takes longer to get to them and the battles take for ♥♥♥♥ing ever... You can make money and XP by doing PvP but other than missions you cant, and it wouldnt be an issue if the mission only took about 10-15 min but it takes like half an hour and sometimes even 45min, for a PvP battle thats fine! but unless its a special event or dungeon kinda thing PvE shouldnt last longer than 15min...EDIT: They updated the missions, now there are delivery missions (trading) Battle missions (same as the old once) and something with war and giving stuff not sure what it is since there is basically no description. Also you cant do missions from your captial! so now you actually have to sail even further to get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you and make jack♥♥♥♥♥♥Crafting,I cant say allot about this because I didnt bother starting this yet, maybe someone else could explain in detail whats good/wrong with it. EDIT: still pretty much the same but harderTo be honest there is allot more but I've been writing this post for like 20min already...Please leave a comment if you think I am wrong but I think the Developers are just lazy, I heard they have a small team but they can always hire more people, also the game doesnt seem to move forward and I wont see allot of positive change unless the developers start doing something about it... I also heard that there are allot of people that wanted to help out with allot of these problems but the devs turned them down for what ever reason. I dont know if all of this is true but I saw it in the game chat and on the forums a couple of times so yeah just wanted to throw that out.			"

								To make this post short, I have been playing this game for over a year off and on because the game HAD great potential in the beginning. I have been a member of multiple clans in game and have played on both PVP servers. I switched clans only because most of my clanmates quit out of frustration. The Devs do NOT listen to comments or care for suggestions. The fourms has and continues to be a shamble argument between players and admins. I had hoped that after taking a brief break from the game, new updates would change this... that being said, after reading the latest fourm posts, I have decided that the game will probably sit in my steam account unplayed. In te beginning, the server population was large enough to make an enjoyable evening of fighting. That being said, the last time i played, it was a chore to attempt to find PVP, and it became impossible to get into any Port Battles, which is the main aim in the game. I quit some months ago now after a year and would strongly atmit that i would not buy this game in its current state given what i know now.			"

								Man did this game have so much potential!! Ive never been so excited to play a game when i started playing this, ended up in a clan and become a trader, spent hours sailing round from port to port looking for the best deals or anything my clan needed for crafting. They would come back me up if anyone tried to capture me. Was great fun, but then life got in the way so to speak, was away from the game for awhile. Every now and then i would log back in a slowly i started noticing the clan i played with stopped playing the game too. Now no one plays it, since then ive had issues loading the game, trying to chat in the game, it freezing while im sailing.... seems to be issue after issue which maybe why the numbers of online players are so low... Im still hopeful the DEV team can turn this game around as would love to see it all running smoothly and everyone getting back on board. As of right now i wouldnt recommend buying the game, which is ashame as i was speaking to a friend who wanted to play along with me but now im going to suggest to him to wait and i will keep a eye on how it develops.

								Someone still remembering the age-old title Age of Sail? I loved that title for it's atmosphere and approach to realistic sailing and shooting mechanics.In many aspects, Naval Action seems to be a worthy successor.Ship handling is difficult and demanding, but incredibly rewarding when you finally get the hang on it (I certainly have no arrived at that point. Still missing broadsides at point blank.) It feels very immersive, too.Now add a pinch of Pirates! to the lot and mix it with classical MMO features:Naval action circles around PvE and PvP (there is a PvE only server, too) sea battles in an open world sandbox (yes, that time of the year again). Choose a faction to side with and gain ranks and riches by doing missions, privateering, trading and, well: naval action. Grind your rank from petty midshipman all the way up to rear admiral while sailing the infamous caribbean waters.Be aware there is only a very, very basic and GODDAMMN ugly, but functional UI and port interface present at the moment (place holder)!The AI is decent but not stunningly smart. It benefits from cheating and bonuses, too. Still lots of room for improvement here.As to be expected you can find balancing issues, bugs and glitches but so far I did not discover a game-braking one. Remember: Early Access.If you were disappointed by gamey ship handling in Empire: Total War but loved it's graphics and atmosphere, Naval Action will interest you. If you're willing to look beyond the Early Access issue and the heavy Elite:Dangerous style rank grind, which still feels dull and pretty unrewarding.If you ever wanted to be Jack Aubrey, Mr. Hornblower, Arr! Blackbeard or Surcouf, this is your chance. Don't forget to have a looped volley of shanties running on your music player, though.The Looks and SoundsSailing ships roll and pitch in the seas in all their detailed, glorious splendour. Mighty Ship-of-the-Lines exchanging rolling broadsides under a waning moon, their dim stern lanterns lit while the whole sea is enlightened by muzzle flahes just to be swallowed by dense gun powder clouds again.Listening to the creaking sound of ships rolling in heavy waves and the impressive thunder of firing 32 pounders is impressive.Ah, the ocean! It's colour sheme and rolling wave's look even more realistic and impressive than in World of Warships, and that ocean already looks stunning.Spotting a lone sail or traces of a slowly growing landmass on the fog-shaded horizon amidst the sheer endless, foaming sea really succeeded in immersing me right into the game.I've exclusively playing PvE until now- so I can't give a verdict about the PvP servers or the state of PvP in general.As of update 9.7 there have been many additions to PvE content like gargantuan AI fleets, AI can sail all ship types, a stronger, very challenging AI opponent (as of update 9.73 made easier for lower skill levels), land-in battles (meaning the battle terrain will reflect the open world terrain).The only thing that needs to be added for atmosphere are decent music (and by the way, those STUPID COMMENTS ON THE LOADING SCREENS NEED TO GO! They are not even close to be funny.) and more modelled sailors. Right now you've only got one sailor manning a gun each, the helm is unmanned and no one cares to deal with sails. Which looks kinda silly! Albeit the sailors models themselves are well done and the textures detailed.On CraftingBuilding ships can be a pain. It all comes down to the hunt for blue prints enabling you to buildship type when consuming the blue print item.Blue prints do have a random drop chance while producing a certain ship type:e.g. building a St. Pavel 2nd Rate Ship-of-the-Line might give you a blue print drop for a 1st rate Victory.As chance RNG is involved you may have to build several ships of a type to cimb up the blue print ladder. This can be frustrating. But as of patch 9.6 the chances for drops have been altered so there is a very decent drop chance by now. I have all the blueprints by now and don't even have the highest crafting rank- chances are influenced by your level relative to the BP level you are trying to get and the quality of the shiup you were building- the higher the better)Crafting is also affected by your crafting XP level. You get XP for building ships, modules, components and thus level up until you reach level 50 enabling you to build the mightiest 1st rates in exceptional quality and the best modules (that can be placed as ship components making them better), too.Crafting also requires ressources (surprise, isn't it? :P), which are consumed by producing ship parts. These parts are then used in the building process. Eg. Oak---> X planks--->X planks needed to build ship Y.For the very crafting process you also consume labour hours that replenish over time. As they are also used for extracting ressources from production buildings, buildiong modules or components they are the rarest good. You'll have to be careful on what to spend them if you want to climb the XP ladder / built ships most effective. E.g. you'll have to amass the labour hours worth of two real life days to build a single Santissima Trinidad- without all the components needed!			"

								Set in the Age of Sail you will captain your ship through the entire Caribbean in search of either the riches of the land or the blood of the enemy. You are able to rank up to command some of the biggest ships out there, like the 1st Rate HMS Victory, or build up your trading and crafting endeavours and rake in the big money.There are a whole bunch of nations to choose from (United States, Denmark/Norway, Sweden, British Empire, France, Dutch Republic of the United Provinces, Spain and the outlaw Pirates), ranging in various difficulties depending on how many islands they start out with and their diplomatic capabilities. You can log onto a server (PvP or Player versus Player) where many of the ports can be conquered by other players of other nations and players of the different nations can fight it out in the Caribbean waters with each other as well, or you can choose to take it easy and sail around on the PvE (Player versus Environment) server where those things are disabled. Rank progression is shared among the two, money and assets aren't.Even at this early stage the tropical world you sail in looks gorgeous and the action when battling looks breathtaking. That being said, it's not a game for the people that are impatient and with a short attention span. If you intend on exploring the Caribbean you can easily spend 30 to 60 minutes sailing without anything in sight but open sea before reaching land again. But it's worth picking up for those who played Empire: Total War for the ships and possibly familiar with Pirates of the Burning Sea.[21/01/2016 Early Access Launch]Mind you that this is a very early alpha build. There's no tutorial yet, neither any pointers, hints or tips, and UI is minimal yet functional and not all planned features are in the game yet. For the best experience it is recommended to find like-minded players through chat, on the forums or better yet join them on TeamSpeak. Many of the seasoned players, many who were able to play for more than a year, are more than happy to help answering all of your questions. If you want to play this rather for yourself on the PvE server, expect a steep learning curve.			"

								I've been playing this the last couple of days and I really enjoy it. I've been doing a lot of trading as well as fighting and both are great fun. I really like the lack of minimap or any indication of your whereabouts so you have to navigate the hard way. The combat is very fun and skill based, no tab target or homing shots, only manually aimed cannons with the shot arcing so you have to aim up. It is also open world PvP where anyone other then your own nation can attack you at any time.For a game that has just released as Early Access on Steam it is amazing!			"

								One night I got jumped by several members of a nation we were at war with, all in ships that out classed mine.  I tried to flee, but they chained my sails an ultimately sank me.  I'd like to think I got a few licks in though.  I re-spawned to find they were also attacking a port nearby where I had an outpost, so now, with only the ""basic cutter"", I sneaked back into the port where my outpost was, loaded up a trading vessel with all of my crafted items and resources (more than enough to make another ship!) and sneaked out.  My enemies caught up with me but I was able to flee the battle in my trader and get back to my nation's capital with my treasures.  It was a heart pounding hour or more of play, even though I was on the losing side of the one fight.  Now I'm out in a bigger better ship looking for some revenge.I've never really played more than a few minutes of an MMO before, and I was intrigued by this game's theme of Age of Sail combat.  I've been drawn in by the player-vs-player politics and fighting.  The battles are wonderfully rendered and the thunder of cannons, haze of smoke, and thrill of victory really bring the Age of Sail alive.			"

								Cheater's game.Just check the Tribunal forum http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/forum/37-tribunalPeople are buying multiple accounts to create crossteam alts to disrupt the RVR game. I'll explain the mechanics:Only one attack on an enemy port is possible per day. These cheaters use their alt accounts to  initiate this attack, then they don't carry it out, protecting the port for an entire day from being attacked. They repeat this every day. The admins do nothing about this, because crossteaming is only forbidden if you troll the chat channels of your enemy. This issue has first been come up in _February_ and nothing was done about it. Now it's a daily occurence. This is of course not the only abuse of crossteaming alts, but by far the most severe one. And it's all legal. This game is a safe haven for cheaters, assuming they're going the ""buy extra account"" way of cheating.			"

								I started playing Naval Action about a year ago. When I bought it, you could only play something called Sea Trails, which was only combat and no open world. I got a bit tired of the wipes, so I didn't play that much. That didn’t mean I disliked it, though. Naval Action does in fact beat all the games I've played about warships from the age of sail. I think it beats Assassin's Creed: Black Flag and Pirates of the Caribbean Online by a long shot, even though I played the crap out of them. That was true even a year ago, when the ship vs. ship action wasn't as good as it is now and there was no open world. The visuals are amazing, too. Stern lights and the day and night cycle gives a really good atmosphere. When in combat, the muzzle flashes of cannons going off as well as the gunpowder smoke looks better than in any other similar game. I have most graphic options on the lowest, but the game still looks amazing. Naval Action already have a lot of different vessels ranging from fast 8 cannon sail ships to giant first rate ships of the line with up to 138 cannons and three gun decks (four if you include the weather deck). If you have played World of Warships, you will recognize certain elements when it comes to shooting. For instance, you can shoot individual shots to make sure the full broadside will hit. It is, however, more difficult and in my opinion better than in WoWs. Wind is an important aspect in NA, as all ships are using sails. Tacking against the wind can be hard for newcomers, but there are good tutorials out there that cover this. Open world is something I haven’t really played that much, but I do like it. You can choose between the British, French, Spanish, Swedish, Danish-Norwegian, Dutch, United States navies as well as Pirates. You become a Pirate automatically when attacking ships from your own navy. The whole crafting and trading system may seem a little overwhelming to some, but it is something that should be learnt quite easily. Off course, there are tutorials for that too. Ships can be crafted, and players can set ships for sale at a price they choose themselves. You can, for example, sell a cutter (The first ship you get) for 100.000 gold, but nobody will buy it as they can get it for free in the store. Also, each ship have 5 durability, which means that if it sinks 5 times it is gone forever. You can buy repair kits, but in combat you can only use one. That means that you will often find yourself running away if you’ve ended up in a bad situation.  Apart from from the placeholder UI, the only thing I dislike about the game is that after you buy it, there’s no way to continue supporting it through the game itself. The game is not for people who are just looking for a relaxed and forgiving MMO experience, but if you're interested in warship games I can almost guarantee that you'll like it. There is more to this game than just what I've mentioned, and I might add to this review when I've played some more.10/10			"

								Hi,I've got a ton of hours playing this game for over a year in closed alpha.  I can tell you the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is really fun, the community is great, and this game really fills the huge empty gap that is currently missing for Open World Age of Sail games.The OW is huge and It takes probably 20+ hours to sail across the Carribean in this game.  There is trading, crafting, ship building, port battles, storms, varying weather, day night cycle, several factions and free towns, realistic phyics, historical ships, large fleet battles, conquest mechanics...pretty much everything you would want in a realistic Age of Sail game.  For the combat, this game is more on the realism and hardcore, skill based side, easy to pick up hard to master, having to learn things like yard controls with tacking and boxhauling maneuvers.Please note the devs have been rapidly releasing new features and there is not a lot of what I would call 'polish' to the game yet.  The UI is pretty barebones and some gameplay is not yet fully fleshed out.  The good news is their servers have been rock solid so far, no disconnects or anything.If you are an avid PvPer you will love this game.  If you love large battles you will love this game.  Hell even if you only want PvE they got that covered too.  Buy this game as their won't see many like it in this genre.  Definitely a PotBS killer. "

								I've owned this game for nearly a year now, and since then, the game has improved dramatically. When I first started there was no open world, only a battle arena. This was fantastic because it allowed the developers to test combat mechanics. Since then, they've implimented the Open World, basic economy and crafting, a new damage model, and a ton of new ships.The game is fairly niche, and it does have a steep learning curve when it comes to combat, but don't let that hold you back. The graphics are incredible, the sound effects are stunning, and the ships are majectic. The developers have been fantastic thus far; they have been very open to change and discussion, as well as listening to the opinions and suggestions of members of the community.Naval Action has been absolutely fantastic, and I have nothing but kind words to say about it. Now remember, it is an Early Access game, so there are bugs, and there are things that aren't as pretty or refined as they could be. There isn't an ""Official"" tutorial, but there are many fan made ones here: http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/forum/44-guides/  However, at the end of the day, I'd have to reccomend this game. The developers had put this release off for several months, because they wanted to make a good first impression. That alone, speaks a lot for the character of the developers. They're not in it for the early cash grab, but instead, they are devoted to making an incredible game.			"

								The first time I saw my cannon balls bounce off an opponent's hull, I knew I was hooked on Naval Action.Naval Action is an Age of Sail naval combat simulator wrapped in an open world MMO. The game is really centered around, and shines as, a combat simulator that requires true skill, strategic thinking, and sound tactics to be successful. Combat is not a twitch fest and really only a small to moderate amount of manual dexterity and precision is required. However with wind, ship, and munition physics well modeled it's a thinking man's game where patience, planning, and a solid understanding of what works and doesn't work is super helpful.The devs have done a brilliant job of laying out a long career path for captains in the game as you start with the smallest Cutter and work your way up. Each successive upgrade helps you develop your skills and become more proficient as a captain without dumping you off the deep end. PvP is amazing and a variety of scenarios are available from dueling, attacking traders, port battles, fleet missions, and individual missions. For those who are adverse to PvP a PvE only server is available that offers a solid player experience without the stress and unpredictability of the PvP environment.On top of all this, the game has a solid economy, trading, crafting, ship building, and most recently inter-nation alliances. The devs are continually improving the game, adding perks, features and new twists while striking a really good balance between being responsive to their player base and keeping the game playable and accessible to all.Another selling point for Naval Action is the community. The community within Naval Action is one of the most welcoming and helpful I have encountered. Most everyone is willing to answer questions from new players and help them out. Many more senior players will keep a low level ship or two in their inventory just so they can sail on missions with newer players, help them learn, and level up.Overall Naval Action is an excellent game that continues to improve over time and is well worth your time if you are interested in the genre.

								There are many people who are giving this game a negative review while logging hundreds of hours in the game.  If this is the case, then they obviously got their money’s worth out of this game.  The development team is small, and it can take a while for the developers to address issues with the game.  If there is something that is bothering you, post it on the forums and if it is game breaking for you, just put the game down for a while.This is an early access game and you should expect changes both good and bad.  Development of a game like this takes time and people seem to want instant gratification.  I have seen the developers make drastic changes that angered the community, and the developers have always been quick to reverse these changes or fix them by another means.  The developers have been addressing people’s issues of things like ganking, which was one of my major criticism of this game, and I feel like they have done a great job of fixing this issue with new rules of engagement.  The developers have also added fleets and port defenses to help protect players in their home waters.  No more ganking players right outside of friendly capitals.  This is a niche game that is not for everyone.  The developers strive for as much realism as is possible in a video game which means, combat can take a long time and sailing from place to place can take a long time.  The developers have put a hard cap of 1 hour 30 minutes on each combat instance, and many of my combats have taken the full 1 hour and 30 minutes to complete.  Do not expect to log into this game and jump right into the action like world of warships.  This game is more dynamic and requires you to sail to where the action is.  The developers of this game have built an age of sail naval combat game with a vast open world to explore.  This is a sandbox game, and will require you to make your own fun.  This game can be as boring as you want it to be, or as fun as you want it to be.  There is almost always something to do, just ask nation chat or pick up a trading mission or combat mission.  Sailing from place to place can be time consuming, finding other players to fight can be time consuming, sailing from port to port is time consuming.  It can take hours to sail from one place to another.  This is how unbelievably vast the game world is, and I feel like some people take this for granted, but in reality, it’s quite amazing.  The developers built a mini world and you can sail anywhere you want, although if you are in enemy waters, you may get attacked by other players.  Traveling time in this vast open world has been mitigated with the addition of outpost slots, also, you can easily teleport your ship from port to port by capturing a NPC ship and you only need to make the trip in open world once.  This is not an instant gratification game.  If you want to be sailing a 1st rate ship of the line, it will take you a long time to achieve this goal.  You will need to gain ranks, you will need to gain money, and you will either have to buy a 1st rate ship of the line from another player or join a clan that will build you one once you can fully crew the ship, or build one yourself.  Accumulating the recourse to build ships is time consuming, but achieving this goal feels very meaningful once accomplished.  This game is not a newb friendly game.  Learning how to do things in this game is time consuming and will take you hours of practice to master.  If you are not willing to put in the time and effort to learn this game, and watch youtube tutorials on how to effectively use your ship, than this game is not for you.  Happy Sailing!			"

Also run in fleets to take ports from others and gank players that never saw us coming!  but lets talk about the pros and cons.Pros--------1)Game has many ways to play it(Trade,Fight,Steal,Build)2)Very immersive(while in battle things are very realistic)3)Active devs looking to better there game taking all criticism and suggestions and really trying to make the game we all want to play.Cons-------1)Price(yes its expensive. I do feel i got my moneys worth and then some though)2)No Tutorial(you will find yourself on youtube and in the chat asking for help ALOT)3)The UI (its ugly but a placeholder)Essentially its up to what kinda games you like to play. Did you enjoy Elite Dangerous? You will likely enjoy this game. There will be a steeeeeeeep learning curve but after you get a feel for the controls you will be Tacking into the wind and firing beautiful broadsides in no time.			"

								Hours ingame are not properly represented on Steam. I played ~5,5 hoursThis game, and especially it's developers, are a huge unproffesional mess. Initially the game has no tutorial; making it very difficult to find your way around the poorly designed user interface until you find the button to instantly fight battles. From that point onwards it becomes lobbying for quickmatches. Sadly this kindof defies the premise of a ""open world naval simulation"" to me.With an average of ~130 or so players online split over 3 or so servers, and nobody lending a hand to new players, the game simply turns into a rather boring pvp grind that repeats itself time after time. I've never played a game that managed to lose grip of my interest this fast. Despite looking fantasticly detailed visually, there's really nothing below the surface of the oceans besides tedious ever repeating tasks.In addition the developers are more than but questionable, legitemately trying to confront players and calling negative feedback ""half empty pessimists""; which is echoed over several more reviews. Then there's the roadmap, which doesn't speak of any changes to the current model - meaning it'll only be enjoyable to those willing to put thousands of hours of work(emphasizing work) in obtaining a new virtual item.Unless you're an absolute hardcore naval fanatic willing to repeat the same bland tasks into eternity avoid this game. Might've recommended provided it was 5$, but it's an extremely hefty 38$.3/10			"

								Concept is good but wont really work, too many nations with a low player base and no way to balance the population will lead to 1-2 weaker nations that will always be be underdogs. Which may lead to players leaving nation, enjoying a 1 port nation or even leaving the game.10-15min to just get to an mission and then 30min-1hr battles(no way to take a break) then 10-15min sail back... This isnt a game for people that have much in their life going, so you really need to spend alot on ya butt just watching the ocean and sails.Untested patches, they do things to the game that can ruin it. Latest patch land ahoy made alot of people leaving the game(either taking a break or just abandoning it). Even tho they say were testing, but tests can break said playtime since everything takes alot of time.I find even EvE online more manageable in playtime than this game.ATM i cant recommend this game, it looks pretty but the dead time is too much compared to any other game ive played.Will edit if anything changes but now im leaving the game until i see some changes.Edit: to add the price is waaaay off, really not worth it when you can get much better for that high price.

								I loved the sailing in AC4; it's the main reason I picked this game up because it took that aspect that I loved and built upon it. You spawn in your little dinghy at a port full of a bunch of other people in their little dinghies and one guy with a giant♥♥♥♥♥frigate showing off. This game doesn't have much curb appeal. You step in and it's clearly unpolished (as expected). The UI is bad and confusing, boarding ships is this minigame that people have described as ""rock paper scissors"" but really if you just always go offense you can't seem to lose, there are no tutorials or help in-game, and many items/descriptions are ambiguous like ""Marines"" give me ""cannon_reload_time = 10%."" What does that mean? Is my reload time going up or down? Or is it 10% of the original value? I also didn't figure out different wood types affect ship speed/health until about 15 hours in. That would be important. Also I didn't know that your rank affected how many crew you can have, not which ship you can buy. Would've been nice before buying a 200 crew ship so early on. I have encountered a few bugs, namely capturing ships and then not receiving them in the loot screen.Still, despite all these flaws, it is a damn fun game. Now that I've figured out how most of the mechanics work, there is a lot of depth to the overworld content as well as combat. The roar of cannons in the big 20+ ship battles is music to my ears, not to mention the game looking really good for an EA title. Also, the lag seems to be non-existant. I play on the EU PvP server since it's the most populated and don't notice any lag at 150ms nor have I seen anyone rubber-banding and such. Finally, the devs appear to be very responsive. They're active on Twitter answering questions and posting about updates as well as being very reactive to player feedback before the Steam launch went live. All in all I give it a 8/10. The core mechanics are good fun and there's definitely enough content to keep you occupied. The devs have a solid base that's rough around the edges; once you get past the initial ""wtf is this"" from the UI and confusion, the game is really fun. Am I sure this game will move in the right direction? No. But from what I've seen the devs have a good head on their shoulders. Still, it's an EA title so take that with a grain of salt.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is amazing. For me, it is the fufillment of a childhood dream; to be a captian on the high seas, sailing the ships that I constantly drew and studied as a child. This effect was tripled when the Devs added the wonderful USS Essex into the game; I've been drawing that ship since I was in 1st grade. Thanks devs, for helping me fufill a long-thought dream.I'll plainly lay out pros/cons for your convenience, dear reader.+The game's open world is amazing! The map is massive, filled with beautiful islands and ports- and enemies too. It's breathakingly beautiful.+Ship models are mind-blowing not only in beauty, but accuracy.  You're not sailing a digital representation in low def; you're sailing an exact recreation of the real thing. Perhaps not as ""rugged"" as people imagine, but beautiful nevertheless.+Ship performance and customization systems are extremley detailed and advanced! Characteristics of a ship range heavily from turn rate, speed and even the thickness of your hull- much more involved. A pantheon of upgrades allows you to customize your own ship to fit your play style, which is incredible.+Combat system is divine. The game's entire purpose is first as an age of sail combat simulator, and they nailed it here. Ships perform accuratley as they would in real life; spare for a 25% speed boost from the real thing. Perform complex manuavers like tacking, box hauling, etc, outsmart your enemy in so many ways. +Ballistics engine is mind-blowing. There's no ""hp bar""; shots can penetrate through hull, create splinters that could kill some crew standing by a gun, bounce around the other side of the hull (or exit), carry away some unfortunate fellow, ricochet off a gun, etc. It's, in my opinion, the most wickedly advanced ballsitics and damage engine that the industry has seen next to qualitiy titles like War Thunder. +Crafting! A grindy process that really pays off, crafting allows you to custom build your ships and other materials. Gather materials, build the ship like they would in the real days by whipping up things ranging from the hull frames, knees for deck support and even the ship's stern furnishings if she has them. I do emphasise grindy; however, it really pays off in the end; very, very satisfying to craft your ""dream ship"" yourself!+Officers! It's a new update which is really awesome. You can hire officers that join you on your missions and gain ""perks"" and other skills to help you manage your ship. There's a really hillarious ""coward"" perk that reduces the battle exit timer by 50% for example. I think it's a cool little addon that allows one to say ""we beat them through superior gunnery"". :)Now, the game isn't perfect. Though I love the game, it has a few things to hammer out!-National diplomacy system isn't perfect. The Devs have very wisely been receptive to the community for demands to reform the system in various ways. Pirate mechanics are unusual; as the pirates are manifested as a nation with extra perks to that of the other nations, and hence they have an actual empire, government, ect which is fairly unusual. Declaring war, making treaties are managed by the larger clans, which can be viewed as not too representative of the nation's majority views.-UI is minimalistic; it's not hideous, but it isn't exactly attractive either. It could be better, but the devs have prioritized (and quite simply, rightly so) the game mechanics over the UI. Hope you're not too picky over game UI!-Grindy. Personally, I find Naval Action's ships, ranging from the starter cutter to the largest ship of the line infinitley playable, and hence I really didn't mind the ""grind"", if you will to get to the higher levels for manning ships. However, if yo're impatient, this game may be a bit slow for you. Grind process is longer than most games!-Learning curve is long! The game's mechanics are complex, so beware those with a low attention span, heh. The Community as a whole is wonderful in being very helpful to new players, but there's no in-game tutorial or official help guides to get you off your feet. It certainly took  me a while to master the art of ""manual sailing"" in the square rigged ships.I'm not sure why the game's been getting mixed reviews as of late. The game is, at its core, a sandbox age of sail combat simulator; not a fast and boring free to play like World of Warplanes, etc. The game is designed to create a beautiful and immersive enviroment to engage in combat and screw around in the open world first and foremost; the devs here didn't design the game to advance fast, or the goal of the game to get to the ""top level"". AS a combat simulator, the game excells beyond any doubt. Anyone who analyzes the game from my perspective will agree wtih me. However, those who analyze the game from those whose interpretation of the nature of the game is to level up and win as quickly as they can will look on the game poorly. Please keep that in mind when looking at other reviews that attack the grinding of the game and ""ganking"" mechanics.Edit: July 30th, 2016I've also noticed a lot of criticism against the devs apparently not ""adding much to the game"". In a mere month, they've done the following:-Added Fishing, hence expanding the economy, adding new roles to trader ships and yet another way to play Naval Action.-Added Food Rations and other supplies to represent need for resources to mantain crew.-Crew is now a resource. Losing 50 men to a close range rake now has much more effect on your well being.-Added officers, a very significant addition to the game.-Added treasure hunting for some exploration fun.-Added some new upgrades.-Added the wonderful 2nd rate ship of the line Bucenature.-Showcased the Santa Cecilia, a new frigate in the game.Look at the patch notes for the month, and tell me again that the devs aren't adding much to the game...

The economy and trade is basically nonexistant... its a lobby pvp game with a real pretty lobby (the ""open"" world).

								A fantastic sailing sim set in the 1800's. Get lost in both the immersive world and at sea because you don't remember where that mission was!This game offers a lot despite it's Early Access status. You can:1. Sail around the Southern US, Carribbean, parts of South America, and more.2. Join the world renowned navies of the 1800's, such as the British, French, Spanish, Pirates and more.3. Join PvP or PvE servers depending on your preferences.4. Get lost at sea for half a month and hope that you'll find some sort of land.5. Trade between many different cities and ports, and be chased mercilessly by pirates.Overall, it's a fantastic game with great mechanics and physics. It's very easy to sink some time into.			"

								First off, the graphics in this game are fantastic as is the combat engine.  I love the ship to ship combat and the feel of sailing these vessels.  I have put many hours into this game and I have made many friends as I have with most mmo's.Naval Action may still  be in early(late )development but I am still going to give it a negative review.   The last consecutive patches have changed this from an incredibly fun and captivating game, into a boring waste of time.  This has led to an increasing decline in the server  popluations which consequently makes the game even more boring.  The developers seem to lack direction or a unified vision and this can be seen in radical shifts in the changes they have attempted with regards to both PvP and crafting in the latest patches.  You are left unsure of whether they intend this to be a game or a simulator.  Feedback from the players(testers) is often discouraged unless it's positive.Unless there is a major change in the development of this game, I predict it will end up in the boneyard of games that had promise but failed.  I would not recommend buying this game until it has made it to its official final release and has had some success.			"

								THE only realistic, engrossing, enthralling ship combat game straddling the Napoleonic era.  Worth the price for the combat alone, but plenty of other player-driven content to occupy your time - crafting, trading, exploring.Not for the twitchy, impatient gamer.  But even if you don't like the crafting side, you can do missions, earn plenty of Gold to buy a ship that suits your new rank...And it's fun to be along for the ride with a small but attentive development team that cares about making a game that is faithful to the era, to history.  Expect changes often to the game in patches, and have fun!			"

								I come from playing tons of the old Pirates of the Carribean community mod and tons of hours in Pirates of the Burning Sea. Naval action really brings back memories of the hay day of POTBS.The game currently is not complete but the core gameplay is solid. Ship to ship combat is amazing, not too hard to get into but very hard to master. The feel in this game is great, really lets you get immersed into it.There is currently a progression system implemented that as you do PVE missions you gain ranks within your chosen navy. You can however sail any ship you like, what limits you however is the higher rank you are the more sailors you can hire. I really love the way this inserts progression in an unobtrusive way whilst keeping the theme.The graphics are pretty solid right now with improvements on performance coming with updates all the time. It currently runs pretty well on medium and up spec systems.The only real criticism currently is that there is no tutorial currently you are just dropped into the open world. If you buy this game head over to YouTube and look up some guides otherwise you will be kinda lost.			"

								As of 1/26/2016, understand that what you're buying into is a very Alpha-build game. Most of the menus and port screens arent built up with graphics (Literally just a solid blue background with solid navy blue buttons for selections). The leveling progression is very ""figure this♥♥♥♥♥♥out on your own"". Socialisation is difficult with a crowded little chat window that has multiple channels that will probably go ignored by most players. The game almost feels like a simplified version of EvE online.And it's downright amazing.It's just a beautifully crafted game with loads of potential.I'd recommend you pick it up today!			"

								Naval Action has supprised me. Although still early in it's development, the game provides an immersive experiance that replicates the neccessity of quick thinking and adaptation to circumstance that pervades naval combat. The ocean is a 'living' being adding chaos to even the most well thought out and well timed turn to broadside the enemy. This chaos complements the commitment combat entails. This is not another simple a random number generator, HP driven fight with boats. This is more a physical recreation of a universe with accurately modelled physics. Combat is not resolved in seconds, nor even minutes. My first duel in the game lasted roughly 15 minutes, on the edge of my seat, hoping for some turn of advantage that would yield me the weather gage (naval advantage) and allow me to force victory.If you want a deeper naval warfare simulation then get this. If you want another arcade game that yields you easily exploited mechanics and detracts from the naval history of the Age of sail, look elsewhere.			"

This game is quite expensive for Alpha game but I’m must say I love this type of game that have realistic feel of combat which requires actual aiming not just click with a mouse button proper aiming, distance, and yes sea waves actually blocking cannon balls when sailing this is truly awesome never seen anything like it! Since only 6 people working on this game I hope they hire more people so hopefully now they should have some sort of budget due to price.

								Somehow it all works.. perfectly.A naval simulation that brings the adventures of Horatio Hornblower to life..There is more than meets the eye on this one and it sure looks stunning with great immersive sounds to make naval battles feel like your actually at the helm shouting orders to your crew.. battles are thrilling and exiting and can last quite awhile.. one can join missions and jump into small or big battles or enter the open world map where you can sail the high seas, trade, fight and or get lost ehm i mean explore the vast map.  Everything seems to come together and you can find yourself fending of pirate ships or a french raider, chasing down a dutch trade ship in the hope to capture its cargo and or even the ship itself, everything is possible and the game mechanics they've created just work very well.  If this is a pre-alpha game it blows some premium games right out of the water and it will only get better. Sofar still discovering things after a day or two with this title and having a great adventure on the high seas!This game is easy to get into and would be a blast to play with friends.. its a great naval simulation that shouldn't been missed..after few more hours in the game i have discovered that:Battles can last up to 30+minutes with intense action and lots of smoke where you can almost smell the gunpowder! Battles are more rewarding and fun if you team up and in port you can divide the spoils of war, it also allows you to attack bigger ships off the line when you have greater numbers.for guide hints and tips or even what it is, check out youtube..

								First, this game is not for everyone. Its a niche game. You will not be given a story, you must make your own. This is a sandbox PvP game (also PvE but I don't reccomend that). There may be a huge enemy player fleet around that island even in your home waters waiting to sink you, or there may be nothing. Some people complain about the ""grind"" but honestly within a week you can fully crew some excellent ships that are very important and effective in PvP (like the Rattlesnake). This is a slow paced game where you can easily take on a group of more ships in bigger ships if you have the skill. There are upgrades etc.. that help, but at the end of the day one missed broadside, or a badly timed maneuver negates the positive effect of most of them. The combat mechanis are very detailed, with tons of room to micro manage all the while you must manually aim every shot. Sometimes this means a whole broadside into a wave, sometimes it means enough hits below the waterline (leaks) to sink a ship with otherwise full HP. I'll add to this review later, but long story short if you are into this sort of game there is nothing else like it, but again its not for everyone.... which is where the best games come from. The learning curve is steel, but the reward is great. Just get into your nations TS or group up with a clan and more then likely they will be very supporting (at least thats what its like in Sweden).			"

								Naval Action is a gorgeous game with a lot of potential, some of it front and center and already realised. The game is an interesting mix of gameplay styles. The ship to ship combat is streamlined but deep. Requiring you to not only use the wind to your advantage, but also the waves of the ocean itself. You must navigate successfully, and command your crew to prioritize tasks onboard. All of this culiminating in an epic and tense battle, with the thunder of cannons and smoke filling the air. The gameplay itself harkens back to Pirates! as well as elements that remind me of EVE (massive map, crafting and trading). Players choose a nation to start with, which will determine your starting location (U.S, U.K, Dutch, Sweden, Spain, Denmark & Pirates). Each nation has unique challenges based upon number of ports and geographical location. Interestingly enough I jumped on the French side, and lo-and-behold, most of the players were speaking French! Once you start in your home port you can grab missions from the admiralty and head out to the open sea (which is an absolutely massive map of the Caribbean). Once in open sea you can engage battles that are under way, other players (if you're on a PvP server) or head towards your mission objectives.Eventually you gain gold, experience and promotions. Allowing you to build, buy, or capture better ships. PRO:- Fantastic looking- Authentic Historical ships- Immersive weather and large map- Crafting (seems decent so far)- Tactically deep- Map does not show where you are, requiring you to use visual markers and a compass (I think this could be a PRO or CON)CON:- UI is a bit rough at the moment but is fairly functional- No tutorial on gunnery, crafting or trading- Somewhat steep learning curve- Map does not show where you are, requiring you to use visual markers and a compass (I think this could be a PRO or CON)All in all, the UI is rough but the gameplay is solid. I was extremely skeptical of this title heading in, but after logging a few hours today I can safely say this game is already very fun and once it gets polished and more ships added in, it will be very very good.

								Reviewing an early release is notoriously hard, the game is still in development and who knows where it is going to go. But Naval Action, while still an Alpha, is shockingly playable for a game so early in its development. Game play is rather unique, and by unique I mean SLOW. Combat is slow, travel in the overworld is slow, crafting is slow, and that slowness is probably one of the greatest points of this game. If you are a fan of most modern games MMO or otherwise this slowness can be a schock. This is not Call Of Duty, or War Thunder. Naval Action is more a game of chess than a game of whack a mole. You plan your attack, you turn a few points off the wind and you wait for the enemy to roll into your broadside. A single ship to ship combat can take up to half an hour, a multi ship battle can take over an hour. Travel in the overworld takes planning and time, a trade route may take you hours of real time to travel. Nothing happens fast and in this quick twitch game heavy world the stately if slow action in Naval Action is a welcome change. Factions are a fact of life in Naval Action, there are no independent ships. You will have to join a faction in character creation but that does not mean Kill On Sight for every other faction; French Privateers will peacefully cruise past Spanish ships of the line in neutral waters, but you do need to watch your back. Just because you don’t attack does not mean you will not be attacked. Overall this is a pleasing game, but you do have to set some time aside to play a good session. I for one look forward to the further development of Naval Action, it has a lot of great potential.			"

								As an early access game, this is the most enjoyable to sail and hunt trader ships, pirates. Also anyone can join the clan to be a member of fleet. For me, interesting Features as PROS:  - Reallistic Waves on the sea      ( You can feel that your ship is floating on water. Not like the others did before )  - How Sails working depends on the direction of the wind  - Everyday they make improvement for this game  - Really(x100) huge open world (almost like real world)CONS:  - Lack of UI  - Can it be heavy for laptop game player     (Probably because of physics)My wishes for this game:  - Add some 18th C kinds of classical musics and pictures would be great  - release more ships from 17th C and cannon so that make game more diverse on choice of shipsbut as i said this is early access and Alpha so they can add some in near futureOverall, this game is worth 40bucks in my opinion.and i highly recommend playing and being a captain with your crew in late 18th-early 19th century.

								Beautiful Age of Sail Game, rich with historical flavor. I have enjoyed my time with game and have become quite addicted...this game will appeal to a more mature audience who have an appreciation for the period...folks with gamer ADHD should avoid this title...it will not hold your interest....Pros:Realistic Combat ModelBeautiful GraphicsRuns well on mediocre machinesMature Player BaseWell Done Crafting SystemEasy to learn but hard to masterBoth PvE and PvP contentLarge variety of ships to choose from'Lots of customization features (not graphical though, more mechanical (ie, upgrades))Rewarding sense of acievementAddicting to the right kind of playerCons:Map travel from point to point takes a great deal of timeBattles can be quite long (up to an hour, even for a single ship battle)A bit grindy for both progression and crafting (Of course, if you are enjoying playing, as I am, its really not a grind)Game requires patienceTip: Join the PvP1 EU server....even at 250 ping, the game runs just fine...most poulated server...if you just want to do PvE, stay close to your capital and you will be fine...I started PvE but switched to the PvP1 EU server...much more activity....

								This game was alot of fun starting out early in the beging of the year it was new and had alot of potentail, but the game seems like its been going down hill since then, player base has dropped alot as well. Some things i dislike about this game even though it is early access, the devs dont inform the player base very well unlike alot of other early access games or even full games for that matter. Also theres not alot to do besides grinding the game has become kinda stale. This will be the 2nd time the game has bored me to not wanting to play. Last thing im going to say is the game was alot more fun 8 months ago, also had alot of potential but has been dying very slowy. Use to have 5 servers now down to 3 now and soon to be 2 because not enough players. But all in all would not recommend this game at this time.ps. heres also a steam chart for naval action population from month to monthhttp://steamcharts.com/app/311310 "

								  I have owned this game for well over a year now and played the crap out of it way back when there was not as much stuff...Played it 130 hours took a break.   Now I come back after the EA release and the game is soo much better. Great fun, huge open world battles/crafting/trading which is getting improved constantly, also there is missions you can que for so you can just get in a pvp battle any time. The community is great and its one of the more helpful ones I have been in. 10/10			"

								I really do lke this game, that being said I cannot recommend it.  The updates that are pushed for it add almost nothing to the game, I fear the Devs will give up on it soon just like tons of previous early access games.  The combat works great, but after a while it just becomes monotonous, go here shoot this ship type of thing.  The main downfall of this game is definitely lack of content.  I feel unless the devs do something to fix it this game will die.			"

Early Access Review
								First off I""m giving a thumbs down only because it's Early Access and many issues have not been fixed that I feel should have been many moons ago.Well, you can see how many hours I've played, it's not  hundreds but it's enough to see what's going on. This game is very pretty, VERY pretty. So pretty in fact, I have to run it on all low graphic settings to squeak out 16 FPS. My gear is AMD 4300 quad core 3.8ghz 8GB RAM Radeon R7 250 w/2GB video RAM, it's not the fastest but I shouldn't have to ride the little bus just to run the game though. World of Tanks I run on high settings and get 25FPS and it's every bit as graphically intense. A minor quibble, let's get to other things.The levelling system is a tad grindy, maybe not Korean MMO grind, but tedious enough that unless you're a fan it will take weeks of steady game play to get from the starting 7th rate ships to 5th (grinding all the way to 1st rate is for the no life crowd). The combat, while immersive, is using the same tired old tricks every dev uses to make the AI ""difficult"", in other words it cheats. Nobody uses anything other then Round Shot, and there's a reason why. I took a Privateer down to 47% Sails using Chain Shot (the preferred method of anti sail attack) and it continued to achive 10 knots, in close haul to the wind, This flys in the face of the Bernoulli effect on sails...with a dozen melon sized holes in them. The entire point of using Chain Shot is to reduce their use of anything but running with the wind and reduce their speed to a crawl, making them easy prey (a lot of ships during the period would strike their colors once their ability to maneuver was removed). I guess the devs decided that was either too hard to code (or maybe not 'sexy' enough) or ran out of funding when that part came up. By way of another players account of using Grape Shot (think big shot gun) to reduce a ship that started with 155 crew to 25 crew, and they were still able to maneuver the ship and reload and fire all canons as if nothing had changed. Yet again, another option removed for expediency of coding I suspect. I think they incude these ammunition types for historical accuracy street cred, but in reallity the AI doesn't pack it in until the hull is gone, and the only thing that does that is Round Shot. Remember, the whole reason to use Grape Shot is to remove the crew without damaging the ship to much, because then you now own a slightly used ship which is often times worth tens of times more then the cargo it's carrying.Now, lets get to the strategic map, shall we? For some reason, after months of Alpha and Beta testers complaining that open Faction enrollment was leading to grotesque Zerg factions skewing strategic game balance not one jot has been done to fix that. I get it, it's hard to tell people they can't play their favorite nationality in favor of sucking more EA sales and turn a blind eye to the steam roll that is happening with the ports, but the end game is not fun for anyone, even the umbrella factions as they will quickly run out of opponents. Soon, everyone is bored and quits to play something else. As the French I watched the Pirate faction in the USA PvP server take half of Martinique in 2 hours. After logging on before writting this they own most of the eastern French, Swedish and Dutch ports, the USA faction owns the coastline to Mississippi and a dozen ports encroaching on Cuba, Great Britain owns half of the Mexican ports, it's just kinda ugly. There's competitive and there's one sided, the abscence of any balancing makes for these weird one sided steam rolls. The thing is this has been covered by every MMO that's come before and failed to deal with the gorilla in the living room issue of faction balance, we know how it ends, writing your resume for the next game company.I cannot comment much on the Crafting or Trade aspect of the game, but port control is a huge facet of Trade, and the juggernaut steam roll of the ports has left many to give up on Trade if they aren't in the few zerg factions. Crafting requires for the most part a reliable resource influx, which is often tied to...wait for it...Trade. As you can imagine, quite a few have switched sides to the zerg faactions simply because that aspect of the game they like dictates they do so.What can I say, this game is still in Early Access so there's a possibilty these issues will be resolved before release, but don't bet on it until you see a video of some old Alpha dog telling you it's safe to go in the water again. I keep thinking, all they needed to do was pay some German board game designer 10-20 thousand Euro for consulting fees and implement his/her ideas regarding game balance, because those German board game designers know how to make a good playable fair game.

								This game is not for the feint of heart. It requires work and dedication and for that it makes it fun.Amazing combat mechanics, graphics of the ship designs and models are very nice. Though this game requires alot more content that is inevitably taking longer to introduce per patch than expected. But nonetheless this game shows alot of promise.			"

								I like this game a lot; but I can't recommend it.  Designed to, as accurately as possible, portray the Age of Sail in the Carribean and Gulf of Mexico, the game does that very well.  The devs are working very hard to tweak it, add balance, etc.But authenticity comes at a price.  Unfortunately, the main cost is real time. This is a huge problem for the long term success of a game.  Just going on a simple PvP mission can take an hour or more.  By the time you sail to sea (crap - it's against the wind), get to your marker, conduct the fight, then sail back (crap - against the wind AGAIN), you have just spent 30-60 minuites (or more) in the game.  Seek out a larger PvE battle and the time goes even higher.  PvP battles can be even worse.Any battle can last up to 90 minutes.  That means if you have 60 minutes to play before you go to work, before your next class starts, etc you can't play because you may still be stuck in a battle by the time you must leave.  And even if you get out of the PvP battles, you may well find friends of the enemy waiting for you as you leave - sucking you back into another up to 90 minute battle - sometimes 2-3+ times in a row.For someone with no time constraints, that is fine.  For the majority of players with class, jobs, family, etc, the time cost is too high.Yes, if you can only play a short time you can pursue your crafting skills.  But, it literally takes only 10-15 minutes tops to use up all the labor points you have for the day, so crafting can't fill the short time void very often.  You can also make trade runs, but smart players build their outposts so trade runs are rarely needed; why risk losing one's cargo when one can ship in complete safety using the automated delivery system that entails 0 risk to ship or cargo - and again can be setup in 10-15 minute tops?And that really, is all you can do.  Fight.  Trade. Craft.  Even with the most well thought placement of your outposts, getting to an enemy port to raid or try to seige takes a long period of real time - followed by that up to 90 minute fight - or multiple fights back to back.Not only can most players not afford the IRL time sink, many others can't handle the long periods of inaction.You can select Small or Large fleet battles in port and skip the sail out anf back.  This helps a little but the battle can still go on for 90 minutes.I'm not sure what the devs can do to lessen the time drain.  The overall concept of the game is outstanding.  Battles, especially between groups of frigates are great fun.   But the average gamer is going to acknowledge the game's potetntial then move on to other games that offer more fast paced action. "

								This review is intended as a counter review to this guy's post: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991377081/recommended/311310/I have replied in the comments to his review http://i.imgur.com/GlEdvIE.jpg , but just like it was suggested this guy deletes all the positive feedback making it look like this game sucks. Go try to find my post. It was deleted 5 min after I posted it!That is a very close monitoring if you ask me. Is he on some kind of mission to destroy an image of a great game? To fool you to walk away from a very promising title? Here screenshot of other people trying to response to his post and got deleted too http://i.imgur.com/0WMHnPP.jpgMake your own call, but please make it educated.As for me, I will be reporting this guy to Steam moderators. Sounds more like a competitor's dirty play to me.Also... look at the average hours played of all the recent negative reviewers. 20-50 hours into the game for most of them? Are you really going to trust someone's opinion if he has just scratched the surface of a subject?I don't write reviews normally, but sense of fairness simply urges me to do something for the great game, its hard working developer team and the great player community. So here is my own experience with the game. No more, no less. But if you don't like to read and all you want to know if I will recommend this game? I will return the question back to you.Do you like the Age of Sail era?Do you understand that this is NOT arena based game like WoT and that you have to invest time in it like in any MMO games?Do you understand the fact that this is a very early access (not even a beta)?Are you ok to explore the limits of the game and report back to the dev team your feedback, suggestions or concerns?If the answer to all this yes, then HELL YEAH! I will recommend this game to you!And below is how I came to this conclusion-----------------------------First 5 hours into the game:What's with the UI???? It looks dull. I can't find anything. UI makes no sense... Oh! They have a message on the UI screen - Test UI Please Ignore. Ok, fair enough. How do I load cannons??? How do I do this, or that? Let me ask in Help chat. Wow! That was quick! The help from community was awesome. No trolling which was VERY refreshing. It felt that players loved the game and cared for it. Ok time to set sail..... WOW!... No words, the graphics, the land, THE SHIPS!!! Everything looks so amazingly real!. Oh this sound of squeaking rigging and bumping sails on air...  I mean, if your computer is half decent it will handle the astonishingly done Caribbean world. This water makes me want to jump in it!10 hoursWent back, picked up a mission and got out to the open world. Took a bit of sailing (3 minutes to be exact), but finally I'm there.Hmm... how do I shoot? How do I control the ship? I'm so confused! Back to Help chat and with help I got through the first missions. When the adrenaline got settled a bit, I decided to  invest time to learn properly, so off I went to YouTube.50 hoursI have learned basic controls. I have learned how to aim and how to use different cannons. I have done few missions and advanced couple of ranks. What next?OMG! I got tagged by a pirate! If you are not hit for 2 min then you can run away from the battle instance (that I've learned very quickly). I'm trying to get away from this dude. The Black Flag on his ship is getting closer. 10 seconds before timer run off he managed to hit me with his chaser cannons (I didnt even know those existed!) and reset the timer. I'm doomed now. I can't run away! I can't? OMG! Well hell with it! I'll give him a good fight of his life... Of course I was smashed miserably, but man... I have never ever experienced such adrenaline boost from any other game.Its time to look for a good community. I need more help and info. I need to learn. Where is the best place to learn PvP? I need to become a pirate!. Hard decision, but I'm no carebear. I got to find me good teachers!200 hoursI got pretty good at killing AI, I could now afford to get better ships (not perfect, but better). I had few encounters with real players. I made friends! I was given so much help (money, ships and most importantly all the valuable info)I was so surprised to learn that sails can be controlled manually and that to be efficient in PVP you actually have to sail manually.I have learned Point of Sail for the ships I sailed.I have learned how to rack the Stearn of an enemy ship (the back).I have capped my first trophy ship from another player.I have learned to manage my time properly so I'm busy doing other game related stuff during the long sails to distant areas (you only have to sail to the destination once, then you set up an outpost and can teleport to it instantly).But every time I think I got it sussed there is still something to learn.500 hoursI'm now on good terms with port battles and the conquest mechanics. I start leading raids. I've learned to use Mortar Brig.I have now mastered manual sailing and it is now just a second nature and feels like driving a manual transmission car. You no longer thinking about it.I have learned all aspects of ship mechanics. I have learned how to run away from ships that supposedly faster than the ship I sail.I've learned to understand The Wind in the open world and in the battle. How to turn it into advantage.I've have learned perfect wind tack (turning across the wind) without ever getting stuck in the irons.I've learned to shoot specific areas of the ship depending to what I want to achieve.I've mastered shooting under the waterline giving him so many leaks that ships were going down from a single broad side fire.I've learned how to de-mast the enemy.I've learned advanced tactics of naval combat how to read your enemy and predict his next move...1000+ hoursI have been pretty much in every corner of the Caribbean .I've made tons of friends and enemies.I've sunk more players than I could count.I've made numerous posts on forums helping the development of the game and was incredibly surprised and happy to see some of my ideas implemented into the game play.I confirm that:Developers DO listen! They even talk and reply to your comments on the forums and discuss game stuff.The content is getting updated and polished all the time.New ships are added (not as fast as we would wish, but every 2-3 months), though there are so many ships there already that we have plenty to choose from.The game is very alive and the development is very active.This is as much as you can get from a reviewer. The rest is up to you to try and decide for yourself, but don't let someone to fool you that this is just another ordinary title. With the community's support this game can really achieve a lot.Sail dangerously captains![BLACK] KoltesUS PVP2 Server, pirate faction			"

Early Access Review
								I've been in this game since it was in private alpha, more than 500 hours with a long break in the middle. There are pieces of it that are simply magical. There are others that are pretty rough. Hard to judge a game in early alpha, but as of now, I can only give it a very tentative thumbs up.The good:- As other have noted, the combat is incredible. If you have even the remotest interest in the Age of Sail, this is the combat sim for you. It is amazing. Combat is by far the best bit of this game, and may be worth the purchase price right there -- IF you are willing to stick with it. You really only begin to see the potential once you get out of the earliest levels and out of your default cutter.- The open world is beautiful to look at, and the ship models are gorgeous. They look and feel like I imagine frigates and ships of the line would have looked and felt at sea. Cannons roar, smoke billows. It’s jaw-droppingly realistic.- The PVP aspects are great, even for those who don’t like PVP generally (like me). This is a very slow game. It’s all about tactics, about limiting damage against and taking advantage of your enemy’s mistake. Fast twitch does nothing for you in this game, which is, frankly, awesome.- The new damage system is fantastic. It is physics-based, and takes into account range, size of cannon, the angle of your shot, the type of armor your enemy has, where on the hull or masts/sails it hits, etc. You can honestly snipe someone’s rudder, which is a very big deal. People are complaining about it now, but I think once it is tuned a little bit, people will come to love it.The bad:- So far, 90 percent of the effort has been on combat and new ships. If you aren’t into combat, and PVP in particular, there isn’t much else going on here right now. Careerwise, it’s pretty much all about fighting. Trading is dull. Crafting is tedious. And this is coming from someone who has done a lot of both, a level 48 crafter.- The devs have done a lot to limit ganking, and I don’t think it’s anywhere near the problem others do. I’ve never minded an unfair fight if it’s fun. This is a game, after all. But others seem to get more worked up about it than I do.- The worst part I think is the lack of newbie zones, and instead the game relies on players for the most part to defend those areas. I stopped playing MMOs seriously a while back, so maybe this is a new trend -- that somehow players will balance the world out. It hasn't worked out that way, at least on PVP1. And I'm not sure that’s realistic in a game world. But as a new player you’ll be thrown right into the thick of it. - In fact, I can’t imagine what this game would be like to come to new. There isn’t, as others have noted, much in the way of instruction. No in-game tutorial (yet). No really safe place to practice and learn. And as noted already, if combat isn’t your thing, you’ll tire of this game quickly. There is a pure PVE server, but the AI combat isn’t anywhere near as fun as PVP. - The port battle system sucks, and needs a massive overhaul (which, allegedly, is coming). Currently, it leads to incredibly boring dynamics where a nearly indestructible fleet arrives because they had time to prepare, and defenders didn’t, and it’s over really before it starts.- Pirates are silly as currently implemented. The devs are trying to maintain some connection to historical accuracy, but as of now the game system, oddly, allows pirates to be the most powerful nation in the game -- on PVP1 that is. Pirates should operate solo or in small groups. They should have completely different reward dynamics such as disrupting trade, running contraband, etc. And privateers should be a career option. Pirates should be flat-out banned from owning anything bigger than a frigate -- nor should they want to. Seeing a fleet of 25 pirate Santisimas is just -- wrong.All-in-all, this game is worth buying if you are a fan of Age of Sail. Even now, it’s well worth it. If you are not, or if you want to pursue a career other than one that is combat-oriented, I’d wait.			"

								After over 1000 hours played, I'm going to tell you why this game shouldn't be on your list of must have games. BANs and chat bans. This community makes every effort to basically pvp via chat versus effectively PVPing in the game. If you dont do something somebody doesnt like then if you say anything ""toxic"" as defined by ♥♥♥♥ing nothing, then you will be banned. no refund, not any way to state your side of the case, nothing. BTW there is no chat filter, which i would be fine putting in, but there isnt. This in turn has fostered a community of the thinnest skinned, crying little kintergarden teachers that you can imagine. And no matter how good your imagination is, this is worse. So dont for a second think you can act like anything but ned flanders from the simpsons while fighting in a game of murder and conquest. midwestern housewives should be all about this game, anybody else? not so much.The second problem is the pvp combat. This would be a great game if you got to actually fight somebody. The game has basically devolved down to playing fetch for an hour or better. The way the mechanics are currently you cant do anything, instead it takes upwards of 45 - 90 mins to actually chase down and sink somebody. Its basically boring as hell and unfortunately the only ""exciting"" combat is against NPCs which roll around the open seas like sea cows that never attrack any other player from another nation. This game started in pvp combat via the sea trials, and has made every attempt to get away from it's roots.			"

								It is hard to explain all of the reasons to like this game. I personally love the time period and have learned a bit about ships of that era from the game. The naval battles can be hectic in an amazing way ships everywhere and sometimes unintentional collisions while both sides try their best to fire the most cannon balls down range. Even in regular battles the lowest level allies are good to have, small ships are faster and more agile usually, also harder to hit due to small stature, so even if you are new you have some bonuses essentially to using your small boat.

								where to start it is great game and at the same time a terrible game.  The developers are morons who jump from one bad idea to the next usually in a knee jerk reaction to a small but loud whiny percentage of the player base.  Also if  you do not live in the EU do not buy this game.  The Devs have made it clear if you live in North America or Oceania you do not belong in their game.  It is not all bad the graphics are stunning and on the rare times you can actually get a pvp fight it can be a lot of fun.  But the population on the servers has been going down steadly at most you will find 500 players on at peak pvp1 server times and the US pvp2 server is even worse with peaks under 200 players.  What does this mean you can sail for hours in the huge open world of Naval Action and not see another ship. Even ai ships are rare.  Recent changes to game have also destoryed the will of many players to even play the game anymore.  Also you must be made aware that the Devs allow their friends in certain favored nations to cheat and ignore multiple reports of these cheats. so if you are looking for a level playing field Naval Action is not for you.  so in short save your money and look for a game where the developers actually give a damn about the product they are putting out.

								Really good game so far the combat is really fun and the graphics is amazing the game looks really good with a storm and thunder and lighting in the background and the night time is even better and seeing the cannons light up when you fire is really awesome. The sounds is also very very good as well hearing the cannons fire is pretty realistic and alot of fun.The game at the start is a little slow since you have to grind alot to get to the higher ranks to get the bigger ships but once you get rank 3-4 which in british terms is 2ndLT or 1stLT you will start to enjoy the game alot more and adjusting your manual sails for faster turn speed etc is necessary in full squared rigged ships.I Would high recommend this game if you are a ship lover and a history buff of this time period then you will defo enjoy it.

								PvE server review only.Pretty ships.Mostly fun combat.Boring as frag world. Hope you got a 2nd screen, cause you will spend 75% of your time in this game, watching movies.You spend so much of your time, just sailing from A to B, doing nothing.They could easily have made sailing automatic, because after a week, you've learned how to navigate and from then on you simply point your ship in the right direction, alt-tabs, and watch a movie meanwhile.At this stage, I'm not really sure what they aim to do with the world, except it being a ""capture eachothers ports 24/7"" kinda of thing for PvP...As for the PvE server... well... fight AI ships every day. Thats about it.Sure, you can lol... trade... lol!... Even Elite: Dangerous does trading better, and that says alot.AI... oh boy.. 1v1, very easy to predict, and even force into certain maneuvers so you gain the advantage.In 2v1 or fleet orders with several enemies, you better NEVER point your ships stern (rear) toward ANY enemy ship... They will fire pin point accurate laser guided balls at you, that ALWAYS hit your stern nomatter the range, killing crew and destroying cannons + rudder.Server crashes. Dont happen often, but when it does.... well read below.Ships have durabillity. (basicly the amount of times a ship can sink, before its gone forever).Server crash during missions, causes ships to lose a durabillity.The most expensive and time consuming to build ships in the game, only have 1 durabillity...So... 1 crash = -1 ship.""But you wont lose the ships with 2+ durabillity!"".Right... But it makes it impossible to resell thoose ships on the market again and thus is reduced to either NPC fodder or breakin them down to materials.So yeah, if you want to buy this game for its PvE, keep in mind that you will enter a very empty world with very little to do.

								First off, let me say to those poor souls that have not been buying this game due to bad reviews, i am sorry. Here is why you should give this game a true chance, and I think you will find most people whining on here just wanted easy game play. -First and foremost, the teleport thing. I am tired of seeing people cry about teleporting in here, then in game rage quit because they got caught and couldnt teleport away. The teleport only works every 3 hours, and it only teleports you to your main capital. You can however move from outpost to outpost once you have docked your ship in a city with an outpost to another outpost, in a sense teleporting. This is simply due to the time it takes to sail, do you really want to sail for 5 hours to go to somewhere that only requires you to be there for 2 minutes for? -The TRUTH ABOUT THE DEVS.          The Developers of this game are not all English, so of course there is sometimes a slight language barrier. However i have dealt with and happily worked with these Devs since January of 2016, and let me tell you. These guys work hard as all heck to get it right. They believe in taking the time it requires to test everything out, from extreme to extreme in order to find a balance and the best possible way to allow for pvp in the pvp servers, and give good pve in the pve servers. I have lost several ships to glitches (its Early Access it happens) the devs know that, and they completely brought those ships, and everything on it back from Davy Jones' locker several times for me and several other players.         The devs on this game take a lot of crap from players that dont understand how to test a game completely with a smaller playerbase, it really is as simple as that. The devs want to try everything out because honestly, this game while not the complete first of its kind, has reached a point where no other sailing game has ever gone before or even gotten close to. It is required of the smaller dev team to work on one thing at a time from most to least important to find balance, try radical things to see what happens and how to fix any errors in game and to truly know how to further develope the game. -This game has so many great things, my favorite is the AMAZING GRAPHICS. And i mean truly breath taking graphics. For once in gaming history, the screenshots on the store page need to be taken down because they are not good enough to show what this game looks like on med-high settings.  With the amazing graphics also comes the support of and almost a symbiotic relation with the physics engine, its awesome, needs some work, but its still awesome none the less.THE BAD... -If you dont enjoy a grind.. This game forces you to do well and do it often in order to advance ship wise and crafting wise. -Like i mentioned, the updates take a bit, usually once a month for major updates, but patches come for the next 3 days generally after a major update. I think its worth it. -Right now the player base is small, and this game needs a larger player base, i am writing this review to help that, everyone on this game wants you to buy it and join their nation, the mroe people that play, the more fun this game truly is. especially in the pvp server.

								Been playing closed Alpha since May last year, it is a beautiful game aimed at people with a passion or an interest in the age of sail. If you are a mature gamer you will love it.  It has been the most stable EA game i have yet played, the graphics are amazing and the future promises a great deal to do, although at present most of the stuff outside battles is place holder or still to be expanded upon. Highly recommend this game to non toxic and anyone who loves sails.			"

								I've played this game a fair bunch, so let me give you some pros and cons : PROS : + Realistic combat, battles can take ages, but are really exciting and fun to do. + Beautiful battle graphics.+ Really fun to play with people you know. But also fun to play alone.+ If you're not really good in fighting, you can always switch to trading and crafting as a way to make money.+ You can teleport to the capital every 3 hours, so meeting up with friends is easier. + A lot of interaction with other players, there's always one telling you where to look out/hunt for pirates.+ Battle from a port. You don't have to sail ages to get in a big battle with multiple ships,you just can hop right in one using the tab in any port. + Fairly balanced. + You can create multiple characters, but your progerss is bound to your steam id, this makes it easy to change factions if you've got a friend willing to help. + Durability system for your ships, you won't lose it after it's sunk the first couple of times. ++ Epic large battles :DCONS : - It takes a fair amount of time to get from one place to the other, there's no teleport system. (kinda understandable, as it'd be unrealistic)- Leveling up takes a long time if you're on your own. - Open world graphics are a bit worse than the battle graphics. - Hard to begin with. (Early stages of the game are a bit meh)- Repetative missions.- Crew is way to expensive.- People who play on the pirate faction and board you :( (If you're with friends, always team up when on a trade mission).- Uninteresting UI.

								Man, I was so hoping to really like this game, and for the most part, it isn't ""bad"". It's an EA game, that seems to have it's ""goals"" set a little low, and unwilling to improve it.The ship combat is top notch. No doubt about that. They spent two years polishing the combat, and it shows. But, with a 10 man team, and 2 years to get this combat down, seems slow, even for just 10 guys. The ship models are sharp, great looking..BUT..The damage model is lacking. All you get is some torn sails, and holes in the hull that look like bulletshots in a wall on COD. No real destruction, no gaping holes, no little guys going flying(which isnt really needed), and the fire that can break out, looks dated at best. Sure, you have to aim your shots, and you have different ""modes"" of firing them. Plus if you want to maximize your turning, you have to manualy turn your sails. (There is an ""auto skipper"" that can do this, but it isnt going to work if you play any pvp). There is a thread on the forums, on steam, where the Dev's ""answer"" some questions. And, most questions (granted some are a little ridiculous, but most questions seemed to ask about things that could only improve a MMO. And, the answers were; ""Maybe, could, Dont know, and it's in there already""..Not what I would call answers to any of them. Yeah, some things may be out of reach for a small 10 man team. But, some things sould be very do-able, and were/are shot down, for ""reasons"". With a mini-game boarding action, and can't be bothered to give you any map tools (because it's ""Hand Holding"")I find that this game is going to be very over priced.In my opinion, if you are going to make the ""next"" Pirates of the Burning Sea, but realistic. You need some MMO aspects that people can get behind. Not, just a great ""feeling"" in battle. If that was their main focus, they should have just kept their ""Battle Arena"" game they were working with, and left the MMO part to other games. It could have been a great 1700's ""World of Sail"", like World of Warships...And, left it at that.This review may change later, if I can tell that they will get rid of this idea that making a game unnaturally difficult, in  disguise because they call it hand holding. (Which I feel like its more because it would be a pain in the ___ for a 10 man team) And, spend the time, or hire more Dev's to help, because it will be lacking a lot, if they don't. (It's not like they couldn't afford it with 40$ a pop)So, the pvp/pve action battles: Id give a 8 out of 10the trading(which they say they are working on, they probably are) 3 out of tenThings to make it feel like a MMO: 2 out of 10I would wait!(Update) Ok..It's been a year since I bought this 40$ game. And, I can't see any real progress. Some towers added, a ""Officer"" (that I cant tell does anything), s few ships, and some weird crud with the map. (cant even explain the map junk)....10-100 ppl on a server at any given time....Dont waste your money on this title!			"

								it is a great and super atmospheric game if you liked elite dangerous or EVE  NOT only for the space ships but for the trading and crafing. this game has particular (for the moment) player driver economy system . A epic battle system Not like in the majority of other games which have a stupid HP system and if the health reaches 0 you are gone. in this game your sides have armor. when recieving DMG the armor will drop and it will be easier to pierce a shot. when the armor is almost gone you can easyly pierce with shrapnell which does a LOT of crew dmg. and it easyer to pierce below the waterline. each penetration you score below the waterline will create a leak when you ship have leaks will will take water but thats no problem. your ship have a PUMP when you are taking water you´ll need to assign a part of your crew to the pumps. and the leaks will be fixed over time. but when your st. pavel ( a very big ship ) will get a whole broadsider of like 40 cannons under his waterline  he´s gone in like 10 sek. but it hard to score hits below the waterline (because , if you didn´t know : its usually UNDER water) there is a easier way to sink a ship: you can just shoot down the armor of one of the sides to 0 . when the aror is gone he will take big amouts of water and will sink in a couple of min.  loosing you Bow or stern armor is not so dramatic. you will need just like 20 men on the pumps all the time to compensate it.in the open world there are lots of harbours. they belong to a couple of fractions. you chose one on start.but if you dont like your fraction, dont worry . you just need to attack a ship of the same frac to turn PIRATE  which are basicly a own fraction. so players can capture enemy ports for there frac. each port produces it own resourses. you can buy them there for cheep and sell them somewere else (this is the AI economy) if a port produces ex. iron ore you also can build there an outpost and build  a iron mine. there you can ""buy"" it for much cheaper but you also will need labour houres ( you get 42 in one RL h or like 1008 a RL day) .there is a crafting system . you have a separate crafting lvl. so a LVL one (there is no lvl one  but anyway) player can be crafting lvl 50 to craft a ship you need the resourses , the BP a given LVL and LH (labour hours) .  there are some ship Blueprints that are given once reaching a specific crafting LVL. and some you can get by crafting other ship (for ex. i craft a frigate(you get the friagte BP once reached LVL25) and with a chance i will get a Belle poule BP, a ingermanland BP a trincomalle BP and so on.  the chance is based on some factors.mainly on the quality of he ship you are building (there are : basic,comon,fine,mastercraft and exeptinal) there are some ships you need like a week for(if you are doing it alone)p.s. im sorry english isn´t my 1st language . if i done some grammar errors or something else pls excuse me .

								I used to play Pirates of the  Caribbean Online, and while it doesn't feature land interaction (yet), I think this game will really appeal to that crowd. And while I understand the game is still early access, my only gripe with the game is it's not easy to pick up right off the bat and there's no tutorial. But once you get the hang of it, it is fun.

								Believe the hype.Naval Action offers a borderline simulator experience with its age-of-sail combat gameplay. Take command of anything from a simple schooner to powerful Ships-of-the-Line. Travers a massive map of the Caribbean and experience beutiful sights and sounds of the Age-of-Sail. In-depth naval combat mechanics means you control your yards and aim your cannons all while attempting to manuever and dodge gunfire yourself. Mistime or aim incorrectly and watch your broadside fly over the enemy's deck or hit the sides of a wave insted of the enemy's hull. Misuse your sails and you'll find yourself face-first to the wind and unable to move, am easy sitting target for your enemies.This is NOT a pirate game. This is an Age-of-Sail game. While pirates are a playabe option, they are by no means easy to master. The game offres a challenge while still being fun. As is expected with Early Access, there are still a bit of impurities and imbalance, but even so, the combat system alone is very well honed and can offer some interesting yet not altogether lopsided battles. This is a must for anyone who is interested in the Age of Sail.			"

Early Access Review
								Be it known I have recently gotten the game  (11/3/2016) about the time I got it there was a huge wave of recently negative review's because the player base is Whinging about not being able to build there precious Exceptional ships whenever they like with next to know effort, because that is what they have gotten use too....All I can say is GOOD....  I am also looking forward to the server wipes that WILL come pre-release...This is after all a game in Alpha that is not finished.The fact that this game has recieved so many negative reviews is just a straight up TRAVESTY of epic proportions!But hey its the new generations way, if everything is not handed to the new generation with a silver spoon well lets right a review crying about how dumb the developers are for making the game harder!!!Okay now that I have gotten the above out of the way!  Its time for an honest review....This game is a Masterpiece!!!!  Its not polished, its got alot of tweaking and fine tuning to iron out but the core concepts are rock solid.  Its the first MMO I have started playing in years that has actually hooked me and kept my attention, this is a rare gem.Most games today Pre release in a terrible state, they have nice graphics and thats about it, its like the video game industry has turned into a major cash grab.  This game atleast doesnt leave you feeling cheated...So what is it?Its basically Pirates of the Burning Sea without the Tiny Fast forward OverWorld map...  In Naval Action you still have an over world map and you then zone into the battle but its 1 to 1 so that makes the over world large and spacious its genius really....  Its exactly what PotBS always needed....  So now you can sail around and you may not see another player for 5, 10 , 15 minutes or you might see 6 of them in less then 5 minutes...  So makes for the perfect balance on PvP and PvE all on the same map!  -However Naval action has cut down on the number of ships you see in the over world dramatically compared too PotBS.  This can at times make the world feel empty or dull, but ultimately as a person that loves realism I still love this because its realistic  if you were cruising around the carribean back in this day you would not see ships EVERYWHERE...  -One Major issue with Naval Action is the Over abundance of players with 1rst 2nd and 3rd Rates....  Infact thats like 95% of the playerbase...  And they all seem to have this point of view that its there inherit right to own a 1rst rate...  This really makes the game feel cheesy and gay when everyone is running around in an exeptionally crafter 1rst rate...Thankfully the developers have started to take steps to make exceptional ships harder to make and larger ships harder to make....  This is MUCH NEEDED but it also created all those Negative reviews from the spoiled playerbase complaining about how they had the stuff to make a 1rst rate yesterday and now they don't.... BOO HOO cry more!!!  This game has a vast array of resources, materials, trade commodity's it has the tools and potential to create a game with an economy to rival Eve Online....  However Currently the Economy is broken money is stupidly easy to make, ships are stupidly cheep to buy and the playerbase as a whole is spoiled rotten, and they feel that money is too hard to make???As a new player less then 4 days into the game I have over 3 Million gold which I could use to buy my way into the elite ship club?!?  After 4 days???  And it wasnt hard nor challenging to accomplish this....  So I dont understand all the negative reviews and all the crying....  The Dev's are making steps in the right direction to fix the economy and I pray they stick to there guns and keep going as the Player base is obviously not always right....So overall this is one of the best new MMO's to release in ages....In many ways its everybit as good as PotBS wasIn many ways it needs alot of tweaking and adjusting to make it what could be a Masterpiece.And in many ways its not as good as PotBS....However if you enjoyed PotBS or if you enjoyed Port Royal games or you liked Eve Online...  This game is in Alpha and even in its unfinished state can rival all those games and give you right now an amazingly fun game experience!!!11/28/2016 Update the I still feel the same way about the above review!

Early Access Review
								First off, this is an early access game. I realize the price is steep for an early access game, but this is quite simply one of the most fun games I've probably ever played, both in the open world MMO genre and in general. I've easily gotten more enjoyment out of it than the last $30-$40 full release titles I've purchased, and the hours speak for themselves.The Awesome:1. Combat is absolutely amazing. It plays somewhat like a chess match, in both large fleet actions and single ship actions. Each side makes a move, to which the other side attempts to counter. In a large battle, this mainly comes down to your side's shot caller attempting to give as many of his ships as possible a shot on the opposing fleet. In single ship fights, much of  the skill comes down to maneuvering to rake your opponent's stern to kill crew and dismount cannon until he can no longer fight, while preventing him from doing the same.  The combat is definitely the most polished part of the game, and it shows.2. Development: I say this mainly because the game already is in development, but I've seen very few games capable of treading the thin line between giving the players what they want, and doing what's best for the players and the game as a whole. These devs have done an amazing job on this, and many player suggestions throughout closed alpha and even early Steam release have found their way into the game. In addition, the development cycle is very regular, with a major content patch around the middle of each month, along with usually 2 ships added to the game. In addition, the devs have added multiple player-made ships to the game.3. The Open World map: This is probably the most important part of the game. The open world map is a scale representation of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, based off of maps from the time period of the game (early 1800s-late 1700s). This is how you get from port to port and find other players to sail or fight with. When engaging other players, your position relative to them and both of your positions in relation to the wind translates directly into the battle instance, making positioning in the OW almost as important as actual combat skill. A recent update now translates any land you may be nearby into the battle as well, meaning cunning captains can pin smaller and nimbler ships against land when they would otherwise be able to sail away unscathed. In addition to that, major fleet AI battles can be found quite easily in the open world as well (but make sure you bring friends).The Not So Awesome (outdated, see EDIT):1. Finding a fight: One of the biggest complaints is the difficulty of finding a fight in the open world. This can be a challenge, but it does depend primarily on where you are trying to find fights. Generally, the closer to Cuba/Jamaica you are, the better the change of finding a fight (this primarily concerns the PVP1 server). Free Ports (uncapturable by any faction) allow you to base ships closer to these areas to get into the action quicker. In addition, duels can be set up in the port screen (just ask around in national or local chat for a dueling partner, and remember your ships must be the same battle rating to duel), which gives a loss-free way to practice handling your ship before jumping into real danger in the open world. 2. Game Economy/Crafting: This is probably the least polished portion of the game, meaning everything I say here is subject to change. The economy is inbetween a full player driven economy and an AI driven economy. Money can be made quite easily by your production buildings, and those resources in turn supply the shipbuilders. Ships require resources to build if you want an above average one, otherwise basic versions with a minor flaw or minor improvement (to speed, crew space, rigging, etc.) can be bought for very affordable prices from the AI. AI only sells up to 4th rate 60 gun ships however, anything larger must be built by a crafter or captured from another player. If your objective in buying the game is to become a major crafter/trader and nothing else, you may want to wait for this feature to mature before purchasing.3. The ""Grind"": You'll find many reviews that complain about the game's grind. At the end of the day, the game is only a grind if you make it one. Unlike War Thunder, World of XXX, or other arena games where you are forced to play a vehicle  to unlock the next, the only limiting factor in Naval Action is the crew you can command. You start with 40, and this increases as you go through the ranks. You can still purchase any ship on the market if you have the money to do it, and some ships can be used without much downside with less than maximum crew due to crew management mechanics added to the battles shortly after steam release. In addition, the thresholds for how much experience (earned by damaging and sinking/capturing enemy ships in battle) is required for each rank was recently reduced by a large margin. All that being said, don't fall into the trap of thinking ""bigger ship = better ship."" The captain's skill ultimately decides the battle. Even a cutter (starter ship) can make the difference in an open world battle, and I know this from personal experience.EDIT FOR 9.8 PATCH: With the 9.8 patch, finding a fight in OW is no longer an issue. Teleport timers have been completely removed when going from outpost to outport, allowing players to jump around the map to various hotspots as they please (so long as they have an outpost in the area). This makes it quicker and easier than ever to fight PVP.In addition, ship durability/HP has been compressed, meaning there is no longer as much of a difference in the punishment each frigate can take compared to each other, or for how much each ship of the line can take compared to each other. Also, many new upgrades were added to further allow players to customize their ships, as well as all the other awesome changes in the 9.8 patch notes.			"

Early Access Review
								Bought this original cause of Empire Total War and Darth Mod's additions to it, though while the ship combat is enjoyable and reminiscent of Empire, the overall gameplay is severly lacking. The combat gameplay itself isn't bad, and at times enjoyable even.  Ships sail like proper ships, you can adjust sails individually to pull off specific maneuvers, guns feel solid, ships feel proper for their class, crews are quite a bit lacking specially compared to Empire but they do exist there to provide a semblance of not sailing a ghost ship.Though the issue occurs what happens outside of combat, the UI is primative though that's really nothing that can't be easily fixed.  The game is grindy, quite grindy and overall trys to play like Eve Online.  Deaths matter quite a bit, your ships have durability and once that's gone you lose your ship, it is open pvp though there isn't quite the base there to support it.  PVE is mudane, you spend couple minutes sailing to some designated spot to fight a ship that will spend that entire battle just running away from you which is a valid strategy but doesn't quite make for fun gameplay.  Once that's over you get a trickle of xp, barely some gold and sail back for a couple minutes to rinse and repeat for slow progression.  The game does somewhat allow you to play above your level cap in return for paying into a essentially gold sink in the form of crew members, but the paltry rewards never quite make it worth it.  Beyond that there is a semblance of a crafting system, though it isn't anything spectacular or interesting.  Overall PVE is simply just a chore.  If you're playing for the PVP you may have slightly better luck out of the experience, though pvp relies heavily on the people, but without a proper fundation to build the pvp on your experience may vary.Really a shame given how enjoyable Empire's ship battles were, but in the end this game at it's current state is and unpolished, endless grind that never really seem to get anywhere.

								Just from browsing a few reviews I couldn't believe how many negative reviews this game has gotten. I see people with around 1,000 hours giving it a negative review. How can someone drain that much time into a game and not like it? Doesn't quite add up to me. Obviously there's something good about the game and they're lying their *** off if they can play for a solid 41 days and still say it's crap. Or maybe they're that dense and it takes them that long to realize they don't like something. Other reviews I see people saying it's a boring world and you spend most of your time going from A-B doing nothing and blah blah blah. Do you even know what game you bought? Did you research it at all? Helloooo, it's a 1800's naval game that takes place in a huge ocean and you sail old wooden vessels at 2-18 knots depending on the weather gauge; obviously it's going to take some time getting around. Realistically it could take ships weeks or months to get from A-B, in the game yeah it can take 15-60 minutes depending how long of a voyage you're embarking on.I've seen some reviews saying the devs don't add much. I think they add plenty and are taking their time to get things right. Everytime they add new things I'm always excited for it to patch and get into the game. If they aren't doing enough I think their expectations are too high, not every game is produced with a massive dev team. Some things I've found amazing they've added to the game just off the top of my head are: ship armor thickness, weather systems, seagulls (with sounds), different nations ports have different looks, fishing, they average adding about 2-3 new ships each month, and plenty more.All in all this game is everything and more that I can ask for. Just a few experiences from my voyages in the Caribbean, the other day I stumbled upon Captain Kidd's hideout (not on the map), currently I'm sailing to the Santa Cecilia ship wreck (the location of which I discovered in a sealed bottle), all the while having my crew fish from the sea. Last week I went and visited the American Colonies just to say I had been there. Before taking off to find the lost ship wreck I intercepted a French Essex and also a 3rd Rate Pirate vessel with the help of my brother. It's a great game to play with friends, the community is excellent, and there is more than enough things to do with more and more being added each time a patch comes out every week or so. Don't let the negative reviews fool you, this game is absolutely amazing and I absolutely recommend it to everyone who loves the seas!			"

Early Access Review
								Naval Action. What can I say? Firstly, I had to wait months to buy this game. It isn't cheap, especially when money is tight... $54.87 Australian to be exact. Some may think this isn't much money, but to some it is. Well, even in it's Alpha stage it is more value for money than you can imagine.... less than 14 cents an hour for me at the moment, 14 cents! Is it the right game for you?Do you have an interest in the Age of Sail?Do you like your games to look beautiful?Do you have time to sit back and enjoy a game for what it is, lots of sailing around the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico?Are you aware that it is a game under heavy development?Do you enjoy chatting to people from around the world?If your answer is Yes to any or all of these, then Naval Action is the game you have been looking for!Before I continue I must say that I only play on the Player vs Environment (PVE) server at the moment. It is the perfect place to hone your sailing skills, learn to fire your cannons accurately, and learn about the trading and ship building. I will give Player vs Player (PVP) a go when the final game is released.There is something about the mesmerizing movement of the sea that really draws me in. This is so in real life, but also in this game. There are many great Youtube videos around that I watched for hours before I bought the game. I really fell in love with the graphics and sound. I won't link to any particular video, but just do a Youtube search for GrunfWorks or Jeheil.The detail and rendering of these beautiful old ships is second to none. I would love the developers to introduce a cinematic replay option for the battles, that would be fantastic. I have to say there is a certain amount of pride when you finally manage to buld a ship from the next level up and finally get to sail her :)Some other reviewers have said ""All you do is sail"", or words similar to that. Well, it is a game set in the age of sail, and yes there are many hours of sailing in the ""open world"", but this is done at 60 times faster than real time. At first I thought this was too fast, but when you look at the sheer size of the map I think the developers got the speed about right.As I mentioned earlier, it is a game that is heavily in development. That isn't a secret. Why would I or anyone buy a game that isn't even finished? This is easy to answer.... because even in it's current stage of development, it is better than many AAA games out there, and it is without doubt the best age of sail game ever produced.Finally, (well almost) I would be lying if I said this game didn't have a steep learning curve, and there is no official game manual or tutorial yet. However, there is a help chat in game that all players of varying levels of experience willingly provide help to rookie players. To say that the player community is helpful is an understatement. It never ceases to amaze me how patient the vast majority of players are when providing support to new and not so new players. No question is too dumb :)I started this review by asking if Naval Action was the game for you. If you have read down this far then I would say don't wait any longer, just buy it!!! It's a great game, great people play it, and it is developed by passionate people. "

								This game is awesome ! You get to play beautifull ships in an eve online mmo type environment. Graphics are quite good and immersion is great.Pros :- Naval combat gameplay is great. You have to deal with wind, gravity, penetration, waves... You can damage enemy's sails to harm he's speed, his crew to harm ship handling and canons reload and his hull to sink him. This mix allows a wide variety of tactics, skill is extremely important and you can surprise your enemy by mixing things up.- You can play any way you want. Trade, craft, play pve for lvl ups AND practice (very important before you start pvp).When you pvp you can play as a soldier in the army and work together in the conquest of enemy ports, as a privateer and kill players in hotzones to harm enemy nations, or as a pirate type hunter boarding traders for valuable cargos.- A cruel world : When you loose a battle, you really loose something if you cant escape ; your ship, your cargo, your mens, your officer... But not everything. Ships have several ""lives"", same for officer, and if you dont play like a fool, you'll manage... But this sensation of ""real death"" in defeats brings immersive tension to fights.- I cant list everything i love about the game... Just too many.Cons : - An unfinished product : Interface is ugly, rules are changing from patch to patch, but it's all about the early access state of the game. I have no doubt the game will become more user friendly at release.- The relation between OW accelerated time and battles real time. When you sail in open world, time passes faster, your ship moves faster etc. Obviously because if it was not, sailing from one point to another would take way too much time. But battles are played in ""real time"" so the devs have to find a way to make things fair about this, because you can not allow a player who is 5 hours of real sailing away from his clanmate to be able to join and help him in 5 minutes. Which means the game has to pull some artificial engagement rules to make things fair+fun+realistic. And, this is not polished yet in my opinion but hopefully it will come.			"

								I was one of the First guinea pigs about a year plus ago when they made it available long before Steam When I bought it, you could only play something called Sea Trails, which was only combat and no open world. I got a bit tired of the wipes, but loved the detail of the ships and the excellent graphics. When it went onto Steam and started ""open World"" it looked like it had taken 20 steps backward. The whole concept of open world is appealing, but its implimented so poorly, its a struggle to even understand how any of the menus or selections work. It has bar none the owrst interface I've ever seen.I'm personally not that interested in all the crafting and trading aspects they are working on, but being a pirate doesnt sound half bad. I happily played this when it first strarted moving up thru all the ships rather easily without to much gring until you go to some really big stuff. I did enjoy the matches, and the Trafalgar battles wee terrific.As it is now, someone who has not played this game before wont have a clue as to what to to or how to play. Its just awful. At least I had the benefir of having many hours (160) sailing and fighting over a period of 6 months.There is core group of those early players who have gotten to know each other quite well, and many (not all) have that superioity attitude and either ignore, insult, or sealclub the ""noobs""The ""noobs"" a lot of them are going to pass the word about the incredibly horrible interface, the interminable grind and the somewhat toxic environment, not to mention the price they are asking.This is  a GREAT sailing ship fighting game, it overeached on its goals and regretfully is going to disappont a lot of people.I			"

								This is an amazing ""Sim"" set in the 18th century. Man-o-Wars, Frigates, Brigs, and so on. Even named vessels are available, such as the Essex, the Constitution and the Victory. (and more)For an early access game this game is pretty well polished. A nice selection of ships for the state of the game from 7th Rate all the way to 1st Rate.The graphics are beautiful. The water looks spectacular, and thats a good thing for a ship game. The Ship models look outstanding as well. Then there is combat; when those cannons flash out in front of you and you lose all direction from the gun smoke rolling across the water, and as the cannons impact you can watch sails tatter and shrapnels of wood spray into the air. Just amazing.The main practice of the game is warfare (both PvE and PvP), however there are rather good trading and crafting elements built into the game as well. A sort of... Elite Dangerous but with boats.I do recomend this game, however be warned, this game is a time sink. Even traveling around the map can take hours of sailing. A larger battle can also take upwards to an hour sometimes more, but this game is not boring even with the lengthy battles and travel times.Overall I look forward to what this game has to offer in the future as even in its current state it is very playable and Ive already sunk (<- ship pun) hours of time into it.

								I generally like age of sails and this game does make a lot of promises. The combat system is functioning well and the crafting system is rather decent. Yet it fails completely when it comes to content and the developers doesn't seem to know how to add content that is both engaging, fun and rewarding. Extremely frustrating since the game does promise a lot. I do hope they hire a writer og gamedeveloper that has experience in creating missions and storylines because at this moment this game doesn't really deliver on all those promises.			"

								Disclaimer: I am a age-of-sail combat fanboi. Have been since I read Hornblower when I was age 6.That said, Naval Action delivers everything I expected and more when it comes to ship and fleet combat. The sailing and gunnery mechanics are intricate without becoming unmanageable, different ships behave very differently. Particularly in PvP engagements, combat for me is tense, even though it moves at a relatively sedate pace.The open world and the RvR meta-game is where Naval Action leaves little middle ground between love and hate. Personally, I like playing in a clan and dabbling in grand strategy, but I get my main kicks out of ship combat. As such, the major mechanics and balancing shifts that took place on the strategic, RvR level do not tick me off as much as they understandably did some players who are in it for the strategic conquest before anything else.Thus buyers will need to beware that the game is in Alpha, and therefore the center of balance is still shifiting around (particularly on the strategiclevel). I have been abaoard through a number of changes that the players consider quite fundamental, and they have not diminished my enjoyment. Rather, meaning I have to re-think standard recipes every now and again keeps me on my toes.			"

								I have bought the game back in November/December 2014. I liked the period, but was a bit sceptical, especially when combined with a paypal payment method and was just willing to try it.How much was I mistaken. It is my most played game on steam right now. I did hunt AI ships alone. I did chase player ships off the perceived turf with a group. For a time I was the one of lucky few, who were able to build HMS Surprise. I did successfully trade iron, when there was almost none left in the whole carribean. I went to the edge of the world. I met people that were nice and crude, honorable and dishonorable, dauntless captains as well as cowards. Does this appeal to you? If yes, this game might be just for you. HOWEVER, you have to be willing to overlook some substantial flaws, at least for a time. Terrible UI. No help, if you don't search for it/ask. You have to be willing to accept behavioural standards of the community (courteous, gentlemenly). You have to be willing to learn. You have to be able to think of the battles as battles, not as the grind. 2nd HOWEVER, you get an opportunity to participate in the development of the game you have been waiting for for the last 10-15 years, due to the great devs, who really listen. (I can pinpoint some features that are in the game to originate with specific players and specific posts on the forums).I will not tell you if the game is right for you. For me, best 40 EUR I spend on a game. For an early access title 9/10.			"

								I have played this game from the very start. Way before it came to steam. I can honestly say the game is dead. I keep seeing people saying stats on player numbers but when I am in game there are fewer than 70 and I am on at a normal time. I use to enjoy this game with friends and do co-op battles. For some reason the devs got rid of this because..... reason. You will spend 85% of your time sailing in the open world doing nothing. Sail speeds drag on forever. On PVP depending on your server pretty much one nation controls most of the map. This game is no longer any fun. I have no intention of returning to the game unless they bring back being able to play with friends on co-op in the open world again.edit:When I say co-op I do not mean missions. I mean open world see an npc ship and attack it. Even if my friends are right next to me they can not enter the battle. So you I am not lying when I say that.I also need to add that I play on the US server at the time I played the US held most of the map. Currently they do not. at 1800 eastern time USA there are currently 82 people online.			"

Early Access Review
								I have never written a proper review for a game on Steam before, but I feel as if I have to for this game.In short, it's beautiful. The Open world is gorgeous and seemingly full of activity that ranges from lone/grouped pirates on the hunt, AI fleets or trade ships are full of cargo and are ready to be plundered. The map is stacked full of visitable ports/cities (as long as your nation has a hold of it).The combat is in-depth and can be complex. That being said it can also be forgiving against the AI and the game developers allow you to have unlimited free repairs for the beginning ship which gives you the freedom to test your skills without punishing you. Everything from the winds direction, the waves & the caliber/type of your guns can affect the course of a battle significantly, which adds an unexpected element to the battles. Does your enemy have long range cannons or Carronandes? Are you Up wind or Down wind? Is there a storm at the moment, or is the ocean calm? This all adds a unique experience to each and every battle which personally, keeps me drawn in.PVP is awesomly fun, with both open world PVP or Small/Large battles you que up to and play in. They are generally 10v10 for small battles and 25v25 for large battles, which can get hectic but are always fun. Teamwork plays a major factor, shepherding ships across friendly broadsides, keeping the ship distracted while a friendly rakes their stern or even assisting in boarding by grape shotting the enemy ship (careful not to hit your friendlies).The ship designs are wonderful, even though I would prefer to be able to see my crew during the open world sailing. Each ship has different characteristics, some being hulks with more guns or corvettes built for speed which allows the player to explore with their prefered traits. The crafting system also allows players to construct and modify ships to add special abilities. For example, a Snow- typically a slower ship- can have upgraded rigging and be built out of a lighter wood, which will increase it's speed for a lack of armor.I would prefer if they added some in-game music from the era, but I usually just remedy that with some youtube of either the Assassins Creed Black Flag sea shanties or some classical music from Mount and Blade: Napoleonic Wars.The community is wonderful and always ready to help, which is quite rare in my mind. It may be because the game has a bit of a learning curve that it deters people who would rather ""troll"" then play properly. Some people have been around for a long time, and some since the steam release and they integrated quite easily to form a very solid community that I am happy to be apart of.Overall I honestly suggest this game even though it's in early access. It is not one to miss if you are in love with the era or if you are naval fanatic like I am. If not and are hoping to dabble into the genre, this is a great start - the game is forgiving to new players & the community is willing to help teach you the basics.			"

								My review - From my experience in the early alphaFirst of all i wish to state that the community of the game has been amazing and the developers have been listening very well to us. I have been following this game ever since early 2014 and it's grown to a very enjoyable game.PLEASE NOTE: This game is not made for the impatientThe game requires atleast a decent interest in ship combat and sailing, you need to navigate yourself, the combat is made realistically. It is not an arcade, note that if you just want to kill, kill, kill this game won't be a good game for you.First of all, the graphics look fantastic. Probably the best looking game I've ever seen in the Unity engine. The Open world currently does look a little worse than the battles, but this is understandable for performance reasons. The game runs decently, haven't had any issues to achieve a solid 60FPS. Yet the dev's stated they would improve performance in the future so no worries about that.The ships are beautiful and detailed, just look up the trincomalee in the game, and irl. It looks identical. Honestly amazing how detailed the ships have become. I hope to see more crew on deck in the future. More activites there would be nice.The sound design is AMAZING, it sounds like you are actually in an 18th century sea battle, the smoke really adds to the battles aswell. Couldn't be more perfect.Overall the battles feel very complete already, it is the open world which does require a bit of work. Of course, the UI can be confusing at first, and it does not look the greatest. It is not the priority, and we understand this. The UI is something to improve on definitely. Another negative thing about the game is that there is currently no tutorial. So finding out what to do can be a bit tricky at first. So please use the help chat in game, someone almost instantly helps you on there.The open world is a WIP and that is clearly visible, and this is most likely where the developers will focus on in Early Acces, so you will mostly see that progress.Overall, I bought the game on a Thursday and within a week I had played over 100 hours. A recommendation for sure, dedicated dev's, good communication with the community. Best Naval game out there right now!			"

								First off, I must say that I have been called a “Fan boy” many times.  However, I seek to give an honest review that contains the good and the bad, so that people know what they are getting into, and whether the price tag is right for them.FeaturesAuthentic Age of sail naval combat game that blends realism and gameplay for an enjoyable and unique experience.  Era of game:  mid 1700s to the 1820s.  It is not a sim.  It is not an arcade.  It is not fully realistic nor fully historical, but a blend of all these.  Authentic and Addicting Combat SystemNaval Action features one of the most beautiful and authentic Age of Sail combat systems to date.  Every cannonball, every wave, and many parts of the ships are all tracked to see where the ball hits.  Accuracy is not based upon rng or a magical skill number but actual gunnery, which is your own ability to judge the following three things:  the distance between you and the target, the characteristics of your smoothbore cannons, and the pitching and rolling of your ship through the waves.  I don’t know if this is well known or not, but I have hit the wheel of enemy ships and seen their ship go into “rudder shock,” which means they cannot turn.No artifical skillsThere are no skills to artificially train.  Instead of training skills at level up, you yourself have to get better at the game.  Whether it is knowing when, how and where to maneuver in battle, your ability to process the tactical situation, your own personal skill at gunnery, the way you position your ship while under cannon fire, or your ability to navigate the world, this game is all about how good you, your friends, and your enemies are. Your hand is not held by the game, but you will find the community is typically helpful if you have questions on how to do something.Open World (OW)Explore a massive world that would take weeks to fully explore.  It is time compressed because otherwise it would take days of real time sailing just to go between ports, let alone the weeks needed to cross the Caribbean.  How it is right now, it takes 4-12+ hours of real time sailing to cross the map.  Travel can be long.  Local knowledge of the area, the channels, shallows, and hiding spots are all vital. However, at the moment, the islands can seem a little boring beyond the majestic views.  There is dynamic weather and you can get lost, especially in storms and heavy fog.  Venturing out of sight of land for the first time can be a little intimidating.  MapThere is a very rough ingame map that shows the ports.  The devs plan to beautify the map once UI is decided upon.  There is no “You are Here” marker.  You will have to keep track of that yourself.  Navigation is a skill you will want to learn if you want to venture outside the Arena.  It is extremely daunting at first but easy to pick up.  Soon you will be pretty good at it.  The map lacks navigation tools.Battle InstancesBecause every shot, every wave, and detailed parts of the ships are all tracked by the server, battles have to be instanced. Instances can have up to 50 ships, whether they are small cutters or ships of the line.  Shallows and land do not appear in battle yet but is planned.Realistic Sailing ModelSailing in the battle instances is fairly realistic and authentic. To tack properly (turn through the wind), you have to learn manual sailing. Easy to pick up, fairly easy to master. It becomes second nature, like learning manual shift in vehicle.  UIBattle Instance UI is pretty good in my opinion. I am a minimalist when it comes to UI. I don’t want all the extra crap blocking my view of the beautiful ships and environment. The Open World and Port UI are horrible (tech demo). I wish Game Labs would have spent a week polishing it a little before Early Access. The UI will be finished later. They don’t want to spend a lot of time working on something that will have to be redone in the future.Economy and CraftingThe economy and crafting is basic, but every time I turn around, something new has been added and fleshed out. Don’t fall into the pitfall of buying crafting resources from NPC ports and selling them to NPCs. Sell to players or build your own stuff to sell. That is where the money is. Crafting and trading takes time, experience, and a lot of gold, but the payout is good.Boarding CombatThere are no avatars.  You cannot walk about your ship.  When you board the enemy, a tactical mini game appears.  Some people compare it to Rock Paper Scissors.  Some like it, some hate it, I think it is fine.  If this is a deal breaker, watch YouTube first before you buy.PVEThere is Player Vs Environment (AI).  The AI can be difficult at first, even very difficult.  But they soon become easy and boring once you get to know them.  There is a pve only server if you don't want to play against players.PVPThis is where the heart of the game is. Expect Ganks. Expect great 1v1 fights. Expect on-the-edge-of-your-seat group fights, where teamwork and skill is needed to clutch victory from defeat. This is the addicting part of the game.Port Battles:Right now port battles only consist of a few towers that you have to destroy along with any player defenders that show up. There is no land yet or proper forts, but these are being worked on.  A successful port assault will change the current owner to your nation.  Do not open player outposts in national ports except the capital city. All other national ports can be captured and you will lose access to anything in the port until it is recaptured. Port captures are way too frequent (negative).ArenaThere is an arena option available.Technically you never have to access the open world if you don't want to. Battle seems daunting at first, but in the Arena you can practice in a low stress environment with the free basic ships. Combat is easy to get the hang, very difficult to master.  ProgressionYou start with a small cutter.You can progress to a ship of the line.The progression can be long.  Just pvp and have fun; no need to grind. You will get into the larger ships in due time and you will want to learn the game first. This game is all about the process.Forget the end game. If you get to the end game without learning the game you will cry when your extremely expensive ship ends up on the bottom of the ocean or in someone else’s dock. If you grind, it isnt any worse than WoWS.PriceThe price is expensive for an early access game. But in my opinion, it is very worth it. At almost 2000 hours, I have paid about 2 cents an hour to play Naval Action.StabilityEven though the game is Early Access, I haven't had any crashes in almost a year. It is very stable on my machine. There are annoying bugs from time to time and very rarely something is wrong with the server. Other people report crashes but those are usually people who don't meet the minimum requirements. People do report fps problems. People say the game is poorly optimized, but with a 980 ti, I get 70-100fps on Open World and typically 100+ fps in battle.  I play on 1920x1080 and ultra.You only get 1 character per serverNegatives/needs work/I dream of:No crew managementOW and Port UIPort Battles are a new feature and are still very roughNo land in battlesNo navigation tools where your skill as a navigator mattersOnly Basic clan features.Port Captures are way too frequentOW needs some little details to make it varied and interestingNo built in tutorials or manualNo reputation system yetPositivesBattles are amazingAddicting pvpRealistic sailing modelWell developed damage modelBeautiful shipsLearning curve means you are always learning new things.

Early Access Review
								The game is garbage.Aside from all the players with more game time than me telling of how the developers themselves play the game and cheat and how it is all turned into one ♥♥♥♥♥♥, unrealistic fast travel simulator/grief simulator, this game just simply offers nothing that it actually gives off the vibe that it does in its promos. It is a sham like No Man's Sky. I bought the game because I thought there'd be realistic maritime battles and features. Over half of the game mechanics meant to provide realism are broken are just plain wrong. I want to patrol the seven seas and capture pirates and smugglers. This never happens. There are no opprotunities for player interaction or roleplay. The only player interaction that occurs is griefing. The game presents itself as a hardcore player's dream maritime sim but is sadly just an open world where players can sail around accomplishing absolutely nothing until they decide to fast travel to a mission to earn so gold or whatever. Then they get massacred by the OP pirates or griefed to death by the rediculously OP pirates. Nothing else happens in this game. I even joined a clan with the hopes of getting more out of the game in terms of strategy, teamwork, and immersive gameplay. Everyone who had been playing for months longer than me finally gave up and quit because the game lost all of its direction and is going nowhere. There is nothing to be gained from playing this game. If you like hardcore games and historical sims, then just play empire total war and have fun with the naval engagements there. They have better mechanics and are far more entertaining. Aside from pretty graphics, naval action has nothing to offer. LITERALLY. It is an unfinished piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥that is not likely to ever be finished soon because the developers would rather♥♥♥♥♥♥around and pander to trolls to promote the game and make a quick buck.			"

								I've been playing Naval action for a bit now. I'd like to say that I could endorse this pretty looking game but I can't.There are quite a few unsavory elements to the game. And here's a few.1. Unrealistic and overpowered AI.The NPC ships in the game routinely break nearly EVERY sailing rule of physics in the book, maneuvering like hydrofoils even in a headwind. And if THAT isn't bad enough, their gunnery puts even present day warships with their guided missiles to shame with a near 90% hit rate even at extreme range with maybe 2 out of every 3 hits landing criticals. Also they seem to have a higher rate of fire than most players.The devs DID recently reduce the AI accuracy on small ships such as cutters and brigs hoping that less experienced players won't notice that all frigates and SoTLs still have the ""sniper elite"" level AI and dance around like fairies.2. Toxic and hostile player community.The game is supposed in alpha stage, which means that people playing the game are supposed to be providing feedback and making suggestions. However the player community will usually try to shout down player suggestions, throw insults and name-calling around, and attempt to derail the suggestion thread by leading it off topic into wild and immature tangents. They also seem to celebrate on the forums when frustrated players announce their intention to leave <like good riddance or don't let the door hit you in the *** on the way out, etc>.3. Devs alienate PvE and Independent players.With only a single PvE server and no access to alt characters if you want to experience something new, for example playing another nation or just plain want to play a new character they give you only 2 options either completely delete your old character and make an entirely new one sacrificing all your gold, ships, crafting resources and all that even though you still retain both your rank and crafting xp or be forced onto a PvP server where only 3 of their 7 or 8 playable nations are even viable and where ganking and griefing runs rampant.They claim that this is designed to prevent economic exploitation but that kind of exploitation already exists in the game in the form of the current guild activity.4. They are setting the stage for total disaster for the game economy and solo playability with their future economic goals.In their most recent patch they did away with player ability to sail captured warships. Instead players now have to auto turn in warships they have captured in boarding combat over to their respective nation's admiralties for a tiny sum of gold and only allowing players to commandeer merchant ships. They also have future plans to completely do away with NPC resource vendors and allowing players to have the complete run of the economy. This action coupled with the canned ability to sail captured warships will inevitably open the door to massive overpricing of ships, and other items and make it impossible for any independent player to survive and be competitive.It's like Pirates of the Burning Sea all over again.....Perhaps even worse.At least portalus games has since begun to offer means of solo player survivability (if only to line their own pockets with real-world cash).With this all said I can not in good conscience recommend this game to anyone.

								This is the BEST Age of Sail game you will ever play!Yes there are issues, yes this is EA and the game changes every 2 months, yes it can be bitter to loose everything you worked for. But please ignore all the salty tears of people who don't understand the concept of early access.The devs are constantly working on their product. And I have to say this is one of the few EAs where they actually really listen to us testers and are in constant dialogue with us.I'm enjoying this game and I really hope that the Devs will have an overwhelmingly successful launch!Btw, the content in form of new ships is just amazing. Every model is just beautiful and fun to sail!Keep up the good work guys! "

								This game looked amazing, and I've never really had a bad experience with early access games, having bought Space engineers and Factorio, plus I love sailing, that's why I bought itMy problems are:-40 follars for an early access, totally unreasonable-There are no tutorials or anything for how to combat (I'm not necessarily talking about in-game tutorials), so you either get the hang of the strategy or you don't. And if you don't, you're gonna have a bad time. -Missions are repetitive, and if you want to do anything else you have to sail for hours to get somewhere. Very ******* exciting.-Progress is slow. Like really slow. In 11 hours I haven't even got a little close to getting my first ship after the default one.-I kinda hoped that the future updates would somehow fix the game, but all we've got were bug fixes and minor changes 8n the combat system.Right now I just want my money back.

								Ive put about 160 hours into this game over the course of development. The devs are very responsive to the community and work to provide a truly unique sailing experience.Even as a player with limited time to play, I immensely enjoyed every bit of my time in it. From starting out in the smallest of cutters, to duking it out with broadsides from a ship of the line.Think of this game as an EVE Online in the Age of Sail. Its not an arcadey sea shooter, and it will require patience, perseverence, and learning before you can truly master the seas.This game easily makes it in my Top 5 Games Ever Played. (And its still not finished)			"

Great game, even better with friends, and if you don't have any friends you'll make some real quick because the community and clan system are great.It does have a learning curve, but there are so many great youtube videos and guides so you will never get stuck.

								From late 2016, the game has become more and more frustrating to play. There is still no build in compass to set your heading by, the only thing we've gotten is a grid labeler. Economy is absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥ When the open Alpha came out, the strongest class of ship, a 1st rate, with the highest level, cost about 3 million gold. 3 million gold will get you a Frigate now, maybe at least. If you are new, you won't be able to afford any new ship, and nobody will buy the things you craft, if you want to craft, as the level 50 crafters can sell stuff way cheaper than you could to make a profit. The entire game is at a standstill, nothing is changing, nothing can change. DO NOT BUY.			"

Early Access Review
								NOTICE:  This is a Early Access Review.By the time of this writing I have played 894 hours in this game, and one of the leading commanders of the Dutch Antilies Squadron.  I've enjoyed this game a lot through it's development and progress, however, you need to know about this game before you get into it.  Spend a week or two reading the fourms, watching videos on YouTube and such, and you should be well aware what this game is about before you perchase it.  Naval Action is a beautiful and entertaining game with a mostly decent community, therefore, you should want to know what you are getting into before getting it.This game is not fully fleshed out yet, and many features are still yet to be developed, such as a port UI, official in-game diplomacy, proper economy, and provisions.  Development with the game is slow, and requries patience. This review is not about the individual features of the game, but how this game is largerly operated by most of the community.Naval Action is an Open World Naval Combat game.  The game's era is between 1750 and 1820, therefore, this is not a galleon, sea-dogs and pirate game.  Instead, it is more of a game of national sepremacy from the Seven Years War to the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic era.  Right now, the map is the Carribean, Gulf of Mexico and lower seaboard of the American coastline,  but don't be dismayed, it's plenty big enough right now, as it will take hours to sail from one side of the map to the other.This game is not a game where you can log in an expect a quick and decent battle however.  Battles themselves can take 30 minutes easily, and not to mention the amount of time looking for a target to attack.  If you want to play this game properly, you need to set aside an entire afternoon.Most of the real fun in this game are the large national fleets fighting for conquest.  These are largely operated by organizations, for example The Decatur Armada and Tattered Flags for the Americans, the Sea Lords Royal Navy for the British, Enfants du Roy for the French, and the Dutch Antillies Squadron for the Dutch (as well as many other groups, more information for them are on the Naval Action fourms).  Most of these organizations opperate off of a TeamSpeak 3 server to allow for communications.  Some are more strict than others, and is up to your prefernce.  These organizations however will try their best to help you through the ranks and teach you all the qualities of seamanship you need for Naval Action. The real excitement are the large ship battles that will occur as rival nations clash with each other on their borders in large battles for sepremacy in the Caribbean.But yet again, people need to be aware that war is not fair.  If you sail away from areas protected by your nation, you are a free target for any other nation or player to attack you, fairly or not.The fact is, the most important decision that you will ever have in this game is which faction you are going to pick at the very start. Some factions are easy due to the sheer number of players, like the British and the Pirates due to their sheer numbers, while others are thrown in the middle of the most contested waters in the game, such as the Danes, Swedes and the French.  Spain will forever be a target for the more expanively minded nations until they get a population, while the Americans and Dutch will be cursed in the early game due their lack of ports and resources.  Currently, there is not official diplomacy implemented between the nations and all are theoretically at war.  Diplomacy is largely crated by the player organizations.  For example, the Dutch and the Danish organizations are allied with each other, even though theoretically they are at war with each other in the game.  Therefore, it is wize to learn about which organizations are allied with which, and which ones are at war.In conclusion, at the current state of the game, and particularly on the PvP server, the best way to treat this game is a battle for National Sepremacy.  Each nation has its own story: the Swedes, a story of survival; the Spanish, a story of prevervation; the Americans, a story of expansion; the British, a story of sepremacy; the Danes, a story of progress; the French, a story of unity; the Dutch, a story of achievement; and the Pirates, a story about too much rum and watching the world burn.  These nations may or may not achieve the stories the way that they wish, but they are the vital core of the game right now.  It is these nations and the people that follow them that make this game what it is.			"

								Grindiest game I've ever played. Also the nonexistent tutorial and bad UI basically means you are guessing your way through the game to do simple tasks. I just ragequit after I realized I was completely outclassed by a player, despite putting in the time to read and watch unofficial guides, videos. Because in the end I was still winging it as far as the combat goes since there is no consistent information that basically goes ""HERE IS WHAT YOU DO"". You are more or less thrown into the deep end when it comes to the combat. Some people will say that's a good thing or ""hardcore game blah blah"" or ""its in alpha!"", but that's just a good way to end up with a dead game. Which is what this will probably become			"

								Good! But Slow. I'm not opposed to a 'grind' in a MMO.  I like when games make you work for it, and you have something  to strive for.  This game does that well when it comes to ships, and levels.  What I mean by slow, is the combat itself.  Sure you can destroy a small ship with a large ship with ease, but when it takes 20 minutes for a group of players to kill one large ship, it's just silly, and feels like a big waste of time.  The biggest pain point is that when you destroy a side of a ship, it WILL sink.  There is nothing they, or you can do about it.  You can slow the death by going into survival mode, but death is inevitable.  So my question is. WHY NOT JUST SINK ALREADY! You cannot accelerate the sinking any faster.  If the armor is down on the ship, and you keep hitting the ship, it doesn't matter at all.  Just pound away for 3 minutes and the inevitable happens, or just turn sail and ride away and wait for it to sink.  JUST SINK, EXPLODE, DIE!  The combat is good.  High skill based shooting, and strategy.  I've been playing solo, so it's not been nearly as fun as it would be with friends, like most games.  I do see a lack of end game in the current state of the game.  You pretty much progress in ships and xp for it's own sake.  The only end game I see is either just disrupting other countries with groups of players killing them, or taking ports, which is difficult, but relatively boring.Players of POTBS or BBO will see a lot of resemblence in this game, although this game seems more shallow, with less to do.  The boarding function is clicking what you want to do, not actually doing it.  No 'adventure' type thing.  No land based gameplay at all. (granted that was pretty lame in POTBS but it did add depth. Land combat which was boarding combat, farming, gathering ect.)Community is solid enough.  Lots of questions get answered pretty quickly, and you will have LOTS of questions your first week.  I'd definitely reccommend it if you are playing with friends, and hopefully the devs will come out with some more engaging things in the future, rather than running boring/slow missions, and fighting fleets for the sake of fighting fleets.  PvP is good, and fun, but also rather meaningless unless you go out and hunt players which will not be worth any kind of reward for the most part.			"

								I used to love this game, I played countless hours grinding so I could join my clanmates in port battles, which were quite enjoyable. I participated in the weeks long Aves campaign from the British side, this campaign started as gudfights of ships of the line and degenerated into the enemy yoloing cheap, big ships (Constitutions) into our ships of the line to sink them for minimal effort. This was due to the fact that the devs broke the damage scale for ramming, go figure. That particular update kept many 2nd and 1st rates in ports for some time because people were too scared of losing them to a yolo-ram, and for good reason.The community varies from useful to toxic, most unaffiliated players are toxic, useless, trolls, alt accounts from a player of another nation, or a mix of anything previously stated. Speaking of which, alt account abuse is rampant. Get ready for some sorry neckbeard to ruin your day by doing some dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥in a default ship.I have not played this game again until recently due to news of the upcoming wipe. I am now cautiously returning because I do not wish to invest too much time in a game I am incredibly skeptical about.With all of that said, here are the pros and cons! Notice the effort I put into cons, take that into consideration.Pros:Amazing sailing and combat mechanics - there is no better sailing ship battle game out thereAccurate models and ship handlingCons:The devs are absolute ♥♥♥♥ing mongs and only know how to make extreme decisions. They refuse to make gradual changes to see how things go. Instead they go balls to the wall and completely overhaul some system because 4 people on the forum complained about something.Very slow game to play, get ready to invest a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of time into the game before you get to do anything fun. I didn't have the level to crew a 3rd Rate Ship of the Line until roughly 300 hours in, but I did take a little bit of a long way to get there.The Pirate Nation is broken - they get all of the benefits of being a nation such as location bonuses to skills, trade, ship building, etc. while retaining the ability to be a massive middle finger to anything and everything. Get ready to have your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ christened by a big ol group of pirates, because it's going to happen, a lot.			"

								If there was ever a game with so much potential, it'd be Naval Action.  By far and away the best sailing experience you will get out of a computer game. The finer parts of what the Devs have accomplished thus far would certainly be the optimization and multiplayer integration. Both of these two key features make the game a pleasure to play both alone and with others. The ship combat is amazing, firing a broadside into an enemy ship's hull is one of the most satisfying things in the game. The sound of the cannons is perfect and you can hear them roll out across the water like they should. The ships themselves are marvelous to look at and the scenery around them is wonderful. The only gripes I have with the game are the boarding experience is a bit lacking at the moment and the UI is underwhelming however the Devs have stated that it is only temporary. The game overall is wonderful to play and I would highly recommend the game if you are into the age of sail.			"

								This is one of the best games I have ever played, hands down. I started a year ago in Sea Trials and recently came back to it while sparingly playing in between.If you are a fan of simulation then you'll absolutely love the game due to the physics of sailing and combat. While the game isn't fully fleshed out in terms of ""content"" it makes up for it by the skill cap of fighting, for me at least. There is a great feeling once you understand the mechanics of sailing and put them into action. The game has an incredible open world at the time of review and it is ever changing as nations control and fight over territory. The graphics are beautiful with small details like cabin lights at night reflecting off of the water, waves, and the horizon.Whether you are a sandbox enthusiast or you enjoy quick battles queue style (they have these too!) I would fully recommend picking this game up as there is depth to the combat which is rewarding if you stick with it.			"

The ships are pure beautiful, so are the peaceful waves, and the rain, I could listen to that all day. The amount of detail ships have in battle is just outstanding.I'd recommend this game to anyone. In my opinion, it's a must have. It may be in early access with little content, but it sure does pack a lot of fun in its current state. I'd gladly give it so far a 10/10.			"

								What this game should have been is an open world sandbox that immersed you for hours. It certainly isn't that yet. (Still early access)This is what happens when you employ very talented modellers and don't bother spending any time thinking about gameplay mechanics. It looks absolutely beautiful but after a couple of hours sailing around looking at your pretty ship and fighting other players, you realize there really isn't anything else to hold your interest.I hope the developers can bring in new people with the talent to turn this game into a proper sandbox, and this is still early access so it's still possible, but if they are openly discussing starting a kickstarter just to fix bugged ships it sounds like they are running out of funds. Seems more likely this will go the same way as many early access titles. Hopefully I'm wrong and it can meet it's undoubted potential but can't recommend yet.			"

								Game died with unprofessional devs that don't know what they want. So players left the game.Every now and then they announced a bucket full of nonsense-ideas for this game at one evening and reply in a way you would expect from drunk people. So don't expect these announcements to be real, no, they are just ideas to upset the whole community that is left. The morning after most responses by devs are deleted or modified. Don't waste your money on this. Gameidea was in the beginning great, but my hopes that it would become a great finished game are gone. Not with these devs!			"

								Although being in Early Access, Naval Action has a very good foundation upon which the game is being built upon. They started with the very basics by first developing, fleshing out and testing the combat module years ago. It is clear that this is where Naval Action shines.It's not a true simulator by any means, however, it takes whatever realism it can and molds it into a fantastic gameplay experience. Sailing mechanics such as manually controlling the yards is extremely fun and rewarding as your maneuvering the battlefield trying to line up a perfect broadside. Constantly keeping an eye on the direction of the wind, the angle of your yards, the angle and direction of your targets yards and ship. Outmaneuvering your opponent can be a truly rewarding experience and most definitely will help you in coming out on top and surviving a battle.The 'overworld', or 'open world' part of Naval Action is very much so a work-in-progress. However, it shows us the potential of Naval Action as a large-scale war between multiple nations trying to outsmart eachother through stategical prowess and manipulating the political landscape. Naval Action has a long way to go but it has shown us that the concept works, beautifully so, and they plan to make it so much better.Albeit a tad bit pricey for being an Early Access game, I personally believe it to be one of the best we've seen thus far. So if you like the Age of Sail in general, perhaps the masterpiece film 'Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World', the great series 'Black Flag', you might want to check out this game.			"

								The Flash of light, a billow of smoke, and the crash of splintering wood! Naval Action is an Amzing Age of Sail sandbox world! The map is HUGE! reaching from halfway up the United States Caost, all the way down to the north shore of South America!  The Islands are so accuratly mapped, if you get lost you can compare the island's shape to a map and find wehre you are! =oDGameplay: The ships have a nice balance between action and simulation. Wind profile and hull design are taken into account... and improving all the time as the game devlops. Available nations to sail for are; USA, Britain, France, Denmark, Holland, Spain, Sweeden, and of course... Pirates!Combat: Can get very intesise! The ships handle well in combat and can be sunk or caprtured in battle, and via several difernt methods! =oDComunity / Moderators; Ive been playign this game sicne it began in closed alpha... these guys in game are some of the funnest and funniest players around! Ever group has some bad apples but the Moderators are active and take thier role seriously... which keeps the community happy and having fun. I consider them to be the best iI've ever dealt with.   Pros: Immersive sandbox world of immense proportions! Good sounds. Good variety of ships to buy/craft/steal. Ecconomics for those who want to be a trader captain. Fun and lively group, most of whom respect skilled players and are very noob friendly. Port battles for the war mongerers... stealing ships for the pirate inclined fellows. Arr har har!   Cons: Still some growing pains in combat mechanics, some things get out of balance. The ability to have AI ships escorting players dilutes the PVP experience.Over all 4/5, and likely to improve with age.			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, do not buy this game. I know it looks awesome, but it's not. Now lets get into the reasons why.GAMEPLAYI had originally been watching this game since before the open world was created. It looked incredible. I thought this was the game I had been dreaming about for ages. I bought it as soon as it became available on steam; however, life got in the way and I never really had a chance  to play it until half a year later.  At first, I thought the game was great. However, I soon realized that this WAS NOT the game I had been watching for almost a year. First, I was thrown into a poorly designed open world system that slows every aspect of the game down. I had no idea how to get started or what to do. Thankfully, the community was there for me. As I slowly (and I can't emphasize slowly enough) worked my way up to larger ships, I became increasingly annoyed. Where was the huge PVP combat? Where were all the other players? When do I get to fight a ship that isn't a bot? All of this was supposed to exist in the game, but didn't. Granted, I sometimes saw allied players, and I had also encountered gank squads composed of high level players camping outside ports. But I never saw any of the real PVP combat I had drooled over on youtube. In the current build of the game, You will spend 90% of the time sailing, 5% in port, and 5% fighting incredibly overpowered bots that will hit your boat ship no matter how far you are away. PVP is a joke, simply because there is none. Henceforth, I shall refer to the game as Naval Inaction, as that should be it's proper title.UPDATESIn Naval Inaction, updates are unreliable. The devs refuse to listen to the community, WHICH IS CRITICAL in an early access niche game like this. Instead, the devs continue to pursue their idea of what the game should be. The only problem is they don't know what their game should be, or where to go from here, so they keep pushing out updates that don't focus on anything specifically, so nothing is ever fixed. The community of this game has several great ideas of where the game could go from here. Unfortunately, however, the community is almost never listened to, and so Naval Inaction continues to remain in limbo, progressing nowhere while experiencing a steady decline in player population.The devs also are also known to release unreliable information about upcoming patches. For instance, a gamewide shipwipe was announced in late 2016. The devs claimed the wipe would occur in December or January, but no wipe has happened yet. To my knowledge, the devs have not released any information about this failure. EDIT: The devs released information about the shipwipe on the community hub two hours before the time of this edit. DEVELOPER ABUSE/CENSORSHIP""Sensorship reflects a society's lack of confidence in itself""Potter Stewart""The first condition of progress is the removal of censorship""George Bernard ShawIf you have read other steam reviews, many players are accusing the devs of censorship on the Gamelabs forums. Some reviews provide proof of censorship. While I personally have not experienced censorship, I feel I must bring up this topic. Developer censorship of differing opinions is a serious problem. In my opinion, people who have purchased this game (which is not a cheap) have a right to express their views freely. The developers have a responsibility to respect and listen to their playerbase, not throw it in the back of the closet. Without the players, afterall, the developers would have nothing. If the developers truely care about their product they must respect the rights of those who purchased it. This is why I think the Developers DO NOT CARE  about their product any longer. The game has gone nowhere for almost 3/4ths of a year, despite several updates. At this point, I feel the game has been abandonded and the devs are hoping people will continue buying the game. This is essentially fraud, but the devs avoid this by providing low-effort patches every few months. Naval Inaction is seemingly nothing more than a scam at this point in time.CONCLUSIONDo not buy this game. It is not worth the price, and the developers do not deserve the money due to the behavior they exhibit towards the community. If you really feel you must buy this game, buy it, leave a negetive review, then refund it.			"

								Well, a friend has been going about this for some time, and being a fan of wooden ships myself finally got to try it.WOW. This, this is a really great find for fans of the era, or just looking for something different. Some things you must have a basic understanding of before you play.. or you will be really frustrated... You will / can learn but better to admit to yourself what level you are before rage quiting.. take that frustration and learn how.. its not so hard.1. Real compass to map navigation. There are no giant quest guides. No mini map route to use. You have a map. You have a compass. Terms like S by SE begin to come clear.  If your in the deep water, landmarks dont exist.  You have your compass, the sun and you have to think about how long you have been sailing and speed.2. Sails / tacking etc.. The physics are pretty good in what I have seen. Fortunately you do have wind direction available on your compass.. a little knowledge of sails goes a looooong way.  Also remember.. these vessels dont stop, accelerate or turn on a dime. It takes the crew a moment to make sail changes also.Combat is really well done. Cannons, various ammo types of the time, shipboard musket fire.. boarding.. The tide is with us, the wind fair, cast off!			"

								This game had potential, but so did the Titanic... for more than $5 I wouldn't recommend taking the risk.While the game has its ups and downs, the development feels more like its taking shots in the dark than actually making progress. Interestingly enough this game has some of the best and worst customer relations I have ever seen. The developers are very active on the forums, both steam and otherwise, however, I'd guess that half of that time is spent arguing with players and/or forum naziing 'unpopular' ideas or threads. I'm not saying the customer is always right but when the developers make a forum thread about a review calling them out on being hostile and vindictive is that not proving the reviewers point? Of course, then you have the completely out of touch updates, encouraging cowardly exploits. You have a problem with people hiding from combat in the battle results screen (which is easy to get without actually fighting) so you give people the option to magically teleport to safety after a fight? What is wrong with you? Do you play your own game? The level of absurdity is astounding... ""we're going to fix this exploit by making all the nagative aspects of it a feature instead'... please, give up programming and get honestly dishonest jobs like pickpocketing or mugging.			"

								As someone who just started in this game and has a very good idea of how to play and is now faced with a major wipe coming up in april causing me to lose most of my ships,gold and items (besides xp) here is my opinion. First, if your planning to get the game i would wait until after april 20th, this is when the wipe will be done and the servers back open again. You might not want to buy now and invest time just to lose your stuff in a few weeks. <-- nothing against the game but i am trying to help new or soon to be new players out in the frustation department. Review of the game itself:Naval action has to be one of the best age of sail games on the market right now. Graphics=Unbeatable...Gameplay=Immersive/entertaining  Realism and Historical ships=Included. This game has to be one of the most edge of your seat age of sail games ever, between tradeing port to port hopeing pirates dont spot your ship to intense port and massive ship battles to one on one broadsides with high detail cannon fire this game has the makings of a amazing naval game with all the goodies you want. Mind you...Makeings...This is a keyword, currently the game is in alpha, before you buy...PLEASE understand what this means! This means, nothing is guarenteed. Your hard earned work, your gold your ships and XP could all be taken away in a wipe to improve the game. The game is in development and wipes are needed to make this game better before final relieace. if your someone who will be sore having your 10 million dollar ship taken from you in a wipe you may not want to pick this game up until it is finished. Personally, i enjoy the game. i enjoy the battles and the sailing i enjoy having to use the map cordinate points to sail since their is no waypoints or navagation help in the game. I enjoy working hard and being told ""hey, we are going to make this better for you, we know ____ is causeing you to grind for xp let us wipe and make this better and more enjoyable."" i like being apart of a game whos devs literally have a thread open all the time for you to post complaints or issues. I like to see the devs comment on threads that are related to the game. But hey, having your stuff taken from you isnt for everyone. Please think about this before buying this game i give it a 8.0 out of 10 even as a alpha currently, but think about if a wipe would make you upset. or a learning curve to even play the game first.

								     Naval Action is a completely new experience, a game of this scale and type hasn't been attempted at development for a long while after games such as Sea Dogs II (Later on bought by Disney and renamed to Pirates of the Caribbean) and so far a great product has come of it. Game-Labs have a team of very talented and dedicated people, which unlike many they are very community driven, you will see them answering questions and taking part of pretty much all forum posts. Overall this game has the potential to become a lot. So don't be disappointed if there's things missing, instead log into the forums and help out and this game can become something very special. I've been helping with testing and development like many others for over a year and I can say that this game has changed A LOT and very quickly. All the little things have been looked after by Game-Labs so that the game works and so that it is balanced for everyone to enjoy. So far I have loved my experience and I know that many of you will.              Regards                   -TheMarineGamerRemember, in this world, it's your choice, it's your path and do whatever you like because the game lets you do so!So if you don't like the fact you need to use common sense to know where you are and use visual landmarks, or if you think that the game is too hard, then instead of trying to change this one, just play games that are already like that, such as POTBS. Because this game im afraid is just for the other 'minority'. And we're loving it, same goes for Elite Dangerous!			"

								IMPORTANT: If you're someone who likes to get into a game and play it just fine, this isn't for you. Maybe because it's early access, but to understand everything, you'll need to look up stuff on the game official forum or ask on the steam forum ( who has a very low population compared to the real forum tho ).The game is very well made for an early access, I've owned this game since it's very very early access where you purchased it on their website and they sent keys by wave. There's a lot going on and the game mechanics are very good. But it's really ''realistic'', it's not an arcade kind of game like how you fight with ships in black flag, so if you're into that instead of something more up to par with real life standards, I'd recommend you skip this game.The graphics are very good & I never had any lag ( playing this game on a 560M than on a 960 ), obviously there are some bugs, but it's pretty good looking so far.The only thing that is a downer ( for me at least ), is the price tag, 55$ CAD is fairly expensive for an early access game, and I feel it may pose problems for future sales.

								(UPDATE: Just avoid like the plaugue. Planned microtransactions, premium ships only for mods and admins, and rich kids who can buy the other premium ships. Requests to downvote reviews, closing topics, banning users and REMOVING PLANNED CONTENT because of an unhappy playerbase. These guys are among the worst developers in the business. This experiement of a game has failed, time to wait for the next big hope, run by people that actually care about the community)In the time I played I never felt a connection to anything. Big wide open spaces, npc ships. It felt like a lot of effort to go somewhere that looks and feels the same as every other spot. The water was not exciting. No big battles with giant whitecapping waves, rocking the ships, making you fight the waves and time your shots. Instead it feels arcady. Still fun, but lacking those moments of intense excitment and real skill that mother nature randomly provides. Wind should change during battle... why remove reality, when it would be a solid addition to the gameplay mechanics?I love that you can see the shore now in battle, and use it as a tool. This makes the wind direction actually important (wind that changed direction could be a real challange). Remaining in aiming view when looking around that ship would really help keep the immersion in battle, but instead looking around to get your bearings is penalized with a game mechanic that is a little jolting. What I would give for life to be in the ocean and land to look at as I walk along the line of my ship, maybe even enter my cabin, as the men run about taking care of the ship. Important things to keep the immersion, as most of the time in the game is spent in transition from one place to another. Instead we can only look at a stripped down version of our actual ship, dead seas, and calm sailing, with storms so weak they are easily missed. There is potential here, the question is: will it be realised? I think it is imporant for developers to listen to the community and seriously consider if they are doing the right thing or not.			"

								Ah Naval action. So much wasted potential. So many wasted customers. But I suppose once you get their money it doesn't matter. This game peaked and is declining in a player base because there was really no endgame in this MMO. Grind like crazy to the biggest ships then the devs change the rules on you. Bye bye player base. This game is very hard to casually play, it takes tons of time. It wasn't always like that. This to date, is the game that I've sunk the most hours into (not counting my gaming hours from the pre-Steam days). Perhaps the devs have in some ways leaned too much towards realism and forgot about fun. I love what this game should be but it's nothing without a large player base. I really don't know if i would recommend this game at this point. Steam makes me choose a thumbs up or a down so I'm going to give it a down because of the dissapointment it has caused me. It hurts me to say this but I would probably skip this game as it is now. If it was a single player game that didn't rely on the player base I would say it's worth the buy. :(			"

Its just grinding and grinding and grinding and I felt like I was getting nowhere.The battle mechanics are beautiful but the UI is the worst I have ever seen from a game at this price.Ship boarding is just some UI and no actual action to be seen.About the devs, I've never interacted with them myself but based on what I've seen and heard they completely neglect the majority of their community but the players in game are actually quite pleasant people and very helpfulI will not ever reccomend this game unless it improves.

								I really wanted to love this game, I have 500 hours of open world play and I am a long time vet of POTBS, however the biggest issue with this game is the attitude of the developers and their ""veteran"" forum/game supporters , being just one big echo chamber on whatr direction the game should take. The vast majority of the vocal players are ""reality"" obsessed,  they really belive that they are real sailors and they have no perspective on the fact that it is and being sold as a video game, not a simulator and thus they are obsessed with making the game as boring and unintuitive as possible in the name of being a ""challange"", from no world map to ai ships so few and far between that you spend most of your time sitting out to sea 1000 yards away from port waiting for enemy ships to appear and the devs answer to needing more ai ships is that the want to maintain a sense of realism and make it a ""special experience"" when you finally see a enemy ship, all this would be fine if you had somthing else to do to level up. All and all solid battle mechanic and a complete fail at being a MMO in every way shape and form.			"

								What was once a promising Naval Sim...  Lead by Devs out of touch.... Has left everyone with a sour taste in their mouths.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR ANY GAME THESE GUYS EVER PRODUCE AGAIN! They only care about their EU players. Even though USA was 40% of sales.  Unless you want to play at 3-5am for territory....  A big middle finger to these guys.			"

								This is a game that I really want to like. I love sailing ships, I love naval combat. And this game is maybe 75% of the way there.But here's the thing. There's literally no explanation of any mechanics in the game. I mean not a single one, there's no help page. No tooltips. No explanation of what things on the Worlds Worst UI do. No explanation about settings and things you can toggle on your ship. If you want to find any of this out, you have to go dig around the game forums, and read explanations of things that are out of date or don't help at all.The players in game don't really answer questions either. I've seen several lost new players asking questions, and being ignored by the veterans in the chat channels. The playerbase obviously isn't putting any effort into helping the new people get a grip on a complex game.The progression is absolutely glacial. I've played for 8 hours now, and haven't even gotten halfway through the first captain level. Even the gameplay gets glacial, once your ship takes enough damage and your crew takes enough casualties (about 5 maybe, it's insane) everything takes longer to do. Guns reload so slow you could watch a youtube video in between shots. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of slower-paced games, and wouldn't like to see this game turn arcadey. But as it stands, the pacing is just painful.When it's on, it's on. It's great sailing into battle, broadsiding other ships. Until everything slows down. It looks like there's a lot of fun metagame in the faction conflict, but you're gonna spend ages grinding before you get out of your baby ship.Wait until the developers get a clue before buying this. As it stands it's maybe worth $20, not the asking price.			"

								You've seen the trailers, right?Few games really live up to its trailers and all its marketing nowadays. This one surpasses it. The realism is there, to a much higher degree than any even remotely similar game I have ever seen. You have your physics, the sea and the wind and the structure of your ship, to take into account in every move you make. You have your graphics, as beautiful as you could wish. And the immersion is there - every battle you fight counts, for good or for bad.The ships range from the smallest cutters and schooners to the heavy first rate ships-of-the-line, and the variety in gameplay is enormous as you raise in the ranks. Furtheremore, the game offers other aspects of the naval Caribbean life than combat between nations - trading, crafting, plundering and politics.This game already has ten times more to offer than the average AAA game, and so far the game has been growing furiously in both size and quality, from the match-based combat game it once was, during the Sea Trails, to the masterpiece it already is, despite a few bugs and a very rudimentary GUI. And this despite its still being considered an alpha version. It offers no tutorial as such, but instead it gives you a cutter to do with as you please, and which you can replace for free once you manage to sink it or blow it up. In my personal opinion, this is the best tutorial you could wish for.And lastly, I know the price is by some people considered rather high for an early-access game, but I assure you: if you would be willing to buy any of those AAA games for 150% of this price, then you should not doubt going for this one too. And contrary to so many of those games, there has been no talk about any DLCs, suscription fees or any other of that crap yet. And that detail alone is very encouraging.See you on the high seas, captain.			"

								This game has been out for over a year now, and I'm sad to say very little actuall game changing content has been released in that period of time, simplest way is to review this is to run through a pro's and con's section:Pro's:-Fantastic simulation ov naval combat.-Nice graphics.Con's:-Empty open world which takes AGES to travel across with nothing to do.-Repetitive boring grinding leveling which is slow.-Very few online players.-Crappy UI which has not been improved in over a year.Basically, this is a great naval simulator no doubt. But it takes WAYY to long to get new ships and levels, and is extremely boring when sailing around the open world, it could easily take 2 hours to travel across the map and there will literally be nothing to do other than sailing. Also the amount of time this game requires to get anything decent or to do anything decent is ridiculos. This game has a similar commitment requirement to a full time job, and the worst part of it is playing this game most of the time feels like a damn job... The dev's fail to understand this game first and foremost MUST BE A GAME that is fun..TLDR; Final rating is 4/10. "

Early Access Review
								I regret having to write a review on an early access game but each patch to the game by the developers have taken it further from it's original purpose which is a ""ship vs ship"" game set in the Napoleonic wars era of tall ships.  The ""action"" in the title Naval ""Action"" is nothing but a lie.  As each patch gets progressively worse, the server populations have plummeted.   The developers have spent too much time trying to create a faulty open world with great but rare  instanced combat.   If you are entertained by hours of sailing for the purposes of  trading or crafting  with very little other player interaction, this may be the game for you.   There is standing joke among Naval Action players that Naval Action is the game you play while you play other games or watch Youtube videos.  At the present time I would not recommend investing time into the game.  I feel that I am seeing a game under development on the edge of failing and I predict that it will be nothing but a memory in less than six months.			"

								I like 18th and 19th century naval warfare. Where I am coming from (?), I have had a presence on Empire TW Naval and Napoleon TW naval. I have also done the alpha of Naval Action. I am very happy with everything I have seen so far (well maybe open world was a little too real, for a while in alpha). I, without reservation, recommend this game. (I don't get a cut...I wish).  These girls and boys from Kiev have made a magnificent game and are very responsive to player input.  May they not rest on their laurels... Hail this game. See you on the seas. "

								After around twenty hours of in-game time with Naval Action in it's current state (Alpha 9.94), I can recommend this title without a doubt. Some strong features about this game are as follows;Pros:- Beautifully designed world.- Accurate, detailed ships.- Excellent graphics and visuals.- Realistic combat and movement speeds (Whilst in battles).- Friendly and helpful community.- Alot of satisfactory for purchasing a ship after grinding.Furthermore, such as every game, there are downfalls and cons, however, I can definitely say that Naval Action is limited in it's cons. Some of those are as follows;Cons:- A large grind for ships and such (This was not an issue for me, however, some may stray away due to the large amount of grinding necessary)- Excellent starter cutter to start things off (Free repair kits, Unlimited durability, etc.)- A basic, modern-esque user interface.- A somewhat lack of variety of ships.Thus, I would give Naval Action the rating of 8.5/10, Recommending it for anyone who is willing to spend their time on learning the ropes of this fancy game. Please keep in mind that this game is in Early Access, and this game will NOT be perfect, there WILL be bugs, there WILL be issues, and if you're not willing to sacrifice those issues for playing an Early Access game, then you'll need to wait to purchase /any/ Early Access game -- Remember to read the fine text before purchasing!Cheers!

Early Access Review
								This game is still in early development as of 1/19/2016. I've played this game before it was on Steam, for many hundreds of hours. The game itself, is an open world game based in the Gulf of Mexico/Bahama's. East coast of America, Mexico, all the islands of the bahama's, and Jamaica, and East coast of South America. Travel:The travel in this game does take awhile. It's a HUGE map, however you don't NEED to travel great distances if you don't want too either. Immersion and Combat: The immersion in this game is very real, and realistic. Distance of the shot, the size of the cannon, the thickness and even type of wood the opponents ship is, the angle your ball hits, the velocity, all of this takes into account whether your ball penetrates, and even how it interacts INSIDE the opponents ship. That's right, a cannon ball can continue to bounce around a few times inside the ship, or blast out the opposite end. Waves and wind will affect your shot quite considerably in smaller vessels, and if you're fighting in a storm, your ship will bob left, right, up and down affecting your shot as well. Your cannon can only aim up, down, left and right to only a certain degree. You can board and capture enemy vessels, sink them, break them down for component parts to make your own ship, or sell captured ships. Port Battles: Port Battles is also a thing, attacking enemy ports or defending your own, complete with defensive towers and the works. If the attacker is the victor, they take permenant control of that port, or at least until you capture it back. Your Choice: How you play is entirely up to you, and what you do. You also do not have to ""grind through the tiers"". Small, medium, and large ships have vastly different play styles, and skills required to excel at them. If you find the the lower rate small ships suits your playstyle more, you can stay in them, and ignore the Man O Wars, and higher rate ships, and your fun will not be diminished at all. -----------The video's for this game do it justice, and are not ""enhanced"" in anyway. You truly can, even from day 1 get into quite frightening battles, or you can go into the less populated area's, and be somewhat safe from attack. If fighting isn't your thing, you can craft or trade as well. Finding a good market, and trade route can be extremely lucrative, and becoming a well known crafter can also be extremely lucrative as well, capable of making high end modules, or even first rate Man o Wars. ----------If you love open world games, love the time era this game is set in, and are genuinly interested in old ship combat, or simply trying to find a new game that that's both immersive, fun, and something you can easily play with friends. This is definetly a game worth getting.			"

								Game had potential and never went anywhere is the basic jist. Map has 330 ports yet only averages 600 players, thus less than 1.5 people per port in a map that spans from Charleston NC to Southern America. The devs refused to address the pirate problem or that it takes hours to get into a pvp engagment that may never materialize. The icing on the cake though is that they announce this summer sale without telling their loyal customer base who paid $50 for the game. Did they provide any redeemable ships or mods to the existing playerbase for paying full price, providing all the great content and feedback, NO.This game doesn't reward the loyalty of it's current players and now it's discounting the price to new players. The question  you have to ask yourself is: ?  Given what you know now, do you trust the devs to finish the game? To correct pirate mechanics? To provide meaningful end-game content? To address the abyssmal 1.5 players per port?The answer is in their roadmap.We plan to open up the ""pacific"". *FacePalm*			"

GREAT resource for newbies!)Cons:-Early Access: still a work-in-progress-Limited gameplay depth: combat is supreme, and crafting/trading is still not fully fleshed out-Limited RPG depth: not much in the way of character creation, customization, roleplaying, etc.Final Evaluation:If you love the Age of Sail, then you should manifest your inner Jack Aubrey and try this game.I understand that the $40 price point may be too much for some to gamble on an Early Access title, so if that describes you, at least put it on your Wishlist and keep an eye on it. The devs have shown themselves thus far to be reliable in meeting their stated goals, as well as responsive to player feedback. Odds are good that the game will only improve as time goes on.			"

								Naval Action is the best you're going to get if you're going for a historic naval game.Many people complain about the grind that is Naval Action, but this is for the best, It's a simulator and sailing will take long, battles will take long, because that's just the way it was back then.This game does not take the casual approach many game developers take these days, It's not made for you just to shoot some ships and quit after a week. Sailing around the caribbean is not danger free, you will get attacked if you do not pay attention, and you will lose your ship. Other way around, you can take ships.(On the other side of the grind, If you own a decent ship, getting money is as easy as taking candy from a baby.)Many people complain about the developers because they don't ""listen"" to the community, this might be true on some occasions, but to say they don't listen is complete b*llsh*t. Just take a quick look on the game-labs forums, everything the developers do is based on player opinions, they players even vote for which ship gets added to the game next.This game is everything the 18th century caribbean had to offer, beauty, danger and hours of sailing. If you are looking for a historic naval game that's not a casual, easy peasy point and click shooter, Naval Action is for you.			"

								Not ready for prime time yet and probably never will be.Beautiful combat mechanics don't mean a thing when boarding combat is a *really* stupid card game and the UI in major sections of the game is unfinished and the fugliest in any game ever. Economy is so broken, players won't accept money when selling stuff - you can only trade not buy because money is worthless. Crafting is a joke and everyone has a fleet of 1st rates. Hardcore players yell at each other for breaking the game (driving players away) by too aggressively attacking foreign nations. (An MMO should never break simply from  attacking enemies). Sailing speed between ports is too slow and the map too big. Boredom yawns and anger mixed with occasional pvp. No avatar. No walking around ports. Anything you do in port is done on a spreadsheet (funny how you don't see those screenshots on the store page!!) And there isn't much to do in port at all.Basically the devs are clueless and impotent. They have created a game that is unfishished and designed to break. Servers (all two of them) are empty. Players gather at a pvp-meeting place and waste hours chatting waiting for someone to show up.  If you remember how badly the devs at Pirates of the Burning Sea broke the best game ever made, well, this game has equally clueless devs or worse. Servers go down daily for 1-2 hours and port battles are not scheduled at convenient times. Updates frequently make the game worse, not better. I would check back in a year, but don't expect much. Amazing potential that will never be realized. Do not waste your money, even on sale. Even if you are hardcore for sailing MMOs. Oh wait, this game never goes on sale - even with empty servers - that's how clueless the devs are!If you enjoy mindless hours driving a boat and playing it like Euro Truck Simulator with a chat window, this game might be for you.

								This game is barely alpha. It's a bad knockoff of Pirates of the Burning Sea.The interface is barley above a DOS level program and lacks even rudimentary functions to get you started. Combat is an exercise in frustration as NPC's are lethal while you can barely hit the broad side of a barn.Can this game be more enjoyable? Certainly, but not without a ridiculously steep learning curve that discourages anyone but a masochist from playing it. All it is, is a wooden ship combat simulator, and not a very good one at that. I accept that its in alpha test and it just embryonic right now, but there's no excuse for basic gameplay functions to be absent, like a working map function or a proper ship description. I am constantly told by the rather limited population that I will learn in time.Sorry, but if a game is not enjoyable from the get-go, it smacks of a failed attempt at cloning a far better version of another  put out years ago for the sake of capturing dollars. Lack of a finished game is one thing along with bugs, but an unenjoyable alpha is hot mess. I will continue to test the game and explore its limited gameplay value and change this review if the game changes as time goes by, but for now, avoid dropping retail money on a barely finished product. I'm sure I'm going to be roundly lambasted for this by the 50 or so people playing it.. so be it.UPDATE : Ok, I've now invested more hours in the game and I'm to at able least kill things and keep from getting killed all the time. That's something.But bottom line, the game is little more than a combat simulator, having no strategic or true MMO flavor to it-- its just mindless killing or getting killed and scraping up enough materials to build your fleet. Hardly worth the time you have to invest in it , to get good. A fresh interface instead of something out of the DOS era, and some true tools for players to interact and customize themselves would help enormously. Also a decent starting tutorial game which provides some immersion is needed before I could recommend this game to others for forty bucks.			"

								Its a mature and modern Sid Miers Pirates minus the dance + EVE online aspects of free roam, community and economy. In a crude mode:Expect combat to be similar to Sid Mier's ( a whole lot more reallistic and detailed)Chat system to be like EVE onlineFree roam to be like Sid'sEconomy to be a mix between player driven and npc controlledWould not dance for items 9/10			"

								This game, while currently in a early stage of it's developement, has a lot to offer. It has a mostly fleshed out combat system, a HUGE open world, and lots of things to do. However the UI is very alpha and not user friendly, it doesn't have much direction, is not very supportive of single players, its not very well optomized, and it has its fair share of bugs. But i think that it has great potential and is a solid Alpha game.			"

								What can you say, this game is awesome.Why?It has nice graphics, very big open world with instanced battles that can be very huge. You can upgrade your ships, buy different cannons etc, and if you want, you can craft your own ship and sail with it across caribbean. Playerbase is good, I havent seen any bad players in the chat. AND ITS ONLY 1GB in size. Literally I was thinking wtf, if this has huge open world why is this only 1GB...Price is high but sure worth every penny.			"

								i cant recommend this game at all .. the dev team ON THIS TITLE  dont follow the players wishes or recommendations the Ship warfare is unbalanced and the harbour ports are a 1 screen Bad Old Norton system experience ... there is no Avatar in it and you cant be captain either .. so you have a boat Huraaay on that .. IF and i SAY IF this game should be any good in the near Future they would need to add contents to the game as they have in Man O´War or Blackwake or Tempest or Sea and dogs .. or RISEN A store line and some LORE god dammit  .. the game is a dead Fish in a pawn as it is now ..

								Edit after some time: this is the first MMORPG ive put this many hours into in years and years. Truly something different.On the fence about getting this one seeing the high number of hours for many of the positive reviews. Took the plunge knowing I had 2 hours to decide before refund became unavailable. Glad I did. For the moment its like the old Pirates combined with World of Warships. Battles are just great, the detail level is a big step up from WOW, the battles are long and tense and swing back and forth as you land shots in the damaged areas and start to cause leaks below the waterline. UI - placeholder, does the jobTutorial - non existant but plenty around in the community, and honestly its not that hard. WSAD to control your ship, your cannons shoot where the mouse aims give or take, you have to wait for the moments when you have a good line due to waves not being in the way. Community helpful so far in PvE serverGrind - yes and no. Yes you have to fight a lot of fights to level up, XP rewards are proportional to the damage you do, and you need lots of slow earned XP - so you would be right in thinking that sounds like grind. Thing is that the battles are so good that I really don't get a sense of grind - this isnt right click on enemy, watch large hit point pool go down, use abilities etc etc, the battles are far better and give me a sense of both pleasure and achievement when I win through against the odds - more like Dark Souls, really skill based.So I really like this. Its absolutely an alpha in early access with a long long way to go to be polished, but you play it to do the ship combat and that is simply the best I've seen. Really interested to see just how good this can get, its clear that it has taken big steps in the direction of being one of the great ship games, comparisons to EVE online frequent and deserved, and could easily go all the way.Certainly worth the price of admission if you liked Pirates! or similar and want something with a really detailed damage engine, and excellent core game mechanics.

								Right then, first of all I just want to say something about the negative comments: Alot of the bad review seem to be from people who know nothing about the game nor seem interested to learn, I.E saying there is 0 guides.. Try checking the game forum (And now it is on steam people are creating guides for quicker access). Waiting times to login. well yea thats going to happen as the game just hit early access via steam.. And that all too important message of It is Early Access!Right then, I was lucky enough to be apart of the early stages of pre alpha testing 2 years ago, the advancement that has been made in that time has just been great, the damage model is fantastic and altho basic to most people the graphics are beautiful. Back when we first got to play on the open world, ports had barely any textures, islands were blurred but it still looks great (A semi comparison would be like legacy rust to current rust.)There is so much more in the pipeline for this game and the devs have been fantastic. They listen and communicate with the tester and player base (Just go to the actual forums) This is a more hardcore realism age of sail game rather than an arcade style boat shooter.The learning curve can be quite steep for some but stick at it and there is the help chanel in chat for newbies to go nuts in.Once you experience a propper fleet battle with teamwork, the sounds n the imagary is just fantastic. You will love this game. If your not that into ships or the timeline then I doubt this game will be for you. It's nice to play a game where the devs put their love into it. 10/10 and still much more to come.			"

								I absolutely do recommend this game. Its a true blue sailing game that put its big boy pants on and actually made something that rides the balance between simulation and genuinely fun. The game itself is only partially fleshed out, and for whats there its already really awesome. The game has spent the past number of months in a closed alpha and the devs do seem to really care abou their game. The game is not your ""Assassin's Creed"" style of naval combat. Its a bit more slow paced and 'realistic' to a degree. The game promises to be something really great, with a player based economy and polical system that has a very pleasant Eve Online flavor to it. The foundations of the open world are already in place with trading, raiding, and basic missions from the Admiralty in place. Each faction (The Royal Navy, The Spanish, The Dutch, The US, Sweden god help you if you go Sweden, Pirates, and Denmark) has its own semi historic territorial holdings in the Caribbean and so far the focus of the game is to expand your faction's port holdings. The Devs promise chunky updates once a month from here on out and there will apparently be no more wipes. I'm hopeful for this game.			"

								I really wouldnt listin to the negitive reviews of people whom have 30 hours or less into the game. people spouting off how bad the game is yet have 0.1 hours played. dont listin to them at all.The game is relaxing at sea. if you enjoy the sound of the ocean, the booms of cannons anda good paced game. this is it for you.You have PVP and PVE servers. you have a mini map. most of how you travel is by figuring out in real time where to go, and getting lost can be done with much ease.Pros would includeShip Vs Ship BattlesPort conqest ( you can take over some other nations port)Ship boarding, (you can board another ship and take it as you're own)Trading (not very fast paced but great if you want to earn some extra money)Ship crafting (yea, you can build ships here and sell them off)Graphics, (very nice graphics in the ships, the sea and the world)i miss the pig cloud thoughDamage control. (You can disable a ships rudder, rip his sails down. or shoot the maste off to disable his speed)ConsGetting lost (its easy to get lost if you dont know what you are doing. never go afk in open world sailing.)Losing you're ship (this is a pro and con here) If you lose a life on you're ship to zero, you lose the ship altogather, at the same time so does you're enemy)long traveling between distances.(Hey its a massive map, dont think something fun will come quick and easy kids, go play call of duty)All in all i say its a very fun and addicting game. i would kinda say it woul dbe like taking a crap in a handicapped bathroom. you have you're space, and have the little handle bars for power squatinThis game would be best most enjoyed if you like 2 of 3 things. Do you like ships old or new?Do you enjoy the ocean and sailing around?Do you love intense battles with bots or players? "

The battles are fantastic fun and highly involving, trying to press your rudder key through the keyboard to get that extra bit of starboard on the buccaneer who is ripping your deck to shreds. Early access, remember guys, this hasnt been fully fleshed out yet, but the trading, battles and sense of satisfaction when you manage to bavigate from port to port without getting lost is great.

								EARLY ACCESS  ( things will change )...at this moment in time...Basically you sail around the Caribbean fighting, trading, crafting, in packs or solo for your chosen nationCombatWhen you attack someone in the open world you are drawn into an 'instance' pretty much like Elite Dangerous.There are a few Rules of engagement that are constantly being adjusted to try to help the lesser combatants so not much point commenting on those here as they're likely to change from one week to the next.Exeptional combat model that has only got better with time from the devs' and input from the community.Easy to get into if you are able to tie your own shoe laces but also complex enough to take time to master.Beautiful models sounds and sea textures.The combat model is pretty much the only thing that is near 100% finished and unlikely to change much and it shows, when comparing it to the rest of the 'game'...  it's simply stunning and even more so when you start to appreciate the subtleties.9/10   TradingTrading all revolves around resources and materials for building ships.To be honest it's very, very simple but it's still being fleshed out.I would like to see a massive economy driven trading system not just about materials for ships, but based around real items that were traded in the set time period.2/10Crafting Very strange crafting model that is very dull and a little RNG I'm not even sure it should be in at all but as with most things this will change and hopefully improve vastly.1/10Naval Action has the potential to be an absolutely stunning title that gives you a hint of what it was like to be in combat at sea in the set time period. I do recommend the game but... only to those people that are intelligent enough to understand it's not a casual game and requires considerable time investment all in a half finished title. It's probably why the price is hefty in an effort to weed out the less passionate gamers given everyone has an input in the developement.FootnotePlayer numbers peak after major updates and fall before them as they wait for content injection or character wipes, it's not uncommon and can happen from time to time...currently we are waiting for an update which is why the numbers are dropping. The experienced players aren't playing, not much point if you've played/tested everything so far and it will get wiped next week so don't take much notice of reviewers claiming the end of the world and the game is dying it's just the usual ebb and flow of early accessI shall return to this review in the future...

								It breaks my heart to write this review of this game as it has such great potential and is a beautiful game however resent things have come to light which is troubling for both those who play the game and its future. This is an email showing the disregard towards the people and why it shall fail in the long viewGame Labs <info@game-labs.net>11:24 PM (20 hours ago)to me HelloCaptain pickle have created multiple posts that required moderator review and did not move discussions forward or did not contribute to feedback. We have unfortunately no time to review posts like that as we have to work on the patch. Creating so many empty fake posts is considered spam and is against the rules of the forum.Thus we suspended your posting rights as a result. The interesting thing is that you made it on the day your premod was supposed to be removed. Solution. Remove your posts you sent for approval.This shows the level of compaction the developers have towards the community that are trying to help there game thrive and yet even to a simple request to interfere with the unjust ruling of THERE official forum which has slowly been made into the seed of the mixed reviews and will ultimately destroy this game as many other online games and even including Grand Theft Auto V which may be where this games fate lies.I have posted the whole event within the discussions under Injustice parts 1 and 2 so all may see the arrogance of the developers and there way of justice however a day into its release it was deleted so I shall continue looking for a location of which it can be put so it may be seen. So if you are looking to buy this game your taking a risk as the dev’s prefer to put things in the game that are senseless and game breaking and don’t even bother going to the forum if you want to try and make it better they will crush you like an insect with restrictions from hell, they might as well make the game for free if this is how they want to run it since most go that way anyways.

								This is not a game, it is a naval simulator, do not expect to succeed or to have a fun time. The game sets you up for failure in the true 1800's naval warfare fashion. Do not expect your Cid Meier Pirates experience, the game play is so slow you will not realize your mistake until it is too late to return it. The simulator is so accurate it does not allow for enjoyable gameplay. After sailing across the map for hours constantly checking your co-ordinance with the map, there is no ""You are here"" mark, you might find an enemy that is of lessor strength then you. Upon activating an instance with that ship of lessor strength, for a ship of equal value I never encountered and ships of a higher value destroy you out right, the ship immediately begins to flee. The pursuit will take up to a hour and half and usually ends with you either facing into the wind unable to pursue or a larger ship entering the battle and destroying you. The canon reload time is extremely fast for naval standards or remarkably slow when compared to the pace of other games. Battles are long and usually end in failure, ideal for those of us who don't rely on success to release dopamine. Who wants to succeed to have a good time when it is far more realistic to fail. The in port actions are not explained within the game and reading through the tutorials I have learned that there is an optimum way of doing things, no competitive tactics or free choice involved. If you want to do things your way you will waste time and lose harder. Overall, as a simulator this product is amazing! Remarkably true to life, it offers all the frustration of life on board ship at the turn of the 19th century. Be prepared to spend hours sailing and still more chasing after your opponents for little reward, a tiny amount of experience and to end your days haul up on a lee shore. After all, the mariners of the past spent their entire lives chasing after fortunes that were just over the next horizon. We can't all be Admiral Nelson and this game certainly drives that point home.			"

								Probably one the of the best game... totally ruined by a terrible, starting, error.This is not a game (and sort of game) that could be ""ported"" on multyplayer: it's a real sim, real sims doesn't work as MMO!Every couple (and less) of years, a company come with a great idea and funds, trying to milk the alredy filled market of MMO with a Sim game...Never saw ANY of these working!There are so many problems building an MMO true Sim game that many are quiet obvious: sim game are difficult to learn and master and... sim game needs a command to accelerate time, and this is not possible playing an MMO game... sim game needs a lot of effort on system design and AI design, and this is incompatible with MMO.And today? This game would have worked PERFECTLY as a standalone singleplayer game and, instead, you have a game that WORKS like a singleplayer game and TRY to attract MMO players.Results? Already two years of work and frankly... we see an ALPHA stage? Maybe a little more?So, you appreciate a lot of things, but, at the end, this game as MMO is simply boring and very, very slow!It's also too simple!I only wait to see this finally being released as an, improved, single player game, but don't waste your time and money if you want to play an MMO.

								I bought that game because i watched a few videos on youtube about it. The fights with frigates are great. There is just one problem with it: You don't get any. Playerbase dropped down to not acceptable levels. But its not about the game itself, no, it's about developers that don't have any clue to develop an MMO. With one patch they deleted the timers to join into a running fight, with the next patch they put it back in but much longer. So what the hell are they doing!? With right now implemented timers for OW-Battles you will always end up in a gank, because you need to go to enemy capital to even see enemy players! So if you are in the lucky position to engage into a fight, more and more enemy players join in, till you need to run or die. Thats fun... no, not really.Save your money, don't buy EA and keep away from Gamelabs.			"

								This game has a lot of promise, if you like sailing ships then this might be the game for you, however this is early access, there is quite a few problems and bugs as you should expect from an early access game.However, the devs do try their best to help. Eg, I got stuck because the game spawned me in shallow water, within 10 mins of me posting on the forums, a dev had responded and sorted the problem for me.Pros:-Good Graphics and sounds-Realistic ship/combat mechanics-Nearly everything in game can be crafted-Runs pretty well on low end computers-Alot of different ships, from small cutters up to 1st Rates ship of the lines-Different ways to play. PvP, PvE, trading or crafting.-Great dev support.Cons:-Can take hours to get somewhere-Alot of grinding to get the better ships-Gankers (when I first started I kept getting attacked by someone in a vastly superior ship, had to quit and go with a more      powerful nation)-No ingame tutorialCommunity (from British point of view)-Big clans control nearly everything, they tend to give ports to allies without informing the lower players who use those ports. I understand we needed to give our allies the ports, but there is no way ingame to notify the players who use that port unless you log in everyday.-Players control too much, For example, USA is getting owned atm by the pirates (who for some reason are classed as a nation) and Sweden nearly got wiped out by the french and danes.-Most player will try to come to your defense if you're attacked (if you're close enough)-Teamwork is needed to surviveIf you want a game where you can just jump on for an hour or so and shoot people with massive warships, this is not the game for you, it will take days to get to the bigger ships.If you want a game where you have to work hard, be part of a large community, help defend your nation against all her enemies, then this might be the game for you.8/10			"

Early Access Review
								Amazing game, large PvP battles are epic!! Countries fight for domination, captains for fame - it is simply just THE game. EDIT: You begin the game with as a low rank captain with a low amount of crew in a ship called ""Cutter"", which is a 12 gun ship (40 crew). When I started playing, it was a looooong way to the top rank, grinding alot of XP towards getting more crew and thereby a larger ship. Max crew under ones command is 1050, which is needed to fully crew the largest ships in the game. The 1st rate battles are EPIC but already as a captain with 200 crew, you will be able to sail frigate class ships with 40 guns, like the famous Suprise. The 200 crew rank is a milestone as a player in this game, because it really kicks off here! This is where you have to learn to manually control sails and PvP will be much more fun. 5 guys in frigates can do some serious damage and take out the largest ship if done right.Its possible to craft your own ships, but this takes some time. When you buy the game and create an avatar, you are given ""labor hours"" (LH) - 42 LH pr. real time hour. These hours can be used to craft materials and in the end combine these and craft a ship. To create materials, resources are ofcourse needed. Ress are produced and consumed in all ports around the map, which means you must sail in trader ships and buy where its cheap(being produced) and earn money by selling in ports that consume a certain resource, if you are meaning to earn cashe - ofcourse pirates or enemies of ones nation are lurking on the seas, around the cays and isles - so dont sail with high value without an escort. Many players like myself are hunting for lone traders, this may take hours but the loot can be worth it. The game is really exciting that way. In this game, you are an asset to your nation, every gun is needed in the large coordination of fleets and clans within a nation. Every nation has been on the verge of destruction, which require all hands on deck and collaboration!- Part of the community is really toxic, put these guys in the ignore list ASAP. - Often its hard for new players to survive - find a good clan in your nation, but be careful. Toxic players tend to team up as well, be sure to join the good guys ^^ - It takes time to master a ship in battle, gaining the wind, keeping the upper hand and wrecking your opponent. All ships have different stats, speed, turning, speed compared to degrees in the wind etc etc. Thats why it can take some time to learn the small things but the depth is also amazing. The game is still under development and within the next few days a new patch will be implemented. This will reset the map and RoE will be changed completely - I look forward to this.o7			"

								The best Naval Simulator out there. Even though I have over 25 hours in the game I have explored less than 5% of the map and tested only 2 ships yet. You have to come to terms with the fact that this game is a marathon, not a sprint. If you are ok with investing time and effort into learning the machanics of sailing, gunnery, tacking and so on then there is nothing better out there currently. It's a realistic simulation and won't give you things like map markers, you have to navigate with your compass. Killing enemy ships takes a lot of skill and time but once you get good at you get this awesome feeling which only comes from knowing that you worked towards it and not just clicked your mouse at a reticule. You will spend about 20 hours just learning the basics (preferably against the AI) and then buying a real ship which will be your gateway to the caribbean. Don't be intimidated by the learning curve though, there are a lot of helpful videos and many helpful people in-game as well. Even if you want to just relax after a long day at work, you can just hop into your little pile of oakwood, pick a heading and sail the high seas!			"

								This is a little slow paced for most gamers used to instant gratification, but it is well worth it. The ships have been painstakingly recreated and are visually stunning. The combat system takes practice to master, both aiming and sailing, but  with a little practice and patience anyone can.  The trading system still need a few treaks, but all in all this game is awesome and has the potential to become even greater. If your looking for a game you can go in an buy whatever you need to win right off the bat, this game is not for you. All in all a big thumbs up!			"

However, this game has awesome historical ships such as the HMS Victory and many more hammering it out in 70 player battles which are just incredible, very addictive and fun. If you're looking for a naval battleship game, this is the ticket for you! ProsAwesome graphics Amazing sound of cannons and destruction Open world You get to take out pirates..(win)Devs are constantly doing updatesCons No belly buttons.

								Naval Action is a wonderful combination. I must stress the game is not for everyone as the battles can be long and hard fought, and also the game is not completed. Trade is still in development, but it still offers lots of opportunities(You need to master it first). Naval combat is where this game excells, The beautiful immersion of the sounds and tactics needed to sink or capture enemy ships is amazing. Also the battles are more realistic focusing on the fact it is not easy to sink a ship of the period. The developers are making good progress and are good with keeping to historical details when possible. This game i would recond to people who want a more historical feel than an arcade feel.			"

								Update: All this time later and with the game ready for ""release"" a bunch of ill-conceived and later reverted open world changes it is still hot garbage, all this open world nonsense was a huge waste of time and effort game is basically dead/dying. Scrap all the open world stuff which at the end of the day is jank and tedious, and make this a world of tanks style game with sail which with some tweaking could be really good. Instead actual combat improvements and design which had appeared to be the strong starting base were not devloped in favor of a huge boring tedious and ultimately pointless ""open world"".Short Version: Would of been great if developed as a War Thunder/World of Tanks style lobby match making game. Instead its promising but unpolished ship fighting buried beneath countless hours of extremly rough ""MMO"" systems and griding.It has potential and the ship combat is pretty excellent unfortunatly the MMO mechanics of the game are something awful. By far the fastest and most effecient way to get into larger ships are to run ""missions"" which as of now consist entirely of go to X kill Y. PvP and open lobby style battles are great but bot and mission grinders are already showing up in these with much more capable ships and dominating. The ""Open World"" map is extremely boring there is really not much going on. There is weather but it does not have any impact in the open world map. You basically stare at water for 15min-hours+ depending on how far you need to go aand with no map marker, you cant really even alt-tab. You may see some other faction and attempt to PvP them but the rewards for the missions are usually much higher and involve less risk. The main problem is the by far best way to progress to competitive ships is the dullest part of the game. It involved sailing to a marker on the map which does not have a marker representing you so you have to navigate by feel. Then you fight one of 2/3 npc ships that spawn for that mission type. The AI does not present a real challenge but the battles still take between 10-40 minutes. PvE gameplay is not bad some people like that but it is really unpolished in this game. Grouping with friends significantly hurts progression. The AI is not the worst but not capable of presenting much of a challenge either. Its always the same battle this one ship easily but slowly win type gameplay.IF they are able to change the focus of this sandbox ships game to PvP at least on the PvP server this could be a great game. They need to at least triple the exp gained in PvP small and large battle lobbies. They need to find a way to diversify the ships used beyond free ship/brig-snow/SoL, again by offering increased xp/gold for people not using a free ship.This game does a bunch of things right but then puts the focus and highest rewards on the least polished and most dull part of the game.

Early Access Review
								For us old seadogs like myself EA used to stand for Electronic Arts and their advert that ended with ""It's in the game"". Nowadays EA stands for Early Access but somehow there are those that expect an EA game to be feature complete(!?). For those that have been here since the devs first starting selling access keys and watched it grow from one PvE instance until now with Open World being just so incredibly huge this game has enough to justify the price for those who don't demand a $100mill game for their $40.Upsides;Slower paced game that simulates the forethought which went into sailing and fighting in Age of Sail ship. A much better ""thinking man's shooter"" than others in the store.No crashes (using the x64 build) and only a couple of graphical glitches and minor, non-gameplay breaking bugs.Very good graphics. No, you can't disembark and walk around the port but that is a small nitpick that takes nothing away from the core game.Downsides;A slower game time-scale wise than many will be wanting to put up with - As one commented in chat the other day if you want to sail from one side of the map to the other plan on doing something other while your ship is sailing (studying, websurfing, etc). Not for the ""I want it now, right now"" crowd.Simple UI - This is one point that needs addressing soon. Something a bit more immersive such as the old ""Pirates!"" game would be nice but admittedly we still have many months to go before we can expect something of that scale to be implemented.A slow grind and even slower for those explorer and social gamers types. The first couple of ranks could be made a bit faster to rank up in. Me being an explorer type played 8+ hours yesterday and am still an Ensign. Those that learn how to make the most efficient use of their time will rank up faster tho' don't expect to rank up like you're playing WoW while wearing full heirloom gear.TL;DRA fun relaxing game that doesn't require the best hand-eye coordination but instead relies on speed management and positioning. Crafting and trading is deep and the player base is generally well-mannered and helpful.			"

								Played less than 30 minutes. Learned all I need to do:PROS-Great graphics-Realistic ships (minus the fact that no crew can be seen on deck which looks stupid)-Combat and sailing mechanics are challenging but realistic-Helpful player base, but insanely small (all servers have around 50 per grouping meaning the max player count was around 150, even though it's likely because it's morning, I highly doubt that the playerbase is much larger than that)-Lots of depthCONS-It's not an MMO. It's just a sandbox sailing game. There's no real involvement with building up your ship other than trying to get the next, best ship.-The player base is tiny.-Way too much time investment for little payoff. There are no tutorials, no help files, and the suggestions you get from chat are to watch YouTube videos or the Wiki. -Devs seem to be super shady.All in all, it's not worth 40 bucks. At all. Not for a game that expects you to do all of the work to learn how to play and what to do. There are better games out there with similar themes (Blackwake for example) that are better supported, have more players, and developers that aren't afraid of critiscism.			"

								The current state of this game (as of 28/06/2016 is not palletable for any new players, especially with a hefty price tag of £30 for a supposed ""alpha"" game..although the main redeeming feature that makes this game unique is the combat instances, I feel like there is a lot more to be desired outside of this - the open world map is large and takes time to travel however the rewards for travelling to certain places for trade is not benefitted, or is not sufficient, meaning this game is purely shooting stuff repetitively for many hours.The devs have released a yearly patch document stating what they will do each month, except they just seem to rework some of the combat system and not really add anything, for instance the UI in ports is utter garbage ( a giant blue slab with white text and some varied colour for rarity types on ships ) There is nothing to do ingame other than fight other ships in an extremely limited range of missions (just tiering up how hard they are with the level you pick, and either being single of fleet missions, the difference being fleet missions have more than two ships involved in the instance to face against)If the devs focused on fixing the open world aspect of this game, and rewarding players for playing differently than just shooting stuff for many hours it would be worthwhile, the alternative, capturing ports, it dull and not worth the effort, time and resources either.TLDR: Devs need to get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and fix the OW aspect, they need to add things to the game and stop reworking them whenever somebody cries about something they dont like and get their heads out of their♥♥♥♥♥and pull this game out of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. (The updates they do release are so infrequent i wonder if this is slowly becoming abandonware to be perfectly honest) Such a shame, this unique game had great potential, seems like they took their money and pegged it to me.

								Great Alpha! Best Alpha I have ever played! I have been gaming since the days of Zork and have seen many changes within the industry. I played EvE Online since release and this reminds me of it but much cleaner and more stable. ONE major issue is all the complainin PvE people that play the game. I hope this game remains a PvP focused game with a sandbox mentality. The devs are great at adding, changing and fixing things quickly. We recently had a bad patch that removed all the NPCs but that was fixed next day. Very Impressive! Keep up the good work. You have a solid game in the works just don't let it be PvE focused.Sandbox, PvP.... Love it!			"

								After playing this game for a few weeks, i'd say its a good balance of fighting and crafting if thats what you like. I'd compare it to a sailing version of EvE. The servers are not overcrowded yet, and that naval fighting is well done. you progress through ranks to gain crew strength which is your main limiting factor in upsizing your ships. crafting is involved, although i do not like the limitations of the number of buildings you can build to gather resources, or the limit on sales contracts. but its still an early access. i imagine this will get balanced. i'll give it a solid 4/5.

								Overall great game starting out can be a pain as it is a very tough learning curve and leveling to the next ranks starts out as a bit of a pain but the realism and beauty of the game is just amazing, The conquesting is also as well very fun, they are large scale battles to take other nations ports in the Caribbean you spawn in a battle line and the attacking team must destroy the towers with very large and powerful cannons on them to win and take over the enemy port.

								Really loving this game. The map is HUGE and for those people who are in it for PvP, you won't have a problem finding it. Those players who like PvE more (but enjoy living on the edge in a PvP world) this game is for you too. Me, I mostly play PvE but on a PvP server, it's more active and if I want to find trouble I can. As someone who is part of a clan, but likes to play on their own, you have the ability to build your own ships with no help from anyone else. And I love that about the game, I don't have to be a navy officer or shipbuilder, I can pick and choose how I want to play, when I play. Looking forward to more options they continue to provide and more battles to come!			"

								The game has considerable promise, but has a long way to go towards catering to both PvE and PvP players. Many recent patches, and ones that have been announced as upcoming features, cater solely to the PvP community and two PvP-specific servers (the PvE server seemingly being regarded as an afterthought and footnote). There are no plans on the part of the devs to implement missions beyond a ""go here, shoot this"" mentality. No discussion has taken place, and no announcements have been made, concerning upcoming PvE-specific items. If you are looking for missions and questing, Pirates of the Burning Sea may be more for you.			"

								The game is very beautiful and feels great - HOWEVER - as a new user, I can't recommend this game because there is ZERO documentation, crappy AI and no hints or guidance on how to even play the game, Unless you are an experienced sailor/simmer, you will spend the majority of your time on Google trying to learn how to play. Not only is there no sailing guide, even the missions and activities such as trading are vague. You just go aroung pressing buttons until you figure things out. One week in and I still have no idea how the game should work. I guess Google is the new user guide for video games...			"

								1. Best Age of Sail combat simulation there is. 2. The game is open world and has own server like an MMO where there are hundreds of players. 3. Play as Pirates, USA, Great Britain, French, Spanish etc.4. The map is huge centering around the Gulf of Mexico, Bahamas and the Caribbean Sea and travelling across the map would take hours. Each of the 100+ port is conquerable.5. Graphics are great. Sea and weather looks realistic and ships look detailed and authentic.6. Wind condition plays important part in sailing, so are ship sailing profiles. 7. A large selection of ships, ranging from tiny cutters, to small brigs, to midsize frigates, and to large ships of the line, including the HMS Surprise, HMS Victory, and USS Constitution.8. Trading & ship-crafting is also important in this game. 9. Some ships are only craftable by players, such as the trader ship Indiaman and other high grade ships.10. A large selection of armaments, ranging from tiny 4 pd cannons to 308 pd mortars.11. Combat, albeit slow paced, is very realistic and deliberate, down to the very details of boarding. 12. The game is early access but very playable, though the UI is a bit rough.13. The game community is very helpful and active, and does regular port battles in large 10+ ship fleets. 14. The game is constantly improving and even if a bit expensive is worth the price for something so special.			"

								I truly wanted to love this game. As a huge age of sail fan, I was so hyped when this came out. Unfortunatley the UI is complete rubbish to the point where upgrades and perhaps ships will even be lost because of it. The FPS demand is beyond insane, and to get the graphics as you want in the pictures you will will have to have a super computer. The combat is fun but I feel like there needs to be more to it I.E. seeing sailors on deck, getting to go first person, etc. The map could have been really intresting but instead its all just treeline on land unless you hit a port, which will not look like a city. Finally, due to recent updates I have found it almost impossible to join any missions because of time reasons. The game is grind from the beginning, and overall I do not feel that I spent my 40$ wisley with this one. I hope for improvement in the future, but for now I will not recommend it.			"

								Age of sail MMO/simulator. Combat is a bit more slow than is usual for these games, and requires some forethought when it comes to planning your maneuvres. A large open world with many ports to explore, and many different activities to pursue. It is still in early access, and as such a little rough around the edges. No tutorial means that at first the game is a bit confusing, but Reddit and the in-game chat are a big help. This game has great potential, but is already playable and enjoyable. Ships range from small sloops to massive ships of the line, and the combat is solid and satisfying.Would recommend, and anticipate it to become even better than it already is.			"

								There is no manual or training missions. You will start in a ""capital"" port with the opposite side sitting out side waiting to pick you off. Game has some serious bugs, such as... windows that popup in the middle of combat, blocking you from doing anything, get into combat doing 20 knots but start the battle at 0knots against the wind, get jumped in a storm with 0 visibility, ships that scrawl in land... etc. You basically start helpless and stay that way... yet you pay for this game. This game is not worth a penny. 40hrs and I delete the game.			"

								I was apprehensive about buying this game in early access because I've been burned by EA games before. But I'm glad I finally bought it. -The combat in this game is solid naval combat. Except for the poor looking boarding menus. Boarding works but it isn't fun and they'll have to change it for it to be fun.  -It is open world and kind of reminds me of POTBS MMO if any of you played that.  There is a map but it doesn't ping your location so you have to rely on terrain and your compass right now. Also the missions are indicated by crossed white swords which can be hard to see during the day ( I suggested they change the color of those).-The port screen is ugly but fully functional. It does have a little messege saying Test UI please ignore so it will change. Making it pretty is something probably low on their priority list and that is ok.-The ships are beautiful but I'd like to see more customization of colors on the wood/designs, possibly sail color (but not a big deal), and a maybe a custom captain avatar sailing the ship. Right now every ship is the same color in its class, the deck's cannons do change style depending on what you have equipped,  and there is a very generic crew representation (which is ok enough for me, but some might want more here).-Sound effects and smoking cannons are great but the game doesn't have a music track yet, so I use my own in the background.-there is crafting, trading, and gathering resources to build ship which is nice. There is even a chance at making better ships such as exceptional.-there is clans, PvP, PvE, and co-op play so it has it all there. Not only can you craft, sell/buy ships, but you can also capture them in combat which is always nice(again boarding isn't fun right now though).     Overall I enjoy  the game because I like naval combat and love playing it with friends over voice chat. However I also like customization and role playing which is lacks, but I can see them building on. I can see this game going a long way and recommend in its alpha state if you want a good naval combat game with the understanding the RPG element of it is growing and not complete yet.			"

								To be read with British accent…….Cannons & wooden ships, what could possible go wrong? Down to Davy Jones’ locker you go!Well not most of the time……Based on the age of sail, wait, for those dimwits who can’t understand “age of sail”, that means your boat does not have a motor (NO♥♥♥♥♥♥ it uses the wind for power. Boats at this time were made out of wood, so don’t expect to be driving the Bismarck around the Caribbean. Enough of the intro lets move on shall we?Open World: Real life locations, beautiful sea, pirates, ports where you upgrade your ship or buy a new vessel, create a fleet (if you have the gold and experience), start battles, join your allies’ battle, attack merchant ships for expensive goods (my fav). Choose from a loads of nations: The British Empire (my fav XD), the French Empire (boooooo), the US (“damn colonial rebels” says in British accent), the Spanish Empire (filthy Spanish! I hate them…idk why but I do XD), the pirates (cowards and scum. I always go for theses ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s first). Plus a few more nations that I forget….sorry XD. Naval Combat:Use your brain and you will survive (hopefully). Don’t expect to start off with a first rate ship of the line with 108 guns (most powerful type of ship in the game). You, yes, you young captain you start off with a small 12 gun cutter. Sad and pitiful, you will work you way up to get better and bigger ships. Combat is fun and realistic. Cannons sounds like cannons do. Smoke textures aren’t bad would like to see something of a high resolution. Boats look beautiful. You can fire one cannon at a time or all of them (what we call a broadside). You can destroy the enemy’s sails, kill their crew members, or just batter the ships hull until she sinks (what I do most of the time). And there is also the option to flee……cowards use that tactic often. You’re not one of them are you? If you wanted to……you could always capture the ship! Sinking them is much more fun. OVERALL:It’s a blast. Community isn’t fill with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Listen to pirates of the Caribbean theme with this game….will thank me later. Fought a brig in a cutter, lasted 5 mins 10/10 would get reckt again. Don’t do that plz. The devs still have lots to work on. Game needs better animation, cannons need to recoil, easier way to get to better ships. In the end the question you have to ask yourself is….would you to rule the Caribbean and slaughter the enemies of your empire through naval combat? Yes, Yes you would.If you see me in game say hello and I hope, we conquer the Caribbean together! I always play as the British Empire, just letting all of you know. Good luck young captains! May God go with you. "

								First let me just say the game looks great and has alot of potential. Now having said that at this point it is horrinly frustrating to try to pley as a noob. Biggest complaint is the map. some good info there but the thing you would need the most (show your location) is not there, instead u have to zoom in and try to use co-ordinates to approximate your location, while this is relaistic navigating, it lends little enjoyment to the game when you are new and cant find a damn mission  because not only is the navigating on map horrible, the mission locations are vague so you end up sailing around for literaly hours looking for something. This may be fun to some people but to me its a colossal waste of time and money. Im sure this appeals to some peopel who managed to last past this initial frustrating period, but for me its just lame. Unless they fix this BIG issue  I would definately NOT play this game.			"

One major downside is you will need a really good machine with above average video card to run the game even on low settings.I did not like the fact I could have only character  per sever especially on the pve server, as I wanted to try out different factions.To be fair, this really is an alpha  and things should get better with time. I just think most players should wait till it's father along before plunking down 40 bucks.			"

								This is early release so many of thee things may change. IMO this game is not worth purchasing until its finished as it seems to have lost difinitive direction. Too many easily manipulated player functions which effects everyones gameplay (politics). A skewed and listless economy and crafting system which they cant seem to get a handle on. I've put much time into all of those aspects , and without any positive direction , and almost no communication (or any doccumntation at all ) at this point from the developers I cant honestly recomend this to ""casual"" gamers. If you like grinding for hours , sitting in wait for large battles , or simply enjoy sailing near empty waters ( at this point) for the sake of an age of sail game, than you may enjoy this and feel the money is worth it. If you have but a short time to play (couple hours) you may not. Again , all of this may change as it develops. Time will tell. Its still an alpha and your basically paying to test a game where major functions may change not to your liking. You need to decide if that is worth it to you			"

								The reviews for this game are very strange.  I guess if you like EXTREMELY slow paced games with very little content then you'll love this game.  If you enjoy sailing around for hours on end with nothing much to look at, you'll love this game.  If you enjoy seeing a game that did almost zero research into historicaly based game play, you'll love this game.  So as you can tell I'm not to fond of this.  It does have potential, and yes they say it's in ""Alpha"", but from what I'm reading on the forums they may not be implementing some of the features this game needs to make it actually ""fun"".   Currently it's tedious and the grind is unreal.  Even though during age of sailing they portray in this game had a lot of accurate ways to navigate the seas, this game has ZERO!  Yes, ZERO!  You have a compass that tells you direction.  You have no way to set compass headings from your map, your map has ZERO interraction with your compass.  You can't navigate by using the stars....no really, you can't!   This is a deal breaker for me, just lame.Long story short....avoid this game unless you like to sail around and look at subpar graphics and enjoy a long grinds to get marginal rewards and enjoy a mildly entertaining combat system.

								DO NOT BUY!!! 95% of this game is Sailing in the open ocean for hours at a time, with nothing to do at all. the 5% of actual combat that you do encounter withh either end up in the person running for hours at a time, or being overwhelmed by enemies and dying/losing your ship that takes weeks to make. The only way anyone can actually play this game is if you own 5+ accounts and use alts to do the hours of sailing so you can actually get on and actually get into the combat. there are about 100 players MAX on their main servers. overall about 300-500 people actually play this game. and thats not counting alt accounts. For example, one night our clan decided to take some enemy ports, we saw there were 100 people online, so we asked everyone in teamspeak how many alts they have logged on, it turned out that we made up the entire server population at the time which was about 20 guys logged in our teamspeak, which really put the scope of how many people actually played this game lol, nooneNow for the 5% of the game that is actually decent. The actual combat. Mostly it is people teleporting in and out of different ports all over the map and waiting hours for a ship to eventually show on the horizon, then they will call their friends who have also been teleporting around at different ports for hours to then teleport over to him, and they will 5v1 that poor guy who spent hours sailing somewhere witha  max hold which equals to about 5% of resources for crafting a ship. The combat is extremely slow, generally max speed is about 15 mph in battle. Also the ""Boarding combat"" is a joke its a ""minigame"" of rock paper scissors. There is no first person aspect nor does your ""crew move around the ship"" they just stand there like foosball mannequin's. There is no blood, the damage on ships is purely cosmetic in battle, with the esception of breaking a mast.Overall if you like wasting hours upon hours sailing around with no ""action"" then this is the game for you. If you thought this was an action packed game then you are sadly mistaken.P.S. The devs told most of their playerbase to leave good reviews for this game and the community will be ""rewarded with updates"" now months have past and they never rewarded the community who left good reviews lol. So most of the positive reviews on this game were from devs trying to trick their community so they can increase their sales.			"

								Ok, I will give you a little back ground. I loved POTBS. Thought it was a great game right up till they sold off. I was kind of excited to see this game. A friend was playing it and verry excited about it. I himed and hawed about getting into another navy game. So I decided to take the plunge, and now sorry I did. To be honest I cant say all things are bad. The sea graphics are exelent. The cannon fire and aiming great. The crafting system seams good too, I like the labour hour storage. Now over to the dislikes.1.  I am sure that in the 1700's they where using sextant. So why do I not know where I am in the game. 2. Ship speed, Why am I going so slow in a small boat and turning like a barge. I do understand that a large ship going with the wind and all of it sale can over take a small ship. I do understand tacting the wind in a small boat. But when I get in a battle with a small boat against a big ship, skills in knowing this are of no use when my speed in manurving are nerfed. One like thought out of this they do have the dead spot, They should also have with it the ability to take the other ships wind that is running form you.3. Nice spread sheat for a port. Am I back in dos? I undrstand this is alpha and It will probally change. But with so much detail to the ships and the beautiful ocean., they could have sat down and done something better.4. Attacking ships as a team, I dont understand why I have to go out side the circle to enter the battle that I am trying to join with a team mate. If you are in a group you should be pulled in together.Right now I wouild give this game a 5/10, I will be watching and trying it after patches to look for improvements.  I am not going to recommend at this point just because of the price point.			"

Early Access Review
								I've only had the privilege of playing Naval Action alpha for the month prior to early access but I've found it to be fun and it's got great potential. It's a slower paced game with moments of high drama. Players that enjoy games like Eve online, POTBS or Elite Dangerous would probably enjoy this.Sailing the ships is a joy, the devs have really nailed that part of the game. It does take some practice to get any good at it especially the gunnery and manual sail control. You actually have to aim your shots here, there’s no tab target and use ability type stuff.The graphics are really well done they can be taxing on some systems though and at this point the port UI still is unfinished. The game world is large and as a result getting from A to B takes time. This gives you plenty of opportunity to chat with other players, plan you next crafting project or plot your next attacks. This may annoy players that expect things to be fast paced, others like me really enjoy a relaxing sail from island to island.The game supports both PvE and PvP players with both types of servers available, the difference being you can’t attack other players in the open world on the PvE server.  PvP options include fighting on the open world, arena type battles and port battles for territory control. For the less violent types there is crafting, trade and hunting NPC’s on the open world map. There’s also a rudimentary mission system, currently only simple kill NPC missions but they’re pretty challenging none the less. One thing I must say is the game is very stable I've not had a single crash in 100 hours of play and the only bugs I've reported have been typos in the test. There’s still a lot of ideas and improvements to be added though so the next few months are going to be exciting. "

								A good game that takes a bit of time to master, levelling up the ship tech tree can be a bit of a grind but fleet battles and port wars are good fun. Lots of PVE missions if you dont like pvp but AI quite good so not that much difference.well worth a look IMHO.			"

								If you love Age of Sail, get this game. It is fantastic as it is, even though it is still an alpha and very much in development. Ive played for about 20 hours now, simply doing the AI missions and am still not bored, even though there is currently only one mission type implemented. Ive also done some PvP on the OW map, mostly out of curiosity, but I did have to run on those few occasions, luckily I know the sail profile of my ships pretty good and can usually outrun bigger enemies. Game is great fun.			"

								Grind is very boring seeing you have to do the same missions over and over to level up.If you dont mind the grind the end game ships are very fun to use. Game is very hard to understand when you first start but there are many guides on the internet to help if you are to lazy to figure it out yourself. 6/10 very little amount of younger players due to hard learning curve.

								I was a huge fan of Sid Meier's Pirates! back in the day. More recently I enjoyed the MMO Pirates of the Burning Sea. If you liked both of those games, you'll love this one. It is a bit more technical than PotBS and a lot more than Pirates! but it is easy to get the hang of. The graphics are amazing. One thing you do need to realize though, this game isn't done yet. A lot of the menus look like crap. There are bugs. A lot of stuff is left to be refined. If you can get past that, this game is an amazing sailing game. If you can't get past that, this game has a lot of potential, so follow it.There are NO official tutorials yet. I recommend you read and watch the videos members of the community have created before you start playing or you will be a little lost. There is a thread on the official forums that contains them.

								Naval Action already presents a significant amount of potential.  I immediately sucks you in and forces you to ""learn to sail"" and fight with naval era weapons.  The artwork is beautiful, the gracefuly captured the ships as you would expect them to look and the water is stunning.  Given further development of more ships, crafting, a wider array of missions and a more balanced country system (only allow a certain number of players per country) it will be great.			"

								Fun game with realistic elements of battle. The grind to higher ranks can be a bit absurd though, and it can be a bit boring being stuck with the same vessel for hours on end, because ranks grant availability of new and better ships. Also, if you dont know anyone who owns this game, i really recommend you finding a clan to play with - solo play is out of the question. Overall, its the most realistic naval warfare game, though lacking of things to do besides battles which can get a bit repetetive after a while.			"

								The best naval game i've ever played, it's like sid'meiers pirate, but better which is incredible. Even tho it is still a work in progress this game is worth the money. The battles are fun, the trading is getting really interesting, the world looks beautiful and it is as historically accurate as it can be.Cooperation with other players is recommended, finding a clan or a group of player to help you gain experience and ships is paramount.Ships can be crafted and upgraded and this can really make a difference. No pay to win there, only experience and sharing ressources with your friends.But do know that this game requires time, a mission isn't a 20 minutes thing, you have to sail to the place which can be relatively far and battles are slow (but intense), huge sailing ships were not known for their speed. I personnaly don't like to start the game if i don't have a couple of hours in front of me.So far the developpers have delivered everything i expected and more, i hope it continues.			"

								Sailing, Crafting, Trading, Ship Building, PvP, Single Player missions that you can also invite your group to help you with, PVE, helpful community, large map has to be 200 ports too many to count, and massive ship battles some as large as 40 on 40 all in an Open World... whats not to like. Pay no attention to any of the Neg Reviews, most of those idiots played less than an hour and are too stupid to figure the game out. So they whine bad game, neg review 0.2 hours played lol.... Granted the game is in alpha, there is a lot that still need developing, but the game is fun and very addicting in its current state and really looks to have a great future. Nearly all files are server side so should keep any hackers away, very small download 2gb. No lag, no congestive log in, no bugs so far that I have seen. Set in about the 18th century naval warfare.			"

								FIRST: It's an alpha. Many systems are missing, many are unrefined. It's fun but don't expect a full game yet!This said, as a fan of C.S.Forester novels, I love this game. I have bought it on an impulse after playing Windward just to relax and boy, was it the right decision.Currently what has received major focus is the naval combat (surprise!) - it feels good! While a bit overwhelming at the beginning and the interface not being in any way final, after spending a couple of hours and reading around (no manual, no tutorial yet but plenty of guides on the forum and youtube) I started enjoying myself immensely. I really believe the combat captures the right spirit of the era and to any sailing ship fun this will be a delight. After overcoming the initial part I realised I was craving for even more complex mechanics to tackle (and which are on the way).The open world part certainly still needs work but the beginnings are all there. It is very rough on the edges but with time and feedback it can only improve, especially because the dev team actively listens to the players and tries to fix issues and rework system to make it the most fun possible.So if you like naval combat and are not afraid of PVP (let's be honest, that's where the fun is)  then grab your portion of rum, hoist your sail and sail on towards adventures and glory!

								This game is like if Syd's Pirates were a 2D, topdown view, openworld shooter this game would be a 3D roving 3rd person view, openworld sailing combat simulator. I put in ten hours and it was so fantastic I wanted to say something.The world looks beautiful. The combat is suitibly complex for the goal of being a tall-ship sim. Gunnery is hard and fantasticly seemingly phsics based with every cannon moving somewhat uniquely (truly gorgeous). The damage model seems relatively realistic for a computer game. The community seems very active helpful and enthusiastic at least at this time. It's a pretty cool game imho.  You  have to sail the Carribean looking for booty. It's hard to go wrong with a concept like that for me. This game is seriously relaxing and stable for me. Absolutely no crashes yet.The hydrodynamics are gorgeous. The sea looks it should look and has a realistic day night cycle (not to scale). As sombody that enjoys sailing this game inpressively invokes the experience while complicating gunnery with the constantly changing levels in a storm.			"

								This game is really worth trying if you like this sort of thing. Don't expect to be on for a few minutes, sailing takes time as does combat. Expect to be in a battle for atleast 10minutes 1vs1. Also don't expect GPS, you have to use your brain to figure out where you are on the map. Trading is not too hard but offers no EXP right now. The combat is Solid and fun, it feels right. The sounds of cannon is really nice, especially cannon fired in the distance.Crafting is ok though again, takes time. This is a nice addition as it can help to play the market a bit. Making money on the market requires some luck and some skill.  Looking forward to future update as it can only get better from here.

								Finally Naval Action will hit the EA.To get some Informations for new players I am going to write this review.I've been playing the game since May 2015 (Alpha State).About:Naval Action is a mmo open-world sandbox ship fight game. The ships are from the age of sail. At the moment this review was written there are no other games like this.You play as a captain, sailing a ship along one of several nations including GB, Swedish, US, French, Spain, Danish and even pirates. As a nation you need to stick together, to gain more exp and defeat your ports against the hostile nations.Yea thats right, you need to defend your ports. As the game is pvp based all the ports of a nation can be obtained by hostile nations, what leads to huge port battles that gain you extra exp aswell. The fight-system is instance based. So you sail along the openworld map located in america and join battles with your friends or start a battle against an enemy ship you see on the water. The huge maps and hundreds of ports make it even very interesting for players just wanting to explore everything and look at the beautiful graphics. As you fight enemy ships (PVP or PVE) and do quests you will rise in rank. This allows you to hire more crew members needed to control large ships. The ships itself can be upgraded and sticked with different cannon types, for example short range carronades that give u a lot of damage but won't work if another player just destroyes you from range with his long cannons. This gives the game a nice tactical touch, especially when participating in big PVP battles (like 40 players for example).Features:- Nation based gameplay to garanty PVP (PVE Server is availible aswell if you dont like PVP)- Port battles (obtain the enemy port and use it as your new headquarter!)- Crafting System (for ships, upgrades and cannons. To get the best stuff, you need to craft it)- Trading System (ports produce ressources needed for crafting, but not every port produces the stuff you need)- Open-World - Instance based battles- Boarding-Feature (You can capture enemy ships and its holding)- Different ammunition types for tactical use (demasting, kill crew, destroy ships)- Different Upgrades and Cannontypes (make your ship suit your playstyle!)I totally recommend this game and are looking forward for new players joining our current playerbase. At the end of the alpha testing we are around 500-1000 players already. Please be aware that the game is still in early access. Thats why there is no ""nice"" User-Interface in the ports implemented yet. But the fightsystem and graphics on water are absolutly fantastic.See you on the map, captain!			"

								It´s currently in dev limbo, slow and small updates, not the nicest of Devs but a small and helpfull community. If you are willing to stomach the really steep learning curve, invest some time into this game and are able to make friends and join a gaming group, you´ll have some decent fun in challenging PvP matches. The solo-experience is rather bad, NPC Ship combat ranges from pretty decent to downright abysmal, trading and crafting are basically Travel Simulator and looking at Excel-The Game. The open map... serves its purpose. it´s big, it has a lot of ports, islands and NPCs to make the vast Carribean sea feel somewhat alive but that´s about it. You can fish while you travel, but the fishing is a completely passive process based on RNG. The Combat feel is unparalleled. The ships handle great, it feels very realistic and hitting a full broadside, watching the splinters fly and seeing the enemy sinking is really damn satisfying. So: If you´re coming for the combat: Prepare to stomach a steep learning curve and sometimes tedious NPC fights to be rewarded with splendid looking, well modeled ships and a nice community trhowing PvP events from time to time. If you´re coming for the sailing: It´s only the ""real deal"" in combat, the world map sailing is basic WASD maneauvering. Don´t come for the rest, that´s not really fleshed out (yet)Conclusion: Do not buy this at full price. It´s not worth the money in it´s current state and the propability of reaching such a state is there, but it will take time, likely lots of it. Grab for a Tenner on sale if you are in dire need of age of sail naval battle simulations but that´s about it, after all it´s still alpha/beta/hatever you call the early access state limbo steam does nowadays. Do i recommend it? Yes-no. The battles are fun but incredibly challenging, they can take well over an hour, expecially in smaller vessels with 4-6 guns per side. Large-scale Big-ships-brawling is damn sexy tho, but it takes a harsh grind to get there. 5/10, room for improvements, might be improved in the (near) future.			"

Early Access Review
								I purchased Naval Action via their website just before the Steam Early Access release. In general I have been pleasantly surprised at the current quality of the game. I have logged 30 hours on this and game has never crashed on me or become unplayable. I have experienced the odd bug but the devs seem to work quickly to resolve them. The game itself in its current state has plenty to do. The joy of sailing around an Open World Caribbean is there. You join a nation and are essentially at war with all other nations (attacking your own nation’s ships, unless they are carrying contraband, makes you a pirate for life). So whether it’s hunting down a trade ship or a frigate, there are enemies to fight, both PC and NPC. There are also Port Battles which can decide whether a port will change hands to another nation. These often become big organized PvP affairs.The game was already populated by an active community before it came to Steam. There are active player groups with each nation. The website forum has  many threads on the full range of subjects that a new player will want to know. This is a good thing because the game currently lacks tutorials. Right now there are two sides to the game, combat (sailing around, accomplishing missions or fighting) and crafting/trade. You can craft basic goods and ship upgrades all the way up to crafting ships, which can then be used by you or put on sale in a specific port. You can also buy/sell goods in different ports.Please note that in Naval Action, your XP rank limits how many sailors you can command but there is no limit on the ships you can buy. So you start off at 40 sailors (and a Cutter that needs 40 sailors to man it). Thus, even if you have the gold to buy it, you won't be able to man a frigate that require a crew of 200 or more, let alone a Ship-of-the-Line. An undermanned ship often performs poorly in every way. So resist that “buy” button, even when you have the gold to pick up a big warship. Make sure you can crew it (and outfit it with cannons/carronades, with you must buy separately).The other thing that should be noted is time. It can take a while to sail around in the Open World, especially if the wind is not in your favor. Hitting the seas for a full 30 minutes or an hour is not unheard of if your destination is several ports away. The Open World also has no real navigation tools. From your starting point you really have to look at the map (M), decide on a bearing and sail in the direction you want to go. Once land disappears you don’t know where you are, its pure guesswork and planning. Just sailing off without paying attention to the compass can get you lost. Note that behind the chat window in the upper left hand corner of the screen in Open World Sailing there is another panel that gives you some options, including allowing you to teleport back to the nation’s capital port. For faster play, there are missions that typically allow you to jump into combat fairly quickly, from a load screen for a simple PvP match, or a mission that sends you to a spot in the Open Worlds near your current port to do battle. These two mechanisms are often the best way to grind up gold/XP but are also the most convenient for players with limited gamer time. Expect a slight learning curve because of the lack of tutorials and a sometimes not-so-intuitive UI in a few places. I spent a lot of time combing through the forums on Naval Action’s website for the answers to various questions the first week I started playing. I highly recommend spending a lot of time in the starting Cutter (it's free and replacing it is free) to get acclimated to the game. In general, if you enjoy Age-of-Sail, you'll enjoy this game, even in its current Early Access incarnation. "

								For anyone who's played games like sid meirs pirates or seadogs 2 this is a must have. Currently lacking any on shore content this early stage of the game focuses on the ship to ship combat side of simmilar games and has done it very well. Ship combat is fluid and fast paced whilst maintaining a degree of realism that makes it a joy to play. With promises of a revamped UI (its a shambles at the moment) and on shore system, this game is an excellent one, be it far from finished.			"

								Well implemented early access with enough things to do in game. Runs clean, with the occasional crash obviously.Thing I like about it the most is I feel like I don't have to grind. I can just f**k about and have fun with it.1)Community driven development (that means get on THEIR *not steam* forums and be active)2)Plenty of ships in current state to play around with and build. Also at least a dozen in development3)Mostly helpful community (as the game has scarce documentation unfortunately, tho most of the mechanics have been figured out and there's steam guides...don't forget about the damn steam guides)For those non-recommending reviews having issues with chat bans or with the way the development process is going then get involved and stop being a prick. This isn't EA or Ubisoft...it's a team of 10 people trying to make everybody a decent game. Chat bans are handled by hand not by some keyword system. "

								hmm i will say i recomend this game for those who liked Sid Miers Pirates but always wanted to play it with others.this is very simliar but also very diffrent.here are some pro's and con's i put the cons first as i feel get past this and i think the pros will be worth it.Cons:has no easy way to find out how to do stuff like sail or use manual sails.Has no location on Map thus making it hard for people who dont know how navigate.Takes for ever to get most places (7hrs of game play from the French starting Zone to the NW French lands in US)game is still in production so things like UI are not stellaryou can easly lose all your cargo if you forget to put it into your cargo hold in a port you dont have a outpost.Starting Ship combat is very hard due to waves casueing shots to miss. (gets better in bigger ships)Zerg nations like US/Brits make smaller nations harder to playCan be as adictive as cocain.....Pro's:IS HIGHLY ADICTIVE played 141 hrs in last 2 weeks alone...is not just a Sailing game it is also a factional Strategy game as well with nations declaring war and taking ports from othersthe PVP is both exciting and fun.allows for diffrent styles of play you could be a mercant or you can be a pirate or you can form your own clan into a Notional Navy reserve to protect your nation. you can do crafting of ships to make your money or you can lead your nation in war aganst another.  you can sail around hunting NPC fleets.lots of diffrent ships to choose from that have there own Benfits or defects and allow for a player to find a ship that seeks his style of play better.this game is not completed but it is damm good and playable even now. it can have a hard learning curve but i suggest spending a few hrs looking up Utube vid guides and you will learn all you need to know from this game.for best enjoyment Join a non Zerg nation like the French/Sweeds/Danes/Dutch/Spain somtimes being a underdog just means u got more people you can kill :) "

								Three things that distinguish the game:-It's the best naval combat simulator out there. It beats such giants as Age of Sail, Pirates of the Burning Seas or Sea Dogs. You control every individual gun if you want to, you can control individual masts to turn faster or decide at what angle/distance the guns will converge. Ships react realistically to wind or gunfire damage, they can even be set on fire. This game offers slowpaced but hugely realistic and fun fights where a small cutter can outmaneuvre anyone, a swift frigate is the jack of all trades and a huge, slowturning ship of the line should better stick to a strict line of friends to survive. -It's a true MMO sandbox. The downside: there is no tutorial, you have to rely for forums and youtube for (good) explanations, there is nothing resembling a ""story"" and leveling up takes a lot of time. The upside however: It's an enormous open world where you can sail anywhere and it will take you more than 5 hours to cross from east to west and you will have to use only your compass without relying on an automap. It's a world of thousands of players, if you play on a PvP server you can be part of high politics made by the mighty guilds/fleets, conquer ports for ressources, try to starve your enemy out or make your nation the ultimate underdog, biting the large empire in sensitive spots. While the main part of progression is nearly exclusively combat at the moment (it will change in the future), traders and especially crafters play a huge role in supplying this war effort, where large crafting chains of coordinated players are usually coming together to build huge ships of the line. Important Disclaimer: You can play this game as a casual pretty well, however a game session of 15-20mins will not bring you anywhere since travel times are longs and fights might lasts for some time. However if you can spend an hour a day on this game and are an avid age of sails fan it will not disappoint you. "

								I say recommend, but it comes with some serious caveats. For those of you who love age of sail and have patience, this is a solid game as its stands (although certainly no where near a finished product). PVP is stimulating and with the right groups requires coordination for major campaigns (for example, not strange to see multiple squadrons with some attacking the port and others screening for enemy players in order to keep them from reinforcing). For those with a more tentative interest, whether it be the final vision, a passing historical interest, or desire for a new MMO... I suggest you fully research what you are getting into and perhaps give the game a little more time to mature. The economy, the mission structure, the crafting, diplomacy, etc. are all still heavily in development.			"

								hmm i will say i recomend this game for those who liked Sid Miers Pirates but always wanted to play it with others.this is very simliar but also very diffrent.here are some pro's and con's i put the cons first as i feel get past this and i think the pros will be worth it.Cons:has no easy way to find out how to do stuff like sail or use manual sails.Has no location on Map thus making it hard for people who dont know how navigate.Takes for ever to get most places (7hrs of game play from the French starting Zone to the NW French lands in US)game is still in production so things like UI are not stellaryou can easly lose all your cargo if you forget to put it into your cargo hold in a port you dont have a outpost.Starting Ship combat is very hard due to waves casueing shots to miss. (gets better in bigger ships)Zerg nations like US/Brits make smaller nations harder to playCan be as adictive as cocain.....Pro's:IS HIGHLY ADICTIVE played 141 hrs in last 2 weeks alone...is not just a Sailing game it is also a factional Strategy game as well with nations declaring war and taking ports from othersthe PVP is both exciting and fun.allows for diffrent styles of play you could be a mercant or you can be a pirate or you can form your own clan into a Notional Navy reserve to protect your nation. you can do crafting of ships to make your money or you can lead your nation in war aganst another.  you can sail around hunting NPC fleets.lots of diffrent ships to choose from that have there own Benfits or defects and allow for a player to find a ship that seeks his style of play better.this game is not completed but it is damm good and playable even now. it can have a hard learning curve but i suggest spending a few hrs looking up Utube vid guides and you will learn all you need to know from this game.for best enjoyment Join a non Zerg nation like the French/Sweeds/Danes/Dutch/Spain somtimes being a underdog just means u got more people you can kill :) "

								Vastly underrated game. Tons of fun for anyone with a taste for an age of sail game with great combat mechanics. Still early access, still alot of content to come, but they seem to be churning it out at a reasonable and steady pace. There is a deceptively large amount of stuff to do in the game, I don't even play on the PvP servers myself. you can craft your own ships or craft them to sell, you can build buildings on your outposts now, fish passively as you travel, use the fish for selling or crafting. lots of combat options from the basic missions and smuggler hunting/capturing to massive battles between factions and the Epic Events at high level. Great game to play with friends.			"

I'm no expert reviewer, however with over 450 hours already clocked in before it became EA i can tell you this is a game worth having for those who enjoy Age of Sails warefare and trading and it's even got a decent Crafting mechanic.  This is a Great Simulator with a very large Open World Map (literally will take hours to cross).This is not a game for those who prefer short gameplay sessions or are looking for an arcade style naval shooting game... World of Warships is probably what your looking for then.			"

								Great game so far and one of my favorites in the last years.Contentwise it is rather heavy on the action side right now. It is not a bad thing and the game is very enjoyable, but if you expect a great story or trading simulator will be dissapointed at the current stage. The main part right now are battles, basically standart open world battles against whatever you encounter on your journey and different forms of large PvP battles. While many other features, like trading and crafting, are still in development with only a basic version in the current implemented into the game so far. These will be extendet inn future updates.I am playing this game since the Sea Trials and still really like. This is still just the Early Acces  version and with the development progress of last year in mind I expect this game to turn out very well.There is no in-game introduction yet so search youtube for an intruduction to get the basics. It is not too hard and defenitely worth giving it a try.			"

Early Access Review
								A game really worth trying, even in alpha. This is a must have for every age of sail fan, it is really promising and full of detail and even if you are not a big fan of sails and cannons i think you could easily become one with this game.The developers know what they're doing and listen to the players in their forums.In game, you start by choosing your player name and nation, then you are brought to the Capital of your faction in the port screen (User Interface is a bit clunky right now, but they are obviously planning to improve it) where you can see your ship, buy equipment, trade, craft items, upgrade your ship and accept missions or simply jump in a random battle room and fight.But if you press Sail you get to the open world, which is really huge, ranging from the northern coast of South America to Florida with the Caribbean Islands in between, of course, and the gulf of mexico, with lots of settlements and places to explore, fight or trade.The various factions in game can conquer settlements belonging to each other, by assembling invasion fleets.Sailing and fighting might seem hard at the beginning. but you will quickly get used to the various keys and maneuvers.And fighting is where this game really shines, with a great level of immersion, nice graphics and awesome sounds (though the game could use a bit of soundtrack and a bit more variety of sounds), learning to maneuver a ship in a battle with many ships, with cannonballs flying over your head is really satisfying and when you manage to sink or capture your first ship it gets even more, the only negative thing about combat i can find personally is the ""text based"" boarding actions, though it's not that bad an idea, but could be improved.So, get the game, find some friends or invite yours and build up a fleet to join the great community already present in Naval Action.

								Great game about age of sail. It's multiplayer focused but Naval Action is closer to open world experience of Eve Online (port conquest battles, huge player lead guilds) than World of Warships tech tree grind. Battles are tactical and realistic but still simply fun, and thats a huge achievement for an alpha state title.If you would ask me about biggest drawback of Naval Action at this time, I would point at W.I.P UI and lack of tutorials. Also   don't expect AC: Black Flag level of graphical fidelity, since game has to handle 50 player controlled ships in battle instance.			"

Even during Sea Trials where all there was is combat I found the game fun, and now with open world there is a lot more to do with crafting and port battles and there will be a whole lot more to do in the future once the devs add more content.Graphics:  The best graphics in a age of sail game each ship is detailed to its real life cosmetics and physics from fore and aft rigged ships to the famous HMS Victory and more ships will be added!   Along with the detail of the ships the open world is also very detail including day and night cycles and dynamic weather.I give this game a big thumbs up because I can only see this game getting better  as time goes on.

								In the last two weeks, I've logged 60 hours. Five of those fourteen days i haven't been able to come on at all, or there has been considerable downtime due to preperation for launch.   In those two weeks, I've lost everything, built it up, lost it again, begun again, and I'm still playing, and loving every minute.  In those two weeks, I've sunk, caught fire, exploded, capsized, run aground, and done much more and worse to other people.  In those two weeks I've felt as close to the age of sail as I ever have, including the time I've spent standing on the decks of two of the ships in the game, HMS Trincomalee and HMS Victory.  I cannot recommend this game enough. It has limited UI, which is being reworked. It has a good playerbase of a few hundred early alpha testers, it already has an active forum and community ingame, and it's beautiful. What it doesn't have, is a difficulty curve. Things are hard at the start, and stay that way, this is not a game for the casual arcade crowd. Don't expect World of Warships, don't expect Black Flag, and you'll enjoy yourself.  It can be played casually, so long as you don't mind going at a steady pace. Large scale PvP battles are available right from the starter vessel upwards, there is no stage in this game at which a player is left out, high level ships are only high level because, just like the real things, they require experience to command and money to build.  TL;DR Version This is Elite Dangerous, in alpha, but with tallships.			"

								After 432 hrs: I highly recommend, with the caveats - that you are an aficionado of The Age of Sail milieu and have a considerable blood-lust for battle.Unlike Assassin's Creed, Black Flag, that was entirely arcade-like in its sailing and battle dynamics, Naval Action endeavors to be more of a sailing simulator and has very sophisticated physics models for ballistics/ ship damage and other ship dynamics. This, combined with very good graphics, cements my interest in the game.For the above mentioned aficionado, this should be enough to enjoy this Alpha release as  it stands.  For others it seems, perhaps wanting more polished nuance, a AAA game team of developers making leaps and strides of breathtaking advancements weekly, may find themselves  disappointed.The UI is rudimentary, the crafting is basically looking at lists that resemble a spreadsheet.  In fact in the lower corner of the screen the developers have a little note the states ‘Please ignore the UI’.  I find this all forgivable at this relatively early stage in development.There are many ships available in the game that you access as your leadership experience advances.  Every ship is modeled to have its unique strengths and weaknesses, this is fleashed out in more detail then you  will ever need at - http://navalaction.wikia.com/wiki/NavalAction_Wikia A recommended site to have bookmarked for quick reference if you play the game.There is no way the game could be at its current state without dedicated passion from the development team.  This gives me great faith that, going forward, we will see the game evolve into an icon of the Age of Sail simulator/ MMO. Again, highly recommended. I have my money’s worth several time over already.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Edit after 600+ hours in gameMy interest in the game is increasing over time.  A rare quality in a game.  The developers continue to tweak the dynamics and add features.  A notable incident that speaks to the character of the development team happened recently when their ISP provider had a technical problem that took the Naval Action servers off line for something like 24 hours or so.  Although it was no fault of the game team, they gave every player in the game a newly developed ship of considerable game-value as compensation.  I have played many AAA MMOs that have been in full release for years and when they have similar server issues that ARE their responsibility, they do nothing, no compensation, not even to paid-up patrons.  So kudos to the Naval Action team.See you in the Caribbean...			"

								Looking at the time I've spent, I can tell you I'm not the most informed about this game.  The only reason it's so low is that I plan on refunding the game, as in it's current state, I'd rather have my £20 back for the summer sale.Is the game bad?  That's not a quesiton I can answer.  The UI is terrible though, and there are no tutorials, so the first 10 minutes of the game are interesting to say the least.  What little of the combat I experienced was ok, but due to me starting in such a small ship, it was lackluster.  I can see it being more fun in larger ships or more versatile ships, but in the starting ship, it's a case of: - Fire right hand side cannon - Turn left side to enemy - attempt to fire/hit - turn away from wind direction - repeatThat doesn't make it bad per se, I just don't want to invest my time in it that much, and this is coming from someone with 500 hours or so in Elite: Dangerous (not through steam if you're checking my playtimes).If you're after an age of sail game, it's worth trying the first 2 hours of your gameplay before you decide to refund or not.But due to the timesink seeming nature, terrible UI with use of hilariously mismatched fonts (it's some modern sans-serif font plastered everwhere for god's sake), I'm refunding it.

								Well what to say:The game is early access (EA) software, so it lacks on content. If you do like mount & Blade mechanics and its map style, there is a high chance you will like this game.It was a disappointment for me, mainly due to combat system. The battles are not shared on world map; instead, it will ""teleport"" you to a battle shard, and the encounter will take place there. I personally think, such mechanics, does destroys the tactical immersion; taking away a bust ammount of possibilities and gameplay.But nothing can be compared with the toxic community. I can handle the game' flaws and EA content, but the toxicity of most of its community is plain and simple disgusting.			"

								Fun game, helpful mature community, awsome ships. If you love the golden era of sail, of iron men and wooden ships, this is the game for you. New content is being added at a good rate and the game has devs that listen to the community. For a game still in Alpha, I give Naval Action a solid 9/10.			"

								As the Early Access moves on, the game changes. Still I can have fun in it:http://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/14676-pvp1-june-the-british-honduras-campaign-pirate-perspective/At €0,04/hour I'm more than satisfied with the return of value, but I sunk (yarrr yarrr) a lot of time in.Now you don't need to invest a lot of time to get a good experience, but you do need to reckon with game sessions that last anywhere between 1.5 and 3 hours. Yes, you can spend 10 or 20 minutes in game, but then you'll never see a battle to the end. In other words, you won't have the opportunity to leave harbor, this missing a huge part of the game.So before you dive in, be prepared that your expectations might not be met. Now or in the final release.Or be open minded and enjoy the experience.So I'm not going say pros/cons, that is something for you to evaluate, but you'll see:- Sandbox (both by design and by lacks of structure)- Realistic Battles- No guidance- Hardcore on a level beyond PvP- Time dilation between strategic and tacticalI forget to mention the potential bugs you might encounter. :blissful_creep:			"

Early Access Review
								I wrote a previous review in which I stated  my ""Negative"" was actually a ""Neutral""This is now a Negative review. Why? Well, I'll try for the first time ever to write a comprehensive reviewGraphics: 6/10This game is stunning to look at. The sea is dynamic and rolling (although I believe they removed storms from the overworld), and the ship models themselves are quite detailed and gorgeous to look at. They obviously did a ♥♥♥♥♥on of research and probably were able to get their hands on the blueprints and measurements for the actual ships. So why so low? Why not an 8 or a 9 or a 10? Well, if you've ever played Empire/Napoleon Total War, you know that ships show heavy damage as they fight; masts fall, holes are torn in the bulkheads, etc. In Naval Action, you can demast a ship, but 'damage' is reflected by pockmarks in the hull, like the bullet holes in Goldeneye 007 (N64). It really takes you out of the moment to realize that 32lb carronades (big honking guns) do no visible damage except for basically scuffing up the paint. It also denies you tactics such as firing grapeshot (think a shotgun blast from a cannon) into holes you blow into the ship to kill crew. Instead, blue bars in the UI show how much of a ship's armor you have destroyed. It feels cheap and isn't satisfying. You may be lucky enough to cause a fire and have an enemy ship explode, but I haven't been that fortunate to witness, so I cannot comment. Also, visible crew is limited to one animated sailor operating each cannon; this is understandable due to framerate issues, but it still looks a tad silly. The 'ports', if you can call them that, are indistiguishable from each other and are visually uninteresting. The user interface, once you enter a port, is a bland and uninspired blue-themed mess that looks like something from Windows 3.1 (Yes, they say they'll have a better UI on release. Yes, it's a lame excuse; take a couple days to whip up some nautical-themed graphics, if only as a placeholder, it *can't* be that hard). So, while the ship models and the sea may be absolutely stunning, everything else just seems cheap, half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and uninspired.Sound: 4/10The cannons boom majestically, but there's no ambience aside from the sea itself; no seagulls, no whale or dolphins, nothing. There is no music, either. Some good sea shanties, epic battle music, or even some Celtic-style stuff that would fit the era would really add a ton of value and enjoyment. I rate this so low because, as the developers for the Total War mods called ""Darthmod"", they added some beautiful and epic music to their mods for Empire and Napoleon, and it's unacceptable that they wouldn't even lift *those* tracks, even as placeholders.Gameplay: 2/10Oh dear, oh dear, what could possibly be wrong? The answer: Everything. This game is the densest time sink you will ever play. It can take hours and hours of real-life time to sail the map, so grouping up with friends or clanmates means you will need to plan *far* in advance if you want to play together. Assigned missions can be up to 30 minutes away (thanks to the rotating wind direction); this, of course, assuming you can even find the missions. There are no tools for the in-game map, so if you want the exact bearing of where you want to go, hold a protractor to your screen; otherwise, you could overshoot your mission marker and waste a large chunk of your life looking for it. Some may say ""But Sluggo, you tool, you have a compass in the overworld which shows your heading!"" To which I reply ""Yeah, but look at where your mission marker is on your map: tell me the exact bearing it's at."" Because, especially if where you're headed is far away, a mere 10 degrees can mean the difference between reaching your objective or getting hopelessly lost. The battles themselves are fun, at first, but quickly grow repetative. There are also port battles, where nations fight to capture ports, but a wonderful mechanic to determine when ports are 'open' for battle means if you're in bed at 3am, you're not fighting.  Speaking of nations, there are 7 historical nations to choose from, plus a Pirate faction. All nations (plus Pirates) have access to the same ships, the only difference being the flag you fly. Pirates, amazingly, are an actual 'nation'; they operate exactly the same way as a real nation, without the high-risk/high-reward bucaneering you may be expecting. You can sail right past a British NPC fleet and they'll politely wave as you sail past; it's disgustingly immersion-breaking. If you're looking for a game where you'll be high-tailing it from Commodore Norrington with a hold full of Aztec gold, look elsewhere. You can choose to become a pirate when you create you character, or simply become a pirate by attacking a ship from your own nation. This is irreversable, as is changing your nation from any nation to anything except Pirate; there are no pardons, letters of marque, etc. So if you would like to be a privateer, er, independent contractor, you're out of luck. The in-game economy is completely broken; clans dominate the economy. The economy in the game is based on shipbulding and material trade, both of which are extremely time consuming as you must sail from port to port to port to collect resources and spend 'labor hours' from a limited pool to craft items and ships.  Because of the wealth amassed by clans, ships which should be worth no more than 100k gold cost millions and millions; anyone who would like to play on their own and not in a clan is at a severe, severe, disadvantage. Aside from battles and economy, there is no other content in this game, and this is where it really falls apart. Visiting ports is pointless as they all look the same; there is no reward for, or need for, exploration or adventure, which, in the Age of Sail, is what this whole era is about. The developers have ruled out the possibility of there ever being a first-person component to this game; if you want to walk around your own ship, look at charts and maps in your cabin, walk around a port, meet your Admiral, participate in deck-to-deck fighting with the enemy captain, look elsewhere, because this game will never have it. The battles quickly become repetative, and all except the most die-hard will grow bored and move on to another game. The contect availbale in no way justifies the price tag. Development on this game has been very, very slow, with no major changes aside from tweaking of damage values; if you're expecting a bigger, better game a year from now, you're not going to get it, because all further contect will be within the limits of the current framework, which is itself extremely limited.  It honestly, truely feels like a proof-of-concept for a few mechanics of a bigger and better game that we're never going to get. I am longer ambivalent in my feelings for this game, and actively discourage anyone who hasn't bought it to not buy it and spend their money elsewhere. The playerbase is abandoning this game in droves with fewer than 700 average players, per steamcharts.com, and it continues to fall. In a few months I predict this game will be dead and just another failed Unity-engine project.Not only to the developrs of Naval Action, but to the gaming 'industry' in general: This early-alpha-pre-access-beta-test-for-us-and-give-us-money extravaganza needs to stop. Now.			"

								Did not play this game much. Because of steam sale and the general athmosphere around this game, it seemed like a great thing. I couldn't be more wrong. The interface is horrible, everything is time consuming and except from the beautiful scenery, nothing is fun. This is all to be expected from an alpha release. Unfortunately I only read that nothing much has changed to this game for 4 months after buying it. I do not expect this ever to turn in something good at this rate.			"

Early Access Review
								This game has alot potential and it can be fun but there are alot of flaws and issues as well if the direction of the game continues to go a certain way.A big thing is the game at the moment isn't new player friendly. You'll to do your research on the forums for guides (assuming they are even up to date since the game is constantly in flux and most aren't) and look up wiki info.Leveling up, you can find fun playing against the NPCs in your tiered boats but the moment the player aspect is added it changes the dynamics.The culprit being is damage model 5.0: Smaller cannon calibers have a harder time penetrating thicker armor which gets bigger and bigger the higher tier ships you face against.If a cannon ball can't penetrate the armor, it bounces and richochets off doing nothing to the enemy. This renders smaller ship PvP/PvE against bigger ships time wasting and unfun in its current form.To add more to this, you have get a 90 degree angle shot for most of them broadsides to get your damage to penetrate as well.It like World of Tank's damage model, but on a hardcore grinding gaming model.I'm coming from playing other sailing games which I was able to bring my knowledge and relate to how they did this in Naval Action which I caught on quick, but I could already see if it was from the perspective of an average player that picks up this game they wouldn't be able to enjoy it.I just can't recommend this game. I would wait for a few months before buying it to see what direction they take it.Realism is good but is way on the border line of too much realism.Alot of stuff is still being tested, but new additions of content in the game currently being done aren't up to par to addressing its current issues.

								Although Naval Action has some flaws, there are still many reasons to play. First, for an early access game, Naval Action is very well polished and recieves substantial updates and bug fixes each month. The devs are really good at listening to the community and making necessary changes. Along with that, the community is great dispite its small size. There are plety of new players joining the community every week and many will happy to travel and fight along side you in both PvP and PvE. The combat is the main attraction for Naval Action and is realistic and challenging. There are a few problems that will likely be addressed in future updates. The open world travel is painfully slow and the world is massive. Most of the time you will spend is around your own coastal ports. In addition, there isn't a ton of variety in the combat, which is made worse by the long grind required to reach the higher ranks. For me, getting money is the easy part and you will certainly be able to by a first rate before you have the men to crew it. This is because the amount of crew you can have is dictated by your rank. One last thing is that I really recommend playing this with friends as it cuts down on some of the boring grind. Overall, I recommend Naval Action despite its flaws. You have to remember that this is still early access and has been around for only a short time. The updates every month are refreshing and make noticable changes. For under $60, this game is tremendous fun for anyone interested in the age of sail.			"

Early Access Review
								Absolutely not.  This game has a lot of potential but frankly I am sick and tired of these 'Early Release' games being offered (especially for $40) that can't even be played.  Since when did customers become paying play testers?  This game could be great if it was a finished game but it has crippling bugs.  For instance, you can't even stay on the damn server.  I don't know how many times I have been painfully floating around (it is sailing after all) to finally engage someone in combat just to be kicked out.  Then sign back in and do it over and over again.  Even worse is getting into combat, fighting it out for 30 minutes and then get kicked out again, basically wasting your time.  This is utter nonsense.  Beautiful environment and the ships themselves look classy.  But knowing this is going to be a slower paced game and expecting that, it is far too frustrating to play when you keep getting booted.  After googling it to see if perhaps I was having a hardware issue or connectivity problem I found I am certainly not the only one.  If it is a game still in production and you want player input (admirable) that is great.  But stop making us pay to playtest your half baked games.			"

								After playing 80 hours, I really truly want to like this game. The combat is excellent but the meat of the game is making money which is accomplished by trading which is done by an intuitive list of goods to buy and sell for various prices. All is well and good until you realize the time spent traveling between ports which takes FOREVER and then there's no guarantee you make any profit for the amount of effort and time involved. Most people will find this game frustrating and give up. I haven't quite given up but the game needs quite a bit of work so that normal people with jobs and families can get something out of this game without dedicating their lives to it.			"

								This game is visually beautiful, and by far the best representation of 18th century Naval Warfare I have come across. The sound effects and graphics in fights really make it come alive.Both PVE and PVP is catered for, with the potential for huge scale fights in both instances. It does take time to get used to the mechanics of the game and the combat is not super fast paced (which is right for the time period) so this may put off some people. If you are at all into this period of History or just like cannons and ships in gerneral you should really give this a try. It's early access but the Devs really do impliment changes based on feedback and fairly quickly and regularly too. They're doing a fantastic job and an increased player base would go a long way to making their job easier! So they can turn an already great game into something incredible			"

								I have been following this game way before it was on steam such as closed alpha and the design and gameplay was fun there and still now I enjoy the time when I do get to play. Though I have not had many hours on steam with real life, put plenty of time in closed alpha and enjoy the aspect of it. The developers are working hard on this and they listen to the community so much. Gameplay: The ships have a nice balance between action and simulation. Wind profile and hull design are taken into account... and improving all the time as the game devlops. Available nations to sail for are; USA, Britain, France, Denmark, Holland, Spain, Sweeden, and infamous Pirates!Combat: Can is very fun in the open world and seeing how things handle! The ships handle well in combat and can be sunk or caprtured in battle, and via several difernt methods!Comunity / Moderators; Ive been playing this game since it began in closed alpha... these guys in game are some of the funnest and funniest players around! The community has been more than fun to work and play with and able to voice opinion easily. Pros: Immersive sandbox world of immense proportions! Good sounds. Good variety of ships to buy/craft/steal. Ecconomics for those who want to be a trader captain. Fun and lively group, most of whom respect skilled players and are very noob friendly. Port battles for the war mongerers... stealing ships for the pirate inclined fellows.Cons: Still some growing pains in combat mechanics, some things get out of balance. The ability to have AI ships escorting players dilutes the PVP experience.			"

Early Access Review
								I've purchased this game quite recently at the time of posting this review, and the negative reviews posted right before did make me waiver. I'd like to go over why I am so happy that I decided to try the game for those that waiver as I do.I've played Sid Meier's Pirates for well over 1k hours before it was added to steam, this game sort of comes across as a much more in depth MMO version of that. Choose a nation, participate in PvE missions (small and large scale), capture ports of Pirates or other nations for your nation, fight people or capture traders/player ships in the open world, participate in a player driven economy. All of these aspects of the game accompanied by fantastic feeling combat and a true sense of accomplishment along the way, something I've found missing in a lot of games.It's true that you don't show up as an X on the map, and must use your compass as well as landmarks to get around. I have yet to get lost (perhaps other than a couple minutes of questioning my exact location), and honestly navigation feels great and after a day of playing I could find missions far off of land easily.There are several nations as well as pirates, and each one feels like a unique community. As you play throughout the day you see server wide messages of port battles, cities being conquered, you see in global chat people mentioning huge expensive ships being captured by pirates. The world feels alive, actions seem to matter and when you see a first rate ship sail by or you see people taking part in these huge battles with huge perma-loss risks and rewards, it excites a new player to want to continue.I already feel part of a national effort, I already feel a sense of accomplishment after getting a new ship and crafting enough to make a lot of gold. The combat feels fantastic, and though 10+ minutes may feel slow to a lot of people for missions, it never feels artificially slow. Each mission is still fun to me, fleet missions feel rewarding and sailing back to port with the risk of pirates jumping me and taking all of my rewards is honestly fun to me. (though very rare, but the possibility is there)I'm very happy that I'm playing this game, though it seemed hard at first it very quickly became a fluid and fun experience. Though people said missions were super slow, nothing has felt anything but natural and entertaining. This is a game that feels rewarding, the faction system makes me feel like I'm a contributing member and honestly this is the pirate game I've been wanting for years. I hope the development keeps going strong and adding more, but either way I've already gotten more out of this than a lot of games and plan on continuing for quite a while.Currently as of writing this, the best advice I was given before playing was to pick EU PvP 1, even as a North American player. There is no noticeable ping in game, especially with the slower pace, and the national politics and action make for a great playing experience.  A definite recommend in its current state, May 20th*, subject to change of course.			"

								All I can say is this game is awesome. I have put many hours into this game and it's hard to loose interest since there's so much to do. Naval Action kind of reminds me of POTBS meets a warship simulator. It's still in alpha, but it's pretty solid with very few bugs.General rundown-You start out by picking one of 8 nations. British, America, Spain, Dutch, Danish, Sweden, French, or Pirates(Pirates are #1). You start out in a little cutter and work your way up from there. The more you level the more crew you can have under your command. You can get into any ship, but until you can fully crew it you are at a disadvatage. There is a good crafting system, economy system, huge port battles, epic battle events, dueling, planned events, exploration, fishing, and even the ability to pray. There is a pretty big time sink involved. It takes awhile to get around the open world. On PvP servers(which is the best way to go) you can always be attacked by other nations. The community(at least on PvP2) is great. If you enjoyed POTBS, World of Tanks, or EVE you will probably enjoy this game.			"

All that is needed is more content and depth, the trading system could be managed better than it currently is, especially on PVP where all the markets are saturated with goods and opportunities to make money are few and far between, its a harsh environment but challenging at the same time, which appeals to some.Overall 8.5/10 atm.....

								This game is informative, relaxing, beautiful and sometimes a bit nerve-wracking.Mature players, good natured community and on-going developments make it a pleasure to be part of.The UI is plain and there's little tutorial in the pre-release, but the in-game chat/forums/wikki provide all that's needed to progress. Team Speak essential for best participation in battles.			"

								Naval action is just a great game, .... still in developpement, but with a great potentialGood stuff : FIRST, the developer team is small, but actually listening A LOT the community regarding developpement and suggestion. The bad part is sometime they release some strange things, to test alternative ideas , not always good, but they really listen, and do not fear to deeply change the gamplay if the community ask for it. Played a lot of early access games, in this one, your voice is heard :) Naval combat : realstic, but not boring, a very nice balance between simulation and arcade, with simple controls, but a lot of tactics (wind, rolling angle etc...), and combat is slower than in world of warship for example, much more tactical, forcing player to be smart and carefulGraphics : Graphics are truly very nice, they lack a little bit of life (not a lot of crew viewable on board right now) , but are still great, especially smoke / waters and ships models who are just great, and better than any other naval gamesOpen world : Huge open world, truly beautiful, with realistic map of all the carribeansCrafting : still in developpement, but very interesting, with a lot of sub components needing various ressources, buyable or lootable in Open world. Any crafting path is actually realistic with realistic sub components. Bad stuff : The way combat is initiated is actually not yet ready, there is a time compression in open world, and battles are fought in real time, , so the mechanism to enter or join an instance to join a battle is actually not enjoyable, leading to sevral exploits, and sometime a lack of ""Fair"" PVP situations. Developers are aware of this, and actually discuss with the community to find a proper solutionAlliance and Politics : This part is actually being patched and more developped, so there is good hope in the near future to have something more exiting, more like EVE online on the seas.Trading : not specially exciting ... as it should be I guess ? :)Time : the game like any MMO is very time consuming, even more ... A single combat versus another player can last for 30 minutes, huge battles 2 hours almost, combat is not too slow, nor boring , but playing with the wind, cannon reloading , is taking time, and let's be honest, this game is a time sink ! Conclusion :  Exellent game, with hopefully a lot of bad stuff disappearing patch after patch, with a lot of potential, realism, politics, alliance, PVP, PVE .... A huge and endless sea opening in front of you !  "

								If you're looking for a game with excruciatingly detailed naval combat mechanics, everything from needing to turn the yardarms appropriately to the wind to accelerate a turn, to devastating raking shots that slaughter crew, damage cannons, and damage key components such as the rudder, pump, and powder magazine, then this is quite simply the only option available. Unlike something like World of Warships, you can take charge of nearly every aspect of commanding your ship, whether it be commanding crew to abandon their posts in the rigging and move to the gun decks to help reload and aim the guns, or aiming and firing each deck of guns individually. Conversely, there is a very nice balance there, in that you can set the skipper to auto, at which point the position and turning of the yards will be handled automatically, if somewhat simplistically, allowing you to focus on other aspects of the combat. The economy is heavily driven by the players, in that every ship you will sail of any quality or of a rate higher than 4th was created and sold by a player. Those ship crafters need materials to build those ships, and those materials need to be themselves assembled from raw resources gathered both by trading routes sailed by players between different cities and different islands, or by farms, mines, and forests owned and controlled by players. Frankly there's a reason that so much of the playerbase is composed of former and current EVE players; there is an appeal to games with such depth that is difficult to satisfy elsewhere.			"

								The game is good. Leveling is a bit grindy and will take a minimum of 2 months of straight up repetivite gameplay to get even close to a ship of the line. The game is very social, and if you choose to get involved the nations politics, your character will become known to those in and out of your faction. I have nearly 600 hours played, and of those hours, maybe 100 of them are actual combat with an even lesser number of the total in pvp. The majority of your time in game will be spent travelling, and doing nothing. If you do get this game I suggest you get your movie playlists in order.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Above is what I wrote originally. While the above statements are still somewhat true, alot has changed. It still takes alot of time to level up. The politics in the game have changed completely, and is no longer a pit of social decay. I have 1000+ hours of gameplay now, and I still watch movies when I'm sailing. I realized when I wrote the above (about 6 months before this edit) that I was totally engrossed by the game. I didn't keep coming back because the game was perfect and polished, all shiny and chrome. I kept coming back because this dev team is so damn good!The changes to the game, was done by the dev team listening to the feedback the community gave to them. They listen to everyone, and everyone who registerred to the site (the site's registration mechanics is basically a dumbass filter btw) gave constructive criticisms, and were able to vote in the direction they wanted the game to take. The directions that were available were all compiled based on what the community asked for.I changed my review because the dev team is one of the best in the indie game industry and their quality of work is some of the best I've seen from an indie developer, and it keeps me coming back for more!

								First off, I am somewhat biased because I EFFING LOVE SHIPS. If I could go back in time and join the Royal Navy I would. I know the life was rough but the ships are so freaking awesome.Anyway, this game is like a wet dream for me (no pun intended). I think there is still a lot of room for improvement but so far this game has really satisfied the need for a game centered around these type of old world naval combat.The grind is REAL. XP does not come quickly or in large batches but you quickly become lost in the immersive details of the game. You literally have to run your ship and pay attention to everything that is going on. This game is almost like the DARK SOULS of boat games. It takes time, a lot of work and patience, but when you see those 3rd rates riding around decimating people left and right you know it is all worth it.My notes to the devs:-  More XP per PVE battle would be nice. it is 1000xp to the first rank after you start and ~50xp per battle is brutally slow especially when the battles can go on for over an hour (especially when the AI jerkoff bot keeps riding into the wind)- Add collisions while roaming the open world. Force people to pay attention at all time. this would of course you to stop loading ships on top of each other as well.- If you are in Sailing mode during battle I don't see why your ship wouldn't maintain the same speeds it does in the open world. Everything should be consistent. I would understand a penalty while being in another mode during battle.- Please add the spyscope/telescope view to open world!- When zoomed all the way in on the starting cutter the mast is directly in the middle of the view- Better tutorial in the beginning. I had no idea how to earn XP or what to do other than drive the ship. Took a lot of outside research to figure out main objectives. I don't mind a challenge and figuring stuff out but i spent the better part of my first couple hours just riding around in the open sea aimlessly not knowing what to do.- YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB KEEP IT UP YOU ARE MAKING MY CHILDHOOD FANTASIES COME TRUE			"

								Very impressed with this game so far, in early access. The combat similation is absolutely top notch for an Age of Sail game, and certainly many players who have been looking for a similar title to Pirates of the Burning Sea will find a new home here. As I write this the game is pretty barebones apart from the combat areas, but entirely functional, and stunningly beautiful. Combat is simply sublime. The developers are active on their forums and take their heading from the community as to what the focus of the upcoming patches should be. New ships to be included are submitted and voted on by the community and are then pushed through to development. I really, honestly, don't have any major complaints to make about the game in its present state, I think the only thing major that needs to be addressed is the inclusion of some form of tutorial, as you do see in the in-game help channel a lot of new players a little confused about the same topics over and over again. Thankfully however the community is both welcoming and helpful, and seem entirely happy to patiently help you as you take your first steps (and mis-steps!) in the in-game world. The Basic Cutter starter ship is free anyway, and losses are to be expected as you learn the ropes! Its a fun process anyway, and rewarding when you get to grips with it. I find the the game has a certain feeling of satisfaction to it when you win a fight that you should otherwise, by rights have lost, only to prevail due to your skill at handling your ship. In that regard, it is definately a rewarding game.Literally cannot tear myself away from it right now, its very good.			"

I know the life was rough but the ships are so freaking awesome.Anyway, this game is like a wet dream for me (no pun intended). I think there is still a lot of room for improvement but so far this game has really satisfied the need for a game centered around these type of old world naval combat.The grind is REAL. XP does not come quickly or in large batches but you quickly become lost in the immersive details of the game. You literally have to run your ship and pay attention to everything that is going on. This game is almost like the DARK SOULS of boat games. It takes time, a lot of work and patience, but when you see those 3rd rates riding around decimating people left and right you know it is all worth it.My notes to the devs:-  More XP per PVE battle would be nice. it is 1000xp to the first rank after you start and ~50xp per battle is brutally slow especially when the battles can go on for over an hour (especially when the AI jerkoff bot keeps riding into the wind)- Add collisions while roaming the open world. Force people to pay attention at all time. this would of course you to stop loading ships on top of each other as well.- If you are in Sailing mode during battle I don't see why your ship wouldn't maintain the same speeds it does in the open world. Everything should be consistent. I would understand a penalty while being in another mode during battle.- Please add the spyscope/telescope view to open world!- When zoomed all the way in on the starting cutter the mast is directly in the middle of the view- Better tutorial in the beginning. I had no idea how to earn XP or what to do other than drive the ship. Took a lot of outside research to figure out main objectives. I don't mind a challenge and figuring stuff out but i spent the better part of my first couple hours just riding around in the open sea aimlessly not knowing what to do.- YOU ARE DOING A GOOD JOB KEEP IT UP YOU ARE MAKING MY CHILDHOOD FANTASIES COME TRUE			"

								First, this is an early access game, and the game is early access as i am writing this so the game will most likely change.From my experience, this game has a great potential. It really focuses on realistic naval combat.This game really reminds me of Uncharted Waters Online.The game has a very unique mmorpg consept that is hard to come by. It's definately not a finished game though. It needs work still. But as of now, it's looking good ;)			"

								Very impressed with this game so far, in early access. The combat similation is absolutely top notch for an Age of Sail game, and certainly many players who have been looking for a similar title to Pirates of the Burning Sea will find a new home here. As I write this the game is pretty barebones apart from the combat areas, but entirely functional, and stunningly beautiful. Combat is simply sublime. The developers are active on their forums and take their heading from the community as to what the focus of the upcoming patches should be. New ships to be included are submitted and voted on by the community and are then pushed through to development. I really, honestly, don't have any major complaints to make about the game in its present state, I think the only thing major that needs to be addressed is the inclusion of some form of tutorial, as you do see in the in-game help channel a lot of new players a little confused about the same topics over and over again. Thankfully however the community is both welcoming and helpful, and seem entirely happy to patiently help you as you take your first steps (and mis-steps!) in the in-game world. The Basic Cutter starter ship is free anyway, and losses are to be expected as you learn the ropes! Its a fun process anyway, and rewarding when you get to grips with it. I find the the game has a certain feeling of satisfaction to it when you win a fight that you should otherwise, by rights have lost, only to prevail due to your skill at handling your ship. In that regard, it is definately a rewarding game.Literally cannot tear myself away from it right now, its very good.			"

								Amazing game, I have little time on this game but the Battles and just Everything about this game meets my needs for an amazing ship game. I would Recomend this game if you are a Fan of open World and Real life Battle tatics. The map is huge and it's like Eve Online with the Whole fly through space and Get to another star system but your in a Ship and you can't warp you need to sail. I like it. Took me 3 hours to get from Port royal to George Town to start a war but well worth it!			"

								Can't say enough good about the game.  Can go on for pages with positive aspects.  It's not for the faint of heart, nor can you expect to ""get it"" or become an expert within a few or several hours.  It takes time and practice and persistence, but it is well worth it.  The battles are intense and wind direction is quite real....>_<  As this says this is an ""Alpha"" stage deployment, things will change as far as development structure, but the core of the game is here to stay.

								This game is one for the history buffs, one for the gamers, and one for people just looking for fun social interaction online.  I'm not only all of the above, but also a fan of the Patrick O'Brian novels in which the ship HMS Surprise features prominently.  I originally joined this game with the sole intent of sailing that ship, which I'm happy to say I have done so.  The only problem I have with this game is it is addicting.  I find myself waking up in the morning and needing to check in on my historic world.  I highly recommend this game.  I think I'll be playing it for years to come.			"

								Naval Action Early Access Review, Grade : Captain, written at around 350 hours of game-time.Pros- An unique open sea battle simulation. The (few) naval battles games that exist can't get close to the gameplay, realism and beauty of this game.- Combat is really well done. Every tactical option is here : 3 different ammunitions, crew management, advanced sails management with wind direction, different kind of canons, different kind of ships and possible strategies...- Very enjoyable with a group of friends, large or small. As it is a PVP designed game, you'll enjoy the thrill of naval action together. If you don't have a group though.... you'll get ganked !- A very large map. It easily takes half a day of sailing to get through one point to another !- Devs are very engaged on this game, and close to the community. They often reply on the official forums. Tired of AAA game devs ? Here they're really awesome.- Port battles are going to be awesome once they'll release... forts. But from the previews it'll be epic !- No subscription, no cash shop ! It's basically a MMO like the first guild wars, Buy to Play. Price is OK for the content.Negatives- Open sea mechanics are still new, and not very well designed. Trouble to find enemies that don't run, trouble to find missions... ports are conquered way too easily etc... That will change but the actual state of the open world is bad.- Grind is real. I didn't grind much, as I like to experience quite a lot of different things in the game, and after 350 hours I'd have thought to have end-game ships. Not really ! I am yet to unlock constitution and 3rd rates. So brace yourselve if you're a casual player that don't like grinding, you might never experience the end game anytime soon. - The game is a sandbox, and is definitely unbalanced on small servers. Choose your faction wisely if you don't like to fight with unfair (impossible) odds.- Crafting system is terrible as it is purely based on RNG, but hopefully it will change next patch.- UI is awful, as it is a placeorder. This will change before release.- Customisation is missing : no character or portrait, no ship cosmetic customisation. But that will likely change before release.- You keep combat XP forever, but devs will maybe/probably reset everything else before release. You've been warned. Nothing is final yet.Overall : 7/10 if you have a group of friends or meet nice players in game. If you are also a fan about ships of the golden age of sail it gets to  9/10, THIS GAME IS FOR YOU. If you're a casual solo player : 4/10. Unless you want to play in group on a regular basis, this game has not much to offer to you.Final verdict : RecommendedThe game is unique in its genre and should definitely be in your library if you like simulation of early 19th century sea battles. I repeat, this is not an arcade games and it is realistic to a certain extent, while not being a full simulation. The pace is slow, but needs skills.  If you like or don't mind simulation-paced games, then consider the followings :The open sea mechanics are bad, but the excellent combat mechanics more than make up for it. Open world is still recent though, and the game will only get better until release. Devs seem to be very engaged at keeping work on this game, and don't really care about money.Also, this is a PVP game before everything, and to enjoy it you need to group and grind at least a little. If you don't mind both of these requirements, then it is definitely a good game. It is still far from being perfect, but worth it even right now. Then, if you're a fan about naval battles don't hesitate. You'll probably love the game.If the devs fix the open world mechanics and keep putting more content, I'd recommend it even for casual players.			"

								2000hrs on :)Well at 1st I really like the comunity, but did not take long for their true colours to show.What a bunch of whiney mofos. No wunder the devs chop and change the game around to try and keep them happy, which they never are lol.The game now seems overdone to me. I still like the PvP side of it, but not the hostile/toxic global chat spam. Thank god for mute. No matter how they try and even up the game in regards to teams/nations, they just can't keep it simple. If ppl wont join an out numbered nation force it on them. The game is only good when there is somebody to fight. As it stands now ppl go 3 ways Pirate, Great Britian or US. Which leaves 4 other nation with hardly any players. To make things worst US\GB\Dutch are allies lolol Which are the 3 most populated nations, aside from Pirate that are not a nation as such.All they had to do is give each nation 10 sustainable ports. That could not be capped.Nice simple system, but instead they complicate things so much ppl have left the game in droves.The Trade system is over done and unbalanced and unnescesary. It just seems the more they do the worst it gets. Its a shame the Devs can't make their own game instead of making the game certian players want. I think the Devs should not be playing the game with clan groups and stop showing what seams to be favs with nations. May not be the case, but sure as♥♥♥♥♥♥seams like that. As the game is right now I cannot recommend this game anymore.			"

								Coming from someone who played a great deal of PotBS, and any game that was about the age of sail, this game hits well above expectations. I have all settings set to the highest level. And they are stunning. The game has an immense amount of potential and the current price tag is completely reasonably. Whether you are soloing or grouping, whether you prefer pvp or pve, this game will keep ship lovers enthralled for a long time. Especially promised content of crew control and better trade\production possibilities, combined with more ships. I personally play on PVE, but I play with friends occasionally on pvp and the fact u keep experience across servers is an awesome feature.I'd personally rate this game at 8.5/10 only thing I would love is to create a captain and have him standing at the helm during battles, but perhaps they could do something like that in the future!I highly recommend you to buy this game!

								This is probably one of the best games I've played in years. I may be biased, as the Age of Sail is one of my favorite eras in history, but the game is a lot of fun even without the kind of nerdish attention to detail I apply to this genre.It has a bit of a learning curve, and being this early in development, the UI needs some work, but that's coming. The devs have been very communicative with the community, so we're always in the loop on what's coming next.If you like sailing tall ships and filling your enemies ships with cannonballs, you can't go wrong with Naval Action.

Early Access Review
								Yes, this is an early access game that are unfinished. But is it fun to play as it is now? The answer to that is absolutely yes. The core gameplay is there. Trading mechanics is working fine, and battles are fantastic. It runs smoothly too as long as you dont enable AA. There is a lot of things i expect to be improved. But as an early access review i wont deduct points for that. This is not a finished game. Join now, and be a part of the community that shapes a naval warfare game with huge potential. There is no tutorial, but we are very helpful in ""help"" chat in the game. There is also tutorial videos on youtube. What you need to know is that it is no arcadish game. You aim and shoot manually, the navigation is done with a map and use of compass. You dont appear as a dot on it. But there is a great community with many good guilds to join and be a part of. The big ones offer voice chat(Teamspeak). And we have great fun warring other nations for ports and control of the high seas.Conclusion is that the base game is there. And it is absolutely fun, and that i think, is the only thing that should matter in a early access. Its not perfect(yet) but i hope its going to be, and everyone that supports the developers buying in at this stage, will contribute in making it so. I wrote this review with 45.5 hrs played in game.			"

								An absolutely stunning example of a Naval ""Age of Sail"" simulation game, which has no rivals. The Graphics are excellent, the Gameplay is improving (as its early access!) and the game dynamics are extreemly good. This is what PotBS should have been (but was not), andf takes Age of Sail 2 to a whole new level. A warning though, its realistic...so no map update...you will have to use judgement and dead reckoning...or make a compass....just like in the 18th/19th Century....Enjoy.			"

								The community is a very welcomeing and helpful place, even though the game has no tutorial, not all of it is foriegn. The only thing that is taking me time to get used to is the gunnery and boarding mechanics, other than that its a quick learn and people are willing to join each other and form fleets to assist in missions or capturing ships.  There is a PvE server (which i am currently on) that is a good way to get your sea legs with the game before going onto PvP if desired. ALL who are even slightly interested in this game should aquire it and join.			"

								Naval Action is a unique and beautifully made game that gives you complete freedom over your destiny, you take your role as a captain in the west indies during the age of sail, you may simply want to trade or like me take enemy ships your prize.The community is greatly helpful and i spent my first few hours talking to more experienced captains who were talking me through what I could take in my starter Yatch. After a few more hours I got to grips with navigation and once I worked out where I was I had to rely on map and compass, no player location marker in this game im afraid, you are forced to learn and adapt in this wonderful world.After basing my now upgraded yatch at kingston I operate in 5 day tours in which I will go into enemy waters, take a prize and bring it back into kingston for my own gain. I am under the flag of the UK which means I mainly attack French and Spanish ships, attacking an English ship would make me a pirate!I would recommend this game if you are intrested in the Naval history of this time and have an appetite for the learning curve, however you will not enjoy your experience if you are not willing to listen to more experienced players.Thankyou for Reading!

Furthermore the chats really Help yout out. I cant understand why some ppl say they dont (maybe they went on a low pop server).			"

								This game is more then just a game. It is an experience, and not one to be missed.I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute of playing this game. Sure, I was a bit frustrated with some of the gameplay at times, but that was my own fault. Naval Action takes a bit of time to get used to the mechanics, but it is no where as bad as EVE Online's learning requirment. Playing a few battles here and there will get you caught up to speed with how the game needs you to play.I was part of the Early Alpha of the game that you could only fight/battle (AKA Sea Trials), and even then I enjoyed the gameplay. Since the ""Open World"" segment was released, I have enjoyed it even more. During the Sea Trials, you were put into a arena to bombard your enemies with balls made of iron, however it was not a arena of land. No, you fought on a large sea map, with small islands that dotted the horizon, while other times you were surrounded by mountainous land formations.This game may be created in the Unity game engine, but the team at Game-Labs has done a increadible job making the game look beautiful and play well. I hear many developers complain about how the Unity engine looks terrible, but Game-Labs has created a game to show just the opposite of what many devs think of Unity. The boats you sail and fight in look stunning and the environments are just as good.When this game releases, I hope that many people give it a chance, because those who choose not to will be missing out dearly.

								Coming from someone who played a great deal of PotBS, and any game that was about the age of sail, this game hits well above expectations. I have all settings set to the highest level. And they are stunning. The game has an immense amount of potential and the current price tag is completely reasonably. Whether you are soloing or grouping, whether you prefer pvp or pve, this game will keep ship lovers enthralled for a long time. Especially promised content of crew control and better trade\production possibilities, combined with more ships. I personally play on PVE, but I play with friends occasionally on pvp and the fact u keep experience across servers is an awesome feature.I'd personally rate this game at 8.5/10 only thing I would love is to create a captain and have him standing at the helm during battles, but perhaps they could do something like that in the future!I highly recommend you to buy this game!

								This is probably one of the best games I've played in years. I may be biased, as the Age of Sail is one of my favorite eras in history, but the game is a lot of fun even without the kind of nerdish attention to detail I apply to this genre.It has a bit of a learning curve, and being this early in development, the UI needs some work, but that's coming. The devs have been very communicative with the community, so we're always in the loop on what's coming next.If you like sailing tall ships and filling your enemies ships with cannonballs, you can't go wrong with Naval Action.

								This has the potential to be an incredibly awesome game with elements of strategy tacics,crafting, economics and player driven politics all rolled into one seamless product. While i am leery of early release games, Naval Action's early release Alpha is remarkable and generally bug free. The game is not for redbull drinking FPS clicker  heroes but rather for peopel who take the time to become sillful within a game system. The investment of time is very rewarding IMO.PVP and PVE are represented in this game and neither is to be taken lightly.( How well can YOU tread water?). There are communities developing for both. If You are a mature, patient gamer who loves a beautiful game, this may well be one for the years for you. "

								Despite still being in early access, it is already one of the most beautiful games I ve ever played. It is an unforgiving game, a mistake during a battle can turn the tides completely, and a course badly plotted, without considering wind shifts or dangerous zones, could make a 30 min voyage last an hour. But Naval Action doesn´t rush you like other multiplayer games and gives you the freedom to play it at your own time. It´s not hard to recover your losses, and you learn very quickly from the mistakes you make.While playing I also haven´t felt a lot of pressure to level up. It´s as fun to play with a Privateer or with a Small Trader, as with the huge ships that require higher experience. Small ships are fast and can escape easily from those monstrous floating fortresses, while making fast attacks on vulnerable slow traders. Big ships are more challenging but really powerful and fun to play.One time I was hunting for Brtish traders. When an enemy player with a frigate appeared in my line of sight, he immediately started to chase me. I was several miles of the coast, but south of my position was an island with a huge area of shallow waters surrounding it. So I, sailing on a Brig and with a huge disadvantage of firepower, and with the enemy controlling the wind, decided to run to this waters where the frigate couldn´t enter. My plan worked perfectly, the frigate once near this waters had to desist the chase.But then, I realized several other enemy players were expecting me near the island, tired of running I let them engage me, 8v1, I manage to give them a big punch, but they were smart, destroyed my masts and sank me. Totally worth it.Naval Action is a game that requires patience and planning. But at the same time gives you accelerating and fun moments.Before you buy, is important that you realize it is still early access, so a there are plenty of things that aren´t finished or polished. But the developers are extremely aware of the players comments and ideas, wich is fantastic.			"

								If you are somewhat into Naval Combat, pick this game up. Also, if you are not so far, you might still like it (as it was the case for me).A lot of early access reviews that are positive say something like ""the game has potential"". That's not the argument in the case of Naval Action. Yes, it has potential, but it also already lives up to it. Nice graphics, the core gameplay mechanics are already fleshed out (general ship movement, combat...).It's already in a well playable state, it just gets filled with more content on regular basis.The game also has a growing economy part (trading & crafting), so if you don't want to be fighting all the time, there is still something to do for you.

								This is hands down the best age of sail game I have ever seen or heard about. As with any EA game there are growing pains as it gets closer to full release, yet the dev's do seem to listen to the player base when they can. This game is not the easiest to learn nor master. I have experianced intense adrenaline rushes in the PvP, and epic sails that last that seem to last forever. This is not a game for the casual gamer in my opinion. For those who are looking for a satisfying combat experiance in the age of sail, this is the game to check out. My advise to any one interested in this game is to check out some YOU-Tube vidieos and make an educated choice.			"

There is grind, the Open World is huge and therefore the sailing distances are huge. A single PvP fight can last 2 hours and chasing ships can last hours. That being said, it is currently my favorite game. It looks gorgeous, the sound is good and everything just ""feels right"", from the thunderous sounds of your cannons to the smoke obscuring the sight. This is by far the best Alpha i have ever played.			"

								I know a lot of people having been giving this game a thumbs down and I get it. Although the devs want to make a realistic naval game set in 16-17th century they aren't focusing on the 'fun' aspect of the game. The devs keep adding more mechanics to make it realistic (which is fine) but they don't focus enough on things to make the game more fun to play. When I say fun I mean more things to do other than trading, crafting, and fighting in battles. Although these things especially combat can be fun it does get repetitive at times. There are also other issues with nations/pvp (Pirates are OP)Now other than the things I mentioned above the game is actually a very good game. I started off in a basic cutter with only 12 guns and worked my way up to a 1st rate ship with over 100 guns. Right now i'm currently in a trading bussiness making 300k gold a day. I love being able to sail around the west indies to all the different ports (keep in mind sailing can take hours because of the scale of the game and you can often get lost) and fighting and plundering enemy ships. The game is very realistic, it looks very realistic and has great graphics, and the combat is the best over any other naval game. Trading and everything else needs some work. If you love naval history, sailing, or being a drunken sailor then I have to reccomend this game. Although every game has issues this one has a lot of playablity and you will get a lot of hours out of it.7.5/10  "

								Well, while I used to recommend buying this game, I cant at this point.It was a simulation, and now for ""balance"" have even broken the rules of physics.long cannons that fire the same 6 pound projectile as medium cannons, at a higher velocity... somehow now do less damage than the cannons that fire the projectile at a lower velocity..AI have turned into snipers.. they can hit your modules (water pump, rudder, etc) with alarming regularity. The chances of you hitting on of their modules are staggering. Enough so, that you will feel very lucky when you actually hit one.I will re-make this reveiw if and when they fix the game, which I expect they will.. but Im not going to hold my breath.=======================Original review below===============    This game is classic naval battles. Rolling seas, winds, sails, cannon aiming and your skill at managing these will go into each shot or broadside you send to the enemy. Aim for their sails with chain to try to demast their ship or shred as much of their sails as possible to slow them down. Or, aim for their water line with ball or double ball to open up some holes and let some water in. Aim for their crew with grapeshot to widdle their numbers prior to boarding. Your choices, your skill, your guile, your ship make the difference between success in battle and a wattery grave.      You start out on a small ship, with a few crew. The world is open, your oyster to pluck pearls from. You can trade with other ports, set up proffitable routes and make your money as a trader. Or, you can fight battles for your nation, earning money and skill in naval combat. You can hunt down pirates and smugglers, taking their cargo for your own. Or, you can be a Pirate! Hunt down enemy ships, fight, board and steal their cargo, commandier their cargo ship and bring it back into harbor to sell or use as you see fit.     Dedicated PvP and PvE servers allow you to play with as much (or as little) player interaction as you desire.    I started out on a PvE server, playing with a buddy. We learned to sail, shoot, fight, craft on the PvE and eventually, we longed for a battle against other players. The fights with AI are fun and definitly worth the practice of battle, but the fight against another human controlled ship, who can make mistakes, fool you with their guile, surprise you with their speedy ship, or just beg you to spare their ship and cargo from your plunderous ways, make the game exciting and very playable.   This game is in early access, and as such, is constantly being developed. Each week or so are updates that improve, expand or occasionally break things. But that is to be expected in an early access game.   I have played several early access games and this is one of the better ones because you can instanly file bug reports from within the game and the developers actually listen.   I cant wait to see what this game will eventually become, but at this point, I do recommend it to friends.			"

								If you are not looking for productions that requires some sacrifices in order to have fun, dont buy this game. You will only waste your money. BUT, if you are a patient man and you love the climate of the age of sails, that's something for you. Every travel even between two close ports takes at least 10 minuts and this is the big disadvantage of the Naval Action. The ""action"" word should be removed from the title cause the speed of this production is really slow. In fact, about 80% of time you will have to spend on travelling (especially now, when the developers removed the ""taxi"" option) between battles, events etc. Fortunately, everything changes when you enter the battle.The viev of max. 50 (!) beatifully detailed naval ships shooting hundreds of cannonballs in each other just amazed me. The falling masts and exploding ships are seen hardly ever, but even without them battles are really realistic and beautiful. The combats are the strongest advantage of this production.The optimalization is mediocre. On my PC (i5 4440, 8GB RAM, GeForce 650 GTX Ti) i have about 25-35 fps in Open World and 30-50 fps in battle with HD resolution and everything set on low except the water (medium) and trees. Also i noticed really interesting thing: whem I set all settings on a maximum lvl, I have about 5-10fps in Open World and about 15-20fps in battle, so there is a chance that they will improve it and even weaker PCs will be able to run this game.And that's all. You have to decide if you will like the hours of sailing in OW for one exciting battle. But thrust me - in my opinion it is worth it.			"

								I have had a lot of fun playing this game, there are still some little issues due to the fact its Early Access, you occasionally find bugs and strange things happening, graphics are also not optimised yet. The game itself has 3 core elements right now, trading, crafting and battles, each of these features have their own fun and challenge to them. The game can be played PVE or PVP, with most people playing PVP, I prefer PVE. Currently You can play one of 8 nations; Britain, France, USA, Denmark-Norway, Sweden, The Dutch, Pirates and Neutral, although Neutral is a bit lacklustre right now and Britain is vastly overpopulated.The mechanics are similar to that of Assasins Creed: Black Flag and Empire/Napoleon Total war naval battles, feeling more like the naval battles from the two total war games, going beyond their level of realism. You can control sails individually or have it automatically done for you. As a warning the game does not handhold, currently there are no tutorials and the UI hasn't been properly implemented yet, but the community is very welcoming and people are happy to answer questions to anyone on the in game chat, people are also often happy to show you the ropes of battle against an NPC to help you get started too.The Future of the game includes a monthly update, adding new features and with a very active and engaging development team who do their best to take in suggestions and answer questions both on their own forums and the steam discussions page.Personally I thoroughly enjoy the game, and will be keeping a close eye on it into the future, playing along with each period, checking out new features and being involved with the develpment as much as I can. If it continues on the trend it is on then I expect it to be one of my all time favorite games, I am glad to support it and praise it highly. "

								This game does exactly what it means to; and that is, fulfills the desire of everyone with an interest in the age of sail to captain their own ship and venture the high seas of the Caribbean and Atlantic coast. Despite being early access, it's relatively content complete insofar as the open world is available. People have called the game ""EVE:Online at sea"", take of that what you will.Combat is instanced and content complete. If you've ever played the naval battles in Empire: Total War it's pretty similar to that. Although there's an auto Skipper, it pays to learn how to manage your sails as the wind is fully simulated. This game probably has the most realistically simulated water I've seen in a game too, as waves can rock a ship and knock your cannons' line of fire. You can switch your cannonballs out for chain shot to demast your enemy's sails and follow that up with grapeshot to knock out their crew enough for a successful boarding. You can even ram them if you're feeling particularly cavalier, I once got lucky and capsized someone's ship but I doubt that happens as much with the bigger hulls.I look foward to seeing what else the developers have in store for this game, so far they've promised a better economy and enhanced inter-factional diplomacy. For now I'd have to say it's one of the few impulse buys I actually didn't end up regretting.			"

								This game is really terrific.  It captures the essence of naval combat in the Age of Sail.  Tactics are complex and nuanced, and fighting does not become repetitious.   The open world is beautifully rendered, and the ships are also gorgeous.  There is a nice balance of PVP and PVE action, and the game caters to those who like PVP but doesn't really lend itself to griefers.  I have played quite a bit of EVE Online.  So far, I really prefer Naval Action, if for no other reason than the combat is a lot more engaging.    Can't recommned this game highly enough, especially for anyone who loves the Age of Sail.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is early access, let's start there.  There are bugs.  There will be changes.I have participated in this game since the Sea Trials a year or two back.  The combat has continuously gotten more detailed, and new features have been added.  The economy, for now, seems to closely mirror that of Pirates of the Burning Sea.  The combat focuses on realism wherever possible.The map is huge.  It takes hours to sail from one end of the Caribbean to the other.  The conquest mechanics are in development still, but the foundations are there, and seem to work well.  Each nation seeks to localize and then dominate their area, with forays out into other territory.  All is driven by control and commerce.If your inspiration comes from the likes of Patrick O'Brian or C.S. Forester, this game is for you.  If you want to zip around and rehash Pirates of the Caribbean, it probably isn't.----------------------------There is another review on here that Ant has put up, with a lot of negative comments for it.  I wrote this in response, and had it spread over four comments due to a 1000 character limit.  He opted to delete it, with no response.  It is unsurprising he deletes any comments that disagree with him so that he creates this aura of agreement.  It is a shame that Steam allows one to do so.  Now, I edit my own review to save it for posterity:You have to wonder why someone would spend so much time bashing a game, instead of listing a review and moving on. The feedback could be useful, but, from what I gather, this user has decided to remove any the development team's direct feedback on the game, right here, rather than letting people leave their comments and have a productive discussion.That said, this player has decided to try to do exactly what he accuses others of doing: Silencing those of differing opinions. Let us address this review point by point:He cites that there is nothing to due, as there are not enough people sailing around. Yet, it would be interesting to figure out just where this player was sailing. There is plenty of traffic in the Antilles. There is plenty of traffic around Cuba/Haiti. There are quieter zones as well, such as the Gulf.He states that the massive grind is a huge turn-off, yet... there is no need to grind. Smaller vessels are viable, as are larger ones. The Lynx, the lowest ranked vessel in the game, is great for running down Trader's Lynxes, which are what people run their high-value cargo in (due to their high speed upwind). Concerns of optimization and lack of UI are curious, as it is an alpha game, where optimization is towards the end, and UI will be worked on once the features themselves are in. The developers have said this themselves.Content patches are generally monthly, with new patch notes for October already posted. New ships are regularly added, new mission types are in this patch, forts along coast lines are in this patch, land in OW battles has been in for some time, and land in port battles is still coming. A ""lack of content"" seems to me to simply say, ""I want it all, and I want it now.""The playerbase has contracted from peak times when huge content patches were added. This is shocking to none. In a lull period between patches, the game still hovers around 800 players at peak hours, and 400 players at off-peak hours. In an alpha game. As far as microtransactions go, I believe they are still working on that, with potential changes to come. I do not believe anything is finalized yet.The ultimate concerns of this player comes down to the developer staff, and in particular, one person. Simply put, Ant doesn't like admin, and seems to have made it his goal to do a character assassination of him, and of the game. He still brings it up regularly, and tries to make an issue out of it. And yet, the key thing this player was complaining about is being added in this month's patch anyway.Maybe this player wants to have an honest assessment of the game. Maybe he has the integrity to allow for a differing view. We'll know that he does if this response is still here in a week or two.If he simply deletes it, well, then we know he just has an ax to grind, and should be given that level of concern.			"

								The game works now, I had to reinstall the game and turn my antivirus off. Game is fun, however gets a little boring during sailing. But it doesnt matter because I usually just watch something while playing. Disclaimer: this game is very hard and you should only buy it if you enjoy old time naval combat, this game is for you.			"

								Well, while I used to recommend buying this game, I cant at this point.It was a simulation, and now for ""balance"" have even broken the rules of physics.long cannons that fire the same 6 pound projectile as medium cannons, at a higher velocity... somehow now do less damage than the cannons that fire the projectile at a lower velocity..AI have turned into snipers.. they can hit your modules (water pump, rudder, etc) with alarming regularity. The chances of you hitting on of their modules are staggering. Enough so, that you will feel very lucky when you actually hit one.I will re-make this reveiw if and when they fix the game, which I expect they will.. but Im not going to hold my breath.=======================Original review below===============    This game is classic naval battles. Rolling seas, winds, sails, cannon aiming and your skill at managing these will go into each shot or broadside you send to the enemy. Aim for their sails with chain to try to demast their ship or shred as much of their sails as possible to slow them down. Or, aim for their water line with ball or double ball to open up some holes and let some water in. Aim for their crew with grapeshot to widdle their numbers prior to boarding. Your choices, your skill, your guile, your ship make the difference between success in battle and a wattery grave.      You start out on a small ship, with a few crew. The world is open, your oyster to pluck pearls from. You can trade with other ports, set up proffitable routes and make your money as a trader. Or, you can fight battles for your nation, earning money and skill in naval combat. You can hunt down pirates and smugglers, taking their cargo for your own. Or, you can be a Pirate! Hunt down enemy ships, fight, board and steal their cargo, commandier their cargo ship and bring it back into harbor to sell or use as you see fit.     Dedicated PvP and PvE servers allow you to play with as much (or as little) player interaction as you desire.    I started out on a PvE server, playing with a buddy. We learned to sail, shoot, fight, craft on the PvE and eventually, we longed for a battle against other players. The fights with AI are fun and definitly worth the practice of battle, but the fight against another human controlled ship, who can make mistakes, fool you with their guile, surprise you with their speedy ship, or just beg you to spare their ship and cargo from your plunderous ways, make the game exciting and very playable.   This game is in early access, and as such, is constantly being developed. Each week or so are updates that improve, expand or occasionally break things. But that is to be expected in an early access game.   I have played several early access games and this is one of the better ones because you can instanly file bug reports from within the game and the developers actually listen.   I cant wait to see what this game will eventually become, but at this point, I do recommend it to friends.			"

								It's pretty much a more ""realistic"" / simulation-type genre of what if ""Sid Meier's Pirates"" was to be modernized.Looks pretty.I recommend getting this game, but I'd wait it out a bit for the UI to get fleshed out and (hopefully for my own preferance) a bit more arcade-y controls as an option.Other than that, it's a game that has lots of potential. Whenever it gets more cosmetic customization to stand out it'll be much cooler.			"

Early Access Review
								Naval Action is a very addictive, slow-paced, deep game with plenty to do that all comes together to make for a very enjoyable experience that is best enjoyed in a group.As it stands now, only about a week out of Early Acess, Naval Action is a healthy, promising game with a friendly and invested playerbase. The game focuses a lot on basing its mechanics on players' actions in the game world, and as such you can expect to see a vibrant world form as a result. The game's features are still being fleshed out so there is certainly still room to give players more control over the world they play in, but you see from developer's responses on the forums that they plan to give players the tools we need to make this world ours.So what can you do exactly in Naval Action's giant sandbox? First off, you can fight basic battles with AI. These battles usually come in the form of 'missions', or Naval Action's equivalent to a quest. Missions simply order you to defeat the enemy at a given random location in the sea in exchange for bonus XP and gold. These rather mundane missions are the mainstay of the grinding experience for most players as it is a straightforward way to progress and gain the experience and gold needed to get the next best ship. Battles with the AI can also come in the form of hunting down AI trader ships or patrol fleets by yourself or with a group. Engaging with traders is a good way to try and make some money by “commandeering” valuable goods or ships, and engaging with patrols is a good way to get yourself killed; unless you bring friends.You can also of course fight with other players. You can do organized PvP in the form of Small or Large battle queues that you sign up for every few minutes in any port, or you can hunt down players in the open world. You can also participate in large port battles with other players against other players to wrest control over cities and the resources they provide.And of course, you can trade and craft in order to make lots of money. These latter options require a lot of knowledge and time to do right, but can pay in dividends. It is also important to note here that any decent ships you might wish to command must be player-made, and crafting ships is no small task. The economy of this game is one of great potential for the budding capitalist.Combat as a whole is very well done in Naval Action. It is deep and too complex to go into detail here, but know that this is no arcade style ship game. It is slow paced, but can be incredibly intense, especially in PvP and in large battles. Ships are detailed and well designed, the open world is a delight to sail in, and there are plenty of friends and enemies to be made playing this game. I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone interested in games like EvE that maybe are looking for something more than context menus in their combat scenarios.			"

Early Access Review
								Naval Action is a hard core, age of sail naval warfare pseudo-simulator, emphasis on the Hard Core. Firstly, it nails the whole alone on the ocean feel (when you get away from busy ports). Part of the gameplay is learning to navigate using only a map and compass. If you're looking for a real Age of Sail feeling type of game, this is it.What Naval Action is not: easy. Naval Action isn't a Pirates of the Caribbean game and takes basically no cues from the movie franchise. Naval Action is more like Master & Commander than Pirates of the Caribbean. You could hunt a single enemy player for hours before engaging in an hour-long gunnery duel and boarding action. Speaking of fighting, the combat is challenging, but fair, and the game doesn't try and hold your hand when you start. It takes a while to learn how to fight with the wind dictating your movement and with guns that have poor accuracy and slow moving projectiles, but nothing is as satisfying as landing a complete broadside and watching your enemy's armor become Swiss Cheese.Notice that I said Pseudo-Simulator. It's hard to be an actual simulator and be fun, so there are some player gimmes, like teleporting between cities, but more complicated sailing manuevers such as controlling your yards individually and the accurate sailing model give a sense of complexity missing from other naval themed games. However, there are two major caveats that Game-Labs gave up: The first is that you never have to sail at true speed throughout the Caribbean. There's an Open World overmap which you'll probably spend most of your time. In the Open World, the entire map is available for you to journey to but you can't fight in it and can't interact fully with your ship, and time goes faster, which in turn makes it seem like you aren't travelling at a snail's pace across the absolutely massive Open World map. When you reach a battle (either by attacking or being attacked), you'll transfer to a tactical Battle map where you move a true speed at true time and most of the simulator elements become available. If you've ever played Star Trek Online, think Sector Space vs. System Space. The other caveat is that it is always windy. You'll never get stuck in doldrums or without a breeze, either in the strategic Open World overmap or in an instanced Battles. But that doesn't mean you can go in any direction you please, you still can't travel directly upwind, though fore-and-aft rigged ships will travel faster close-hauled than square-riggers. Yeah, you'll get to (or really, *have* to) learn some nautical sailing terms in this game, too.The game is hard, and relatively unforgiving if you just think you can walk in and trounce the first enemy you see. Tactical planning is much more important that twitchy skill or APM. That being said, there are a ton of guides on the Game-Labs forums that will help you out on avoiding the major mistakes many players make. For good measure, I'll give you a first bit of advice: Don't go British.Good Sailing, Captain!			"

								First time reviewing a game simply because I enjoy this game immensely even in it's alpha stage and want to help it grow and flourish.  If you enjoy team tactics, ""Eve style"" MMO strategy/diplomacy, naval warfare, age of sail history, pirates, beautiful graphics or any of the above I highly recommend you check out Naval Action.  Even in it's alpha stage the replayability and fun is undeniable.  This game is also much more approachable than Eve (not to knock Eve, also a great game) but still presents a lot of the same dynamics that make this genre so much fun.  Plus, combat is not simply clicking the right guy at the right time but involves ""twitch"" reflexes, accuracy and in general is more instinctive.  Even though the ships are often going slowly when you factor in managing your crew, getting off cannon broadsides/chaser shots, factoring the wind/adjusting sails all the while not trying to hit anyone (on your team at least ;D)... you are never not calculating or focussing on what you're doing.  10/10!

It kind of reminds me of an old game from a long gone company ( Avalon Hill ) based on the same subject matter.  It was called ""Wooden Ships & Iron Men"".

There are many things you can do in this game, you can be pirates, traders, and more! There is PVP, and PVE. AI is very well programmed too, when i first started off playing this game i could not even tell who was real and who was computer!Graphics again, are amazing for alpha!

								Naval Action is not a perfect game.  It's still unpolished, with a rough UI, grindy and clunky level progression, repetative missions.  They just throw new players in, with no explanations or direction.  Obtaining even a moderate size ship is the result of many long hours of combat.  Battles are slow, with small ones taking 30 minutes and larger battles nearer to 90.  Sailing a ship to a distant port can take literal hours of tacking against the wind, with no navigational hints or visible land at where you are in the vast carribean, left guessing your position.Yet still, this is the best game I have played in a very long time.  Just a few months ago, before I knew of this game, and in the middle of the Aubrey Maturin series, I found myself wondering ""Why isn't there a good, multiplayer age of sail game?""  I asked my friends, and they all agreed this was strangely missing from the world.Naval Action is everything I had hoped for.  The games slow pace means that combat, particularly PvP, is high stakes and suspenseful.  Rushing in towards an enemy, closing the distance while their broadsides crash into your ship unanswered, only to swing around at the last second and run yardarm-to-yardarm beside them, firing your carronades loaded with grape shot onto their decks as they bear, and boarding them in the smoke, is potentially one of the most gratifying experiences that modern gaming has to offer, with the possible exception of large battles.Imagine 40 ships, some of them with over 100 massive cannons, running with wind, all firing at the enemy fleet at the same size a quarter mile away. closing in to a chaotic 80 ship melee at close quarters, blinded by thick clouds of smoke, fighting both sides of your ship while trying desperately not to smash head-on into friends and foes alike.  This routine occurrance is one of the most epic sights I have ever encounted in any videogame.I have found myself wary of Early Access games as of late, due to abandonment or extremely bad development decisions.  But not here, the devs seem to pay attention to player's input, and the game, though unfinished, is already in a very playable state.  Though there is not much 'content' as far as missions go, the sheer fun and complexity inherent in sailing battles keep it fresh, and skill very much matters, as a more experienced player in a smaller ship could win through maneuvering and tactics alone.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you like the age of sail, and are looking for a game to sink quite a bit of time into, this is it.			"

								I have played many games to a very high skill cap and this game in my opinion is amazing.  Its very in debth age of sail game that got the little things right.  You can be what you want trader, builder, exploreer, and open sea hunter as well.  I played Pirates of the Burning Sea back around 2009 and loved that game, much of the princples of that game are being implemented here.  The open world pvp is epic and the portbattle system as well.  Its not a instant gratification game like most people of my generation like, some battles can take over a hour, you have to earn your damage and kill.  If your at all into a open world pvp enviroment with high stakes and high skill pvp this is the game for you.  And its only in ALPHA AND ITS THIS GOOD.  Can't wait to see what it becomes.

								Naval Action is not a perfect game.  It's still unpolished, with a rough UI, grindy and clunky level progression, repetative missions.  They just throw new players in, with no explanations or direction.  Obtaining even a moderate size ship is the result of many long hours of combat.  Battles are slow, with small ones taking 30 minutes and larger battles nearer to 90.  Sailing a ship to a distant port can take literal hours of tacking against the wind, with no navigational hints or visible land at where you are in the vast carribean, left guessing your position.Yet still, this is the best game I have played in a very long time.  Just a few months ago, before I knew of this game, and in the middle of the Aubrey Maturin series, I found myself wondering ""Why isn't there a good, multiplayer age of sail game?""  I asked my friends, and they all agreed this was strangely missing from the world.Naval Action is everything I had hoped for.  The games slow pace means that combat, particularly PvP, is high stakes and suspenseful.  Rushing in towards an enemy, closing the distance while their broadsides crash into your ship unanswered, only to swing around at the last second and run yardarm-to-yardarm beside them, firing your carronades loaded with grape shot onto their decks as they bear, and boarding them in the smoke, is potentially one of the most gratifying experiences that modern gaming has to offer, with the possible exception of large battles.Imagine 40 ships, some of them with over 100 massive cannons, running with wind, all firing at the enemy fleet at the same size a quarter mile away. closing in to a chaotic 80 ship melee at close quarters, blinded by thick clouds of smoke, fighting both sides of your ship while trying desperately not to smash head-on into friends and foes alike.  This routine occurrance is one of the most epic sights I have ever encounted in any videogame.I have found myself wary of Early Access games as of late, due to abandonment or extremely bad development decisions.  But not here, the devs seem to pay attention to player's input, and the game, though unfinished, is already in a very playable state.  Though there is not much 'content' as far as missions go, the sheer fun and complexity inherent in sailing battles keep it fresh, and skill very much matters, as a more experienced player in a smaller ship could win through maneuvering and tactics alone.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you like the age of sail, and are looking for a game to sink quite a bit of time into, this is it.			"

								This game shows a lot of promise. at time of writing this is still very much in alpha - true alpha rather than one of those perpetual in development games. but the combat is still very fun and enjoyable, especially in larger battles.The open world is still in an early stage and there is not  lot of content yet in terms of things to do in the open word, but it has a solid foundation. there is still quite a bit of entertainment found in in having larger battles so it is worth trying if you like your naval action!

								You would be hard pressed to find a more accurate age-of-sail game, and this is coming from the perspective of someone who has real life experience with square riggers.  The game mechanics in Naval Action are sufficiently realistic that you will find yourself using tried-and-true historical maneuvers.That being said, the developers have managed to execute this rich realism in such a way that it is intuitive and easy to learn.  You can jump right in and start sinking ships, without first reading a treatise on sail theory.			"

								The actual battles are Realistic and the gfx are outstanding. This is not ur normal point and shoot and you will hit guarenteed game. You will have to see the ship out of the actual smoke first then you will have to know your guns are they short ,medium or long range  how high do you have to aim are you going for the ship it self or do you want to tear down the sails or go for the crew afterwards its up to you when you have desided all that you will also have to watch out for the waves when shooting (defently a more realistic factor wich i enjoy)First impression of this game is amazing! Will be nice when servers capability will be increased.			"

								Good game.  There's crafting components & ships; there's trading up and down coastlines; and there's combat, both individial and group based.  The real fun is finding the balance between these three competing dictates.  The initial grind is hard and boring but is as needs must for you to become a competent captain.  Find a clan, learn the secrets and amass the cash & experience necessary to become a captain of a first rate ship of the line.  Plenty of forum and youtube available to learn the basics and gain proficiency.  In port (non ship) based UI is drab and boring, but is obviously only a placeholder.  Only negative is the 1hr server restart every day at 0700 hrs UTC.  Why they need this leftover from late '90's gaming is a mystery, but there it is.  One of the more expensive Early Access games out there, but certainly has it's addictive side.  You can easily find yourself 100 hours in barely a 3rd of the way to MOAR CANNONS.			"

								The game is released as an alpha access, and it shows. On top of that, they peddle it for 39.99. The game is said to be a beautiful realistic experience, but most of it is portrayed in spreadsheet type layouts. The layouts spill over the sides of my moniter when set in its native resolution so that I can't read costs correctly, the UI is very wonky and seems to have little organization involved. Having said these things, the combat, once you learn how to do it, is quite realistic and a bit fun. The combat is definitely what this game has going for it.Overall the game didn't meet the expectations it sets, and the only thing justifying the purchase at the 40$ price tag is promise of the game costing more in the future for content which might be developed in the future.I sent in a refund request and hope it gets fulfilled because I could spend 10$ on Sid Meier's Pirates! and get a much more exciting, immersive, fun game set in the 'most beautiful period of naval history - when sailing ships ruled the seas.'I wanted this game to be good, but it's just not there, and it's not worth 40$ as is.

The game around that is what's taking time to build but trust me, it's worth it and there is continual progress.			"

								I've been playing this game for about 40.7 hours in approximately one week. This is a testement to how much I really enjoy playing the game.At first I simply came for the combat, and did not really expect much from an alpha game. But in reality the combat is already fleshed out, it works great!The MMO aspects of the game works 'okayish'. In my opinion there needs to be added a bit more content, and a few tweaks to make it all work, but hey? It's alpha, so I bet it's going to be great in the end.The game needs a tutorial for new players, but the help section in the chat is filled with helpful players, so if you want to learn anything, just ask there. The Fantastic player base is this alpha mmo's strongest point, together with the wonderful combat.			"

								Don't be scared by the scary looking requirements to run the game. If you have a decent PC then you should be fine. The graphics are beyond this world, and like nothing I've ever seen. If anyone plays, or used to play Pirates of the Burning Sea from SOE, I think you'll definitely enjoy Naval Action. INCREDIBLE ship models so real it's like I'm looking at the real thing. Since Naval Action is still in Alpha, I wouldn't be too critical on things. Many features still have yet to be added, and many bugs will come along the way. That goes for any game in alpha stage. If you're like me, then you're excited to see where this game goes, and the future of Naval Action.			"

Graphics look nice and the audio is great. i would maybe like to see a soundtrack introduced though. But i must say, it is the least polished most buggy early access game ive ever played. Bugs are to be expected in these titles, however, the games are usually playable. Game time is dictated by daily server maintenance, server population and whether the game is in a good mood. Day one took over an hour to get into a server, day two saw mental screen tear after every battle and today? the client crashes after 5 seconds and i am unable to get on atall. when they say early access, they mean it. I will recommend this for the game i WANT it to be, not for what it is. bear that in mind. "

Early Access Review
								Note: I've had Naval Action since very shorty after the closed beta started. I've played off and on since then, but I'm not an expert by any stretch of the imagination.Naval Action is a game about the 'Age of Sail' that lasted from the 17th-18th centuries. You take command of any one of a number of sailing vessels, starting from cutters and yachts, to the largest Man-O-War. Most ship classes are named for ships that actually existed (you can't rename them as of now, and I don't know if that's planned), and a few from more realistic fiction also fill the roster. they can hold different numbers and sizes of gun, larger crews, reinforced planking, and all manner of other upgrades to set them up for your tastes. Nothing exists at the moment to change them astecticly, however.As these are sailing ships, the weather  (naimly the wind) can be your best freind, or worst nightmare. if you have to head northwest, and the wind is coming out fo the northwest, it's going to be a long and slow slog up to your destination. Learning how to use the wind to your advantage will be the hardest challenge you face in Naval Action. You ship can take damage, and if shots hit below the water line, you're liable to start leaking. Masts can be shot off, rudders damaged, and crew can be killed with grapeshot from the ship's guns, Sails can be shredded to ribbons with chain-shot.The game itself has a map that encompases the whole of the Carribiean, and parts of North and South America. There are ports for a number of nations, all of them currently at war, as well as ports where any ship may enter. There's Pirate ports (I've yet to find Nassau, though D:)  and Pirates coming out of them. You'll start off by sinking (or if you can manage it, capturing) these pirates, before venturing out to wage war with the other nations, or trading valuble (and sometimes illegal) commodities thoughout the world.It's a game best left for the patient, it takes me a good half hour to get to Cuba from Charleston, and another ten mintues to get to Hati or Jamaica. The overworld map is pretty large, to say the least.the graphics in this game are top-notch when in combat-mode, though are a bit simpler when in the overworld. The menus are far from complete (though even they have come quite a ways). The sound is suprisingly good for a yet-to-be-finished title. Get yourself a good set of headphones, and you'll be sucked in, with the sounds oc water and creaking wood in between the smoky roar of your deck guns.Pros:-The game is quite realistic - Wind makes a difference, and you can use it to your advantage.-Looks georgious while in combat.-Sounds georgious while in combat.-You can sail the Suprise.-Bigger ships do not always trump smaller ships (get on the stern of a frigate, and have the wind on him, and you can happily rake him in the backside all day long).-PvE options for people to learn on, but while XP transfers to PvP Gold doesn't seem to (a nice tradeoff IMHO)-Gives me a reason for having a whole playlist of Sea Shanites (Which I liked before I even knew about the game).-You can get large numbers of players together for large naval battles, when everyone knows what they're doing, ti's a sight to behold.-The Developers are really active in the community, and seem to enjoy us enjoying the game, which is nice.-A large number of nations to choose from, depending on how you want to start out, and what you want your ship's flad to look like.Cons:-Realisim means that you can't go directly into the wind like AC4, you'll have to learn how to tack (this isn't as much of an issue for those who have sailed before like myself, but newcomers might want to watch a few tutorials Which I might even make a few myself)-Larger ships with square-sails are complex to operate for the newcomer.-No ship insurance built into the game as of yet.-Not every command can be re-bound. The functions of the number keys come to mind, how I'd LOVE to set up a custom joystick to handle that instead, but it's a bit less conveiniant then I'd like for that.-the overworld doesn't look quite as pretty as combat, and you will be spending time in the overworld a lot.-no spyglass in the overworld, where you'd realllllly like to have it-not optimized, which is to be expected, but those of you who cannot stand anything less then 60 FPS, turn back now.

Early Access Review
								The Age of Sail game that serious PC gamers have been waiting for.It isn´t for casual gamers, the scale of the map is huge and navigation takes a significant amount of time.The combat is excellent, and with each update every aspect of ship warfare is simulated with increasing fidelity.There are a lot of people reviewing the game prematurely, or at least without any real understanding of the concept of early access, or certain decisions made with regard to the business model. 99% of these reviews are uninformed drivel. It becomes apparent very quickly that Naval Action is a labour of love, each ship is beautifully crafted in a way that honours the real world originals, the combat is intense, lumbering, yet somehow despite that slower pace is always edge-of-your-seat split-second decision making. Quite the feat really.Most of the negative comments here come from the fact that the developers have decided to sell ´premium ships´ in order to pay for the very high capacity servers. Seems perfectly reasonable once you look at the details and reality, as opposed to simply get all hot under the collar because you want everything in life for free. The game world is huge, and to support that many players on one or two servers requires income other than the initial sales. The game is very reasonably priced, and there is no subscription fee. These ships aren´t pay-to-win. Stat-wise, they will be more or less the same as the normal ships, and unlike premium vehicles in other games it is possible to lose them (they can be sunk four times before they are permenantly lost). Seems reasonable enough to me.Another reason some of the uninformed masses have complained here, seems to be the fact that there are no ingame tutorials or anything. It´s early access! All efforts are currently being directed towards creating and improving game mechanics. The UI, filler and content like more ship types will follow. Currently they are releasing minimum one new ship design per month.If you understand this, then this game might be worth looking at in its current state. For all others, stay away from our baby.			"

								I'm a long tester of Naval Action, way before these fancy things was implanted into the game, and I really appreciate the developers for making such game, the devs are also very nice and listening to the community very well! They want the game to be best, naval game. In this game there are no level restrictions, there are ranks yes, but imagine in real life too you didn't start out as a captain of FIrst Rate, maybe only in Empire Total War! :) If you like this era as much as I do, and would like to be some sort of ""reenacting"" the era, this game is for you! The high seas are waiting! :D			"

								Does sailing around on a high quality naval vessel appeal to you? Engaging in port battles, trade runs and ship to ship combat against both NPCs and other players (on PvP designated realms)? Then this could have been the game for you!Unfortunately a number of features let it down such as the world map scaling with the ships so a trip to Honduras from Jamaica takes the same amount of time it would take a ship travelling at the same speed in the real world.This is further hampered by storms with zero visibility (sailing past obscured ports at 100m is common) and that there is no marker on the map for either your position or that of your group members. Travel is done by zig-zagging between ports based on compass bearings and combat navigation is done in degrees from north.Due to recent changes, resource acquision is now entirely player based in a world where 90% of the 300 population server is in the capital and most of the other 100 destinations have no resources to trade. Combat harks from AC Black Flag with crew management detracting from the combat experience (try choosing between sails, gunnery and boarding while in combat)Overall this game is no longer worth the $40 price tag. If you're still interested wait for the full release and keep an eye on the reviews at launch			"

								I have played many alpha and beta games over the years, so I absolutely understand this game is not yet complete.  That being said, paying $40 for its current condition is in no way justifiable.It is a great concept as I have always liked naval warfare games.  A lot of effort was put into the combat and the graphics, while fun, it overly slow.  I know they are trying for realism, but if I had put that many cannon balls into that tiny starter ship for real, it would be toothpicks.  The rest of the game, looong way to go.  I hope the devs keep at it cause this could be a great game, but if you are on the fence about this, don't waste your time or money.  I will be requesting a refund and watching the games progression, but I won't be paying for it again or playing it any time soon.			"

								I have been following the development of Naval Action since early alpha.If the idea of open world realistically simulated 18th century sailing ships is your thing this game is definitely the one to check out. Quick Disclaimer: For people expecting arcadey Assasin's Creed IV - Black Flag gameplay - look elsewhere, this is not a game for you.However if you don't mind the steep learning curve, and being sunk multiple times while learning how to fight an accurately modeled, painfully detailed sailing ship, how to tack into the wind, and sail using compass and stars, this is definitely a game for you.Community is excellent, gameplay is fun, open world is beautiful and massive. If you would like to see more, check out some of the videos i made of the game (although taken at alpha - sea trials stage)


YouTube™ Video: Naval Action - Beautiful Age of Sail - First Look 

			Views: 4,212		

			This is a first look at the alfa for a game called Naval Action. A beautifully designed open world Naval Combat game set in the Age of Sail when big sailing ships roamed the high seas.		

That being said, this is the Early accces game in the full sense of the word. Towns business, main gui, crafting, trading and anything apart from sailing, and battles is extremely basic. Most of the UIs are placeholders. Those that expect port business like in Sid Meier's Pirates will be disappointed for some time.However the feeling of sailing the beautifully crafted open world and engaging in hectic sea battles either vs players or the AI, and mastering the sails is bar to none yet seen in this genre.This game is one of the very few in early access that i wholeheartedly recommend to all sailing ship enthusiasts.

								I really want to like Naval Action, but this game just loves wasting your time. You will spend 90% of your time just travelling from one place to another, staring at a completely uninteresting horizon the entire way.And I mean for every single combat mission you take, you will literally spend almost 10 minutes travelling, each way, for very little reward. The grind is awful in this game, and the travel time between destinations just makes it unbearable.The ship combat is solid, but it's really not enough to save the game.			"

								This game at first was, well, amazing. Then after a few updates and nothing was added, nothing was changed, I was over it. During the time that I played it, there were only two factions that had people in them. The British and the United States were the only factions with a good amount of people in them. There needs to be some sort of balancing mechanic in the game, and it will make it good. The rest were left to rot, and die a slow death. The combat mechanics are good, and the sailing is pretty realistic. IDK if it's still like this, but last time I played, they shut down the NA servers, and only kept the EU servers open. Was such a let down, and honestly a waste of money. I wish I could've returned it and got my money back. I am going to blackmark anything that comes from these developers.			"

								It is a more realistic version of POTBS, but that has its pros and cons.  The gameplay is much like POTBS;for those that played it and enjoyed it, this is probably a game for you to consider.  The physics are much more realistic than the more arcade nature of POTBS (angles of attack matter, ships list, waves, ricochets, etc.) however so is ship handling and battle length.  This game has a lot of potential, but considering the amount of time it takes to travel in the open world, and the amount of time a single battle takes, if you don't regularly have uninterupted blocks of playtime 4hrs or longer, you probably won't be able to do much in this game.  Currently ports are just menu screens, which seems like something this game falls drastically short of compared to POTBS.  A lack of any kind of initial in game guide compounds the difficulty of the game, but that can be fixed by watching/reading online guides.  It looks like a good game, but I can't recommend it due to the amount of time doing anything takes.			"

								We all have changes now. That is sad.Thise game have potentioal and with last patch it have been showing that new gameplay contents as fishing, officers and all gives the game a new aspect off playing. before start to play and hope for action it takes some time before you rank up to be able to do the fun parts as pvp or portbattles. it is a age of sail game so it is slow. can take 2-5 houers only to sail if you going to get a new bace away from home waters. You can sail have some pve battles ( good to rank up and geting gold), PVP ( have fun with players from diffrent nations), port battles ( take a port from the enemy nation), fishing ( get food =cash and a chanse to get a bottle that leads to a ship wreck). craft materials, uppgrades, ships, do traiding with own nation ports or the rest of the nations that is in the game by puting on a smuggler flag. if you take in it is under making and you can stand a game that is slow and love age of sail ships of the line then thise is a game for you. but if you like fast game that all is going to happend now. then you are not going to play thise game.But I recommend the game after playing it day for 4 months.

								I really struggled whether i would recommend this game or not.For now I would still recommend the game itself, but not the current status.My recommendation: Wait till the next big patch and check it out again. (Please also see my UPDATE-notes)Also pay close attention to the reviews. The ratio of downvotes is off by far regarding the negative reviews, but best make up your own mind.Here is my approach:☸ ☠☠☠ Introduction ☠☠☠ ☸Starting in 2003 with Pirates of the Caribbean by Bethesda with I was obsessed by sailing games. Although the game got the franchise forced on it - which you really could feel - I was hooked from the first minute on. On the lookout for some mods to make the experience some kind smoother, it was Naval Action which caught my attention instead. The time I discovered it was still in greenlight status and yet I was eager to play it from the looks of the impressive pictures.I started my journey in Naval Action in early February and sank a bunch of hours so here is my attempt to give you an overview of the game BUT let me tell you from the start: If you are short on Playtime each day, this game might not be the one for you.☸ ☠☠☠ Gameplay ☠☠☠ ☸The grind to the top is hard and time-consuming but working your way up you learn more and more about the game - cooperating with other players helps immensely. It has a very steep learning curve and no ingame-tutorial whatsoever. You will have to look up quite a bit of things but the community ingame is mostly helpful as well - as long as you dont ask about very basics. And if you let it happen you will meet a lot of nice people collaborating.general:- Age of Sail | sandbox sailing simulator- a sandbox game, and will require you to make your own fun.- mostly clanbased niche-game / rather unfit for casual players - dynamic and slow paced action- player-driven economy- vast openworld-map of the Caribbean with close to 400 harbours- as close to realism as possible in battles and sailing- basic crafting system so far- various ships from 7th to 1st rate - no fancy UI so far- unfinished but work in progress descriptionspro:- Sweet Graphics and Soundeffects- plenty possibilities ingame: Trading and Crafting, Missions (PvE), Duels and battles (PvP)- rare but epic and relentless battles- various possiblities for cooperating with other playerscon:- little to none Endgame-Content- very repetitive (portbattles and missions)- long journeys with nothing to do- combat can take a long time and end in chases up to 1,5 hrs- AI sometimes has unfair advantages- shrinking Playerbase and therefore less PvP- crafting is extremely time consuming atm (It is already beeing reworked[forum.game-labs.net])☸ ☠☠☠ Community ☠☠☠ ☸Coming to NA I was never really the “clan person” but Naval Action showed me how nice it can be. Since you sometimes have a lot of time to kill sailing for a staging, missions or trading it can be fun just talking to other players. A clan is no must-have but it definitely brings more possibilities to the game. Most of the nations also have common Teamspeaks where you can meet up and organize with other players.general:- different ingame chat-channels for different matters ( nation, global, help, ...)- very active forum- most nations have set up TS for collaboratingpro:- Mostly helpful players ingame and on the forums- chat and forums are monitored and toxic players are dealt withcon:- Few active players☸ ☠☠☠ Development ☠☠☠ ☸Naval action is developed by a small team, so dont expect a high pace of developent. BUT the game is formed by the active help of the community. general:- one of the best Age of sail games with a lot of potential- work-in-progress / active development- sometimes drastic changes- sometimes one step forward, two steps back- sometimes groundbreaking new content- expect changes both good and badpro:- content is getting updated frequently- Constant contact with the playerbase- Open for criticism and suggestions- mods and devs have a open ear for problems regarding the game and its mechanicscon:- few content in the last patches- patch notes have few details - no really clear agenda atm- devs are sometimes too emotional interacting with players☸ ☠☠☠ Conclusion ☠☠☠ ☸Do you like being part of an evolving game in early access, like to try new content every month (or so), you can spare the 40 bucks and like the Age of Sail you should definitely give Naval Action a shot. But be warned you will have to sink a lot of hrs into this game to actually achieve something and expect changes both good and bad.The devs have somewhat like a plan[forum.game-labs.net] but seem to priorize different matters never the less each patch. I would advise to wait a few month before you actually buy and see how it plays out. I hope they will eventually get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together.UPDATE:As for the patch 9.96 I would still recommend the game itself but not in the current status since its insanely difficult for new players right now: - Closed Rookiearea as a huge Plus. BUT: - At the moment the market is flooded with gold which makes everything absurldy expensice for new players. - PvP is a ganking fest - mostly consists of either ganking or beeing ganked.  - The new crafting and ressources made it even more time consuming. I still really like the game, but i wouldn't recommend it to new players at the moment. Changes come and go in Early Access so this review will be updated eventually. "

								Naval action is a early access public alpha that takes place in there sailing era of between 1600-1800 in the Caribbean. The main premise of the game is to bring the age of sail to people who love naval combat.Pros: a massive MASSIVE map to explore, raid, trade or sink you way around in ships ranging from the civilian to heavily armed warships.Great amount of factions instead of just Britain, Spain, Netherlands and France. There are 8 at this time.Combat is heavily based on three things. Which is good. Speed, skill and teamwork. ( a group of small ships working in unison can literally sink a 3rd rate warship.) The Dev team have clearly done their research by reflecting the fact that the amount of guns didn't always win.A trade system which works on supply and demand much like Port Royale franchise. It is hard however as prices don't stay the same as players and wars affect both.Cons: there is no marker on the map to show your position in relation to mission markers. (I had a mission near Jamaica but I found that I was next to Bermuda)There is no way points to help with navigation which both these points can cause huge stress when trying to get to your mission. Especially when you get storms around you.There is no way to test drive ships to see if they are for you and you how they are played.Base resources are too expensive and experience gain from battles is low. It takes 20 missions to get 1000 experience points.You should be able to ring the ships bell any time with each button press to ring it. ( make use of morse code) There should be a progression table to show what you gain from promotions.It is highly function and extremely thrilling with combat and sailing physics and cannon and projectile physics too. It is worth as an early alpha £25-£35 due to its currently working and huge amount if features alongside a already vast community and friendly and dedicated Dev team.Don't ram a ship bigger than yours. You'll be shoved over with leaks in you're boat.			"

								After several hundred hours in this game I can say most of the negative reviews like so many written by the children on Steam.  Are ones written by people who dont bother to notice the game is in Early Access or more commonly called BETA.   Which is a testing phase not an actual release state for the game.  They expect this instant action 15 minutes of cannon balls and sword swinging Pirates of the Carribean style game... well they are not only wrong but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly wrong.   The fact is the game is by far the best age of sail game I have played in a VERY long time.  Is it fast paced, hell no.. is it easy to learn not really.  But it isnt the most complex game I have ever played, that honor still goes to Falcon BMS.   But it is by far one of the best looking and most well done age of sail games out there.   While it still ahs work to be done and is far from release.   But it is shaping up to be one of 2016s best games.In short, if you bought this game thinking World of Warships arena fights, you are wrong, give the game to someone who would appreciate it and just leave quitely.

								Pros: The battles are amazing. The ships are finely crafted, and the targeting and damage systems for flying cannonballs both look glorious and feel authentic.Cons: Grind, grind, grind. The game is now Open World only. Meaning you have to sail for hours across an empty ocean (boring!) to get to any battle. You have to grind for weeks to be able to sail anything larger than a frigate. Ganking is rampant, and the game is hemorrhaging players. Several months ago my server was averaging 160-200 on when I was on, now it's down to maybe 60-80 total, across all factions. The game is dying.Many fans have requested custom battles, ranked matches against other players (arena-style), or historical battle reenactment. Any/all of these would build on the game's strengths, but the developers instead are hellbent on having their game be EVE 1806 AD. There is a half-hearted attempt to have arena or matches in port, but I have never once been successfully matched with an opponent. It's broken, and they won't fix it or replace it with something better. Do not recommend.			"

								Neg:  Battles seem to be random, as you can shoot your enemy to oblivion and somehow it still manages to sail faster than you can.  Half of the battle is spend chasing your enemy instead of actually fighting.  The damage models are way off, and the chances to hit are taken straight out of a casino.The open world is a farce, battles are instanced and everybody plays the same factions.  Missions are boring as hell, seeing there's hardly any variaty.  Port battles are a joke as well because they're identical to regular battles.And to top that, it takes an horrible grind to unlock new ships that are hardly any improvement over the old one.  Cons:Graphics are okay and that's the only good thing i can mention about this game.The interface is straight out of the 90ies. (i liked the 90ies)I feel ripped off, this game should be 10 euro/dollars at best.IF you liked Total War: Empire sea battles, and look for something similar, this is not the product to buy.However if you like dreadful slow mmo's with average combat, a bad trading system and no variaty this is your game.

In depth crafting that if you like you can spend ALOT of time on.

								Really enjoyed this game until they allowed players to have AI fleets with them. I can't reccomend this game with these still in the game. It's an MMO, I want to fight players, not fight a player and then have to deal with their two AI ships afterwards.			"

								For graphics like in films you will need some strong stuff in PC . Lack of Euro PvE server hurts . Very small number of players on servers . On American PvE there was less than 100 people , a few if you know the how big map is.  Not an intuitive GUI :/ You will find a hard time to get know everything by your self. For me the biggest turn off was the look of graphics on medium settings. Not for this much money , even with discount :/			"

								An interesting game, with a lot of features of an alpha game, but you will have to look this game like a simulation one, and all the features that go with a game like that.  This game is totally not to look like an arcade one. There is a lot of navigation to do and fights does not came like for heaven, do not except for that. Gameplay is fairly slow, but for a game like that you will not have to except for a faster one, again it's a simulation more than an arcade game.Graphicaly the game is pretty good, with a really good modelisation of ships, and a really good rendering.Stay in ming that it is a pre-realise and the optimisation is not the best right now for the weakest configuration, but is really good on better ones. For myself : GTX 970 and I5 3570, 16 GO of ram : ultra configuration without any loss of fps. Tested it wit ha really low configuration : Geforce 310 M and low processor : Impossible to run, freezing in open world. So for really low and old configuration, DO NOT launch this game at the moment.KEAP IN MIND that it is a pre-release simulation game, so with not as many features as we can wait for an open world game, but enough to spend some good time if you love navy, sailing and ships. Just except to have some patience and time in game.			"

								For die hard sailing ship fans this could be the game for you.  For a very early alpha game it shows great potential, plus the devs are constantly updating and fixing bugs, damage, more acurate ships etc. All though there is no set campain missions (Yet) there still is fun in sinking other ships and trading. Upon Joining the Americans (PvE) I was greated by a warm welcome of other players who asisted me in trading and fleet missions to get me a better ship. All thoguh I'm still out classed by their massive ships we still raid the Spanish coast togehter. ProsLike i said, constant updatng don't expect for the glitch or bug you find to last long. Friendly players who are happy to join in your vendetas and help in your crafting or battles. Large amount of ships and ship classes to choose from. Even two of the same ship can have major changes. Either diferent thickness or being faster. easy grinding, most missions give 5000+ coins and different amounts of XP, depending on the mission you chose. Absolutly beautiful world down to the waves lapping against your boat. So even when your not filling a ship at port side full of holes you can still sail around and enjoy the scenery. Trading although a good mechanic still a little sketchy and chalengeing to properly do, best stick to sinking ships to start off. ConsStill in alpha so major bugs and what not everywhere. Sink mechanic kind of boring they just go straight down. You can get lucky and set the oposing ship afire but still, would be niffty seeing a ship rolling to one side or the other or even completly over and then sink. No set tutorial, just drops you in the middle of the ocean and thats that. Find your own way. Best to look up how to videos or consult your local players. Navigation is simple. Map and compass. To simple... map could use gridlines at least. Finding your missions out in the open water. No waypoint no tracker nothing. You just gauge off your map and hope you get close enough to actually see it. There is fast travel but you can't fast travel with loaded goods and when you do theres a set time limit before you can again. (usually 3 hours) To be expected for an MMO but needs work. Sailing is actual time and requires a tone of time. Even sailing the full American controled coast from top to bottom might take close to half an hour. If  the wind plays nice. Port menu kinda boring but I won't complain about that to much. It is just a menu. Still a bit pricey for an early game full of errors. But has huge potential if you dont mind waiting. Still best to wait for it to go on sale. Massive ship battles are long at least an hour. But the payout is great.Just a few of the pros and cons. But I recomend it for all pirate or privateer fans. Saill across the 7 seas,  hoist your nations colors and fight for survival amoungest players, enemy nation ships, and pirates.			"

								Graphically, it's stunning. The sense of speed is very nice and the physics seem OK. Why I am not reccommending this game is that right now, there's not a lot to do and frankly it's missing some much needed help files. Nothing is terribly intuitive and unless you pester someone on the help chat (everyone is quite helpful. It is I who feels like a pest), there's alot of experimentation that takes place which results in wasted time. I understad the game being early access means it's not going to be feature complete--and there is quite a bit going for it--but documentation should be a priority. Even just context sensitive help would be useful.			"

								When I first started playing this game I really loved it and found it enjoyable.With the past few updates this game is turning more and more into a full on sim and less of fun game mechanics.If you have time enough for a second job, like grinding and farming the same thing over and over, lack of PvP because of players, battles that last a full 1.5 hours and combat that is now sail right up next to something and slug it out until you sink. Then you probobly will love this game.I however dont have the time for this game especially because now I do not make the time to play an over simmy game. At this point it feels more like your punished to play and until they change many things toward an actual game and not a hyper realistic boring waste of time. I will not be back. As a side note the peak times used to be about 2.5k players now its down to 400ish if your lucky. This game is dying and/or dead so dont waste your money unless you liked the discription above.I could go on but I just dont want anyone to waste more money on this.-Sky			"

								Pro's:A game with extreme amount of potential. Graphics are top notch.Combat Mechanics are amazing. Absolutely amazing. Con's: Gank or be ganked is the name of the game now. Solo players and small groups will have an extrmely hard time having fun.Conclusion:I'm a PvP'er, i love relatively even fights. I don't mind fighting against the odds as long as i have a chance to win if i play really well. But, as of now, you will have to spend 5-10 Hours ingame looking for a somewhat fair fight. There is no incentive for ""fair"" fights so most people have the ""Gank or be ganked"" Attitude. Because of the above i cannot recommend the game to people like myself. If however, you like ganking, trading and crafting. Then you should definitely get this game! I had loads of fun in this game before it turned into the ""Gank or be ganked"" game it is now. I wish there was a ""Neutral"" option when it comes to recommending the game...			"

Early Access Review
								Right off the bat I want to just say: this is great game and I've never spent so many hours with any one steam purchase.  It's early access so there are of course some problems and the Devs can be a bit tetchy at times but it's nothing like has been made out in recent Steam reviews and obviously Early Access means things are changing all the time.  The UI and clan mechanics are a tad basic atm but that's prety minor stuff, escpecially when you consider extremely polished battle system and the quality of the ship models.So the game tries to simulate/gamify being a sea captain in the late 18th/early 19th Century and it does a pretty good job of this.  Obviously it's not a true simulation, the scurvy and weevilvs have been swapped out for live map coordinates and a teleport function if you get really lost, but that's probably for the best.  There are two modes, the Open World which is a large map of the Caribbean where you sail from port to port and the battles.  The battles are phenomenal: beautiful to watch and exciting to play with a realistic flavour absent in SO SO SO many other pirate/sailing games.The game offers various playstyles but I mainly play RvR (Realm vs Realm) where you sail for one of the 7 in-game nations (+ Pirates) and attempt to conquer ports off eachother.  Not all factions work the same way but most have clans that work together to conquer or blockade ports, diplomats that work out deals between the factions and some people who pass it all by and just go sailing the open seas looking for enemies to sink, ignoring RvR completely.  There also are competitions, both dev and player run for people looking for a quick consequence-free ship battle.  Some of the best parts of the game aren't even dev made and that's communities and the culture built up around the game.  There is some toxicity of course, and that's a shame, but it represents a small part of the game experience compared to the vast majority who are courtious and polite and for the most part passionate about history, sailing and just having a good time.  For example: at the moment there's a guy putting out weekly Youtube videos following the battles and conquests on the game with specials on tactics and ships and other assorted game topics.https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQBM7edgbrg0liG9V5sy-1AThee's another guy making a 3D model of a British 2rd rate from 1768 who posts regular updates on his progresshttp://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/19328-hms-barfleur-1768-3d-model/and like them there are lots of people doing really cool and interesting things that make the culture around the game a fantastic added benifit.As I said before it's an Early Access game so there are some kinks to be ironed out and that is what's causing the most amountof angst both in the forums and in the Steam Reviews.  It's a game that lots of people are passoionate about so when things head in a certain direction they don't like people get salty.  There's also been a few atempts at using bad steam reviews as a way try and influence the Devs against certain decisions.    I'm not saying that's the reason for all the negative reviews but it's a factor in a few of the most recent ones. The devs can get a bit defensive but personally I wouldn't say they've crossed a line or been rude to people who hadn't first been rude to them. People get salty because they care about the game and they care because it really is a great game.  It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea but if you're on the fence about this one I'd say give it a go. "

								Naval Action: Where you spend most of the time alone, alt-tabbed trying to find the next album to listen to while you get bored. Oh, and PvP where it is ganking simulator. Can't even have fun on my own, most of the time, the small server population of a measly 180 people just go sailing around for the next person to gank. In my encounters thus far, I've been ganked by 3 players and 8 ships total - against my one ship. I'd call that a problem with the PvP mechanic. It could be a symptom of the age of sail and how battles occured then, but it would be nice if that mechanic was editted vastly as it only drives players away - including myself. I'd consider PvE but it lacks content compared to PvP. Casual PvP sounds fun - being ganked by 3 bored players and 8 ships; that's not fun.			"

Early Access Review
								Pretty much everything you read about this game is true, both good and bad, but it most certainly does not deserve all the negative reviews that dominate the top of board, at least one of them written by someone who still plays the game. Go figure.This game is in early access. It is not finished and some things you might take for granted - such as a tutorial - simply don't exist. The players (some of them) are helpful enough but it takes ages to talk through - or write in chat - all the game mechanics you will encounter in your first few minutes playing. If you are thinking of buying this game, do read forums, game guides, check out youtube and so on to find at least the basics of how to play so you don't entirely swamp Help chat with questions when you start.The devs and chat and forum moderators are ... erratic. Sometimes it seems like Geppetto has carved this beautiful game, but he grew old, tired, blind or something and left it to his wayward apprentices to finish. There must have been some great vision to have got this far, but until recently it seemed to have been lost with a history of abandoned trials (which players predicted would fail, and they did) finishing up with three grand announcements about a server wipe, allocating crafting resources to the 25 Port Battle winning participants, and merging the PvE and PvP servers. The server wipe was widely accepted as a good idea and is planned for 20th April 2017, and I think it is to the dev's great credit that the other two ideas have been withdrawn. The PvE server will now stay for at least 18 months after release, followed by a review (and quite honestly I will be surprised if release is in 2017 - I think there's quite a lot of life left in PvE, but your guess is as good as mine).On technical points the devs actually seem very good at listening (despite what you might read), but they are sometimes poor at communicating and they appear to have a total blind spot when it comes to humour, particularly it seems from American players (I think they don't pick up very well on American cultural references). If you post anything funny that could possibly be misconstrued as an accusation (against them or a fellow player - it doesn't matter) you can expect a week's forum ban. They are very heavy handed.The playerbase is also sometime overly aggressive, misogynistic and unsympathetic to people who like to play in a different manner from them. But this is an MMO so it goes with the territory, I'm afraid. However this is almost certainly the best age of sail game you have ever played so if the only thing putting you off is that it is an MMO with all that entails, perhaps the PvE server might be for you. People are polite there; there is no aggression - literally at the moment: no other player can ever attack you and right now AI ships won't attack you either (but you can attack them). This will probably change so there is some form of AI aggression (this is an early access game so things change - I really cannot repeat this enough), but either way it opens the possibility for playing the game like a sailing sim, roleplaying or whatever takes your fancy, things you cannot usually do in a combat-orientated MMO.Personally, crafting is my thing so I play on a PvP server, where there is real demand as well as risk. The crafting system isn't yet sorted so - as with so many other bits of the game - don't come here with too high expectations, but the 20th April server wipe will bring changes which look good from here. I look forward to finding out.Finally, if you are reading this before 20th April, don't think you need to put off buying the game till after then. Start before and you'll keep your combat and crafting xp and be given 4 free ships after the wipe. Come on in, the water's lovely.			"

								Warning read before you buy this game. Naval Action Game Developers FULLY SUPPORT Game Exploiters and cheaters. Below link is total proof http://imgur.com/a/zafrcThey allow atleast 1 clan to Dupe Ships and Top end mods for months as they knew about it. The developers never closed the loopholes and never informed the community. These cheaters played for months and didnt need to spend hours or 90% + game play to build / gather resources and transport them. Yet everyone else had too.  Developers never Banned a single offender for CHEATING AND ABUSING GAME MECHANICS.  This is NEWS ""BUT THEY WILL BAN YOU FOR SPEAKING UP IN THE GAME FORUMS not only on the Forums but the GAME ITSELF!DOnt agree with them they will Mute you everyway possible. THEY are even getting Ride of GLOBAL CHAT to keep everyone silenced.""Once players became aware it started dupe gate! Once Dupe gate started the Game Developers decided to totally change the core aspects of the game to cover up dupe gate. This game now 4 years into development yet they are still changing the fundamental game mechanics. They are trying to push this game out of development as broken as it is so they can start a New game. The Developers have posted since Steam release 3 times this game should have been released.  January 2017 was the last launch date for game release we are already 4 months behind and they have nothing tested.  These Devs are amature at best in developing MMO game play style. Todate they have sold over 95000 copies of this game and less then 1% play this game activly daily nevertheless 60% or more are alternate accounts. I know players with 5 accounts or more! "

								This game blows elephant dong the alpha stage players have hoarded all the resources and make purchasing new ships an art of pure jewery then to add insult to injury after the devs make you drop the million gold you spend two weeks grinding for a crappy frigate which after sinking 5 times is lost forever along with all the gold u spent on it all so the jew alpaha stage players can continue to enrich themselves. This game could be great but sucks because the alpha players and the devs are nothing but shylocks.			"

								Best historical age of sail depiction with computers to date.Better than the race boat like experience of other games with sailing ships.Can get lonely on long journeys. Developers and community are still looking for the right framework for  meaningful fights, Developers are working hard. Players seem to exhaust themselves with thousends of hrs to the extent, that they give bad reviews, when they dont get their ways with their collected pixels.The sights and sounds of combat will motivate for a long time.

								Avoid this development team in the game's current condition. You'll regret buying it.I bought this game because of my love for ships and while this does indeed quench that desire ... I've noticed very little has changed in the time i've played, watched videos and read the VERY vaguely explained patch notes themselves... Ocasional FPS buffers, sometimes a ping spike 'patch' that helps stabilize long-winded trips out into the deeper confines of the ocean tides... But nothing very stable that can be considered extensively ""important"" (major ship additions, revamped shop UI's and such, better ship ramming (still can flip a ship just by rubbing it long enough) and still could use some major reworking when it comes to physics effecting ship shrapnel... stronger FRIENDLY communication with the players and so forth is still nowhere to be found. Most admins on the forums themselves defend the game's ""positive"" aspects. But degrade ANYONE that negatively shames their game and development team. They silence those that post their concerns. This wouldn't be too severe if it wasn't for the fact they don't simply silence those that make stupid retorts like ""this game sucks"" or ""fix the game"" ... they silence those that actually give suggestions, tell them where they're doing things wrong, and take their frustrations out on the players themselves as if they are the reason they are failing. Having played over 40 Alpha games, purchasing my way into many of them to help the developers where i believed they could make a beautiful game, and earning my way into a few as well like Crossout and World of Warships (albeit those will be coming out as F2P's later on. WoWS being in open Beta/""launch stages"" in retrospect) I can not stress this enough about testers' relationship with their respective development team..Developers who refuse to accept they need to work on something specific, or blame the community for their incompetance, WILL NOT MAKE IT PAST THEIR FIRST YEAR OF FULL RELEASE WITH POSITIVE MARKS nor make headway in marketing and eventually collapse within a 2 year timeframe.You can not blame the customers for a developer issue. You can not blame slow development on a small player base due to your lack of new content to test and lack of communication with your players/ability to advertise effectively to the right playerbase.And you sure as hell can not blame your players for being mad at admins that refuse to man up and accept they're out of line with their constant slandering of the playerbase when the playerbase PURCHASED a game that refuses to show progress going towards their release date.A perfect example of this is Ant's review.  found here Until this game can show some true expansion into becoming an even greater game, and hold to their promises... this game will not be able to be taken seriously. Especially if they must rely upon the bribery of the players' vote to make progress when it should be their own diligence and desire to see a gem of a program shine beyond that which are considered their competitor development teams...You've been ""released"" here on steam less than 11 months, and are still bare-bones. I don't expect a lot from a young game like this. But the things i, as a paying tester and requested support ""pillar"" in the progression of this game's future, do expect (as do many other players here)... are 4 things in particular.1) a strong, focused development team looking forward with a clear vision for the game in development. 2) An administration/moderation team that is here to help the playerbase no matter the issue, and to help quell concerns in a professional way.3) consistent, DETAILED patch notes to help us see exactly how the game is progressing or where problems may come about.4) New content.. either supported by the playerbase or made with the intent of progressing the game's development and expand upon the game's replay-capability and stretching out to new players... Right now NONE of that is being shown nor thought about. Matter of fact the opposite is being shown. And until these 4 core problems are looked at and rectified, there will never be much more than a ""small niche"" of players that have stayed loyal since the beginning. (at the moment that ""niche"" is about 1300 players across multiple servers.) And of course, the population of players that refuse to watch the game to be treated so disrespectfully while game admins are spitting at the community...I'm sorry. But you're sinking faster than the RMS Lusitania at this rate... and it's being done by your own hands.			"

								I tried to keep an open mind since this game is still in alpha. With that said for about the last 8 months the developers have been making any activity in the game ridiculously hard......Ship building, trading, finding resources, getting from one location to the next takes way to damn long. The player base has gone down significantly, and is on a decline. Unless the the game changes developers I would not recommend this game to anyone.			"

								I love parts of this game but just cannot reccomend it as it stands. The devs have a fantastic setup for the future of this game and will surely make a game that will go down in history. But as of right now, there is just too many flaws that make me rage quit this game every time I try and get into it. I'll list some of my complaints below. Keep in mind that I have been playing this game quite a bit to try and see if maybe I am doing something wrong, but I am convinced that this game has too many issues for me personally.1. There is no tutorial at all. This game has a very very steep learning curve, almost like hopping into IL-2 1946 on max realism for your first time. You are dropped into the game and are on your own immediately. They don't even tell you how to open your sails to move. You are forced to get in touch with a clan who can train you and provide you with some basic knowledge about how to even use the port menus. Joining a clan isn't too bad of an idea since almost all of the larger clans are happy to help but if you like to be a lone wolf it can be very frustrating.2. The AI is extremely overpowered if you try to battle by yourself. This is perhaps my biggest pet peeve about this game. If you are by yourself trying to do a mission on your level it is nearly impossible to sink the AI. I did a battle in which I was in a Navy Brig, the AI was in a regular Brig. I had 37 leaks on his ship and he was at near zero armor. He was still floating like nothing happened. He could even sail into the wind at 8 - 10 knots while the second I turned into the wind, I came to a dead stop. I was at around quarter armor all around and had 0 leaks and I was taking on water at crazy rates after one broadside. I have never been able to take on an AI in battle unless I had a fleet with me or took on a low level mission while using a large ship. The AI seems to be way too accurate, way too maneuverable, and have armor that seems like it's made out of cast iron.3. The optimization is absolutely terrible. Not much really to be said on this subject. The game has pretty bad optimization.4. The game is extremely grindy for XPIf you want to level up within a day you have to get used to doing back to back missions. It's not bad at first but once you reach level 4 or 5, it takes forever to level up. If you want to get this to play for only a couple hours a day, you might want to get used to the cutter because it will take you weeks to level up. While this can be a con, it is also understandable since you don't want everyone rolling around in the best ship.I have many more complaints, but I am really not trying to go on a b*tch fest here. I'm just trying to say what I don't like about this game. I will probably continue to try and like this game but as I said before, unless you are constantly with a couple of people to help you in battle, it is near impossible to win fights unless you go against a small ship. For $40 I would personally say wait until this goes on sale for at the most $25 and pick it up then if you really want it.			"

								My first game review, though I own many games on steam.The reason for this is Naval warfare in the age of sail is close to my heart.Firstly, like many others have said, the graphics are very pretty, which nice on its own, does also lend a sense of immersion.So I hope graphically it continues to to be the way it is so far.There is a few choices of nations, to start, which cant be a bad thing, some reportedly are underplayed, but there is time im sure to balance that out, though some will always be the underdogs in a way, as they might of been historcially, due to various influences.I have seen people knock the game so far for not having a tutorial, well, there are many video's on youtube and also in my opinion, there isn't a lot of complex mechanics going on in the game at present. As for the complexity and realism of sailing an age of sail warship and gunnery, there is information all over the internet. The game doesn't hold your hand in many respects and I personally like that, for instance, you dont see where you are on the sea, you have to work it out yourself. But I hope they can introduce somehow realistic mechanics, maybe a sextant, the sun, stars, or similar to add to realism, for navigation.The game map covers the caribbean, whilst large it's not something you can get lost in for days, but I have heard it takes  several hours real time to sail it's width, wind dependant I assume.The interface currently is really basic, hopefully that will improve and be polished.You can dock in ports, which is represented in port by an interface, no avatar combat or walking around port. You can buy and sell in other ports and I think there is organised warfare between nations on some scale.Naval Action, has the beginning of possibly a great niche game, one that I think many people may want to play, it looks beatiful, the sailing and gunnery seem realistic. It remains to be seen how the game develops in a broader sense, with trading, crafting, warfare and the meta game, but the nuts and bolts of the game seem well established. "

								I grew up reading C.S. Foresters Hornblower novels and it sparked in me my love and interest for the Age of Sail.Sadly this period was grossly underrepresented in todays entertainment industry until recently.This game feels like a simulator version of Sid Meier´s Pirates and it will grip everyone looking for the freedom and adventure of  the high sees of the 17th Century. Having said that one has to mention that Naval Action feels very much like a game in alpha. The UI is terrible and many gameplay elements arent implemented yet but if you are a hardcore fan like me this game will entertain you none the less. "

								This game is AWESOME! Open world sandbox, PvP and PvE, port battles, and just the joy of sailing are a few things you will find in Naval Action. Aside from that this is a most enjoyable game.  You can capture a new ship for an upgrade while doing missions or steal one from another player ;) Trade is profitable and the ship crafting system is also in place for all you people who love to make stuff in MMO's for either your Clan/Guild or for profit on the market. Different ports produce different things and buy the stuff that it doesn't; each port has it's own prices for different goods. The graphics in this game are stunning at full settings; from the ship models to the world itself and ambiance. The sounds have a ways to go but meh, it's quite easy to look past with the rest of the beauty this game has to offer. If you are a fan of the age of sail I HIGHLY recommend this game :DUpdate:A year later... this game is still awesome :)			"

								Early Access review. Don't treat this game as finished. You should assume the professionalism of the team behind the game and trust they will fix major issues.--First and foremost, I want to think that this is one of those games where if you don't like the context or subject matter at least a bit, you're going to hate it. If you do love it, you will probably find it effortless to learn the game, as I did. I didn't need a tutorial, I didn't need to ask questions, all the information you need is on the screen and if you've spent any time playing games and know the most basic requirements for floating a boat on water, you will figure it out. I recommend a peek at the game's key bindings for a hint as that is what I do in any new game I pick up. I see most of the negative reviews on this game are a result of new players not knowing what to do or supposedly not having questions answered.This doesn't make the game bad. In my experience, this is one of the most polished vehicle combat experiences I've ever handled. In the CURRENT state of the game, however? You will not have a lot of fun if you do not like shooting boats with your boat as of writing this review, trade is entirely unfinished as are non-combat missions.Another point of contention is the UI. We all know it's not the prettiest. But it works. And this is early access. Devs require support, so they offer the game before it's done in trust that you will understand this is not full release and tell them what needs fixing. UI is something on their list. They know. It even says ""test UI"" in-game. Another thing! This is not an instant-gratification game. There IS a grind. And if you don't want to slag away at your XP (as it stands in the current state of the game) in order to get bigger boats, more crew, either don't purchase, or wait and see how the game develops.This is all my subjective perspective and doesn't at all speak for other experiences. But I hope this may at least help you decide if this is or isn't a game for you.			"

What about cloth , guns, and other things  from the industialized north and Europe. This Game could not only be fun for a wide range of age groups but EDUCATIONAL as well.

								This game is actually pretty damn awesome, even with it being nothing like I expected it to be (I was expecting vast open world battles that greatly focused on realism).  While the game is more realistic than the others that are currently on the market, there are still some things that throw it off.  Battles are initiated, which are followed by a loading screen.  Anyone in the area joins the battle when its initiated, and others are able to join while its in session by going to that location and joining.  The game is pretty slow, yet feels very fast paced.  Most battles tend to last about 30+ minutes, but every second of those 30 minutes is a great experiance.Probably one of those games that over the next couple months I'll put a couple hundred hours into; and will more than likely return to afterwards.

								It was a lot of hype,  this game was.   And frankly,  it's ok.  Is it the best game evar?  No.Is it playable?  YESI would be harsher,  but this feels very much like an early access game.  A game with an unpoished menu, but a solid core mechanics.    In time,  after tightening a few bolts and giving it a fresh coat of paint,   yeh, this will be a solid rival to Uncharterd Waters, and the like,   for now, it's a fun boat game.			"

								I have to say this is probably the best naval game out there to date, for being an early access game it already feels like a very playable game. just one thing, make sure you team up and work together with your nation as you will find taking on tougher missions comes with a lot more damage dealt to you. I do feel the AI is very stupid sometimes turning into you or even firing a full broadside into your hull but im sure this will be addressed.I shall see you at sea Captains.			"

								For those interested in a deep, methodical, and strategic Naval Combat & Trading game, this is the cream of the crop. Even while in early access, I have found immense pleasure in sailing the Caribbean, using only a compass and landmarks to navigate, and engaging enemy vessels with a number of beautiful ships. The combat is comprehensive, utilizing demasting, chain shots against sails, wind, and positional damage--shoot below the waterline to start sinking a vessel, or use grapeshot on their weather deck to kill crew before boarding! This game is certainly not for everyone; it is NOT an arcade game, and if you do not have the patience to truly explore and learn the skills needed, you may not find that you enjoy this game. But, for those of you with a hardy constitution and a love of the sea, you'll find no better game to capture the sense and feel of Napoleonic Naval Warfare.			"

Even in it's unpolished state, Naval Action is a thing of beauty. I would HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who loves the genre. Simply put..if you love the age of sail games, this will be the crown jewel of your collection. Also, dont be intimidated by the UI and lack of tutorial. If you have played any tall ship games before, most of it will be very intuitive for you. Plus, its EA (early access) so things will only get better (if that were possible)  :) "

								Sitting at the dock of the bay, minding my own business when all of a sudden on the faction chat there is a call to arms.10 pirates are harassing some of our controlled waters and they did already for a couple of days.  So a lesson needed to be taught.Within 10 minutes the bay flocked with faction members and all jumped on Teamspeak.I was sailing my yacht, the smallest ship in game.The pirates were sailing Frigates.Anyway, I'm a speedy Gonzales compared to these monsters, so I just need to stay at their stern or bow to avoid their deadly volleys. So we were spread out in the bay, sails down and playing the waiting game and set the ambush..When suddenly they got spotted, I raced my yacht to them and started to call an attack.Battle started and BAM, 25 players all sorts of ships VS 10 Pirates.One or two fled, the others got sunk. While our nation was still teamed up we've raced to the pirates respawn harbour and took them for another fight, reducing their available ships in our nations waters.This is what makes this game great.

								So it's time to change my review since I'm now 800+ hours into this game.I have pretty much experienced all the game has to offer, and I have to say Naval Action is my game. It's my Star Wars Galaxies, my Eve Online, and every other game I've played over the years that has sucked me in to become an obsession.Let me be blunt. Naval Action falls into the marmite category in that you will either love it or hate it depending on what you look for in a PC MMO.  It is NOT a game for people who want instant fast paced action. It's not a game for kids, and it's not a game for those who don't have even a slight interest in 18th century naval warfare.It IS a game for the more mature gamer who enjoys a PVP game that has moments of inactivity (sailing) with burst of exciting naval combat with opposing players. The ships are beautiful and combat is very realistic.  I've read all the recent negative reviews about this game having no end game content. Frankly I find this absurd. The end game 'content' quite simply is PVP. These guys have rushed to get in the biggest ships then wonder why people run from their 1st rate fleet. Their ego limits their ability to get out of their first rates and into something more PVP focused. In addition, they forgotten that this is an ALPHA game with much of the content still in development.The other comments I read are about chat bans. As a 41 year old gamer, I've seen it all. Many MMO's have such a toxic community, it can be enough to put you off playing the game. NA on the other hand have a low tolerance attitude towards toxic idiots who have gotten it into their heads that due to the anonymity of the internet, can say and do what they like without fear of consequence. In naval action, such idiots are quickly dealt with leaving the rest of us rational and respectful players to get on with the game without having to deal with the drama queens.  Seriously folks, if you've been turned off a game because of its community, you'll find the NA community to be one of the most helpful and friendliest out there.So as a potential purchaser of Naval action, let me tell you about what you can expect.Once you get through the early stages of the game and get into a ship that has a role in combat, you will want to join a clan. NA is a social game and really it's all about the clan. Do your research, find a good one and I can promise you, you'll have a great time.  Once you are sailing with your clan, your world of possibilities opens up, and you'll spend a lot of your time going out and either defending your own waters against enemy players who try to harass your countrymen, or you'll go to their waters and try to harass theirs.  PVP is usually never hard to find.For the PVE'ers, there is content for you here too, but I can imagine without PVP, it will become repetitive fast. PVP is were it's at!Like EVE online, NA has it's interesting politics. You'll no doubt find a nemesis, that guy you are determined to catch and sink.  There's lots of personalities out there, and you could be one too. Being 'famous' is all part of the attraction of NA, just like the real sea captains of the time.  For me, it's these clashes of personalities ad egos that makes this game so much fun.At £29.99, in terms of fun per investment, I can tell you with my 800+ hours in this game, It's given me approximately 790 more hours of fun than AAA The Division at almost double the price.

								A rare type of MMO - one designed for players that enjoy tougher MMOs. No icon on the map to display your position, localized banking, PVP almost anywhere (on the PVP servers), etc. This is a very solid foundation and could potentially turn into one of the best MMOs out there. In my opinon, your enjoyment of the game will come down to how much you enjoy the combat system. If you like how it looks, buy the game immediately.			"

								Have had the game during early days when it was available only as a paypal bought option at the Sea Trials stage. I did mess around with the open world starting points when those came out. But, was a bit more difficult at the time due to mass packs of enemy AI running around. Currently, I'd say the devs have some work ahead of them. Nothing insurmountable or even that difficult that I would say they have to do. I have yet to really see anything that could be a bug or even be considered game breaking. Damage modeling is exceptional, and doing targeted shots can be very useful.. Not a run and gun shooter or action game. Combat involves ensuring position prior to going into a fight, and using strategy, tactics, proper formation use, and pure skill at manuevering a ship. If you want something that is a slight challenge, with sandbox attributes, and a good solid community then this is one of those games. I would rank the community as being close to if not on par with the great community EvE has built over it's many years.			"

								Loving the game so far!  My laptop struggles a bit (plus a slow internet connection), but I look forward to trying it on my desktop with better internet.  Exploring the Open World is great, combat is fun, and the other players are friendly and helpful.  There is some uncertainty about etiquette for entering battles vs the AI that other players are already engaged in.  Some people welcome the help and others feel like you're stealing their xp.  Hopefully some sort of optional lock-out system will be implemented (or already exists and I just don't know about it).  All-in-all a great game, worth the $40 even in Early Release.			"

								Well, yes, it is yet another unfinished (for now) early access game. Many things are missing (dear lord, at least add scale ratio to the map!), game explains absolutely nothing (it couldn't be more unhelpfull to new players even if they tried) and UI is a times really awfull. Oh, and for early access game it is pretty expensive.But even so, it is a lot of fun. There aren't many games in this genre and for many players the naval combat from the age of sails just strikes a soft spot. After some 20+ hours of playing (and googling a lot or watching YT videos, because the game really explains nothing) I really like what I got, even in the current unfinished state.			"

								Create a character, pick a nation to work with (or ye Pirates), then start learning the art of naval combat.  Once you learn a little you will gain XP and gold to be used to purchase larger ships.  Bigger ships brings more intense battles as well as higher XP and gold rewards.Or if you prefer to be a merchant you can travel the Caribbean searching for the best markets to purchase base materials like logs and metal ore.  Then transport it back to your base of operations and craft ships and materials that you can sell for a profit.  If you get good at it there is a huge markup on high-end ships.For an ""Early Access"" game it feels fairly polished.  The only exception is the port/crafting/shopping interface which is expected to get a makeover. "

								This is a great game, and can only get better from here. The combat is very well done, and detailed. The open world if VAST and interesting if a bit sparse at the moment. The pvp fights for conquests are interesting and the game does little in the way of holding your hand.The game is best played with a group of people out hunting down missions or other players, as well as working together to bettter the nation you play on. You can join a PVE server if pvp is not your thing, but you also don't entirely need to participate in pvp if you don't wish to on the pvp server itself either if you stay away from the front lines.All in all, I feel like the game needs a little more time in the development cooker but as far as early access is concerned this is a game that has already sucked out over 174 hours of my time as of writing this. If you would like to see what combat is like in the game please check out my youtube channel at Drakedge2000			"

								It is basically Sid Meier's Pirates! brought into 2016. It looks like it will be fun and promising. Trade, ship battles and maybe eventually missions. For now the gameplay is a bit slow and I hope they speed it up some. (Engagments are VERY lengthy). I spent over an hour duking it out with two NPC ships when I attacked their convoy. It ended in a stalemate...			"

								For a 'pre-release Alpha' stage game it already has plenty of great content to justify 40+ hours of play.But the current rough UI and less than stellar economic system is NOT the end vision, please check out the forums at http://forum.game-labs.net/ for some nibbles of the long term goals of player-driven economy and large scale conquest.You will see alot of comparisons of this game to Eve online, these are not entirely unjustified as there are similarities of goal.  However this game is NOT EVE: Age of Sail, there are some sharp differences on all levels but the MOST IMPORTANT: Aiming matters.  This game is less excel 2.0 simulator and more sailing+broadside management.			"

								One of my first reviews because this game deserves itFirstly the developers have obviously put a lot of thought in to this game and continue to add fixes and patches, really great work on their part. I was scepticle with this game at first I've tried games alike to this in the past and although they were good there was nothing that made them gripping, this game seriously has it all.The graphics are actually amazing for this game, they also keep adding little tweaks which make them more intense as the patches come out. The clans are great use and you are part of nations opposing every other nation, get in the right clan and its 24/7 game play.You can play this game in several ways depending on what you want to achieve. You can play as a trader and make your money, you can also combine that and be a crafter making ships for others to buy from you. The crafting aspect is actually very good, one being that you don't just get automatic rights to craft anything you like, it creates more thinking and a tech tree to follow, one part makes this part and you only get a certain amount of labour you can use per hour which means people can't gain silly amounts of advantage. Also you have to craft certain types of ships with just a small % of a chance you'll get the blue prints to other ships meaning it takes time and tactic to be able to craft different ships.Now if you go for the battle side this is a very broad game play. We have port battles, PvP or just plain old hunt the AI. I must admit alot of thought has gone into this; you need to be able to think, control and watch. The devs keep patching this area and adding or smoothing out the tweaks and doing an amazing job for it. When sailing in battle you have to think which direction you are going, where your sails are pointing how much sail you have, how many people on guns, how many people on plugging leaks. It really is in depth as a game gets for this area you quite literally can control everything. Overall I would extremely recommend this game and urge anyone thinking to get this. The price tag is worth it!!! Constant patches and planned improvements that are set this game to be one you won't get bored on. I've clocked so many hours and the worst part is I never saw those hours go by, its truly addictive when you join the right clan community; my main tip is to join a clan to maximise every aspect of this game.

								An open-world combat and trading experience, Naval Action is a pretty damn good sailing game. It is heavily in alpha, however: UI elements are plainly unfinished, there are very few tooltips to help anyone get started, and even statistics are poorly formatted and explained.With all that being said, what exactly are you getting?You're getting an open world experience whereby you sail around, encounter enemy players (read: not a member of your nation) and then challenge them to battle. You and them begin an instanced ship-on-ship battle whereby you can either stand and fight or run by avoiding fire for a minute or so.Ship customization isn't here yet, though equipment and crafting is. It is possible, but difficult, to craft an entire ship from scratch by buying the components for it. Obtaining these resources other than buying them, however, is apparently not possible.The game prides itself more towards realism than arcade simulation: physics make targeting enemies on the open sea difficult, as both your ship and the enemy ship bob and crest with waves. There is a map, but it does not tell you where you are. You have to navigate the world the old-fashioned way: using your compass.It does support PvP and PvE servers, and in PvE you can only fight NPC ships. In PvP you can be challenged by just about anyone, and trading becomes far more challenging. Hiring fleet vessels to protect you in a PvP scenario is a must.Overall, it's highly unpolished but well worth $55 CAD. If you like this concept, but are intimidated by its skill ceiling, take a look at the Steam game Windward instead.			"

								This game is really one of the games that I've enjoyed the most over the past few years. I love how the sailing age has finaly got a game that takes it seriously. The ship models are second to none, and I love how the game is under constant development. The majority of the people complaining about this game, complain about the lack of player influence over the game. To you people: let the people who actually know what they are doing, do the development. I recommend this game. Be ready for alot of grinding, but when you get there, when you reach your goal, you'll feel like you actually acomplished something.			"

								If you love the age of sail or a slowwer paced game this is great. A few things bug me about this game mainly being that 1st rates are what win wars, if your nation can't bring 25 1st rates to a port battle you may as well not go, I know the devs are working on a fix for this problem though. The grind isn't as bad as it used to be and the AI have been fixed aswell. The devs have said they will support and add content to this game as long as there are players playing it which I hope will be for a long time. All in all I give Naval action a 8 out of 10 and that will go up as more things are added to the game.			"

								I think I found my Game!First when I saw the price I wasn't sure I want to buy this Game, but now I know it was worth it. It has a great Community (Ingame).You can join different Factions like Great Britain, Spain, France, Dutch, Pirate and much more. There is a big open world map with many many Places. You can trade, plunder, boarding, fight each other, craft, lvling up and so on.The Sailing is not easy you have to learn it and that is one thing that I like on this Game. You need to set the Sails in the right direction to the Wind to go forward, otherwise you will not move.You can have many Outposts where you can storage your cargo and Vessels. But when another Fraction take over the Town where you have one of you Outposts your things on this Outpost will be lost. Even Your Ship (it doesn't matter how expensive it was) has a durability of 5. So your ship can sink 5 times until it's lost you need to get a new one or sail with the free basic cutter that you can buy in any Town.When you sail with your vessel on the Map it feels like that you are not alone on this map, it's full of life.I like this Game very much!I hope this Game will never be F2P because that will destroy the Community with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.

								Having aspirations to become a naval officer and chagrined I will likely never have the chance to captain a warship under independent command (given my country's pitifully small navy), I took great interest in Naval Action. While rather pricey for a game still in an open alpha, the game itself is quite fun – with new content being added regularly.While still a game in active development with quite a few flaws and the sometimes painfully repetitious grinding for higher ranks/manpower/resources to make components to construct ships, the freedom afforded in the game is outstanding. Learning optimal angles to sail in the wind, manoeuvring to ripple off broadside after broadside at foes with great plumes of gunsmoke obscuring your vessel, your battleline - and ominously, that of the enemy. The ability to board an enemy vessel to take a grand prize for yourself and the crew. This game exudes the spirit of the Napoleonic era.More than that, nothing quite beats the exhilaration of participating in a PVP fleet action in a wee 7th rate cutter against 4th and 5th rate enemy ships.  The stark terror of the sea about your small ship awash from a 25-gun broadside of 18 pound shot, with a mere six-gun broadside of 6-pounder shot to reply with.			"

								This is a PVE viewpoint only. I do not like, enjoy, or participate in PVP.Since they have changed their decision to close down the PVE server, i will give this a recommend, (with reservations) for now.Still a nice looking and fun game, and they say they are working on adding more PVE missions and play.  Which is sorely needed. They still need to learn that you can not use the same rules for both PVP and PVE servers. They are totaly different play styles and types, and you just can not cram them both into the same rule sets without creating issues for one or the other at times.So, with the above caveats, I will say yes on the recommendation for now, and hope they continue to add to the PVE gameplay.  This is still one of the best PVE sailing ship games around right now, and has a ton of potential to be much better, or ruined completely. Praying hard for the ""much better"" option here:)			"

								In some ways acting as a successor to Pirates of the Burning sea, Naval action is a far more realistic voyage into naval combat. The game has a large focus on trade, and the major nations must struggle for control over all of the major trading ports in their attempt to acheive naval superiority. Large scale naval battles are acheived in a grand fashion, with beautifully rendered oceans, and ships. Smoke billows off of freshly fired cannons, and drifts away slowly with the breeze. Battles in Naval action require a bit of practice, and an understanding of basic seamanship will help asspiring captains greatly. The action here is slower than many games, and requires a bit of tactical positioning; it is critical that players learn to use the wind to their advantage if wishing to avoid destruction.Naval action is still in early access and has a number of issues at the moment.While the game is lovely, this graphical fidelity comes at a performance cost; further optimizations will hopefully reduce the strain on mid-range systems such as my own, but with my rig the game is perfectly playable. The UI leaves much to be desired as well, as the developers have opted to use a placeholder GUI while they work on core mechanics. This issue should easily be resolved in the coming months.CPU:i5-3750k 2.6ghz - OC 4.0ghzNvidia Geforce 660ti 16gb ddr3 ramWhile It might not be for everyone, I personally rate Naval Action at ~ 9/10.Technical issues keep me from giving it a perfect score, but I fully expect those to be resolved at a steady pace.

Early Access Review
								Naval Action presents one of the most unique and revolutionary attempts at melding an MMORPG with a ""World of Warships"" style gameplay. As someone with 600+ hours and on a hiatus since this game's Early Access Steam launch, I can truly say that this is one of the more ambitious games on the market which will unfortunately be both its strength and weakness. It goes without saying that Naval Action will be in early access for the indefinite future, with many massive features such as whether there will be an ""over world"" section of the game or not still on the chopping block. This and many other important ""MMORPG"" aspects such as trading, PvP, PvE, in my eyes are still yet to be finalized by the developers' vision, which I confirmed after observing discussions of this game's future with developers on their Naval Action forums. It is important to list this project's current faults to anyone considering purchase in the forseeable future (months or so from writing this review at the least):-Player population is dismal. Will spike when major content releases like most MMORPGs experience player traffic, however Naval Action is considerably more niche in the genre and sees maybe 1000~ players on generous days. When Naval Action releases on Steam fully, it must truly be impressive to maintain a truly enjoyable playerbase for a game of this scope.-Most population/interest is focused in the European zone. If you want a truly ""massive"" experience, you will learn to accept European latency. -Development is slow and often times due not just to a small dev team, but rather their circular decisions on some core aspects of the game. For instance, in the short few weeks I was active the dev team consistently patched varying versions of the ""PvP tag circle"" mechanic which would initiate battles. While a rather divisive issue in the community, the developers' responses/patches were usually delayed and they ultimately went back and forth on their decision to this mechanic multiple times. I wonder how much developer time was wasted on this indecisiveness, when they could have been improving other aspects of this game so desperately lacking? (PvE, Exploring, Tracking, Economy, Quests, UI, etc.) -Bare bones. The combat simulator portion of this game is enjoyable, but so far Naval Action fails to sell the idea that you are a Naval Captain in a truly massive conflict where players pull the strings. Expect dull trade runs, ""fishing"" by pressing a button, zero quests, and very boring PvE battles to farm up ranks to use better ships. Casual players beware.Now let's discuss the positive aspects of Naval Action:-If you're a fan of historical naval tactics, engagements, naval vessels, etc. from about 1600-1820, you will be greatly impressed at this game's attention to detail. Battles lack the ""arcade"" feel, while not being completely boring, especially if two players finally commit to a sea battle. Expect 30+ minutes of fighting where every shot counts, de-masts are devastating, and managing your crew/repairs both on the open sea and in battles are crucial to your career and survival. Digital ships are modelled straight from primary historical sources with amazing graphical fidelity.-Developers are active and intertwined with their community. While they are subject to criticism, apathy on the forums is not one of them. Funding does not seem to be an issue either, so do not expect development to stall purely because of money.-Scope. Macro-management. Immersion. While nowhere near its final implementation, I feel the developers' vision of nations full of players fighting/politicking/backstabbing/and monopolizing the Caribbean in a purely player-driven experience all with an 18th century flair can be fully realized. EVE Online is often used as inspiration in Naval Action's development, but it's clear the devs here are interested in striking their own path. Even lacking in its physical form, I feel this is still a pro in my eyes as so few games these days have this kind of ambition.So down to the final question: Should you buy it?My answer is: No. Until this game releases, I would not spend your money unless you're truly interested in shaping this game's future. Currently, it is still in VERY early development and ultimately boring once you've gotten your fill of the naval combat simulator Naval Action truly is at this point. Not an MMORPG. I eagerly await Naval Action's launch and to see if the developers' vision truly holds to their promises.-Carr			"

								I've been watching this game for awhile now but the tons of negative views kept me at bay... And that was stupid. This game is pretty great, as is evident by the tons of b****ing by people with 1,000-ish hours of playtime complaining which is generally a good sign that the underlying game is sound. The UI is rough around the edges, as is getting started. But once you move past that you're greated by a beautiful engine, fantastic physics with engaging and immersive gameplay. Waves will lift your cannons above the horizon making you miss shots, you won't pay attention to the wind and get your ship virtually stuck not moving, you'll have your main mast blown away by cannonfire... At the time of writing the player numbers are rather low as the devs are about to reset stats but it hasn't bothered me much. Still finding plenty to see and do and helpful players to talk, fight and interact with. A++ game, don't listen to the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning with hundreds of hours of playtime. There is a reason they keep coming back and are so mad, because the underlying game is pretty fantastic. tldr - 'real combat,' sweet physics; waves are real, cannon balls are real, rekt & get rekt. UI shi**y, rough around edges, but's it's an Alpha still. F**k da haters.			"

								A thinking person's game, with rich rewards for those who are cunning, patient and strategic.   I've had years of enjoyment from this game -- if you have any curiosity at all about sailing warfare, you must play this!!   If you are a student of the era, then this is the best time machine there is.  Should be required playing for authors and researchers.The in-battle simulation is awesome and the best ever at putting you in the captain's coat and experiencing the decision making for maneuvers, gaining the weather gage, speed, angles... Not only that, but plenty to satisfy the crafters, builders, and long-term political strategists too.  Well worth the $ in order to role play the Age of Sail lifestyle.			"

								This game has a lot of potential to become a great game, but in the state that it is currently in it isn't. The developers don't really see what will keep a gamer  playing their game and what wont. It is not player balanced with nations. Basically it is USA and Brits fighting. If you are a player that doens't like to struggle in a game then join the USA nation and be bored most of the time. If you would like to have a challange and maybe get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥daily by USA now and then, then you shoudld join one of the other many nations in this game.  Another thing that is pretty bad about this game is that the gameplay is pretty repetative gameplay. No matter if you are pulling some NPCs from a different nation or doing missions on your own, it is all the same thing it never changes or there isn't anything different on how the scenario can change depending on the weather or any other factor. My recomendation to those who are thinking of buying this game is that if you would like to spend the money to see how the game is, well just watch videos first of the game on Youtube and then make your decision. The grinding is a pain in the butt though.			"

								Considering that this game is in Early ALPHA, I'd say it's quite an experience!On my first exploration day I managed to capture (by grape-shooting crew) 2 ships: a Lynx and a Snow. This shows the freedom given to the player. Where in many other games gaining a new ship requires boarding, in Naval Action you can Craft it, Purchase it, Win it after a fight or, as said, Board it.The graphics are beautiful, the sounds are realistic and the controls and mechanics are enough intuitive and bearable even for someone like me that knows absolutely nothing about sailing and sailing-games.Of course, a long way lies ahead before this product will reach its final shape, but given the fair amount of fun I had today, I do feel optimistic.Recommended.

								Eversince I was very little I have been reading Napoleonic-Age novels and playing Napoleonic-Age-of-Sail games (anyone remember ""Wooden Ships & Iron Men""?). This is the ultimate achievement so far on sailing in the age of pirates and Admiral Nelson.You feel like you are actually standing on the deck of your ship. You can trade, fight and discover. You can also develop your skills as a captain, a tradesman and a crafter or shipbuilder.Being part of a clan makes it even more fun as you can have your friends help you and battle enemies together.Highly recommended!

								If you loved PotBS, you will love this game. This is basically the same game with a few better mechanics. + Firing require additionnal aiming, affected by the sea. + Graphics are much better+ World map is much larger, it has pro and cons but I believe it is better like this, players will be able to ""own"" regions since it would be really hard for anyone to quickly travel across the entire map for defense. It could easily take up to 6-8+ hours to cross the entire map.+ Economy is more simple, which is a bad and good thing. Everything is viable so there is no chance everybody end up producing the same thing like in other games due to the cost effectiveness. At the same time it remove a little of depth.+ Devs are creating events with special rewards / blueprints.+ Roles are more flexible, players can be at anytime a privateer / trader / navy officer.+ Can customize cannon pounding of each deck+ Damage is realistic, constantly shooting a mast will destroy it, same with rudder, crew etc.+ Navigation is pretty good, you can  control each individual mast, assign crew in sailing, repair, gunnery, survival, boarding.- UI is really ugly, in fact we keep discovering context menus or label that are actually clickable. At least, it quickly become the least of our concern.- Maybe it is not actually a con, but I know there are mortar ships in the game and while I have not personally been able to used them or see them in action, I am pretty sure they aren't a good addition to the game since the completly move away from the standard fighting style.Neutral : I am unsure whether or not update progress is fast yet since I have recently started. It look like the devs added a lot of content since then however the game still really feel like an alpha after 6 months. I would assume it could have been faster but I do not know the size of the team, at the same time making sure everything is tested throughly isntead of rushing through everything is a good thing.

								Okay so I will give this game a positive simply because there are none other like it. Graphics and combat system are excellent. MASSIVE open world with plenty of sailing to do.I would however like to see some more content into the game, you have to have a pretty wild imagination to keep you entertained. By content I mean give us something to do, something to fight for and something to come back to again and again.There is a hell of a lot of potential in this game, it remains to be seen whether the devs will make use of that potential or not.Holding thumbs			"

								This game covers the age of sail in a beautiful way. You can fight for yourself and your nation in epic battles. You can be a ship crafter that craft light ships, frigates or even ship of the line. If you like trading and getting good deals you will love it, but you might have to be a smuggler to get hold of the best deals. You can also become a pirate! All of this you can do in a huge open map with other players from all over the world.			"

								While the game is still in development, and the dev team are interested in feedback from the players, their obstinate refusal to offer anything close to realism in the way of maritime navigation is the deal-breaker for me. No matter how pretty you make the sunsets, no matter how detailed the ships, no matter the accuracy of the eye-candy for the period, having to rely on landmarks for navigation is possibly the stupidest game mechanic decision they have made. They give you a compass and what amounts to a speedometer, and tell you to navigate by sight. No concession to anything realistic about sailing is made. The world map is lovely, yet worthless in regard to getting from A to B. Yes, you can see the port you just departed from, and yes, you can see the port you may be attempting to reach. You can even see the crossed sabers indicating the position of the ship(s) you are instructed to sink, etc. What you are not given, and what you will be never given (unless the dev team comes down off their high horse) is any indication of where the hell you are on that same map. I played Pirates of the Burning Sea at launch, and then again 2 yrs ago. While Naval Action is in the ""simulation"" category, and PotBS was not, for all of its faults, PotBS was a better game. It had character and style. NA has plenty of screenshot-worthy moments, but the ludicrous and intentional lack of navigation realism cannot but render this game to me anything beyond a mobile Geoff Hunt painting. If you want to sail a pretty ship around scanning the horizon for a landmark to fix your position, then buy the game.  I think I'll uninstall for now and come back when the game is finished. Maybe, by then, the devs will realize that their desire for players to experience being ""lost at sea"" because navigation tools like an octant or a sextant would make it too easy is a cop-out.I have not, and will not say anything about the lack of tutorial, etc. because it IS an Early Access game. If you have a couple of spare $20 bills lying around, buy the game. If you would rather see your money put to better use, send it to me and help me pay off my student loans.			"

								A thinking person's game, with rich rewards for those who are cunning, patient and strategic.   I've had years of enjoyment from this game -- if you have any curiosity at all about sailing warfare, you must play this!!   If you are a student of the era, then this is the best time machine there is.  Should be required playing for authors and researchers.The in-battle simulation is awesome and the best ever at putting you in the captain's coat and experiencing the decision making for maneuvers, gaining the weather gage, speed, angles... Not only that, but plenty to satisfy the crafters, builders, and long-term political strategists too.  Well worth the $ in order to role play the Age of Sail lifestyle.			"

								I've never written a review before, but I have to admit that Naval Action is finally a good enough game to get me off my♥♥♥♥♥to write a review. I'm a history buff who loves the Age of Sail, the ever-growing variety of ships, and the pvp-centric nature of the game. After having left several succesive MMO's due to boredom this is finaly the game I have been looking for.I also have to give props the the staff of Naval Action for creating one of the most polished Alpha testing periods I have ever seen. In a time when MMO's are riddled with bugs on launch, I have to hand to them - this game is smooth.Would highly recommend this game and I will certainly continue to play Naval Action for the forseeable future.

								This game has a lot of potential to become a great game, but in the state that it is currently in it isn't. The developers don't really see what will keep a gamer  playing their game and what wont. It is not player balanced with nations. Basically it is USA and Brits fighting. If you are a player that doens't like to struggle in a game then join the USA nation and be bored most of the time. If you would like to have a challange and maybe get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥daily by USA now and then, then you shoudld join one of the other many nations in this game.  Another thing that is pretty bad about this game is that the gameplay is pretty repetative gameplay. No matter if you are pulling some NPCs from a different nation or doing missions on your own, it is all the same thing it never changes or there isn't anything different on how the scenario can change depending on the weather or any other factor. My recomendation to those who are thinking of buying this game is that if you would like to spend the money to see how the game is, well just watch videos first of the game on Youtube and then make your decision. The grinding is a pain in the butt though.			"

								Naval Action has very few bugs and has very good gameplay, having both a low skill floor, and a high skill ceiling, which are usually the biggest problems when a game is released. The economy system is currently very unstable due to the low player base, and once the player base grows so does the potential. The crafting system could use some tweaking, for instance they could add a project tracker where no matter what tab you are in on the crafting menu you can see what you need in order to build that new ship, and with the low player base getting a new ship can be a pain sometimes, but it has potential. The battles are very fun, and it is very satisfying to set an enemy ship on fire and watch as it sails next to one of its allies and blows up, although it can be quite anticlimactic when you fire one broadside and sink the ship, because you got lucky and all the shots went under the water line when the ship was rolling away from you.I have 60 hours put into the game and have yet to see one bug or crash.I would say it is better quality than some games that are already released, and Naval Action is still in alpha testing. As others have said the biggest issue is probably the UI. The UI is very simple and easy to use but it isnt very pretty. If you dont mind having a very minimalistic UI in your menu screens, then I would definately recommend this game.			"

								Here is my short note about current feelings :Great game for anyone who is over 30 like me now or under 30 like i was and tried and later loved real sailing , great game for everyone who loved Pirates! in the old days, just awesome for every Pirates Ahoy! www hobbyst, refreshing for all Sea Dogs vets, and in the end for EVERYONE. Naval Action still rocks and sing about Drunken Sailor even now in Early Access. Great future. Just WORK HARD DEVS.It is best game about historic sailing ever created. Don't stop with updates. 8/10+ :+ game even now is very relaxing !+ offers countless hours of plain sailing fun+ ship models are just..... my God+ battles are good+ if You even want to try how it feels to sail here You can+ sounds, immersion, feeling of climate+ just great+ many people playing- : (but it's early access)- lack of tips, tutorial, kind of introduction- lack of features like more port styles- UI needs some work- lack of ability to walk on deck in FPP {like in Sea Dogs}\- it just screams for some (even text ) ""adventure"" options  like in old Sid Meier's Pirates! - it NEED CLEAR and IMMERSIVE - TRADE system with some nice UI - models are great but damage model could be more detailed like in War Thunder mmo- sails, flags , needs more physics- we need freaking COMPASS on the screen "

However this game is NOT EVE: Age of Sail, there are some sharp differences on all levels but the MOST IMPORTANT: Aiming matters.

								One of my first reviews because this game deserves itFirstly the developers have obviously put a lot of thought in to this game and continue to add fixes and patches, really great work on their part. I was scepticle with this game at first I've tried games alike to this in the past and although they were good there was nothing that made them gripping, this game seriously has it all.The graphics are actually amazing for this game, they also keep adding little tweaks which make them more intense as the patches come out. The clans are great use and you are part of nations opposing every other nation, get in the right clan and its 24/7 game play.You can play this game in several ways depending on what you want to achieve. You can play as a trader and make your money, you can also combine that and be a crafter making ships for others to buy from you. The crafting aspect is actually very good, one being that you don't just get automatic rights to craft anything you like, it creates more thinking and a tech tree to follow, one part makes this part and you only get a certain amount of labour you can use per hour which means people can't gain silly amounts of advantage. Also you have to craft certain types of ships with just a small % of a chance you'll get the blue prints to other ships meaning it takes time and tactic to be able to craft different ships.Now if you go for the battle side this is a very broad game play. We have port battles, PvP or just plain old hunt the AI. I must admit alot of thought has gone into this; you need to be able to think, control and watch. The devs keep patching this area and adding or smoothing out the tweaks and doing an amazing job for it. When sailing in battle you have to think which direction you are going, where your sails are pointing how much sail you have, how many people on guns, how many people on plugging leaks. It really is in depth as a game gets for this area you quite literally can control everything. Overall I would extremely recommend this game and urge anyone thinking to get this. The price tag is worth it!!! Constant patches and planned improvements that are set this game to be one you won't get bored on. I've clocked so many hours and the worst part is I never saw those hours go by, its truly addictive when you join the right clan community; my main tip is to join a clan to maximise every aspect of this game.

								An open-world combat and trading experience, Naval Action is a pretty damn good sailing game. It is heavily in alpha, however: UI elements are plainly unfinished, there are very few tooltips to help anyone get started, and even statistics are poorly formatted and explained.With all that being said, what exactly are you getting?You're getting an open world experience whereby you sail around, encounter enemy players (read: not a member of your nation) and then challenge them to battle. You and them begin an instanced ship-on-ship battle whereby you can either stand and fight or run by avoiding fire for a minute or so.Ship customization isn't here yet, though equipment and crafting is. It is possible, but difficult, to craft an entire ship from scratch by buying the components for it. Obtaining these resources other than buying them, however, is apparently not possible.The game prides itself more towards realism than arcade simulation: physics make targeting enemies on the open sea difficult, as both your ship and the enemy ship bob and crest with waves. There is a map, but it does not tell you where you are. You have to navigate the world the old-fashioned way: using your compass.It does support PvP and PvE servers, and in PvE you can only fight NPC ships. In PvP you can be challenged by just about anyone, and trading becomes far more challenging. Hiring fleet vessels to protect you in a PvP scenario is a must.Overall, it's highly unpolished but well worth $55 CAD. If you like this concept, but are intimidated by its skill ceiling, take a look at the Steam game Windward instead.			"

Early Access Review
								At time of writing Naval Action is still in its early access alpha phase. So if you start to play this you have to come in with the right mind set. It's not finished and things are are changed around and tweaked by the developers all the time. New stuff is also being added, for example national diplomacy just went in.Ok so assuming you are happy to run with the alpha state of the game what are you getting? Well it is what it says on the tin. 18th Century sailing ships ( plus or minus a few decades ) sailing round the carribean doing their thing. You pick a nation when you initially load up and that is locked ( you used to be able to become a pirate inside the game but im not sure if thats still the case after the last patch). The various nations have been perpetually at war taking and retaking each others ports for the last few months, unofficial alliances created by the larger of the games clans held or didnt, we'll have to see how the new diplomacy meta game changes things.The game itself is beautiful, you wont be disapointed with how it looks. My rig is pretty awesome at the moment top end and under 6 months old but my last machine was a few years old and still ran things at a good frame rate and with quality settings. The ship models are nicely crafted and you can tell the artist/s have howned their techniques over the years as the newer ones are looking decidedly nicer than the first ships that came out. This is mostly in the texture work though and I'm 100% sure upgrade work is on the backlog.Ship to Ship combat is handled on an instanced basis. You sail along in the Open World, tag your target and head into an instance to fight. I was initially quite disappointed with this approach but got used to it it. There are pro's and con's to it but it is what it is. The combat itself is the most involved and worked on part of the game, once you get your head round the initial mechanics it one of those easy to learn hard to master things. Same goes for sailing ( in the instances ). You need to use both rudder and sail direction to aid your turning through the wind.In fact everything Naval Action does it does very well. You may not like a particual direction the developers have decided to take something but they will have done a good job of it. Problem with Naval Action ( if it is indeed a problem ) is the stuff they haven't done. If you came at this game after playing something like Assassins Creed Black Flag ( like I did ) then you will be disappointed with no avatars. Theres no walking around your ships, or getting out and exploring islands, boarding is handled in a very simplistic UI manner. To be honest i can't see this sort of thing ever changing. They are too small a team and the cost implications of doing full on character art/animation/traversable enviroments are so unbelievably massive that they will never be able to do these things. It's a shame but it doesnt spoil the game they have made, it would just have made it more utterly amazing!But if you set your expectations to the right level, read around the reviews, check out the official forums. If you have an interest in the period and sailing then i think you will enjoy this game. Make sure you ask questions in the various chat channels, people are usually very helpful and willing to show new players the ropes.			"

								When I hopped into the game, I was unaware that it was in alpha. For it being so early, I think this game is fantastic. I really love the graphics and gameplay. The combat system is really fun, and fairly realistic. Whether you want to play PvE or PvP, you can play on what seem like nicely located servers, allowing for low enough ping. With only 3 servers so far, two for North America and one for Europe, I can see some more to allow easier world wide access in the future. The only ""issue"" I have run into is a slight delay in actions, which you would not think a mere ~100 ping would give, but once you get used to it the game is lovely.			"

Beautiful graphics and stunning sound design. 9/10 would recommend to jsut about anyone who I think would be interested in such a game,			"

								This game covers the age of sail in a beautiful way. You can fight for yourself and your nation in epic battles. You can be a ship crafter that craft light ships, frigates or even ship of the line. If you like trading and getting good deals you will love it, but you might have to be a smuggler to get hold of the best deals. You can also become a pirate! All of this you can do in a huge open map with other players from all over the world.			"

								While the game is still in development, and the dev team are interested in feedback from the players, their obstinate refusal to offer anything close to realism in the way of maritime navigation is the deal-breaker for me. No matter how pretty you make the sunsets, no matter how detailed the ships, no matter the accuracy of the eye-candy for the period, having to rely on landmarks for navigation is possibly the stupidest game mechanic decision they have made. They give you a compass and what amounts to a speedometer, and tell you to navigate by sight. No concession to anything realistic about sailing is made. The world map is lovely, yet worthless in regard to getting from A to B. Yes, you can see the port you just departed from, and yes, you can see the port you may be attempting to reach. You can even see the crossed sabers indicating the position of the ship(s) you are instructed to sink, etc. What you are not given, and what you will be never given (unless the dev team comes down off their high horse) is any indication of where the hell you are on that same map. I played Pirates of the Burning Sea at launch, and then again 2 yrs ago. While Naval Action is in the ""simulation"" category, and PotBS was not, for all of its faults, PotBS was a better game. It had character and style. NA has plenty of screenshot-worthy moments, but the ludicrous and intentional lack of navigation realism cannot but render this game to me anything beyond a mobile Geoff Hunt painting. If you want to sail a pretty ship around scanning the horizon for a landmark to fix your position, then buy the game.  I think I'll uninstall for now and come back when the game is finished. Maybe, by then, the devs will realize that their desire for players to experience being ""lost at sea"" because navigation tools like an octant or a sextant would make it too easy is a cop-out.I have not, and will not say anything about the lack of tutorial, etc. because it IS an Early Access game. If you have a couple of spare $20 bills lying around, buy the game. If you would rather see your money put to better use, send it to me and help me pay off my student loans.			"

								Naval Action is something that can be taken the wrong way or bought in vain if you are unaware of what you are getting into, so this review is to help.I myself am a huge Age of Sail fanatic, so I have long been anticipating the release of this game, I was just able to get my hands on it just before release and I must say, the game is very satisfying. As for if you will like it, that is going to be covered in the section below, as for overall what you need to keep in mind this factor, which as in most games is in NA: Grinding.Requirements to enjoy this title: Not Pros or Conds just ""if you apply to these, then get it""Passion for Age of Sail or Open Mind, if you are pickey and not particularly interested, dont even try.Decent PC, the game is graphics intensive but it is worth it, it is such a beutiful game.Time, you either need to have lots of free time or be willing to accept smaller amounts of progress for less time.There are various others but those are the main headers that should be noted. As for cons, well, here are some I can name:$1600 gaming PC cant run this game much bove low settings.The gameplay becomes repetetive, but in all fairness, real life Age of Sail was even duller than this.Open world FPS is very low if PC is not powerfull enough and needs overall polishing. [Early Access, subject to change]And here are some warnings that I just thought I would throw out there, not pros or cons, just to be aware of:Though this game is not for younger kids I still would like to put it out there that there is some inapropriate content for children in the art of the vessels sternplates and bow designs.The game has some semi-official factions that you can find on the forums such as the ""SLRN"" which operate in unity and perform raids and defend ports, etc. for those who are a bit more committed.Anyways, that would bring my review to an end, I give this game a 8/10, and for it being an Early Access title with much more planned I give it a 10 out of 10, but that is assuming they are adding much more content as they promise such as a better UI and more ships, smoother open world, etc.[This review comes from a Age of Sail fan who has played PotBS as well as other well known titles, and rest asured, this blows them all right out of the water. And if you need a quote from all of this it is: ""THIS GAME IS AWESOME""]			"

								A thinking person's game, with rich rewards for those who are cunning, patient and strategic.   I've had years of enjoyment from this game -- if you have any curiosity at all about sailing warfare, you must play this!!   If you are a student of the era, then this is the best time machine there is.  Should be required playing for authors and researchers.The in-battle simulation is awesome and the best ever at putting you in the captain's coat and experiencing the decision making for maneuvers, gaining the weather gage, speed, angles... Not only that, but plenty to satisfy the crafters, builders, and long-term political strategists too.  Well worth the $ in order to role play the Age of Sail lifestyle.			"

								Purchased this game because it reminded me of an updated version of Sid Meir's Pirates! Gold version from back in the 90's. Not that remade dribble that is being sold on Steam right now. Upon starting, I selected to be a pirate and within minutes I was asked to join a group, set sail to a location south of the town I started in and began battle with two pirate hunters. My two other group mates and I engaged in battle (which is visually awesome) and took those hunters out with pride. I quickly ran to my liquor cabinet, grabbed a bottle of Sailor Jerry and chugged it with glee upon our victory. Then I had to go watch Super Bowl 50. Great game! Buy early access and support these guys! 10/10 rating.			"

								This game has some of the best naval combat out there. Tactics and strategy are important in both setting up an engagement and once the battle as begun. The player base has taken a hit in recent months, associated with some questionable discussion over ship wipes and the big development picture, but overall there's nothing like this game on the market.Unfortunately the developers appear to have gone off the deep end recently, and intend on splitting the player base between time zones EU/NZ/AUS/US, unfortunately this means that our already small player base will become even smaller. With this in mind it will be very difficult to find meaningful content by way of encountering other players to both trade with, sail with or setup RvR battles that need 50 people.I'm going to switch my recommendation to no, until they devs can show that they can turn it around.

								This game is in alpha which means unfinished. So beaware and have low expectations. Still well functional and interesting open world game though; teamwork and coop is essential to making it. After playing this game I can say it is a good sailing and naval warfare simulator; however due to the unfinished nature of the game and its grinding XP and gold mechanics; it gets repetitive and a little sluggish after a while. Still good fun to capture and shoot down ships with your mates and add to your fleet; but the gameplay mechanics are a little too limited in order to keep you interested in sinking (no pun) money and time into this franchise.

There is an option fo that style of battles that cna be done, but you still have to grind up the level and earn/craft ships.  People need ot remember this is an Early Release Alpha so you are basicly a play tester for the game until it goes live.			"

								 With over a thousand hours played I think it's fair to say I've already gotten my moneys worth from this game which is still in alpha. The graphics, combat, community and sanbox feel of the game really keep me playing. Once you get yourself into some of the larger ships and begin opening different ports the game really opens itself up and offers a lot of options to the players. Some days I run trade routes some days I attack traders running their routes some days are spent attacking enemy ports others defending our nations ports or helping an ally nation in it's goals. The battles are fun ranging from 1 on 1 to epic 25 on 25 battles. The combat has a slight learning curve it's not hard to catch on and be competent but there are a lot of little nuances that can be learned which really makes putting in the effort to learn very rewarding. Naval action is still in it's alpha phase and it shows in things like it's user interface which the developers plan to keep very basic until other parts of the game are developed. Patches come rather frequently from the Dev team with various add ons to game play, added ships, and rebalancing. Some players may be turned off by the constant tweaks but for the most part the changes coincide with the opinions of its active player base. I've played quite a few early releases and I must say it's refreshing to see developers constantly moving forward on what i see as quite an ambitious project. I highly recomend this for anyone interested in pirates and age of sail naval battles. This is the best thing going since Sid Maiers Pirates for you old school gamers.			"

								Whilst this game remains very much a work in progress, the Naval combat element is very well flushed out and plays majestically, if you fancy some age of sail style combat there is already more then enough in place for this to be a recommendation.If you prefer the more sedate life of trading then you'd be better off waiting until that element has a proper UI in place as for everything but the naval battles the game remains largely place holder UI.Eventually I believe the game will satisfy all comers but for the here and now just Naval battle fans need apply, and if that sounds appealing welcome aboard, the lovely community is sure to welcome you with open arms.

								This game is great. I will mention that it is Alpha right now and its basically down to either fighting or trading/crafting. The best part about this game is you can decide what you want to do, adapt your own strategies against ships, and the overall freedom of a large map at your disposal. The community is mature and seems to be helpful. Being able to take ports from other nations, and having it affect the economy and politics of the map is great.There have already been alliances made between nations and clans within the game. Player driven economy and conquest really makes this game great.I truly hope the devs stick to this game because the potential for a good naval action game is already in place. Great start!			"

								An excellent start. Imagine Pirates! without the flair and character, just the open world and ship combat. Really if this title wants to be legendary, they'll just turn it into an open world Pirates! and call it a day. If the devs don't do that, then someone else will or Sid may dust off the Pirates! franchise and deliver what everyone wants. Till that day comes, enjoy. I will say however that the ship combat is problematic. At times it doesn't really feel like your cannons do anything. Causing magazine explosions really seems to be just random chance luck. Ammo like grape shot is very problematic and you'll often times kill more enemy crew with regular balls than grape. Chain shot does work but again, finicky. It often takes a lot of sustained chain shot fire to make any tangible dent in the sails.Frankly, I don't think the early access is worth the $40 price. You have to like this kind of gameplay or be a Pirates! fan to justify $40. The devs probably don't know they are asking too much for what is there. $20-$30 would be resonable for what is here. In the end you are buying potential. If the devs do not execute, it'll be forgotten and another dev, maybe even Sid, will come out with something that will make this look something a kid barfed up. But if they do execute, it'll be much harder on any other dev trying to churn out a similar title. This will be the benchmark.			"

								I love this game, I have put about 40 hours into it now and I got hooked to it the day I bought it. Naval Action is a open world ship sailing MMO simulator. It is very similar to Eve if anyone knows about it, but it isn't as overwhelming as Eve. There is several different nations you can choose from, from the major players back in the 1700s like Great Britian and Spain, to the smaller nations like Sweden, Dutch, and even the Pirates. There is trading, crafting, and conquering territory with other people in the nation that you choose. There are PVE and PVP servers, both in US and EU. The map is the entire Carribean, with the entire coast line from half way up the Eastern US, all the way down to the Northern coastline of Brazil. There are a huge amount of ports you can travel to and see what they produce and in what quantities as you plan out trade routes to make money or to craft ships, items, upgrades, etc. As you level up, you can sail bigger ships more proficiently as you are able to command more crew to sail these larger ships. Surprisingly, I have yet to see bugs besides a small graphical glitch when sailing around. One thing thing that can be a pro or a con is that traveling to different places takes time while in the open world part of the game. You can simply alt-tab or watch a video on another monitor, if you have one, to pass the time. When you are in the open world sailing around, the wind matters a lot in how you travel around, so you must plan accordingly or it will take forever to get to the place you want to go, and wind defintely matters in battles you get into. When you get into a battle, you and the other party will be put into an instance and other people from the two nations can join the battle while it is going on, but they have five minutes to do so before the battle is locked to the players or AI within the battle. In battle, you can sink other ships, board them and capture their ship, or run away if you feel the battle isn't going into your favor, but the enemy can stop you from running away if they can hit you at least once every one minute and 30 seconds.It is still far from finished and the devs seem pretty decent as they listen to the feedback the community gives. Also, they have plenty of ships being added into the game as the game moves through early access, along with UI changes and other features added to the game.I just have to say I am addicted and can't wait to play more of this game.

								I haven't been playing long and I'm still levelling up my characters on both the PVP and PVE servers.Although it's an early access game, Naval Action is already a great game which can only get better. The graphics are very pretty. I like the idea of having a PVE server where I can relax and learn the game without fear of being ganked. The game is a bit like Pirates of the Burning Sea with much better graphics and way better battle mechanics. All in all my money was well spent.			"

								Having aspirations to become a naval officer and chagrined I will likely never have the chance to captain a warship under independent command (given my country's pitifully small navy), I took great interest in Naval Action. While rather pricey for a game still in an open alpha, the game itself is quite fun – with new content being added regularly.While still a game in active development with quite a few flaws and the sometimes painfully repetitious grinding for higher ranks/manpower/resources to make components to construct ships, the freedom afforded in the game is outstanding. Learning optimal angles to sail in the wind, manoeuvring to ripple off broadside after broadside at foes with great plumes of gunsmoke obscuring your vessel, your battleline - and ominously, that of the enemy. The ability to board an enemy vessel to take a grand prize for yourself and the crew. This game exudes the spirit of the Napoleonic era.More than that, nothing quite beats the exhilaration of participating in a PVP fleet action in a wee 7th rate cutter against 4th and 5th rate enemy ships.  The stark terror of the sea about your small ship awash from a 25-gun broadside of 18 pound shot, with a mere six-gun broadside of 6-pounder shot to reply with.			"

								In some ways acting as a successor to Pirates of the Burning sea, Naval action is a far more realistic voyage into naval combat. The game has a large focus on trade, and the major nations must struggle for control over all of the major trading ports in their attempt to acheive naval superiority. Large scale naval battles are acheived in a grand fashion, with beautifully rendered oceans, and ships. Smoke billows off of freshly fired cannons, and drifts away slowly with the breeze. Battles in Naval action require a bit of practice, and an understanding of basic seamanship will help asspiring captains greatly. The action here is slower than many games, and requires a bit of tactical positioning; it is critical that players learn to use the wind to their advantage if wishing to avoid destruction.Naval action is still in early access and has a number of issues at the moment.While the game is lovely, this graphical fidelity comes at a performance cost; further optimizations will hopefully reduce the strain on mid-range systems such as my own, but with my rig the game is perfectly playable. The UI leaves much to be desired as well, as the developers have opted to use a placeholder GUI while they work on core mechanics. This issue should easily be resolved in the coming months.CPU:i5-3750k 2.6ghz - OC 4.0ghzNvidia Geforce 660ti 16gb ddr3 ramWhile It might not be for everyone, I personally rate Naval Action at ~ 9/10.Technical issues keep me from giving it a perfect score, but I fully expect those to be resolved at a steady pace.

								This is a PVE viewpoint only.

Which is sorely needed. They still need to learn that you can not use the same rules for both PVP and PVE servers. They are totaly different play styles and types, and you just can not cram them both into the same rule sets without creating issues for one or the other at times.So, with the above caveats, I will say yes on the recommendation for now, and hope they continue to add to the PVE gameplay.  This is still one of the best PVE sailing ship games around right now, and has a ton of potential to be much better, or ruined completely. Praying hard for the ""much better"" option here:)			"

								I've been watching this game for awhile now but the tons of negative views kept me at bay... And that was stupid. This game is pretty great, as is evident by the tons of b****ing by people with 1,000-ish hours of playtime complaining which is generally a good sign that the underlying game is sound. The UI is rough around the edges, as is getting started. But once you move past that you're greated by a beautiful engine, fantastic physics with engaging and immersive gameplay. Waves will lift your cannons above the horizon making you miss shots, you won't pay attention to the wind and get your ship virtually stuck not moving, you'll have your main mast blown away by cannonfire... At the time of writing the player numbers are rather low as the devs are about to reset stats but it hasn't bothered me much. Still finding plenty to see and do and helpful players to talk, fight and interact with. A++ game, don't listen to the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning with hundreds of hours of playtime. There is a reason they keep coming back and are so mad, because the underlying game is pretty fantastic. tldr - 'real combat,' sweet physics; waves are real, cannon balls are real, rekt & get rekt. UI shi**y, rough around edges, but's it's an Alpha still. F**k da haters.			"

Early Access Review
								Naval Action presents one of the most unique and revolutionary attempts at melding an MMORPG with a ""World of Warships"" style gameplay. As someone with 600+ hours and on a hiatus since this game's Early Access Steam launch, I can truly say that this is one of the more ambitious games on the market which will unfortunately be both its strength and weakness. It goes without saying that Naval Action will be in early access for the indefinite future, with many massive features such as whether there will be an ""over world"" section of the game or not still on the chopping block. This and many other important ""MMORPG"" aspects such as trading, PvP, PvE, in my eyes are still yet to be finalized by the developers' vision, which I confirmed after observing discussions of this game's future with developers on their Naval Action forums. It is important to list this project's current faults to anyone considering purchase in the forseeable future (months or so from writing this review at the least):-Player population is dismal. Will spike when major content releases like most MMORPGs experience player traffic, however Naval Action is considerably more niche in the genre and sees maybe 1000~ players on generous days. When Naval Action releases on Steam fully, it must truly be impressive to maintain a truly enjoyable playerbase for a game of this scope.-Most population/interest is focused in the European zone. If you want a truly ""massive"" experience, you will learn to accept European latency. -Development is slow and often times due not just to a small dev team, but rather their circular decisions on some core aspects of the game. For instance, in the short few weeks I was active the dev team consistently patched varying versions of the ""PvP tag circle"" mechanic which would initiate battles. While a rather divisive issue in the community, the developers' responses/patches were usually delayed and they ultimately went back and forth on their decision to this mechanic multiple times. I wonder how much developer time was wasted on this indecisiveness, when they could have been improving other aspects of this game so desperately lacking? (PvE, Exploring, Tracking, Economy, Quests, UI, etc.) -Bare bones. The combat simulator portion of this game is enjoyable, but so far Naval Action fails to sell the idea that you are a Naval Captain in a truly massive conflict where players pull the strings. Expect dull trade runs, ""fishing"" by pressing a button, zero quests, and very boring PvE battles to farm up ranks to use better ships. Casual players beware.Now let's discuss the positive aspects of Naval Action:-If you're a fan of historical naval tactics, engagements, naval vessels, etc. from about 1600-1820, you will be greatly impressed at this game's attention to detail. Battles lack the ""arcade"" feel, while not being completely boring, especially if two players finally commit to a sea battle. Expect 30+ minutes of fighting where every shot counts, de-masts are devastating, and managing your crew/repairs both on the open sea and in battles are crucial to your career and survival. Digital ships are modelled straight from primary historical sources with amazing graphical fidelity.-Developers are active and intertwined with their community. While they are subject to criticism, apathy on the forums is not one of them. Funding does not seem to be an issue either, so do not expect development to stall purely because of money.-Scope. Macro-management. Immersion. While nowhere near its final implementation, I feel the developers' vision of nations full of players fighting/politicking/backstabbing/and monopolizing the Caribbean in a purely player-driven experience all with an 18th century flair can be fully realized. EVE Online is often used as inspiration in Naval Action's development, but it's clear the devs here are interested in striking their own path. Even lacking in its physical form, I feel this is still a pro in my eyes as so few games these days have this kind of ambition.So down to the final question: Should you buy it?My answer is: No. Until this game releases, I would not spend your money unless you're truly interested in shaping this game's future. Currently, it is still in VERY early development and ultimately boring once you've gotten your fill of the naval combat simulator Naval Action truly is at this point. Not an MMORPG. I eagerly await Naval Action's launch and to see if the developers' vision truly holds to their promises.-Carr			"

								Switching from negative to posite and back to negative... Back and forth, just like ping-pong. TL;DR Buy this game only if you are desperated for Age of Sail game with nice graphics - otherwise avoid / wait till final release.Good things that changed in last months / weeks:1. Port Battles in land2. Battlescreen changesBad things:1. Overhelming number of bugs / exploits / problems / crashes (known by Devs and planned to be fixed in the future, gamebreaking problems but yet Devs decide in meanwhile to add Pray Button that is supposedly a trolling easter egg, but no one knows, even Devs don't know. They prefer to work on some stupid new structural damage model that no one was asking them for, because the current one is simple and works perfectly. They prefer to add also fishing mechanic that does not influence gameplay in any way at all, just a decoration). If there are small / big bugs and exploits in the game for like 6-7 months or even more, they should hold the work on all big patches and fix all bugs / problems with the highest priority.2. Very little suggestions being implemented from what playerbase suggested. Even if they add something what players suggested, usually they implement it in the very day way, not how it was initially suggested / planned and if their implementation fails utterly, they blame playerbase for suggesting this. Example: Fellvred Small Battle Event, event ran everyday by a player to create nice PvP on the server, rewards, leaderboards, balanced and even battles. Devs noticed the huge interest in that (30-60 participants everyday) and decided to add something ""similar"". What they did is 2 zones on the map called Admiralty Event aka PvP Event. What is it? Gank fest, gank others or be ganked. Getting jumped by 10-25 ships while being solo or 5 small frigates chased by 5 SOLs (ships of the line). Either come in bigger fleet, either come in bigger ships or either runaway arround from dread fleets. Very often these events are empty or one-sided (e.g. 20+ US players in the zone and only a few enemies). 3. Hard communication with Devs, they rather say nothing if not needed, because they are scared of players using their own words against them4. Problems with changelogs, ninja-patches with no information what has been changed. Nerfs and buffs without details, because Devs prefare not to make players angry. For example they nerf a ship speed from 15 knots to 14 knots and will call it in changelog ""Speed of several ships adjusted"" if there will be any changelog at all...5. Lack of interest for Devs to ban all exploiters in the game. Players using alts exploiting game mechanics etc. They rather use their all effort to fight these that put negative reviews or try to say that they are doing something wrong. They report these reviews to Steam, try to make them be removed, warn players and sometimes threaten with the ban on forums or in-game. Yet they claim that they got no enough time or proof evidence to investigate obvious cases of exploiting on purpose. No one has ever been banned in this game for using exploits, that's the fact.6. Banning players that disagree or have different opinion (in-game and on forums)			"

								I am fan of MMO and Pirates theme. I bought the game follwing all the good reviews from the community.Well, it was a huge disapointment.First, the community is great IF you say the game is perfect. If you catch any flaws, you are acused of beeing a troll but this so called ""great community"".Now, for the game itself.I could not fix switchable graphics card. The program allways was making the default render card the windows card, even the card software was forcing the 3D card to render the game.Then, there is no place to learn the mechanics. Well hard to pay that kind of money to try to figure out if the mechanic of the game works. Its not intuitive so you have to place a lot of effort to start to figure out what to do.I tried a battle, felt simplistic.I know its in EA but still, didnt catch me up after a short try. Maybe will come back when the game is more developed.			"

								This game has some of the best naval combat out there. Tactics and strategy are important in both setting up an engagement and once the battle as begun. The player base has taken a hit in recent months, associated with some questionable discussion over ship wipes and the big development picture, but overall there's nothing like this game on the market.Unfortunately the developers appear to have gone off the deep end recently, and intend on splitting the player base between time zones EU/NZ/AUS/US, unfortunately this means that our already small player base will become even smaller. With this in mind it will be very difficult to find meaningful content by way of encountering other players to both trade with, sail with or setup RvR battles that need 50 people.I'm going to switch my recommendation to no, until they devs can show that they can turn it around.

								This game is in alpha which means unfinished. So beaware and have low expectations. Still well functional and interesting open world game though; teamwork and coop is essential to making it. After playing this game I can say it is a good sailing and naval warfare simulator; however due to the unfinished nature of the game and its grinding XP and gold mechanics; it gets repetitive and a little sluggish after a while. Still good fun to capture and shoot down ships with your mates and add to your fleet; but the gameplay mechanics are a little too limited in order to keep you interested in sinking (no pun) money and time into this franchise.

The action here is slower than many games, and requires a bit of tactical positioning; it is critical that players learn to use the wind to their advantage if wishing to avoid destruction.Naval action is still in early access and has a number of issues at the moment.While the game is lovely, this graphical fidelity comes at a performance cost; further optimizations will hopefully reduce the strain on mid-range systems such as my own, but with my rig the game is perfectly playable. The UI leaves much to be desired as well, as the developers have opted to use a placeholder GUI while they work on core mechanics. This issue should easily be resolved in the coming months.CPU:i5-3750k 2.6ghz - OC 4.0ghzNvidia Geforce 660ti 16gb ddr3 ramWhile It might not be for everyone, I personally rate Naval Action at ~ 9/10.Technical issues keep me from giving it a perfect score, but I fully expect those to be resolved at a steady pace.

Early Access Review
								Naval Action presents one of the most unique and revolutionary attempts at melding an MMORPG with a ""World of Warships"" style gameplay. As someone with 600+ hours and on a hiatus since this game's Early Access Steam launch, I can truly say that this is one of the more ambitious games on the market which will unfortunately be both its strength and weakness. It goes without saying that Naval Action will be in early access for the indefinite future, with many massive features such as whether there will be an ""over world"" section of the game or not still on the chopping block. This and many other important ""MMORPG"" aspects such as trading, PvP, PvE, in my eyes are still yet to be finalized by the developers' vision, which I confirmed after observing discussions of this game's future with developers on their Naval Action forums. It is important to list this project's current faults to anyone considering purchase in the forseeable future (months or so from writing this review at the least):-Player population is dismal. Will spike when major content releases like most MMORPGs experience player traffic, however Naval Action is considerably more niche in the genre and sees maybe 1000~ players on generous days. When Naval Action releases on Steam fully, it must truly be impressive to maintain a truly enjoyable playerbase for a game of this scope.-Most population/interest is focused in the European zone. If you want a truly ""massive"" experience, you will learn to accept European latency. -Development is slow and often times due not just to a small dev team, but rather their circular decisions on some core aspects of the game. For instance, in the short few weeks I was active the dev team consistently patched varying versions of the ""PvP tag circle"" mechanic which would initiate battles. While a rather divisive issue in the community, the developers' responses/patches were usually delayed and they ultimately went back and forth on their decision to this mechanic multiple times. I wonder how much developer time was wasted on this indecisiveness, when they could have been improving other aspects of this game so desperately lacking? (PvE, Exploring, Tracking, Economy, Quests, UI, etc.) -Bare bones. The combat simulator portion of this game is enjoyable, but so far Naval Action fails to sell the idea that you are a Naval Captain in a truly massive conflict where players pull the strings. Expect dull trade runs, ""fishing"" by pressing a button, zero quests, and very boring PvE battles to farm up ranks to use better ships. Casual players beware.Now let's discuss the positive aspects of Naval Action:-If you're a fan of historical naval tactics, engagements, naval vessels, etc. from about 1600-1820, you will be greatly impressed at this game's attention to detail. Battles lack the ""arcade"" feel, while not being completely boring, especially if two players finally commit to a sea battle. Expect 30+ minutes of fighting where every shot counts, de-masts are devastating, and managing your crew/repairs both on the open sea and in battles are crucial to your career and survival. Digital ships are modelled straight from primary historical sources with amazing graphical fidelity.-Developers are active and intertwined with their community. While they are subject to criticism, apathy on the forums is not one of them. Funding does not seem to be an issue either, so do not expect development to stall purely because of money.-Scope. Macro-management. Immersion. While nowhere near its final implementation, I feel the developers' vision of nations full of players fighting/politicking/backstabbing/and monopolizing the Caribbean in a purely player-driven experience all with an 18th century flair can be fully realized. EVE Online is often used as inspiration in Naval Action's development, but it's clear the devs here are interested in striking their own path. Even lacking in its physical form, I feel this is still a pro in my eyes as so few games these days have this kind of ambition.So down to the final question: Should you buy it?My answer is: No. Until this game releases, I would not spend your money unless you're truly interested in shaping this game's future. Currently, it is still in VERY early development and ultimately boring once you've gotten your fill of the naval combat simulator Naval Action truly is at this point. Not an MMORPG. I eagerly await Naval Action's launch and to see if the developers' vision truly holds to their promises.-Carr			"

Early Access Review
								I've been watching this game for awhile now but the tons of negative views kept me at bay... And that was stupid. This game is pretty great, as is evident by the tons of b****ing by people with 1,000-ish hours of playtime complaining which is generally a good sign that the underlying game is sound. The UI is rough around the edges, as is getting started. But once you move past that you're greated by a beautiful engine, fantastic physics with engaging and immersive gameplay. Waves will lift your cannons above the horizon making you miss shots, you won't pay attention to the wind and get your ship virtually stuck not moving, you'll have your main mast blown away by cannonfire... At the time of writing the player numbers are rather low as the devs are about to reset stats but it hasn't bothered me much. Still finding plenty to see and do and helpful players to talk, fight and interact with. A++ game, don't listen to the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing and moaning with hundreds of hours of playtime. There is a reason they keep coming back and are so mad, because the underlying game is pretty fantastic. tldr - 'real combat,' sweet physics; waves are real, cannon balls are real, rekt & get rekt. UI shi**y, rough around edges, but's it's an Alpha still. F**k da haters.			"

								I haven't been playing long and I'm still levelling up my characters on both the PVP and PVE servers.Although it's an early access game, Naval Action is already a great game which can only get better. The graphics are very pretty. I like the idea of having a PVE server where I can relax and learn the game without fear of being ganked. The game is a bit like Pirates of the Burning Sea with much better graphics and way better battle mechanics. All in all my money was well spent.			"

								Sandbox. Set your own objectives. Develop your playstyle. Be a pyrate, be a successful trader, design ships, engage in pvp in the open seas, or fight atop a ship of the line in epic massive battles. Simply go sailing about, at your own rhythm and enjoy all the possibilities. Naval Action in a nutshell.----------------Game is in constant development. The Game Labs crew uses a open model in which testers ( that's us ! ) discuss mechanics back and forth, present ideas and see them implemented. The Devs do take all the seemingly solid ideas and promote them into the game - sometimes they work, others not so much - but we have the chance to see our own community discussions turned into a game mechanic - Cool huh !?

								The deck pitches, the waves rock your ship, the cannons must be timed. No magic buttons to replace lost crew, no magic loads, no magic turns or repairs. You have to learn how to sail your ships, handle your sails, you have to learn how to aim and when to fire your cannons. The best game I have ever played when it comes to realism in this era. Its great fun and it will only get better.However, at this point the developers seem more interested in buffing the current content then adding the new. The battle part of the game is fully fleshed out and yet every patch they add .5% more cannon smoke or .02% sail fluff, while crafting is untouched and national strategy languishes. The game has not progressed much further then when I purchased it (4 months ago.) Open world sailing is a huge grind and a monstrous time sink without payoff. You can literally spend an hour getting where you want to go and see nothing except the rear of your ship for the duration.I love this era and was so excited that this game came out. I love the concept and the battles are its real strength, but I cannot recommend it at this point.			"

								I'll list the pros first, as I think that's fair. They are what drew me to the game originally. I will update the review if and when my opinion changes. And yeah, these things are my opinion.***Pros:1. First I will say the game has an amazing feel when you are in combat, at least in PVP. There are some things they haven't fleshed out fully, but it's still pretty interesting and the damage modeling is realistic.2. There aren't many games like this, in this genre. It has a lot of potential.3. A great alternative to a white-noise machine. Just load up resources on your trade ship, set sail on that hours-long voyage across the open blue. The sound of the wind and the rushing of your bow wave will have you nodding off in record time.***Top three cons I listed to the devs on the forum:1. Point ship in desired direction and move something in game to keep it from timing out, fight cheating AI for whatever reason, repeat, repeat repeat repeatrepeatrepeat2. Seriously after a year or so, you have done nothing but little tweaks to simple coding items. Nothing has really changed or improved with this game since OW was released.3. Basically 1 and 2... I suspect the devs are just playing a bait and switch game with ""content"" in patches. It's pretty bad when players are putting out more content (as in the ships by Ragnar) than the devs have. Might as well open the game to the players to mod... we'd have a decent game by now... with a UI that doesn't look like a half ♥♥♥♥♥ middle school computer concepts project.I already paid, so I'll probably keep watching this game, but I'm not holding my breath.***CONCLUSION: They haven't changed much about the game, and they don't seem to be really working on it. It's one of those early access games that leads people in with some juicy nugget and then keeps leading them on. It's the worst kind of tease.			"

								Naval Action is an odd creature.I've played this game for almost 250 hours and in that time I've enjoyed myself immensly, but I've also encountered many issues.The developpers spend a lot of time on balancing ships. They obviously make a bunch of mistakes or balance it the wrong way, but that's normal and in the end it always gets rectified. I've not done that much PvP but from what I've seen so far it's looking a lot better than at launch. The biggest issue here is that there's no reason to use the smaller vessels in this game. Once you unlock a larger ship, you ditch the old one. They tried rectifying this by making most port battles limited to the smaller vessels, but in the end people still play the largest ship they can when they can. It's not an easy thing to solve mind you.The graphical team have done an excellent job on the ship design. Most of the ships look very good, there's no way to argue against that. But that's where it kinda ends, which is my first issue.Other than very detailed ships there's not much else. One of the largest playerdriven events in this game hasn't been properly updated for months. When you go into a portbattle you're still fighting a couple of random towers in the middle of the ocean, and whilst an update to this was promised many months ago, we've yet to actually see any chance to that.I remember the concept art being shown for actual forts and the like, but ever since then, nothing. If you bring it up on their forums they usually don't reply to it.The cities you go to when you need to go to port are pretty much all the same and are largely a result of copy pasting. Which wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't the only thing other than ships that could make the game look and feel authentic.Another glaring issue is the user interface. It's♥♥♥♥♥♥ It's harsh but that's pretty much the essence of it. It looks really bad and is never once explained ingame. New players who buy this game, log in to the game and see the user interface are instantly turned off and who can blame them. My real question here is, why the hell has there been no attempt to even upgrade the interface. The usual response from devs and other players is: ""They're going to do that on release"". To me it's a bit of a cop out and in a game that is hemoraging players and has difficulty with player retention, small things like this are very helpful. First impressions are key, especially since you can now refund the game within the first two hours.There are other smaller issues, like the whole officer thing. They add in perks that are helpful in combat. Perks that are helpful in crafting. Perks that are helpful as a trader. Yet they only allow you to recruit and train one officer whilst it's clearly intended to allow you to have multiple officers. Why this is the case? Nobody knows.However, the thing that is the most baffling of all, is the devs reaction to critisicm and the apparent willingness to buy positive reviews from their players by promising new content if a certain amount of reviews is reached. This is why you should most certainly take any positive reviews for this game with a grain of salt. And whilst yes, you never said the reviews had to be positive, saying that: ""Positive reviews will make us work harder"" makes it obvious you meant give us positive reviews.Recently they posted a reaction to a negative review. The most striking thing that was said, was that the responses of the admins on their official forums were not always representative of company policy. But if someone with the tag 'admin' says on your forums that a feature is getting pulled because of critisicm, then it's YOUR job to make sure that employee doesn't post stupid things like that. It's always easy to, after the backlash, come out and say that he/she didn't speak for you, but the damage at that point is already done, and from my experience dealing with the devs of this game, it isn't that much of a stretch to believe the devs capable of pulling a feature because they got some critisicm.

Early Access Review
								Originally, I gave this game a huge thumbs up and highly recommended it to all who would listen. What was an amazing game with a lot of potential is turning into a lame duck. Combat is taking a serious turn for the worse as they are trying to move toward a more 'historic' approach to naval battle which seriously reduces the amount of damage done to enemies. No longer can you do damage at 200 meters or further from ships. Group pvp is now more of solo-within-group pvp as you can only have so many people within 200 yards of enemy ships with an angle to penetrate. Battles which were once exciting and skill-based are turning into hours-long snoozefests where you literally have to be almost on top of another ship to damage them. While they may tweak this to (I'm sure they will?) reflect the desire of the player base as a whole, it is indicative of the attitude of the developers. It is obvious that they are making the game that they want to make, regardless of the appeal to the larger gaming community in general or in regard to the opinion of those who they allowed to PAY to test and give feedback. Boarding combat is extremely uninteresting and detracts from the game. It is basically a PC version of rock/paper/scissors. All the suspense of childrens game with the graphics to match. The ship cannon combat graphics are awesome, but the boarding graphics don't even have crew representations, it is literally a text screen/overlay that pops up and reports the results of the 'hidden' boarding battle.  Some ships have a numerical crew (listed in your HUD) of up to 1200+, but when you board it shows an empty deck while the battle 'rages' in text.Since the steam release the in-port UI screen has literally been a blue screen with absolutely no graphics. It is about as close to a MUDD based game as you can get and has been that way for the last 3 1/2 months. Instead of taking the time to remedy such an obvious blemish to the game that they are charging $40 for, they are more interested in breaking things that are already working well, such as the combat system.Finally, the game is a serious time sink that doesn't allow you to just log on for 30 or 45 minutes and accomplish something. You literally need to commit to 2 or 3 hours to really have an opportunity to enjoy yourself. Out of those 2 or 3 hours half of that time will be you sailing around waiting for the fun to happen. Speaking of mind-numbing, the time it takes to sail in between ports is fantastically slow. I have watched butter melt that was more interesting. For someone with ADD/ADHD, this game could possibly be used as a torture device. Handcuff them to a computer desk and make them 'explore' in a 'historical' sense. The developers are choosing to ignore testers (who paid to help test their game) for voicing opinions in an attempt (most of the time) to help shape this game. Well, I was a believer and advocate for this game, not so anymore. They seem to only want to listen to those individuals who give them the answers they are looking for, essentially the 'yes men.'

								It's a great game!Pro's1. The most realistic 17th -18th century naval warfare you will find.  2. Graphics are extremely good.3. Long travel times!  This can be a turn off, but for me, it filters out the in patients kids from the game.  If you are willing to sail for an hour just to get a location, that means you are patient and determined and that's who I want to play with.  3. Wide range of ships.  Again, they all look fantastic.4. Not even close to being finished yet and it's still a very playable game.Con's.1. It's an alpha game, not even close to being done.   If you want a finished game wait for release.This is more like a simulator.  Which is exactly why I love it!Do not take away the long travel times please!			"

								Pretty good for an early access game, although it has been in alpha 1 year prior to this early access release.Nonetheless, pretty amazing for an open world game. The grinding has been all over though, the UI is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥but the gameplay is where it stands at its best. You could actually feel the quality over quantity on the ship battles, because numerous times I have had for example 5 more basic cutters (first ship) than the other team, but gets destroyed by a 3rd rate. That just tells you how powerful the expensive and big ships really are, it's quite scary to face one of these in small or large battles.This game has port battles which I haven't come through yet because of me ranking incredibly slowly in 80 hours. You'd probably not spend as much time to get up in rank, but for me it's been a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥So in conclusion, if you have a lot of spare time you could try play this game, especially if you are interested in naval warfare. I am saying this again, the grinding is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

								Well... I thought I heard the old man say, ""Leave her Johnny. Leave her. It's a long hard pull to the next payday... unless you find compass wood."" It's still in early access and looks great aside from the menus. Game play is pretty good. The only thing I dislike is how hard it is to get gold... almost like they went out of their way to make gild gain as realistic as they could... even though I dislike it, it's makes capturing ships a lot more worth while. I suggest assembling a Playlist of songs like those from AC Black Flag. Also play anything but pirates unless you enjoy watching your faction drown in power struggles.			"

								Its a great and ""realistic"" naval simulator. Its a bit complex at the start, but as you get common on the contols its very good.But ! It lacks loads of other things.  The bording of other ships is tedius and more like a game of dice. Why not FPS ?The crew animations are so simple, i wanna see men manning the pump, and pump like hell.  More action on the deck !The texture of the crew is bad, looks like people working ia office. There are no grafics in control scenes when i habour.Things who helps create the mood of the time, and the game. Personal advatars is not present. Customizing your ship and sails, not present. For the pice i atleast expected a few of these things.The game itself in an open world is a slow grinding thing, it takes ages to get XP and climp in rank to be able to command bigger ships . ..  I mean ages and in the long run it will be boring considering you might loose your hard earned ship in a sec ! Making money is a bit more easy but still requires a load of missions or trading.If your a hardcore 18 century naval fan then you will like it, if not you will be bored in the long run of the games current state.

								11/10For a game thats still in Alpha its superb.  Has very playable content with VERY few bugs.  Its immersing and fun, but most importantly its CHALLENGING!  Some people argue that its empty in terms of content and a 'grindy' game which is true  (hello?  Still in alpha!) but personally I don't mind the grind at all as every battle there is a good chance you will sink if fighting a bigger ship or even 2v1!  You can group up with friends or randoms and battle against large AI fleets that cruise the waters and have epic scale fights, or have a chill and do some trading and crafting.Not for the type of gamers who want to blow everything up and own at battles within 15 mins.  Takes a long time to master the mechanics or sailing and aiming effectively and each time you advance in rank and get a new ship you have to re-adjust your skills to fit the new speed/turn/gun placements.  The detail they have put into combat is fantastic, and you have to pay attention to a lot of factors to stay ahead of the enemy to win.  and for such an early game combat looks fab!If you liked cids pirates and such you'll love this game!

								Great game!  I looked and studied and pondered for a couple of weeks before I bought it.  I've had it for 36 hours and have logged 13 hours in game.  Not having a manual makes for some interesting oopses on my part, but I'm getting the hang of it, and it's a lot more satisfying to learn things the hard way.  So far, I've only played on the PVE server, but when I level up, I'll give PVP a try.Don't wait, buy it NOW.			"

								I have only been playing this for a few hours so far, and it's still early access = many bugsbut so far this game seems to be what i have dreamt of for a long time. Yes battles are slow and tend to be very time consuming. its tough to navigate the open sea. but that just seem to work for this game, it requires alot of thinking, and you have to pay attention to everything you pass to have any idea where you are. wind makes for alot of chalenges too, both in and out of battles. the cannons arent particularly accurate ( pretty hard to hit anything unless you get very close ) and it all just works to make this game fun, interesting and challenging and so much more than the standard arcade like games we usually see these days. so far i am excited to see where this game is going, and i hope you all try it and give it some real time before you make up your mind about it.Good luck and fair seas			"

								Still in development, so there are inbalances and many changes. That said, it's the most beautiful game I have ever played, with a well developed battle mechanic that does a good job representing combat in the age of sail. The game takes time to play, there's not much you can accomplish in 30 minutes for example, but is extreamly satisfying. Join a clan and coordinate your efforts to get the most out of it.			"

								Fans of economic PVP games or Caribbean pirates alike will both get their kicks in this game.  Bear in mind it is still in early access, but if you're a fan of EVE Online or Pirates of the Burning Sea, you should get excited about the potential.  The combat simulation is deep enough to keep you coming back for more, with PVP being about more than mashing skills but also, positioning relative to target and wind, and proper target ranging.  Economic elements of the game include building and stocking your storehouse with resources to build your fleet, with the higher tiered ships being guild-wide undertakings that must be protected at risk of losing days/weeks of hard work if it is destroyed, (yes ships can be perma-destroyed).  Starting price tag may seem steep for an EA game i'll agree, but if you're the niche player of the target audience, its money well spent for a good time.			"

								Hello! I am a guy that is fan of the age of sail and bought this game today. I think many people like pro/cons lists so here:PRO'S:- Realistic combat- Beautiful designed ships- Good trade system- Can play with friends- Huge ship battles - Many upgrades- Open worldCON'S- Traveling is to long and boring- When traveling in open waters, you encounter almost no ships- Ugly town UI(just blue screen with options)- No crew visible when traveling(minor con)- Boarding in combat is a blue screen with crew members decreasing instead of seeing your crew members fight- Crew members will do the gun load animation the whole battle wich takes away realism- No single difference between factions except for different starting place- Little ship viarity- Low amount of servers- Before entering combat, you get a loading screen(takes away the open world a bit)- Pogression is slow- When you start out, you feel uneeded and weak- Not much team communication within battles- The almost triple A asking price(EDIT, extra con)- No tutorial for new players to get them started.Well, i know this is early acces so i hope it will become worth its asking price at one point but right now its just thievery. I think the price for a MMO like this should be max $20. I think the asking price turns many people away and leaves the world even more empty. There are to little features and there is few things to do. It gives almost no sandbox feel and you only see its an MMO if you come close to city's wich are usually full of new players(wich is also the reason why there is almost no ship viarity being that every new player starts out with the same ship!).I have my refund requested. I tried to get into it but i can't. I if you were looking for a open world sandbox game set in the age of sail, buy sid meiers pirates. great game and 3,7 times cheaper.Sorry but i am not putting 100+ hours in a game that doesn't spark 1 single thought of enjoyment.

								First and foremost, this game has so very much potential and is excitingly unique.  I feel terrible not recommending it.  For me though, it was totally let down by the almost incomprehensible (and startling ugly) menu screens.  It seems like so much work has gone into the rest of this game, and the menu screens have been added almost as an afterthought.  I have requested a refund, as none of the screenshots show these, and I don't feel they are representative of the game as it stands, and people should be made aware of this before being expected to part with the price of a far more developed game.  (I question whether one can call themselves indie, and charge the same as many of the large developers.)  That said, I have to emphasise that I love where the developers are going with this, and I will definitely be buying another copy if/when the menu system becomes a bit more comprehensible.  And perhaps add even the smallest tutorial?			"

								Devs are a disgrace, I had high hopes for this game and am bitterly disappointed at the way it's turned out. Somewhere along the line I feel they lost the desire to develop the most requested aspects of the title and blagged the community that ""bug fixes and tweaks"" are new content (this is what they passed up pirate specific mechanics, actual ports in port battles, trading XP and much more for). Nothing substantial added to the game for months, community ""interaction"" is generally a vocal minority of players on their forums bowing and scraping to the developers while constructive criticism is ignored and reviled at every turn by these players and most shockingly the developer. Also keep in mind this game is due for release in a matter of months, after almost a year of nothing but bug fixes and tweaks if miraculously they do manage to implement the most requested features, how long until they'll really be playable? If ever? The development plan ends at release.Negative Steam reviews are also being flagged by the developer as a means to hide fair criticism of the game and prevent posters from editing their review. Read this review, it'll explain the situation in much more detail with concrete evidence to back it up: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991377081/recommended/311310/FOR THE PEOPLE CALLING OUT ""LIES"" IN OTHER REVIEWS, THOSE WHO ARE DENYING PREMIUM OR EXCLUSIVE SHIPS FOR TESTERS: http://i.imgur.com/UB3iSTa.pngOr is this just a ""misinterpretation"" or ""twisting"" of words as you've accused others of doing?

								Dear Players, interested players,I've read a lot bad reviews here which I mostly can not understand. Those reviews were written rashly and mostly without knowing the available given informations which those players actualy should know. Please ignore them!Thus I kinda feel forced to give my feedback of the game:But before a little warning: This game is not a game for players which want to achieve something easy! It is not for landlubbers but for captains.Personal:I've started to play the game active at febuary and know I've played the game around 700h. I loved every single hour I spend on this game - Sure sometimes it wasnt the best way the game evolved but overall I wouldnt want to miss it and would also do this again if I had to.Now to the feedback: As every player should know, early acces games are not fully developed as a normal game. This game still is not released, hence we get new stuff almost monthly if possible. That also means, that sometimes the game itselfes changes (E.g: The trading system constandly evolves). So of course, it could happen that you might missjudge the market (and loose some gold ingame) or that you can win a lot through speculation. Trading belongs a open world game like crafting should. (Ayou need better ships? Than you have to build them!)But this game is not mainly a trading game, it is an open world sail-battle game with wonderful and detailed coastlines and ships. You have to pay attention to the wind direction and a lot other stuffs. This game wants to present you the most detail and most wonderful playing experience within the 18th century on sailing ships. Thus it is pretty hard to understand especially cause there is no real ""tutorial"" to get the basics, still it is worth it and hell yeah, it makes a lot of fun!Hope I see ya on the seas captains! Faithfully yours,Twig			"

								The developers have created a graphically beautiful world with complex combat mechanics that approach realistic big ship sailing and age of sail battle better than any I have seen. The potential is there for a rich player experience. However, one should realize before purchasing at this Early Access stage that it is currently more potential than reality. Don’t get me wrong: you can have a lot of fun playing Naval Action when in battle. However, most of the peaceful activities such as trading and crafting can be more of a drudgery than a joy. That could change though. THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME. That means that mechanics, rules, and even some basic paradigms of the game are changing. Many players don’t think they are changing fast enough. Others hate the changes and want things left as they were.One of the biggest impediments right now is just low player population. As Naval Action gets closer to release or after release, hopefully the population will get higher. Many problems with the game are a direct result of not enough players around the world to make PVP action readily available, to fill player battles, and to truly test a player run economy.If you’re the type of player who wants instant shooting action, this game will probably never be for you. If you are primarily interested in PVE play, it may never be for you as well since the developer’s stated priority is PVP play. While PVE is available right now, it is unclear how much development time it will get in the future to make it a richer experience. If you are the type of person that after dedicating time in a game which is in testing and development you’ll get all huffy when things change or when a wipe is necessary, you should probably wait until release. We’re testing here. However, if you are interested in this period of history and want to literally experience the fun and pain of a New World, you should give Naval Action a try. "

								A fun game to play, however the mods on the forum are petty and vindictive while the developers insist on making players compete in tournements they set up in order to get the best gear.Not for the casual gamer or players without lots of time to grind thru the tournements. Because without the best gear, sadly you become fodder for those who do have it. Ganking is rampant, there are no checks on gankers at all.Game is broken right now - some players have OP gear most do not.			"

Early Access Review
								I nearly wrote a really long review but after 2 pages and still not being done I decided that that was too long (I might still post it at some point). Sadly the development took a turn for the worst and what once was a really enjoyable game turned into a wasted opportunity. While the community has been this games biggest asset and biggest bane at the same time all the time the devs originally seperated these things quite well and chose updates wisely. This is no logner the case. Not only does a vocal minority that shouts a lot currently destroy the game from the communtiy side but the devs have taken to introducing one update after another that simply lacks support across the entire board with nobody understanding why it is happening. In fact at this point the question whether we are testing NA 2 isn't even that far fetched considering the devs no longer try to implement a feature and refine it but jsut randomly test features for a month or two and then completely replace it as if going through complete development options instead of a clear path.Sadly however this is not the only problem - the devs have lost their rags to be frank. Any form of criticism is lately either being taken personal, attempted to censor or just ignored leaving the entire testing premise flawed and useless.One more warning sadly also needs to be said. The palyerbase which wasn't well distributed has now reached such a low point that you would be buying more into a single player experience with chat then an actual multiplayer. This has been made worse by the fact that the servers are going to be split which will effectively leave either one server barely alive and the other one dead or both completely on their last leg.So in the end - do not buy this game! As much fun as it ocne was it no longer as and the way the devs are conducting their business can no longer be supported!!! Bans and censorship are now at a point where I actually ended up reporting the game to steam...Little note: Due to the way things have been kicking off lately on the forums and in the comments section I will not allow any comments under my review whether good or bad and delete them all!!! Whether you like that or not use the thumbs system to show me what you think thats what it is there for!			"

Early Access Review
								Awesome game! I will expand this review weekly in the comments below: Day one: The world is massive, truly massive. Sailing is fairly easy if you understand the mechanics of tacking. If not, it's easy to get the hang of it. You start out with zero gold, but it's not a problem. You can gain gold easy by doing missions where you go out and fight pirates. Once you accept a mission, you look at your map and a crossed sword appears somewhere at sea close to the port you accepted the mission from. Exit the port and use your compass to get a general bearing, because you can get lost if it's out of sight of land. The fights are not click fests, so fast twitch COD type players may get bored. Strategic players will LOVE it! You have to use the wind to your advantage, change your cannon shot according to your plans which change constantly due to the ebb and flow of battle. I like to use chain to damage the enemy's sails at first from a distance while avoiding his broadsides if possible, then I maneuver behind his stern and use ball shot to damage his stern. Once his stern is damaged, I switch to grape shot and take out his crew. It's not just point and click however. When you use grape shot you need to time the waves so the boat is leaning towards you and you can actually see the crew for better results. It can actually make the difference between killing 2 crew members or 12! You can also try to demast or reduce his sails to where his speed is very low and then board the ship. If successful, you get to keep the ship and everything in the hold!!! Battles are not fast. Sometimes it takes over an hour for me to kill a pirate. I'm told that as you get better it gets quicker, but it's still a lot of fun and quite realistic even for a rookie like me and I usually stink at killing anything in PVP or even PVE type situations.  Awesomeness!!!     Getting on to other aspects of my first weekend. Travel and exploration is quite realistic. There is no gps and your position is not marked on the map. At first I hated this, but now I love it. It's realistic. The ocean is vast. You can get lost easy. At first I just sailed in the general direction of an island with a port I wanted to locate to see what trading goods they needed. Big mistake. The island was quite far and I got lost. I spent two real life hours in open sea with no sight of land anywhere. I finally ran into a small island which was well of course of where I thought I was headed. Since then, I've found that the best way to travel and not get lost is to open up your map, pick the location you want, and zoom in. You can then see the coordinates. Start your journey in the general direction using your compass and check your coordinates on the map occasionally, adjusting your direction based on your current coordinates. It's very simple. If the first number on your coordinate target is say 75:00 N  15:10 W and you're at 78:00 N  17:00 W, go in the direction that makes the first number go lower, then adjust your steering to the left or right to make the second number go lower. Keep adjusting untill the numbers match and you'll find your destination. You'll actually see it before the numbers match especially if you use your spyglass by using the ""Shift"" key. I haven't gotten lost since I started using this method.     The world map encompasses the entire Gulf of Mexico, the eastern seaboard of the United states, South America, and the Bahamas, Cuba, etc. It'a absolutely huge and would take hours and hours to get from one end to another. Ports are controlled by various countries, each with certain advantages. I chose England because there were a lot of players choosing that country due to it's rich naval history. You can take ports from other countries, but I haven't tried that yet.     As you discover ports, it reveals what they produce and what they consume as far as resources like Oak, Iron, tea, hemp, etc. If you like to trade, you can open trade routes. Buy stuff cheap at one port and sell it higher at another. I just started trying this and it seems like a lot of fun, but the market is very competitive.      Crafting seems awesome as well. You can actually craft your own ships!!! And best of all, they can vary in terms of quality so you and your friend may craft the same boat but one might be significantly better than the other! The only drawback to crafting that I see so far is that it uses something called labor hours and you're limited to so many a day. You can also add outposts in ports you like and then construct buildings like silver mines, oak forests, etc and harvest your own resources, but these too use up labor hours. So unlimited crafting is not an option although I believe that perhaps you can purchase labor hours form other players. I'm not sure on this because I haven't crafted much yet, but i see people shouting out they have it for sale. It still looks like crafting will be a blast on a limited basis of course.       You can also fish, and actually catch fish while you're traveling, but the market for most of the fish is not very profitable. One exception is Bull Sharks. They go for 5000 to 10000 gold and I caught three on my first day. Species of fish vary according to your location. I caught the Bull sharks as I sailed closer to the Florida coast.        You can upgrade your ships and buy new ones and there are a lot to choose from. You must rank up to get better ships. I've ranked up once already, but I haven't purchased a new ship yet because I liike my cutter and I'm not sure which ship I want to buy yet.You can also build a fleet of ships which makes fighting much easier at the cost of lower experience gain.      There are guilds you can join so you can declare war on other nations. I haven't joined one yet, because I'm still trying to learn the game and there is a lot to learn. There is a chat function with a few channels like nation, global, help, etc. You can friend people in game.      The game is early access, but gets regualar updates. The potential here is amazing. The sea is beautiful to sail upon. There are weather effects. I'm hoping they incorporate hurricanes! There is no tutorial yet, so I use Youtube and google to learn stuff and the help chat in game. I've played a lot this first weekend and even though I still don;t know what I'm doing in many aspects, I love it.      One of my favorite moments was when I was lost at sea for two hours. I had not seen a single ship or even a hint of land as I traveled fishing along the way. I kept catching new species of fish. Suddenly, in the distance I saw a large ship. My heart started pounding as I clicked on him to see his nationality. He was English like me! It was an amazing feeling. I felt as if I had truly been lost and not just in a game. I realized that unless he was lost like me, he had to be coming from somewhere, so I followed his course backwards while he disappeared im my wake. Eventually I came upon a small English port on an island. I could easily have clicked on him and chatted asking him where the nearest land was since I had not learned to use my map yet, but I wanted to do it on my own and eventually I succeeded. This is one of the things that make this game pure Awesomeness for me. Not knowing if an enemy might be lying in wait for you over the horizon. Coming up on an unknown port in the dark and barely being able to see the lights of a few buildings in your spyglass, but realizing that at least it's land. The sense of relief when you see that it belongs to your home country or an ally....the dread when you see that it belongs to an enemy and you change course before someone sees you . You set your sails to take advantage of the most favorable wind and escape sailing out into the unknown....Day 2: Today I started crafting parts for a ship I'm going to build. In order to build a ship you must make an outpost at a port, then build a shipyard. The shipyard is expensive...50,000 gold			"

								This game can be a really good game for those that want a real Sail Age naval battles ""simulator"", it has a very good potential.But!1-The developers are only taking care of what the english speakers say2-The exploits are being forgiven when they are used by the biggest community of the game, Birtian and their allies.3-The fair gameplay and honorable behaviour is being substitute by ""who is the smartest using the exploits"".4-There is not any kind of system to encourage a balance between nations. There are nations with 10 players per each player of another nation. 5-There is a port timers system that let players from some places of the world to attack other ports while their ports are almost save (who is going to be between 2-8am fighting PB?)6-The game is being driven to a ""spend 100hours a day playing/navigating or you have nothing""And so on...I will revise my review after the following patch if and only if the devs try to fix those issues and the rest pointed out in the forums.

								For an extremely complex game(upgrades, ships, battles, trading), there is no tutorials or information about anything. The open world is cool though. I like how the wind actually matters with the sails. But once again, there is nothing telling you about the controls. Grinding might be easier if I knew what to do. How does the trade system work? How does battle system work? How does the upgrade system work? How does the ship equipments work? I don't know any of these things, yet they are needed to play the game.  I don't like to give games bad reviews, but this game is not worth $39 I paid. I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.			"

								Naval action is a very beatifull game both in the open world and in Battles,  I have have enjoyed many hours of ingame time.  Note, that for the beginner it has a steep learning curve, so dont get discouraged two quickly.   If your having trouble, Naval actions has a player base with some of the nicest  individuals you could find.  Way better than any other game I have ever tried, so just ask them questions in the Help channel.  Also note that as the game is still in developement, it does  have a few bugs at times and doesn't have all of the spit and polish finished yet, but I have no dought that when completed, it will be epic.  Naval action is well worth playing for eny person that loves the age of sail and wants to immerse themselves in it.			"

Early Access Review
								This game is no longer worth the time or money it costs to play it, in fact, it is overpriced garbage. It is advertised as an MMO with many different features to keep you interested, and at this point I dare say it is falsely advertised. In the early days of EA resources were scarce and crafting was a challenge. You had to compete with other players for limited resources and not everyone could craft a ship every day. This also gave incentives for your nation to expand and take the ports of others in order to give your nation access to more resources. I enjoyed the competition and enjoyed nice ships being a rarity. The developers have since catered to care bears who only want an easy mode game, and as a result there isn’t really anything left to do. Resources are now in infinite supply. There is no point to capturing the ports of other nations for their resources. You will find everything you will ever need in an infinite supply in the ports right next to your capital. The developers plan on wiping many aspects of player accounts due to the influx of cheaters. They have said they will soft wipe the servers, which means players will lose all of their gold, ships, and resources. They do not plan on wiping XP or crafting level. This won’t slow down a cheater who by definition isn’t playing by the rules; instead it will punish the average player. Sounds fun doesn’t it?The one thing this game does decently is the combat. There is some fun to be had in pvp. This alone may keep you interested for a couple of days but it too will become monotonous and boring quite fast. When I started playing there were enough players to be spread around 2 to 3 different servers. At the time of this review there is only enough players left to fill half of one server, and it's easy to see why players are leaving this game in droves. I give this game a 3/10 and would say its worth about $10.00.			"

								I'd like to start by saying this is a niche game and still in development. if you are looking for an assassin's creed pirate gameplay experience then... walk away. If you are looking for more realism and tactics with a mmo aspect to the game then you might have a winner!Naval battles: let's start with that as it is focused on the golden age of sails 17/18th centuries. they are awesome...You have access to many ships as you level up in the game. Some are fast and manoeuvrable other strong with great fire power. Each ship has a purpose (hunter/scout/ fire power platform etc.) They all have advantages and drawbacks, it is up to you to focus on the good aspect and play accordingly to get the most of your ship! Playing with others in different ships will allow you to build tactics to win an engament.PvP can be very intense but beware of ganking not so fun^^ so open your eyes while sailing in open world.The graphics are nice and the ambient sound during battle are immersive.Crafting and trading are available. i'm not going to lie.. it's a long process and it takes time. But if you are into that it works well. To sum up, you need ressources to build ship parts that will ultimatly be used to build your ship. Ressources can be bought or produce in ports and every ports produces specific ressources. So you will have to sail a lot to gather the much needed ressources to craft. If you can't craft well trade for what you need by sending contacts in ports.The open world: it's huuuge! it encompass the south of the USA, the mexican gulf, cental america and the north of bresil (and all islands in between). sailing to one point to the far opposite point of the map will take hours!! fortunatly you can open ports docks to fast ""warp"" your captain from one area to another (without the ship). Each area is controlled by a kingdom you can choose from when starting the game (GB, USA, Spain, France, Deutch, Sweden, Danemark and the Pirates)Kingdom vs Kingdom: As said earlier on, the game has a mmo part in it. it is represented by nation fighting each other over control of ports.  Going to war (or allying) is acheived by a round of vote inside the nation. Once the votes are closed well, you know who is going to fight you. To capture an area, you need to flip the targetted area by increasing the hostility level in this area. This can be acheived by PvP and  PvE mission. Once the region is ""flipped"" a porty battle is open (46hours after the flip). This is the occasion to have a 25v25 players fight! (very intense). Nations will organise to attack or defend. This can bring epic battles.Capturing an area has a strategic value as ports produce ressources needed for the craft of your ship. It also gives different bonuses to your ship.Regarding the UI, it is indeed a basic Unity menu but it doesnot hurt the game mechanics nor the pleasure of sailing. Moreover it is the last step you take in game development. Why spending hours of work in a UI you will have to change constantly as the game evole (The UI will be released  before launch. and that the intelligent thing to do).,As a beginner,  you might get a bit lost starting as there is no guide provided. But a quick google search will give you access to many player's guide and ""how to"" explaining the basics.Regarding the play time needed to evolve (carft / make money etc..) well this game has a MMO aspect to it so yeah it takes time. This is why the game is best played within the comfort of a clan/guild or with friends. As you can centralise and put your effort together to gather ressources and craft ship. Crafting in this game imply that you organize yourself with other to reach your goal. if you can't produce a ressource, trade for it, find people providing the goods, many people do that. Making money is very easy and can be obtain by doing mission or trading goods between port. Furthermore it is always fun to hunt enemies with group of swashbuckling lads!To suml up: It is a slow pace game, beautifully designed (very stable for a beta) The game is still in devlopment and the devs are making changes and are tweaking it but imo they are going into the right direction.

								Pros:- Very in-depth combat system with detailed damage model and sailing behavior- Beautiful graphics- huge open world map of the carribbean- Weather effects- Active and smart devs. Can't overstate this. Very thoughtful and consistent approach to the development process. Mechanics and content changes are quite frequent and are published in advance. Feels much more positive and responsive than POTBS dev team years backCons:- RvR, ROE, economy need more depth. Basic system works but feels like a placeholder until some focused development in that area happens- textbox UI doesn't help with immersion- definitely not a ready product. expect changes, wipes and other frustrations- expensiveOverall if you're a mature, patient gamer, tall ship fan, ready to see the game grow with you - a must have. No better naval game on the market.If you're hardcore player, competitive, looking to win at all costs - don't buy. There are cheaper titles that reward this play style better. And the game mechanics feel a little shaky and probably not too hard to exploit at the moment.			"

								This game will grab your attention and not let go!Yes, it is ""just"" early access. Yes, a lot of work still needs to be done. When you first log in, the menus might put you off a little. They are functional, but ugly. Once you set sail however..... wow. Just wow. The ships, oceans and shorelines look stunning. Some days you sail on a calm sea under a hot bright sun, other days you will find yourself in a wicked storm that limits your visibility and slows you down. Rain and thunder roll over you and your ship heaves over the waves.Combat is amazing as well. It takes skill to maneuver your ships around, especially in the massive port battles! Those usually start out with the two opposing sides forming tactical lines, but halfway through the battle you will find yourself amongst a boiling mass of angry cannons, thick smoke and breaking masts. Ever seen one of those old paintings depicting an age-of-sail naval battle? It's like that. Exactly like that.Also; the community is great. (And please; if you decide to buy this game, keep it like that!) The game is not for the faint of heart. You have to navigate around the map yourself (no TomTom in this game), and because there's no manual or other documentation yet it can be hard at first to understand everything. That's part of an Early Access release. But the community is there to help and it does a splendid job. Never before have I been brought up to speed in a game so quickly with the (freely offered) help of others!And last but not least; the dev-team is great. They keep the players up-to-date through the forums on a very regular basis. They say what they're going to do and they do what they say. Player suggestions, complaints and requests are answered and taken into development whenever possible. Amazing work for such a (relatively) small team of developers.If you love movies like ""Master and Commander"", enjoy the ship-battles in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" or enjoy watching age-of-sail documentaries about battles like Trafalgar, Chatham or the lives pirates really lived in the 17-1800's, then this is the game for you. Remember; it's early access. Not everything is completed and you'll have to climb a bit of a learning curve, but it is well worth it!			"

								Naval Action is a beautiful naval combat game with a lot of potential.It's still in EA at the time I'm posting this review, but It's already a very strong game.The graphics are amazing, so make sure to have some proper hardware if you wish to max out the settings in this game.(i5 and GTX 960 / 970 should be enough for 1080p)Currently the player base is very small, due to slow paced development.Having a team / clan is key in this game. Playing alone is very hard but possible.Since it's still EA, game mechanics are constantly being improved or even changed.Probably the two most important assets in this game are:-a lot of players in one nation-their skills and coordination in battles Highest player count was somewhere near 2400 and there were a lot of battles and fights at that time.I could only imagine what would happen if there would be 20000 players online.Is it worth buying at this moment? To be honest, I don't know. It's probably the best to buy the game when it's fully released.			"

								I love the concept of this game.  So much so I didn't mind spending $40 to get a chance to play.  However,  the required grinding to advance is beyound stupid!!!!!  Unless you have 10 to 12 hours a day for the rest of your life don't bother to get this game.  It's current state while entertaining for the first 20 to 30 hours becomes a boreing repeat of the same thing over and over anad over!  Did I mention the gridding and the hours of dead time going from point A to B?  Unless your willing to grid for literally days to advance one level, then don't bother with the game in it's current state.  Wait and see.  Currently it's worth 5 to 10 dollars, not a penny more!

								The combat is great, ship design is good. It's a bit too grindy and sometimes repetitive.Port battles are dull, underdeveloped and lack proper balance. Port timers encourage factions to screw the enemy by setting odd-hour times and there's no player number balance between factions (There are two big zerg nations and everyone else is screwed) The long travel times aren't for everyone.Updated As of 29 of may: The devs have completely broken ship armor and cannon penetration, some ships won't even take damage even from 42 pounder cannons SHOOTING IN PARALLEL (Ships of the line only and 4th rates) PVP is not fun right now, and unless these changes are reverted or balanced don't even bother.

								First, i wanna tell that this game is great as a sim but it sucks at every other stages.- Naval combat is amaizing (And really difficult to master for a random player, you'll always be weaker than the IA)- IA's are TOTALY CHEATED AND OVERPOWERED, THEY NEVER MISS ANY SHOT (AI are ALWAYS STRONGER than players)- HARDCORE MECHANICS (Naval mechanics, with sailling, reloading)- Useless OPENWORLD (It's empty with NOTHING TO DO IN), except searching battles, but it's useless to do battles, because the AI will ♥♥♥♥ you- Game is too expensive for the lack of content you get (For 40 bucks, you can get 2 good games that are really really far ahead as OPENWORLD SANDBOX, like Life is Feudal or even ARK:Survival Evolved <== Go download big galleons mod and you got Naval Action)- No trading (It's useless to make money in this game, because you need to farm the missions to get XP and improve your rank, if you don't have the specified rank, you can't get BIG SHIPS like the well known VICTORY) ==> And it's REALLY LONG (I needed 70 hours only to get the 6 rank, and there is 10 ranks in total, the VICTORY NEED THE 9th RANK)- Stupid and boring grind (Sorry but, i already païd 40 ♥♥♥♥in euro to play, just give us the big ships, please)- Stubborn and stupid dev's, doesn't listen the community (Everybody asked to lower the AI difficulty, but they upgraded it to make them EVEN MORE difficult) ==> Dev's are clearly saying : ♥♥♥♥ THE PLAYERS !!- SUDDEN WIPES THAT MAKEs YOU LOSE EVERYTHING YOU WORKED FOR (I played 70 hours for nothing).CONCLUSION : Its one of the most shitiest game i ever played !! Don't play it or you'll get cancer and ♥♥♥♥in' die !!			"

								If you have ever wanted to feel like the captain of an Age of Sail ship this game is your chance.You can command any vessel starting from small cutters and yachts up to huge Ships of the Line. You can trade, sail the seas, fight enemy ships and conquer enemy towns for the benefit of you nation and your own.Here is a short list of my most favorite features of the game: - Extremely realistic sail mechanics. - A map on which you have to find out yourself where you are (no GPS). - Beautyful sea, weather and world. Just sail and admire the sunsets. - Advanced damage model with leaks, demasting, fires and explosions. - Trading goods between towns and crafting ships. - Huge naval battles with up to 25 versus 25 players in beautyful ships.If you do remember Pirates and liked it, this is the perfect game for you.If you want to see some more you can stop by at www.twitch.tv/PlakRocks or www.youtube.com/c/PlakRocks to watch some move videos of this great game.

								Amazing game all around. I will be sailing around in the open world and just look around me and I see the beautiful scenery that the devs have put so much work into. I go into a battle and I truly feel like the captain of a ship, just as I did in my youth. I sail about, seeking adventure, wealth, and most of all, filthy pirates.From a technical standpoint, the game is indeed an alpha, but it's quite well polished, and bugs are rare. The developers are amazing from all that I have seen, and are very receptive to the community's thoughts. There are features that need tweaking and some that have yet to be added, but I am confident in gamelabs. The loading screen quotes are also very witty and fun, just to mention that.Overall, if you have any interest in the age of sail and becoming a captain, this game is certainly for you.			"

								Greetings,I have been gaming for quite some time, since early nineties, and I have to admit that this game surprised me a lot in a very possitive way. This game is a true masterpiece and for me it is among the best games which were ever created. It's just awesome. I admire attention to details the most, for it's more or less a simulator of age of sail warfare. I like the community on PvP EU which is great, some hardcore, some casual, all sorts of players.Though the anti dev people have some valid points, please remember that the game is still in development. I don't focus on the fraction of the work which is still tuned, but instead I appreciate the 99 percent of the work which was done right by the devs. They do a tremendous job on the title. Thumbs up for courage to program such non-mainstream title. If you like age of sail just go get it.			"

								I love the game. Graphics are beautiful and the naval combat is spot on but what makes this game great is the community. Everyone is extreamly helpful and will go out of their way to help you progress. Proabably one of the best gaming communities I've ever seen. My only complaint is the lack of content and stuff todo while sailing. I feel like I spend too much of the gameplay walking away from my computer and back at 15 minute intervals because it takes so long to get anywhere. I have limited time to play games and alot of times I don't feel like spending 45 mins + just looking around at empty ocean on my way somewhere. Thats about my only complaint. I've enjoyed all other aspects of the game so far and look forward to whats coming.			"

Super helpful community with some really nice people.This is my first MMO and I am loving it.

								This game brings me back to the days of Sid Meier's Pirates. It has the feel of combat coming from Black Flag, and the likes of naval battles found in the Total War seires. I've only had 10 hours in the game and haven't really left my small area near my starting port yet It has kept me enthralled. It is a game of patience at some times when it comes to travel due to the size of the world yet this smooth sailing I don't find dull but more of a nice break after battle. Of course if you want non stop battle you still have that ability. So far great game no bugs seen. Can't wait to see what is added.			"

								This game could definitely use some quality of life enhancmenets, especially when it comes to navigation. I know it's a sim, but it should also be fun. Right now it's fun for only the extremely niche hardcore and nobody else. This is why the game is getting negative reviews, people expect an enjoyable experience and this tips over toward being a bit too hardcore and a little too time consuming to do stuff in. I kinda like the game just for sitting around and sailing and stuff but I have to say the game overall is just not very fun as it is right now. And I mean, I played EvE for years, so PVP is something I enjoy, and I don't mind getting my ships wrecked. So that def isn't my issue. The game just isnt very playable to the average gamer who wants to have fun.That being said, this game has TONS of potential, and is only in Alpha, there is plenty of time to improve the game and make it more accessible. Right now the game is ""playable"" but I wouldn't recommend it in this state.			"

								A beautiful sailing game, based on the unity engine.I've played this game in the closed early access for some time now, and it's finally out on Steam. What you can expect from this game? A realistic sailing simulator, with pretty ships during the age of sail, tons of fun playing multiplayer. It's really exciting to be in a big naval battle, line formation, giving the ships of the line their name, just  firing upon the other fleet, watching the smoke build up more and more as the battle goes on. The sounds of the cannons echoing over the ocean, and then the cracking and splintering of wood as the cannons impact the hull of the ship, with little pieces flying all over and landing in the water.Apart from that, there is also the open world, which allows trading, exploring, sinking pirates, the usual stuff one would expect from a naval open world game. The time is sped up in the open world, but the travelling time is somewhat realistic, with the carribean area being very detailed in terms of islands and nations.Would I recommend this game? Definitely, it's not finished yet, early access and all,  there are still a lot of missing features, especially in regards to the open world, but the game already brought me so much delight, that I definitely got my money's worth.

								I loved this game when i originally bought it but unfortunately in its current state i cannot reccomend it. I tried it with friend after they added the open world and unfortunately it doesnt work. When the game was originally released it was a world of warships style battle game set in the age of sail but then they decided (on a whim it would seem) to switch it into an open world game. Unfortunately this led to the game feeling completely incomplete and a unfocused. They need to rediscover what made  this game great and focus on that. Currently you gain 4xp for a battle (which the community says is the best way to level up) but that 4 xp counts towards the 500xp needed to level up. All of the big ships require a huge crew and you only get bigger crews through leveling up.			"

Early Access Review
								its a great game and is very addicting, but there are issues and yes its an alpha but these need to be addressed now before its a full game. 1.) the aiming- the aiming is terrible, i cant find out where to aim with it, its a thin red or white line when i aim at the enemy ship, the cannons fly right over the ship when i aim at the water it shoots to low. its just very annoying and needs to be fixed and updated. 2.) the map- the map is very little help as all it does show the land masses and how big the map is, BUT THERE IS NO INDICATOR OF WHERE YOU ARE AT, NO ARROW OR DOT OR LINES OF TRAVEL. now its realistic but i think for players sanity of finding out where to go needs to be updated. 3.) now if you like it hardcore then skip this if you do. you pay alot for your ships then they sink 5 times thats it, its gone, you can of course buy repair kits for nearly 3000 gold for each on a 5th rate, i get it but the price of ships need to be lower abit for that (FYI there are 7 rates and a 5th rate can cost up to 150000 gold and there are limited numbers of ships that can be bought in the port so you might not see the ship you want avalible). NOW that is out of the way the goods. its a very realitic game though the ai is stupid but i wish you could walk on your ship but I cant deny i put hours into this game. the level up is a bit weird but you will understand it later and for an very new alpha it has alot of potental to be one of the best games ever. big open world sailing on your own vessal the size of the HMS VICTORY is pretty cool i think. and there are plenty of nations to choose to be, even a pirate. plenty of varity of ships as well so i still recommend it and support this amazing game just a few errors but its new i'll cut it some slack. NOW THEN YA LANDLUBBERS, SEE YA AT SEA. SET SAIL, HOIST THE ANCHORS, DOUSE THE ROYALS			"

Early Access Review
								=== More Complete Than A Lot of Recent AAA's === Does Combat for the Era Justice ===Even for an Early Access review, I can definitely recommend this game. It does naval battles very well, but it also does an open, real time world very well too. The game has plenty of content in terms of both progression and exploration. The world is huge. It sort of simulates a live economy of goods and services. There's also almost a dozen factions/countries with a pretty decent community so far.The game plays well and looks good. There are a ton of 'Pros'. The only two 'Cons' is that it's a massive time Vampire and there are a couple of bugs that are super annoying right now. I imagine the later will get fixed, but the first is going to be up to you. It's all multiplayer and getting together with friends is easy, fun, and fairly balanced. I wouldn't say it's dependant on playing with friends, too; it's got plenty of content. "

								Outstanding game so far. Naval Action captures the difficulty, chaos, and terror of naval combat unlike any other game since Silent Hunter III. Its open world is influenced heavily by EVE Online and Mount & Blade, and while systems are rudimentary, they are all in tact and functioning. The size of the world is truly impressive -- the entire Caribbean, modelled precisely. It takes about 3 real-life hours to cross the map, if you have the wind... The political system is very intriguing and already shaky alliances have formed between certain nations. Gameplay is remarkably tight for an early access title -- I have encountered literally no bugs, glitches, freezes, etc. The combat is difficult but accessible for new players, and the graphic fidelity in the battles is basically AAA quality -- think a cross between Wargame: Airland Battle and World of Warships at max settings but with MUCH better ocean, sound and smoke effects. Ships are modelled in much more clarity and detail than WoWS and waves and storms can dramatically influence battles. This game needs more press and exposure. I've played every major war game, sim, etc., and Naval Action is the most promising I've played in a long time. Is it worth $40? Absolutely. The test UI is clunky and certain features need iteration, but the game is pretty much there and without the glitchy nonsense that afflicts most Early Access titles. This is 100% more polished than Day Z SA. "

								Great game, no silver spoon, a lot of skill required to be competitive, skill can trump gear and ship classes, ai is decent and consently being improved, but pvp is where the game shines.If you like eve online, slower pace and 18th cenutry naval era then this is a perfect game, it is still in development, devs active on the forums discussions and you can give them feedback and suggestions on how to improve the game.Its not a game that will reward you instantly (other than achieving something) do not expect to sail the biggest ships within the first week or within the first month.  Heck it might even take you a few tries to sink or capture your first ship, but once you start learning about the combat mechanics you will get better and better and on your way to gain more crew and the ability to man bigger ships and learn how to sail those.Definitly worth the price.

								Loving the game. Less than 12 hours in, the game is packed full of action and adventure. Not only that, but it's actually the best Age of Sail game I've ever seen. Literally. Early Access truly does not exist to these developers in their dictionaries. They have dedicated their time to make one of the best games in the Naval category. After starting as a basic cutter, you progress through the ranks of your nation (or ""pirate nation"") and end up being a First Rate ship of the line*. During this time you'll experience friendships, hardships, fun, and other emotions. But in the end, you love the game and enjoy the work you've taken in over the time of such. You learned how to trade, how to fight, and how to ship as a naval captain.  If you want to play a game filled with adventure, action, the sea, and naval combat, then this is the right game for you. Maybe you just want something to waste your time on? Then this is your game. I recommend purchasing this game in Early Access for multiple reasons that are too much to explain on this. In other words, you'll have a great time with this title.*I do not currently own a 1st Rate ship. I am merely only giving you an example.			"

								One of the best early access games I have ever played.I encountered like 2 or 3 little bugs in more than 40 hours playing it. If you disable anti aliasing (currently drops FPS into nowhere) you get a great performance even with lots of ships in a battle.The servers never crashed so far and the ping was always around 20-30ms. No lag at all.The game itself is great so far. There is a lot of content for an early access game and you can do a lot of things from piracy over crafting huge ships to run missions or hunt hostile fleets (NPC and players).The ships are very balanced and every ship has it's own advantages and disadvantages compared to others of the same class.The NPCs you will mostly fight will get better if you climb up ranks and you will have a hard challenge every now and then.If you like a rather slow combat style, ships, open world and a ton of cannons - this game might be something for you.The game has a lot of potential and I'm sure the devs will know how to make use of it. I cleary recommend the game and I would pay the 37€ again.			"

If you find interest in the time period I would defiently reccomend this game to you. It is worth every single penny.Only thing that is not so cool about it, is that it can get very repetetive. It takes a lot of time to rank up, but I do believe that is how it should be. Very hard to start out, but when you get the hang of it you will find it hard to stop playing.  Name Age   Patrick 16 "

								Get this game. This is a very good game. Though it takes some time to get gold and ships do cost a lot... This game is still in development and I would strongly recommend you trying this game out if you are into a very realistic sailing simulator set arround the pirate age. I love the combat in this game and I hope they will add different maps and reigions to the game, also lowering ship costs in the game might make it easier and more fun to play. So it definately still needs some big changes to be made. There are only a few ships affordable (easy to get with the amount of gold you earn in each battle) are only a few.  I think this is a game that really shows off the ""Age of sail"" and at the moment I give it a 8.9/10 since it still is in alpha stage and I personally think that there are quite a few improvements to be made and many things to be added. Though afterall this is still in alpha.			"

								AHOY ME MATIES! Welcome Aboard me cutlas!. Naval Action Is What Assasins Creed IV Black Flags multiplayer should of had. A more realistic approach than its rival Tepest. Loads of fun Attacking Pirates, enemy nations, and sailing the high seas. PLEASE PLEASE add Sea Shanties!!! I love listening to Assasins Creed IV's Sea Shanties while playing this game and it just makes the experience sooooo much better. 10/10 would Sail the High Seas Again. AVAST YE SCURVY DOG! I'll EET Yer Livers FER BREAKFAST AND DRINK YER BLOOD AS WINE!Also please add taunts like that one O.O I fell in love with this game immediately which doesn't happen with games much.EDITSome personal complaints include rediculously overpriced ships, and XP gain isn't high enough.

								Okay so for start...Yes you are right this is a high price for an early acces game.......But it's worth it because there is no other game I know that has really awsome good old fashion sailing battles like this game.Cannonshots roar out, smoke fills the horizon  you see wood chips fly of  enemy ship's sails tear and masts break.the combat is so good it makes all other naval games  look like bad april fools jokes.Navigating in the vast open world can be a challange cause you only have a map and a compass to guide you with no fake location marker so yopu have to look for land marks and plot course aheadYes it's alpha the menu's in harbours are crude and the trading is kinda bare bone now but I have a feeling this will all shape up in the upcomming months.Also note worthy is that the coop with friends works really well.I hope many many more will take the risk jump in and suport this game casue it's one unique gaming experience  "

								Very realistic game, it's a complete naval simulator. During the battles you must consider the wind direction, take care of the orientation of your sails to turn correctly.During this beta period the developers are taking so much care about the community asking about the continuous development of the game, for example; I'm playing in the Spanish faction which have some problems with port capture balance, but nowadays the developers ask the community to try to solve them correctly and make the game more competitive and more balanced.Trade system seem a bit simple nowadays although factions have to take care of their ports because ports:-Demand Material, and Produce materiales, some of the materiales produced are needed for the boat craft system.The game is so perfect in the small details in the boats, that is incredible to believe.Soon is a new actualization with more new content.If you like the naval simulation, you'll enjoy the game for sure.

								Wow! So for early access this game would be great as if they did nothing else! Very suprised at the game mechanics, graphics, MMO fluidity, and trading system. So what for some of the positives:1) Easy Chat for Nation, global or learning.2) Smooth Battle sequences and transition into them.3) something fo reveryone - if trade is your thing, trade. Craft - craft. Fighting - well you have to learn to sail and battle on the high seas, if not you losse your neck to the enemy or pirates!4) Graphics are amazing.5) The world is vast and based in some of the natural history (although many liberties taken). If you want to sail all over, make new warehouse and dock at ports, expect to have the realism and time invested in doing so. At first I didnt like this aspect, but now after playing hours upon hours I respect it.6) Potential. Even though this game is great as is - it has great potential to go in many directions.7) Action. There is down time in the game - but if you want action it can be found almost anywhere on the seas.Some negative points:1) Hard learning curve at first. If your not dedicated, I could see where you would easily give up. It would be nice to have a tutorial or two for the new gamer coming into the world. So often on the chat I see, ""So what do I do - Im new?""2) Action will get old - and so will crafting  at a certain point. Although the ship production line is quite extensive, it would be nice to open the ports, towns, and overall system to incude other aspects such as food, living quarters in town, explorations, and aging of ships just to mention some ideas.3) Capture and boarding of ships also gets old, would be nice to see something in the way of diplomatic surrenders like, ""If you stop shooting at me ill give you half my cargo!""So I hoped this helped. Alot of hours in before writing review, and Ive enjoyed this game immensly! Cheers!			"

								Im not going to explain in depth what the game has to offer. Plenty of others better at this game than me have done that. What I can say and assure you is that you will get your moneys worth. For an early access game this is very solid. To me it seems they nailed the ships, fighting, sailingmechanics and left things like the ui to be worked on and other things too of course. But making what has to do with ships spot on before release makes it a very enjoyable early access. The game doesnt seem to suffer from having an application run on the side like spotify or mediaplayer playing music (movie music in my case to enhance the atmosphere). Sailing isnt just turning left or right as you will find out. You can change to manual skipper that makes you control the trim of the sails and make much sharper turns but it will take some training to get it right. I hate to buy games that makes me feel dissapointed but this game Im glad i purchased.			"

Early Access Review
								Naval Action is a very short indie title about a man waiting for his ship to arrive and I ♥♥♥♥ing hated it.The main reason I hated this game was mainly due to the usual false expectations scenario. Rather than just completely rip this game apart let me explain what I thought the game was going to be, and then what the game actually is.What I thought Naval Action was going to be:Everything I thought this game was going to be came from what people posted about on the internet. Nothing I am writing in this section is what I hoped the game would be, this is what I expected based on others experiences with it. Like I mentioned above, this is a game about a man waiting for his ship to arrive at his house. However, I was under the assumption that this would be 1st person, without any narration, and you are completely free to do whatever you want while you wait for the ship. You do not know what ship class it is, or why this man is possibly being stood up. Maybe this is him being dumped, maybe he destroyed it, maybe he doesn’t have a ship and he’s lonely, we just don’t know. While waiting for your possible ship to arrive, you are free to do whatever you want in your apartment. Doing actions will affect the outcome of the ship’s quality. Maybe you could eat your entire meal before it shows up, would that have an effect? Maybe if you drink the whole bottle of wine you will pass out and miss the ship entirely, never knowing if the vessel came by or not. Maybe you could just sit there and wait the entire time, twiddling your thumbs, eagerly watching the clock. Maybe you could just ♥♥♥♥ing kill yourself, the point is what sold me on this game was mystery. Every time I looked into this game online, for whatever reason, the game was completely shrouded in mystery, and this made me want to play the game so badly. I was honestly expecting to play this game multiple times just to see what else I could make happen. There could’ve been so many possibilities, so many outcomes, but as you can guess I ended up being tremendously disappointed.What Naval Action actually is:A monologue. The game is literally just a monologue disguised as a video game. If there are any David Cage fanboys reading this, buy this game right now. NOTHING you do while you “wait” for your ship matters. I only played this game once and I went in with the intention of killing my character through alcohol abuse, but even though I am drinking down a glass of wine every 5 seconds, the character doesn’t shut up…even while he is drinking. You are forced to listen to this guy whine and complain and there’s nothing you can do about it. Yeah, there are actions, but they are ♥♥♥♥ing meaningless. I’m pretty sure if someone smoked 47 cigarettes in a row he would maybe cough a few times in the middle of his ♥♥♥♥♥ing. The game kept giving me hope that something good would happen. Oh look! He’s getting up! Can I jump out the window? Nope. Can I open my fridge? Nope. Well, can I grab that endless bottle of rum again? Not right now, nope. When I realized that I could just sit back and the game would play itself I decided to stick through to the end, with the hope that maybe something interesting would happen, but of course not. You listen to this guy whine and complain about life for awhile and then that’s it, it just ends. He doesn’t kill himself (sadly), the ship never shows up, nothing ♥♥♥♥ing happens. The best part about the uh experience is the torture is short. My game time for this is 23 minutes and I waiting till the credits ended.So that’s it, I can’t even recommend this game to people who enjoy monologues, or hearing sad..ish life stories. Rather that waste your time listening to this guys issue’s you could go hang out with your friends, and maybe help them with their problems. I can promise in that situation different outcomes and functionality that makes an impact, I dare you to try and drink as much wine as I did in this game while hearing your friend talk. In other words, real life is more of a video game than Naval Action.			"

								If you are looking for a very realistic in depth game based on sea battles and voyage of the 1700's onward... you will for sure want to try this game. To be bold its not for people interested in the time line but those people that already have a deep seated fandom of the period. The game requires some time and patience to get going but after you get the basics down the game comes to full life and really stands alone. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves the time period and you should pic it up if you do.			"

								I love Pirates, and to a lesser extent general caribbean naval stuff.  I also love story and adventure and in that aspect the game falls just a little short, not of what it's trying to be, just what I wanted watching early Dev diaries.  Maybe the features to craft your own story (or even have a visible or defined character-there are no RPG elements) will come in the future but im not sure that's really what the developer is interested in.And that's okay!  As a naval combat simulation alone Naval Action is fantastic.  It's gorgeous, detailed, more realistic than anything I've seen and hopping on with a friend to hunt some french merchantmen is a blast.  It has massive PvP with dynamic ownership of ports between the many belligerent Powers and a decent trading system which may be far deeper than I've seen so far and rewards planning and being in touch with the community to know goods prices in your next port.In short although Naval Action isn't everything I want in a Carribean Adventure it's EXACTLY what IT wants to be.  If you understand what you're getting I highly recommend.			"

								I really, really, really, really want to love this game. I still have my hopes for it and will keep playing. I would'nt recommend the game at the moment unless you like seeing a gem of a game get developed before your eyes. The game lacks excitement but has tons of potential. The missions are tedious after a while but are unfortunately the only good way of making money and xp. Otherwise, esecially at the beginning, you are attacking traders and making some money and xp. IF the devs have done one good thing its the ship mechanics. They remind me somewhat of Assassin's Creed Black Flag. All they need to do no is provide a arena mode were you will earn money and xp when its done. Like Overwatch. Then when your not in the arena mode and are waiting for a game, your out doing those missions i was talking about as well as attacking traders and ships from other nations. It would then be my idea of the perfect game.			"

								This game is so much fun!  The naval battles are great, I can angle my hull to try and deflect shots away.  The battles seem realistic and are a ton of fun.  The average battle for me is about 30 - 45 min.  The crafting is in depth and well worth the time put in.  The only problem I have is the ui but it is an alpha ui that will be replaced later on.  It has been well worth the price tag for me.			"

								This game is so much fun!  The naval battles are great, I can angle my hull to try and deflect shots away.  The battles seem realistic and are a ton of fun.  The average battle for me is about 30 - 45 min.  The crafting is in depth and well worth the time put in.  The only problem I have is the ui but it is an alpha ui that will be replaced later on.  It has been well worth the price tag for me.			"

								I really, really, really, really want to love this game. I still have my hopes for it and will keep playing. I would'nt recommend the game at the moment unless you like seeing a gem of a game get developed before your eyes. The game lacks excitement but has tons of potential. The missions are tedious after a while but are unfortunately the only good way of making money and xp. Otherwise, esecially at the beginning, you are attacking traders and making some money and xp. IF the devs have done one good thing its the ship mechanics. They remind me somewhat of Assassin's Creed Black Flag. All they need to do no is provide a arena mode were you will earn money and xp when its done. Like Overwatch. Then when your not in the arena mode and are waiting for a game, your out doing those missions i was talking about as well as attacking traders and ships from other nations. It would then be my idea of the perfect game.			"

								Wow! So for early access this game would be great as if they did nothing else! Very suprised at the game mechanics, graphics, MMO fluidity, and trading system. So what for some of the positives:1) Easy Chat for Nation, global or learning.2) Smooth Battle sequences and transition into them.3) something fo reveryone - if trade is your thing, trade. Craft - craft. Fighting - well you have to learn to sail and battle on the high seas, if not you losse your neck to the enemy or pirates!4) Graphics are amazing.5) The world is vast and based in some of the natural history (although many liberties taken). If you want to sail all over, make new warehouse and dock at ports, expect to have the realism and time invested in doing so. At first I didnt like this aspect, but now after playing hours upon hours I respect it.6) Potential. Even though this game is great as is - it has great potential to go in many directions.7) Action. There is down time in the game - but if you want action it can be found almost anywhere on the seas.Some negative points:1) Hard learning curve at first. If your not dedicated, I could see where you would easily give up. It would be nice to have a tutorial or two for the new gamer coming into the world. So often on the chat I see, ""So what do I do - Im new?""2) Action will get old - and so will crafting  at a certain point. Although the ship production line is quite extensive, it would be nice to open the ports, towns, and overall system to incude other aspects such as food, living quarters in town, explorations, and aging of ships just to mention some ideas.3) Capture and boarding of ships also gets old, would be nice to see something in the way of diplomatic surrenders like, ""If you stop shooting at me ill give you half my cargo!""So I hoped this helped. Alot of hours in before writing review, and Ive enjoyed this game immensly! Cheers!			"

								I could sit here and write a 3 page story about how good this game is... or I could leave you with a few facts, and let you decide for yourself:1. I play TONS of video games, from many different companies ranging from AAA titles, down to little-known indie games.2. This is in my top 5 games that I've played in my entire life. I'm 26 and have been gaming since I could reach a keyboard.3. Hands down one of the best development teams I've ever seen. I could write an entire story about this topic alone, but simply put- they're amazing. They do what they're supposed to do, and do it with excellence, and on time.4. If you're a fan of Naval Combat, Open World Adventuring, Trading/Economy, Collecting Stuff (a hoarder like me), or simply are a fan of beautiful graphics topped with a superb physics engine... BUY THIS GAME. WHY ARE YOU WAITING? STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT!			"

								I have bought this game when it was in very early Alpha access and only the combat testing, called Sea Trials was available. I am involved in the development process of this game for more than a year now.From the start, I was very impressed by what the Developers want to create here. And that with a quite small team of developers.Sure,there are some bugs and the game still isnt completely finished (for example there is close to no GUI for the Harbors), but you can see the effort which is put into developing the game. And the progress is also visible. This is no game, which might end up not getting developed further. For more than a year I could follow the development progress and see first hand, that tester suggestions are taken seriously and often even get implemented into the game.The game has absolutly great sailing and gunnery physics and its a blast to sail around in the caribbean with some friends, searching for enemy fleets to destroy. Or prepare and execute a port assault together to get access to additional ressources for your faction.So if you are at all interested into the Age of Sail, this game is YOUR game. Buy it!in short:Great:Ship sailingGunneryModels of the shipsreally big Open worldBattles for control over the various portsGood:Rank progressionchoice of shipsnot so good:Missions (there are missions, but they are repetitive and kinda meh)GUI ( the GUI for the harbors for example is not yet really implemented, but they are working on it)Trading (work in progress)Crafting (work in progress)bad:no tutorial at allI could write much more about this great game, but I think this is enough to get a first impression about wether this game might be something for you. I#ll update this review in case something major changes.			"

								This game is great. That is, it was great, before they introduced the Open World Aspect. I loved the PvP Skirmish games, slowly upgrading my ship to the next size, battling it out in long slug fests, or sniping each other from across the map. It was great, it felt great.That combat is still here, sadly it is now hidden behind an almost impenetrable wall of barely functional UI's, bland, empty Open World Elements, and a dull, pointless grind back to the larger ships I know and loved playing in.The Open World Aspect is bare bones to say the least, and far from finished, so there is plenty to improve on, especially the UI, which even when it was just skirmish mode wasn't particularly great, but it didn't need to be.I wish they gave you the option for either Open World or Skirmish, so I could still enjoy the combat, while waiting out the Dev's improvements upon the Open World Aspects.There is no tutorial for the Open World mode (There wasn't for the combat either, but it was easy enough to pick up), it literally just thrusts you into a menu, and lets you fumble it out for yourself. After 10 minutes of faffing around, I got to 'sail', which is just a fancy word for ""Point your ship in a direction, and look around for things to do"" You can choose to battle ships that you see about, but 9 times out of ten, you won't see anything your 'level' anywhere. All I saw for an hour were Snows or Larger ships, which made easy pickings of my Cutter. The little battles that pop up here and there, are either 'closed' or spawn you so far from the action that you can't hope to get more than a few shots in.Since the Open World side of things was introduced, I have barely been able to play it for more than an hour at a time, eventually returning to see what has changed, to find nothing at all different about my experience.Before that, the game was fantastic. Brilliant combat, and a real intense atmosphere when you get into a full blown fight.I recommend it on the combat alone. If you can put up with a rather dull and frustrating grind, this may be for you, in its current state. I just wish we had the option to skirmish.Edit: Tried to play again more recently. Had some free money and a ship to play with. Sadly I didn't have the rank to have the crew with which to crew the ship effectively. Rendering it pointless. And ranking up? You need to grind missions. And missions? Long dull trip to point A. Wait for ship to appear you are allowed to fight. Hope you can kill it before it either A: runs, B: outruns you, or C: Kicks your butt.If you win, you get a bit of gold, about 50xp towards your goal of 500xp for your First Rank. Of which there are many, with ever increasing xp requirements.I tried again to play this, and again, it just isn't fun anymore. Its a whole lot of waiting  for your ship to eventually reach a point, and once they get there, hope you can get a /little/ bit of ""Naval Action"" in. I wish the AI was a bit more aggressive. Usually it either just runs, even when it has a much better ship than me, or it goes in annoying circles, that benefit nothing but time wasting.There is a mission system now however (Essentially skirmish), but every time I've played, I've been put up against a much larger ship. I haven't advanced out of the cutter yet, but I'm being put up against 64 Gun vessels or worse, on my own. WTF?			"

								If your looking for something different, then this could be it. PRO'sStunningly beautiful graphics, when in battle. Large open world Seems to attract more mature players. (Maybe not enough instant gratification for younger players)Lots of helpful players available online during the gameMany different aspects to the game, sailing, trading, crafting, building ships, upgrades and of course brilliant battles.Great deal of hard work from the developers with lots of regular updates and improvements to game playRewards skill and effortNo obvious hacking or cheats in the game that I have seen or heard of, though there have been some exploits that have been taken advantage of.CONSNo manual. Very confusing for beginners, initially.A lot of the online info is wrong / out of date due to game changes by the developersRequires considerable player effort to understand and enjoy - but this will be a positive factor for manyUI crude but works well enough, even if its a bit vague and confusing at the moment. This is due to be updated.SUMMERYThis is an Early Access game, but far more developed and playable than most. It has  (FEB 2016) strong support from the team. This has the potential, to be something very special. Nothing like the satisfaction of out maneuvering and out shooting an enemy. And nothing quite as humiliating as sinking after a heavy defeat, or seeing your crew decimated prior to being boarded. A recent update from the developers said they feel the mechanics are near right now and they will concentrate on added improvements to game content. Guess this means the UI in particular and general polishing.But if your considering buying the game, do be prepared for some serious searching for info in the early stages!Would sink again. 8/10 at the moment. Potential 10/10.			"

								Already a heap load of fun, this game has bags of potential and will only get better and better.It IS early access, but well worth the money in my opinion. The developers are working hard and patches/hotfixes are frequent.Currently the UI is placeholder and well below standard, but it's functional at least. The game itself, the ships and the scenery are looking lovely though and it really captures the feeling of being in a sea battle.The community tends to be very mature. Use of voice comms is frequent and large clans are organising for massive fleet battles on a daily basis but it's still very possible for you to solo if you are that way inclined. Some work needs to be done to balance the gold income here and there but that'll come in time.There is currently next to no help ingame, but there is an unofficial wiki and a help chat channel in which people are more than pleased to provide answers.On the whole, I'd wholeheartedly recommend this game as long as people understand that they really are buying a game that is (heavily) in development. I have no doubt that this game will see full release, the developers are excellent and the communication with the community is top notch.Finally a game that is going to give Early Access a good name.

								Great game that captures the challenges of the era. To start the game it is advisable to at least grasp the basics of sailing (with wind and sails only), once you have that part down the learning curve turns to gunnery and aiming given the available technologies during the 1700-1800s pre motorization area. If you decide to progress further crafting or building ships is also available which will challenge your abilities even moore. This game has a variety of ways to challenge the most ardent sailing-battle fan. Finally missions both individual or multiplayer are also available from beginner to advanced, but beware you may get sunk and returned to port without a boat and have to sail the lowly Cutter back home. Highly recommended.			"

Early Access Review
								In a nutshell: The game is currently building its already solid foundation in Alpha testing.Ships traverse an overworld with sped up movement, similar to mount and blade. Combat occurs when a ship chooses to attack you (and attempts to keep you within a certain radius of his ship in a circular ring), or when you choose to enter an instanced event/mission/battle area.Combat involves sailing around and attempting to blast your enemy to bits before he blasts you. Ships have somewhat realistic damage models and can take hits on different sides. Leaks, fires, loss of crew will all act to the detriment of the ship. You manage crew and can select what tasks you want them to focus on. At the moment this is the most complete aspect of the game.Ships and assets can be crafted, but ships may also be captured via boarding (where you manage crew in a rock paper scissors type minigame and attempt to reduce enemy crewcount or morale to 0). Ships sunk will lose a count of durability. Crafted ships will have up to 5 ""lives,"" captured ships or the more powerful first rate ships will only have one.Servers are PvE or PvP (other players may attack you in the overworld). The most active server is PVP1 for the EU.You may also attempt to capture ports in special port battles, and secure a port for use by your own nation. Ports have hard hitting artillery fortifications. You will need a group to attack and defend ports.Progression is centered on the aquisition of experience, money, and assets. You can obtain money and assets through trade, crafting, or combat solo or in a group, and xp through combat.Nations are entities which can take and hold ports. You select a nation at character creation, and nations will act hostile to all but themselves (player driven diplomacy is currentlg the only diplomacy in game). Pirates function like a nation, but can attack other pirates as well.PvE exists as NPC ships in missions, events, or fleets in the overworld.The UI is barebones and there is little to no official documentation or tutorial to the game.Don't forget that its early access.

								I will rate this game 6/10.This game have good graphics and solid gameplay in terms of naval combat in the Age of Sail genre. Actually the best what you can find and thus it is the reason why I purchase it.I can't give it full points, despite the only game in its  genre fulfulling all the mechanics and solid, smooth gameplay. This game is extremely time consuming. Prepare to have a book while playing this game, because it is very slow paced. The naval battles are fine, but the Open World experience is something most people want to be revamped.There are numerous other reasons why this game doesn't favour casual gamers and is more geared towards hardcore gamers. It is time consuming, limited features in economy which could be improved upon, time consuming and long distances to sail. Expect to spend more or less an hour in the Open World before arriving at a certain port or battle location.Also note the devs are a small group and take very long to implement updates. An update each month and then patches in the upcoming weeks. Much more could be desired and feedback is only considered from hardcore longtime standing players, making it difficult for new casual gamers to fit in.Good graphics, solid gameplay, but favour too much to hardcore gamers, bland economy and time consuming. 6/10.EDIT: I change the downvote to an upvote, all the above still applies, but the recent patches make the game more interesting and the introduction of alliances certainly changes a lot of things. I hope the economy can be addressed and then I might change my review completely.			"

								Patch 9.96 was horrible it introduced in October / November, luckily patch 9.97 which have just been released today, reverted the negative things. Naval Action has again become interesting and fun to play.I returned to the game just before the release of patch 9.97 simply because I used to love this game and would hate to see it perish. Naval Action is truly a beautiful game, although a niche one, since you have to have a thing for sailing ships in order to remain interested for longer time. The game do have decent action in it if you know where to look. But the shear beauty of these old and famous ships and details within the game, can mean the game comes back to live again.Remember this is an EA game, so be prepared for massive changes some for the worse, others for the good. But in all, I would again recommend Naval Action once again.			"

								FIRST REVIEW BEFORE EDIT: Really good so far looking forward to playing more. I would recomend this game so far there are a bunch of really cool people in game and its enjoyable. (update when more hours will come).EDIT: After all this time I am Changing my review of Naval Action, I am doing this because the Developers have not actively listened to the comunity and have all but compleately ruined their game that once held a lot of potential and was so much fun. They took away any aspect of fun and made the game a compleate stare at ocean simulator. Ever since they took away teleporting its been impossible to have any combat fun unless you sink hours into the game for small pvp battle. On top of this they ruined crafting making it ruthlessly hard and now ship prices are out of this world. Basically if you do have any combat and you lose a ship well now your screwed there to.IN SHORT: I can not recomend naval action as the Devs are doing everything in their power it seems to anger their dwindling player base and have not truly given anything we have asked for. This game is already appealing to a super small niche of player, however the devs want that number to be even fewer it seems so that their empty game can further its barren existance.DISLCAIMER: If this review is taken down its probobly because the ""Devs"" labeled it as false information, which is not true however they like to censor oppinions that speak out so it won't supprise me, so much for freedom of speech am I right. Oh wait forgot you dont have that in russia right?			"

								750+ hours in game should say quite a bit about how much I liked this game, but that changed.The devs made some serious mistakes and pushed the ""difficult"" side of things way too far. You spend more time looking for fun, than finding it. They burned out the early access crowd, and it's hard to see who else this game may appeal to.For an early access game, I got more than my moneys worth, I only hope they make the final version worth playing again. I can't bring myself to spend time in it any more.Wait and look for other reviews post 2016 to see if things have been sorted.			"

								Stubborn devs thinking they can push release, at this slow pace of development good luck. Kickstarters for ships when the game isn't even finished? Nice idea. Let's grab more cash as if it wasn't enough already from all the people that bought this game for 37 ♥♥♥♥ing euros and if the devs are trying to say that they are running out of money by saying they want kickstarters for new ships then just ♥♥♥♥ off. No. I do not recommend this game at all unless you really really love ships and have 12 hours a day to spare.			"

								Naval Action what can you really say. IT IS F@#KING AWESOME. There are over 20 ships and they are adding more, hundreds of ports to visit and explore and the pvp is intense no other way to put it. The ship combat is the most well balanced out of all the sailing games I have played. The community is friendly so long as there your nation. ;p The map is huge. You can build, fight, or just explore. The detail of the ships and the world is aw inspiring. 10/10 First game I have reviewed EVER and that is why.			"

								Just like that I've literally sunk (hehe) 20 hours into this game D:. Really fun game, at the begginning it may seem kind of over whelming as their is no guides what so ever but after watching a few YoutTube videos here and there you get the jist of the game pretty quick. The feeling of getting what seems like your first proper ship which is for me the ""snow"" is amazing. Wouldn't really call it a grind as I had a lot of fun getting enough experience to rank up which in itself isn't that bad. Overall would recomend to anyone willing to sink a few hours into it as your love will soon develop and for some reason I cannot yet understand myself why, It's just fun! PVP combat is a big plus factor in this game and is done really well. Everything you do and achieve actually feels rewarding which is what I love in a game.			"

								Set in the age of sail, Naval Action has a big learning curve. With no in game tutorial working out what you need to do and how to even play the game can be very difficult, however once you final figure it out, it's very rewarding. The map and ships are beautifully done, you can easly get distracted looking around. There is no in game navigating in a sence, however there is a map and compass so it's back to basics with working out where you need to go and how to get there. it can take some time looking for the start points for missions. However I feel it adds to the overall feel and look of the game, however I feel that by adding a sextant or even the ablity to navigate using the star's will make for much better immersion. Sailing the ships is easy, but as you progress up to much bigger ship's a sailing tutorial would be benefitual. There are video's on YouTube showing how to use the sails and these would be worth a watch if starting out. Overall I feel this game has great potential and if the devs continue in the direction they are heading I believe it will will be a fantastic game once fully finished, with the possibility of adding more maps to the game or even expanding the current in game map there will be no shortage of content.

								Very well crafted game, deep in details such as not only sailing and gunnery combat, but trade, crafting, ship building, port captures, teamwork, etc. Very easy way to spend an evening. Visuals and sound are very good. For instance, when a cannon is fired from a nearby ship, you will see the flash and smoke, then hear the BOOM! Weather affects visibility. Rank is important for crew command size and ship building. Over all, very well done. Still in alpha phase at this point but well worth the investment in my opinion.			"

								Do NOT BUY.1) game is dying, less than 700 active players for more than 330 ports. Check steamdb !2) Time sink: sail 30 min minimum, have a 15 min fight and sail 30 min back. Real time sailing for nothing. I have set course and gone shoppng, after 1.5 hrs I came back and NOTHING had happened.3) toxic community: the game's great, or you get spanked heavily4) stubborn devs: only listen to hardcore simulation fans. As a MMO a complete failure5) economy: devs don't know anything how that thing works, exploits are common6) what to do: sail, attack a trader, make a mission (if you find it), or  a port battle. That's it.7) Port battles: what are they good for? One port is like any other8) pay full price in january and see that it gets discounted in summer sale after 5 months. No redeemables for people who have supported the game since long ago.9) devs got about 2,5 million cash. Lot of money for a game which will NEVER make it.10) I logged 500+ hours. KEEP AWAY			"

								A well thought out simulation of 'blue water' sailing of ships of the ""Wooden Ships and Iron Men"" era popularized in the Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin novels and films, this provides the Player with the ability to captain his/her own trade ship or warship sailing and trading between ports or engaging in realistic ship-to-ship combat.  Both one-to-one, fleet-to-fleet, and Player-to-Player combat is enabled in the PvP version. The game map is extensive, and includes all of the east coast of the Americas, the Gulf of Mexico and the Carribbean Sea.  One sails seamlessly over the entire map, encountering trading vessels and warships, some operated by other human Players, others by AI Non-Player-Characters.  In the ""PvP"" version, one is enabled to attack or be attacked by other Human Players from opposing national factions, or by the ever-threatening Pirate faction.  The trading simulation provides an economic model that enables the human player to earn money without fighting, or to win game money, Experience Points toward promotion (and larger, more powerful ships), and seize ships and cargo from adverse faction ships as prizes.  The game requires some patience, some understanding of the interaction between sails, wind and simple 'dead reckoning' navigaton.   A rewarding experience for those seeking some taste of what it was like circa 1800 in a warship or trading vessel going in harms way for the chance of adventure and gold.  Highly recommended.			"

								I recommend playing less than 2 hours and then having a good long think about what you just paid $40 for.Some major cons for me.UI is a shambles, and while it does say ignore the UI in the UI that doesn't help much.It's $40 and it is not even close to being worth it. I'm all for supporting a developer, I bought this with a friend, that's $80 that we both ended up getting a refund for. Had it been $20, I would have kept it and just hoped it got better. Took it as it is, a fun little sea battle game.Very little in the game helps you along, and my first battle lasted about 40 minutes 1 on 1. It was painfully slow and I had no idea what I was doing. I'm genuinely shocked at the ""Very positive"" reviews.Dislike the crewing of my crappy little tub, my guys just kinda did repetative things and when I had less crew than it said I had I am pretty sure I counted them all still there. That spoiled the immersion for me, it was dissapointing.YES, IT IS EARLY ACCESS!I know this, but I did expect more because the price they are asking.Take a page out of WarThunders book, have a physics system that you can see. If I broadside a ship I want to see bits of railings fly off because a ball flew through it, and those railings stay gone. I want to hit a sailor with a grape shot and see him DIE or get flung overboard. I want to see crew scurrying around doing things that makes me feel like I have an actual crew I give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about.*Edit* I stated earlier that I was with a friend, I could not find any way to group or locate or play with that person, I just happened to be playing the same game as him. We got in a sea battle together and ended up on opposite sides. That was the deal breaker for us. *Edit*That said, there are not many naval games out there, and I did enjoy the second battle which was a mass of ships, I had no idea what I was doing but I shot things and made holes in sails.The graphics are really nice and you can make some lovely cinematic stills, but uh.. you didn't pay $40 for cinematic stills did you now?End of the day, I'll follow this game and keep it on my wishlist for a future sale that is AT LEAST 50% off.Be warned guys, don;t let your desperation for some old timey naval combat get the better of you and part with your money because♥♥♥♥♥♥like this is part of the problem with the industry (that and microtransactions on full price games).

								Basically it's a nice game, and I want to play it for a longer time... but....   Once I'm logged into it I already feel bored and immediately log out.Why ? ...   Let me tell you some things you might need to know before purchasing it:Pros: + pretty neat interface while being on the ship, easy to understand + the first thing you'll notice are the waves. the water is so realistic to watch.. and even more realistic during battles, where u'll have more details+ steering a ship is fun too, there are a great variety of ships you can purchase during the game with many upgrades and different looks+ mixing a ship simulator with an mmo is a cool idea too+ you can be dutch, danish, sverige, american, british, french, spanish or join the pirates, which is the only faction who can attack eachother.+ day/night cyclusCons:- the waves could be much bigger at the sea- as nice as the UI is while outside on the sea, once you are in a Harbour/Port/Outpost the UI is big and confusing.- You gain 50 ish xp for a successfull mission in Level 1, and not more. You need 1000xp to Level 2 = Pure Mission Grinding!- There ain't alternatives to grinding missions, but to attack players of other countries, which you shouldn't do in early levels anyway, cause you have no effin chanceSo if you don't have mates to help you out in those missions wich are 1vs1 battles against AI Ships and 50% of them will destroy you in the beginning, you have a problem- one of those missions ( 1vs1 battles ) will last for 30minutes or longer until finally a ship is destroyed and will sink, whether its yours or the AI ship.- there are only 3 things to do in this game: missions ( which are always the same procedure ), pvp battles ( will be interesting in higher levels / you can attack Harbours too ) or you can just farm Gold by buying and selling goods in different Ports, but you cant gain xp from that and there ain't trading quests yet. If you decide to farm Gold first, you might be able to puchase bigger ships, but bigger ships need a bigger crew, and the amount of crewmember will increase with your rank/level only! so don't even think about joining a battle with a ship that needs 150+ crew and you only got your 40 member in level 1. Cannon reloadtimers will increase drastically, your turning and steering will be horrible, and you can't even manage to repair it either.So.. if you're already a fan of ships , especially old ones and don't care about the difficulties during the game, get it and travel the carribean sea! Otherwise, give it a couple more months and check if they added more content.Also feel free to check out my screenshots if you're interested.			"

								The game is decently entertaining.. the combat is very fun.. that being said finding missions is extremely difficult. If you use profanity you will have your chat privaledges revoked. This is a sandbox game your are not allowed to build whatever sandcastle you want inside. If you play Naval Action you are beholden to sets of rules not posted inside the game. The devs will make up rules instead of fixing in game issues and punish the player base for mistakes they have made rather than fixing it. WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS GAME YOU MUST REGULARLY CHECK INTO A GARBAGE FORUM(not in steam) OR RISK GETTING BANNED FOR THINGS THE GAME ALLOWS. If you are disliked in the game you can be brought on charges in a biased 3rd party ""tribunal"" and receive a ban. I have never in my life seen a game that you must frequently check changing rules that are not posted in the game. I like the game and will play it in the future but currently it is not worth $40 to play 2 seperatly games... forum pvp and open sea pvp.			"

								At this point and time I can in no way recommend this seemingly nice game. Here is why: First of all, the UI is absolutely horrible, and in addition, from what I gather through forum posts and the like, the devs do not intent to enhance it, or at least make it half way decent, in any way shape or form in the near future.Secondly the graphics. Played on ultra, with everything turned up, the game is still rough around the edges. For example, ropes on the ship are being formed in lines, even with AA turned to max, the contact of the ship with the water is in no way smooth, the vegetation on the islands contains very rough models, and suffers from similar AA problems, and the lighting/shading, is not remarkable either. Combine that with the fact that all you 'll be looking at in this game, are the above mentioned ship, islands and sea, the game is certainly no eye-candy at this point, for me at least. Whether the developers intend to enhance the graphics remains to be seen. Thirdly immersion. Having to go through loading screen after loading screen, even to engage enemy ships at sea, just totaly breaks immersion. I can understand, and forgive, a loading screen here and there, maybe when you enter major ports, but not when they litteraly precede every enemy encounter. Further more, when not engaged in combat, the ship seemingly runs itself, with not crew on deck, as if it was a ghost ship. Not only that, but even when you do get to see the crew, which is only in enemy engagements, the crew is poorly animated, and they do not even engage in activities around the ship, either following your orders, or passivly. They have only 1 animation ,which is to inspect the cannon, and even that is terribly done. This lack of the human factor is also present at ports, that look abandoned as a direct result of this. I really hope the developers do try and amend these issues someday.Moving on, perhaps the most awful thing about the game at this point, and something that I am afraid will not be changing, ever, is the grind. Going by reports in forums, and videos, along as with what little I could gather from struggling to understand the menu, the grind is horrendously long, even to match that of free-to-play MMOs. Difference is, I can understand why F2P MMOs need the grind, which is to generate income from people skipping said grind. But in a game you pay 40 dollars for, such a long grind is to my eyes completely unacceptable. Sure, im all for not giving everything away at once, but the system going at this point is just off the charts.On a positive note, If the game has one redeeming vertue even at this point, it is that of the combat system. That is truly enjoyable, and the battles are truly engaging. It is however too, quite slow, which I personaly do not mind, however this might be a nuisance to some people. All in all, the game feels too rough, and too early in development right now, which is not inherently a bad thing, but when the developers are asking a whooping 40 dollar fee, for this unfinished alpha, that you are going to be testing for them for free to boot, I can not, sanely recommend it. If the game gets patched up in the future, or if the developers realize they are asking too much for a game miles from being complete, and change the price, then I might come to recommend it. Until then, stear clear from this one.			"

								Game gets extremely repetative, Not worth the 54.99 pricetag. Its the most barebone game ive played in a while, their ship system is extremely confusing and offers no explanation besides online forums. Dont get this game. Future server wipes are going to happen to so anything you accomplish in this game will be wiped and it takes like 30 minutes to sail from port to port so honestly save your money and buy Mount and Blade.

								This game was decent, but now they have made the United States little more than a group to be picked on and sold over-priced items to. You can't build ships in U.S. because you need silver and various types of wood. The U.S. no longer has access to ANY silver mines and some of the better woods that you can build ships out of have also been taken away from them, including redwoods (which only grow in the U.S.). As far as I'm concerned, the devs have made the U.S. faction a laughing stock of the game, and I will neither play it or promote it any more.			"

								Due to the return policy on Steam I had to ditch this game before I could really experience anything except for a little bit of sailing and a pair of battles. A person looking to experience this game in a deep and meaningful way would need much more time than I could give it.  That being said I cannot reccomend this game as it is right now. Naval Action is an open world game in alpha stages of development (at time of writing). To be worth $40, a game should grab me very quickly with something, anything and Naval Action simply failed me in that regard. The primary pull at this time, naval combat, is novel but you could probably have just as much fun playing Patrician III or World of Warships. Take your forty bucks elsewhere for now and wishlist this game. For a piece like this it would be better to spend sixty dollars on a fleshed out product than forty dollars on what amounts to a whole lot of not much.			"

								The progression in this game is so slow. I dont do a lot of reviews but this is so PAINFULLY SLOW that I had to come in here and warn you. UNLESS YOU HAVE 8HRS A DAY TO PLAY ITS GOING TO TAKE YOU A WEEK TO GET OUT OF THE NOOB SHIPAfter almost 10 hours im about 8/10ths of the way through the first level... The game has no loot, it has no User interface, its crap right now I understand that the developers are used to making free to play games with free to play grinds but I payed for this, it shouldnt be so absolutely crazy!maybe if you fix the leveling system I will download it but right now ITS UNINSTALLED			"

								alright, in the beginning i was really drawn to this game, time period, the gun powder all that, that is why i bought it when it released.first of all, this game is NOT WORTH 37 euros, i can buy a triple A game for that money, so i EXPECT a good quality game with many features/ near finished. if its was like 10 to 15 euro range, i might gave it a thumbs up.Graphics 7/10the ships looks stunning. but the boat that you start out with, not so much. the big boates look amazing.i also loved it when you are sailing and in the far distance you see towers of a city sticking out so you know you are almost home.islands itself are quite dull, and low res.in battle, the ocean is beatifully done. the ships movement, are very well donedont get me started about the ui, its bland, boring and not user friendly, but hey its alpha right?gameplay 5/10the only thing i liked was the 'naval action' for the rest it was boring as ♥♥♥♥. this aspect of the game is not for most people.(so not for me.) you go out in the ocean looking for fights, or get a contract to battle a ship 1vs1. buddies with you could help with this grindfest. Then in the ports you can select small boat battles, and big boat battles. this is where everyone is. and because everyone is in the ports money/xp farming, there is almost no one in the open seas. developers need to get rid of that, or lower the rewards for the pvp battles.Technical 9/10this games runs very well on my system, gtx970, intel core i7.frames are always at 60fps+only minor thing i have is the daily maintance, this is the first game i see that has this. and if you are immersed you have to port, and log out for this maintence, or else you could lose progress.Final 4/10its just below average for me. but if you REALLY like boat battles from this time piriod and have patience with grinding 10 hours for a bigger ship, then by all means buy it. but for 37 euros, i can buy a triple A game that is finished and gives me more gameplay and enjoyment.

								Broke and in need of a new ship? Haha don't worry, there's tons of NPC's you can attack and board out in this active, open world game! Oh wait, there's not? Oh well, at least with a bit of searching (and getting lost), you'll come across something. You found something, GREAT! After you've committed to a battle that felt like hours (10/10 realism m80y), shot away at the enemies rigging and crew, THEN you can board them and take your prize! Oh wait, you can't? Oh well, you can just waltz back to harbor and get a few repetative missions that involve simple 1v1 ship battles against sloops! Either that, or get thrown into the games economics without any way of figuring out which way is up or which way is down. 10/10 best ship simulator 2k16			"

								As pretty as the ingame grahpics are shown during voyage and naval battle on the Store page, the game is very much in the early stages of development. There is a RAW GUI to navigate the game's many facets of gameplay. So raw, it's like Paintshop met MSWord with textboxes containing text menus, leaving  a very steep learning curve to navigate what the game has to offer. Naval Action is a game to watch and see what the developers end up doing with it. If there is to be a full release, it has at least another year of development ahead of itself. It definately aspires to be something like what ""Uncharted Waters Online' used to be, but in its' present state, I don't think it warrents a price tag of $40!!!			"

								Definitely not worth $40.  It's an alpha game but come on guys, $40 for an indie game? much less an alpha indie game?Right now, it's very boring. Played about an hour and a half. I have yet to find a port where the prices would justify any type of trading aspect to this game. They are pretty much the same wherever I go. I have a feeling if I sailed across the map I could probably make a few hundred gold on a load of cargo. The problem is, based on my observations so far, it would take hours if not days of real time to sail across the map.			"

								This game has an extensive and strict code of conduct. This code is not listed in-game, only on their forums. If a mod thinks you're not following it, you can get permanently banned from using all in-game chat. If this happens, there is no appeal process. It is account wide. The game does not tell you why. I once asked on their forums why they don't actually tell players their code of conduct if it's so important. One of the staff informed me that they do, it's linked right below the system requirements on this very store page! Go take a look.Now think to yourself if you want to buy a game with mechanics made by people who think that is a good idea.			"

								The good:Fantastic combat model (although somewhat flawed - see below)The bad:Grind, grind, grind (done to enable their pay2win plans)What do I mean by grind?  I've got 80 hours into the game, and I'm still sailing the starter ship.  Sure, I could be sailing the first square rigger (I just bought a snow), but why should I?  I'm almost broke, the starter ship is free, and I need to save for the next tier ship.  The system is broken.  XP is too slow (by about 4x) and gold is far too scarce.  People will say you can do it faster (and yes you can), but add in the reroll (because I picked France, and no one speaks English in chat), the failed try at trading (which is grindy), the aborted crafting try (which is grindy), and a days worth of exploring, and you are right at about 80 hours.  80 hours (probably closer to 70 due to idling).Still in the starter ship.Now, you will get many saying this isn't going to be pay to win.  Call it what you want, pay to play, play to win, pay to skip the grind - it's all semantics.  The people in denial are just trying to set up an MMO with an elite class of players (the ones willing to put tons and tons of time into repetitive missions), while the rest of us sit back and wish we were part of that elite class. Repetitive missions you say?  There's only ONE mission.  Sail out for 5 mins, kill the pirate (or pirates), sail back.  20  to 25 minutes total (if you know exactly what you are doing).  A resonable pace is 2 missions per hour.  At first, longer, and you will fail frequently.  You'll get about 90xp per mission (on your way to 1000xp for teir 2 - tier 3 another 1000, teir 4 another 3750).  You will need to get to tier 3 for your first significant ship upgrade, but you had better not been spending any gold.  You'll need every cent to buy and equip that next ship  (and after that, you won't want to sail it, because you wont want to lose it).  I like the difficulty - no complaints there.  Only problem - the grind. Rinse, repeat until you are numb.  Grind even more. Oh you can go after that unarmed trader instead for 40xp- what great excitement!  You could also play PvP for xp, which is much more interesting, but your xp rate/hour goes way down - and worst of all you will sink more often.  With anything but the free ship, sinking is expensive - so no more PvP for you!  Great design, huh?No thanks.  Save your money.  They make excuses  (it's an alpha!), well $40 sets a pretty high bar, unfinished or not.I should add, they will tell you that the Premium ships will only be cosmetic, but they are being dishonest. The Premium ships cannot be lost (but can be captured) (see source link below).The non-paying customers (I mean  the ones who refuse to pay more than the initial $40) get 5 sinkings per ship, then they are right back into the grind of paying for a new (expensive in terms of time) ship. That's the reason it's pay2win (or whatever you want to call it - semantics). The starter ship is free, so have fun with that, otherwise get your wallet out if you don't have hours and hours to play.A few more things...  Although the combat model is great, the AI cheats.  It has uncanny accuracy.  Devs say they won't tone it down because players eventually get good.  Well, this just punishes the new players.  And people don't actually get good at naval tactics.  They get good at learning to deal with a computer AI.  The technique of turning your bow or stern into an enemy to soak damage is almost laughable, and so unrealistic.  Oh, and the cannons are FAR too accurate.  Players are actually aiming for specific parts of the ships (trying to hit the masts, for example, or sneak a shot into the hull below the waterline).  For Pete's sake, these were smooth bore cannons on a very unstable platform!  Imagine you are on a real rocking ship, trying to time your shot with the rocking - you certainly aren't going to be aiming at the mast.  But in this game, no problem.  Shoot that mast clean off the ship if your aim is good enough (there's effectively a gyro stabilizer better than an M1 tank's in this game).  So if you are looking for realism, you won't find it here.For anyone considering this game, look at all those thumbs down.  This is an accurate review.  Those thumbs down show you the fan boys you'll be playing with - trying to dishonestly bury these facts.Dishonesty seems to be a theme with Naval Action.  Shame, shame, shame.*source of infinite durability (almost - ships cant be lost, but can be captured) - don't let anyone else say otherwise unless they give you a linkhttp://forum.game-labs.net/index.php?/topic/4668-open-world-prototype-rules-of-engagement-ship-loss-and-spawning/ "

								Don't waste your time.Naval Action is not ready for early access. Instead of adding much needed basic features to the game - such as a UI - they instead ruined what was once the most enjoyable aspect of the game: trading.In Naval Action, you are able to craft and sail the few ships that are available in game. A player had formerly been incentivized to explore and capture ports to find resources, make deals with other players, and steal ships to rob them of their parts. I suspect that this challenge was removed because the developers theorized that the playerbase is leaving due to the lack of progress that players experience. However, the game is not fun in the absense of a challenge and players like myself are leaving due to the game's volatility and nonsensical changes.There are only three things you can do in Naval Action:1) Stare at a featureless port UI screen2) Wander around a not-to-scale open world ocean (feels like you're sailing a remote-controlled toy)3) Fight in instanced battles, usually against AI			"

								Interesting game with stunning graphics. The ship combat takes a bit of time to master.  In order to hit a target and be effective you have to consider many factors.  At first it is a bit frustrating but the combat is quick to learn.  Things are just complicated enough that I learn a new trick now and then.  The absolute strength of the game is the combat engine and stunning graphics.  If you are a support type there are plenty of commerce and crafting   options.  Trade missions are profitable and people are always looking to buy new ships and ship modules.  The developers are responsive to players, almost too responsive.  They have been trying to make pvp “fair” because of the complaints of unwise players who constantly find themselves at a disadvantage.  Ultimately, consensual and fair fights will kill this game.  It is a pvp game, just toss people in and let them sort it out.  They will either need to stop coddling the people who can’t figure out tactics and team work or turn their PVE servers into a PVP server with strict rules of engagement for their players that need a “safe and fair place”.

								Read the other reviews, they are somewhat accurate. However... edit: Vast majority of negative reviews is not even remotely considered in any way whatsoever, very poor arguments, untrue facts, simple crying & moaning. Ignore them, they are primitive inferior creatures crawling the net looking for places to infest with their pre-teen know-howMost of the players reveiwing is playing this as a full release. It isnt. It is an unfinished alpha. Things change all the time and things will keep to change all the time until release. The fact that people play it as a full game eventhough it is indeed an alpha, shows the true potential.It is a nieche game, not many maritime games out there, very few of them has a high realism. Naval Action attempt to equally balance gameplay with historical realism and i think they succeed very well. It will be very interesting to try the final product with 2000+ players.I think a price is fair, but i think the current price is abit too high for a game in alpha stage. Id like to see price cut about half (or more) and then increased at release. I understand that it cost money to develop a game but this you dev-guys knew all along, dont make people pay with their own money to help you test your game... :)It is the best sailing game currently.

								Simply put this game is the most visually engrossing game of this genre and era I have ever played. And I have played most if not all naval action type game from the very early days such as Age of Sails I & II, Man of War, Age of Pirates, Pirates of the Burning Sea, etc. The atmosphere is astonishing and the battles are visually intoxicating. Never before have I seen such realistic renditions of gunfire as this. From thundering broadsides to fires on deck and exploding ships of war, toppling masts and boarding ships, it’s all there in marvellously detailed fleet actions. The graphics are truly impressive.There are dozens of ships all of which are beautifully detailed and rendered. From the Great ships of the line to elegant Frigates to Indiaman and Schooners and Sloop traders. The dynamics of Ships at sea is mesmerizingly portrayed. The Sea battles are quite simply enthralling. There is PVE and PVP and no shortage of action. Realm versus Realm comes into its own, each vying for control of The Caribbean. The Pacific will be added in due course. The game is still very much in development but most of the mechanics are there albeit that they need some tweaking. One must accept that not all mechanics will work perfectly straight off the bat.The UI is generic at this stage and does not aid with immersion…but give it some time…its coming.The Crafting and Rules of Engagement are still in flux and has caused some frustration. The Devs have applied allot of content suggested by the players, some good some bad. They have vowed to keep what works and trash what doesn’t.Perhaps the Devs should listen less to the community and follow their own vision more. Considering the effort they have put into this game thus far, I have no doubt that by release date this will be a solid engrossing game encompassing the Great Age of Sail.If you love the Age of Sail, the great Ships of the Line and the Romance of the Sea, I would not hesitate to highly recommend this game to you.

								Technically this game reminds me of Flight simulator X on sea. You have depth and possibilities of gameplay and it's not easy to get into, but if you perservere with it (which I have not) I believe there are rewardings to be found here. However at it's current state, the game has a steep curve to get into, very basic graphics and in general everything happens in slow motion. However the slowness is due to the simulation aspect of the game and does not differ from fsx in that respect. I mean your'e supposed to sail the sea, not fast travel it. I feel this will be a game for the experienced players and niche market, which as with fsx or other sims, is not bad thing at all. It's still getting patches and releases so the devs are at least doing something with this. I sure hope it will see a finished day someday and then I'm happy to take another look at it.There are severe annoyances that the community has been griping about for ages so lets hope the devs pick up on that one, such as the possibility for newbie players wait for experienced players to battle to death and then at last minute a newbie joins in and loots the shipwreck right before the winners noses or similar. Takes the wind off from playing competetively, and right now that's basically the playerbase this game has at the moment. Only curious and hardcore are willing to put up with this game's raw state of development. For these reasons I would advise to wait before getting this game, unless of course your'e that type of person.			"

								The sailing engine and graphics are incredible. Some facets of gameplay are still very much in flux but the devs are participating daily in the suggestion and bug report forums. They don't always respond to tester feedback, but it is obvious from changes seen in the game that they are listening.It is completely playable with few issues that I would classify as anything more than nuisances.The UI is functional but crude. The devs are waiting for the feature set to solidify more before devoting time and effort to a polished version. So don't be put off by the appearances of the menus. They are simply to provide control during testing.			"

								The game is more MMO than say a World of Warships and it's not play to win in any way.  All good right?  No it has no end game besides faction battle on the PvP servers between factions, none on the PvE side at all.  Crafting in game is the same formula used 20 years ago.  So what you have is an MOBA  pretending to be an MMO with limited arena battles, all battle are instanced.  Gets dull after about 100 hours of play.On PvP it's already devolved into a few Mega clans that work together mostly doing PvE battle vs NPC cities.The game is one of the best looking Unity engine games to date but, it's never going to blow your mind and like all Unity games it makes your GPU work harder than it should for what you get.If that is enough to buy it, you will be happy otherwise move on.

								The battles were much to slow, it was quite boring from the first battle i had, me vs 1 other, same boat, we must have hit eachother like 200 times each before i just gave up and let my ship sink. Also i found the open world to be very unimpressive, boats are too fast, no crew, the UI is meh, and not a tutorial or hint in sight.The graphics were lackluster in open world, however they are pretty awesome in battles if you have a strong computer and dont mind 40ish fps.Now i understand that this is Early access, but as of now unless your REALLY interested in the game and dont mind paying 40 dollars to be a beta tester i wouldnt reccomend getting this. The game does however have a ton of potential so i will more than likely try this game again in the future when its released. "

								The community of dedicated players is filled with outstand individuals, and the devlopers have been fantastic when it comes to both responding to player advice and ensuring the game is being updated on time and with reliable amounts of content. However they can be unprofessional when it comes to critiscm, in that they withhold content as a way to punish people that are critical of their work. 8/10, will probably play again (It's a great game, but the gods get angry very easily)			"

								Ok so 22 hours playing time in.Before I bought this game I read a lot of reviews and read the forums. It seem there are a lot of veteran players that are not happy with the developers of this game. These players are always moaning about changes from like a year ago and the reviews they have left dont reflect this game at all. This can happen when a game has been in alpha for a while a group of players can think they own it and get upset when it goes in a different direction.(sour grapes I think).This is potentially an awesome age of sail game!It looks beautiful, and the combat is awesome. At the moment the developers are changeing the economy and balancing it out. these older players dont seem to like this because it means a resources wipe. But the Developers are NOT wiping XP!! So thats great for an Alpha game development team surely. Because of this I will invest my time and if they make changes my progess wont be lost!! Awesome!!So this is an unfinished Alpha game and will change and develop. I dont get why these players give bad reviews like this. They nearly put me off but other players were arguing that they were biased and the reviews all looked to me a bit angry and fake, liked they were written by the same guy lol.I  have watched some threads on the forum where the same players who gave this game bad reviews are still playing it !! They whinge and whinge at every change the developers announce and seem to want to stop what the developers are trying to do. These players are acting like spoilt children. Ignore them and make your own mind up. Im am glad I did.One tip, the UI is basic and there is no official tutorial, but there are lots of youtube tutorials which explain this game easily and the community is friendly mostly. I would start as either GB or USA if you speak english. Pirates arent realy pirate but are a kind of a nation as well and seem to be disadvantaged quite a bit in this game. I would avoid starting as a pirate until the pirates become better defined.Remember this is an EA game and there will be changes. If you not sure about that wait for the full release.			"

								One of the few games I can stream to my TV and my wife can watch.   The ship fighting is great fun.   And I'm not really that good.   The nice thing is that you don't have to be an expert at combat to have fun.    You can run traders, buy low / sell high - hire a small fleet of light ships to screen your traders if attacked.    All that said, this is not a game for a young person looking for a quick shooter with waves of enemies.   At it's best the combat requires precise tactics, good timing, and thinking ahead.    The UI is not done.   and many mechanics are not implemented yet.    I try alot of games, and this is definitely in the top 15% of early games I've picked up on steam.			"

								Nearly 40 euro. You get thrown into the game without any real idea about what to do or even how to do it. Couldn't even get refund after only playing for an hour. Can't say I would recommend it in it's current state. Only wish I could get my money back.EDIT:Ok sorry, I wrote that in a hurry. I'm not mad about not getting the refund. It's more about them charging 40 euros for a EARLY ACCESS game. For 40 euro's I expected a whole lot more from this than it currently has to offer.I mean, I'm sure they will (hopefully) make a good game out of this and then I already own it since I can't refund. I'm simply saying: DON'T BUY IT RIGHT NOWI will of course keep an eye on it, especially since I can't refund and may eventually change this review to a thumbs up.			"

								Before I bought this game I read a review about how this game isn't being handled properly in Early Access. In my opinion this game is too early access. When you are docked and look at the main screen it is nothing but a solid blue background with menus all over the place. There is no tutorial at all so you have no idea what is what and what does what. When you leave port yes you are able to control your ship but even though I was using a small one it felt like it was moving too fast to be real. As for the map the game goes for a realistic way to use the map as in you aren't shown where you are on it. All of this within 12 minutes of game time. I would say let this one sit till it improves.			"

								If you are a fan of any sailing combat game then this game is an absolute must have. It provides a whole map of opportunity. If you don;t want to test or see the unfinished game then simply wait for release.This game is still in testing. Many negative reviews I have read seem to be by players complaining that the game isnt finished, well of course it isn't finished it hasn't reached launch date yet ! If you bouhgt the game early it was to put money into the development, gain a 'Testing position' if you wanted it and a freebie or three at launch.There are currently PVE and PVP servers setup for the testers to populate. The game has been designed to immerse the player in accurate combat simulation from the age of sail. Great ship Models, Wind and sailing effects. Changeable weather. Detailed and very agreeable firing and damage system.In addition to the combat the game gives the opportunity for trading, in depth crafting of ships, consumables and ship upgrades modules. Rank advancement of you as the captain and personal development of your 1st officer to add depth to your tactical style. Opportunity to take part in port battles for ownership of ports and resources, open map warfare where a mixture of player squadrons or solo ships can engage each other. International treaties between player nations. Missions and AI squadrons for those more pve aligned.Ship combat is excellent, visual from the deck, telescope or the crows nest view, control, models, real sailing and damage systems give this game a huge thumbs up. I won't even mention the effect a sub-woofer produces when a 1st rate fires off a broadside.  Ships can be upgraded with modules but within reason giving you a slight style of ship without 'magic' or unrealistic benefits.The Devs are always open about their plans and timelines and achieve most milestones as well as listening to their player base when feedback can and does influence game content and mechanics.As testers the current player base can still see areas of improvement all of which are on the Devs ""To Do"" list prior to release. My only mini gripe whish is far outweighed by the many positives, is that although set in the Caribbean I do feel I am usually sailing up a foggy and muggy English channel. More sunlight and bright skies are to be hoped for in the future.I wish Game Labs well and am pleased I have been able to have so much time and fun in the game as a tester which far exceeds my usual time spent in a full release game. Bring on the Final Launch, looking forward to adding another 1100 hours. :)			"

								Steep price for an early access game but I am loving it. Now if some of the more overtly sensitive community members don't screw it up with weird suggestions like sea monsters or restrictions for this and restrictions for that, it can only get better. If this game needs one thing, it is even more freedom and tactical possibilities for all players and factions and not some strange battle restrictions that break immersion because somebody doesn't want to lose 1 durability point on their beloved ship of the line to a gang of scurvy pirates. Pirates do piraty things when the opportunity arises. National fleets act like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥to the pirates and gank them when they can. That's the way it's supposed to be. What i am missing though is the ability for nations to hire pirates or form alliances with them although i have read something about new diplomatic possibilites in one of the coming updates.The game mechanics are nice. You have a lot of control over your ship from sails to masts to crew to cannons and so on. and there are many ways to make money including ship building and fishing, which is quite underrated in my opinion. A perfect gateway for new players to enter the world of trade and nice method for making some quick money at lower levels.The graphics look so nice at some points of the game that i find myself just sitting there an staring at the screen and pressing F12 10 times in a row. Oh and there is no music, only soothing ocean and weather sounds. So grab your shanty or reggae folder or maybe some contemporary classical music. My suggestions: Horace Andy, Boccherini, Stan Rogers			"

								10/10 Booted up game.Joined friend in a glorius first time skirmish.Got mounted by another boat.The mounting boat capsized.Preceded to get broadsided by a frigate. Somehow survived the engagement.  Long spiel: The game mechanics are quite solid for an early access alpha game, ship battles are fun, and the graphics are quite amazing.

								Naval Action... It’s like flying a plane in water. What’s that? Planes don’t fly in water?I don’t know what’s real anymore. I've been lost at sea for the past few days... or was it weeks... Good thing the wind never changes direction... I'm bound to hit land eventually if I just keep following the wind.No matter how long you are lost at sea, it really doesn’t matter, because ships in this game are truly exceptional. As is the naval combat system. The oceanic environment and wind direction shapes the course of a battle and keeps each match interesting, which is just as well as even a small battle can last upwards of half an hour. As unpolished as this game may be in its current early alpha state, it is still worth looking at. "

								I enjoy the game.  I joined a clan, help new people in general chat with questions about gameplay and do a lot a trading/crafting.  I play PVE b/c PVP is not well balanced yet.  Fleet actions with friends are a lot of fun.  The graphics are beautiful and the ships have individual characteristicss.  They caan be customizable with add-on mods too.  When on long sails I play sea-chanties and period music and stuff from the Master and Commander soundtrack.  Lots of friendly folks (at least as Britain in PVE).  I recommend it.			"

								I am hooked on this game. I've been gaming for decades and most games bore me these days. I was down to only one game I felt was worth playing until I found Naval Action. Graphics are awesome. Ship battles are very realistic. The map is HUGE and quite a lot of fun to navigate. This is a great game for those who love huge sandbox games and a pvp environment. Give it a try. I promise you'll be glad you did. Oh, there are 7 factions to choose from. We USA players would love to have you with us but if not each faction has many great players to help you get started.12/4/16: A quick update on the game. I've left the US Navy and joined the Royal British Navy due to problems with enemy faction players constantly hunting noobies on the East Coast. I'm a Flag Captain now and pretty well established in the British Navy. This game is still a MASTERPIECE. Do yourself a favor and disregard any negative reviews. Now, yes, it is a very time consuming game. If you are looking for a quick bang bang fps like WOT, COD, etc then this is not for you. It's an intricate SANDBOX naval game somewhat akin to EVE but without the ridiculous point and click operation of your ship. The graphics on this game are superior to most games on the market. Also,  I'll add that this game is more suited for the mature gamer. There are very few teenagers playing Naval Action. To give you an idea, I'm 46 and I'm just about in the middle age range for Naval Action. It's an intricate, strategical, substantial learning curve, sandbox game which caters to the adult mentality. This game is just not for the instant gratification immature mind. If any devs happen to read this review my only request for now is that you make the paints accessible via crafting and/or drops from AI ships.  Thank you.			"

								Okay, so, let me throw out some context for this review:The reviews here are mostly negative. So much so, that when I bought the game, I literally set a timer while playing to make sure I didn't exceed the max play time before I could get my money back. THAT'S how bad I expected this to be from the reviews. I was pleasantly surprised. Most of the negative reviews recently have been due to interaction with the devs. I can't speak on that as I'm not on the forums, so I have no real community exposure. I was brought to Naval Action because I've always loved the age of sail. I previously bought Assasings Creed IV just for the sailing ships. It was fine, but the inability to really change your ship was frustrating. Then I bought Tempest, which was okay, but not really pretty, and not very clear. I decided to give Naval Action a try. Now, the interface is poor at best. It looks like the 1990s. It's a bit sad. There is no tutorial, so, good luck figuring out what you're supposed to actually DO or how to do it. Fortunately for the devs, there are enough people in game willing to help explain things that it's not unplayable. But they should probably do something about that, because they can't rely on their playerbase to do everything for them. Then there's the graphics. This game is gorgeous, no question. Additionally, I really enjoy that it's not just point and click warfare. You think about the wave motion, the winds, you can't instant-stop... it's a VERY enjoyable game if you simply love sailing ships. Don't get this if you want a quick-click arcade pirate warlord game, but if you have a passion for sailing ships, it's worth the buy!			"

								Really neat game alot of time and effort has been put  by dev team to make the game really feel like you are at the open sea. It looks and feels great but there is alot of room for improvement. The rescent armor patches has made alot of dota players mad because they canot sink ships from far away but ships didnt sink quickly in combat and took concentrated fire and team work. I think these guys in a year will have a near perfect game but Rome wasnt built in a day. Almost monthly big content and many smaller in between patches.. It really is a nice mmo with mix of realism/ease of use. Can only hope it makes it to its final potential!			"

								Alltogether not worth it!The game has some good points:- Its the only ""new"" sailing game- Fighting other ships is pretty strategic- Huge map- You can conquer other nation's harboursBut in my opinion, the downsides are too huge and I would give it back if I had not played for more than 2 hrs already:- Trading doesnt work except you write down all the prices every harbour pays- No other (working) features but to fight (PVP or PVE)- Ridicolous price (37€ as im writing this)- Ship control is not as ""Simulation"" as you might think from the videos- Only 1 Type of mission (which I have discovered) so far: leave harbour-kill/conquer ship- done- Ugly menusWhat I would love to see in order to make the price fair:- more beautiful menus- Proper Trading options- More different gameplay features (exploring, fishing, finding stuff, transportation, passengers, whatever)- An option to have a ""Free camera"" and a camera that allows you to see where you hit your enemy- More information on the ships hitboxes, I still havent found out if i can destroy rudders or not....I will keep watching this game and see. If it gets better, I'll change this review.			"

								So, having played this game for a while i must say, for me it is THE game. Gorgeous graphics, fantastic sailing, dream ship battles. (my new hobby is making screenshots).The thing with the different numbers of nation members and the struggle of the british Empire is because of the living and dynamic nature of the game. It depends on us players, we are free to decide the fate of our nation.A message to the devs, hold your course, steady. Because finally there is a MMO that is not a typical MMO. It´s a special one for special people.And to the special people: Sign on, climb the rankes, get a 3rd Rate and help us defeat the damn pirates. Godspeed.			"

								A great game with a ton of potential!  POTBS fans will love it as well as those with an interest in naval history.  If the game has any flaws its that its UI is a little bland (which will change) and its a little on the slow side at times.  Also Servers do need to be a bit larger.  Other than that combat is great and its totally based on skill, no magic buttons giving buffs or debuffs.  The only way to best an enemy is with your skill and skill alone.  Players will need learn marksmenship, sailing, and navigation skills if they are to strive in this version of the Carribean.  Econ is complex, with player made ships being better than what is sold by default in the shops.  The AI are intelligent sailors with plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the map is massive! Also conquest is a thing with nations fighting over ports for resource control.  And if raising the Black Flag is more your thing Pirate is an option.  Beautiful ships and locations with adventure and danger at every turn.  There are no pvp zones and pvp can happen anytime, anywhere.TLDR: 9/10 has a ton of promise and a great naval Sandbox			"

								First, we must remember that this an early access game. That means, in case you didnt know, this game is not feature complete. There are serveral additions and changes that will be made to this game in as development continues.That being said, I have been with this game since the closed Beta and it is simply amazing! This is an age of sail simulator, not an arcade game. First off, the visuals are amazing especially in battle. Second, the audio is even more intense. The sounds of cannon fire echoing accross the sea so immersive with sound travel and echoes all incorporated. It is tough to sink a ship. They do take a beating so dont expect a quick PVP battle. If you are lucky you will hit a powder store and send the thing into a million splintering pieces. Its also a challenge to maneuver the ship while accounting for sea swells and direction and strenght of the wind. The UI is a bit confusing but that is easily remedied by asking your team what each thing means. The commnity is extremely supportive. Also, prepare to devote a few hours to each time you play because not only will a battle last a while but it takes, at times, an hour or so to sail from one port to another depending on where you go. All in all, this game is great. Its still being worked on but what is already featured in beautiful with only better things to come. If you want a quick, easy, point and click ship game then dont buy this. Play World of Warships or something. This is for those who want to relive the days of Master and Commander and appreciate the complexity of Age of Sail combat on the open seas.			"

								Great game all around so far as its still early access ive seen the game change progressively since i started in Feb. Pvp is very addicting as theres not much that can compare to crafting your own ship be it a wooden wall, frigate or sloop of war then taking your best design of stats/buffs/perks you can create into war agianst countless foes just remember no ship last forever... it has a great competitive pvp zone once you hit late and friendly player base that will just about spoil you with everything if you just ask, as they are nice they are equally hardened to war and there is no casual on the pvp server. i recommend to anyone looking for a pvp game that get you in the action right away but stays creative with custom variables. I enjoy Pve every once in a awhile its very enjoyable but i prefer a head to head fight with another person. So i will leave Pve to other reviews or your own personnel exp if you choose to play. 8/10 on ships,combat,players,orignal.			"

Realism is high, lots of new content to test every month. Having a blast.Fair warning though, the game requies quite a lot of time every time you sit down to play.			"

								First, we must remember that this an early access game. That means, in case you didnt know, this game is not feature complete. There are serveral additions and changes that will be made to this game in as development continues.That being said, I have been with this game since the closed Beta and it is simply amazing! This is an age of sail simulator, not an arcade game. First off, the visuals are amazing especially in battle. Second, the audio is even more intense. The sounds of cannon fire echoing accross the sea so immersive with sound travel and echoes all incorporated. It is tough to sink a ship. They do take a beating so dont expect a quick PVP battle. If you are lucky you will hit a powder store and send the thing into a million splintering pieces. Its also a challenge to maneuver the ship while accounting for sea swells and direction and strenght of the wind. The UI is a bit confusing but that is easily remedied by asking your team what each thing means. The commnity is extremely supportive. Also, prepare to devote a few hours to each time you play because not only will a battle last a while but it takes, at times, an hour or so to sail from one port to another depending on where you go. All in all, this game is great. Its still being worked on but what is already featured in beautiful with only better things to come. If you want a quick, easy, point and click ship game then dont buy this. Play World of Warships or something. This is for those who want to relive the days of Master and Commander and appreciate the complexity of Age of Sail combat on the open seas.			"

								A great game with a ton of potential!  POTBS fans will love it as well as those with an interest in naval history.  If the game has any flaws its that its UI is a little bland (which will change) and its a little on the slow side at times.  Also Servers do need to be a bit larger.  Other than that combat is great and its totally based on skill, no magic buttons giving buffs or debuffs.  The only way to best an enemy is with your skill and skill alone.  Players will need learn marksmenship, sailing, and navigation skills if they are to strive in this version of the Carribean.  Econ is complex, with player made ships being better than what is sold by default in the shops.  The AI are intelligent sailors with plenty of tricks up their sleeves and the map is massive! Also conquest is a thing with nations fighting over ports for resource control.  And if raising the Black Flag is more your thing Pirate is an option.  Beautiful ships and locations with adventure and danger at every turn.  There are no pvp zones and pvp can happen anytime, anywhere.TLDR: 9/10 has a ton of promise and a great naval Sandbox			"

								Amazing game. I have followed this game since it was first released as a PVP/PVE battles only game with 1 type of ship. I have watched it grow and only get better until it is now released as a Open World MMO. It is an incredible and beautiful game where you can do what you wish, when you wish and however you wish. Start off small however immediately have the ability to grow into the biggest threat on the ocean. You choose your path! Whether that be an officer in the Navy or a pirate sailing the carribean. I recommend this game to everyone, not only those who have a vast interest in this era of ship warfare and sailing.			"

								I have always been fascinated by the great wooden ships that sailed the seven seas. So when i first saw this game I was so hyped to jump onto the deck of a frigate and plunder the caribbean.The game looks and sounds great, with high level of detail and realism. But the game has a steep learning curve and if you're either not interested or dedicated to learn the mechanics you can easily get bored or frustrated.Personally I love the game and I would recommend to anyone that loves the Age of Sail or someone that wants a challenging but fun adventure!

								Awesome game! I have had the pleasure of being a part of the closed alpha for over a year now, and have sunk well over 600 hours into the game so far. Every hour of this was spent having fun. Whether this be from hunting down players, trading resources for some extra money, to just hunting some AI. The game is also great when you pair up with some of the clans in game and have huge battles where almost anything can happen. Naval Action also has one massive thing going for itself, the devs actually listen to the community. With them taking advice, polls, and reports from normal players.Pros: Graphics are stunning.Battles are intense and are quite fun.Battles require strategy and thought.HUGE open world map. (over 250 ports)Crafting ships and upgrades.PVP combat/Clan Combat.REAL sailing (i.e. tacking and controlling your own yards/masts)Cons: Some battles can take a while. (most of my battles are close to 15-30 minutes, this can be an issue for some people.Can require a hefty computer to run the game.Updates take some time.Game can stand to be optimized to run better.Steep learning curve and no real guide/tutorial out currently.In all, I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who has a love for sailing, strategy, MMO’s, and vehicle combat. Just be aware that the game is still in early access, and some elements of the game are not completed yet. "

Early Access Review
								This game is AMAZING. This game has everything you want if you want to have a more realistic touch to being a captain of your own ship. I am going to get right down to the point of why this game is amazing.Pros-Captain your ship, your way. You can choose to be a faction or be a pirate. Some of the factions are the French, the Spanish, the Dutch and the Americans. There are several others as well. If you want to be a factionless person you can be  a pirate and kill anyone, but that goes double for you as you can be killed by a fellow pirate and any other faction in the game.PVP and PVE. New to the game? Not to worry. There is a PVE mode where you can join up with people and learn from them as you fight AI ships which can give you a run for your money. There is also a PVP mode (Of which I cannot cover as I haven't done that yet.)Realistic damage. The damage to your ship does affect what happens. More damage equals more holes and easier to shoot grape shot (To kill crew) into that side. Chain shot can destroy sails with ease and slow you down, making you a sitting duck for cannon shot. MIssions and free roam. In this game, you start with a basic cutter class, the lowest of the low. In the start you can't exactly go up against a high level ship such as a frigate and expect to win. To rank up you need to do missions against the AI and get money and XP. Doing this will help you get to your next ship and buy your guns for it. There is a lot of goods, to many to name off in fact but the game does have some minor gripes.Cons-Teleport. There is a teleport system in the game that does send you back to your capital city. Now this is optional keep in mind and you don't HAVE to use it, but this is a gripe because...WHY IS IT IN THIS GAME?! I understand people might get lost or confused in the game but thats part of the fun of being in a time when GPS or things like map markers don't help. The fun is the adventure and the thought of finding yourself fighting a high skilled enemy because you don't know where you are. Confusing at first. Once you join the game it thrusts you into it without any real indication of what you are supposed to do. It kind of just gives you a menu and says ""Have at it"" Which isn't bad but in a game like this, you need a tutorial or some help leaning about it. While it isn't impossible to learn by yourself, I suggest youtube or guides on how to start first before you do anything.These are only a few gripes and of course as it is Early Access, things are going to change. The UI could use some spit and polish, perhaps even a reboot, but it isn't exactly impossible to use. All in all, the game is great to play and fun to just shoot each other.YO HO HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM! CAST THE SAILS AND SWAB THE DECK! WE GO TO SINK THE SPANISH MAIN! YAR!			"

								Sorrry but do not buy this game.  The devs really do not have anything except instance fighting.  You spend hours travelling and have to wait for everything.  If you dont have 4 hours to play in a straight line then dont bother.  If you are not playing when the timers set by people half way around the world for their play time then dont bother cause you cant take their ports or fight them.The Devs put in pinata type gimmicks to get players to play at certain times and get prizes but they lost the entire effect of a Naval Fleet combat games.  They put in fictitious borders that sink you ship that you spent hours getting the money to buy because you are trying to disengage.  But they forget to tell everyone ... Reallly I have played this game many hours and it never gets any better.. It just keep having little tweaks put into that make no sense.  The Devs do not know what a naval game should do.

								Great Game - still in PVE mode - Getting the basics down before I try PVP. I am very happy with the details and graphics. The XP progression is slow but not daunting. Gold can be leveraged very easily with trade but that is a complex system. I like the crafting/manufacturing phases. There are so many things to do and so little time! LOL. I highly reccommend this game to anyone who is looking for a relaxing game experience with periods of intense struggle. It is not a fast action game - the nature of seaborne conflict dictates long periods of low activity interspersed with extremely intense and fast action. May you have fair winds and following seas.

								This is a great game! The graphics are excellant. The game has many aspects to it and a hugh map to explore the Caribbean in. For some they may not like the time it takes to accomplish different goals. Yes it takes time and that is the beauty of the game. There are two versions PvE and PvP. Both use the same Map but the aspects are totally different. For those who enjoy a solo/casual environment the PvE provides this for you. Thoses who want a contest against live people the PvP is there for that as well. Clan operation or RvR works in the PvP environment.This is still in alpha testing, so it takes time to learn how it works as there is no offical instruction on how to play. The experience you gain by hit or miss in tactics and sailing in the wind will teach you plenty.  It is not a star wars game either where everything happens in milli-seconds. There are times it takes a while to find and chase down your target for battle. There are other time you get together to conduct a Port Battle. All the battles take time to complete, you cannot be in a hurry.It's Wooden Ships and Iron Men in 3d graphical world that is second to none.			"

								Game needs work. Aside from the fact that there is no tutorial or anything of the sort, here is my experience in starting this game.I created a character, picked a mission from the starting town, went out to fight the (very first!) mission boat, and the game sets me up against a ship with twice the crew and guns that I have. Using some experience in the automatching battles and the youtube tutorials I watched, I was able to disable the enemy ship to the point that it could not move. This process took around half an hour. This is a very slow paced game. So, while the enemy ship was disabled on my horizon, a black dot rolling in the waves, i took shot after carefully aimed shot. For probably 45 minutes. The guns are horribly inaccurate, so it was a crap shoot if one in 6 shots could even land. There was no discernable difference in the enemy ship (which was not moving, mind you) so I crept in a little closer, taking more shots. Hitting a few every now and again. Eventually the enemy ship I guess was still slightly moving, and then it swung wide and fired a broadside from a considerable distance (where i was having trouble landing even 1 in 6 shots) and hit almost if not all of two twelve gun broadsides, making my ship take on water and then sink. After ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around trying to plink this allegedly level 1 AI for AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES.What even is that balance? What on earth were they thinking? Game is completely unplayable without grinding out pvp battles for hours on end before even starting the game. And even then, balance is clearly dubious at best. If an AI is immobile and a sitting duck being shot for multiple in game day/night cycles why does it not surrender??? This was such a frustrating experience that I have uninstalled the game. I may try again some other time but I really can't see wanting to put in the time investment.			"

								this is not a game for someone who does not like a very slowpaced game. the combat system is perfect if you want realism but for me turning and moving even in the original ship which is supposed to be fast was just way too tedious. the aiming with the cannons and the movement and such is very strategic and does not require any reaction time. if your looking for a timesink with superb realism go for it just not my type of game			"

On the cons side, they don't share much behind the scene so there is little info about dev roadmap or the end game plans; and that includes making hugely impactful changes during upgrades without much information. It can be pretty brutal. Though it is beta.Second, they managed to turn the ""open sea"" or ""open world"" experience into its own fun game. In most other similar games it's a boring map view to use to go from A to B. In this game it's a rich, immersive and deep experience. They turned it into a ""first ship-person perspective"" game complete with day/night cycles (beautiful sunsets and sunrises), weather and marine weather effects (you can come into view of a port and 20 seconds later it's disappeared again in the rising fog). You end up doing ""in your head"" fixes on coastlines, points and landmarks to run your dead-reckoning; and that is super fun (longing for devs to add a tool to take in game bearings instead of having us eyeball it, also being able to plot the Dead Reckoning on the chart would really add a whole new depth to Nav).In game and open sea physics are fantastic. Trading runs are fun due to the fine work they did with the open sea experience. Ship combat is incredible, deep, immersive and realistic, particularly the sailing and wind physics (it's possible to control the yard-arms to manually adjust the headsails and mainsails separately!!! ""backing the jib"" on a massive square rigger is quite fun.. :) )The Nation experience has its ups and downs, lots of paranoia around spies preventing Nation mechanics from working well. Players wanting to help end up excluded due to long sailing times and people not being forthcoming with port battle information. PVP is super fun.Crafting is ok, the UI is barebones, including the sliders to adjust crafting quantities. It's possible to be in a situation where you have just enough materials to craft the number of items you want but not more, but the slider won't allow you to set the number you need. I'm sure this issue will be resolved.Ship-crafting is already quite fun, I mean it's as boring as crafting is but they have a great system of building upgrades into the ship build itself, and a clever system of poat build upgrades (some being 'permanent' and some being removable). That means that shipbuilders/crafters can really make very specialized types of ships, and the design work behind that can be quite fun.The eye-candy is gorgeous, weather, sky and sun superb, firing broadsides is quite the visual show, the cloud of smoke from the canons then drifts off with the winds. You can really aim your broadsides, the aiming system is quite intuitive and effective. But the best part is that you can fire guns separately (ranging shots!), or in full broadside (front to back, back to front or random order). You can aim your fire shot by shot with round shot at their mast and actually take it down. The game has waves so if you don't pay attention, you can have your ship heeled by a wave just as you fire and all your shot ends up sky high or in the water by your ship. A wave can pass by the enemy ship as you fire and absorb half of your broadside. In this game, even gunning is an art.Boarding combat is kind of a lame little text UI (for now) but even then it's along the more fun boarding mini games (the Mount & Blade based one being my favorite for boarding).It's raw, it's more alpha than beta really. But I seadog-gone love it!! :)			"

								This game is great.This game has come a long way since I started playing it, but its gotten better after virutally every patch. The game is massive, I have not been to certain corners of the map (looking at you bermuda), there is always something to do. Its much better to play in groups; though it can be played by a single player, its much more interesting to hunt in small groups. Addtionally this game is stunningly beautiful, I am a history buff of the 20th century, and for a while I viewed some sailing ships as awkward comprimises, between technology, propulsion, and firepower. This has changed that, the ships are richly detailed, the ocean is beautiful, and you could spend a good bit of your time just looking at the ships, rather than sailing them. Overall this game does what it does with the utmost quality, and it isn't even done yet, the devs, though they appear to have a small team, work like slaves, turning patches about every month (the most recent one was a bit different because they combined the two (sept-oct) patches, but it changed/added enough to be equal to two if not more, so worth the exra wait.) Addtionally the devs interact with the community quite often, answering questions on the forums, and helping solve bugs etc. however they do have a tendancy to tease us, posting pictures of ships they are adding, or not being clear in certain parts of the patch notes. its all in good fun though so it could be worse. which brings me to the community side of things, some games can be detracted from by their community, the community hear is quite dedicated, helping newbies, and some even modeling ships to be added to the game, overall there is very few 'bad apples' compared to other games.So basically if you are looking for a game you can sink some serious time into, that is pretty, and has hours of content, and fathoms of depth, this may be the game for you. you do not nessacarily need to be a history buff to enjoy this game.

								The game appears intriguing, but it simply doesn't work. The developers have been aware that the rudder control for these ships is broken for over a year and have done nothing to fix it. The community has developed some work-arounds, with no support from the developers, but these only work inermittently. I appreciate this is early access, but this is a game-killer (imagine, a sailing simulation where you can't control your ship!) and the lack of any support is inexcusable. I should have reviewed the forums more carefully before I bought. I would recommend waiting until this issue has been fixed. In the meantime it sits on my shelf.			"

This game feels more like a tech demo, let me explain why. The naval combat part of this game is awesome with one exception: the boarding. Boarding is just a Rock, Paper Scissor spreadsheet of sorts. Sailing around the overmap looks pretty but is devoid of any activity. Music and a more indepth crew system would help a tremendous amount. This might include food/water managment and moral system similar to PIRATES!, and recruiting and assigning officers and crew individually similar to STO, and having a visual representation of being in port similar to World of Warships would help a tremendous amount. In its current state, this game is a great tech demo, but a poor game. Have hope though, its still in alpha.			"

								Pretty awesome mmo, but there is so much preventing pvp right now that I can't recommend it. Its impossible to steal player ships ( you only take 1 durability off their ship). There is invulnerability spells, invisibility spells, teleport spells, I was expecting a naval game not a fantasy one, I've seen ships disapear as your about to tackle them.. so much broken things preventing pvp. Some of the bigger ships take nearly 2 minutes to reload and you can just use teleport to leave battle instance before that. All the 'anti grief' pvp bullscat just encourages you to gang up on ppl to overcome the bullscat invisiblity, invulnerable sails for 2 minutes by using a sail repair so much nonsense..			"

BEFORE YOU PURCHASE ITHi guys, I just started playing this game early this morning and I want you guys to know that I got confused early on so I decided to ask for help using chat and what is awesome about this game is that the community really helps you and they aren't rude or the type that pisses you off. In addition, the naval battles are awesome but it kinda gets repetitive in the long run but still fun. Furthermore, this game is not for those who don't like to wait for too long or gets uncomfortable waiting for like your ship to arrive at a certain destination but is really rewarding for those who get overjoyed by getting a profit in trading goods(buying low, selling high). In conclusion, this game is not for all of you out there but I myself like the game very much because of 2 reasons which are:1.I have fun by making money as a trader2.Stealing cargo, destroying ships with friends.Bad aspects which is why I don't like the game.1. Toxic community and the bullying.2. In the PVP 2 USA server there's a lot of racism going on.3. The chat bans are not even used on the toxic people but those who are standing up for themselves.NOTE:The devs only care about your money and they won't care if they won't even provide a SAFE ENVIRONMENT for online gameplay.

								Game-Labs has made the impossible possible with this. A boring ship simulator, with even more boring combat. The ships are like sponges and can take an incredible amount of abuse before sinking. Meaning the fighting isn't as much a strategic game, as much as a who can fire the most shots in the shortes amount of time. The battles are done in instances rather than open world fights and the rewards for victories are disappointing to say the least. This has potential, but as is, is just a boring time sink...			"

								To all of you with hundreds, and some of you with thousands, of hours in this game and are still playing, who have given a bad review, you are complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥ and you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in your own bed.Bad reviews affect the game you numbskulls. Getting 'ganked' is not a reason for a bad review. Generally sucking at the game is not a reason for a bad review. You are ♥♥♥♥ing toddlers who literally cannot grasp the concept of a game in ALPHA phase, a WIP, that needs minor adjustments, or even major adjustments (all of which are not bugs but simply rules of engagment!)- and a truly BAD game worthy of a bad review.You are everything that is wrong with the millennial generation and if you are older than that, you should be ashamed of yourselves.If you are thinking about buying this game, do it. I have been gaming longer than most of you were old enough to play a video game, this is the only game I have put this many hours into, hands down.Go read 7-10 bad reviews and then look at the hours they have put into the game... that will tell you everything you need to know.There has never been an age of sail game even remotely like this. No, Assassins Creed is not similar, that is angry birds on a boat. This is the sweet spot between a full on sim and a damn good action game. You won't find another developer community like this one. I say that knowing their faults better than anyone.Buy the game.By the way, do you like sandbox open worlds? This is the biggest. 16 million square miles. Soon the Pacific will open up. You like crafting? You can build everything from gunpowder to the carriages for the cannons to the planking, frames and thousands of things more. You can buy and sell everything from Oregon beaver coats to sugar to tobacco to coal to ♥♥♥♥ing Dutch peanut butter.The combat is the kernel, it is what hooked many of us even before the open world was made. It's hard at first, but once you start to get the feel of it you'll be addicted. Besides that it is just downright gorgeous.			"

								This will be a long and detailed review, read if you'd like. I'd like to make it every clear to everyone reading this that this is an MMO still in Alpha, which means the game is far from complete so keep that in mind! Bugs and lack of content is included. On to the review..Having played Pirates of the Burning Sea for a couple of years, this game was pretty much a given for me. It felt like an updated version of that, just with more simulation aspects brought into it.Combat;Literally the best part of this game. The mechanics, the sound design, the visual effects, the challenges of sailing a ship, all of these makes the combat in Naval Action brilliant. Even NPCs can push your captain skills to the limit which is a nice take on PvE without making it super easy and utterly boring, all in all PvE is a great way to train before going into PvP.A battle at sea can also take quiet a bit of time. Even in my HMS Surprise, fighting two Snow's can take a good 20-30+ min. It's not a World of Warships game with fast in and out combat. Keep this in mind.Open World Sailing;This is where it will all depend on you, the player. The West Indies which goes all the way from South America to North Charleston and beyond is truly big. You will spend most of your time in-game sailing to wherever you need to go, as the map is scaled very big, going to somewhere that looks close on the map is not that close after all and will take a while. You could always stick with missions close to your port but after a while, you will eventually want to branch out to the unknown.Navigating;When I mentioned simulation aspects, I really meant it. You are only given a map with coordinates and a compass to aid your way. Zooming in on the map gives you a grid view which shows you the different degrees for each grid as well as your own potision in terms of degrees. From there, you have to look where your mission is and use the compass plus the grid to find your way to the mission. No map markers, no waypoints. Just you, the compass and a map. Some will hate this, some will enjoy it.PvE; The only form of PvE is very bareboned at the current moment in the game's state. You have Combat Orders which can be accepted from any port of your own nation. These combat orders are randomly created sea fights where you pick the level of difficulty and the county you want thr battle to be in, rewards are decent and enough and very enjoyable. Supply Deliveries are just that, an assignment to deliver certain types of good to a port for good profit, very time consuming and the goods you need to deliver you have to pay for. PvE Challenges are also there for those who want to test their skills tho can be hard to tackle at the beginning stages.I haven't touched PvP and RvR as of yet, but once I do this review will be updated to include my general impressions from that aswell. My general impressions are overall positive. The game sure lacks alot in it's current state but it's important to remember it's still in Alpha and it has alot to come for the future. With my 35 in-game hours as of writing this review, I've met nothing but good and friendly people willing to help out newcomers to the game, both on the PvP servers and PvE server.Is it for you? Depends if you enjoy games where you are supposed to spend alot of time grinding and sailing. Being stuck with one ship for a long time is a given for this game, being able to pilot the bigger ships do indeed take alot of time. If you have the time for a game like this and enjoy naval warfare from this era, do indeed pick it up. If you are looking for a game where you can hop in quick, get alot of kills and xp this is not the game for you.			"

								The game is Very entertaining and  the combat is very fun.. that being said finding missions is extremely difficult.you could spend an hour just finding a mission or maiting out a storm caus eyou cant find you X in the fog If you use profanity you will have your chat privaledges revoked. If you play Naval Action you are bound to sets of rules not posted inside the game. The devs will make up rules instead of fixing in game issues and punish the player base for mistakes they have made rather than fixing it. WHEN YOU PURCHASE THIS GAME YOU MUST REGULARLY CHECK INTO A GARBAGE FORUM(not in steam) OR RISK GETTING BANNED FOR THINGS THE GAME ALLOWS. If you are disliked in the game you can be brought on charges in a biased 3rd party ""tribunal"" and receive a ban. I have never in my life seen a game that you must frequently check changing rules that are not posted in the game. I like the game and will play it in the future but currently it is not worth $56 CAD to play 2 seperatly games... forum pvp and open sea pvp.The DEV's And Moderators in this game are very ""if you dotn play nice with others youll get banned"" kinda typesCurrently in the process of trying to recive a refund......Dev's and Mods will strip your rank and gold for no reason. they say you get warning befor ehand but you will not.Please check out http://forum.game-labs.net/ and read alot of info befor you purchase this game or well you may not end up being able to play vem tho you bought it untill actuall release day.

								Not enough content to justify $40. Dev's ""suggest"" I change my name because it does not meet standards, however once a character is made name changes are not possible without deleting the single player you have created. Not much of a suggestion to ask a player to do something they cannot do. Community is back stabbing, pirates will attack their own kind for profit. Community is toxic. Guild's should be renamed ""I would but"" squads since everyone always finds an excuse to not fight or back up fellow players. Connection drops while in battle causing you to lose high value ships. Wait for this to hit the bargain bin.			"

								This game should be about naval strategy and tactics. Living life on the ocean. Finding quarry and pursuing it, and instead finding yourself at the mercy of a better ship and needing to flee. Dealing with situations like that is what I wanted. Instead, this game is mostly about doing missions and grinding XP so you can get a better ship. You are stuck in the worst ship (quite literally) for ages, grinding up small amounts of XP until you can adequately crew a less terrible ship. At which point you'll begin a longer grind for another less terrible ship. At which point you'll do it again, etc. The problem with progression like this is that for one, it limits options. It creates a linear path for Captains to follow that is inescapable, and this game purports to be about options. The second problem with this is that if every player can eventually captain any ship, there's no reason to have smaller ships. Players will only ever consider themselves viable when they're able to captain the largest ships, because that's the cap, and indeed, those ships are better suited to a fight. If every player can reach cap and get the best ships, all you'll have are the best ships; why would anyone come to a fight without the best? And the third issue I take with this is that the first couple of Ranks simply aren't fun. Nor are they thoughtful. They do not present you with a feeling of advancement (from your Midshippman to Ensign Ranks which require hourse of work you can have a max of 40, then 60 crew, which is so slight an advantage as to be laughable). They just aren't enjoyable, and I don't have any desire to put any number of hours into a game so that it becomes enjoyable. A game must be learned of course, especially if it has any depth. But you will learn Naval Action and still find that there are hours left before you can do anything worthwhile.I will refuse to propose a solution here because this is a review. And in review I'd say that there are a few advantages to having a multiplayer-only game. The first is the living economy. The second is that it creates multiple layers of interaction. But the downside of all this is that to prevent uniformity in players, a scale of progression must be established. Unfortunately the implementation in Naval Action is bland, uninspired, and hopelessly repetitive. It is worse that because of it, you are so limited in your available activities, and worse still in that it forces obsolescence onto every ship you captain until you reach the apex of progression.If you are looking for a game about sailing and fighting and privateering in an open world, my advice is to Follow this game if you are interested, and see how or if it changes. I would not advise a purchase.			"

								Please note this is Early Access game:Pros:*Very nice battles and graphics.* Potential to be a VERY good game IF the devs listen to the players feedback.   if not this game will fail big time.Cons:NO character creation. Right now they only have a player name you can pick, you get exp and money... but no character to walk around with.NO walking around in ports or your ship..(this sadly makes me feel i dock in a port to open a badly made and uggly menu...booring...) lol not even a background.. its all gray....The names on the ports on the world map feels...wrong....There is very little MMO feeling when you dont even have a character to walk around with on your ship or ports.Feedback to help the devs/game.The devs are really good at graphics so i am sure if they want to they can make character creation, ports that you can move around in and walk into a shop or tavern etc, this will also remove the uggly menu and add MMO feeling to the game.  try add so players can walk around on their ship. maby to have a room were players can talk and plan before a battle.The XP to gain new lvls is crazy korean grinding...it takes a looong time.. so your stuck in your newbe cutter ship for DAYS. you can handle a crew of 40 as a new player..  next rank is only 60....then i gess 80. 100. 120 ..but to gain next ship you need a crew of 120 ... it takes a looong time.....so please dont scare the players away with extreme xp grind...more players at endgame big ships = more fun for everyone. !  =)Untill they fix the ports, character creation, the uggly Port Menu , Dubble the xp gain,  i cant recommend this to anyone.

								very interesting game. The main sailing engine is clearly very well put together, combat is fun and rewarding. However, this game is still very alpha atm, there is no artwork for any of the menus and the UI overall is a bit rough to use. There is also no tutorial or explanation of anything in game so your success will be dictated by your familiarity of similar titles as much as anything else. Interested to see where development takes this, but currently not something that should be recomended for the average user.			"

								I'm standing at the bow of my fierce HMS Surpise, I'm chasing down a French Le Gros Ventre filled to the brim with loot, she's running deep, and I'm slowly gaining on her. I order my men to load the bow chasers with chain, to rip her sails apart and slow her down. The chainshots rip right trough her sails, we fire a couple more, finaly she's slowing down enough for me to give her a devastating stern rake. I carefully manouver my ship into raking position, she has nowhere to go, I order the men to go full starboard I adjust the sails and the ship almost turns on the spot. I order the men to hold steady as i'm not sailing perpendicular to her stern. As the first cannon aligns with the stern, I order to open fire, big round balls shoot across the lenght of the french ship, I hear the french crew scream and my men cheer and applaud as the enemy crew is shocked. The whistle blows and my men know they need to prepare for boarding, muskets, axes and swords are brought up to the weatherdeck, and I order my ship to push the enemy ship into the wind so she's slow enough to board. The men are moving and shouting around on the weatherdeck, blood is about to be spilled. My hull squeecks and crackles when I smash it into the side of the French ship. She's slowly turning against the wind and finaly she's sailing slow enough for us to swing the boarding hooks, and my men storm the enemy deck while the piper plays them a tune for courage.The enemy takes a stand and tries to use fire granades, but one attack was enough to make the enemy surrender. I capped myself a ship, my men cheer, we  sail back to kingston with a hold full of loot. Today was a good day.*Role playing off*This game is truly of epic proportions, and I have my gametime to prove it. I guarantee you'll be in this game for no less then a 100 hours, it has so many things to offer and try.There's always danger and opportunity around the corner in this game, get in and be prepared to sink a couple of times before you can finaly send your first oponent to the bottom of the oceans. See you at the rolling main! "

								Disclaimer: I am fully aware the state of this game is Alpha Testing, and this review is for that and the current state of the game as of 4/16/2016.Note: This is geared towards new players or players who are thinking about purchasing this game.Started playing before the patch that broke everything and before that point it seemed like a solid game and was playable as a new player. Then that dreaded patch it and it is basically impossible now to do much of anything as a new player.There is a somewhat decent learning curve to this game and I am perfectly fine with that, learning to actually aim your cannons vs the distance your target is at, is great and I loved playing, but when the AI can hit you not only harder but with unrealistic accuracy for a new player to fight against. Well lets just say I will not be launching this game for a while.I am fully aware that I am new and that I suck, and if it were just that alone I would be posting this I would just set down the game and walk away, but when I have a clan mate, who has been playing since steam launch and is very decent at this game, and he is unable to defeat a Midshipman's mission with the starting gear we get, tested with each cannon type, then how are we, the players who have under 10 hours play and no really knowledge of the game? This game has a ton of potential and I would love to see this issues fixed and then and only then would I be willing to change this review and say yes this game is worth it, until no thanks.			"

								Probably the worst and unforgiven MMO ever coded.There is no group encouragement at all, there is no group loot, there is no rewards for playing with friends what so ever.Bought this game in hope that it would be a massive pwf game, but when you can have 1 member getting all the loot, gold etc for a combat mission? That sucks so incredible hard. Okej it's in an ""Alpha"", but for gods sake, do an tutorial for newcomers.Set up a grouploot and encourage players to play together. Dont be like Donald Trump, a massive knob. Naval Action is all about the singular action, not for those with friends.			"

								Love the age of sail, so this game has huge draw for me. Actually I found it through a fan group for The Aubrey /Maturin book series. Have not been disappointed! At first it took some getting used to, but once you understand the controls both in combat and out, it's relatively intuitive and a blast to play. Resources trading and crafting add depth, open world is HUGE (sailing from Jamaica to Belize takes ~45 minutes, depending on ships and winds) and new players can jump right in with no prior knowledge of sailing etc. Visually I find it beautiful as well, in addition to helping me finally visualize ship manuevers.Perhaps a bit pricey but hey, et least they're not chanrging us for DLC! Play to unlock - the gamer dream, right? Unlike some of the bigger names out there charging sometimes almost as much as the brand new game for just a few new maps. Very unique and well executed - and any bugs are being worked on, you have only to let the devs know!10/10.Give it a try, shipmate.			"

								Naval Action? More like Naval No Action...It is one of the most boring games I ever played as I find myself logging in only to log out 5-10 minutes later because I don't feel like grinding my life away and there is no action. Since the fantastic Seatrials I don't think I've even played for more than an hour at once and I bought the game some time before Jan 2015.This game could have been something great, but it has utimately fallen short and player counts are dropping at a significant rate. There used to be something called Sea Trials, which was more of a battle styled arena game, but the devs decided to take that away and make the game an MMORPG instead, which in mine and many other peoples minds, was a huge mistake as you can't just jump into the action anymore. I also have to add that the devs are not very professional or transparent with development. Instead of using personal handles they simply go by one ""Admin"" account on their forums. The community is almost cult like and any criticism is met with fierce rebuke. Development has been very slow and has not made substantive progress since Pre-alpha. The only redeeming part of this game is the ship models and combat. The rest of the game is bunk and unless you have hours and hours to spend grinding away, you will not get anywhere in the game. It's as though the devs want players to focus on fighting AI rather than other players.Overall If I was you I would not waste £30 on this game. Many people including myself thought that we had found the ultimate Age of Sail naval game when we got this game, only to be left with a sour taste in our mouth by the devs who only seem to accomodate for a particular group of forum players who literally praise every decision they make.

								Game is great, typical problems for an alpha release. Developers will definitrly need to get better communication if they plan a successful launch. No pre release info, most releases come with patch notes. They say they will not make any major decisions without information, but rarely fulfill this. Server instability is typical for aplha, and as there is no information when sevrers do go down, can be frustrating if it is only your server. 2/10 would not recommend to others. "

								I have loved this game, I stopped playing it because I don't like the direction is taking.   There are a few problems that make it out of balance:There are countries/factions that have more population than others.   The problem with the unfairs gankings has not been adressed correctly yet. you can find yourself fighting in a little trader without cannons with 9 braves ships full of cannons.The path that the game is taking make not sense to me, to make a vesel now is a two weeks grinding fine woods,,,, a vessel that you can lose in 20 minutes or less. but they want more PVP.Mistakes that are not been solved like :Trade has becoming too complex.... previusly was very simple and now we are at the other side of the pendulum.Special blue prints for ships that were given randomly in special events. Events weren't working like intended and were taken out... but now a few players have those Special Blue prints and there is not way to have them yourself.I love the game anyway. good graphics, good battles when balanced and I still have hope, it still in alpha.

The devs have been great at implementing good content and mechanics as requested by players. Most of the frustration in game stems from certain players taking advantage of things like alts and unsportsman like gameplay, that the devs have been in the process of working out how to prevent those things.

But I'd still recommend the game taking in consideration that the naval combat and the sea physics are pretty good. Far from a perfect game but still alot of fun.			"

								This game is great. Most of the negitive reviews are based on the fact the game isnt finished but this game is exactly what you think it is and if your into sailing or sailing ship combat this game is great. Starts off slow but it picks up and gives you a lot to do. The game has a lot of potential on top of already being a very good game in its Alpha state. As someone who has done a good bit of sailing id say this game does a very good job at making everything playable yet complex to seem like your sailing. its almost like your sailing a ship from Empire Total War except better. Yes there are some very obvious incompleted bits like the background in the menus and the ability to see your ships in dock but considering its AN ALPHA you should damn well know what your getting into when you decide to sink 40 dollars into it. The combat is very realistic. Your movement over the waves combined with your timming as well as the direction of the wind, angle of attack, what kind of ammo, when to repair, how to repair, your officers and their specials, the kind of guns, and a bunch of other stuff keep you occupied very well. The crafting system and Trade systems are very fulfilling as far as how much you feel you accomplished at the end. And the game in 4K looks truely amazing.			"

								First off, I didn't buy the game until steam release (which I was really psyched about) but I've been following it and watching gameplay for a long time. I personally don't recommend it but here are some things to consider.There is no mode for you to try all the various ships. You start in a tiny cutter and work your way up.XP gain is atrociously slow. It takes 1000XP to get out of the starting level. I get around 20-50XP per match. Matches last 10-30 minutes so if you do the math that's going to be at least 3 hrs just to get to the second level.There doesn't appear to be an easy way to navigate in the game. There's a map but you can't deterimine your position. You can't even draw on the map to plot your course (no one back then would sail without plotting on a map so this is a huge oversight).The obvious pluses areBeautiful graphicsIntense realismFunctioning open worldAll in all I was sad and disappointed that I won't get to enjoy the game due to my time constraints.

								What this game has over the World of Warships, is that you can actually play more than 3 people at once. that is if you have more than 3 friends. And in my opinion its more fun to play this with more friends. Alone this game is a loss, but shines with more. recommend this? well yes if you have some love for old warships and want to do play with others. Its duable alone, but it never hurts to have some help. This is def a mp game but i do not dare to go as far to call this a mmo. That is why i think its to early to say. Price wise, its on the  steep end.			"

								This is EARLY EARLY EARLY ACCESS, like nothing is here content wise, but they are still asking you to pay $40 - I got a refund. Here's your options when playing:1. Accept auto generated tasks such as ""go kill a ship we marked on your map"" - it's a pointless mission with no story or any reason to give a ♥♥♥♥. It's just a random ship that you have to kill. No hunting it, no exploring to find it, you litterally have it marked on your map and you go into the instance.2. PvP - either have a group to play with or get ganked, the same old ♥♥♥♥ as the missions, kill the other ships with cannons. The boarding is pathetic, you click buttons in a rock paper scissors format...So pvp is just shooting ♥♥♥♥ing cannons all night.3. Trade / Craft - Buy and sell items on the horrible UI. Not only is it a pain to use and navigate, it's ugly as hell. You'll be buying items and then sailing to another port to interact with another pointless boring menu. No story, no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥.And that's it! Really! Shoot cannons, watch your boat sail on the travel-map, and interact with a horrible menu system. No story, no give a ♥♥♥♥, no boarding mechanic, you are literally a ♥♥♥♥ing ship. Not to mention, your crew cycles the EXACT SAME ANIMATION for the entire duration of your battle, they load cannons when they aren't being loaded, they stand there like mannikins, cannon balls pass right through them. This game is downright ugly in the details, but looks great from far away.The pricing structure of these Early Access titles should follow the development of the game - as the game gets more complete, the price goes up. Or there should be a large extension on the time-limit of the Refund Terms on Early Access games. Instead they are offering a complete♥♥♥♥♥♥shallow experience and asking for an AAA title price of $40 and saying ""trust us, we'll make a good game"".			"

								It was hard not to fall asleep at the wheel to be honest ,i thought i would try the PVE server until i got the hang of ""sailing"" turns out it wasn't that hard to get the hang of it .I played for three hours - most of whitch was spent in open waters with nothing else to do but swing the camera around to simulate a little seasickness just to add content to the game .I thought id ask a few questions in the chat and got no responces ,so i tried the help tab ,to get no responces lol So i finally get somewhere and find a ship i can attack ,that then just sails off into the sunset before i have even turned my ship around ,the battle zone mechanics are differant than in open waters and takes 2 minuites just to get moving at an almost backwards rate ,at which point the battle is over and anything that doesnt run off is because its about to obliterate you .I can apreceiate this just makes me sound like a crap player but when it can be anything from 10 mins-45 mins between battles ,you find yourself aimlessly sailing up and down coats, just trying to find something to get a little Xp from and progress just a little .If you are expecting AC Blag Flag without the Assasins Creed bit ,you are going to be dissapointed ,and it certainly not worth the full asking price IMO as it stands at the moment .World Of Warships is better in my opinion.

								Watch out for people review brigading the game because it isn't going in a direction that they want it to go. Recently it has been nearly all of the negative reviews, some of it stems from a population issue that exacerbated the need for separate time zones for the servers (RvR gameplay is nearly 24/7 right now even if you choose the ""EU"" server).The game is taking some good steps in the right direction if you ask me, with a lot more focus on the player experience than the typical never happy RvR elitist core. In the end, even if some of those people are lost it isn't a big deal and could actually be helping the game further.As for the RvR being 24/7: This has been a broken mechanic in the game since day one, but a very vocal minority on the forum took it upon themselves to berate anyone mentioning it. If you think the moderators on the website are bad you should see the angry vitriol being spewed from some of these players.			"

								First, I LOVE THIS GAME. Sailing around on wooden ships, and blasting the hell out of other wooden ships--it doesn't get better than that, unless you add alcohol. Hence, this drunkenly-written review. Why is the rum always gone?I sailed from the Bahamas, around the Keys, to the west coast of Florida to try and sail up the Caloosahatchee, to get to Lake Okeechobee. I then found out it was too shallow to sail (and/or couldn't find the river). XP for sailing? Hell yes. Much fish along the way, to sell? Hell yes, profit!Yeah, there's bugs to work out, but that's why it's in Alpha state, and has a bug-report key. Hint: it's F11.Score? 8/10, because you never leave out room for improvement.			"

								Good game, one of a kind. Don't let the negative reviews discourage you. Check out some videos on youtube (my favorites are Liquicitizen Sili's shorter engagements), and see for yourself. Of course those are only the action, they don't show the more time consuming open world sailing between cities.Definitely recommended for sailing euthasiasts, as the sailing mechanics are decently accurate in the game.If you are into playing in groups and have a lot of time, it might be worth it. The playerbase is very helpful and mature, the developers are IMO pretty nice and answer most questions as long as you are not toxic and not constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ing about problems.The game's open world aspect is interesting albeit somewhat timeconsuming, as the map is REALLY huge, so the travel times are pretty long, even the closest cities are 5-10 minute distance from each other. This solution is timeconsuming, but there is something spectacular about losing the sight of land, as you are not marked on the map at all, you only know which city you came from and what heading you have been keeping. Your coordinates are shown on the map screen because a lot of people got lost and complained about it :DThe game features a well fleshed out battle instance system which takes the landmasses from your open world position into the instance, so if there was land in front of you, it will be there in the battle too, you need to take that into consideration when you position yourself before engaging. The battle system overall is great, other than the boarding mechanism which is being worked on to make it more complex.The game has a reasonable economy system which is constantly being tweaked by the devs to make it fit the server population, mostly with success.There is also a ship crafting system (most good quality ships are crafted and sold by other players in the game). The devs said though they are reworking the quality system to make it simpler, but that will probably only happen with the launch.The game will leave early access during 2017, and there will be a wipe before launch, so you might be better off waiting until that to buy the game. The current state is pretty solid, but there are wipes hanging in the air - port wipes (where every port is returned to the original owner realm), and a full assett wipe before launch. I heard they will not wipe the XP though. The 40€ price is pretty much solidified, don't expect it to be on sale, at least not before launch.			"

Early Access Review
								Mind you, this is an early access review!In my opinion this game currently is suited only for folks that are(a) actually used to early access and have no problems with temp features and bugs and unfinished stuff(b) people that have time and patience to work towards long-term goals(c) folks actually very much interested in sailing and / or the era of classical sailingIf you can say ""aye, that's me"" to those three points then this game will be an absolute stunner for you!Absolute pro:The sailing and combat mechanics are insanely realistic by gaming standards. This means that you will spend loads of time waiting for the right angle, the right direction of wind, the cannon to reload or just to come into range - followed by intense battle moments. If you know how your ship behaves you can win battles against much bigger opponents by outsailing and outmaneuvering them and this is something that I really like about it as someone who is an actual yachtsman.Managing and tuning your ship and crew is rewarding and complex: You can add modifications to your ship that influence certain performance, from turning rating to rigging speed, from cannon type to water pump quality. With some work you can turn your ships into speeders, capturing ships, artillery specialists or armed cargo haulers.The economy system still is changing alot but gives you a whole new angle to the game: crafting resources and ships you can make yourself a mastercrafter and influence the market of your faction by providing much needed materiels. You can use the money to expand your production facilities in the ports or buy materiels that you need to build even bigger ships. You will have to find a way to bring your resources from one port outpost to another, though and this is not always a good idea to do if there are 10 enemy ships privateering in your area.Sounds and especially graphics are simply awesome. The ship detailing and the weather simulations are simply beautiful for a game that is not taxing on the computer. They are also somewhat adding to game depth and realism as a night battle will actually require you to look for that cannon flashes if your enemy is far away and the smoke from a broadside can give you a sight screen if timed right. The UI still is horrible - mind you. It will be redesigned but apparently this is a minor priority right now for the devs - I can live with that but I can also understand if people say it's a no-go for them.neutral:The learning curve and the resulting frustration can be insanely high. There is no tutorial whatsoever and you will make some bad mistakes you will regret later if you don't read up first. In my first 5 hours I sailed a redeemed and costly ship without cannon and got myself into a fight and lost a durability point. Then I sold the ship for virtually nothing - something I regretted for a long time afterwards. Read yourself up in the wiki and steam guides, ask other players, join a clan and ask there, watch videos - it will help you alot enjoing the game!Supporting roles are only rewarded by other players - not by the game. This I cannot stress enough because I love to support and this game does not make it easy for you - as some players don't care about it as I do I still put it under neutral. There are loads of possibilities to help out your task force or your clan either in battle or in open world or in economy. You can cut off enemy sailing paths, ram your small ship into larger ships in order to give your allies enough time to approach, play cannon fodder, be on lookout for enemies, take part in blockades of ports - but this will not be rewarded by the game, you will suffer. Go and find yourself a clan that rewards and supports you and does the same for you - it makes it much more easy.Absolute negative:The UI simply is horrible right now. loca-strings, insufficient tool tips, inconsistent ""are you sure you wanna do that"" buttons and an non-existing design combined with a bad organisation of buttons - this will be reworked but right now it is a mess and some of the biggest frustrations stem from that.Lack of QOL features is also a big no-no for me: I can understand that some of this lack stems from balancing reasoning but they are essentially a big downer for investing in large campaigns. The fact that you cannot send back captures goods automatically or that you will absolutely have to sail the whole way around from one port to another in order to bring goods from a to b sucks much fun out of the economy for example.

								Simply spectacular. If you want a button masher or arcade experience, go somewhere else. This game is a splendid recreation of the age of sail, and only patient captains need apply.The ships. Oh my god, the ships. Beyond beautiful. The map is enormous in scale, so there can be some long voyages. Grab a Hornblower or Aubrey book, set sail, and enjoy. You won't regret it.			"

								I was addicted to this game but now I'm going to delete it completely from my hard drive Why!Because the Dev/Admin who claims they made this game has a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and I mean a real poor, unprofessional and rude attitude they also admit they dont give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about money. Just read the Admins comments on the 9.67 update on their game-lab forum they are disgusting considering people paid £30 pounds for this EARLY ACCESS selfish hardcore MMO.It's a shame cause I was starting to like it and it does has some good but reading the comments by the Admin he seems to treat every customer like employees. Just look at some of the comments in pirate thread by admin in the game labs forum and you will see what I mean. Some of the comments by admin makes think they can't have the intelligence to create any game, it's like it was just given to them from another dev.I'm qiute gobsmaked and I don't know what else to say, Just look at the comments on the game labs forum.I mean if they are not bothered about the money nor the fact it is bleeding players then why the hell did they make it an MMO and include the US? It doesn't make sense.I wish I did look on there forums first because I most Certainly wouldn't want to give that Dev any of my money. He is disgusting. I'm also going to complain to steam too for poor customer service although it wasn't me involved in the forum. It's a real shame cause I wanted to play this over Easter But I just cannot support rude and arrogant Devs!			"

								I have been playing now for a month or so for an hour or two per day and still find new things to do and content of interest. Superb game, for the long term thinker. Who are enthralled with the time period and age of sail. Those avid readers of Alexander Kent and Patrick O'brien and the like will not be disappointed. Only real let down was that there was no tutorials within the game. However the player community are so helpfull that gameplay is easily and quickly picked up and there are of course many you tube videos and lots of texts which have been produced by players. It would  be nice for some version of offline play mode for those of us that have to travel and may not always have internet access, but I guess this would only be wanted by the few and not the many. I believe the developers listen well to the community and are keen to further develop the game to meet the players wish lists for the future. Well worth the money in my opinion.			"

								This game has vast potential to be the definitive game of this (very niche) genre.  If you, like me, spent hours reading Hornblower as a teenager, dreaming of what it'd be like to sail a frigate, or ship of the line, this is game for you.  The combat is mostly accurate (with some small concessions to playability) and the ship models are beautiful.  Couple of things to note; firstly, this game is in alpha.  It is not feature complete, and there are some bits that need work.  The devs are responsive and reasonably good at communication, open to suggestions and constructive critisism.  The UI in particular at the moment needs a lot of work on it - this is coming once they have completed all the planned features. It is a bit of a resourse hog at the moment; I hope that there will be some optimisation at a later date.secondly, there is a steep learning curve - I'd advise that you join a clan (lots of different clans for different reasons exist) to get advise and help.  On the whole, if you like sailing and simulation games, if you're into C18-19 sailing warfare, if you're up for a game with rough edges, this game is for you.			"

Pay no heed to negative community members. Great game and always getting better.			"

								Well this game is very slowpaced. Sailing 15 minutes to do a 2 hour mission is not uncommon. So if you are hoping for quick action this game isnt for you. This game has nice graphics and more and more placeholders are getting their historical replacements in.However what makes this game bad is the ingame situation where chat admins / moderators ban people for no reason really besides that the community is a bunch of little children. Everyone takes offence of the littlest things. If you want to play a game where you have to be political correct and can't say the F word without getting a 7 day ban. Get this game. Concerning PVP, pvp is ♥♥♥♥ed, most of the times you are chasing someone for 45-90 minutes to even start a fight. If you don't have much time it is not worth the effort.All in all this was a huge waste of time. Don't get this game. It is made by some back alley gamestudio in Ukraine who don't care about anything except making money.			"

								Im going to be blunt about this, this game not for everyone, this game is a simulation, It not not easy, It is not fast paced, you will spend along time sailing from place to place.ships take time to sink. However, if you want a game that makes you feel like you are a ships captian in 1815, this os the game for you. Alot of the negitive reviews are from early access players where they where juat testing the combat system and rhere was no open world or due ro aome drama going on between part of the community and the devs, alegidly the devs deleted some negitive reviews and got into some arguments on the forms, I dont know for sure about the first one (I believe it though) but I have seen proof of the heated arguments, I dont agree with the devs doing this, however I will give them the benefit of the doubt and say they may have been having a bad day becaulse up untell now they have been nothing but nice. l warn you there is a steep learning curve but for me it has been worth it. This has been one of the dunest games I have ever played			"

								Normally I do not review a pre-release game after so little playing time, but on this one I feel that I have to warn people before spending a massive 30-odd pounds or equivalent on this game.After reading the reviews and looking at the screenshots I was exaulted! This would be my new favourite game.Maybe my expectations where a bit too high? But in the pre- and reviews things like accurate sailing physics where mentioned more than a few times.This is the greatest disappointment of all, sure you need to tack your ship by hauling the masts in the correct seaquence. however even if you have no clue what that means, just leave auto-skipper on and your ship will happily sail like in any other arcade shooter game.Being a sailor myself (no longer proffesional but still for hobby) I tried some tactics on the cutter only to find out that they don't work. One of those tactics would be to sail opposite to the enemy, turn into wind, push out the spanker, opposite rudder and drift backwards. Although all these mechanics exist in the game, the ship doesn't respond correctly to those stearing inputs. instead the direction relative to the wind only has infuence on the total speed of the ship, the stearing relies 100% on the rudder (apparently no effect of heal etc.) and as a result the ship becomes uncontrolable going backwards at 0.2 knots.Sure this is a pre-alpha release but as this is the very core of the game I can only hold faint hope that this is merely an unpolished aspect.If you like arcade pirate shooters, go for it. if you like Age of Pirates 2 multiplayer? go for it. If you like scentec sail simulator 5? stay away from this... at least for now.I will keep this review updated if the sailing physics improves, but for now, alas, thumbs down :(			"

								Well, this game is a mixed bag. On one hand, the graphics, gameplay, and over all feel are all refined and feel well polished. On the other hand, this game takes a lot of devotion, it punishes greatly for each mistake you make, and glitches run wild in this game right now. I like it, but some may not. For one, there is a durability system. You start off with each ship you have thats a 5th rate or lower has 5 durability points. These points are how many times you can surrender or get sunk until your ship is gone. For good. Overall, this game I think is a must-buy for someone who likes the age of sail.			"

								I've refunded my buy, I will be definitly back to it at some point in the future, but for now gui is crap, no tutorial what to do, it seems to be pay to win game, with premium ships available in real-cash shop. Graphics are good, but water's physics are crap. Open world is cool, but after 30 mins of sailing around it simply becomes boring and pointless. Also pvp is not all that great. It takes forever to sink another ship, so 1v1 battles become boring after 10 minutes. I will buy it again, but as for now, i don't recommend to buy it, if you are a fan of completed games(i know it's an early access, but for 37 euros i expected something more)			"

The open world and fighting is a veritable masterpiece of beautiful landscapes and ships. Watching you for slowly turn into splinters is continuously rewarding!			"
