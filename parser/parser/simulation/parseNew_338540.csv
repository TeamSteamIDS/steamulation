												Well, I will start with the good things first. This game is fun, its very easy to pick up and its interface is fairly user friendly. Its tutorial could be a bit more in depth, but all in all if your looking to enjoy a game for a few hours and it is free this is a good way to go. I say a few hours and I dont recommend this game because thats all it takes to get from tier 1 to 4 in the ships... then at tier 4 is where the problems begin and i mean serious problems. Like world of tanks this game uses a tier system for ships with relatively weak ships at low tier and strong ships at high tier, At tier 4 you will start to see tier 9 to 11 ships, this basically ends the game. These ships have double your hp, do double your damage and have double your view range. Prepare to be destroyed over and over again.As this game has a small community 95% of games will be like this, every so often you get a rare gem of same tier ships in a game and for me this simple but engaging game is great at times like that. But having to work your way thru game after game of no contest destruction by ships much higher level is tedious at best. This then brings me onto the second problem with this game, and for me the more important issue. The people in the tier 9 to 11 ships, the games veterans. There is two sides to this and I can see both, there appears to be very few people reach these high tiers so without being placed in games against low tiers they would never be able to play these top tier monsters. But this has the knock on affect of no one will reach high tier because of what i said above.The other side is the attitude of these veterans, they are toxic and rude people. If you dare to point out the inbalance of this matchmaking their attitude is disgusting, and so I am sad to say that for once a game is ruined by the people who play it. They are rude, offer no assistance and generally a nasty group of people. So let them have their high tiers thats fine, and hopefully people will read this and heed my warning to not play this game, so eventually they'll  be left with a ghost game and maybe then they'll see the consquences of there actions.In short a decent fun game thats easy to play. But awful matchmaking and TOXIC COMMUNITY VETERANS.UPDATE FOR IN RESPONSE TO NASTY EYESI unfortunately have not returned to the game in recent months so my review maybe out dated if they have addressed some of the issues. I have added this section to my opinions and will direct people to read your comment and hopefully the game will expand again. Thank you for the update.			"

												I have played both Navyfield 1 (started mid 2009) and Navyfield 2 since launch. I have 3 level 50+ captains in NF2 so ignore what steam says about me not playing for very long. I'll try to be as in-depth but at the same time I'll give you the straight truth on what's going on with this game...Box art description: Navy Field is a game about WW2 naval battles where you choose a nation, decide which ship line to go down, then play out sea warfare in glorius 2006-era graphics. Where the game lacks in graphics, it makes up for in strategic combat that can actually be quite thrilling if you're into this sort of game. THE GRIND:Now let me get this out of the way first: This will be the make or break the game for most of you out there. There is a term for what this game puts you through and that term is ""Grind"". This game will require days of your life in order for you to play ANY ship beyond Tier VII. There are 11 tiers. The good news is that the first 6 tiers are fairly easy to get to by playing normally without any sort of booster or Premium(More on this later). The better news is you can get to every single ship class by Tier IV so you can try all different playstyles before you uninstall this game because of the crazy grind to Tier X.THE P2W:All in all, this game is only truly about 20%15% Pay to Win. There are no ""Premium Ships"" in NF2 (unlike NF1), and there are no Premium Weapons or Premium Planes or anything. Every ship/item in the game must be earned with XP from battles.The P2W currency in this game is ""Gold"". With Gold you can buy  ""Premium"", which is like a subscription and does a few 'subscriber'-like things. The main reason anyone would buy premium would be for the Credit and XP boost that comes along with it, a whopping 50% boost. ... Not the most P2W I've ever seen by far but maybe that's why it's so cheap.I've paid for Premium before, and battles where I'd average 800 xp I'd be getting about 1200 xp so there's a decent boost from it.  But the main advantage of Premium is that it unlocks extra officer slots you wouldn't normally have. This is a huge advantage and if you want to take advantage of this you could pay for a single day of Premium and this permanently unlocks the slots. EDIT: After further review, it appears as though these slots are unlocked by default. Which means I would change the amount of P2W this game is down to about 15% from 20%. But either way, that's the most pay to win aspect of this game. There are a few other things, such as items for your ship you can buy that will give you a 15% boost to your engine recharge speed or for 1000 gold (roughly $10) you can straight up buy 100,000 credits from the store. But the truth is without the EXP you gain from battles, you can't even unlock anything worth buying. So the grind they've implemented actually cuts their P2W factor down by quite a lot. Whether this is a good thing or not is up to you. ATTENTION: If you've gotten to this point and are still on board, congratulations! You might not hate this game after all! I mean, I do. But I still play it. It's a love-hate relationship. Anyway, I'll actually outline some game details so you can know what to expect.First, each nation has it's own advantages and disadvantages. For example, Japanese torpedos do WAY more damage than UK torpedos. But UK's armor on their ships can take IJN cannons all day. The different ship lines are: DD (Destroyer), CL (Light Cruiser), CA (Heavy Cruiser), BB (Battleship), CV (Aircraft Carrier), and SS (Submarine). They're each good at different things, and to win you must play on your strengths as a team of different ships. When you first choose your capatin, you'll enter into the harbor to inspect your ship and enlist crewmen. There are 4 types of crewmen: Weapons Officers, Support Officers, Engineering Officers and Aviation Officers. Each one has 3 different stats you can put points into as they level up along with your captain, who has his/her own 5 stats you can level up. All of these stats change the way your crew works. For example, if you have Weapons Officers that are high in Reload but low in Accuracy, then you'll pump out the shells but they'll spray everywhere at longer distances.Finding a battle is easy enough: Click the ""Battle"" button. They have a ""Platoon"" system in place that will allow you and 2 friends to enter in the same battle. If you have a larger group however just have everyone hit ""Battle"" and you'll find each other :)During battle, the goal is to be the best (insert ship class) you can be by racking up damage points and capturing objectives. If you are sunk during a battle, you can wait until the end of the battle to receive a larger EXP and Credit bonus towards your ship and crew. I would recommend this game to anybody looking for something different and interesting to play. I mean,♥♥♥♥♥♥.. it's free. What's the worst that could happen? You actually like it? HINTS:Ask questions. People will answer.Give your torps at least 1 second to arm.VISION IS OPIf you're a DD and there's a sub around, use your damn sonar. 'Gradual' firing mode is good for learning how the shooting mechanics work.AP ammo removes the armor so HE does full damage. Think ahead: Put points into your commander as if you were playing the ship you want to play from Day 1. You'll be way better off. Ex: If you're building an aircraft carrier, give your commander aviation points instead of weapons. Thanks for reading, and I apologize for any misspellings. If you need a friend to roll with, send me a request and I'll support you as best I can. I have one of each ship class and would be happy to help you in any way I could if you need it :) Just send me a pm or comment and I'll do my best!			"

												Great concept of a game, terrible game company, terrible administration, terrible execution.No team play, no balance, no end game goals, terrible support, poor game dynamics. Navyfield was able to run for 10 years, despite their managers (Game Developers and Company Management) doing everything they could in order to make it fail. Up to this day they make the worse decisions ever and out of the blue they are nuking their most loyal players from the game without any sort of explanation.You just have to check what is going on with Navyfield to get a feeling of what you will go through with Navyfield 2. Players who have purchased subscription and items are being removed from the game without breaking any rules and are losing all what they have invested. This fabulous concept has turned into a scam to lure people into giving money only to be removed from the game days later without any possibility of getting their hard earned money back. It is a South Korean company run by North Korean mentality. I suggest you stay far far far away from all this. The game is not worth the drama and terrible customer support you will undoubtedly go through while playing with this game company.Seriously, don't even think about playing this game. NF2 is just a money scam.			"

												I was a fan of Navyfield, i've passed a lot of time on it when i was young.I hoped that Navyfield 2 could be that cool, but i was wrong.They basically made navyfield in 3d, and simplify it to the bone.Progression like world of tank, no more shop with different cannons with different stat, now you progress throught 2-3 cannons that are barely the same.No more armor add like it was, now you buy the slot in the ship and than you can buy armor buff token that last 7 days.Pay to win, try to stop a full buff shopper, all the team need to focus him, and he will oneshot everything.No more officer trading.Cant name the ship.They speed up every ship like twice of Navyfield1. Smaller ship are like speedboat that drift throught the ocean, also even the torpedo are twice the speed.The matchmaking is fu**ed, when i hit tier 4 i faced tier 7 ships in every match.Sorry nexon, but you made a flop, this game is comparable to a tablet game. All you had to do is to udpate the graphics, not to change it to a super simply pay to win game.Stick with navyfield 1 guys. "

												What could have been a good game, has turned into a piece of garbage.  It is deffinatly a PAY TO WIN game, that non wallet warriors have little chance of success. It seems like it is following every other cash grab games plan.The game play is interesting enough, but the science fiction that it incorporates is VERY dissapointing...I still cant get over how games can scew up HISTORY....This one is no different......a few examples.1. teleporting of ships....REALLY???2. Desrtoyers (wallet warrior) that can take 8 Long lance torpedo hits (most Destroyers could not survive 1 LOL)3. Landing Craft that can outrun a Light Cruiser with armor to rival a Cruiser (they look like PT boats they are so fast)Then we can get into the downtime of the game as of late...not good, with them changing their minds like their underwear on issues they are trying to ""fix""....ends up WORSE!I gave it 3 weeks of play before writing this review to be fair....Just fyi.I had really hoped for it to be better.

												Wasnt sure at first if this would be better than NF1 though I highly doubt it.Thing is, it just doesnt matter. The game has P2W elements. I dont know why the other reviews say no P2W. (they obviously didn't check the shop/they think no sane person would purchase them when thats not true for people with jobs)Few examples: %5 less reload time with ingame credits. %10 less reload time with real money. Theirs different types of this like repair rate ect. On top of that they all weigh less on your ship as well. (less decreased speed on gold purchased upgrades) PLUS: They stack up as well on your ship.Morale boosts with real money so you can make sure you are having close to 100% of your sailor stats or you can easily go negative or just not reach there without a grind of wins.Also you can get gold officers which start with +31 of a specific stat. Ingame credit officers start with all 1 stats and will most likely cap out without the 31 bonus that gold officers get only.Theres just no excuse for having this type of monetization. Should of kept it to skins and premium time. Do you really want to support P2W features and have it snowball back to style like in previous Korean games?			"

												I'll keep this short and simple, this is a game that comes on from a great legacy in Navy Field. Navy Field was a game which rewarded skill and practice, learning angles, timing torpedo runs, hiding from the enemy fleet as a submarine. It was a truly fun if a time consuming game. Each ship had a role and they all worked as a combined unitNavy field 2 is none of that, its too arcadey. Ships are far too agile with Battleships easily turning and slotting through torpedo runs when turning in them should be a large effort, they act more like Destroyers in Navy Field than Battleships. On top of this you have Carriers, all ways fun in Navy Field as they were strong but any ship which could slip in could kill them easy and submarines were there bane but in this they are pretty much freexp, torpedo planes can drop and arm torpedo's from 2 meters and this makes Dive Bombers pointless and fighters are not worth the time as they cannot kill Torpedo planes before they drop there Torp run.Overall if you want an Arcade warship game then turn to World of Warships or Battlestations: Pacific, if you want a fun Sim type navy game then try Navy Field but this tries to be both and succeeds at neither			"

												Okay, I thought this game was bad because of steam reviews. But the game isnt bad at all. Sure the graphics are a bit outdated, but graphics dont make the game. And it really is a free to play. I didnt have to go to my wallet for any boosts or buying ships. The game has factions of WW2: USA, Japan, England, and Germany. It has all kinds of ships. battleships, destroyers, aircraft carriers, light and heavy cruisers. Even heroic ships, the USS Nevada, Duke of Wellington i think it was,  and the legendary Bismark. Now this game is very easy to learn and get into really quickly. You can work your way to your first battleship in less than a hour.Now the gameplay itself focuses on two sides:alpha and bravo. Each side has a flagship, so losing the flagship is like losing the queen piece in chess. And once you die, you die. So there is a ton of strategy depending on your role.On the bad side, ugh took too long to make an account, and if you're new, you will die a lot, but least you get good points and xp. And when it rains, totally screws up your LoS sometimes. And the submarines will take sometime to master.Overall, it's not bad as the people say it was, you should check it out. Good luck and have fun.			"

												If you want good Naval game don't bother with this one. A little history behind this game and mine statement:I have played this game few years ago when it had been released by Nexon and it was bad. Game was closed after few months because it did not have player base and why? Because it was unbelievable Pay To Win - just few examples: premium captain, premium crew members, premium ships, premium account, premium armour, premium upgrades and what had been the best? Everything had been time limited for 1 week or 1 month EVEN PREMIUM SHIPS! So as I mentioned it have been closed. But then the original developer of NavyField 1 and Navyfield 2 decided ""Hey, it is not so bad, maybe we could get more money of it!"" so there were few days long alpha, few days long closed beta, few days long open beta (if I sum up CBT and OBT together it lasted for 12 days) and then they released this piece of crap. And even though that there are weekly updates they have not changed much past 4 months. (I have played from CBT)Few changed like no premium ships, not limited premium crew members and few more are good changes and I have to say it is much better game than it was but it is pretty much the only thing that this game does well and even though it is still Pay 2 Win. -There are still premium crew members, there are still some premium upgrades (few more XP, few more Credits ...) which does not look very good but in fact they are difference making. - Balance - This game does not have balance! You have tier 1 ship? No problem here play against tier 7. And that is pretty much how it does (not) work.- No Variety - Everything in game is pretty much the same. You wont be able to tell which ship is which, you wont be able to tell which nation is which. This brings me to another -- Year 2015 - This game is not for this year. It runs on Direct X9 and demands 8GB RAM, wut?! It is not even full 3D, water quality sucks, ships details sucks, animations sucks - the onnly pretty thing is the dock but if we compare it with NavyField 1's dock it sucks. - Grind - Everything starts great you can get rank 5 in 3-5 hours. But then it comes. 150K XP for one gun upgrade, 150K XP for another gun upgrade, 300K XP for next ship, and then again 200K XP for one gun upgrade (which are btw. almost useless), 300K for another gun upgrade and then WOHO only 4milions XP for next ship. Isnt it amazing? And the best part is that for most of the thing you need twice as much credits as XP so 1st you grind XP and then you grind for money. I do not recommend this game. If you want decent and good naval game wait for Wargaming's World of Warships. Do not waster your time AND money for this game (yea I know it is Free to Play well guess what? It is not after you get into it).			"

												I really wanted to like this game. I had my own fleet in NF1 and I was really hoping that this would be as good. Sadly it isn't.It feels clunkier, and manouevrering seems unrealistic.Increasing the ships' speed is unnaturally fast, I mean if a ship accelerated at this speed, you'd have to scrape the crew from the inside of the stern.The interface on NF1 was built using sprites but even though this is an outdated way of developing games it somehow worked. The upgrade to the new graphics has done nothing to make the game feel better than previous versions. Like another reviewer says, I don't want to compare this to WoWS but the developers or NF2 could get a better idea of how to improve this game by looking at one or two things from those games.I'll try this again in a few months and see if things have improved.

												Ive played this game alot, the only thing worse than the matchmaking is the lack of teamwork that leads to spending 15 minutes in a battle to literally get nothing but a repair bill.Its an interesting game that i did actually enjoy a bit until the player base expanded more. The community is becoming very toxic with little to no moderation and as others have said, it is extremely easy to win with your wallet.the tutorials and menus are terrible but once you get the figured out its not so bad, alot of the text and tooltips are severly lacking and sometimes are just an outright lie (some ship add ons say you cant have miltiple and others say nothing about it until you try to use it and then can only sell it back for half price).I was using this as a relaxing time waster but now its just a lesson in futility.

												Fun game, arcade style combat isn't what I like but, overall I approve. Tons of ships to play, nice game design with base capturing, seems very balanced. The balance part is good and bad I think, My first game I sunk a BB with the starter dinghy, which seemed like it should be impossible, but was fun.Plenty of P2W items, but limited item slots so P2W gets a small bonus that others cannot get, this is the games biggest negative. All the p2w items have double the bonus of the ingame currency version. Elite $ crew get 30% bonus compared to currency version.The 2nd biggest negative, no tooltips or some other mechanic explaining what everything does, and the menu is poorly designed; it can be hard to figure out what exactly items do , how to equip them etc. Without testing you don't know if there are caps in place for crew skills etc (does it help to have 3 max lvl repairers, or does it cap at 1 repairer? who knows...)

												First, I am not going to compare this game to what will (or might be) WoWS, or the WT version of naval battles, as those are different games with a different aproach. I will try to give an objective review of the game and not its competition.Second, I won't review balance, or what I think are temporary issues. The developer is fairly reactive and each weekly patch brings a lot to the game in my opinion. There are still issues, but I judge a game by its fun and its potential.Pros:- Gameplay is fun. Very fun. It is fast paced, team-based, strategic, and skill and positioning are a huge part of the game. You'll never get bored during a game. Guaranteed. Too much to do and think about.- Gameplay is varied. Playing a BB (Battleship), a DD (Destroyer), a CV (Aircraft Carrier) or a SS (Submarine) is very different, so that you can add variety to your gameplay from one game to the other or just find your playstyle. Each ship has its role (even 2 CLs can have very different roles depending on their loadout). You constantly switch between weapons (guns, torps, planes, mines, depth charges, AA, ...) and try to make the most out of it while navigating your ship. Significantly different maps. Game is surprisingly deep.- Beginning progression is very fast so you can get any class of ship within hours, and then you have to invest your time to get the top tiers. They just boosted permanently XP and credit gain by 2 and 1.5 respectively, for everyone.- Game makes it in a way that a tier I can take out a tier VII if played correctly/smartly. Very rewarding.- NOT Pay 2 Win. Premium account gives you the usual XP and Credit boost for faster progression. Some real money items give increased (temporary) stats in game but to the order of 10% max; which is definitely overcome by skill and teamplay. It is more P2W than games with a pure cosmetic cash shop, but I strongly believe the advantages are not significant.- Developer is its own publisher/editor, on this instance of the game, which means faster development cycle and patches.- Easy game to get into (simple basic controls, basic goals, immediate action, ...) ...Cons:- ... but difficult to actually understand. Poor documentation and tutorials forces you to discover things by yourself, or ask the community, to understand better how to play. Community is decent and people will answer your questions. This problem sometimes leads to frustration, but it is rewarding to get to know the game better. Lots of ""Eureka"" moments.- Linked to the above, but the game has its quirks, ie some unintuitive stuff from controls to interface. You get used to it after a few hours.- ""Korean grind"" game. You will 100's of similar games (but never the same).- Graphics and effects are outdated- historically inaccurate			"

												I've played this game a few months and have about 900 games under my belt.  If you're looking for a free-to-play naval game with arcade like gameplay then you should give this game a shot.  I only recommend it as such though, do not expect 100% realistic gameplay or you will be dissapointed.Pros:1)  Ship types are not only useful but neccessary for a team to win.  A team with 10 Battle Ships will lose to a mixed force that plays the map properly.2)  Similar to World of Tanks there are smaller vessels that exist in high tiers.  Think of it as light tanks or medium tanks at high tiers except with ships.  They all have their role on the battlefield.4)  Personal skill means a lot.  You cannot simply stomp someone just because you have a higher tier ship.  If you rush in without care then you will see lower tier ships mop the floor with you.5)  Rock-Paper-Scissors balance.  As stated above you need a mixed force however you can get hard countered by certain ships.  Submarines are able to take out Battle Ships and Aircraft Carriers with ease if the Destroyers and Light Cruisers do not hunt them down.Cons:1)  As in World of Tanks or War Thunder there will be games you just cannot win due to having a team that does silly things.  Personal performance can only carry you so far and some games are just unwinnable.  2)  Aircraft have no fuel gauge so if you plan to roll up the CV line you better have good micromanagement skills.3)  Some people say the game is insanely grindy.  In the past that has been true however the XP gains have been adjusted to reasonable levels.  This makes it possible for anyone to get into ships earlier than they probably need to be.  It only took 400 games to reach Tier 9 in the CV line but then again most people would say that's too much for an arcade like game.  XP has been doubled since then so hopefully that issue isn't around anymore for newer players.4)  No physics for ships.  You can stack all the ships together and have them occupy the same space.  If anyone shoots they'll hit the others which leads to people never ""crossing"" eachother to avoid accidentally blowing up the ally who cut across them.  A very cheesy tactic is to move your ship into the same space as the enemy ship so that their team cannot help them without blowing up their ally.  Meanwhile you can just pound away at their ship from within their footprint in the water.  Some ships have no way to lower their guns and cannot hit targets that close... all they can do is hope the smaller ship inside them runs out of ammo as they die a slow painful death.Is this game good?  I think so.  I'd pay $20.00 for this game if they asked since it's on par with the quality you would expect from a $20.00 game.  The matches do not last very long, 15 minutes tops, which means you can knock out a round or two before work or whenver you got a bit of free time and I like that.  Many tactics have evolved as people unlock different ships and soon organized Fleet Battles will come out and give the game a competative aspect.  Give it a shot if you love skill based Free-to-Play games that have no Pay-to-Win.			"

												Like going to the finest restaurant in town and finding your water is served in styrofoam cups, the flaws in this game do make you roll your eyes, but always over something that doesn't really matter. The core naval combat game seriously rocks. Zaggat rated 5 stars.Battles are 15 minutes long, if you survive that long or decide to stick around and watch the end after you are sunk. Ship on ship combat is nearly perfect, though the boats move a bit too fast for my taste, but you do get used to that. Graphics are nice except for anything written. They use some font that doesn't work well on my PC. Legible when tweaked, but not great.The pay-to-win elements are truly kept in check, unlike most games. To me, this speaks volumes about the devs. They actually understand that a well-balanced game will bring in more money. Every P2W element gives a slight advantage, but this game is so heavily skill-based that those slight advantages can be easily overcome by superior skill.There are 2 main gaming areas: the Battlefield and the Shipyard. The Shipyard is where you get new ships, put equipment on your ship, train your officers, etc. The major flaws in this game have nothing to do with battle. Battle is great. I mean it. Great. The flaws are with peripheral things like: It is hard to register to get the game started, there is no steam overlay (at least for some users currently), when I started the game, I couldn't read anything. Their FAQ page said to make your GUI bigger in Game Options if you can't read the font. The real solution was to turn down my screen resolution one level. Everywhere you look in the Shipyard will be phrases that were obviously translated into English by a computer translator, and then never proofread by a person who actually speaks English. Much of the instructions are tragically non-sensical. Fortunately the wiki is getting bigger everyday, and the forums and guides are good. And players in chat are helpful (which is another nice change of pace). So the Shipyard can be a bit difficult to figure out, but nothing there is real-time. You can always stop and ask for help when confused in the Shipyard. But that's it for flaws. Minor flaws that make you roll your eyes, but nothing that affects the core gaming experience, which is happily rock solid. Lots of newbies think this game is too hard, but it's usually because they don't understand that their small fast low-level ships can get to the enemies' big ships quicker than their own big ships can get there. Then they try to fight the big enemies without the back-up of their own big ships who won't arrive for another minute. This is a thinking-person's game. This game relies on understanding your role in a complex team, which few people seem to get. Then they complain that matches are made that put them up against top tier ships. Well guess what? You have the option to run away! Just at the start of battle, look to see the names of the players in high tier ships and avoid them, noob! It is a fun challenge if you don't play it like a boxing match where if you see an enemy you attack without thinking! There are things for low level players to do besides fight, like capture npc bases to give your team an airfield or something. Sheesh!8.6/10 Would sink while desperately trying to dodge depth charges in my sub again.			"

												Navy Field 2 is a good game in the sense that you're never bored.  Sure, the grind to the highest tier of ships can be boring at times, but not every game is the same.Let me break the game down really quick and justify why I can recommend this game.  Each game takes 15 minutes to play and every class has a use.  Destroyers can take down Battleships with good torpedo placement and kill subs, Light Cruisers can hunt down Destroyers and aircraft, Heavy Cruisers are very much pocket Battleships and Battleships, well, deals tons of damage from afar but have limited maneuverability and sigh.  Carriers are just as important because you're constantly fighting off enemy aircraft, providing your fleet with line of sight, and bombing other ships.  Sometimes the matchmaking will get a little wonky and put you in games with higher level ships, but I've had games where my lower tier Destroyer will be able to drop a high-tier Battleship so I'm not complaining.  Not too much anyway.The game is not as Pay to Win as most people make it out to be.  It's more of a grindfest more than anything, and the Premium account will make it easier to grind.  It's as simple as that, since there's nothing that's actually limiting gameplay.  Sure, you can spend gold and buy a few Officers and whatnot to edge out on higher-level opponents, but for the most part they are not necessary for the game.So let me go back to the 15 minutes per game part.  Even if you lose because you got blown out of the water, you can quit the game with some reward and begin your next game immediately.  The combat game itself is fantastic for this regard because there's always something to do.  Every second I'm managing my ship's speeds, dodging torpedoes, shooting off torpedoes of my own, training my guns for an effective angle and lead, and being aware of the map at the same time.  Having played RTS and MOBAs competitively, I would say this definitely ranks up there in terms of active things you can do to improve your game.  This is where the skill of the player comes in, and comes in in a big way.  A player that can take full advantage of his ship will be able to come up in a big way vs. a player who doesn't, regardless of tier.Overall, I definitely recommend players give this game a try.  It's fast-paced and can be unforgiving at times, but that's what I look for in a game that's designed around leveling up and tiers.  You need the combat to be highly engaging so the grind doesn't seem endless and that's what Navy Field 2 does very well.  The one thing that the developers needed in the game was proper documentation.  I feel that the game right now is a lot of bro-science.			"

												Where to start...The game is free-to-play, which also means there's a pay2win aspect somewhere in the game. However, unlike most others, you don't pay to get ships, you need to earn them. The only thing you're paying for (or at least want to pay for), would be the premium 50% boost that helps in the grind through ship tiers later, the officers for an extra boost, and/or extra ship slots to keep more ships (honestly, you don't need more than 5 if you plan on sticking with one or two classes). Otherwise, everything is obtainable through just playing normally.Now, the matchmaking. Yes, it needs some tweaking. You're not always going to be placed against people of your tier level, but I believe there's a good reason behind this, being that you get to experience fighting against different types of ship classes. And remember that the matchmaking puts you against a fleet (not clan fleet, just a fleet) equal to yours, meaning if they have Tier 9, you have buddies who are Tier 9 as well (or Tier 9 equivalent). The downside? You get wrecked if you're not careful.Best advice for new players is to capture islands, sub detect and provide AA, while trying to support your team from behind and survive. Everyone starts out as a Destroyer so you don't get to do much unless you're really good with your torpedoes and shelling first hand (I've sunk Battleships, just saiyan), it's pretty easy. Heck, you might even manage to land a kill steal and get that huge amount of XP. Eventually you'll reach Tier 3 in a few battles if you try to power through all the upgrades and not invest in any of your ship equipment. My friend did it in less than 30 minutes. You CAN face against stronger enemies even at low levels, but that relies on teamwork, not charging into everything.The community. I haven't really talked to many, so I can't really say, but I've had battles won with teamwork where we were outnumbered, some cooperative, some not. It happens.The grind. I'm a fairly new player myself although I've played since February (before dropping it for a while cause gemes), so I have yet to reach that part of the game. I'm still at Tier 5, using Destroyers, and I can tell you the amount of XP and credits you accumulate increase based on the ship tier you're using, so you might get like 300 or 400 at say, Tier 2, before getting 2000 to 3000 at Tier 5. Then again if you think the game's fun and all, it might not be so bad to invest time to grind, but if you're not that kind of person, better decide now whether you want to drop it.Graphics? Ship docks look good. Actual game? Not so much. What, were you expecting some WoW or WT tier graphics?My opinion? The game isn't nearly as close to frustrating me. I just like naval games and try to have fun. :vShould you play it? Well I mean, just because there's a lot of mixed reviews doesn't mean you shouldn't try it out and see for yourself.(NOT SPONSORED BY NAVYFIELD 2)EDIT: So after countless battles, I am now at Tier 7, with ships of different classes also at Tier 7. To be honest, the game isn't really that frustrating once you get used to it, since you win and lose (although you lose more and that's kind of a good thing since XP gain is much faster with losing compared to winning).The grind, however, becomes increasingly harder. And it's more around the amount of XP required for each upgrade before you get to the next ship than the XP gain itself. For me though, it's not a problem, since I enjoy playing the game either way. It gets a bit repetitive here and there, but eventually I managed. With 4 ships at Tier 7 equivalent (under 2 weeks of grinding; 1-3 hours a day), what's to not get bored of? Psst, the maps.			"

												Question #1: is Navy Field 2 a fun game? Absolutely.Question #2: is Navy Field 2 as good as World of Warships? Not in a million years.That really is the truth of the matter. World of Warships beats NF2 in pretty much every category. It has superior historical accuracy, it's more immersive, it has a larger player base, it has better support, more map and game mode variety, and overall is a better game. NF2 is a top down shooter with arcade models; WoWs is a graphically beautiful simulator with serious ships. There really is no contest. If you have a good enough machine and graphics card to play WoWs, stop reading this and go download it....aw hell, that would be too easy. Okay then: here are four things that NF2 does better.1) NF2 has more ships. A LOT more ships. The US Navy, Royal Navy, IJN and Kreigsmarine are all featured, whereas WoWs is still in open beta and only has the US Navy and IJN. With the occasional exception (no King George V-class battleships), all of the notable ships are there-and yes, that includes the Yamato. And yes, those 18 inch guns hurt like hell.2) NF2 has subs. WoWs does not. While some destroyers in WoWs can be savage little ninjas, you only get true stealth in NF2. It is actually fairly well balanced to boot. It's not easy to use a sub well, but when you do, the rewards are spectacular. Equally, it takes time for destroyer drivers to learn how to hunt a sub. When an experienced sub and an experienced destroyer meet, it leads to a tense game of cat-and-mouse.3) Unlike WoWs, which puts similar tiers against each other, there is no such limitation in NF2. It is entirely possible to play your first game in a massive 15v15 match, with a Yamato and an Iowa blazing away at each other which you whizz about in your pokey little beginner destroyer. You really do have no idea what you'll run into when you hit the Battle button, and the possibilities for emergent game experiences are substantial. While that can lead to some difficult games as you fight against higher-tier ships and more experienced players, it can also be quite fun.4) NF2 has decent community, overall. It is absolutely advisable to join a Fleet; like all multiplayer games, it's best played with friends. Doing damage to a Yamato in your tier 1 destroyer is great; distracting a Yamato while your two friends in their battleships sink the monster is even better.I hope that helps. NF2 is fun-just don't expect it to be as good as WoWs.			"

												Well, simply I just love warship games. I would like to play World Of Warships, but I dont have invitation code ;( . Kantai Collection is unreachable for me too. Only Battlestations left (but it's not on multi anyway), so for me only avaiable MMO warship game is Navy Field. I've played NF 1 long time ago, so now it's time to test number '2'. After first hours of gameplay I must admit that second NF is somehow odd for me. I mean game looks better in matter of animations and 3D view, unfortunately ships details are really badly drawed. Very poor compared to NF 1. Another thing is that game is more simplified than NF 1, by saying this I mean, there are much less modifications and items for ships unlike in NF 1, where was plenty of it. Well... automatic aiming is somehow better in version 2. Generally game is average, but for warship fan like me it looks quite more interesting. Anyway, I recommend for try. It's kinda funny.			"

												Navy Field 2 is on Steam now, its pretty neat really. it looks nice visually (at least in comparison to the first game), the gameplay feels a bit different from the first Navy Field game. Otherwise its clearly a Navy field game.  I honestly dont have tons of experience with the series, and I know it mostly through friends who play, and have played it. I was glad this came to steam though so I could give it a try. I should say through there are still some kinks to be worked out, that for sure. Mostly 'quality of life"" fixes. Really though if you like ""navy"" games then you should try Navy Field 2, its not really a simulator or anything but we dont have enough ocean warfare games out there, so this is a welcome addition to Steam I think.

												The game as a MMO offers good team-working gameplay. As a  historical simulation game set in certain period of our history it excellently simulates 2WW-Era naval battles, giving real difference among certain ship classes and their role in battle.There are ofc real cash paid items, as in every freemium games, but they are giving you only a slight advantage.What matters the most is player skills - both tactical, and manual. This scecond plays the bigest role, when you decide to use - in my opinion  the best feature of the game - manual keyboard ship gun aiming control. (in WW2 there were none point&click aiming systems!)The game has some disadvantages, nothing and nobody is perfect,but the devs had shown, that they are really listening the community, making changes that goes straight along players wishes.

												That game had so big potential and what they did? Tier system like in WarThunder or Wargaming's games, removed all ship customization options and gave ships with useless upgrade tree, no possibility to make your own ship and play it you own way. They removed feature which made this game so special and interesting, feature which force players to think about their ships and crews. You had to plan your progress to reach well developed ship in later game.PROS:- now its clicker for players who want to play easy game and kill some time- matchmaker which makes finding games easier- interesting base capture systemCONS:- tiers and upgrade tree killed true NavyFields spirit- lack of armor customization - you had to buy armor increase for 7 days, really?! :D- lack of engine customization- lack of armament customization- lack of ammo customization- lack of crew customization- lack of ANY DAMNED CUSTOMIZATION - just follow stupid schemas and have brainless fun			"

												There's a low play time on my account because it just got released on steam.  That being said I have been playing this since December and have several high tier captains along most all of the branches.This game is fun, and frustrating at times. For example when it rains your accuracy goes to nil in the bigger ships, and it rains a lot so it's very annoying to not be able to hit anything while you are this big ship that's nearly impossible to miss. The items in the store are much too expensive, though they seem to be balancing that. For example when the game first released a premium sailor was somewhere near 1200 gold, now it's better at 300 so I think they are working on that.The game is easy enough to pick up and learn, but a little more difficult to master, especially carrier game play. All in all, the game has it's flaws but it's a fun game to play now and again. 3 stars out of 5 could be better, could be worse, it's all about where they take the game from here.			"

												This is quite a game suitable for almost all computers and players, not much violence, just blasting the crap out of ships, with no blood just explosions, so it's not that violent for younger kids to play.Pros:This game is free, so people with financial problems can still play,You don't need alot of performance, the people with financial problems might have a poor performance laptop or computer, but this game doesn't really need much disk space or performance to run smoothlyThis game is so fun,  it is really fun for everyone, Cons:Graphics not the best ( Well that's good for people with poor PCs)Notes: So this game is really fun as I mentioned, You just pick your country, buy ships, pick lines, unlock and it gets really interesting and addicting.

												All i can say and all i wanna say is WHAT THE FADOODLEHIMER!!!!!! Why is it that I can't log in to the game even if I put in my correct username and password! I only got to play the game ONCE! And even when i did play the game, it's extremely easy to rank up to tier 4 ships. To make things worse, the matching system at that point totally and completely derps the hell out! ""Oh I see you're a tier 4 ship now. Let me put you up againt these tier 10 ships because, y'know, you're such a pro and all.""While I appreciate that you have the confidence that my itty-bitty tincan can take on a death star, it still ends up with my ship cought in between the teeth of those behemoths.

												I personally enjoy this game MUCH more than the first in the series because it simplifies it mcuh more. Where in the last one i would have to look up lot's of tutorials on how to even start off, this tells you pretty much everything you need to know at first. The ships are also much easier to see what exatcly you're putting onto it like guns and specific ammo. One gripe I have is that the Guns don't have an ""all"" fire group maiking it hard to do full on broadsides in Battleships.			"

												Awesome game, highly recommended, and seems to be updated regularly. Pros :    4 different nations    Each faction has unique ship diversity and upgrades    Matchmaking system with a large playerbase.     Game seems to be updated regularly    Skill based - a good player in a lower tier ship can still take on a higher tier ship.Cons:     A bit grindy to unlock some higher tier ships if you are not premium, but nothing over the top.    Manual aiming needs to be reworked to work more like NF1    Armor from the cash shop has slightly better Armor to speed reduction ratio then the free unlockable armors.    Additional officer slots available in the cash shop, giving paying players a small edge.  "

												For NF1 players, gotta keep hoping. I'm an old Jedi member from Navyfield 1 and was excited to play Navyfield 2 since they first announced they were working on it. I really enjoy fast pace strategic games, like Starcraft and such so NF2 was on the list. Two days into it, I have a tier 3 BB with tier 2 DD. The complexity of NF1 is gone, same with the common public player strategies. Everyone rushes in to the middle and it creates a bloodbath, even ships that have far enough ranges to kite rushes in and sinks within seconds. No one hardly speaks on chat but when someone finally did, it was to call me a ""noob bb"" because I was the last one left vs 4 and I was kiting, I was able to sink 3 with lots of hits on others, racking up a simple 98k damage and coming in first place on my team at the end when I was sunk. Thats how we played in NF1(200k dmg+), with other like minded players it became an amazingly fun mental battle. The fact that even the majority of the high tier ships rush in to die in seconds, no dodging or weaving, probably auto aim, possibly bots (no chat or common sense), and some just dont even shoot back makes this games gameplay lame.  The freedom of customized ships is gone and the community feels dead. If you miss NF1 and wanted to play like the old times with just updated graphics, this game is not it.			"

												Naval battles from top down perspective where you unlock more powerful ships as you gain more experience. The good:  quick and fun combat.  loads of ships to unlock . modest hardware requirements. pleasant to look at. requires little to none financial commitment (10 euro's worth of in-game credits will be all you'll ever spend in game)  The bad:  if you choose to play on free account you will gain just a fraction of experience you would have gained if you had  completed the same battles on premuim account.  Premium account on the other hand gives you so much xp bonus that you will reach max level is matter of days. And once you  do, there's nothing much left to do.  "

												For the returning players, This is complete nostalgia! Though there might be some differences here and there, it is quite easy to pick up the pace. For the new players, the tutorials are understandable and easy to learn. The combat system is also not that different from the last game. In-game income and prices are somehow proportional and the level grind is not that grinding (most of the time.)For getting new ships. if you know how world of tanks' research tree then Navy Field 2 has the same mechanic.Overall though, this game is great!

												First - Navy Field 2 feels nice to me.    Different types of ships = different gameplay.   Team based and team dependant.   Simply enough controls, low system reqirements.I can really recommend to try it, despite of enormous flaws.Important: I am playing this game with non-Steam account, and I've played it a year ago (Nexon published). So dont get confused with 0 playtime.Second - I cant recommend this game.Well, seriously - I cant.  There is Pay-to-grind-less - yes. There is Pay-to-WIN - no, but close to, because premium officers have better stats, premium equipment have double stats (+5% accuracy - normal, +10% accuracy - premium one)  - so Visa can give you an edge in fight, and quite a sharp one.  Team based and team dependant - because matchmaking sometimes throws crasy setups in battle (maybe because of low player base).  No information about game mechanics given, players have to figure out everything themselves - and it's costly.  Nice but primitive visuals.  Still bugs in game.  Far from optimal interface (IMO).  Steam account integration problems. Even PROBLEMS.Good game to play for fun.But if you want to max your odds, to get all the advantages - you have to pay. Constantly.So - not recommended for serious players.  "

												This is the Long awaited sequal to Navy Field. This game has more eye candy then the 1st and a much better upgrade tree. It is both challenging and fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone that wants a fun 2D/3D top down naval game that requires you to think, to use teamplay, and enjoys WW2 Naval Ships. As you can see I have has this game for 2 days and already as of the time of this review amassed 9.3 hours of play. That in its self should tell you something.			"

												I've only been playing for about a month and I never played NF1, I just added this to steam with the new patch last week. I don't have a deep knowledge of every aspect of NF2, this is more from a new players perspective. Basically, its a fun game that is flawed. The tutorial is short and nearly useless, but after going through that 2-3 times and playing a dozen or so battles and you get the idea. Once you get the hang of leading targets and using the focus fire you start to settle in pretty fast with the different ship types/playstyles.There is a wide variety of ships in branching trees that work logically for the most part. There are a few ships which seem out of sort with dreadnought-era tiered against others from 20-30 years later but these issues end up moot through balancing. Each ship has upgrades for modules which are limited but do add to your ships capability. Each nation you play will have a crew. As you play your crew levels up. This leveling up leads to an annoying amount of micromanaging after battle as you increase crew skills. As the commander levels up you can also add more officers to yield even better crew stats overall. You can pay for gold officers which yield slightly better bonuses than credit officers. There is also an aid you can buy (both silver and gold ones) which can help you gain XP/credits faster. Then there is the economy. The first 3-4 tiers are pretty easy to unlock. After my first two hours or so I had a BB and CA.  Then it starts to slow down and feel a bit grindy by tier 5-6. Ships start costing a lot more but you don't earn much more XP/creds. Rewards for each game sometimes seem totally random. I have gotten near identical rewards for a game where I died early without landing more than a few shots and another with a few kills where I doubled my HP in damage done. Overall, I like NF2. I can't take it too seriously with the P2W elements (consumables, crew/officers, consumable slots etc), but in my opinion its flaws are outweighed by the fun arcade shoot em up style of game play.

												Sure it's not 3D like another game that seems to have same setup as World of Tanks. Actually alot of things in this game look like World of Tanks.... maybe it was because people were tired of waiting for World of Warships or something. But i have managed to enjoy this game. despite the GRIND! Ok, and maybe the tutorials could use help, firing at enemy ships requires time to get used to. (yes paitence is neededIt's not like WoT where you need to aim higher to hit them, actually you just need to have the one of the circles (number of circles depend on ship) a little ahead of the ship. (taking account the distance your at, your movement, and the enemy's movement) It's actually not that hard to shoot that's until your ADHD kicks in then you just don't care anymore, and probably at this point you aren't listening to me....But all in all, it's a good game if graphics aren't your #1 concern, and you like to swivel about in a swashbuckling battleship shooting like a highly funtional maniac winning big creds for your team (idk it depends). And i did only play this for today but i thought it was good for a first-ish impression.			"

												I may have played only a little bit of it, and personally I'm not enjoying myself much. The engine seems OK and if you can get used to finnecky controls you could probably learn to play this game with not much trouble. But myself I don't really like it. I fell like it's riddled with too many minor design flaws that, while not breaking the game, really show how unpolished this is. For example, you aim with LMB and fire with spacebar. Well, why not give the players the option to, I dunno, rebind the fire to RMB? Just a suggestion.But yeah, battles are decently fun once you learn how to do what. The pace is much slower than something like, I dunno, TF2, but rapid enough to feel action packed, especially for a naval simulation game, while at the same time not as slow as I dunno, World of Tanks. Why did I bring it up? Because it seems to follow a similar economy model.If only he controls were a little more responsive, I'd play this game, but hey it's got potential.			"

												I like this game a lot!It's quite simple as it stands. I used to play NF1, which was much more complex. That said, it's clear that several features are still being worked on in NF2 and will be released at a later time.Also, the ducumenation, tutorials, and tool tips suck in this game currently. No hard stats are available anywhere, and I'm still finding out new features that exist by reading the forums, etc. This stuff should be explained in-game clearly. It's not even clear is some features are active or not.I am having fun playing this game and I hope to see it evolve to be even better than NF1!			"

												Love the game, once you get past the first few ships, learn the game, and level up, it is one of the most addicting games out there.  There will be some battles where you feel like you are on PCP doing 170 mph (not that I've done PCP), it can be intense, and requires a good bit of tactics.			"

												For reference - Time played on steam =/= time in game. The launcher is what steam counts as time played. I have played close to 40 hours while writing this.I recommend this game. This is a fun game and is a straight upgrade from NF1 in many ways while kind of a let down in other ways. Seeing as all of maybe 10k people even played the first NF I will write this review from a new experience standpoint.From a brand new experience, this game is fun. The ship progression finally makes sense. The ship models are neat.  The game mechanics are solid. Server lag is minimal in my 40ish hours of gameplay. Since the game is free, I seriously doubt seeing anyone having a bad time right off the bat with this game.The only actual problems in the game lay withing the EXP system. Seeing as most of your games will be losses since leaving the game before it's over is an automatic loss, exp rates are kind of slow(there is bonus EXP for a W). This is compensated by the exp needed for the next tier ships not being that much until you try and get a T11 ship. Then the EXP is rediculous for something not much better than a T9 or T10. Subs are an issue too, but any halfway competent DD player can quickly kill submarines. TL;DR Fun game, worth a download since the download is less than a gig of space. Give it a try.			"

												This game is pretty fun but as a person who played alot of Navyfield 1 they seemd to have dumbed it down alot. I wish the economy system would reward damage over kills due to the fact there is a reward system for getting kills in matches which leads to alot of kill stealing. Doing that would not make the economy kinda feel broken in the game where you easily outgain you credits while getting xp unless you are constantly getting kills.			"

												Long anticipated release answered by great disappointment. You would have thought the game would have come some ways from its 2013 beta release. -Note: play time shows nil, but I've been on it before steam release.-The game revolves around a tedious upward grind on different ship trees, some required to unlock another class (ex. Play as destroyer, unlock heavy cruiser, then unlock carriers). To unlock the next ships, you have to research a string of ""upgrades"" until next ship is available for research in the end. Quotations around ""research"" because they seem to have been chosen at random for each ship or are just meaningless (like gun or boiler upgrades that cost you thousands of exp but improves absolutely nothing). Each tier of each class consists of only one ship and even though the first ships come fast, gameplay eventually gets stale and boring. Wasn't a fan of Warthunder but at least they had more variety with several vehicles per tier.Towards the endgame, exp walls take on an exponential climb. If you're a free user, its very unlikely that you'll ever get to touch the endgame ships. And before any SDE fanboy chimes in with ""Stop whining, NF1's grind was even worse, this is nothing"", then you're missing the point. Anyone can make a game model focusing entirely on a neverending grindfest (with cash/premium shortcuts of course!). It takes very little effort and imagination but it still seems good at raking in the cash from the whales.Ingame:  Depending on ship, controls can be a bit clumsy and matches are always unbalanced to the point of being rigged. Don't be surprised to have your 1895 heavy cruiser facing Battleship Yamato or your submarine 1v2 against a pair of Destroyers on a tiny map. You don't see much teamwork either and ships rarely tend to play on their ship's main roles. And why would they seeing as how the game rewards all the same regardless of what you're doing. Despite the different classes, they all virtually play the same: cap a base, go deal as much damage as you can,  die/kill yourself, then quit back to lobby. Repeat. The faster you get at this, the faster you can progress. Without premium, however, it feels more like you're in a hamster wheel.Surprised this isn't listed as an early release or beta as there's still some bugs. Some aspects like endgame rewards don't even make sense at times. Players that carried team often get rewarded less than the exp farmers who torpedo rush suicide or guys hanging out back taking random potshots. I guess its a work in progress and they'll iron it all out eventually. Right after they release that new set of ship skins in cash shop.It wasn't all bad though. The music is okay I guess. It doesn't get as annoying as NF1's. The ship descriptions were interesting. I haven't tried World of warships yet but from the videos I've seen it looks like a lot more action going on over there. The only people I'd see recommending this with a straight face are diehard armchair admirals who care nothing about gameplay quality or SDE fanboys and suck ups. To everyone else, I'd look elsewhere.			"

												The particularity of this game is the 3rd person view so you are not stuck in your ship (like World of Warships) but you can see all the map (there is fog of war where you and your allies don’t see). I was searching for a game like that for quite a long time, NF2 is the only one I found. Now, the game:There is no tutorial or sandbox, so get ready to lose your first battles trying to understand how to use your ship. The community may help, using chat or websites giving advices and tips. Otherwise, learn by yourself!Controlling ship is however quite simple, it’s an arcade game. Submarine and Carrier Vessel are harder to control, but have a more interesting value.Graphics are basic too, good point is you can play with a really cheap PC. No damage control (except when low life: you’re slower) so be sure to sink your enemy or he keeps his firepower ;)With one account you may have 6 captains from 4 different countries (US, UK, Germany and Japan, quite balanced) but you won’t be able to up them all unless you spent a huge time on this game.Tech tree isn’t really friendly: some ships are less powerful than the previous rank, and high tier ships require a lot of experience. However, there are nice ships easier to get and enjoyable.Matchmaking is… strange: you may have 10 vs 10 battles (max I saw is 16 vs 16) but you also may get 1 vs 1 or even 1 vs 2… You can play with 2 friends, but you may face other teams, with bigger ships… or far less powerful ones.It’s a free-to-play but I think 2-3 players spent a quite huge amount of money to have such powerful ships… Just avoid those guys and you’ll get interesting battles.The User Interface is a joke: nothing is explained so ask the community or find what you search on internet, chat often goes down, etc.To conclude, how to rate a game both that good and that bad?If you search a naval arcade F2P with intense and quick battles, welcome at NF2!It has a great potential and devs are still working on the game so they will eventually fix major problems (UI, matchmaking) before everyone leaves to find a better game…			"

I have played a decent amount on this, and I will continue to play it. It still has a grindy feel at times, credits are difficult to earn, and you run through the ships pretty quick. Its a good time filler, good graphics, if you dont pay to win, you will be at a disadvantage. But, all in all, it is what it is...I enjoy it. "

												Hmm...not really a polite way to put this. NF2, I am disappointed. I spent 100s of hours, and $100's of $$$ on the Original Navyfield. Frankly, the original took me by surprise. As a hardcore 1st person pov simulator fan, I would not even have given Navyfield a chance had I not been invited by some AA clan buddies. Once I started, I could'nt stop. It amazed me how such a graphically simple, top down view game could put its hooks into me so successfully. So of course after having discovered there was a Navyfield 2, and on Steam (which I now have embraced), I could not download it fast enough. My first thoughts are here in list format:- Why can't I skip this damn tutorial?- Did I download the wrong game?- Why is the background music so friggen loud and why cant I change it? Oh yeah, forced into tutorial!- Yay! Done with tutorial... what about recruiting an aide? How? Oh does it cost money? Can tell, oh well, skip it- Into battle.... did I hit a time acceleration button somewhere?- Why do the graphics look just like Navyfield I ?- Why are the ships turning around like go karts flying around a track?And lastely... - Where did I put that Navyfiled I installer again... I hope all my old premium stuff I paid so much money for is still there!!- Navyfield II first experience compelled me to stop playing, not continue and as a Veteran to the franchise left me with a strong sense of disappointment. Like when Disney bought Lucas franchise.If your new to NF, this might not seem to bad, but if you are not new... you will be asking yourself, why in the world would I want to play this?			"

												Navy Field 2 is a battleship game filled with detail, water and big battleships. I would recommend this game on the basisthat it is fun to play for a little while, but after playing it for a bit you realize your going to be playing for a long timebefore getting a ship worthy of the seas. Since I still had an epic time blowing up submarines and battleships, I hopeothers can have the same fun.7/10			"

												Well, if you don't like WoWs (because of its lack of content, ripoff business practices and low skill requirements), go try Steel Ocean. That game is everything Navyfield 2 wanted to be, but failed. Started slow in November, and getting much better now (grapics, ship handling, content). Fleet battles are good fun, and there are a number of original Navyfield veterans on (Vikings fleet with people I saw around 2008). That's a good sign.I've been trying out this poor excuse of ""NF2"" here since 2013 (Nexon times...). It is time now that it is laid to rest :D			"

												As pretty much the only submarine player on the Washington server, its heavily weighed against you. Maps are huge, barely any time to stay underwater, torpedoes barely damage anyone who buys bulge armor, completely vulnerable at periscope depth to pretty much every surface vessel, not to mention no snorkels so even at periscope depth, you're losing oxygen. Not to mention there is either a hack or a bug that lets capital ships without having or using sonar to track you at depth below periscope depth accurately. There is also a bug where the sub randomly does not have to surface pretty much indefinitely. Pretty much any stealth advantage is sometimes flat out negated. Not to mention, sonar doesn't work both ways in game, i.e., I as a submarine cant use sonar to detect surface targets, especially since your surface field of view becomes almost as small as your ship at depths deeper than 3. Pros: its visually pleasing, and the nationalities speaking their mother tongues is a cool touch.Cons: It's neither as fun nor playable as NF1 (which is still online, mind you), and it's still somewhat buggy.I'm still going to recommend it because maybe if more people actually played, there'd me a more active following by the devs.			"

												Finished the game (uninstalled) in 38 minutes. That's including all the DLC (updates)That has to be a record!Its not too bad. I might come back to it if I'm bored. Looks like a pretty competent ship sim that's a bit like World of tanks but with more mouse clicking, maybe a little unwieldy but all the controls are there. Its not Sid Meiers' Pirates pick-up-and-playable. Not by about a billion light years because there are a lot of controls and I didn't want to learn them today. Overall verdict: not for me today, its a bit like World of Tanks.			"

												TL;DR:Limited content + grind = boring grind. Player is very limited by things such as barracks space, which can only be expanded by premium currency, but even then at very high costs. P2W items available.===Feels like a shell of a game. A lot of interesting aspects have been dumbed down considerably. Going through the research trees is a dull and grindy process, made worse by the linear upgrades instead of being able to actually change parts of your ships, i.e. the weaponry.Extremely limited barracks space, 5 ship slots, with some heavy price tags on expanding, and even more insane price tags on stat resetting. (2500 gold for a single crew member. I believe you get 625 gold for $4? You've got a bare minimum of 12 crew members. Go figure...) All this makes it impossible for the free player to focus on more than a single type of ship, meaning if your main is a battleship, and you want to have some fun with a carrier or sneak around in a submarine you'll be a lot less effective at it, which partially ruins the fun of it.Also means that you'll pay dearly one way or another for a single mistake during the stat distribution process. Either due to not knowing about all the limitations such as barracks space, because you misjudged the best stat, or change your mind about what path to take... Or even because you did not first heavily research everything in the tech tree and for example now finding out the final ship in your chosen tree is more focused on deck weaponry, not torpedo's. While previous ships were obviously floating torpedo platforms... Just saying...Few maps and even fewer unique situations make the game very repetetive, very quickly. While a grindy feeling is unavoidable in games like these, this only makes it much worse.By definition, the game is P2W. There are boosts available which can give in-game advantage a free player can never get. The free player is limited to the 5% stat increase items, with a relatively large speed decrease, while paying players can get the 10% stat increase items, with a low speed decrease. You can apply a lot of boosts at any single time, making the gap wider. That said, the P2W items should be of minor influence in most situations, but P2W is P2W.They should have paid more attention to World of Tanks's model, as a lot of copied directly out of WoT, but not very well.

												In a scenario where you have a monsterous battleship against a tiny destroyer boat, who would win?Then why in god's name are you in your tiny little teir 2-3 ship even in the same game as people with boats from the late game?Not only is the matchmaking poorly designed, the game has severe imbalances in it as well.A volley of torpedos that are unavoidalbe for the larger ships are primed almost as soon as they hit the water.Carriers can send an unavoidable squad of divebombers quickly deposing of even the strongest ship.Anti-Air is just innefective and impossible to aim.It is, in my opinion superior to the preceding game in respects to both how far spending money on the game influences your games, and despite my earlier criticism on the matchmaking - still superior (it was really that bad).

												I played the original NF years ago and found it to be an enjoyable timesink but with a bit too much grind.  After one of my friends informed me and NF2 had come out I decided to give it a go.  After I saw the Steam reviews I got a bit squemish about getting it but I have been happy with this game thus far.  This is a good navel fighting game (not a sim) with fun battles where you can always make a differnce with your ship if you have the skill.  It is NOT pay to win.  It has some stat boosts for purchase and they may help slightly but its not whats going to win the games for you, its your skills.NF2 has a great quick progression till you hit Tier 5 and then it jumps up in grind but you will at that point a solid ship of the line that can really contribute to the battle in a major way.I recommend this if you don't mind a bit of grind and some outdated overhead graphics.

It lacks some features like giving orders over the minimap and other minor things that are just... well, weird. No collision, and if you sail into an island you're getting magically towed backwards the way you came. It feels weird.But it's bloody fun. And that's what counts.

												The game over all is kinda ""meh""Combat is entertaining while music is a bit forgetable, and visuals are a tad dated. Selecting certain graphics options together can cause frame rate issues, though this will likely be fixed at some point.I'd give this game a thumbs up but due to the current balancing, I cannot.I witnessed a single submarine destroying my entire team, staying submerged and invisible for 30 seconds at a time just to pop up next to an ally and sink them with a barrage of torpedos.. then submerging immediately and repeating the cycle. Submarines should not be able to submerge so quickly after attacking.Until the game undergoes a few balance checks, this will remain a resounding ""No.""			"

												46 hours in, and for the most part the game is fun.  Big differences between this version and NF1:1.  No Gun options, what it comes with is what you get.  Most ships you can upgrade the guns for more damage, better accuracy, and faster reload, but it feels to be a major ""miss"" when compared to NF1's modifications.2.  No Premium Ships currently.  This is good and bad at the same time, as in NF1's premium ships were by no means a ""pay to win"" option, but if you got good with them they did help you grind a bit faster.3.  Manual aiming is a huge pain in the A.  Not sure if it's the quicker speed of the game (all ships feel like they are moving at lightspeed in comparison) and manual aiming is too slow.  Combine that with any amount of lagging at all, and you end up with a big loss.  I only ever used auto aim for a few cl's and ca's in NF1, but in this version I haven't managed over 20K damage with manual aim mode.  Maybe it's better with bigger boats, but I'm kinda doubting it.4.  Lag, lock-ups, and another loss.   Any time you ""Retreat"" or have to Quit the game due to your game lagging out and then freezing, the game counts that battle in your win/loss record as a loss.  Not a big deal if you don't care, but NF1 a lot of us prided ourselves in having a 60-75% Win ratio.  Not possible to maintain that with 5-10 auto losses in a 4 hour sitting due to servers gumming up.  And it's not player's computer, as it seems to be affecting everyone equally, no matter system specs.All in all, the game is fun.  But with the many issues, frustrations, and annoyances, it's just not worth putting any money into the game.  Give it a go maybe if you have some time to kill, but I would give this title a pass.

												Such an amazing game! All I suggest is that they improve the graphics a little. Running on max and it doesnt look the best. But if your into World of Tanks or War Thunder, and your thinking of playing World of Warships when its released. Then I suggest you play this while you wait			"

												Horrible graphics and isn't really a strategy game as the perspective is some weird sudo third person, but has good game mechanics and a wide variety of ships, it has also integrated its paid feature well so that it doesn’t give  premium players too much of an advantage but its defiantly pay to win at the moment			"

												This is a game I wanted to like.  I really loved NF1 played it forever and liked it for its uniqueness.Now the genre isn't quiet so empty, here we have NF2, World of Warships is coming out, and presumably more are to come.NF2 to me felt like a dumbed down, simpler, and easier NF1.  Its exactly what I didn't want.  I would have been thrilled at the prospect of a modeled and rebalanced NF1.  Instead we got rid of manual aiming and everything is now auto-aim to some degree which really removed a great amount of player skill from the game.  They just really missed the mark in my opinion, a large part of what made NF1 great even for people not a fan of ships was the interesting and skill oriented aiming system by removing this they effectively removed the main skill from the game.  It feels more like an easy cash farmer now, the sort of f2p program shoved out to make a dime not be a great game.  So its with a great amount of disappointment I'll say I can't recommend this game.			"

												Im not sure I would recommend spending any money on this game, mainly because I cant yet play it. If you can actually get into the game and try it good on you because Ive been trying to check it out for 3 days but they cant even get emailing and log in right for the free version. I followed the instuctions explicitly regarding steam users and accounts to no avail. No help from the ""tech support"" they provide, they cant even seem to send me an  email to reset my account info despite the fact that they according to them they in fact have my email registered.The really sad part is if I had known it was hosted by Trion Worlds I never would have tried to play to begin with as they are the absolute worst in terms of customer service and interaction. I have almost never played a game from them where there isnt some sort of issue like this. They will happily take money from you for micro transactions you cant use however. So mia culpa for not looking more into a games publisher before downloading. At least I hadnt spent any money so all in all  it could have been worse.			"

												hahaha... wow... it's the navy version of WoT oh how i hate it so.. first match i get in a midget destroyer and it places me against aircraft carriers and battleships... GGUPDATE (not even 30 minutes later)... OK im done... if people want to ♥♥♥♥ themselves hours upon end im not following on the ♥♥♥♥ train.. i'm sick of MOBA/♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T games.... I quit WoT because of the amount of higher tiers and not even being able to touch them.. this is even more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t... Battleships vs beginner destroyer with barly any dmg... how well is that going to go..I'm not fully bashing on the game, the idea was wonderful, it brought WoW before it even came out in fact, i think this would be its little brother.. But when it combines WoT's broken tier system it is hell on earth for new people who don't know what their doing. Devs, give the new players a chance to fight and put them into their own tier, follow War Thunder's system, A. it will get you a lot more players possibly, B. It's more of a chance to have people who will sign on daily instead of for 5 minutes play one match then get off and never come back like me.i'm sorry if this review seems like i'm complately against it and want to keep people away from it. If you play WoT jump right on in you'll feel right at home. i myself am not a WoT person, i haven't even got to tier 2 yet in it and i played for 2 months almost every day. It was because when i DO get a kill, it's either the person is a complete moron and runs around like a chicken with it's head cut off or the guy is AFK.. Otherwise its the other way around and i end up getting made target practice. I have better odds on War thunder as i'm in a tiger and working on a king tiger, it took me only 2 months to get that tank and it's tier 3 in fact  late tier 3.. i get a kill 100% each game i play unless either i mess up my loadout or i get a tier ahead of me that completely dominates *rarely happens* but anyway enough with my stories...I would say if you like WoT give this a try... For anyone who hates that game move along. i stick with my opinion that this game SUCKS			"

												I was fan of NF1. But this is realy bad clone.  It have worst MM i ever seen. No fun trying to win when you group have  top Battle ship from T5 -6 and enemy have T8-9 and this situation is normal...  Manual aming (NF1 veteran know) dont work becose ships are faster. Progresion system looks good from start until you hit credit wall around T5-6 them its horrryble grind.   Dont waste money here.  Avoid like plague.			"

												Bugs, bugs, and stupid rules.Simple example - my ship is sunk, i end battle i get info battle lost. Why? Battle still dont end just game dont follow battle.Pay options - but something for few days?? Additional armour?Dont waste time, and dont play that game.Gry nie polecam - masa błędów i głupich zasad.Prosty przykład - tracisz okręt, wychodzisz z gry - gra od razu ustala ci wynik - przegrana,a  tak naprawdę bitwa dalej trwa.Opcje płatne? Terminowe - kupujesz dodatkowy pancerz którzy np. po 7 dniach znika...Nie marnujcie czasu i nie grajcie w tą grę.			"

												This game is not a battle of wits or tactics or anything sensible in a naval warfare MMO game, rather the outcome of all battles is down to two things.1. Who has the most health2. Who has better firepowerThere is a recipe for doing well in this game, and those who follow it will win everytime, there is no room for diversity, all your team has to do is launch an enromous volley of torpedoes, and let the battleships camp beyond enemy view range. Vview range as a whole is a pointless idea in maps as small as this, real life warships could make out an enemy ship that was at the edge of the horizon. Any kind of tactics or flanking or whatever will get you not only killed, but swarmed by torpedoe spamming destroyers. In this game numbers win regarless of the ship you sail, or the skill you have. The matchmaking is such bulls**t that you will often run into boats twice your size, and your in a battleship. Personally I don't get the point of the aiming in this game, why can't a normal mouse aim be suffiecent?. Lastly submarines are overpowered to a point where a single one can kill two cruisers, with one torpedoe, and the AA guns are useless, they don't actually shoot at enemy aircraft until they attck you, by then it's too late. Thank god I didn't have to waste money on this game, and the way World of Warships is going, I know what game I'll have on my desktop.			"

												Iv looked at a lot of the reviews and a lot of them state it taking ages to sign up id like to ask ... what internet are you even using as it took me all of 2 clicks and 5 standard fill in box's Stop over exagerating.=== Review Starts Now ===Now dont get me wrong if your looking for a serious naval combat game with simulation style movements you are looking at the wrong game.If your looking for fast paced gameplay your also looking at the wrong game.The problem with navyfield is it never has been a mainstream F2P game it was always a bit more of a blackmarket of f2p games. The graphics are pretty compareable to the first game apart from the graphics in any of the menu's they have for some odd reason been improved. There are P2W features but its a F2P game and im sick of people giving games bad rep because they have a cash market. How else do you stupid idiotic creatures think these F2P games can afford to stay open and F2P.The game its self is rather basic on the controls its your typical WASD with your left and right mouse clicks... and a few other buttons dashed about.Gameplay feels a lot like the original but with slightly nicer graphics which isnt a bad thing really being as there wasnt really anything wrong with the original games Gameplay.All in all i think its the original game in a new shiney package with some major improvements7/10===Just a warning This game is a very tactical game when you get further into it so id advise finding some friends to play it with to team up and do some wrecking			"

												Forget this.  Was looking to take a look at the game and see how it played for a possibly lets play and review but after a half hour of dealing with restrictive screen name parameters, downloading, having to leave three times to ""retrieve codes"", ""confirm email"" and back and forth only to get in and have to download the actual game with ""2 hours remaining"".  NOPE.  I have better things to do with my time and this game already has some nasty mixed reviews.  I noped out because it reminds me of a saying I've heard many times concerning free to plays and often found true, ""they charge what they think they can for the game"".  Glad I did not pay anything so I can go on to something else without loosing anything but a half hour research or editing time.			"

												This game is NOT massively multiplayer, there are only a few players in a given match threw a match making algorithm.An MMO, or massively multiplayer online game, is a game that thousands of participants can play simultaneously over the internet.This game basically World of Tanks with ships, only allot slower. The aiming is a 2 part endeavor Right click to rotate, Space bar to shoot. Speed is managed by tapping W up for speed and S down to slow down or reverse. The controls of this game could have been greatly improved. Again 1 match at least I finished this one, Debating on a uninstall.IMO it was a waste of my bandwidth... and a waste of disk space.			"

												To start I never played NF1.  I started playing NF2 on steam launch day and had an absolute blast.  Most players were in Destroyers since so many were new, like me, so while variety was lacking it was a level playing field.  By the weekend I was in games that had all ships and let me tell you it sucks trying to figure out your role and how to beat/avoid each enemy ship with so little info about the game and no team work but if you persevere you do learn.  However too many experienced players just rush for quick games bse it is infinitly easier to farm XP and in game currency credits to die quick then try.  Alternately all the new players try to hide behind each other and this is its own problem since the match maker is god aweful at the moment.  I have a level 50 and level 70 captain, highest tier ship is 6 and I am constantly facing tier 8-10 ships which chew up lower tier ships easily.  It is akin to say a level 95 player in World of Warcraft facing off against a level 100.  Assuming equal skill you simply cant beat a ship with 50% more health and damage (Not even including real money items), and thats what youll face most games.  I have even seen countless games they put Tier 2 and 3 ships in to play against Tier 9 and 10 .. seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  Which leads to the last and most important point.  It is absolutely pay to win and here is why.  All of the ship upgrades you can buy with credits earned in battle are half as effective as real money versions (Accuracy and speed make or break your success and real money buys you more of both).  Real money gets you a temporary premium account giving you a 50% boost to XP and credits which may not sound huge but when you have to do 500-700 battles to afford the next tier ship, well you can do the math.  Premium also unlocks 8 officer slots, though to be fair you can buy 1 day of premium and they stay unlocked.  Real money can also buy 100k Credits which atm is generally what is holding your advancement back.  Lastly real money can make your officers vastly superior giving your ship additional buffs through officer morale items.TLDR and in closing .. until they fix the match making and give a reason for your whole team to actually try to win this game will just be a massive grind of getting owned repeatedly until you either spend or it is nearly Christmas and youve finally lost enough games to get a tier 9 or 10 ship.

												As a former player of the original Navyfield,  I do not recommend this. The excessive amount of pay2win content will make any fight against paying players a suicide. It is not uncommon to see half of your team reaped by these players. The graphics will let you down as well, not to mention the high usage of computer resources to achieve them.If you want a strategic naval combat game, stick to the original Navyfield.			"

												This game is a good placeholder until world of warships.   Also, it's not a MMO - It's a MOBA.  There is no open world anything, nor are there any aspects of a traditional MMO other than player guilds which are called fleets..  There is just simple matchmaking with about 5 different maps, which qualifies the game as a MOBA.			"

												This game is NOT massively multiplayer, there are only a few players in a given match threw a match making algorithm.An MMO, or massively multiplayer online game, is a game that thousands of participants can play simultaneously over the internet.This game basically World of Tanks with ships, only allot slower. The aiming is a 2 part endeavor Right click to rotate, Space bar to shoot. Speed is managed by tapping W up for speed and S down to slow down or reverse. The controls of this game could have been greatly improved. Again 1 match at least I finished this one, Debating on a uninstall.IMO it was a waste of my bandwidth... and a waste of disk space.			"

												If you are prepared to spend about 200 pounds/dollars to get anywhere in this game you should definitly get it !Otherwise you will have to be prepared to spend about 200 hours of gameplay constantly losing against high tier ships until you can get one of your own and then try your luck in a game that is kind of fair. I say kind of fair because there are always higher tier ships to sink you straight away. You will just have to avoid them at all costs. or spend another 200 pounds/dollars to get these higher tier ships... or another 200 hours... the choice is yours !My score is World of Tanks on the sea in 2D.If you enjoy something like that be free to download the game.Update: Bought a bundle to check out some of the premium features.. After few calculations.. I figured out you need at least 500 pounds worth of premium currency to get anywhere in the game.Companies poop those ""free to play"" games like they ate a bad burrito nowdays...			"

												The gameplay in this game feels like it could be good. With a somewhat competent tutorial you probably could've easily understood how to play the game. Too bad your just given a few guides and are slapped on the back.With a somewhat decent ship you probably could do something against others. Too bad your given a rustbucket that will die as soon as it touches water with water pistols instead of cannons. Did I mention that the guns feel like water pistols? They are horribly innacurate and often dont even travel as far as the game says they should. Ever feel like you earned a level up? Well thanks to the fact that your up against fully upgraded, max rank ships you never will! You are just handed level ups, experience, and money just for showing up which does nothing to deter people from just showing up and afking for experience and credits until they can get a max rank ship, and I don't blame them. With the way progression works you can't just get any type of ship you want. You either have to pay a premium or research through a long tree before you may be able to get the lowest tier of a ship that you may not even like playing. The actual gameplay is fairly fun, but you'll be shot out of the water exceedingly quickly if you even dare going into a battle. Have a group of people with you who can survive for awhile and you will just watch or alt tab as you watch... and do nothing else. My most horrendous bone to pick with this game however is the fact that it pretty much punishes new players for being new. You want to play against a veteran? Well even if the veteran stands perfectly still and lets you shoot him with 100% accuracy thanks to the progression system you'll run out of ammo before the guy even gets to half health. You want to play a battleship and an air carrier? Well get ready to pay way too much money or sink hours into the game so you can get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tier 1 ships of both just to figure out that you hate both ships. want to go to the front line? Well either have really fast movement or really really thick hull or your just going to die, but thanks to the progression system you wont have any ships that are fast enough or tanky enough to do anything. To summarize:Bad TutorialsAggrivating controlsMatches dumb mice against intelligent lionsExceedingly limited ship choicePUNISHES NEW PLAYERS FOR BEING NEW "

												Not often does a game launch and come across as a scam within the first few minutes. First off - no game should request or be permitted to be hosted on steam and request provision of steam account credentials to create an account. Checking the IP registration for the game's domain returns a registrant email tied to a host of Korea-based exploitation/hacking threads from 2011 and 2013. Not for nothing, but I'm not going to waste a minute of my time playing a game that a) comes across like a poorly coded identity theft scam on its external web-based registration page and b)has a domain registrant associated with massive amounts of sketchy threads going back to 2011 from users complaining about abusive and unpleasant experiences with the parent company/publisher - SDEnternet Co Ltd (Seoul, Korea based game developer). Total lifespan of this game on my hard drive - 5 minutes, 45 seconds.			"

												Navy Field 2: Conqueror of the Ocean is a really unique game that I enjoyed for its different style of gameplay. The over-the-top camera with the RTS movement style and rather difficult but enjoyable shooting mechanics, it leaves this game an enjoyable and competitive multiplayer game.The only negatives I can think about is personal and that is that I’m not very found of multiplayer games where the objective is just to kill (with exception of CSGO and Ghost Recon Phantoms), I prefer story which this game has none of (unless you say that the era this game was based in, WWII, was the story).Overall, if you are looking for a fun multiplayer game to pick up and play, I recommend this!

												Sound effects are terrible, controls are terrible, terrible lag, no idea if shells actually hit anything, dude warns you that planes, torpedoes, or ships have been sighted moments before you are hit by them, if at all.  Match making pairs tier one destroyers with battleshipsProgression is all in a line like WOT want this ship? You have to use these 3 specific ships and upgrade their guns to get it. I wouldn't mind so much if I could customize my ship at all like in the first game. But you cant. they made all the upgrades feel the same. Progression is also♥♥♥♥♥♥easy. Play two matches, die almost instantly, here is more than enough credits and exp to buy the next ship. Who cares right?Pay to winWhy do people play this? The first navy field is better, by far, go play that. Or idk I think world or warships is in open beta now try that just avoid this.			"

												Mixed reviews on this game. Took a gamble and bought it. Love the game play. Easy to play and get a handle of the controls. As ever its the tactics that win the game. I really enjoy it.I've seen a lot of negative feed back about the players and the tier system. I got no issues with it. Sometimes you have a losing streak some times you can't be touched. Sometimes you can play against an organised team and get steam rolled. Just like any other MMO. I joined a team of nice people and haven't had a bag experience.  "

												Wanna try your hand at the Naval combat? Well her ya go this game gives you sveral tiers ship starting at one and leveling up to a max tier. Upgrades will greatly benefit your ship as you progress. Teams and battle are interesting and thier certainly a ton of controls you will need to learn in order to play well. The graphics and other various details are also very neatly done and makes for an estatically pleasing game. This game I would say it is realitively fun with some patience and time.			"

												This game Doesn't have the feel of a real strategic ship simulation. For geeky guys like me it seems like a kids game. I only played it a short time and don't find enough realism in the decision making to try it further. The last time I played it I found it frustrating to have to wait for a battle and this was the straw that gave my camel a backache. It seems to me that a single player mode would be great if there are no battles to enter. But then I don't know the game well enough to critisize it fairly. It didn't have enough geek allure to justify more time in it. The submarine simulation was why I tried it out, but apparently you have to build up more gold or credits to command one, and I assume that it would have been as half baked  as the destroyer. What happened to accurate sub simulartors? In order to play one you have to accept what was in the past without the advantages of current computer and graphics hardware.NOT FOR GEEKS			"

												I was a big fan of Navy Field 1, but this game suffers a lot from poor design of both gameplay and user interface. It's simultaneously more confusing and has less depth than the original.Not to mention, the best strategy to move up the tiers of ships is to simply die as fast as possible each round, with no reason to get better at it.

												I assume at some point in this game's past, some major aspect of the game changed; the number of negative reviews seems unwarrented from my two days (so far) of playing. Sure, the MM is a little strange at times and every so often you get battles that one team is seemingly heavily stacked - but even then it is possible to win. But onto the actual game.It has an arcady feel that, despite the drastically different camera angles and graphics, distinctly reminded me of Battlestations: Midway. Perhaps it's just because of it being an arcade, ship based game, but it doesn't really matter; as I played more I began to enjoy myself more and more. I initially intended to simply play a while whilst another game was in a prolonged maintainence, however this quickly changed into playing it heavily.Initially you start off in an early (often pre-WWI) ship, for the first few tiers you can expect to unlock new ships pretty regularly, I think I'm up to Tier VI as of this review in approximately 10 hours of playing (half way to seven, but I'm probably going to change tree which will slow me). You can chose from 4 nations, with each nation having a relatively balanced tree, whilst still maintaining some national traits (Japanese Torpedos are really, really good for example). Whilst from what I gather the grind starts to become more noticeable from tier V onwards, I've already claimed a couple of tier IX, X and XI ships in my little destroyer and my CA just claimed a high end BB.Which brings me to the MM - yes you get put in battles against high tier ships when you are playing low tier ships. And honestly? If you don't like the concept of merely being a cog in the machine for your team, this might not be the game for you. That said, I loved the challenge of having to take an early destroyer up against teams with Yamatos and Vanguards, and thus I see no issue with the MM. The biggest problem at the moment is slow queue times - but they aren't unbearably bad and at some times of the day you can get matches with decent frequency.The graphics are a little poor - but really, they don't need to be any better, and the visuals are more than adequate for the game. The audio however is good - especially the music which fits the gameplay very well. The UI is a little complicated, and the extremely minimal tutorial you get means you are rather required to ask other players for explanations on certain things; but unlike most of these types of games, the community is helpful.Speaking of the community - not only are they helpful as mentioned above, but also there is far, far less rage than in most online games, all of my matches thus far have been with light hearted people who often laugh at silly mistakes rather than screaming at you. Additionally, in several battles where I've been chasing the last surviving enemy in my DD, high tier BBs have allowed me to score the kill rather than taking it for themselves (which they could easily do) which speaks to a far greater level of decency than I've come to expect from online games.On a final note, the F2P model in this game is instantly recognisable as a fair model - so far as I can tell, there is virtually nothing that is exclusively bought with gold, meaning you are never outclassed by premium vehicles, and never need to buy premium vehicles to sustain yourself, in addition to this the economy seems relatively generous - there are no repair bills, meaning no real drain on your credits other than things you chose to buy.Overall - if you enjoy the challenge and the thought of tactical naval battles, and don't mind the queue times and occasionally unfair matchmaking, this game is definitely worth trying. I had hesitated over downloading it because of reading the negative reviews - my experience of being seal clubbed in other WWII combat games by higher tiers put me off greatly when I read about people fighting tier XI ships with tier II ships, but now that I've tried it, I'm glad that I did as it was certainly worth trying. Seeing as it's free even if you are uncertain - it could be worth downloading and trying it for yourself rather than listening to any review (including my own.)			"

												I would like to say, after being a huge fan of the first game. I am VERY dissappointed.No more ship customization like the first game.Spent 10 minutes waiting for a game......I just quit.Chat was filled with children who had mouths that are filled with sludge.\Its a horrible World of Tanks Clone.

												Navyfield 2 is the Real Navy Game to play for the long run!1. You control your future!!In other words, easy to master controls and you can overturn outcome of a match with your own skills!Not like other naval games where you only have 50% or less chance of winning even if you are a great player!2. Great Balance!You have real balance in that you have real armament!In other words, if you are a Battleship you cannot be beaten up by a low tier Destroyer.The lower tier person really has to better than you in skills, tactics, etc.You don't have endless shells or torps so, you have to really fire wisely!Therefore, real strategy and real aiming.You control your scout, you guns, aa, torps, etc!! meaning you can really punish yourenemy, not wish for fate for shooting down enemy bombers for example!If you know your range and understand your firing rate, and then you can definitely beat that lower tier, time and time again. No luck but true skill!No unrealistic lower tier beating your great ship. Real Armours, even against torps too!Overcome all odds and still win!3. Different Styles to Choose From.Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer and Submarines, together with LSTs make game play really interesting.At higher tiers, good controls, skillful use of weapons, and good team strategy makes every game more interesting.Good bye to loser games where people just Camp and get a draw!4. And STEAM !!And together with STEAM, like my favorite other vintage strategy game, Age of Empires,I feel this game will run for the long run!!!Good work !What are you waiting for!Battle Stations!!Enjoy real Navy Warfare. Change the destiny of your Fleet!!!BZ !			"

												It is a great game! And it's free so play it!I seen a lot of people's complaints about this game is the tier match up is bad, that t4 or 5 get ""unfairly"" matched against t9 or 10 . This is only half true, people seem to think this game is like world of warship, but it isn't beside both have naval ships. In world of warships you get 12 people max so bascily in that game it come down to people 1v1 or 1v2, 2v2 brawling each other. Since WOWS is all about 1v1 ship action then yes it would be important to not let division match up spread too far. But in this game you get 30 people max in a normal match, each side has 15 players! This game is  more about ""fleet vs fleet"" than ""ship vs ship"" this is the reason why tier match up isn't as important because you would have a few t9 or t10 monster on your side as well. So if you are driving a low tier ship it's really important to stick with your high tier ships, and most importantly kills does NOT reward you more xp or in game currency, the amount of damage you deal does! so as long as you keep doing damage you will get rewarded.Now there are moments where one team get heavily stacked in high tier ships but those cases are rare now days.The biggest down side of this game is it's late tier grind. it's going to take you a LONG time to get high tier ships if you don't get a Premium account  boost, but the developer seem to be giving out free gold ( in game currency bought with real money). so it's not as bad.

												Great game .. like NF1 a little more player friendly . though with a few less features.The game is simple enough to pick up and enjoy straight from the get go. Combat will rely heavily on your skill and this develops with experience. there are  Several different classes of ships which require different tactics and play styles to drive well though ultimately it is a team based game, where players from opposing sides need to be working together to achieve victory. Read a few guides when setting up your officer skills and choosing which lines of ship to play . I myself have 4 bridge officers and 1 of which has ships from each line for a bit of variety . theres alot of negative reviews for this game about pay to win etc etc . they really dont apply ive tried both methods for constructing captains and i can say that the only thing paying money will get you is a little faster progression through the ship tree's. Not paying to achieve the same outcome is alot better to me - just took a few more battles to earn a few more credits and exp . there are No over powered items or weapons that give you significant advantages which is a good thing.. (I miss hedgehogs from nf1 : ( this game is so heavily skill-based that those any advantages can be easily overcome by superior skill. theres nothing like taking out your tier V BB and pawning all comers from I to XI tier and ending a battle on 7+ kills 300+k damage last man standing for a win .. can be done whether you pay or not Great fun, good game			"

												I like the game.  It is a bit arcade-ish but is fun.  I like the variety of ships from the differnet countries.  I wish there were more of the named ships like the Prince Eugine and Neisenau(sp?) from the German faction.  In addition, additional factions would be fun and interesting.  I have played 250+ hours and can say that the higher tier ships are a grind to get to.  This takes alot of the fun out of the game as you wind up just playing missions to get to the next ship and not enjoying the game as one should.			"

												NavyFIELD 2 is to NavyFIELD 1 like Starcraft 2 is to Starcraft. It's not the same, it's probably worse mechanically and it doesn't reward skill and knowledge as much as it's predecessor; but it's newer and more modular. The grind curve grows exponentially when moving up ships, you can go from T1 to T7 in a day, but T8 and T9 may take weeks and T10-T11 may takes months. It's a top-down arcady naval shooter that's one-of-a-kind and very roughly based on real historical WW1 and WW2 ships. The Devs work pretty hard adding new content and fixing bugs but their PR guy needs work. It's a fun game to play on and off and the pay-to-win doesn't really shine through like most freemium games.			"

												Brief: It would be good if it weren't so bad. Be ready for bad people, bad interfaces, and countless bad deaths (at the hands of both teammates and enemies).They say the community is nice and helpful, but apparently ""nice"" means they shoot you for no reason and ""helpful"" means they yell ""noob"" at you and everyone else. The grind is... really wonky. One can get several new ships within a few battles  and apparently nothing really affects one's rewards from battle. So, even if you just get blown up with no idea what you're doing (which I did when I was starting out) you'll still have a full set of ships within minutes... if you can figure out how to get them, as the interface is strange and gives few to no hints about how to use it. Is that an icon or a button? Better check it all! The grind shows up after those few, but is more of what I'd expect from an early game experience for about one tier, then goes immediately into ""Just imagine what that tier 5/tier 6 ship will be like when you get it next week!"" I imagine the T10 users have been playing since before the game was released and just acquired them. Oh, and the ""report a player"" button on their site did nothing until I tried another browser, at which point I got an ""Under Construction"" popup. Their ""Contact GM"" area was apparently locked off because of some email verification thing. I couldn't be bothered... I figure any game attempting to be half-decent will not only have player reporting available but have it easily accessed in-game.Oh, and people don't seem to care to play as any sort of team. Typically several ships will be found faffing about, maybe fully capping some base or just napping in a corner while everyone else dies. Apparently people will actually grind by capping something and then suiciding. I even saw a carrier torpedo bomb itself to do this.			"

And Matchmaking  Let's say one team is full of Tier 1 Destroyers and other is full of tier 5+ Battleships .-. -The moment you realizes you're doomed- other than that it's quite fun infact I started to like it. =)I can't say Thumps up or down I'll give a  up cause I like it but rest you guys decide.

												After playing more than 100 hours in this game i dont recommend it here are reasons why:1. 0 Rewards for being usefull for your team - you dont get more credits or exp for great battles and that leads to super slow progression through tiers. So one can ask how do you earn credits well there is some bonuses to ""normal"" earnings when your ship have reasearched  every single node avaible.2. Upgrades and consumables - there is no such thing as upgrades for few ships at once. Developers aparently thought that every cannon and gun avaible for any ship were designed as completly new construction so despite spending a lot of effort to max out your battleship and after that moving to next tier you cant use previously reseached technologies. (ive double checked that guns with same calliber, barrel lenght and markings cant be transfered to other ships within nation). Consumables are some kind of joke even premium ones - i could understand 1 battle only and then re-buy i could understand higher prices for pernament but buying armor of airplanes for 7 days is just riddiculus. Even if you spend gold (premium currency) for consumables you gonna get it for 7 days .3. Tutorials and in-game information - while movement tutorial is covered rest of tutorials like: how to use planes, how to use sonar etc. are in form of non interactive screen shot (yes 1 screen shot) with MISSING (sic!) information text. Also there is no such thing as shooting range or training mode to find out for yourself when to drop bombs or lunch torpedoes.4. Economy - ive said about battle rewards and let say you can handle it and you are thinking well maybe i should check out other nations i have some credits accumulated i wont need to go through every tier. Nope you wil have to there is no such thing as common  ""bank account"" for all your captains you cant transfer funds between them.5. Controls - just nightmare. Best example is playing carrier: you cant leave your planes unattended they will crash into gound (isnalnds), also you cant just order them to execute attack on given position you will have to manualy drop bombs/torpedoes, you dont even have decent minimap to know where you are needed most or if you are in danger (in game minimap just shows red and blue ship-dots only)6. Balance - Personaly i dont care with what tiers im matched and like in every tier based game you will be matched with higher/lower tiers thats perfectly fine becaues there is always room for outplay but you can be matched with subs without any means of fighting them (only detect them) with ships that was meant to fight them or ships without any AA guns (except ""AI"" controled) fighting air planes. Also you can be matched up to 7 tiers difference but for me its just different game play and i dont really mind it as long i have ANY ability to defend myself.Things like gameplay, graphics, stability etc. are fine. Ques are fast, gameplay is good, graphics have their charm despite bing outdated, didnt encounter many bugs. Conclusion is that game will die as soon as world of warships will be released its unfriendly to new not stubborn players and i do not recommend playing it			"

												Despite allot of negative review of people who played this game for less then 2 hours i think this is a fun game. I played NF1 and NF2 while under NEXON.  I can go on and complain how this game is not like NF1, but hey, this isn't NF1.If you like naval games try this, if you wait for WoWS to be released, try this.  The game if fun. It is fast paced and progression is pretty fast compared to allot of other tiered games. The auto aim function makes the game allot more fair compared to NF1 where seasoned/skilled players had a massive advantage over less good players with manual aim being pretty much the only valuable option.  In NF2 everyone has a chance to be good, without it becomming to simple. Graphics are good enough but not stellar. The game is definetely not what i would call pay to win. Simply becourse only a fool would buy most of the benefitical thing for money. Yes i run premium just to get an even faster progression and support the game. But appart from that the items are rediculously expencive. The game has some irritating bugs, but none gamebreaking. And the game has frequent patches every wednesday. I can wholeheartedly recomend this game. If you even have the least of interest in naval stuff. you should try it. It's free, so why not.  "

												The game is not that bad i like the game play mostly the graphics aren't bad eitherThe only issues i see are the negative player base The false statements made by most state Helpful and friendly player commityAll i have seen on the chat is nothing but typical racism nazism none senseothers who degrade and insult others for no reason.Team damaging and team killing is a major issue as wellAnd you will more likely be in a team that will throw the gameSo that earns from my review a negatve -20I dislike the fact they still allow brazilians into this game as history from the original navy field proved and showed they were the major issue They can't read english and the game is based on english text rules and all and not to mention SD is known too recruit enablers and nazi would be people as moderators who abuse their game powers.I wouldn't suggest anyone in their right minds play this game just for the factyou may end up having such a bad gaming experience due to other minority players ruining itfor others with the team killing and insults too start up a dramatic online fight.Now if SD would kindly just shut out brazil from their games things will be fine cause i havecome across Brazilians who are just more focused on being the center of attentionand whiny.And some other people from other countries who just down right look for any excuse on being meanwith others may very well be the down fall of SDNETUnless they start waking up.. which won't happenAs for the game it selfThe amount of credit and experience cost for ships above tier 5 and 6 are seriouslyhigh too the point you will see yourself grinding it for the long haul.I can understand what they were aiming at... but there are still questionablefactors that'll make others wonder... who..? what..? why?? when??Sorry for the long reading materialAnd the bad grammar english isn't my primary lingoAgain i would not at all suggest this game to any of my pals or anyone at all..I honestly just don't feel brazilians should be allowed too play online games with other nationalities i would sooner play games with russians and canadians and Germans and chinese and japanese sooner than i would play with any brazilian nazi scumbag..

												Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I ♥♥♥♥ing love this game!I recommend it to people who like naval warfare. It's not a pay2win game for the most part. However though the only annoying thing I can find with this game is sacrificing older ships for newer, better ones due to the limited slots. Other than that it's a great game! It has some pretty good graphics and you dont need to spend lots of money to get new ships and vehicles cough* World of Tanks cough*. The research branch works quite well I may add.9.5/10			"

												Navyfield 2 is the Real Navy Game to play for the long run!1. You control your future!!In other words, easy to master controls and you can overturn outcome of a match with your own skills!Not like other naval games where you only have 50% or less chance of winning even if you are a great player!2. Great Balance!You have real balance in that you have real armament!In other words, if you are a Battleship you cannot be beaten up by a low tier Destroyer.The lower tier person really has to better than you in skills, tactics, etc.You don't have endless shells or torps so, you have to really fire wisely!Therefore, real strategy and real aiming.You control your scout, you guns, aa, torps, etc!! meaning you can really punish yourenemy, not wish for fate for shooting down enemy bombers for example!If you know your range and understand your firing rate, and then you can definitely beat that lower tier, time and time again. No luck but true skill!No unrealistic lower tier beating your great ship. Real Armours, even against torps too!Overcome all odds and still win!3. Different Styles to Choose From.Battleship, Carrier, Destroyer and Submarines, together with LSTs make game play really interesting.At higher tiers, good controls, skillful use of weapons, and good team strategy makes every game more interesting.Good bye to loser games where people just Camp and get a draw!4. And STEAM !!And together with STEAM, like my favorite other vintage strategy game, Age of Empires,I feel this game will run for the long run!!!Good work !What are you waiting for!Battle Stations!!Enjoy real Navy Warfare. Change the destiny of your Fleet!!!BZ !			"

												It is a great game! And it's free so play it!I seen a lot of people's complaints about this game is the tier match up is bad, that t4 or 5 get ""unfairly"" matched against t9 or 10 . This is only half true, people seem to think this game is like world of warship, but it isn't beside both have naval ships. In world of warships you get 12 people max so bascily in that game it come down to people 1v1 or 1v2, 2v2 brawling each other. Since WOWS is all about 1v1 ship action then yes it would be important to not let division match up spread too far. But in this game you get 30 people max in a normal match, each side has 15 players! This game is  more about ""fleet vs fleet"" than ""ship vs ship"" this is the reason why tier match up isn't as important because you would have a few t9 or t10 monster on your side as well. So if you are driving a low tier ship it's really important to stick with your high tier ships, and most importantly kills does NOT reward you more xp or in game currency, the amount of damage you deal does! so as long as you keep doing damage you will get rewarded.Now there are moments where one team get heavily stacked in high tier ships but those cases are rare now days.The biggest down side of this game is it's late tier grind. it's going to take you a LONG time to get high tier ships if you don't get a Premium account  boost, but the developer seem to be giving out free gold ( in game currency bought with real money). so it's not as bad.

												I liked this game more then than NF1 except for the upgrades you had in NF1 but they may add them in future updates I think. It reminded me of the ol' days I used to play browsergames like Seafight but than in a WWII style.The game is pretty easy to play if you think logically.There are some high tiers at the beginning that can one shot the starter ship. This should not be a real problem if you understand that when you are small you are also hard to hit. The other way round is this in the favour of the starter. What most beginners forget is that the game is team based so don't sail the ocean on your own or you will be bait for the sharks. I have read a lot of complains about the bad balanced beginning but that is definitely not true. In my first games I already did a lot of damage and sunk some ships already! I would recommend to play the tutorial and read the controls list to learn a bit how the game works. You are not using modern day ships that have missiles instead you have to estimate where to hit the target. This is not difficult and you will learn this fast. I have read complains about planes being impossible to hit. The first time I fired at a plane with AA shells (that you have to use of course) I destroyed it. I noticed that ships without AA shells do auto damage to planes but this is not that effective but good enough to keep them at distance.There are a lot of ships in the game that can be obtained by experience so it takes some effort to get the ship that you want. After de first day I already got a battleship that needs two good shots to destroy a destroyer and is also able to compete against the ""bigger ones"".You can buy large ships for real money but these ships can also be obtained in free to play. This makes it not a ""pay to win"" game but more a ""pay to win faster"" game.Graphics are not that good but in my opinion graphics are not that important in a game. The most important thing is fun and that can be easily get when you blow a fleet with a small destroyer for instance.You must be in the naval subject to play this game otherwise I am afraid that this game is not that fun for you.I am looking forward for World of Warships but I am also looking forward in to future updates of this game because I like naval games like these. I give this game a 9/10 because of the variety of ships and the game-play. -1 for the not that good graphics when you look at NF1 and because the game is not that fun for playing in one session. It is more a game you play until you get bored and log on the next day when you like to blow some battleships again!I played World of Warships and it is.almost the same (not graphically). A bad thing about it is that there are no submarines coming to that game while Navy field has them.And I heard rumours about ships not just from the Navy powers like the USA and Japan but also ships from smaller navies like those from Italy, USSR. and even the Netherlands in the future updates. I don't just recommend playing World of Warships. Play both, World of Warships and Navy field 2!			"

												Brief: It would be good if it weren't so bad. Be ready for bad people, bad interfaces, and countless bad deaths (at the hands of both teammates and enemies).They say the community is nice and helpful, but apparently ""nice"" means they shoot you for no reason and ""helpful"" means they yell ""noob"" at you and everyone else. The grind is... really wonky. One can get several new ships within a few battles  and apparently nothing really affects one's rewards from battle. So, even if you just get blown up with no idea what you're doing (which I did when I was starting out) you'll still have a full set of ships within minutes... if you can figure out how to get them, as the interface is strange and gives few to no hints about how to use it. Is that an icon or a button? Better check it all! The grind shows up after those few, but is more of what I'd expect from an early game experience for about one tier, then goes immediately into ""Just imagine what that tier 5/tier 6 ship will be like when you get it next week!"" I imagine the T10 users have been playing since before the game was released and just acquired them. Oh, and the ""report a player"" button on their site did nothing until I tried another browser, at which point I got an ""Under Construction"" popup. Their ""Contact GM"" area was apparently locked off because of some email verification thing. I couldn't be bothered... I figure any game attempting to be half-decent will not only have player reporting available but have it easily accessed in-game.Oh, and people don't seem to care to play as any sort of team. Typically several ships will be found faffing about, maybe fully capping some base or just napping in a corner while everyone else dies. Apparently people will actually grind by capping something and then suiciding. I even saw a carrier torpedo bomb itself to do this.			"

												Well if your expecting world of tanks on the sea, that is not what you will get. I played long enough to unlock and purchase a few different ships, and play a few battles with each ship, but it just wasn't what I was expecting I guess, because I really couldn't get into it. I was really hoping for a world of tanks type experience with this game, and I love the though of navy warfare.The idea for the game is great, navel warfare like this could be an excellent game, this game just isn't there yet. The controls are kind of clunky and confusing, and there are things lacking from the controls that you should have but do not. The UI is pretty crowded with the chat, and other things around the screen.Despite this I would recommend the game, its not a terrible game, and it has a lot of things going for it. The depth of research for each ship, and the amount of ships you can research is pretty impressive, they do have a lot of options. Their are different aspects of navel warfare that you can take on as well, including aircraft carriers, and deploying infantry onto islands of the maps to take over bases. So again I would recommend it, I guess its just not for me, I was hoping for more.			"

												Despite allot of negative review of people who played this game for less then 2 hours i think this is a fun game. I played NF1 and NF2 while under NEXON.  I can go on and complain how this game is not like NF1, but hey, this isn't NF1.If you like naval games try this, if you wait for WoWS to be released, try this.  The game if fun. It is fast paced and progression is pretty fast compared to allot of other tiered games. The auto aim function makes the game allot more fair compared to NF1 where seasoned/skilled players had a massive advantage over less good players with manual aim being pretty much the only valuable option.  In NF2 everyone has a chance to be good, without it becomming to simple. Graphics are good enough but not stellar. The game is definetely not what i would call pay to win. Simply becourse only a fool would buy most of the benefitical thing for money. Yes i run premium just to get an even faster progression and support the game. But appart from that the items are rediculously expencive. The game has some irritating bugs, but none gamebreaking. And the game has frequent patches every wednesday. I can wholeheartedly recomend this game. If you even have the least of interest in naval stuff. you should try it. It's free, so why not.  "

												Navy Field 2 definitely has its issues, mostly the fact that there is almost no matchmaking system, but that is explained by the fact that there aren't enough people. I personally would rather have large matches with a wide range of ship tiers than a tiny match where everyone was fairly equal. You just have to crash your way up to about tier 7 or 8 and then your on level with all but the really hard core players and the vets of the game. But basically if NF2 was more popular there would be a mm system and there would be no problem but it seems that may never happen.			"

( You'll find out why if you play for long enough)3) I really like the style of game play, its not realistic but more sort of realistic cartoon if that makes sence. (Probilly don't)4) It's easy to start5) I can play APA and kill everyone6) I like the grind, it corts out the good and devoted from the sulk and quit types.7) The gind make aiming for the next teir so much better becouse you know that the next level will be alot better. Worse in the Case of the Royal Navy Hood.Ok that being said, there are a few negitive points that you need t be aware of and i won't just ignore them. 1) Waiting times 2) Occasional Lag3) Crashes (Seem to be fixed in the new update )4) APA killers. Becouse there are some really nasty people who will kill the poor APA rather than that dam Yamato. :P 5) To Few Maps, and the better ones are hard come by. 6) Player numbers. Navy Field is not dead but it could do with some more loyal players (Who arnt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) ^_^Thats it for me. I hope this is simple enough to encorage you to try before you go raging. And if i see you in game i might just send you a shell or two your way. :P In My APA of course.			"

												I must say, i was not overly impressed by the massive faff to log on to a profile i allready use!!!That being said, I really like this game. Most free games these days rely heavely on purchaced content.not this one. I've managed to get to tier 5 quite easly just using the rewards you get from normal gameplay. Before installing i did some research and was led to belive that the community that plays it was hostile to beginnersRacist and generally abusive. I did not find this at all, it is a team game and if you don't learn this FACT early you might not do so well. I've had dude's i've never gamed with rescuing & supporting my efforts. If you don't do dumb things and have a go, the community is generally better than CoH 2 OOps I mean MOST... Most of the crap i've seen is actually from the new players, i feel sorry for you but... if you come on dumb i'm gonna sink you and rake in the rewards. Remember you are part of a FLEET, if you don't loose sight of that you'll be ok.The hardest thing to get you'r head around is the micro, but once you get comfy with the control layout it really is not that hard. the rest is just good old fashoned fun. I personally recommend this game quite highly, for a freebee you really can't go past it. I would have PAID for it, thats how good it is.....P.S. Pls good. kind. merciful dev's, a patch for the logon issues would make it almost perfect...			"

												I would like to love to recommend this and would of if it would have come out when it originally was supposed to, having now played World of Warships I can't recommend this at all.  WoWarships has better graphics, better controls in my opinion, and better strategic gameplay. Only advantage Navyfield 2 has is a slightly more expanded shiptrees but I have greater expectation that wargaming will add more. So if you have to pick a Free to play arcade style WWII ship game I would pick World of Warships everytime over Navyfield 2			"

												Brief: It would be good if it weren't so bad. Be ready for bad people, bad interfaces, and countless bad deaths (at the hands of both teammates and enemies).They say the community is nice and helpful, but apparently ""nice"" means they shoot you for no reason and ""helpful"" means they yell ""noob"" at you and everyone else. The grind is... really wonky. One can get several new ships within a few battles  and apparently nothing really affects one's rewards from battle. So, even if you just get blown up with no idea what you're doing (which I did when I was starting out) you'll still have a full set of ships within minutes... if you can figure out how to get them, as the interface is strange and gives few to no hints about how to use it. Is that an icon or a button? Better check it all! The grind shows up after those few, but is more of what I'd expect from an early game experience for about one tier, then goes immediately into ""Just imagine what that tier 5/tier 6 ship will be like when you get it next week!"" I imagine the T10 users have been playing since before the game was released and just acquired them. Oh, and the ""report a player"" button on their site did nothing until I tried another browser, at which point I got an ""Under Construction"" popup. Their ""Contact GM"" area was apparently locked off because of some email verification thing. I couldn't be bothered... I figure any game attempting to be half-decent will not only have player reporting available but have it easily accessed in-game.Oh, and people don't seem to care to play as any sort of team. Typically several ships will be found faffing about, maybe fully capping some base or just napping in a corner while everyone else dies. Apparently people will actually grind by capping something and then suiciding. I even saw a carrier torpedo bomb itself to do this.			"

												Navy Field 2. This game is a serious mix of both strong and very poor development choices. For example, this games ship class system works fairly effectivly, and includes a greater range of ship types than other games. On the other hand, there is almost no form of match making, meaning that bottom and top tier ships end up in the same matches. While the controls are very effective and well thought out, theres no tutorials for features that desperately need them. One consistantly occuring issue I have found is that the game lacks new content. The audio track is very limited, and repeates constantily. There is also a lack of effort to upgrade this game with new features.Summary:Pros:+ Plenty of ship classes, including submarines.+ Large maps.+ Strong controls.+ Large exclusion of premium content prevents new players from buying there way to top tier.Cons:- Lack of new content.- No real match making system.- Repetive sound track.- Inconsistant match search times, ranging from 2 seconds, too 200 seconds.- Largly one upped by world of warships in almost every way.- Desperate need for effective tutorial.Conclusions:This game never really seamed to get of the ground in the first place. Not long after its release, world of warships beta was released and once the finished game was out, navy field 2 was all but finished. So while this game certainly isnt bad, it is also a long ways from being good. The real nail in the coffin is the lack of community. So all in all, this game is definetly starting to see the end of its days.6.5/10			"

												I did love this game but after last night i just cant any more.  I like to play subs and rightfully so they are hard to level up, they also do a ton of damage so they really are fun.  But, when a ship can teleport and completely break the game for no reason it just becomes frustrating and unenjoyable.  i dont think i will be playing NF2 any more unless they remove teleport.			"

												I Love this game... Jst put that put there.Why i like this game. 1) the community hate me. ( You'll find out why if you play for long enough)2) The community Love. ( You'll find out why if you play for long enough)3) I really like the style of game play, its not realistic but more sort of realistic cartoon if that makes sence. (Probilly don't)4) It's easy to start5) I can play APA and kill everyone6) I like the grind, it corts out the good and devoted from the sulk and quit types.7) The gind make aiming for the next teir so much better becouse you know that the next level will be alot better. Worse in the Case of the Royal Navy Hood.Ok that being said, there are a few negitive points that you need t be aware of and i won't just ignore them. 1) Waiting times 2) Occasional Lag3) Crashes (Seem to be fixed in the new update )4) APA killers. Becouse there are some really nasty people who will kill the poor APA rather than that dam Yamato. :P 5) To Few Maps, and the better ones are hard come by. 6) Player numbers. Navy Field is not dead but it could do with some more loyal players (Who arnt♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) ^_^Thats it for me. I hope this is simple enough to encorage you to try before you go raging. And if i see you in game i might just send you a shell or two your way. :P In My APA of course.			"

												Love the game, played the original navy field when i was around 8 years old. However, due to the frequent crashes of the game being run through steam (far less problems using stand alone client) and the tiny, dieing fanbase caused by the developers lack of passion and motivation to make the game better, it is almost not worth installing. But if you are willing to give the game a try we are a welcoming community and would love to see new faces			"
