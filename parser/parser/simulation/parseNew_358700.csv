												Driving is a cool feature, but the building aspect is a trainwreck.			"

												Badly produced game. Don't bother buying. The controls are all over the place, the camera and building systems are awful and it is hard to follow some of the tutorials.			"

												i love to work with the given modular structures, but basically it is building steelbeam by steelbeam and it takes some time.You also need some time to get into it. In exchange you get a bridge that is really yours. A bridge that could probably stand in reality as well. Other bridge builders compared to this are more like making a sketch of a bridge and some invisible engineers do the rest of the work. Here it is more of the real task of basic building.			"

												It's not most beautiful bridge building game, still needs a lot of polishing, but 3d Bridges is definitely most complexed one I played. Pro's:+ Complexity+ Total freedom in making working bridge+ Various buildable machines and objects+ DrivingCon's:- Camera control - Graphic & menu optionsOverall;If you love challenging building bridge games, and at same time don't mind outdated graphic then I can recommend you this game, in any other case wait for more updates or grab it on big discount.

												This game is definitely more complicated than most bridge building games but if you like to build bridges theres nothing better :D The camera is kinda hard to control but overall its a great bridge building game.Make the camera esier to navigate and I give this game 10/10 for bridge building.

												This is a very complex and fun simulation of bridge building. It provides you with a variety of tools which allows you to build good bridges. The graphics are not next-gen but this still doesn't affect the gameplay, after all it is mostly about the physics which is done very well. Pros: - Good physics engine; needed for a game like this. - The vehicle is easy to drive, and provides an interior and exterior view. - The tutorials are detailed and teach about the game easily.Cons: - The camera can sometimes be awkward, but easily can get used to it. - The graphics can be improved, but again, that is not the point of the game.Overall, I feel this is a very good game. There are regular updates, keeping the game fun and playable. Would recommend.			"

												Holy crud batman! The UI is horrible!I swear you have to have brain damage in order to use it.Come on, shouldn't the UI be pretty streight forward?Having a bad UI is like a car with no steering wheel, or brakes, or gas peddle. Sigh... "

												Top notch game.Top of the class for realistic physics.Top of the class for replay value- The levels never get old!Only real criticism I have with the game are the graphics, however it is obvious that this is not the focus of the game.8/10- Wish new levels would be added!			"

												What a great concept!The graphics are pretty minimalist, but it is not a game where it comes to the latest graphics.The physics is complete and works reliably, the possibility to switch to the stress indicator is particularly useful if you want to improve your design.The editor for the construction work is well thought out, you can completely concentrate on designing.What bothers me personally a bit is the height grid, there could be a few lines less on it but you soon get used to it.The tutorial is very detailed like the tooltips. The player has to learn how to operate, but more help you can't expect.It also seems to get updated on a regular basis, which means that the developer(s) still actively working on it.Overall, I find the implementation of a Bridge game well done, other than the usual sandbox games where you only have colored cubes available.I'll probably spend a couple of hours, mainly because it gets quite tricky in the advanced levels.

												You probbaly want to give this a miss.This doesn't even look like the screenshots let alone play like advertised. The graphics are abysmal, the interface is awful. This game just made my eyes bleed and and my brain go on holidays.There are other bridge building games. They're fun, they look good and they function well. Go play one of those.I had to go back and play this game for another full minute just so I could warn you all!Honestly, I gave it a go, and kudos to the devloper for getting something published. Hell I haven't achieved that, so well done!But as a gamer, as a lover of games where you build stuff... this isnt the game to play.			"
