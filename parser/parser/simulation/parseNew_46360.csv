												After playing through non-steam versions of Theatre of War 2 (Africa, Kursk, Battle for Caen) and Theatre of War 3: Korea I purchased the steam versions as well (during sale).IMHO, this is not just another WW2 tactical game, it is the MOST REALISTIC simulator of company-level battles of 1943-1951 warfare!Not easy to master for everyone who is used to ""select'em all -> send'em all!"" tactics! Every shell and armor interaction follows real physics laws, every unit moves are done in the real scale (time and distances), all  battles are very intense and make you feel that this is how it was for real!Every wargamer eager for WW2 realism must try at least!

												Overall, ToW games shine in armor combat. Each crew member is individually modeled and they depend on each other. Each projectile is calculated individually, including it's path after penetrating the armor.  Secondary fragmentation, shell stability, interior equipment damage, this kind of things (and in Kursk and later games you can turn on hit vectors display mode that visually shows you detailed info - hit angles, caliber, penetrations...).Moreover, starting from Africa ALL vehicles have historically correct view ports, so if a MG gunner is killed noone will be using his view slits and tank will become blind from the right side. This is not all. A crew member can use only one view point at a time, so if a commander is busy assigning targets appearing from the front to a gunner, he may not notice targets from behind (and noone else in the tank can watch behind).Well, you get the idea:)			"

												A good game with really good and clear effort and love behind it, BUT there is one glaring, game breaking problem, and that is the extreme frame rate drop nearly half way through any mission. At times it can drop to about 5 frames a second. It has nothing to do with machine as I run far more demanding games, but rather the poor coding. Sadly, I cannot recommend this game, but if the concept interests you try out Graviteam Tactics Operation Star. With the uniform mod, that game is not only gorgeous and historically accurate to the T graphics wise, but also the best strategy game on the market.			"

												POWERED BY: POTATO ENGINE 2™Jokes apart, this is why steam should have ""maybe"" as an option. To enjoy this game, you need to be quite the hardcore history fan. ESPECIALLY if you come from more modern and famous RTS games such as CoH or wargame, this game will feel endlessly clunky and irresponsive.However, as it comes to tactical simulation, this easily is the most realistic game i have ever withnessed. As an ex commander myself, i was really surprised as it feels really similar to comanding real men.THEIR BEST FEATURE:auto movement. Yes you heard right. The AI units on your command in this game have the unique ability of making small moves theirselves, wich is uinmatched to any other rts game i played so far. THIS IS WHY ALSO A LOT OF NOOBS ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT ""units doing what they want to"". You can disable auto movement.Don't blame the players, this game probably has the most unintuitive UI around, wich is defenetively fatal as it will end up in♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off even the most patient of players: Even after many playtroughs i still dont know how to use half of the ui, believe it or not.SMALL BUT IMPORTANT FACTS:1)This is 1943 only. Indeed, all units ore from that time period. They did the dumb thing to add in the ability to set battles in 1944 and 1945, adding in the tiger and the is2 WITHOUT CHANGING ANYTHGING ELSE. Why should i have a tiger B from 1944 altogheter with a panther D from 1943?2)RNG. A lot of it. Lovely especially if you are into realism.3)You cant repair anything in game. Nothing. IF your tiger B you spent half of your points on gets stuck in the mud, it is over. Again, for hardcore realism fans, it will make you feel like you are the kampfgruppefuhrer.4) NO SUPPLY SYSTEM! WHY! This is important with infantry: you get a man with 15 bullets and you cannost supply him! Like what!5) As for the potato engine joke, this game is memory heavy and wont go over 40 fps on the strongest machines. :(""So you seem to enjoy the game, why you do not reccomend it?"" you will say.Well, unless you are a hardcore realism fan and you can take a clunky and  irresponsive laggy game for the glory of realism, You will never enjoy this.If you really feel like it, add me and i can help anyone a lot trough the torture of understanding the UI,and maybe we could have a couple of matches.

												Not what i had expected. Clunky controls, unresponsive units. Game is quite tedious.I can usually get past that, i don't mind slow and hard-to-learn strategy games. But it's just not responsive nor is it any fun, and frankly, i find the tactical value to be lackluster due to unavailible options for unit behaviour. (infantry only hit the dirt when under fire instead of ordering them to do so before they are under fire, for example) your units also act clunky and units are unresponsive, especially for tank and gun crews, which is my biggest issue. I am well aware that the game creates a somewhat realistic factor by having a delay in orders and units acting sort-of by themselves, but often at times it seems like my soldiers have a death-wish by simply deciding to hit the dirt right in the middle of a killzone, or tanks refusing to turn the right direction when under fire.There are also a number of more 'hidden' factors in the game, such as morale, but i couldn't find it. Armor and penetration values for guns and ammo also only displayed the moment when i really started searching for them. While ammo penetration and armor resilience are displayed, they are only done so pre-game when assembling forces and in the encyclopedia. If you happen to stumble upon a tank in-game, you're just gonna have to guess or know these statistics beforehand - which is just silly.The tutorial is practically nonexistant and explains nothing. While that's usually not too much of an issue for me (i dont mind googling, watching YT vids to get my information) it is still frustrating nonetheless.I do applaud the creators for trying, the genre is kind of a niche and i really enjoy the setting and the armchair-general genre as a whole, but Theatre of War is just one big dissapointment. I recommend avoiding it.I recommend picking up Men of War: Assault Squad instead. Not only is it more accessible, it's also got far more depth than Theatre of War, along with excellent sound effects, better graphics, immersion, and an active modding/multiplayer community. And most importantly: Unit behaviour and responsiveness works - unlike Theatre of War.			"

												What you get for your money this game should be at least 90%,it's not as good as graviteam Mius front(because it's older,yet Devs STILL support this:)) but it's equal too the MoW series,except they leave out the micro management.There are really cool mods that add a nice flavor to the game too and you can find some excellent Pz lehr skins and others,and at this price you cant find better imho,i have most wargames worth buying on steam and i highly reccomend this,the low price always puts people off,don't let it put you off!.

												I like this game. It's incredibly detailed and gameplay is good, but it's very buggy and the AI is unreliable. Too often units won't follow orders or hit an insignificant obstacle and cease movement. I also had a performance issue on an older pc where after closing the game CPU usage remains high until restarting. I enjoyed the game and it might be worth buying on sale			"

												Maybe not that good as Combat Mission but good enough to enjoy the details of realistic combat mechanisms. Its not a casual mainstream RTS though, - if you're not patient and try to overrun everyone with everything you got, then you'll rather stick with Command and Conquer. However, they are some buggy issues, which should have been fixed.			"

												for a 5 year old game it looks very good, graphics and animations are all very well done, the UI is intuitive  and the front end (menus and options etc) is very slick.So it's a shame that the gameplay is so dire, it's boring, lifeless and flat.If you like this type of game take a look at 'Graviteam Tactics Operation Star' for an example of why gameplay matters and it looks at least as good as this, if not better, although be warned - steep learning curve alert ; )			"

												As a sequel I simply can't recommend this game. It seems to take several steps back, and in doing so hits it's head against an open cupboard.Firstly, there's the issue of why Theatre of War 2 comes in 2 games, each with their own add-ons? The answer to which illudes me completely. The original game had way more content, more nations, and a wider time period. Poland and France have been removed, and Italy and the USA needlessly funnelled off into their own game (which is also suffers from a severe lack of content). The British only have equipment they had at Caen, and not even all of that is present (have you ever heard of the RAF, 1C?). Are we to believe the feed back for the first game was ""there's too much stuff, I want less choice""? Obviously it wasn't, so this is another quandery with no real reasoning.Secondly, there's a grand total of one new mechanic. It's not even pluralisable. Just the one thing that's been added. It's not a terrible one, just poorly executed. The new mechanic is points. You spend points on the task force which you take on missions, and you get points for destroying enemy units. This in and of itself works fine, although knowing what's worth what would be quite nice, as you've no way of knowing in the middle of a battle (or in the menus for that matter). The only real downside is that your support now costs points. So you need at least 3000 points before you can call in artillery. Given that the average tank kill gets you about 400~ points, you need to wipe out roughly an entire battalion of tanks before High Command decide the situation looks a little hairy, and grant you off-map arty support. I'm not sure why this change was made, as artillery and air support were finite resources anyway, so you could quite easily blow it all on a not-so-serious attack and only realise later there's still another 300 dudes to kill, and your 6 remaining shells probably won't do the trick.These are just the starkest of the games faults. There's so many little things going wrong as well, from unforgivably bad sound design (Brits speaking in American voices and the generally empty feel of the soundtrackless battles (the music slider is actually greyed out but left in)), all the way to awkward, but sadly compulsary, infantry micro-management (I shouldn't have to manually give my MG ammo while I want to be flanking a Tiger with my SU-85). It's just so frustrating to have a beautifully rendered WW2 battlefield, and then feel consricted and fustrated by mechanics of the game.Wait, why am I spending 3 paragraphs moaning about a 4 year old game nobody even plays? Perhaps I'm passionate about the subject? Or just unemployed?It's the second one. Hey 1C, give me a gig as a play tester you f**king hacks!			"

												DO NOT BUY THIS COMPANIES PRODUCTS   it is clear 1C company cleary does not understand how to program or design a video.The theatre of war games look assume and when it is right they a dam good, but due to lack of skill on the developers part a great game becomes a pile of crap.User interface.  For some strangE reason the developers decided not to tell the player what to do. I am not talking about holding the players hands jsut simply saying what the mission is. You start the battle and given this order, you complete said order adn continue fighting until the game decides it had enough  The missions are so scripted that the only way to end some are by having a unit int he right spot. Funny part is the developers never tell you what unit or what spot. Guess they decided to through in some fun mini game    There may be no AI in the game.         AI controlled allies will not fight sometimes simply park in the back and wait till you are killed      Pathfinding is not there, units move in a stright line until the hit something then turn slightly and repeat til they get to thier position  This game sucks, there is simply no better why to say it    This could have been a great game, maybe battlefront will pass it own to people who know what they are doing			"
