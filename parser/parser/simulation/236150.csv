Early Access Review
								First Impressions:For an early access game this game is already really playable as the sandbox mode works just fine. See this game as EVE offline. You fly your own ship (which you can upgrade or just buy a bigger one) around a HUGE universe that has highway like wormholes and natural wormholes. You can also move around anywhere under your own power so just traveling on highways or through wormholes isn't a must. There are hints of fleets in thwere but haven't been able to start one, although you can already by extra ships and leave them in your garage.Your Ship:Upgrades for your ships are plenty and the weapon systems include, lasers, plasma cannons, railguns, missiles, and much more which you can freely add to any supporting hardpoint on your ship (light for guns, heavy for ammo consuming launchers). All upgrades and repairs happen on the station and I've noticed you really need to shop around the stations to get the best stuff.Your Crew:Yes, this game has crews as even your starting ship is more then the usual fighters you get in other games. There are 3 shipstations which you can hire crew for. The crew gives you boosts on weapons or ship systems like engines, shields and cloaks depending on their skills. Again every station/planet offers different crews with different skills.Gameplay:Random missions are generated all the time wich includes simple ""go there and shoot.."" missions, scan anomalies and bringing around cargo and passengers. You can visit many many stations (and planets) to upgrade, repair, hire crew, trade and lots more. The universe is very much alive as you encounter friendly and non friendly ships all over the place. Some sectors and stations really don't like you and can form a real challange when fighting in those sectors (enemy reinforcemants and stations blasting you). Fighting is mouse controlled, aim and shoot your light weapons by clicking the right mouse button and fire your heavy ammo consuming weapons with X. Also you can give the command ""Fire at will"" which will basically unleash all weapons on all in range enemies (this can be very much fun to watch while you just fly around avoiding damage with guns blazing).Trade is already present in the game but is still in it's first stages so you get very little info on prices except for a news scroller that is viewable on every planet and station.Development:Patches are rolling out in a steady pace and the devs are very active on the forums (Post a question, suggestion or comment and you'll likely get a reply within the hour). This just gives you extra confidence to buy this game in early access and help in it's development.Current Verdict July 18 2014:Highly recommended early access game that is only getting better with each update.*My above opinion still hasen't changed, latest update is again full of content. Recommend to pick up on current sale :)Current Verdict September 16 2014:Latest patches have added full controller support for fans of those things. Also the game is nearly complete as release is almost here, they've been busy with optimizing the game and adding final features, complete campaign/story mode is not finished yet but devs have indicated it's coming soon! (And in the past they've proven time and time again that they uphold their word!).So still a big fat recommend from me at this final stage of early access.			"

												This was the game I wanted when I wanted to be a space captain/pirate.  There are ships.  The ships come in different sizes and configurations.  You start in a tin can with a couple of turrets and work your way up to space battleships.  Some of them can be challenging to get your hands on, if a faction you've ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off is the only one that makes it.  There are different weapon systems, each with strengths and weaknesses.  There can be a story/plot if you want it to be the driving reason behind your space-captaining/piracy.  The game punishes you for thinking you are a main character with plot armor and can charge at whatever your quest is without strategy.  It rewards you for doing a bit of grinding on the side for money and xp, be that with asteroid mining, quasi-legal trading, playing space police, or space piracy.Being a space game, there are a lot of different controls and interface options.  There are less than other space games I've tried.  Navigation is relatively simple, and wormholes, ion storms and radiation clouds make that more interesting than the vastness of space probably is.  You need captain 'levels' to fly bigger ships, but xp can be earned from basically doing anything.  Aiming is done via turrets.  Pick a view mode you like, aim the turrets yourself or let the computer do it for you, find a ship you like, and fly around space.  That's what you're here for right?It took me 40 to 50 hours to finish each story line, taking my time and taking advantage of the vast numbers of pirates just waiting to be boarded and salvaged.  Ultimately this was the first 3d space game I've tried that gave me some complexity while still making 'fly a ship through space' enjoyably easy.  I enjoy leveling, working my way up from the bottom and becoming an unstoppable juggernaut.  I enjoy flying a ship through space and shooting things with lasers, or guns, or plasma cannons.  I enjoy some odd challenges and impossible odds.  I enjoy exploring.  I felt accomplished when I finished the plot in my decked out dreadnought.  I enjoyed this game.  And the free DLC.Spaaaaaaaaace.  What's your favorite thing about space? (mine's space)			"

												TL;DR: At the verrry bottom, ya heathens!This game, wow. It is eating away at my soul here. Like I need to sacrifice another small vessel for creds so I can sleep again.I bought this game cause I had a gut feeling it was what I needed in a game right now. Yeah sure there are others like it, but I just wanted singleplayer and something really solid and fun. An man was I in for a treat! I had no idea I could enjoy a game so much again, like back in the day with all the old systems around and gramps was trying to figure out why the TV is calling him. So far the story has been very engaging with some smug and unsavory characters, not to mention a bunch of stuff to do on the way. Clearing asteroid fields for some spare loot to fill that cargo hold, capturing enemy ships to either sell or dock for your own collection. Beaming aboard your crew to steal stuff for you on a old mining field or enemy ship in battle to turn the tide an steal it for yourself, you will have to tractor beam it the whole way at impulse speeds to the nearest planet or station of course, who wants to do anything the easy way any way? Psssh.You have your classic worm holes you can use to travel or them good ole relays for cash, but who wants to waste money?Also you will run into random slipstreams in which you can use to traverse.. well the verse, by steering your ship properly through it. Be warned about worm holes though you can loose people, but don't worry you can get more red shirts at the nearest docking bay :D.Even combat is savvy. Tell your people to fire at will, take the helm do it yourself or root all power to engines as the words of Firefly's Jane ""Let's Moon'm"" cascades from your lips like lavander and oats. Be a commander, be THE commander. Hire merc ships to roll in your space posse, have a fleet of some bad to the bone misunderstood ship captains looking for redemption and love among the stars. You can of course also customize your ships colors and a few decals, but the real bread n' butter is the all the parts you can fit the ships with. An there is a lot of parts ranging from pulsar cannons to rail guns.You are not constrained in anyway wanna be that scruffy looking nerf herder? You can! Got that Serenity Smuggling Fever? This game has the cure my friend! Wanna travel across space corralling convicts like Cowboy Bebop? See you space cowboy, I'll be chilling with Jet. Wanna make enemies of a gang Outlaw Star Style? Look no further time to pop that space cherry Gene Starwind! Need to feel like you're back in Star Fleet Academy with Kirk? Picard? Riker? Janeway? Tuvok? Classes start as soon as you hit the buy button cadet! An tell Neelix I sent ya ;D.What is also great is that the devs have been very responsive and helpful working with the community to solve issues, active devs have really made this product shine and continues to better. I do hope you get the game and enjoy as much as I am.In my conclusion yes I recommend this amazing game, I have spent the last few years just really yearning for something, but sure what exactly. When I saw this I knew my sacrifice to the Game Satan had finally been heard. The graphics are solid and just breathtaking, the gameplay is as smooth as Bruce Willis's bald spot in The 5th Element. An steam workshop also? All I can say is beam me up Scotty, we can do it Captain this time we have the power.TL;DR: Game good. Combat fun. RPG Loot Funsies. Space much of. Do lots o' stuff. Very shiny graphs. Much impressed. You should buy it too.			"

Early Access Review
								So, you've played Freelancer, Wing Commander or Privateer. Its been years since these games were released and perhaps, for you, just like me, they left behind a massive void. I've leapt at EVERY space sim/rpg that been released in the hopes, that one day, they'll replace what I lost with Freelancer. Sadly they never did. So I saw this on the front page of Steam and thought, heres another disapointment. Well Starpoint Gemini 2...blew me away. This game is THE best space sim I've ever played and its in beta!! Beta will always be beta, that said, this game is solid. When you read the description and see theres only a dozen planets, don't be fooled. The galaxy is ♥♥♥♥ing huge. Absolutely enormous. Open world to boot. No loading screens. Just you, your ship and the stars. There are some absolutely amazing locations, zipping through asteroids, cruising the nebulas...its awesome. Theres a diverse choice of ships for you to cruise the stars with. Gunships, Corvettes, Frigates, Destroyers, Cruisers, Battleships, Dreadnaughts, Carriers, Freighters and freightliners. Each ship category has multiple choices and each of those choices allows you to build your ship in the fashion you want. Do you want a ship decked with heavy batteries, rain missiles and torpedos down on people. Do you want a majority of light batterries, decking your ship with railguns, beams or plasma cannons? Perhaps a ship that can deploy a large number of soldiers to board the enemy ship and take it over. Yea, you read that right. You can board an enemy ship, take it over and either destroy, loot it or sell it.Perhaps the trade life is for you, with a vast hold and fast engines to shoot you away from the pesky gunships. Trade hasn't been completely implemented atm. In Freelancer if you remember, you could see what planets were buying what for what price etc etc. That hasn't been implemented yet so you have to find them yourself. Perhaps your a miner at heart and want to reap the profits from those floating rocks. Go right ahead, blast away. If you want a huge yield you can buy missiles especially dedicated to obtaining larger yields. You can tailor your ship to fulfil what ever role you require. If you need more energy to fire you weapons, buy system attachments and upgrades to improve their energy reserves and recharge rates. Missing that little gunship too much, you can increase their accuracy or their damage against their shields. You can hack the enermy ship and disable their systems if thats the approach you like. You choose a career role. Each role has various abiliies for use that augment your fleet, turrets, shields, movement and various other cool things. Yea, thats right. You can build your own fleet to travel around the galaxy with you. Sounds perfect for a bounty hunter right? Your going to need it to tackle the toughest bounties in the galaxy. You track the bounties yourself and take them down. Be warned though, they aren't alone and they're prepared to fight. Seriously guys, I can't praise this game enough for what its doing. Yea, theres only free roam available atm but you can do WHAT EVER you want. Want to be a pirate, theres a huge array of choices for you and they're everywhere. You want to own your own carrier and deploy fighter wings, YOU ♥♥♥♥ING CAN!!! THIS GAME IS IN BETA and despite that, you can do soo damn much. I've crashed twice and that was in the first 2 hrs, since then, I haven't had a single problem. The galaxy is yours for that taking atm. I highly reccomend this game to all Freelancer, Privateer and Wing Commander fanatics. Even to those who are new to the scene. This game is so diverse and intricate in all its details...but god damn its so easy and simple to understand and master.This game is in on-going development, if its this good already, I can't wait till its finished!!

												====================================== Starpoint Gemini 2	(Updated review!)======================================**Don't Forget to Nominate this Game for the Steam Awards!**LGM Games’ successful debut title, Starpoint Gemini, an RPG tactical sim set in a unique SciFi setting was released in 2010. It was a great learning experience for them and it paved the way for their next game - Starpoint Gemini 2, the sequel. It entered Steam Early Access program in September 2013, and a year later after what most would consider one of the best Early Access communities on Steam, Starpoint Gemini 2 hit the shelves on Steam in Sep 26, 2014.On a personal note, I was honored to have been with such an amazing community. Both players and the Developers worked together so well that I myself strongly believe it was the best early access game on Steam! I made many friends and I truly enjoyed the journey...====================================== Pros	+Huge dynamic game world that can be explored as a whole!+Can play the story campaign or go free roam sandbox style.+Workshop with plenty of cool mods.+A ton of ships to fly and tweak!+Combat in big ships with fleets...+Did I say Mining? Yep, you can mine asteroids...+Very well done Faction system+You can Trade with a good amount of commodities+Developer support that sets a new standard+Best Community on Steam+Awesome Replay value!+Free content updatesConsNone really. Yea, the game is THAT good :-)Neutral+/- Average voice-overs (This is a good thing to me)======================================IntroductionStarpoint Gemini 2 is an action space-sim combined with diverse RPG elements. Control various space ships, ranging from small and agile gunships to lumbering, but deadly carriers. Explore, trade, mine asteroids, and research in a star system no longer hindered by loading points. The entire Gemini star system is now one giant area thanks to the implemented streaming technology. Gain experience and upgrade your skills to change the tide of even the fiercest space battles. Complex, but easy-to-use RPG system with skills and perks to customize as you see fit. This also gives great replay value, you can literally spend many many hours just trying different styles...======================================Game-playI have played EVE online, Elite Dangerous, and lots of other games in the space genre. Out of every space game in my Steam library, this is the one that keeps me coming back for more. Deep, immersive, beautiful. It is the perfect open space sandbox game. To elaborate, yes there is a story campaign mode that will guide you through the lore of the game. It does this via story-missions, in-fact at the start of a new game you can choose to play campaign or free roam(sandbox). A great feature is that even in the campaign you can do the story missions at your own pace. There is a great many of freelance and side missions.I played the first Starpoint Gemini so I was going into this quite excited, but you don’t have to play the original in order to enjoy this sequel anyway(They made the first one playable with the free DLC Starpoint Gemini 2: Origins). It is a space game all about exploring, mining asteroids, trading, capturing, and flying multiple ships and getting lost in a massive dynamic universe. It is the kind of space game I love to get lost in for long periods of time just roaming through space and immersing myself into the game world. This game certainly provides many ways to do it, such as gearing up a ship to go on a mining run. There is so much to do in this game it can get overwhelming at times. (But in a good way)When you first launch the game, you will be introduced with tutorial tip screens. These can, of course, be ignored, but I would strongly advise that you read everyone of them. The interface can be quite complex and there is many ways you can customize the ships so no need to go in blind by turning off the Tips!. You want to survive for more than ten minutes in space for your first captain. There is another matter I would like to clear up as well, this game is not EVE Online or Elite: Dangerous. It is a unique tactical space sim with exploration and missions. Many people including the Dev's would say that it is more comparable to Freelancer in all the good ways...Mastering the ship controls is not that easy at first, because there are a number of ways to view the action. There is the turret view which allows you to swing around the ship so you can track everything around your vessel, the mounted view which puts you just above the ship, and a third person view which puts you just behind the ship. All of them have their own advantages depending on the situation you may be in and half the battle is understanding when to use which view. It takes practice to master this when the combat gets hectic and you need to start switching rapidly between them. As ships have location based shields, being aware of what is attacking (and from where) can be the difference between life and death.This game really shines at immersing you into the life of a deep space merchant, miner, pirate, or whatever you prefer! There are so many options and the awesome guys at LGM have done a great job at making every path fun and viable. There is a ton of customization to help you really fill the role you choose as well. I personally spent several hours just looking at my options the first time I leveled up. Any hardcore RPG fan will have a ton of fun just building and tweaking their character and ship into their very own ultimate space hero... Or a feared pirate. So just let your imagination run wild.I mentioned customization earlier and this game has a ton of it. You can hire staff for your ship which affects its performance: For example, you might hire a crew member who increases your propulsion speeds. You have complete control over your equipment load-out and their enhancements. You can even customize the look of your ship to some degree. All of this is generally handled when you anchor yourself to a space station or planet. While docked, in addition you can buy and sell trade goods, read news clips, access a garage which houses your ships, and more. It sounds like a lot to deal with, but between all the tutorials, which are accessible at any time for reference, and the well-designed interface, you’ll have your hands around it in a reasonable amount of time.============================================================================ConclusionStarpoint Gemini 2 is a game for space lovers made by space lovers. This is by far one of the best open space games I played and it will delight you with its gorgeous visuals. There is a true sense of adventure as you discover new areas of the star chart, with opportunity and danger lurking around every corner so you are constantly encouraged to build yourself up in terms of power, wealth, and relationships with the various factions.LGM and its great team have created an instant classic that will be around for many years....======================================			"

 SHORT SUMMARY:  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a bit shallow and a bit pricey for what it offers, but it is still enjoyable. Overall the story was okay enough to keep me going, and the combat was fun enough to make my stay in Gemini enjoyable. If you are itching for a space sim that is pretty easy to get into and doesn't require a large time commitment to win (around 24 in-game hours for me), this will scratch that itch pretty well. Otherwise, you may want to think carefully on buying this game unless it's on sale.However, the developers appear to be actively working on improvements to the game as time goes on. Some concerns raised in this article may be addressed as time goes on. Keep an eye on the updates page if you're interested in this product!---------- LONGER REVIEW:  The good: Visuals are nice, music is nice, starship aesthetics are good too, and the combat is solid. The universe feels big, and provides a pretty immersive experience of traveling through space. Said universe is also populated by various starships as well, usually around space stations and various other miscellaneous space structures. There are many different factions that like to use certain types of ships and lay claim to different areas of space, and you can easily see heated space battles taking place at faction borders. The HUD takes a little getting used to, but is pretty nice once you learn it. The game itself is a bit grindy as it uses RPG levelling mechanics to determine what ship you can pilot, but I personally didn't mind it that much since the combat was pretty fun. The not-so-good: The story is okay. The Voice Acting for the story dialogue ranges from terrible to okay. Side-story missions boil down to ""repair structure there for $$$ and XP"" or ""kill enemies here for $$$ and XP"" or ""ferry person over there for $$$ and XP"" with little fanfare. After you finish the main story, all you can do are the missions described earlier.  During the main story, certain factions and places will be purportedly destroyed or crippled, but what this actually means is that you will just pretend that the story happened while in practice the universe remains largely intact and unchanged. Certain mechanics are a bit shallow (i.e. hiring crew = looking up which dude/gal has which bonuses, click hire button). Also, while you *can* be a merchant or asteroid miner in this game, it seems to be much eaiser just to capture enemy ships and tow them back to a planet/station where you can sell them.Character progression is RPG-like, yet character skills/perks can pretty much be ignored. Your character's power is MUCH more dependent on what type of ship you are piloting and how well it is outfitted. The RPG mechanics are more akin to a gating system, where your level determines the type of ship you can pilot. For me, the entire game was a bit grindy. This was how it went down: capture/sell ships until I can afford the next weight class of ship, do missions (sometimes main storyline) so I can meet the level requirement of said ship. Repeat until I have achieved highest class of ship. ------ Long segment about what I would have liked to have seen in the game:  Multiple plotlines in the game.  The ""Escape Velocity"" series of games (plot-heavy 2D shooter space-sim) implemented this rather well; there were multiple plotlines for each main faction AND there were also a lot of side plotlines too.Examples of side-plots: testing prototype weapons for a starship arms company, or ferrying vacationing CEOs to a jungle planet for big game hunting, or helping a rockstar go on tour throughout the galaxy only to discover that he's a robot! Or picking up a random stranger and ferrying him to a planet only to discover that he's a leader of a small sect of colonists who are trying to resist pirate incursions, and he implores you to help them with their plight since the Powers That Be in the universe are far too busy (or corrupt) to deal with the pirates. I didn't just do these missions for cash, but to see the story unfolded; to see how these characters reacted to these sometimes tragic events in their lives, and how they would deal with it.I think it's good to have a big Main Storyline as the main attraction, but there's plenty of room in Gemini for smaller guys with fascinating struggles and dramas in their own lives that an aspiring starship captain can be a part of. Being able to hail and talk to other ships and planets. You don't need to have dialogue trees for every one. But it'd be nice to be able to beg for mercy from a pirate and buy him off with credits, or just say hi to random ships and planets. In this vein, they'd also have a message for when you greet them, with each faction having a different way of talking to you. Perhaps even with a random pool of different types of responses from each faction that vary in tone depending on your standing with them? This is a bit small, but I think it would help with game immersion. The ships, planets, and space stations could use more flavor text.  Though it might seem like a huge hassle to write up descriptions for every space station/planet/starship, you can build an EXTREMELY immersive narrative with these and make the game feel alive. Again, the ""Escape Velocity"" game series (mostly Escape Velocity Override and Escape Velocity Nova) used flavor texts/descriptions to great effect.Why is this station in the middle of nowhere and surrounded by hostile space? Are they revolutionaries or sympathizers with another faction, or are they just badasses? Why is this Frigate cheaper than this other one? Oh, the company that manufactures this one wanted to push out a model to get an edge over their hated rival company who was taking their sweet time with their own model. Hey, this Corvette saved an entire company from the brink of bankruptcy! This Carrier design looks like a UFO because of a revolutionary new frame that allows for rapid fighter launching while providing overlapping fields of fire from all of its turret batteries? Cool. This Dreadnought looks like a eldritch abomination because their designers desperately welded a lot of spare parts together and accidentally created a ship that could challenge all previous starship design conventions? Neat! Planets and some space stations presently have short descriptions with a little flavor text. But it doesn't help that these blurbs are only accessible via starmap. When a player is on the starmap, their first instinct is not to click ""info"" and read; they want to get somewhere quick. I think it would have been better if you saw the write-up in an unobtrusive static text box on the bottom of the screen. This provides incentive for an exploration-oriented player to land/dock on every planet/station that they find so they can see the little blurb there. These descriptions can really flesh out the factions and gives you an idea of why they exist and how they conduct themselves (i.e. how they treat citizens, local planetary economic problems, policy problems, military actions, natural disasters, etc.). Overall, more flavor text would be nice so that the universe that the player travels in would feel more alive. Also, it would be nice to have an in-game chart of which ranks correspond to player level.			"

												I have been playing SG2 since EA (with many breaks in between...) and it is one of my favorite games in a long time. I've had a hard time getting into Elite, and SC is a long way out, but SG2 has filled the void admirably. I always loved space games and the WC/Privateer/Freespace trinity is pretty much my past.PROS:++ Best community on Steam. I own a lot of games and visit nearly all the forums - but this one is the best. Devs are active, the community is friendly and helpful, and some of it is satisfyingly weird (meep...) meep. MEEP.++ It's not overly complex. Which doesn't mean it's simple or dumbed down - it just means that you can jump right in and have a great time exploring space.++ Combat sequences can be exhilarating! I've been in many skirmishes that could have gone either way, frantically deploying sinks and coming around to line turrets up to open fire. Enemies coming in at all angles and PTE disrupted...++ With just a couple of mods (skyboxes and nebulas) the game can be breathtaking visually. I play with the lights off and the surround on and it is very easy to get lost in the moment.++ It's just fun. You can do a lot of different things with it and have a great time doing them. The voice acting is infamously fun bad, and the story is a kind of canned - but who cares, it's fun running through it all.++ Ultrawide!!! 3440x1440 - no problem and gorgeous!CONS:++ The economy is kind of not really there at all. I wanted to be a trader but the derelict mechanic made it more profitable and efficient to be a bad ♥♥♥ with scavenger bots. Which is kind of too bad, but it is what it is. ++ Playing the campaign like it is freeplay means you will be so OP that every enemy the campaign throws at you will be trivial to weak. Wish there was more scaling here, but it's not so bad to destroy waves of ships with out much thought because you outclass them by a mile.++ The UI is kind of crap and it's all raster so you can't mod it out to be better.++ Once you've played for a while, you start to realize that there isn't enough ship variance to keep it interesting. Some ships are clearly better than others, and you just sort of play the game out with that ship until the next tier - and its obvious captain, become available to you. I give this game an honest 10/10, even with the cons because it is a space game that you really can fall into. It really only asks for your time and patience - and doesn't require twitch muscles to play at a high level. The fire at will mechanic is great for it's tactical benefit, and for me I like to think about positioning in the large scale battles, rather than target/fire and positioning. To some it might seem like an ""easy button"" but for me it really makes the game. (i'm old... ;) )			"

												Overall the game is pretty awesome, but it could use some polish.PROS:Nice variety of skills and perks available.Great variety of factions and areas of control.Good selection of ships.Can capture enemy ships.Like the blueprints idea.Like the compare weapons and ships.CONS:Traveling over 10 units takes a couple minutes.There are four equipment slots to use and only about four that I found were actually useful, ie. shield recharge, strengthen attack, scavenger bots, hull repairs.  Even then, I rarely ever use them.Crew members do not have special abilities, but rather only bonuses.  A single slot for a special crew member.  Assuming only one special member exists in the game and is almost impossible to gain because the blueprint takes 20.Blueprints are super difficult to find, but very rewarding IF you ever complete them before becoming near god strength already.  I completed one for a nice fighter hangar jet, but the rest remain far out of reach while I am practically invincible with all the best enhancements and warship.The only truly useful weapons in the game are rail guns and maybe missiles.  I say maybe missiles because they are only really useful if the shields are already down and rail guns can usually take care of it anyway.  Lasers are useless.  Plasma is too slow to be useful except for mining.Level 70 bounties are easy kills for a level 50 that has a good battleship with maximum upgrades.  I think I may have beaten one with the next class down at a lower level too because you can stay behind them and they cannot fire back.Travelling outside the known universe area leads to infinite enemies and loss of whereabouts on the map.  Travelling too close to the sun does the same thing except enemies will start to randomly die from heat damage.Cannot see what is on a captured ship until it is transferred to the garage and crew is transferred as well.  Crew losses will occur if the captured ship has less.There are three kinds of heavy weapons, but I failed to see any real difference in shockwave damage.Exploding ships nearby do no damage.Has lag and slowdowns most of the time.SUGGESTIONS:Make traveling without gates a little faster when in full engine mode.Make some artifacts that last indefinitely / bonuses or useables that fit in equipment slots.Change the decimal enhancement descriptions, eg. 0.5, with percentage values, eg. 50%.Please fix weapon range.  Bonuses are not being counted.Add a barrier on the edge of the map to prevent getting lost in the void.Give a warning for pending heat damage when getting close to stars.Show radiation areas on the map.Show map sections that are partially visible on the edges of the map.Allow transfer of weapons and cargo from ships in the garage without transferring crew.Make plasma weapons hurt shields more, but damage hull less.Make lasers damage both shields and hull with shield punchthrough for damaging systems.Make railguns work best on hull, and less on shields.Do a similar rock paper scissors with heavy weapons.Fix the pathfinding.Improve AI for wanted bounties.

												My initial reaction to the game was ""Wow, this looks like a massive sandbox space sim! Just look at how big the area map is and how many factions there are. I'll be playing the game for tens of hours!""Well, after a while I started to realize the game had lots of problems with being a LOT more shallow than what it promises at first. Setting aside the optimization issues and how easily the game can be prone to crashing, It boasts and impressive ~50 factions with a reputation system that ended up being nothing more than a glorified Good / Evil alignment system. If you do missions given out by the good factions you get +rep and they will be friendly to you an the evil ones will be hostile. Vice versa you do missions given to you by the bad guys and your rep shifts to their side making them friendly to you. Unfortunately that is as deep as the faction system goes. Factions don't change opinions as they are completely static. The static factions leads me to the next problem. The whole world is static. There is absolutely NO sim element in this game to speak of. The game has NO economy, NO dynamic factions, NO dynamic world events. When we speak of sandbox you think of open worlds with things to do in them, but all it is here is the same map as the campaign, just without the campaign missions. Since the game lacks an economy and dynamic factions it makes trading all but a dull and soulless experience. Also, since the world isn't dynamic, there is no real territory control for the factions either. I mean they have their own territories, but they are completely set in stone. You cannot capture territories for the differenct factions. This leaves you with the same Assassination, Taxi, Cargo ferry and Repair missions to grind over and over and over again.How is the combat then if the other aspects are non-existant and hollow? Well, the combat is rather decent, but what kills it for me is how the game is level scaled. Each time you level up so do your enemies. After certain points their ships get upgraded. If you do like me and other people may have done and only grinded missions for money and XP you'll quickly find yourself in a situation where you don't have enough money to upgrade your ship but you are starting to be too weak to do missions and half the time you simply have to turn around and go away since the RNG pitted you against enemies that simply outclass you. This can be avoided if you salvage derelict ships for parts or capture them and sell them, but then it means that the level scaling system is balanced if you play in a certain way which is horrible, horrible balance in a game that claims to be a sandbox. Simply put if you aren't maximizing your money gains per level then you'll find yourself running into some issues.It just isn't a good game in the end of the day, and it certainly is no sim either, which is what I was lead to believe. There are no simulations happening behind the scenes, everything is static. The game is hardly an open world sandbox either. It seems to be a loose term that gets thrown around a lot these days. It's a sandbox world if all you had was the big open box without any of the sand in it to be shaped and sculpted by your hands. The game COULD be good, because the flying around, the skill system, the ships, the combat etc. feel good and are fun, but the content within the world is non-existant, unless you want to count repeating Kill X (Assassination and Rescue missions but both work the same. In rescue missions it means that you have to save an NPC ship, but so far they have served as reliable allies that help me take down the enemy ship faster rather than someone who needs help), Fetch Y (there is fetching and delivering cargo and serving as a taxi for VIP, but it works the same mechanically for either mission type so it's only different by name) and Repair Z (there's also Scanning anomalies as missions, but mechanically it works the exact same way as repairing so there is no real difference here either) missions as robustful content.

												This is from a post I did on the forum and decided to add it here following a suggestion to do so.SPG 2 The Good, the Bad, Oh God the InsanityIf you’re on the fence as to whether you should get this or not it will all come down to what you are looking for in a ‘space’ game.This is not Eve Online so get that out of your head. Seriously, if you want EO you’ll need to go log into EO. There is no online multiplayer, no gate camping players, no griefers and no gankers.That being said, this game offers something EO and many others, online or not, have simply forgotten or just don’t care about. Interactive Devs.Yep, you read that correctly. The Devs are extremely active in the forums. I’d hazard a guess and say 99% of all issues, questions, comments etc. are answered near instantly.They take concerns very seriously and look for ways to address them as quickly as possible, faster even it seems. While this isn’t to say other Devs aren’t around, personal experience has shown they just don’t answer, are too busy, don’t care and on more than one occasion… are downright obnoxious and rude.So +1 for Dev support seemingly 24hrs a day every day…Community… holy crap, where to begin…There are a lot of helpful people. One or two I have noticed try to step in when the Devs FINALLY get some sleep. This doesn’t mean there aren’t more filling in those roles, only that I can’t read, re-read, and re-re-read each and every post over and over to see who is filling those roles. Though, I will admit, sometimes the forum reading is an exercise in hilarity. Serious questions for the most part get serious answers. Once in a while they spiral out of control with loose jokes, odd references and such, though more or less after the issue has been handled.Remember the active Devs from earlier? Yeah… they contribute too.Don’t be surprised to find one or more of them plowing into your thread to partake of whatever silliness is afoot. Oh yes, my friend, they are characters indeed.On the whole, the community is developing into a large group of knowledgeable friendly people looking to help out any way they can. Yes, some can be offended easily, but I have yet to see an all-out flame war like everywhere else. In fact, most people just apologize if they upset someone and move on, including myself.So +1 for a truly friendly and helpful community.Graphics…Nothing that will stress your system too terribly. High end or low end, it seems everyone can find a setting that fits the bill and allows them to play. I have seen one or two instances where certain systems (read Laptops) refuse to allow the game to run, but I have yet to see more than those.Even then, the Devs are still trying to figure out how to get it working on those couple of problem machines. Interesting, since most would just tell you that your system doesn’t have what it takes and to go get something bigger.All in all, the graphics are very nice indeed. Nothing mottled, disjointed or misaligned. No missing pixels here and there or stand in objects for missing items.So +1 there for that…NPC’s…What do you expect? They are NPC’s. They shoot at you, they kill you and they keep doing it. Unless you kill them first, in which case, they die rather well and don’t whine about it. I seem to remember an account of griefing done by NPC’s, though I believe that was a one-off. Funny though.They get tougher as you progress through the game. Different levels, different types and different areas. They fight each other if they are opposing factions and will turn on you if you are low enough rep with one, or both. In which case, run.So I give a +1 for good NPC mechanics.Missions…Lots of them. They are everywhere in both aspects of the game. Free play or Story line there are tons. Decent rewards for the time invested as far as I can tell, probably a bit too decent considering some missions you just have to click a button and repair something.I’ll give a +1 here too.Storyline…For as much as I have done, it progresses well. Seems to have substance and a bit of plot for as far as I have gotten.But…It is buggy. Missions sometimes fail out. Sometimes you overshoot a zone and they get canceled, dropping you out of the storyline and into free play mode. Other times, you just crash out of the game.They are working on the bugs as fast as they are made aware of them and that helps out a lot. More often than not, you can just reload from a save point and try to continue.No points for this one, still needs work.Mods…There are more than a few. Something for everyone I suppose. Uber ship, got it. More money, got it. Star Trek themed ships, go those too.From Star Trek to vastly improve (overpowered) beginning station inventories, there is something to fit most everyone.The game has a mod community growing faster than the game itself. Even at least one mod I saw that will completely change the game to Mass Effect themed ships and even a new storyline that appears to be in the works.The Devs seem to support unlimited, no holds barred modding. So definitely +1 here.Oh, lest I forget...Community input...Look in the game. Look at achievements and improvements. You will see all the signs of active community involvement that has been taken seriously. (mostly) Yeah, +100 and some Oreos for all you community peoples that report bugs, request content changes and overall general improvements.All in all, for me, this has been one hell of a ride… and it’s just beginning. The game is only getting better and more is on the way.If you’re on the fence, get off it. Buy the game and join the fun in the community.And the insanity? Glad you asked...There are the elite few who can claim this. They watch you at home while you play. They see you in your boxers. They wear your boxers, like I am right now. The Devs are part of this group, I know one, whom I shall leave nameless, who has watched me in my boxers. Yes, some of us are insane... And that is the fun of it all.Sincerely,VirikasP.S. +1000 to the Devs for allowing us to be insane, taking us seriously when needed and for being on top of everything, everywhere, all at once, every day... always. Now... which one of you took my boxers, Meep.			"

												Well...the game looks nice but is actually quite boring. Here is why:1. Unengaging storyThe story consists of a lot of text (white on color, not very legible) and really really atrocious voice acting (which sometimes just cuts out). There are so many factions with text descriptions I did not bother to read all of them. Honestly I did not understand half of it because I have not played the predecessor. The game did not present its universe in an engaging way.2. Simple missionsThe free missions are all randomly generated but they consist  of either go to A and kill / capture or go to A and scan / repair (same menu button) or go to A and transport to B.The campaign missions are the same. Go to A and usually kill everything there...done. Sometimes you need to ferry stuff. But the whole involvement is detached. You arrive...the game cuts to sequence and some voice acting..suddenly to reappear with enemies around...you kill them...cut to the next short scene...done. There is no drama, no real action, no emotional involvment. I did not respond emotionally to the characters, who are just pictures with horrible accents.Trading and mining is a horrible grind if you like it. It is certainly helpful in the beginning but not worth your time later on. Just take the ""kill pirates"" mission and blast everything to hell.Once I got capturing ships down...I had so much money I could have bought ships that were not yet unlocked for my character level.3. Simple combatUsually you fly somewhere, click F for ""Fire at will"" and maneuver a bit around. There is not much strategy involved. Starfleet Command or Space Empires Starfury had more interesting combat. Manal aiming is cumbersome because you can't really see the ships at longer ranges and there is no help with aiming. Due to the turret placement your shots might not go where your reticle is...so automatic fire it is most of the time.Also medium difficulty is way to easy. I had a destroyer that could easily defeat a dreadnought without breaking a sweat (loosing shields).4. technical stuffAlthough the combat is in 3D the star sector is actually in 2D. The map is in 2D. You can fly ""up"" and ""down"" but it feels like all planets and stations are on the same plane. It is not a globe but rather a ""thick"" square.Flying around especially in the beginning is tedious because jumpdrives or jumpgates are way too expensive and when you have the money to buy jumps you can get a perk that allows you free use of the jump gate system.After about 10 hours the game just felt like a grind to get better ships and more weapons and do all the story missions (usually just killing enemies). It simply got boring.			"

												This game has come a long way since its beginning and it's still going strong. For me personally it went to overwhelmingly frustrating to awesomely enjoyable. The devs are super responsive and really care about the community. Keep in mind this is a tactical combat sim with trading aspects. There is a living economy, but personally I never paid any attention to it.Destroy enemy ships, capture enemy ships, loot enemy ships, grapple enemy ships, hack enemy ships. Do whatever it takes to defeat the enemy. Expansive map with plenty of variety to keep you exploring. Ships, officers, mercenaries, trading opportunities, weapons, weapon enhancements, system enhancements, equipment, etc. This game is an awesome space game in terms of what its selling point is: a tactical combat RPG space sim.

Early Access Review
								The next best thing if you want something similar to Eve and Freelancer. More arcade-ish Sci-Fi space shippy RPG. Start with a small gunship, make your way up to dreadnoughts and carriers by trading, doing freelancer missions like repairing a damaged space station, transporting a VIP from A to B, getting commodities to a planet or scanning anomalies, or just hunt criminals in hopes to get a huge bounty. The game is beautifully done, has a large selection of ships and weapons, the combat is fun although some say the camera is a bit slow, and there's a lot to do in it. Buy it! Throw money at the devs!!!! DOIT!			"

												I must preface this by saying, I don't write many reviews at all, but when I do though, it means I really enjoy the game.This game reminds me a lot of the X3 games, but the interface is a bit easier to get a grasp on.Pros:- Mod support- Great music, think Mass Effect & EVE Online style.- You can be anyone you want, and do whatever you want, there's a campaign mode, and freeform mode.- Nice interface.- Beautiful graphics.- Runs smooth, haven't experienced any crashes.  - Combat is fun.- Controller support.- There's a large selection of ships & weapons, and you can upgrade your ship.- All of the above points help with immersion, you really feel like you are in space driving your own ship.- The developers work hard and are engaged with the community.  They do have their own forums where they answer questions, etc.Cons:- Space can be a bit lonely at times, but, it is space after all.TL;DR - If you're looking for a game that is part X3, part Eve Offline that can also serve as a stopgap until Star Citizen & Elite Dangerous, you could do a lot worse than this game, especially when you consider the game is currently only $28.8/10			"

Early Access Review
								This is a very entertaining space game with a healthy side order of role playing and is pretty well polished even at this early access stage. The developers have a genuine rapport with the community and this is helping to shape a very enjoyable game. Until the final product release and all features and story campaign are implemented there is still a lot to enjoy in the sandbox mode. If you like beautiful ships, trading, chasing anomalies, blowing up asteroids and firing lasers at baddies there’s a lot to like. The music is awesome too.			"

												I like this game, I do, but 35$ I feel is too steep for what it offers. At first I thought this game was like Mount and Blade in space, with so many factions, different types of outposts, and skills oriented to being a leader. That however is not the case, the game is more or less a dungeon crawler RPG without the dungeons.The story is fairly bland, and frankly the voice acting of the main character is so outright awful I had to turn off dialogue volume, and I just quickly got bored with the story missions.Theres no real ""looting"" and going out of your way to be a merchant king through cargo hauling is a waste of time, the early portion of the game is farming money to get better ships, once you have better ships you just capture enemy ships for quick cash and farm levels. Looting ships for weapons is a waste of time, as all stations are static and theres no random element to their inventories, simply fly to the station selling the best weapon of your chosen class, and buy it, everything quickly becomes a monotony of going from X to Y and repeating.The biggest issue I have with the game is saving, the save system is abysmal. You can only save while anchored at a planet or base, if you arrive at a friendly base and find it swarming with enemies (in some sectors this happens constantly) you can find yourself trapped in a prolonged battle, or killed, when all you wanted to do was save the game and go have dinner.You cant side with factions, or take over stations, or influence anything, so dont expect any depth with the politics of the world, you are either ""good"" or ""bad"" and that determines who is friendly, nuetral, or hostile. Good being the vast majority of the galaxy. So the dozens of factions in the game, may as well be two factions.""Commanding a fleet"" isnt as exciting as I hoped either, its not so much a fleet, as you having two hirelings, hence part of my comparison to the game as a dungeon crawler.There is plenty of good though, the actual gameplay is fun, you are more captain than pilot, you configure power usage, set speed, battles arent about quick manuevering so much as overwhelming firepower and good positioning. In a star wars example, you are piloting a Star Destroyer, rather than a Tie Fighter. (fighter squadrons are in fact a system on later ships) Just be sure to go over the controls, I spent far too long without realizing you could activate automated fire.Bounties are probably my favorite aspect, unlike most games, bounty targets arent static, you start the game with a full list of bounties, and they move around the galaxy on their own, when you choose to hunt them you have to go by ""last spotted"" information and attempt to cut them off. These are also the most challenging fights available, and shouldnt be taken lightly.After a while though I begin questioning my goal, Its not difficult to get better equipment, at least not after a certain point, and the only thing you have to upgrade is your ship. A uninteresting campaign that I cant be bothered to finish? The bounty targets to award money I dont really need? Side missions that are much the same as the main missions?This game could be improved by aspects of strategy (something I think Warlords addresses, though the game is very very early access so I dare not bother with it yet.) and aspects of procedural generation. Non static stores, to put more of a emphasis on looting (Perhaps ships produced by that faction are much, much more expensive, but always available and the randomly generated ships are cheaper, like buying a new car vs. used car.) and procedurally generated weapons Diablo style. A star system you can purchase as a home base, to build your own colonies, defenses, shipyards to give you more to do than just upgrade your ship.The game has so, so, so much potential, and the team that worked on it seem dedicated and helpful to their community, the framework is here for a game unlike any other, and I am excited by where the team goes with warlords once its finished. If you can nab this for $20 or less, do it. But in the end, whats that phrase? A mile wide, a inch deep.			"

												** A gorgeous space game marred by painful lore elements.**      [[Recommendation comes with strong suggestion to play in sandbox mode only]]This game was an odd experience.  The longer I played it, the less I liked it.When it started, it took me back to the wonder of games like Privateer.  Sandbox, big galaxy, lots of options.  And it's really gorgeous, from the ships to the planets to the nebulous backgrounds.  Some of space stations look oddly low-res compared to everything else, but that's minor.However, things went downhill when I started to follow the main story campaign.  The voice acting is truly atrocious, and the writing isn't much better, from the minor (bad grammar) to the median (dialogue) to the major (an incoherent plot with characters whose motives don't seem to correspond to events).  And when you get to a more difficult mission that you have to try several times, the lack of any button to skip the dialogue becomes truly unforgivable.Speaking of retrying, there are several design decisions that make sense on their own, but quickly become annoying when you have to replay a mission because it's difficult or bugged (like the infamous mothership mission).  First, you can save only at stations or planets.  OK, there's a sort of 'realism' sense to that.  Second, there's a lot of empty space between points of interest.  That actually worked for me at first, because it added to the sense of scale and exploration.  But when you have to retry a mission and reload to find you are about a 5 minute cruise from the action -- and then remember that you'll have to sit through 3 more minutes of unskippable community theatre auditions when you get there -- it gets really difficult to stick with it for the next attempt.There were also a number of minor annoyances, like the fact that missions seem to get reset when you load a game (so if you pick up someone or something to deliver, you must do it before you end your current session or forever have that passenger or item in your non-cargo inventory), some inscrutable elements, several mechanics that seemed incomplete, and a handful of crash bugs.I think there are the ingredients of a good game here, with a good core and beautiful graphics, but the lore side of things really lets those elements down.  Perhaps the best strategy would be to ignore the story and play only in sandbox mode.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a space trading and combat game, think Elite or EVE. You fly around a vast galaxy, smaller than in EVE or Elite though, doing missions, trading, mining, bounty hunting, etc. Captain your ship and level your captain in a RPG-like fashion. I turned to SG2 for that EVE Online fix. I would call it a simplistic EVE, but it's still very good to scratch that EVE itch. You can forget about the RPG system, it's so simplistic, but the rest is a full fledged space game. The game's looks take a little getting used to, coming from sharp and shiny EVE or Elite gfx, but after a while it grows on you and flying around the galaxy is as fun as usual.Getting through the story and all dlcs can take about 50 hrs, then there's some additional hrs if you want to replay SG story in SG2 engine, and then there is freeroam. Freeroam will not be so fun after completing everything as your ship will obliterate everything that the game throws at you, but still, 50-70hrs of game time looks quite amazing considering you can get this on sale.I liked:* quite a large map* lots of different ships* large amount of weapons and enhancements* flying in space shooting / trading / uncovering stuff!I disliked:* capturing ships is the only way to go if you want to make big bucksGet this:* if you're looking for EVE Offline and don't mind simpler experience* if you want to fly in space and pew pew stuffDon't get this:* if you're looking for complex space sim			"

												I really wish I could recommend this game, but it's a buggy, unfinished mess.  I can't believe the state the developers left this in before abandoning it and moving onto their next project; Starpoint Warlords, which I would highly advise people to stay away from as well.  Aside from the persistent crashing, there are parts of the game the developer just didn't even bother to finish.  For instance, none of the equipment that was introduced with the expansions works.  None of it.  The developers are completely aware of it too, they just never bothered to finish it.  Simple things like being able to skip dialog doesn't work because of ""technical reasons"".  I kid you not, that's their excuse, but it supposedly works on xbox.  Many of the quests are bugged, including the final mission, and require hacking save files or reloading the mission numerous times until it works.  Voice dialog worked for maybe a third of the game, the rest of it you just have to read the dialog and then wait in silence until what should have been voiced over to finish since, again, you can't do something as simple as skip dialog.  Character/story progression is very poorly thought out.  It wasn't until I got about 10 hours in, when I was getting wrecked by even the lowliest of enemies, that I had to go to the forums to find out you shouldn't do any missions because you'll over level yourself but not have enough money to buy a new ship and essentially have to start all over or hack your save file to give yourself credits.  Nope, you're supposed to just go capture ships for money and not do any missions.  I'm not kidding, you aren't supposed to level up or do missions or you'll break your game.  I'm not even going to list out all of the other bugs the devs are aware of that they just never bothered to fix.  Stuff that was brought up back in 2014 during the beta that they said they would fix and just never bothered with.  I could probably go on for another three paragarphs listing all the issues with this game, but suffice it to say, it's a mess.  I'm hard pressed to recall any other game I've played that was left in such a sad state, it's like a beta release.  It's a huge shame too, because there is a really good game hiding underneath all the garbage, but having finished the game, the incredible amount of laziness and carelessness by the devs and the amount of frustration it causes just ruins it.  I have no tolerance for devs that abandon a game like they have here and then move on to their next cash in.  I will never purchase another game from Iceberg Interactive.			"

												Loved this game. Felt like Privateer 2 without the cutscenes and sadly missing Clive Owen with Christopher Walkins :-( Freelancer should've been more like this. SG2 is a lot more open world than Freelancer which has its advantages and disadvantages. Personally, I found it purely an advantage. Unlike Privateer 2 and Freelancer you can truly just be a merchant if you want and switch effortlessly to being a badass kill everything murder ship at any space station/planet. Sometimes it's just the little things that make you happy... The graphics are great, the music not annoying, the abundance/ease of quickly accepting missions is a serious plus, and most importantly the flexibility of the game to allow someone the ability to play  the game how they want w/out the need of trainers, cheat codes, or cheat engine. Just like in the real world there are easy ways to make a quick buck with minimal returns or riskier methods that garnish heavy monetary rewards. I love that this game isn't afraid to make the playing field drastically uneven when it comes to rewards. Harder, almost always (there are times you get lucky/learn to exploit advantageous situations), means greater rewards! Learning the in game market is very beneficial. But it gets better, should you disagree w/me all you have to do is download any of the many mods and change how the game mechanics work. This game is a literal win-win. Small minor bonus pluses that I think are worth mentioning are; 1.) Achievements actually give you in game bonuses 2.) Blueprints that give better stuff that can't be bought 3.) Bounty hunting ( this is a mixed bag. this system could better implemented but I'll be damned if i didn't end up hunting everyone down!) 4.) Buying of certificates/licenses (w/game money and not real money) that give-in game bonuses for no other reason but to make the game fun (personally, I think it could have been better implemented but I sure as ♥♥♥♥ was excited to find a new one!). 5.) A good array of ships to pick from (potentially unlimited if you count mods... Just saying...) 6.) Personally, I found the system upgrade gimmick confusing at 1st but once understood, it opens the door to a lot of options that becomes unlimited if you include modding (just saying...).No game is perfect and this one isn't either. This is the disadvantage section of SG2. SG2 has some pretty poor optimization problems. 4-5 years ago my PC was a champ so it's aged a bit meow. Still, w/the level of graphics/visuals/objects it should run better. Especially since the video/graphics adjustment is bugged/non-functional. It's only a moderate complaint because the game allows mods and several are designed to reduce the toll taken on your PC. The rest of the comaplaints are mild at best because all are easily adjusted w/mods or are drastically overshadowed by the game's massive, bulging, make you scream in your pillow as you take it awesomeness so here goes- 1.) The voicovers are almost all a joke. They're done w/the stalest emotion possible. 2.) The story is kinda flat. Open ended games are prone to this a lot so it obviousley shouldn't be a huge unseen problem here. The game brings up interesting things here and there so kudos for the Devs for trying but it is still kinda... ummm... blah most of the time (kudos for the DEVs for doing such a good job to make the game so fun I really didn't care!) In short, my complaints are minimal at best and I had countless hours of fun playing it. I found it quick and easy to learn and SG2 left a lot of options for me to explore for future play throughs. I can't ask a game to do more than that but w/mods this game could be literally different everytime I played. I got it on sale and felt like I stole something. I would have happily paid full price and been more than content. This game is awesome, WOOF!			"

Early Access Review
								As a long-time fan of the great grandfathers of space trading, exploration and combat games, (Elite, Wing Commander, Privateer). I am always on the lookout for a game of this genre that has the feel and enjoyment these classics gave.Starpoint Gemini 2 goes a long way to bringing back those days in a modern, eye pleasing, fun package that is not overly complex like some of the modern games ( later X Series, EVE Online) which although are great games and in many ways superior, probably due to much larger budgets, leave me feeling like I have just sat the final papers to a master’s degree.Starpoint Gemini 2 which is still in beta at time of writing this review, shows great promise and I eagerly look forward to the future updates and release of this enjoyably challenging game.I hope to add additional updates to this review as new releases come out and I explore the game further.

												Well-made hybrid of SG1 and Freelancer. with light RPG elements on top.Pros+Vast selection of ships from fighters to dreadnaughts and carriers+Engaging combat+diverse systemsCons-Lack of persistent objects. You won't see ships traveling from one system to another, because they are always generated when you enter a system.-There is like 30 factions, but reputation system is two-dimensional. So when you help one faction you improve/worsen relation with the rest of them.-Below average performance.7/10 (8 of 10 if the they fix bugs and improve optimization), worth buying if you are into space genre. If you are not, you can wait for Christmas sale, a lot of things should be fixed by then.			"

								The playstyle is an assorted combination of the Freelancer + tactical elements of Star Wolves + diversity of EV Nova + some good original ideas on top.Do you remember that feeling of excitement when you discover something, something that makes you feel more alive? I feel a deep immersion when playing this game which is so rare nowadays (even in alpha state atm (nov 2013), with only a basic features present). The devs put a part of their souls into creation of this, I feel it in all those small details here and there. I'm looking forward for a release, and quite positive that anyone who loves ""space sims"" won't be disappointed with this game, especially with such a good modding support.			"

												I wish I hadn't bought this game. I loved Freelancer and thought it would be something similar but boy was I wrong.This game lacks any atmosphere and feeling of a space-traveling universe. Docking at stations and visiting stations is one of the most disappointing events I ever encountered in a space game. There is no radio chatter, no clearance for docking; you never hear anybody over radio nor do you see more than one or two ships (even near well populated planets!). This game feels so incredibly dead and empty, that travelling and exploring just simply isn't any fun at all. It all feels so static. Add to that that planets and stations you visit are not animated but all just have a static, bland screensaver in the background of dull buying menues. There are no bars or other places that give you the feeling of really setting a foot on a place. Rather it all feels so incredibly generic and it doesn't get better if you add the boring ""go there and kill pirate x""-missions that we all have seen way too often now.This game is nowhere near Freelancer and if you look for something like that, you will most likely be as disappointed as I am. This is a sad and empty game and I would be careful to get carried away by the positive albeit misleading reviews here.			"

												TL;DR version - GET IT! Fun as heck! Some minor issues and bugs but devs are hard at work on fixing them!Ok as far as space games go, this is ""easy to get into"" and ""fun"" to me. Easy once you actually READ the tutorial tips and understand how it all works. And it's fun cuz I found myself needing to ""just go over to that next unexplored sector"" to see what's there.However, you can't compare this game to another game like X, or Star Citizen, or Elite Dangerous. It's like asking if Diablo 3 is like Skyrim - they simply can't be compared fairly. The only thing in common between this game and the game you want to compare to is just that the action takes place in ""space"". How it makes the gameplay fun is different from the one you want to compare to.If you want to ask ""Does it have <this feature> like <the other game you want to compare to>?"", don't. Go back and read my previous comment.What I can tell you is that this game feels like an RPG more than a Space Combat game. There is a story. You upgrade your weapons and armour. You kill your enemies and loot their corpses (derelict wrecks). You use what is better than yours and you sell what is not. See? Just like an RPG.You can do some trading, but I don't concentrate on it like I would have in X or Elite Dangerous. In the end, the question is - does it make you feel that you want to play this more? Does it make you want to see what happens next?The answer is YES for me.			"

Not much, just things I personally prefer.  Others might consider some of these to be ProsNo multi-player optionsNo empire to buildFreelance missions do not have much variety.The officer system is a little strange.  You can only hire them in their original location, they go home when you fire them, then you have to fly back there to hire them again.You can't equip ships unless you are piloting them.  This can cause you to lose crew or be forced to sell cargo.You might like Starpoint Gemini 2 if you like these games. Freelancer, X3-series, Eve Online, and space based games in general "

												A good game that could have been a great game.After several hour of play the missions quickly get repetitive. Trading and mining get boring even quicker. The real challenge of the game is capturing enemy ships (and it is the only way to make enough money to advance in the game).The faction system didn't much much sense to me, and didn't seem very important as it was just goodies vs badies in the end.Near the end game there was nothing to spend your cash on. The weapons at the end of the game really aren't much better than what you get 20% into the game.The game crashes from time to time, but not enough to ruin the game thanks to the auto-save feature. It is a 32bit only game and seems to run out of virtual RAM. The developers should have also included a 64bit executable in the install package.So, good fun for maybe 20 hours.Some suggestions as to what would have made this a great game.- Some ship customisation (and why can't I see the weapon arcs)- More variety in the  enemy ships (maybe some boss ships)- Some random system wide events. Not just random pirates- The hacking (and anti-hacking) features making some sense. I didn't get hacked ever, but had zero protection.- More high end weapons and gear- The galaxy having low and high level sections rather than being seemingly mostly uniform. At the moment sectors are either friendly or impossibly hard.  I never found any netural sectors.			"

												Most have taken to calling this EVE offline, but I find it to be more EVE Lite or Diet EVE. Think the core concepts of EVE in an open sandbox map rather than many separate systems, but with the waiting 5 months for a skill replaced by grinding for a few hours and all the player interaction removed.At the end of the day you're left with all the things that made EVE great, with none of the stuff that makes it only suitable for people with vast swaths of time available. You can jump in, do a quick mission, save and jump out. You don't have to worry about being dicknailed by a ship fifty levels higher than you at any given time, and you get an experience that's much more simple than EVE.I'll reccomend it. I've come across some bugs, and the voice acting is really, really bad at times, and just pretty bad at others. Personally I think the 20 bucks out of pocket I paid (had 6 bucks steam credit) was in the right area for the game, maybe a little high. I'd say buy at 5-15 for sure and 20+ only if you like the sounds of EVE Jr.			"

												(8/10) Pros: -Freelancer 2.0 -Capitol ships. -Ability to capture vessels and own them or sell them. -Ability to lead a small fleet -Simple control scheme, complex battle needs. -Runs perfectly smooth for my mid grade computer-Story line is not overly complex and compels you to keep upgrading your ship/fleet/character in order to surviveCons:  -Some dlc quests may get bugged if you load all DLC at start of a save.  Forums have workarounds to help solve issues though-Capturing ship to sell profit far out scales all other methods of profit (trade, mining, missions, etc) and after a playthrough of a character/ship tuned for this method, all other methods feel like roleplay, comparatively.Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game extremely like Microsoft's Freelancer however instead of a choice of around 10* fighter sized ships (in vanilla freelancer), you will be getting a plethora of capitol sized ships from transports, frigates, cruisers, destroyers, and so on up to carrier and dreadnaught.  Titan class if you get that dlc too.Gameplay wise the game features easy controls to help you manage power towards shields, weapon batteries, and thrust, and you will be required to fluctuate this power as the game progesses and the needs of battle and speed get more intense.I found the ui and gameplay to be very good.  This game has been the best open space trader sim that I've played on steam yet.Late game battles can be intense and even if you power through tens of ships at a time, you will need to be vigilant in your positioning, use of power, and abilites.

												Pros: + Beautiful game; very nice to look at!+ Lots of small interesting mechanics and ideas, such as boarding other ships, hacking their systems, etc.+ Mining and trading are well implemented, although it's very hard to get rich through either+ Plenty of unique ship designs and overall great attention to art+ Very decent music and sound effectsCons:- Boring story- Abysmal voice acting- No multiplayer- Excessively combat-focused (good luck getting rich as a merchant)- easter egg hunt (in a space sim? sigh, okay)- only one star system, seems limited for a space sim- the prices for using the jump gates are insane, get your podcast playlist ready and have fun trucking through space- lack of animations for entering or leaving stations/planets (yeah this one is a bit nitpicky)- placing stations and artifact containers right next to riftways is borderline sadistic- what REALLY pushed me away from this game:WELCOME TO USER INTERFACE HELL!oh my god, this game's interface makes me want to stick puppies in a blender! --> fifty thousand menus that don't give you all the information you need--> 'why can't I select this station? oh the waypoint marker is in the way, let me place it somewhere else for the 1000th time so I can move on with the docking procedure' (same thing applied to any static object in space you hope to interact with)--> 'does a green price mean it's a good sell, or does it mean the price is very low?'--> 'why can't I use the turret camera while in PTE mode?! oh, I can, but I need to press Mouse1 simultaneously. wtf?'--> 'time to compare some prices, now let me just find the item in this huge list which isn't alphabetically organized'--> I spent several hours having to remind myself that the BLUE bar under the red HP bar doesn't represent shield, but speed. Why do I need a speed bar? God only knows. And one that looks like a shield bar, on top of all.--> I could go on, but the point is: if this game's UI had been better conceived, SG2 wouldn't have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so often. I'm not saying it's a bad game, just that... it's not great fun. I guess that's enough.			"

												TLDR: If you are looking for a Elite type game look elsewhere!  If you are looking for a casual game where you can capture ships, command a carrier, and be a rich badass. Then this is for you.  At first glance I wasn't impressed by this game. Found the controls/interface a bit clunky, voice acting cheesy to say the least.

												Updated review as of October 1st.First impressions: Broken. With a lot of potential.Secondary impressions: It's an acquired taste. It does grow on you. But it's lopsided. Strong gameplay props up a (very) weak campaign.Initial review:This game may be out of early access, but do not be fooled. This is NOT a finished product. Not even close. It is sorely lacking in decent voice acting, and the campaign hangs together by the thinnest of threads, and liberal deus ex machina. Frequently you will look at the screen in confusion and ask ""Who is that? What is happening? Why am I supposed to do this?"" The game approaches storytelling in a very basic, almost childish way. Even in my short time in the game, I have already encountered several borderline-gamebreaking bugs. Such as non-functional campaign triggers. And equally game-breaking, though no bug, is the games tendency to assume the player knows more that he does. This game needs a softer introduction, not to mechanics, but to world-building. As it is, it's a mess.I am giving the developer the benefit of doubt, and I will continue playing. I do believe there is a lot of enjoyable content to come. But ""it gets better later"" is not a defence that a genuinely good game would need.Let me put it like this: I am playing the game simply because it is the only game of its kind currently available. If it weren't for the fact that I have played Freelancer into the ground repeatedly, I would be playing that. It is a superior experience in every way.Currently, I still regret spending money on this game. Therefore I am choosing not to recommend this game.Update #1: After a few more hours, I can only confirm my first impressions: I have absolutely no idea what is going on in the game, and my enjoyment of it suffers as a result. Time and time again, I am told I need to go to some place I don't know of, to meet a person I've never heard of, to get a thing which I know nothing about, for reasons that are never made clear. To call it frustrating is an understatement. The game is seemingly an unending series of unanswered questions. Primary among them: ""Why am I doing this?""This is not intentional mystery, this is just really, really bad writing.Which is a damn, crying shame. Because the game itself, mechanics and graphics, are solid. Ish. A little shallow and clumsy, perhaps, but the closest I have come to Freelancer since Freelancer.I wish this game was better. But it isn't. I wish I could love this game. But I can't.I have given this game more than its fair share of chances. I have given it more than the benefit of doubt. I have acted on faith, on the belief and the hope, that this game ""gets better"". So far, this has proven to be wishful thinking.I'll research the Gemini universe, and see if that gives me enough points of reference to piece together just what the hell is going on in the game. Then I'll give the game one last chance to pull itself out of this confusing funk and make some damn sense.Update #2:That helped a lot. A now have a fair grasp of what the game was assuming I knew by heart all along. It made the campaign bearable, though still not good by any measure. But at least I'm no longer tearing my hair out (as much) over the lack of proper world-building, exposition and adherence to storytelling 101.I still can't recommend the game, despite that I am now beginning to enjoy it. Chances are that you won't be as patient as I have been, and I fail to muster any decent arguments as to why you would wish to be.			"

 Review - Starpoint Gemini 2 === Rating: 7.0 / 10 - To boldly grind as much as nobody grinded before === The Good - Good variety of pilotable vessels for various play styles: mining freighters, battleships, fighter carriers, it's all there- RPG elements and alignments system enable the player to take the path they wish in both terms of abilities, perks and behaivior- Fairly good, but not excellent mind you, number of different sectors to explore- Main quest, a load of secondary missions, contracts, bounties, random encounters, global events... really, there is a lot of stuff to actually do in the Gemini Sector...- Decent assortment of weaponry and modifications- Space anomalies, ion storms, radioactive nebulas, and all sorts of space disasters to endanger your ship- It takes really long to get to high levels, get all the good ships, weaponry, kill bounty targets and such things- Quite complex but rewarding enemy ship capture system, you can really do an awful lot of money if you get good at it...- Overall, more than good longevity, to complete everything the Gemini Sector has to offer, DLCs included, it will take you, say around... 100 hours (i played the beta version before release in the past and did so)=== The Bad - Trading / Mining / Gas collecting / Scrap salvaging are good for making money at low levels, game start and quite a bit after, but from say level 15/20 and above, they become very underwhelming: contracts, bounties and most of all ship boarding surpass the gains by FAR, so players that want to play a Trading type character will be severely penalized in mid/late game and will have to do epic amounts of grinding to get anything- You cannot destroy space structures if they are not part of a specified mission that involves their destruction. Solar arrays, gas collectors, bandit space stations, trading posts, all of them are completely indestructible: their structure will drop to 0 eventually but will still be perfectly fine. This MIGHT be a game design choice to avoid players break main quests and such, BUT doing so with all space structures is really unacceptable- You can board space structures, and plausibly get all the sweet loot inside them right? Wrong my friends. Board a mining station, a resarch center or such, and the troops will say it is captured and the loot is being ejected outside: this will not happen. Never, ever. This feature might be incomplete or never finished by developers.- You can only save your game while docked to a space station or a planet. Not a really big deal, just a poor game design choice- Ship's autopilot can bug and randomly fly you inside space stations, space debris, asteroids, and turn your ship in a fireball.- The ship's targeting computer is not able to target automatically asteroids or salvage piles, if you want to be a miner, be prepared to aim at every single little piece of asteroid manually and then collect its loot. This makes mining even more painful than it already is because of the problem i explained before- The ship's targeting computer (yes, AGAIN) is able to, thankfully, target enemies in automatic fire mode, and is pretty accurate at it, more so than you doing it manually in fact, but the big issue is: the computer will randomly fire at all enemies in its range, and will NOT stay and focus fire on the enemy you locked on. You should understand how this will do in a battle. Yes, really bad.=== The Ugly - When boarding a ship, ANY ally ship, be it random, hired mercenaries or quest companions, will STILL target the enemy ship you are trying to board, and there is NO WAY to tell them to do otherwise. This results in extreme frustration because maybe you are actually succeeding in the believe me really difficult task of capturing a ship (especially at high levels), but then some random ally blows it up making you lose time, your troopers inside it, and maybe also a mission involving the ship capture will fail. The developers said this WOULD be fixed many times on forums and steam hub, well it never was.- Ship capture is the ONLY feasible way of making good amounts of money from mid game and above: contracts will start giving you a pittance, trading will long be worthless and selling those nice ships for money will be your only chance of making money to get better stuff and ships to actually progress in the story or freeroam, because enemies scale with your level and get better everything, and so you must do the same. Yes you guessed it, the thing i said before about boarding, it happens a LOT, so you can choose between getting ulcer from boarding, or grinding 70 contracts in say 6 hours to get 1 tier III weapon for that slot you are missing, and then again and again and again.- There is a bug that can happen randomly, i presume it is uncommon: after completing a Main Story or DLC Main quest (Happened to me just after finishing Aethera DLC), and this is a really severe bug. What it does is simple: it RESETS the entire quest line of the main story to a random mission, so basically instead of progressing to the next quest, it says the actual active quest is one you ALREADY completed, and i found no fix for this, system cache check, restarting, even savegame editing, nothing. This has lead me to be unable to play Titans DLC because the quest is broken, and who knows what sorts of troubles will other players get from this bug.=== Conclusions Honestly, SG2 is a nice space game, nowhere near the depth of some other games like the X series, but positively much more accessible than those, but still being complex enough to not become casualized, and that is all good.Still, many problems as you read cripple the game and prevent it from becoming truly excellent.

												This is a good game for space adventurers. However, there should be an emphasis on the word ""adventure"" more than action on this one. There is story here, but I find the game play is slightly lacking. The idea of controlling a modify-able ship is awesome, especially with the ability to turn auto-firing and auto-pilot on and off - but I just find this game lacks a bit in depth. There is a lot to do, a lot of side missions, main missions are intriguing enough, but SG2 just fails to deliver amazing game play. Maybe it's because I'm playing with a controller, but I find from the stuff you can do in game to scanning or teleporting is not quite there. You cannot walk around space ports or your own ship which is really disappointing because what captain doesn't want to see what's going on - on his/her ship. I find myself always chasing new nav points and flying in circles and turning on auto-firing.I like the game, but enough to pass time or keep me busy. I do not think it's worth the stated price and recommended to buy on sale.RATING : 7/10 Gameplay C+ Story / Campaign B+ Visuals / User Interface B- Sounds / Music C+ Replay-ability C+ Overall  C+ "

There may be a bug here and there, but the Dev team is really on top of it. It's about all been flushed out. So if you have been on the fence, and want a feeling like playing Freelancer for the first time. You should give this a go. And, with a active Mod community, Im sure there will be years of fun in the future of Starpoint Gemini 2!!			"

												Finally out of Early Access, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great entry point into the genre. While you're waiting for things like Elite and Star Citizen to come down in price (or release), this is an excellent stop gap game. While the science behind it isn't world-accurate like other games, the pure amount of things to do and systems in play is excellent. Workshop support is excellent and the modding API is well detailed on the developer website.			"

												This game gets compared to Freelancer a lot (particularly by forums users), but it's like a poor man's version of Freelancer without any of its artistry or high points like the lore backgrounding the game, and the great universe design. There are similar mechanics: do some basic trading, have a ship...TBH it is a bit of a disappointment after the hype you hear about it from fans. To be really blunt in its current state I think this is a $10 max game. It feels a bit like it would be a good iOS space game, but as yet isn't a good PC space game. It needs an additional layer of depth and polish to become anything more than average. I'm playing it a bit but it's mostly as a time filler and because its a pretty massive grind to get anywhere (which I assume covers for a lack of content).The forums seem to be an unadulterated love fest for this game and that was one of the main things that swayed me, but it's fairly average so far. I think it has something to do with the developers being active on the forums, big-upping anyone that says anything positive. Will update this review if my opinion changes, but I have a pretty good picture of the core dynamics: capture till you get a bigger ship, capture till you get a bigger ship until you get the biggest ship. Do really boring missions until you get your rank up. Otherwise you might do the really boring version of trading or mining (compared to other games).THE BAD Tutorial and the campaign to date are pretty bad and unengaging (I kinda know what I'm doing but just don't care). Visuals are mediocre, although the ship art is okay. Universe feels empty in a bad way. Voice acting in the plot is amateur. You can only save in certain places which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ (there are some lackluster excuses about this) Combat seems fairly one dimensional RPG elements are lighter than I expected (4 skills that you level, and some perks) Crew are just stats bonuses Trading economy and mining seem extremely basicOverall I think a game like Starsector has far more RPG depth.THE GOOD...You can customise ship colours, decals, and names so we can all call our ship Stormbringer, however, I haven't tried naming one Mistake Not My Current State Of Joshing Gentle Peevishness For The Awesome And Terrible Majesty Of The Towering Seas Of Ire That Are Themselves The Milquetoast Shallows Fringing My Vast Oceans Of Wrath - it might be possible.The cosmetic stuff like naming the ships and changing colours seems to be my high point so far. It might end up being a good timewaster...here's hoping.			"

												Sorry for the negative review, but I found this game frustratingly boring...- The game is a real grind…. -Freighting cargo around doesn't pay well at all, and I installed a mod to try and solve that issue, but seemed to not help.-The story did not capture my interest. With sad voice acting, and the death of the characters farther on the “second” mission, I felt nothing for it, and was simply poorly laid out. -Not a fan of the combat, it's clunky, panning the turret cam is slowed in combat. (that could be due to my system but the graphics run fine in combat, I suspect it's something else) -A lot of the free roaming play is go here, go there... with not much inbetween. maybe some random combat…-No feedback on some systems, if you can't charge your engines in combat, no way to tell how long they will take to comeoneline, or I didn't find any readout to tell me… -not a fan of magical powerups/skills but that just my preference-The sell all button is poorly placed with no confirmation, will also fail you if you're smuggling. you can't buy it back to complete the mission… sigh...-Not a fan of the docking anchoring system. it makes the long or short trips that much more unsatisfying :( -missions seem to be straightforward but lack information… eg. where am I smuggling this to? You want help, what kind of help? Missions simply lack information that would give you the choice to make a educated decision. -Combat music sounds very VERY similar to Freelancer... just putting that out there...I have tried to get into the game twice, tried to give it a chance. I have put 13 hours into the game... I don't feel there is any need to put more.I strongly recommend anyone considering purchasing this title to thurellery research it on youtube or forums, as actual game footage it not supplied on steam, and is quite misleading...

												So here's the kind of stuff that happens in SG2:I'm flying in my cloaked Freya-class stealth carrier towards a small fleet of enemy vessels. I drop to cruising speed (drawing power from engines to weapons + shields) in the middle of the ship cluster and release 1 wing each of fighters + bombers, which wreak havoc in their ranks. I lock a grappling beam on the flagship, drop out of cloak and set weapons free. Turning the ship, I shoot missile salvos from my port, bow and starboard ports, crushing the flaship's shields and bringing hull integrity to critical levels. I then use transporters to launch a boarding party, which subdues the vessel's defenders in less than a minute. All the while my guns, bombers and fighters make short work of the supporting vessels and I leave with a prize ship worth millions of credits.That's the game in a nutshell. It's really, really, really cool and accomplishes what few games like it can... but has giant glaring holes in it. I recommend the game if you get it on sale or if you don't mind taking the good with the bad. I'm not one of those weird people who likes s***ty games and *I* played it for 55 hours and counting.Here are my gripes:* Capturing ships? Yeah, pretty much the only sensible thing to do towards the end game for cash.* The system is kind of arcane. Most of it becomes intuitive after you get a chance to tweak it (for instance, I've set my mouse page Back/Forward buttons to lock on the nearest target and mark it for fighters/fleet vessels). However... it wasn't until like 40-50 hours into the game that I realized that ""Power-To-Engines"" didn't actually put full power to engines and you boosted speed significantly if you used the power allocation tab to set Engines to 100% while in PTE mode.* AI is miserably weak. Boarding actions? They don't do 'em. Hacking your ship? Yeah they don't do that either. Grappling? Hahaha no. They seem to just go towards the nearest enemy and shoot. The most complicated thing they do is use items that drop mines or kill your fighters or knock out your engines. It leads to ridiculous situations like my Freya ship with 110 troopers destroying 6 Equinox-class carriers with 130 troopers each... when just two of them could almost guarantee taking my ship by boarding. Same goes when I'm wrecking a freighter with a small corvette-class fighter/bomber... and it could easily knock me out of commission by grappling me and pounding me to dust.* The dialogue killed my parents. Seriously... this stuff comes across as written by a middle-schooler, translated to Russian-and-back, and voiced in the dumbest, least engaging way possible. Worst of all.. it's unskippable! There's a command for ""skip dialogue"" but it DOESN'T WORK.			"

												Update : Now LIVE V1.400 (Internal Test build)I myself have been playing since Alpha (September 2013 release) and I have seen SPG2 come along in strides. Below is a basic list of what is in-game and can be done whilst playing. SPG2 brings back many memories of quite a few spaces games I have played since the mid 80's onwards.Star Point Gemini 2!DLC - Secrets of Aethera - Adds in new ships, new storyline arc, tweaks and updates to game systems.Riftways - Oh my, something to experience yourself! - Rollercoaster rides in Space.Fighter wings for ships with hanger bays are a blast to play with.70 ships to buy/capture/destroyEquipment/Weapons that can be modified with enhancementsCustomizable ship - Can re-color certain parts of your ship, add decals etc.Consumables - Shield boosters, damage boosters, repair nanobots, etcPower ups - Boost your Railgun damage, or Beam weapons etc for a few seconds to turn the tide in battle (Use them wisely though as they have a cool down for re-use)Ship cloaking (Ships that have cloak devices) - A lot of fun with this one :)Hero Characters to hunt down and kill for excellent credit reward. (You can kill a few of us Forum members now as Hero Characters! - Thanks to LGM's competition)Global events - More fun things to do outside of freelance missions etc.Junk yards - Cruise the junk yard like a junk yard dog looking for some possible cargo and or poor unsuspecting ships that might contain some nice cargo to liberate from them.Trade your wares in stations and planets that you either bought elsewhere or collected from combat or mining. (Price balancing to still be finalized)Board and capture ships - Hire troopers and grapple a ship, send in the troops and take over that ship for some extra credits or to take as your own new ship.Worm Holes appear around the galaxy and can whip you to somewhere else in no time (Be warned you might turn up somewhere ""You dont want to be"")AI Security forces scan you ship for contraband and give you an option to dump it or duke it out (Pirates life for me, damn the pollice hehe)T-drives work as personal T-Gates to quickly jump to other areas very quickly (Same as using T-Gate, but on the spot usage, instead of finding a T-Gate)Ability to hanger (Personal hanger accessed via stations and planets) upto 5 ships, which you can swap out when needed. Have a freighter parked in your hanger when you want to do those big commodity runs for the big bucks, or some large scale asteroid mining. Drag out your carrier to go out and take on fleets of enemies with your weapons and your fighter wings.Travel the Galaxy map by normal engine power (I have done this and it takes quite some time - grab a coffee and some food), Power to engines (faster travel speed) or by Fast travel ways (Real fast movement across the galaxy)Freelance missions, Combat, repair, scan, VIP Courier, Cargo courier the list goes on.Steam Workshop - Mods are coming along and many more to come as modders get busy!Did I mention how bloody good the galaxy looks, Nebula's are amazing, Asteroid fields are real special (I like to play a pirate, so I like to hide in the dust clouds of some asteroid fields and wait for passing freighters/mining ships for some easy kills and loots. Junk yards look great, and just a reminder again don't run into them they not hurt hehe :)Oh and Mod Tools, Want to add a new ship into game, can do!!Want to add new sectors into game, Can do!!Want to add anything virtually into game, can do!!! Probably the best thing of all about SPG2 is the Dev Team, These people are one of the best I have had the pleasure of enjoying an alpha/beta release with. They are always responding to members posts, questions, technical help, and ideas. The Dev Team have even taken ideas from members and have put into game those ideas, what more can you ask for in a Dev Team who cares just as much for the player base as their game, that is simply priceless and a quality lacking in many AAA title Dev Teams.All I can say is, ""If you enjoy space gaming, Buy SPG2 today. You wont be disappointed""And drop by the official forums and say hello as well :)http://www.starpointgemini.com/forumhttp://www.twitch.tv/webferret - My Stream of SPG2 most nights 8PM AEST (GMT +9:30)			"

												I love space sims. I don't even know how much time I sank into freelancer or the x3 games. Yet this one I am dropping after a bit more than 10 hours of playing.Let's start with what I like about this game: The graphics are good, the different ships with their various layouts are cool, you can customize your ship through enhancements and hiring officers, the energy transfer management (engine, weapons, shields) is interesting, and on the surface the game feels like it is trying to marry the best parts of freelancer with those from the x series (which means many things immediately make sense if you have played those games before).However. Somehow the game feels like a chore; something I am willing myself to play in the hope that if I continue a bit further it will finally become exciting and turn into the great game it has the potential to be.The story is inherently boring. Fly from A to B, listen to some terrible voice-overs, destroy a target (ambushes being optional), get an (uninteresting and unusable) item and no real information other than ""fly to XYZ to get more info"". But you need to grind a few side missions first to level up enough for that. Rinse and repeat. I have lost all interest in the main story and there is just nothing that compels me to continue playing it.The other sidequests and missions are okay, but also very repetitive. The difficulty rating of these is useless, as some missions (e.g. science, maintenance, taxi, ferry) are childishly easy, whereas others (e.g. assasination, station defence) become really hard quickly unless you sink all your money into your fighting capabilities. Importantly the missions don't pay enough in my eyes to make them worthwile. I found boarding other small ships much more lucrative. And flying through space feeling like you are a towing service is just not fun for long. These side missions quickly turn into mindless grinding.There are many other things that bug me (not even to mention the numerous bugs I encountered already) that make this game a ""no"" for me:The fighting is super boring; most of the time I just sit there with my turrents firing automatically and I don't do anything other than watch. Ships feel very small and their speed and maneuverability do not seem to decrease with size as far as I can tell (there is no ""speed"" property you could check when buying a ship). There is no good fast travel: gates are too expensive, wormholes regularly throw you out at the wrong location (and what is it with that terrible, terrible animation you are shown after you have flown into a wormhole?) and those ""green highways"" seem a bit pointless; most importantly while all of these move you long distances quickly they don't allow to quickly travel to something that is say halfway of that distance. Factions have no character and no individual story making them pointless really. The energy transfer management can only be used effectively by dragging it around with your mouse; there are no customizable settings to be activated through a button, e.g. a ""hit and run"" (50% engine, 50% weapons). Skills have no real impact: I have put all my skillpoints into one particular tree (beam weapons) and I still can't tell the difference before and after I activated the skill, with the promised increase in range definitely not working. The game cannot be played effectively with a joystick: some button commands cannot be changed (e.g. closing window, using skill, cycle through tabs in the store) while others simply are not recognized or don't work; also you can't use a mouse to quickly navigate say the store and star map.There are many more things that have added to me not liking this game, but those are probably too specific to me to be really useful for other players.Tl;DR: Repetive missions, bad main story, boring fights, lots of mindless grinding, terrible voice acting, the whole universe feels characterless and the joysticks can't be used effectively. While it is trying to combine the best things of previously succesful spacesims (freelance, x3) it does not get it right.			"

												So I thought I’d wait before writing this review until I got at least 10h+ gameplay and finished the “story”. So at the time I’m writing this I got 43h+, and just finished the game. My favorite space game of all time is probably Freelancer, and other games I’ve tried haven’t even come close to it. But when I heard about Starpoint Gemini 2 I got my hopes up a little. Started following the game, checked in-game videos and such, and I got very interested. So I decied to buy it a week before the release cause it was on sale. It’s a good game. If you, like me enjoyed freelancer then you will no doubt enjoy this aswell. It’s not as good,  but it’s definitely not a bad game. The RPG elements are an interesting addition to the game. You start of by choosing your “class” which are:  Commander, Gunner and Engineer all with different set of skills. Depending on your play style if you prefer being in a small group of ships or just pure loner/dogfighter etc, I think most players will find these classes interesting.Alright, now to the positive and negative aspects of the game: I really liked the “feel” of the ships, smaller ships are easier to maneuver while the bigger ones are heavier, and I like that “feeling” it really does feel like you are flying a ship. So the developers got that down quite well, spot on. I do wish they would have added like a secret ship(s) that could only be found and bought at a specific place that was hidden.   And continuing on the topic of ships, there are A LOT of them to buy. Allthough you will be very discouraged with the prices in the beginning, but don’t worry cash will eventually start flowing in. Just do side missions or if you prefer mining or trading etc. The map is huge, and you have a lot of exploring to do if you’re into that. Just wish there were more things to explore, more secrets and mysterious anomalies etc. There isn’t really any suprises or “wtf” moments in this game, which is sad. No mystery. The graphics are awesome, no complaints here it’s a living world and the designs are nice. The sounds and music are awesome. But…I really wish they would use at least more than just ONE battle tune, cause it gets reaaally tiring to be hearing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. Specially since battle is a big part of the game. Would it have hurt to put in at least 2 more songs in? Other than that the rest of the songs are awesome, it really suits the mood and game.There are also enemy heroes in this game, which all have bounties on them. And they give you a lot of cash, I totally missed this feature when I started playing so it took forever for me to get cash in the beginning. So that’s a nice feature, but would have been even more interesting if they had like one final hero that was nearly impossible to beat, unless you were leveled up to the max with the best ship etc. Now to some of the negative aspects of the game: Map travel, when you press M or whatever button to bring up the map, the game pauses…so while you check your map and try to plan ahead for your future travels, the game is on pause and you don’t progress at all. So while I was travelling to this planet, and checking the map at the same time I noticed I was right where I left of. So that’s annoying.The autopilot fails a lot of the times. It only does this after you have docked with a starbase and you click on your next destination to go there autopilot, most of the times it just freaks out and takes you in circles.The voice acting in this game is a big joke. And not in a good way either, cause sometimes bad voice acting can at least make you laugh, but this was just…ugh.The storyline is nonexistent. Which is really sad cause of the big universe the developers built up they could have written such a better story for this game. So if you buy this thinking it will have a nice or at least mediocre story, rethink why you want this game. Im not saying not to buy it, beacuse the good things outweighs the bad in this game. So to end this I’d say it probably is the best new single player space game out right now.I’d give this game a 7/10+Many ships to buy+Huge map, a lot to explore+Pretty graphics+Music+Enemy Heroes+RPG elements-Maptravel-Music-Bad voice acting-♥♥♥♥ story-Autopilot fails			"

												I have mixed feelings for this game. I wish I could make the review neutral. It's a space sandbox where you roam Gemini system, complete easy single objective quests, get money and buy better ships and guns. The game is quite slow-paced, and you'll probably want an open book at your table, so you can read it while your ship travels to whatever waypoint you've set. The combat system is pretty simple, devs probably wanted this game to be chilling instead of intense. Positive moments:- Beautiful space vistas and ships.- You can destroy enemies, you can mine asteroids, you can buy things in one place to sell in another. It's a sandbox.- A free DLC with alternative campaign from the first game.Negative moments:- The story is mediochre, we've seen all this a thousand times before.- Voice acting in campaign is pretty bad.- My PC fits the requirements, and yet the performance is really bad. I experienced crashes in long sessions too.- Once you get yourself a carrier class vessel, you'll find out that there's like nothing else to do. You can bother yourself with achievements, but it isn't that fun.- Unrealistic game world. Nebulas within a solar system, asteroids gathered in clouds rather than in rings, tiny planets and stars, you only fly forward when your engines are on: your ship stops once you turned them off, like a car would. I understand that it all was done to make the game less boring and more saturated with content, but it fells just toyish.Starpoint Gemini 2 is still fun to play, even with the flaws I listed, but I can't recommend it for the full price. If you're into space, get it when on sale.			"

												When I was a young adult (28) I bought an Amstrad CPC 8-bit computer and a cassette with the game ""Elite"" on it. I played that religiously at least a year and after that again every now and then. The graphics were underwhelming (green wire graphic), the plot practically non-existent. There were only 8 ""missions"" I knew of and the grind to get to Elite level was enormous.I looked for such a game a long time after that. Freelancer was a good try. The direct Elite successors were overdone and technically underwhelming. After a while I gave up.Then I stumbled over SPG2. And here it is again. Nearly. The freedom to do what I want, the grind to get to the top and a vast universe. For such a game it is important that the combat is interesting, and it is. If you are level 20+ you will encounter more than one enemy at a time, and then you will have your hands full.Here a pro and con list:+ Graphics are good. Not brillant, but good.+ You are free! You may do what you want. You can safely ignore the main quest if you want.+ You can capture ships. That is not only very profitable but also fun and later on you have to be quite skillful to pull that off (with battleships and the like).+ The map is huge.+ Fighting feels great.+ Your character has levels, perks and skills. And they are surprisingly useful (I play an engineer). And fun.+ You have to learn the UI but after the initial learning process it is very functional.+ You can change all keys. And you should change at least some.+ There is a nice levelling curve. It could be even slower, to be honest...+ There are secrets in the game. A secret station I just discovered (named after an astronomer, won't spoil it too much), sectors with radioactivity, anomalies and so on.+ If you don't know what to do you can do an automatically generated mission. They are endless.+ You can save only on a station. I like that because it means you risk a bit if you venture outside. But only a bit. Just the right amount :)+ The developers are very active and really trying to please their customers.- Trading is not risk free (there are enemies out there) and not profitable. That is not well designed because either you avoid risk and gain or take risks and get profit, but the trading option means that you take the worst from both worlds.- While there is a reputation system it is not individual to each of the factions. You are evil or good (or something in between). If you are ""good"" you are liked by all lawful factions. If you are evil you are liked by all evil factions. That could be more individualized.- The main quest has quite a boring plot and is not written very well. The voiceovers are horrible. These accents!- The map is not endless. That is not a big disadvantage because it is huge as it is. But it would be nice to have an option to generate a new ""universe"" procedurally.- If you land at a station the graphics are disappointing. It is nothing more than a greyed-out picture of you in front of the station. You don't feel you are on the station, you feel you are in a system menu.- The full screen mode does not work every time. On Windows 8.1, NVidia 760, full screen mode is only achieved after I start the game the second time. That is a bit unprofessional...Graphics: 8/10Gameplay: 9/10Developers: 10/10Main Quest: 3/10Combat: 9/10Feeling of Progress: 9/10Overall: 9/10Good: if you like Elite or Freelancer.Not that good: if you like X, X2, X3.I bought it in a sale but it is worth its normal price and then some.

												Highly recommended! This game is similar to so many other games, yet so different in every aspect. These guys really offered something special.And if you have a question, devs are answering them on Steam forums 24/7. Something that is rarely seen. My boyfriend got me this game cause I liked Evochron Mercenary. I'm as happy as I can be with it. Highly addictive and fun!Thumbs up!Update: After so many hours, I still feel compelled to return to the game from time to time. I left my heart in Gemini, it would seem. :)			"

												I'm 60+ hours into the game as I write this review. I have to say that I haven't played space sims for a while but do have fond memories of Freespace 2, Wing Commander, Privateer, Freelancer and Darkstar 1. The good news is that SG2 has some interesting elements. Could it be better? Sure, but let's get to the nitty-gritty. There are 3 things I'll comment on: RPG elements, SIM elements, and GAMEPLAY elements.RPG:·	Not great -- voice acting is poor, and I don't really care much about the storylines (I have Origins, Aethera and Titans DLCs), which I feel could be better or more compelling.·	Not enough random events by NPCs, etc. The universe is constantly changing economically, politically but it doesn't feel ALIVE. The characters seem dead.·	There is a points/perk system where you can improve your character but that's about it.·	You get some credits and blueprints for completing campaign missions (no medals or other perks). The blueprint reward system is interesting but really tough to complete a whole set, so what's the point, really? ·	The NPCs you deal with are flat and uninteresting. Oh and the voice acting sucks. Or did I mention that already?SIM:·	This is supposed to be a space sim, but many controls are lacking. e.g. You can't coordinate attacks with wingmen or give them specific orders.·	Other sims even let you contact NPCs/wingmen over comms; not here.·	Combat is simplified -- which may or may not be a good thing. i.e. You have an auto-fire button for your light weapons, and a key for your heavy weapon. You have to be facing your opponent appropriately before other non-frontal weapons will fire. Sometimes the AI fires at other targets even when you're locked on the nearest one.·	There doesn't seem to be full support for my Thrustmaster -- I can't map the buttons, nor does it allow me to use a Joystick / keyboard combo. There is a turret cam view that can be useful, but without my joystick, it's pretty pointless.GAMEPLAY:·	Pretty graphics·	Fun sandbox (free play) mode. I actually spent more time here than on the campaigns.·	These are cool: Space stations, T-gates, T-drive travel, worm hole travel, boarding ships,          officers and mercs you can hire·	Lots to explore·	Faction/reputation tracking system·	Very useful star map with overlays and filters·	Game seems skewed towards battle; i.e. hard to get rich through the economic modelOverall:The game world is pretty. While the devs try to create a decent economic model, I'm not quite sure it succeeds. You can't really make much cash that way. The quickest way is to board and capture ships with your troopers, then sell the vessel, or through bounty-hunting. This skews the game towards a combat model -- not complaining, mind you, but if you want to have a robust economic model, well, then make it workable. Players should be able to make MORE money through mining, gas clouds, and trading. There's a fair bit of grinding involved if you want to play a merchant. This is a shame because there is an excellent transport infrastructure -- i.e. you can travel vast distances using T-gates, rifts, worm holes, etc.I like the fact that there's sandbox mode and campaign mode. Having hangars and your own fighters/bombers is a nice touch; and being able to beam your troopers to enemy vessels to try capturing them is fun. All in all, SG2 is an entertaining and pretty game, but it falls short of being great -- more RPG elements would help, and of course, proper joystick support... and yeah, the voice acting sucks! I would recommend getting it only if it's on sale. 6.5/10.0			"

												At a glance Starpoint Gemeni 2 is a sandbox space sim, nothing special and it has been done better before.I could live with it if the game features an interesting story, which the game does. The game also has a tendency to crash during or shortly after finishing a story mission which makes it a race to reach a save point before the game crashes and you need to redo the mission. So the redemption from story doesn't apply. If anything it just makes me more frustrated.Looking further into the game, you realize it is a single player MMORPG, ship upgrades are gated behind arbitrary level requirements. Ships handle basically the same except for the top speed, so your carrier is just as agile as the starting gunship.Weapon upgrades follow a similar MMORPG route, some weapons are poor and you go through the game trying to find better weapons. Weapons that are described in awkward and sometimes even incorrect ways, such as ""rate of fire"" being the delay between each shot. Once you get over the initial hump of how weapons operate you realize you need a calculator to figure out which weapon to use.Sure I can play this, but all the time doing so there is a thought in my head asking why I am playing this game when I have better games available.Edit: 2015-11-25I just wanted to add that this game isn't necessarily bad, if they fixed the weapon descriptions and the crashes I'd actually consider recommend it.I consider the X-series, especially X-3, to be more enjoyable. I do not want to advertise for other games in a review, which is why this was at first omnitted, but since so many replies have been about it I'll add it.			"

												This game will give you hours of fun, not a fast pace action packed in your face game but the strategic plan your every move with every action having consequences game. In saying that the combat is very rewarding with many battles containing the fast pace action (if you manuver your ship properly to avoid incoming damage and allow your weapons to target correctly while adjusting speed, shields and/or gunnery). Interface gets the job done but can take a few minutes to understand which isn't a negative with a great tutorial that can be accessed at any time if you forget something. There are not many camera angles which I look forward to an update on this to make a more fluid experience especially in combat (there is free move camera angle which can hinder while flying and looking around). I truly would enjoy a cockpit view from the captains chair to feel really immersed while mining or ship to ship combat. I also want to see more interactivity with planets and stations ( one suggestion would be allowing the player to approach an enemy planet to try a diplomatic or subversion mission to change the flow of power/status of that planet).  In a nutshell try this game it makes for a great space flying simulator.			"

												I see a lot of negative reviews for this game, and while it may be a bit repetative, I can't find any 3-D space RPGs that are as easy to control and not just pure spaceflight ""simulator"". The story and voice-overs are what you would expect from a space rpg, however that shouldn't really be the reason you play this game. In my opinion, I have had loads of fun warping all over the galaxy doing manuevers around large carries and owning pirates and rebels with my plasma cannons and missiles. The amount of customizibility with your ship is off the chart for this game, however once you find your playing style and the best gear for that style you are kind of set. You can also download other peoples mods and get fan made ships or docking hangers and other cool weapons not found in-game which is pretty sweet that the devs opened it up for modding.All in all, this is a quality game that I went back and purchased the DLC's for because I thought the price justified the entertainment. If you like space games like the original escape velocity, or games like the app galaxy on fire you will like this game a lot. 8/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 recently left Early Access, and it is now one of the few games of that honour to actually turn out well. If I was to compare it to anything, I'd say it's like Freelancer or an offline EVE, though not quite as complex as the latter. Complete sandbox freedom. Go wherever you want and be whatever you want, whether that be a trader, pirate, mercenary, miner, fighter, explorer etc. Though it is a space sim, it also plays a lot like an open world RPG. You pick from three different classes - COMMANDER: has a focus on buffing friendly units, GUNNER: all about maximising firepower and ENGINEER:  boosting your own power systems and hacking/debuffing the enemy - and go around doing freelance missions, mining, fighting or exploring, and it all gives you XP (and sometimes money) to level up your character. Levelling gives you the ability to spend points on improving your class skills, which can be used in battle, and attaining perks, which provide buffs to a number of things like increasing troop strength for boarding ships or improving trade prices.Besides the sandbox 'Freeroam' mode where you are able to freely explore, there is also a recently added Campaign mode. This provides you with story missions, but you lose the ability to pick your class, character portrait or choose from one of the three starter ships (it forces you into a Taurus ship, arguably the best of the three anyway). The story isn't great, and it's a little buggy, but you can still freely explore and do whatever you want while doing it. The story missions are not particularly interesting (go from point A to B, kill target, deliver package, meet NPC etc), but they give you something else to do. If you're feeling aimless and not sure what to do next, the campaign missions can be a good way to provide yourself with a sort of goal or objective. Each mission will advance in level and difficulty, and you will often find yourself needing to gain XP and a more powerful ship in order to advance. I found that It added to the feeling of progression, albeit in a not very interesting way. It's completely optional, but I personally had no interest in it.There are nearly a hundred ships to acquire by either buying them or grappling and boarding an enemy ship, killing the crew and towing it back to a nearby station to either sell ( for a very high price ;] ) or place in your garage for use, and they are all customisable. You can equip them with a variety of different weapons like railguns, plasma cannons, beam weapons and heavy weapons. You can enhance your systems by purchasing upgrades for things like your propulsion engines or shield generators. You can even give them a new paint job and add decals, though the colours don't stand out too well and the decals are just a short list of basic emblems. You do have the ability to add your own custom ones, but I didn't mess around with that feature. They're nice cosmetic touches, but nothing to rave about. The boarding is also fully automated and you don't actually get to see anything happening. It's nothing more than watching troop numbers rise and fall and choosing whether or not to send reinforcements. Quite unexciting to say the least, but stealing ships this way will be your main source of income, and managing to capture an expensive ship still gave me a lovely feeling of satisfaction despite the lack of a more involved system.Your ship is freely controlled, you can fly it yourself wherever you wish with the WASD keys and your mouse. You also must manage your power output. Do you divert all power to engines to give yourself a speed boost, to shields to make them hold out longer, to weapons so they fire for longer or do you try to balance between them all? It's very situational and you will find yourself having to tweak it back and forth very often when travelling and in combat. It's a system I quite enjoy as it keeps you occupied and helps with keeping the combat and travel feeling busy.Speaking of combat, it's very fun, though not too complex. You can aim and fire your weapons yourself or have it done for you with autofire (though it can be inaccurate at times) and positioning is key. You and your enemy have four directional shields, one for each side, and each decreases under fire accordingly, meaning you should focus fire on one side if you wish to do optimal damage. If any of you have played Star Trek Online, the shielding is pretty similar to what that game has. You also have a choice of four skills, which differ depending on your choice of class. Each provides some sort of combat buff and can be levelled to add more effects. On top of that, there are then a multitude of items you can purchase and use whenever you wish, such as temporary speed boosters, repair drones or T-Drives (these allow you to instantaneously jump great distances) and a variety of other things. If used right, they can really save you when in a tight spot.One issue with the combat however, is balance. I often found myself easily destroying ships marked as 'impossible' targets to beat due to having bought a reasonably expensive weapon or by managing to acquire a powerful ship. This can really mess with the early game and make it far too easy. It does begin to even out the further you level due to enemy scaling, but as long as you continue upgrading, it never gets difficult enough. This is tricky to do however and really only becomes a problem once you're comfortable and good at the game, which takes time.Overall, and despite some flaws, I believe this to be a good game with a lot of love and care put into it by the devs. It is just oozing with content and interesting, well polished mechanics. If the developer's words are anything to go by, a huge list of future content is still planned for Starpoint Gemini 2 and all of it will, supposedly, be completely free of charge. Hopefully a game to keep your eye on.I highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of space sims, sandbox titles and even people who are awaiting Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen. It's not overly complex and it does lean a little more on the arcadey side of things, but despite that, it's still a deep enough experience to sink some enjoyable hours into.Score: 7/10			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a great space rpg.usually a statement like that needs clarification, so here we go. this game is basically if you took the most complicated parts out of games like x, opened up the game world like evochron mercenary and throw in a control system not unlike eve online. what im getting at is that its not as complicated to play as the aforementioned games but leaves the best parts of each and marries them into a system thats fresh and familiar.one of the things that irritated me about the x series and evochron for that matter is that missions had to be acquired at a station. my question has always been, why? no long range communications in either universe? in SPG2 that is a thing of the past, when you enter an area, you will be notified when missions are available and you can accept missions directly from the starmap which brings me to the next point. the starmap is one contigious area, like in evochron, there are no load screeens and while the actual area is smaller than evochron, its a lot more detailed visually. so yes its probably not 100% true to life because there are very few areas that just look like a black void in space, but the visuals are well done and give you more to look at than just black with white dots everywhere.controls are reminicent of eve online though i havent played it in years, it reminds me of that. not necessarily a terrible thing, but if you are looking to find yourself in the cockpit of the ship, these ships dont feature cockpits. if anything even the smallest class available would have a bridge. so in comparison to the ships in X or EM, youre piloting a capital ship right off the bat. in fact to give some comparison, the M5 through M3 classes of ships in X are basically bought as commodities to place in the hangar of carriers. you wont be flying anything that small and if you were, youd have reason to be very very afraid. it would seem that the gemini system doesnt build much of anything in small scale :)As of this writing there are a few technical issues that arent game breaking but considering the devlopment team is very active and even communicates with the players regularly i feel that this game will evolve into something even better. if you like rpgs and space games, this will be right up your alley. LGM has done a great job keeping the game fun and challenging without making it a nightmare to learn how to play.			"

												I wish there was a ""meh"" button along with thumbs up and thumbs down. Bought it after getting burned out on Elite Dangerous in hopes that it would scratch my space sim itch. One one hand, the scale just isn't there. You tool around a single smallish star system littered with stations, planets, teleportation gates and even a couple black holes and nebulae for some reason. The space is also dirty, dusty and littlered - no, really - there are chunks of rock and clouds of dust constantly whizzing by (fortunately there are mods that get rid of that). There's no hyperspacing to other systems or exploring the galaxy. I guess it's a little bit like the Expanse TV series.On the oher hand, during ship combat the scale is pretty faithful - you blast your cannons in the general direction of someone flying around you in the darkness, and all you see of the opposing ship is the big red target marker. Eventually, one of you blows up. The only way to take a closer look is to approach to boarding distance, which I have to admit is a nice touch. Between that and a rather obtuse camera, the space combat experience is underwhelming.The game isn't bad, it's just kind of lackluster. You can tell that it was made by a tiny studio on a limited budget. I know LGM tried hard, but neither the visuals nor the sound can hold a candle to the current-gen games. After seeing the visuals delivered by Elite and even the unfinished mess that is Star Citizen, you soon notice the janky-looking engine exhaust, low-budget pewpew effects and simplistic ships.It also has some issues outside of the weird camera, the most glaring being a graphics crash (blank screen) in full-screen mode. Since you can only save in stations, this can wipe out a lot of progress.Let me put it this way: this is a chill spaceflight game (not a sim) in the similar vein as Rogue Galaxy, and it was worth the purchase price of $6.50 with all DLCs during the sale. I wouldn't pay more than that.			"

								SPG2 is a great game. It's in another league compared to the original. The graphics are spot on, and for an alpha game, it has the signs of being a classic.More importantly, it has a great  community. The devs are always around and quick to answer any questions, and they actually listen and support their player base. This is what gaming is missing these days from the ""AAA"" developers. If you enjoy RPG games, and space games, this is the perfect RPG space game.			"

												Starpoint Gemini feels like a PC game I played when I was younger. It's relatively rough around the edges and there is nothing groundbreaking about the graphics--but it represents a kind of space exploration game in a very cohesive package. The soundtrack is filled with ambient electronica and is a real highlight for me; scanning pulsars and exploring unknown reaches of space feels extremely gratifying and peaceful at the same time.The game itself lets you explore space however you choose: you can become a merchant flying cargo through sectors, a bounty hunter going after pirates, an explorer of the universe and scanning anomalies and space oddities etc, etc. It's a game with great potential that doesn't hold you hand from start to finish. If you have any interest in Sci-fi/space exploration games (Freelancer/Star Trek: Bridge Commander/Eve Online) this game does a great job filling that role.			"

												Starpoing Gemini 2 is a humbling game.  It isn't on the scale of some star exploration games, being in only one star system.  But where it lacks in size to its competition, it makes up for it with sheer density and diversity in play.  You can be a star trader, pirate, a security operative, or... yes, even a mere space station mechanic -- only accepting missions to repair other space stations to earn your money.  The combat is intelligent and engaging, but not too challenging.  The only drawback is I cannot bring my friends in.  But with a list of objectives like I have in this, who has time for them?  time to go kill some pirates and steal whatever they've stolen, and sell it!  BETTER SHIPS ♥♥♥♥♥ES "

												I would not recommend this game to anyone but the most hardcore fans of the genre, and that provided the price comes down. While I do acknowledge some might enjoy the tedium and vaccum, neither I, nor any of my friends did. Core mechanics are grind, fetch&kill 'quests' and exploration. You also pick up things and sell them off at the nearest friendly station, or buy things at one point and sell them to a trader across the map for profit. The game world is huge and fun to explore at first, but given the lack of variety (it is space, after all) it will get boring afer a while. Combat is nothing like a proper space sim - you either get projectile weapons and miss, or directed energy (beam) weapons and hit 100% of the time via automatic turrets. These make the whole combat thing ridiculous - all the fun is outsourced to your onboard computer. The game seems to be balanced with this in mind - you can either turn on the auto tracking and let the computer do the fighting or die. Fun parts:-exploration. the playing environment is huge! Volumetric shadows, nebulas, asteroid and debris fields and planets are stunning. It does get old after a while given the game's shortcomings -visuals as per above. Nothing you haven't seen in X3 already though-ship designs & varietyThe not-so-fun parts:-tedious, fetch&kill tasks that pass for quests here; gets old in about 10 minutes -the game is vacuous. think mmo without quests or other players. -as of now the game is bugged and some options are greyed out. No, despite what the industry standard for indie games seems to have become lately, it is not okay to release an unfinished game with greyed out options and scenarios that 'will be added later on'. That's what early access is for!-repetitive, unaccomplished space combat-the 'RPG' portion of the game comes down to several global stat boosts and 4 active skills, which I've not seen to have any serious impact on the game			"

												I am a SUCKER for space exploration games (I even played Darkstar One, and it was mediocre at best). An yet I did not like this one. This has mainly three reasons:* The story (what little I have played before giving up on the game) is not riveting and seems to follow already trodden paths (trodden by games far superior). The whole ""The system is riven with conflict and there is some hidden threat only YOU can uncover"" is nice and dandy, but again, done better by previous games. The voice acting is .. unethusiastic. I know, I have been spoiled by world-class actin as in Mass Effect, but still...There is a lot of grinding - trading, mining, doing freelance missions, to get a ship that you need to NOT be blasted to smithereens by the next main mission,. There ALWAYS is. It is a core principle of the game, and usually, one that I like. In this game, it feels like a chore. This has again to do with the story, which just does nothing to make me want to reach the next mission.* The steering. This is a MAYOR point. I did not think one could botch follow-the-mouse-steering. Sadly, one can. The point you fly to is somewhere in the upper third of the monitor. Which KINDA makes sense given the perspective and the axis of the ship and all. BUT the neutral zone of the mouse-steering is in the center of the screen. Which means that when you point at an object an try to fly towards it, you will pass OVER it (for given values of ""OVER"" in 3D space).This is annoying, to say the least. It is also unintuitive. I remember when Freelancer made me use the mouse (for me, it was the first time then) to steer the ship. I took to it in seconds, because it was so intuitive. Well, this one is NOT.* The mission system is bugged, if not broken. ""Yes, you can take this mission with level 6"" Great. They WHY is there a friggin' CRUISER waiting for my gunship at the mission point, blasting the living hell out of me? This happens regularly, and it is annoying. ""Nooo, THIS science mission is WAY to dangerous, it requires you to be level 11."" Ah-ha. So floating in space, with NO enemies to pop up (I have yet to meet one on science missions) and waiting for the scanner is something only my higher-level self can handle.. All those points make me kinda regret the purchase. Oh, and one final note: it may be okay with copyright law to use the theme from the mining minigame of Mass Effect 2 and use in the score, for me, it was just an INSULT to the ME franchise, because this game is not even doing the same sport, not not mention playing in the same league.

												A worthy addition to your steam space strategy titles. It starts off a little grindy but once you get over the initial credit problems the fun really begins. Over 70 ships to buy and fly from gunships all the way up to carriers and dreadnoughts. You can trade and fight across a large area with many many different factions.Customize your ship how you like with different officers, weapons and equipment and choose from a large amount of skills and perks to further compliment your ship.There are two modes to play, campaign for a single player story and sandbox. The effort has obviously been put into the sandbox over the campaign.One really annoying problem and probably the only major one for me is the abyssmal camera control. Something that should be bread and butter for a game of this type. you have to use something called turret mode to get anywhere near the type of camera your used to in just about every other game of this type. Unfortunately even turret mode is a floodlight type chase cam.Despite the camera problem I heartily recommend this game for anyone who is missing a fix of space goodness.Here is a taste of cruiser gameplay:

												Very good Freelancer-like spaceships game. Very nice graphics, playability and effects. A lot of ships which are actually different one from one to another. There's not just the boring small-big-bigger-huge mechanics mixed with the Light-Heavy-Trader axis. With different stats (cargo load, soldiers, weapon spots etc) the choice between one model and the other seems to have some meaning. Trading is a bit basic, although the map is very large and there are a lot different goods with different degrees of ""rareness"". Main campaign not so exciting but with some twists and cutplay more than decent. Big plus: the company is still supporting the game with fixes, adds and patches. Without asking you for more money.

												It took nearly 20 hours to finally come to a conclusion on this game.Despite all efforts made to make the combat complex - energy management, 4 different active abilities (with a kinda silly feeling levelups with them),  and up to 4 consumable items (of a selection of around a dozen) useful for combat - it just isn't all that fun. I believe the biggest culprit is turrets. While it is possible to partially blindside a less maneuverable ship than yours in 1v1, ultimately maneuvering and dodging in combat is best done by spinning around in circles. When you're spinning around in circles, you can't effectively target and attack targets manually, and so you rely on fire-at-will auto targetting to do that job for you. This is boring.The economy is workable, but not that interesting - different stations have a set low-mid-high value for all of the commodities. Buy and sell appropriately.The storyline is workable. The Gemini universe is interesting, and is worth reading about if you're into that sort of thing. The storyline does an almost adequate job of immersing you in that universe. The voice acting/writing is awwwwwwful.The good: All around, this is a workable game that will scratch your spacefaring itch, though will likely not leave you satisfied. The graphics are beautiful, each region of space is very well stylized in the coloring, asteroids, and various anomalies. Plenty of the starbases and ships have pretty unique detailed models. Music and sound are good, although the short soundtrack for the music is a mild disappointment there.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a complete turn-around from the quality of the first game. It's prettier, it's satisfyingly complex and most of all, it's a lot of fun. It's blend of RPG elements, freeroaming gameplay and atmosphere is great, and pretty well refined. While the voice acting isn't anything to write home about, the simple joy of adjusting the loadout for your ships, hiring officers, mercs and troopers, and leveling up can be downright intoxicating. A couple small issues nag at me, however. At the time of this review, the ability to adjust shadow quality or post-processing in the video options menu is still locked. There are some balancing issues that make themselves painfully apparent within the first hour or so of gameplay, namely the rate at which you accrue money. Tackling big number bounties might seem like a great idea, but they're prohibitively difficult (as of level 7, all the available bounties were way way out of my level range) and grinding freelance missions can sometimes feel monotonous. Additionally, the lack of communications chatter between ships can make space feel somewhat sterile. When rescuing a ship from pirates, it would be great to hear a panicked captain's voice pleading for assistance, or thanking me for the help. These are minor gripes about what amounts to an overall great experience.Granted, I haven't played through a ton of the story campaign content, and my time with the game might be small compared to others, but having seen such a triumphant turn-around from the first entry, I felt compelled to gush a little bit, and congratulate the developers. Well done, guys! I tend to not be one to jump on the early access titles very often, but it was honestly really cool watching the development of this game, seeing community input being utilized, and watching something grow from nothing. I can say truthfully that I don't regret purchasing this game during early access in the least.4 out of 5 stars.			"

												I love space sim, Freelancer, Freespace, etc. and I hoped for this game to be another like them. But unfortunately no. Graphis is good, ships nice, weapons too. But..Why have only turrets? And camera binded to them?Why such dumb camera controls? Even with joystick it's not like space sim.Why so slow travelling without time acceleration?I've tried it for a few hours, but no, I am dissapointed, I was looking forward to this game. Maybe I will try to play it another year if those issues would be solved.			"

								Fun game.  Beta is smooth and enjoyable.  I hope for more depth of play in storyline missions and random missions.  I hope for a HUD feature that shows stats on targets even when they aren't in front of you ""on-screen"".  Good for a beta.  4/5.			"

												With only 3 hours play this is only first thoughts.A worthy title. If you have played any of the X series of games this is it's younger and not so complicated brother. In some ways it is more like Freelancer but either way it has nods to all these games whilst keeping it light on the learning curve. You can jump right in and start blasting asteroids for early bucks and the early missions (freeplay) are doable with the starting ship.I have several mods that give me Star Trek ships and a Star Wars universe to roam in which are both from the Steam Workshop.In short (in earlry play) this is an instantly playable space trading/shooter that looks and feels great but don't expect the depth that the X series has (which for some people will be perfect ;) )7/10 Go give an asteroid a new bumhole.

												This game was a big surprise for me. I was never much into heavy stuff like Star Citizen with their real physics and hardcore gaming. SPG2 is fun, entertaining, tense, interesting, relaxing, I cannot describe it in a few words. I found this by accident and decided to give it a try. It blew me away. Please, give it a shot. I doubt you'll regret it. Can't wait to see what will they come up with next! 11 out of 10!Update Jun 2016. Seeing and playing Warlords, you can tell how deeply these devs care about their players. Warlords is so much bigger and with so many stuff people wanted in SPG2, that I can recommend it over SPG2. But if you're relatively new to the genre, this gem is currently on massive 80% off and it's worth every cent.			"

Early Access Review
								Overall, it's a very, very good game. I've split this review into a few categories, so maybe that'll help you find what matters most.- GameplayLet's be honest here. This game is about space combat, not about mining or scavenging or being a space taxi man. That's where the ""meat and potatoes"" of this game is. So this is the most important thing for this game to get right. If it fails at this, it fails as a game.And to its credit... gameplay is superb. Combat is fun, if a bit monotonous once you get a really powerful ship. It only keeps you on the edge of your seat when you're in real danger of losing your ship, such as when facing a really strong enemy while you're flying a much weaker ship, or a large fleet of enemies on your own.Capturing an enemy ship is very satisfying. Unfortunately, towing ships takes a very long time and can be quite boring, especially if you're being attacked by enemies the whole way there. This game is still in early access, so balancing will still happen, so we'll have to see where it goes. But for now, its an amazing game and I can't wait for more!There are a few immersion-breaking issues, though, such as the large delay, stutters and pauses when starting up the game, when entering a new area, when receiving new missions, or when auto-saving. However, since this is early access and not full release, we'll have to see what will become of these bugs.Score: 9/10- StorylineNone. At least none that I could find. While the game is tremendous fun on its own, with farming resources, capturing enemy ships and destroying enemy outposts, there doesn't seem to be any real purpose to it. At least not until the game is finished.The story is still being developed, as this is still an unfinished product. But if this turns out to be a game where the war between factions can have the tide of the war turned either way depending on the player's success or failure in certain missions, it could be very cool, especially if areas become owned by different factions thereafter.Score: Unknown (Not yet finished)- ControlsThe controls are nice and solid, with ships feeling very responsive (small ones) or sluggish (large ones) depending on size. The way a ship accelerates and breaks is also much more believable and immersive than you might believe from early footage. Trying to get a carrier to stop within 100m of a target feels like a feat of piloting at times.3D space combat has been perfect by this game. I've played many space combat games like Homeworld, Star Trek Online and several others. But this game nails it and then some. At first I didn't understand why all the buttons and controls were needed for. But after enough time playing, I get it. And the position of the keys and what they do really helps give you a great feeling of control in the game.Score: 10/10- Graphics and SoundLet's face it, as time marches forwards nobody wants to see ugly-looking games (unless they like Indie or retro games). And this game has some of the finest looking graphics one could hope for. They look beautiful, and even at 1440p on my GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB it still performs smoothly (except when there are a lot of ships).Considering that this is on the low side of a mid-tier graphics card, I'm impressed. With more graphics settings I should be able to increase framerate, and coding optimizations should also help make the game run smoother in the long term.Sound wasn't much of a focus on this game, but the chatter and computer voice are really nice, and remind me a lot of the voice of the Enterprise-D in Star Trek: The Next Generation. It was a heart-warming surprise, and I can't wait until we get a total conversion mod for Starpoint Gemini 2.The lack of a large variety of background music did feel a bit annoying and lackluster, but time will fix that. I'd love to have this game include beautiful symphonic and orchestral music, like Star Wars, Star Trek, and other great SciFi series. Music could really help take this game to the next level.Score: 7/10- ChallengeThe game felt off-balance at several points during my dozens of hours playing so far. Capturing a large ship early on and using it felt almost like cheating on Normal difficulty. I'd like to see more balancing, such as not being able to use more than X amount of turrets on a ship depending on how many ranks below its minimum requirement you are. (So, if you're level 25 and trying to use a level 35 ship, you wouldn't be able to use 2 turrets in each direction.)The long-term replay-ability right now is hindered because the game hasn't really given players much of an end-game challenge or reward system. Once you have earned 50M credits, and have several Dreadnoughts in your garage, the game just doesn't feel challenging anymore.I'd like to see something to give the players the ability to hire commanders and bridge officers to command the ships in their garage, to they can join the player in large scale battles. This way it helps the player build his very own Armada to wipe out large (and challenging) enemy structures.Right now all the fun is at the first 30 levels of the game. Once you reach that, it gets monotonous. But given the early development of this game, I think we can expect great things from it, especially with modding support.Score: 6/10- FunWhat can I say? I had a blast (no pun intended)! It was exciting and challenging for a long while, and it's consumed me for the past few days. I've lost sleep planning what my next ship upgrade should be, or where to lurk around under cloak waiting to capture the ship I wanted (but couldn't afford). Few games drag you in and hold your attention like that. All I can say is that I'm beyond impressed!Score: 9/10- ConclusionI guess here's what I've got to say. For a game on Early Access on Steam, this is as much promise as I could dream of. (Unless you count Star Citizen, but that isn't fair.) It's fun, exciting, supports modding... it just isn't finished.If you're looking to buy a whole package that's neatly wrapped up, ready to go, this game isn't for you. When you play an Early Access game, you're getting a sneak preview, you're beta-testing a game that will (of course) be filled with bugs (and your job is to report them), and your feedback this early on will also help shape where the game goes. You get to be involved in the creation of the game, and if it succeeds you get the satisfaction of knowing you helped a little.This is a sneak preview. It's a taste of what's to come. And so far, I like what I see. They've got the game where it counts. Now it's just a matter of the final touches like faction warfare, dynamic economy, trade blockade, storyline, and so on. But given how far this game has progressed, that shouldn't take too much longer. I haven't seen many bugs, and for 25$ right now this game is a steal!I give this game a wholehearted approval, and my recommendation to buy it. I can't wait to see what kind of amazing mods we'll see. Here's hoping the team that did the Star Trek Armada III mod for Sins of a Solar Empire can start working ASAP on Starpoint Gemini 2.			"

												Overall, I think this is a pretty fun game...just not worth the $40 they want for the game + DLC.  Given that it's been released for several years now, and apparently, is still full of bugs/missing mechanics that the dev's were promising would be fixed years ago, I don't think I'll be buying anything else by this company.  The Titan DLC was rather dissapointing, it was more of a God mode than additional content...once you're in a Titan, just hit fire at will, and a few seconds later, even fleets of carriers are goners...and there's only 2 enemy titans as opponents, once you've captured/destroyed them, you're pretty much invincible. Also, voiceovers frequently failed, the game would occasionally crash for no apparent reason, and planets/bases only stocking 1-3 of consumables is frankly annoying and ridiculous, particularly when it comes to those used for salvaging/mining.One thing I found particularly annoying, is that on the context menu, there is a button labled Follow.  None of the in-game tutorials mention this button, and as far I can tell, it remains greyed out no matter what you have selected...and does not work to let you follow any of your escort targets, or enemies, or anything else.  Nor does it work to tell hired mercs to ""follow"" you...apparently, it is one more vestige of over-ambitious devs that gave up on the game to move on to something else.I will mention that I have not tried any of the mods for the game, but as it stands by itself, it is definitely a product that did not live up to its potential....and the reputation system? Really? 1 kind of good vs. evil rep with all those factions? and if you go outlaw...its hilarious...once you can land on an outlaw planet, failing to smuggle on that planet moves your rep more towards outlaw(just like failing to smuggle on ""good"" planets), making outlaw factions(including that planet) more friendly...lol.I mean, how hard would it REALLY have been to include a reputation number for each faction?Don't get me wrong, I did find that game enjoyable overall...but there was so many constant things that made me feel like I was playing a beta instead of a game that had been released more than 3 years ago...

Early Access Review
								I had this game gifted to me by a friend(Thank you, Thune!), and it's easily one of the best space games I've played in awhile.  If you enjoyed the freedom that the X series gave you, but absolutely hated the UI(or lack there-of), this is a game to rectify that.Flying your ship is quite easy and fun, combat is rather fluid and in-line with the class of ship you're currently flying.  Combat is definitely part of the game, but certainly not the only aspect.  You can shoot asteroids for resources, scan anomalies, salvage wrecked vessels(of your own making via combat, or derelicts you find), send troops onto enemy ships in attempts to capture and then tow them to a station(strip them of fittings, sell them, or keep them for yourself), there's also trading between stations and planets.Everything you do awards some experience points(running missions, scanning anomalies, killing things, etc), which is then used to upgrade your character's abilities(weapon skills for railguns, lasers, plasma and heavy weapons; want your railgun shots to have a chance to fire twice with one volley?  A chance to penetrate shields and hit hull?  Longer bursts for your lasers?  Put points into the appropriate skills.)The devs are very active on the forums and always listen to the community, even adding community ideas into the game regularly.  They also really want the modding community to have as much control as possible to expand the game; as evidenced by the Steamworkshop support.I expect great things to be afoot for this game in the future, and even in early access it's fun to tinker around and see what you can get into.  The engine is solid and the dev team is very much hard at work, the community following the game is strong.I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open-world space games with no loading screens.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is not your ""typical"" Space Fighter game. When playing this game you need to treat your ships more as a ""crewed"" ship then a standard fighter ship. First mistake I made was trying to use my ship as a fighter, this reduced the amount of fire power and abilities of my ship greatly. Every ship in the game is a manned ship meaning turrets are controled by you or you can assign crew to operate them for you, leaving you the ability to keep them in line with the target. Its an extremely in depth game, and extremely fun. I'd highly recommend it to any one who is tired of the same old ""fighter craft in space"" game.			"

								I've been looking for a game like this for a long time. There are a lot of space games out there (and quite literally more coming by the day) but most focus on either small scale fighter combat (Freelancer / Freespace style), or large scale rts fleet combat (Sins of a Solar Empire / Home World). There isnt much of a selection when it comes to piloting your own larger class of ship from the helm. For those of you who enjoy the likes of Eve and Startrek Online i believe there will be much here you will enjoy. First impressions show a lot of potential and a fun RPG / progression system in place. The graphics are nice and the combat is enjoyable. I look forward to seeing more of what this game has to offer.			"

												Having just played through Rebel Galaxy, maybe I was expecting too much, but couldn't get into this.  It lacks cohesive vision, just feels like a bunch of different game systems tacked on, and thrown together, with nothing in particular being well done.  It's not terrible, just dull.  Combat is dull, trading is dull, the progression system is dull, weapon and ship variants, factions, characters, various ways of adding percentage bonuses to basic abilities, ship enhancement items, crew members you can hire, but nothing does anything interesting.  The story is barely more than a distraction.  The gameworld is just a bunch of planets and stations clumped together in a cubic space, with a binary star painted in the background, like the scenery behind a fishtank.  It's a space sim which seems to be created by people who have no interest in basic astronomy whatsoever.  Disappointing.			"

												As someone who loves space games, including strategy, simulation, sandbox, RPG, and almost any genre in space, I love this game.  Im an avid fan of X3: Terran Conflict and the X series in general.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has so many things right and is fun, simple, and rather elegant.  I highly recommend it.  However, as with all games, it does have drawbacks and a few not so great things. First off, Voice Acting-You will likely notice it straight away when you start the campaign.  The voice acting is certainly better than that in the original, however it is still poor.  Most characters have strange accents or inflections, strange pronunciations which are inconsitent between characters (specifically the word ""stasis"") and no emotional connection.  The main character, Adrian Faulkner, is basically monotone with no depth nor feeling thruout. As a man who just lost his father and is out for revenge, he is VERY boring.   So do not expect the story to be compelling on that count. Story/missions-The story in SPG2 is better that is was in the original, and seems more streamlined, however it still remains quite boring after a short while.  I understand the game is mostly freeroam/sandbox, so take this as you will.  However, the missions are a bit more diverse than the original with some capture stuff added in as well as some scanning and transporting.  But it still remains the standard ""Go Here, Kill/capture/scan/transport, Return, Listen to more dialogue""    So dont expect alot of diversity in missions.  Its pretty much the same with side missions and freelance. Gameplay-The gameplay is terrific. Its nice, simple, and easy to use.  Its easy to jump into the game and not have to learn 1000 controls or things to do.   However I personally miss some of the depth of controls and other minor things for the sake of immersion. (Thinking of X3) Ship models / aesthetic -The overall design, and texture of all ships and stations were fantastic and very intricate.  I might have to say they are some ofmy favorite ship designs in a long time.   Planets are ok, but lack proper scale.  Vigo at the start is almost the same size as planet trinity or at least pretty close.  Go look at planets in X3 and see proper scale.  However I understand such an accurate massive scale wouldnt work in an sandbox single system. Its something that many space games (mostly strategy games) do. In the end I would definitely recommend this if you are looking for a nice, simple space sim with a bit of RPG elements thrown in.  You will get a good 40 or so hours out of it, then will lack anything to do. There are freelance missions that will repeat forever.			"

No attemp to feel like your on a far away civilization. Took 1/2 hour to figure out how to land on the planet w/o blowing up and having to do the ENTIRE mission over. SPOILER ALERT: Space travel is very slow. But for $8 what the heck. Someday I'll have time to get as high as the designers and figure out this frustration fubar.It's just seems to be more frustrating than what it's worth. Wormholes where none are being displayed, supposed upgrades are just terrible downgrades. Losing interest real fast. You're told to ""Follow"" a ship, yet the ""Follow button in the HuD is grey'd out; no way to match speed of ship you're following... It'll take hundreds, if not a thousand missions to afford a ship, worthy of making this game fun. Excuse me while I gladly step out of this air-lock.			"

												A game that surpass expectations and delivers countless hours of fun and excitement to any space Sim fan.I came across Starpoint Gemini 2 when the lack of time made me stop playing X3 Terran conflict/AP. I'm a huge fan of X series but the amount of options you have are so vast that consequently increases the complexity of the game and therefore the time you have to invest to progress. Unfortunately with work and all, I just stopped playing those majestic games.SPG2 is not that complex and therefore its perfect if you want most features that a space Sim should offer but in a simple and easy way. You still have it all... Trading, Mining, Piracy, Boarding and countless more things to do, just way more accessible.Recommend 100% "

								I see some potential, but it is a bit of a letdown if you're expecting something like Freelancer. The visuals are nice and there are lots of options for cargo and things like that, but the whole place just feels desolate. There is no signs of life anywhere. I mean, you see ships, but they seem like drones. There is zero com chatter or anything resembling conversation. The only one who talks to you is your ship. You never see any people when docked on space stations or planets. That really brought Freelancer to life, where you could talk to people in the station bars and get tips. This place seems dead by comparison.			"

												Unfortunatly although the game has good reviews i found it mediocre to bad at some points. it has lousy ai (both pathfinding in space the ai keeps on bumping into stations or planets trying to go to the location you have picked) and with the ""fleet"" (2 ships as far as i saw max). You cant actually give them commands so a lot of times they will conflict with what you are trying to do (like board a ship and they will fire destroying it).The story is also mediocre and the VO is down right bad. There are too few side missions at least in the story mode (basically go destroy or capture target, repair or scan anomaly and move cargo/vip from station to station). The game is pretty at times ( i liked the varied ship art) and the music is quite good also at times. Would not recommend it unless really cheap 5 or less or you are bored with nothing else to play.			"

												When I first got this game, I played for about 10 minutes and was disinterested.  I really don't know why, perhaps I was a bit impatient that day.  About a week later I came back and really got pulled in.  I'm 29 hours in now and loving it.  The graphics are good, I'm enjoying the story, and I'm also free-roaming all over.  There are some quirky mechanics such as ship-boarding that make it a bit easier than it should be, but other than that I truely enjoy this game.  I've already purchased Warlords and I am looking forward to how that game progresses as well.  Alot of enjoyment here, just spend the time to learn the mechanics and have fun!  The developer and the community are great so this has been a good experience for me, well worth the purchase price.			"

Early Access Review
								If you have ever played Eve or any space game for that matter and are looking for a really decent game then you really need to spend a little cash and support this great and supportive groups of developers.  Just check out the forums they respond to almost every thread.  They are very understanding and listen to ""YOU"" about everything you have to say about this game as it's in alpha status even though it seem like a full release game without a story at the moment.   Fantastic investment.  I really enjoy it.  If you got burned on X rebirth like I did and have any experience with Eve I think that you will really enjoy this game!!!Kudos to the developers for such a great job!!!!!!!			"

												The 35 hours i have spend on it were several play throughs because of content missing from early access, bugs during early access and my last playthrough: This game made such an incredible impression on me that i forgot i finished it. Yep, the game is that short and uninspiring that i actually forgot ever ending it and started to play it again. And during these few minutes of finishing this game for the second time i kept asking myself: When does this get interesting? Why is the voice acting so horrible? Why is every mission the same?So i backed a game that didn't live up to its promise of being worth my memories, it can happen. They dare to sell DLC that only adds a few ships for a game thats been finished 2 times in less than 35 hours? *sigh*			"

												A solid effort for those who enjoyed Freelancer.  Early impressions 7/10.  The fact I've been pretty non stop should bump it up more, but there are a few nagging things I'd like to see improved over time.1) When I'm shooting at a target many of the rounds appear to pass through and not impact on the targets shield or ship body.  I'm still doing damage, but that sense of kinetic/energy contact would help the immersion.2) AI tactics are in the early game underwhelming.  I'd like to see enemies do more drastic evasive manouevers to look like they're concerned about you as a threat a bit,			"

												Short Version: If you like space tactical combat, exploration, a bit of trading and if you're not just looking for another stupid space dogfighting simulator, this might just be the game for you. At a decent price and with DLC at a very low price, this game is totally worth a shot. It's not without it's flaws though. The devs, apparently, take player input seriously and are constantly looking for ways to further improve the game, which is rare nowadays.The long version:The Good:- You actually feel like you're in command of your ship. You're flying tripulated ships with several guns and missiles to fire on your enemies and sometimes even fighters and bombers to assist you! This is not another stupid ""dogfighting style camera view"". It's more tactical and I love the devs for making that choice.- Combat is very interesting and you can decide how you want your engine/shields/weapons focus in the middle of the fight.- Graphics are very good and the design is ""colorful"".- You actually feel like you're evolving as you advance in the game and have access to new ships. There are many options to suit your playstyle.- You can fly Capital ships (dreadnoughts and carriers) and they're not useless sitting ducks like they're in EVE online. In Starpoint Gemini 2, you can actually destroy smaller ships in the blink of an eye flying one of those, as it's supposed to be when you're flying a freaking Battlestar with fighters and tons of guns at your disposal.- Devs are constantly looking from feedback from the playerbase and they're very active on forums, taking players advices and questions and participating on the debates in a polite and helpful manner.- You can send your troops to board enemy ships and try to steal them in a very interesting and original mechanic. Nothing like trying different strategies and escaping with a nick of health from a battle after taking your former enemy's ship with you in tow back to a station.- Capital ships!- DLC at a very low price that offered some new content.- Did I mention Capital ships?!The Bad:- Several things are not clear on the tooltips and there are no manuals inside the game. There is no ""ship encyclopedia"" as you'd expect on a title like this.- The difference between weapon types, bombers, fighters and interceptors is not clear.- There are not too many weapon types in the game. It seems like it lacks some variety.- There is no clear DPS indication. There's an ""average"" indicator on weapons, but you have to calculate the firing rate manually to figure that out, apparently, so it's hard, at a glance, to know which weapon to use as an upgrade.- The management of your shields could improve and be something more like Star Trek Online, where you have to define what side gets the bonuses.- The way ""Fire at will"" works should be improved on. You could mark targets (as you do with fighters) and your tripulation would shoot them, instead of firing on everything and everyone around randomly as it is right now.The Ugly:- A few bugs still annoy me, such as not being able to launch the game if I have Teamviewer service running on the background or not being able to run the game in window mode simulating full screen. If I alt tab while in fullscreen, the game will switch to a window mode, and I have to close and reopen the game to load the fullscreen again. Another bug happens when you take a mission and you're unable to complete that, such as the missions that tell you to patrol and when you get to the place you're supposed to go, nothing happens.- Voice acting is TERRIBLE.- Missions get repetitive quickly, so you'll be unwilling to play after the grind for the big ships is over.- Strongest ship unlocks at level 40, so nothing to look forward to after that level.- Story is poor.

												I can not believe how much fun I am having with SPG2.   I have played the X games and enjoyed them, however, I always found them obtuse and very difficult to learn.  SPG2 is simple by comparison but this in no way a bad thing.  They have found all the elements I found fun and pulled them out and made an awesome game.   Combat is fun, I feel like I am in control of a mighty star ship, not some egg with guns.   However, if your not careful you can be over run and taken down.  The ballance is great, I have died but never have I said ""but why"" or ""that wasn't fair"" .   There is Traiding in the game but its simple, again not a bad thing.  If I wanted Stock market sim 2015 I'd have gone and bought that.   This is a nice system to make money with that I don't have to spend weeks reserching prices and locations.    Mining and salvage as well, but again, I don't have to spend a week trying to find a station that sells mining or salvage mod for my ship.   Weapons are again Simple.  havinge 300 different items that all do basicly the same thing isn't a plus in my books.  3 weapon types with several items for each class and clear choices which is better.  Ships are again simple with up to 10 systems to worry about.   I find no fun in the need to have 100 different system for a ship.... simple is better.I Now have 35 hours in this game,  one of my top single player game in my libray now.  I find it difficult to find any con's for this game that the DEV's seem to be very involed in.   My only thought is More Ships, but again keep it simple.Awesme game all around.			"

												Didn't expect much and got a masterpiece. I thought this was some 2D tower defense game and I was wrong. This is a brilliant 3D space game with tactical combat, fantastic soundtrack and the devs have a beautiful sense of humor. You are transporting Annoying Guy to the next station, pirates attack you while you have your cargo hold full of adult magazines and things like that. Modding community is very active and there are so many mods here that everyone can find something for themselves. Star Wars, Star Trek, you name it. Highly recommended!			"

												Since all the other recent reviews were so negative I avoided this until it was 80%-off.If you can get it at that price then I certainly recommend it but that doesn't make liars of the other reviewers - at full price it is too buggy, limited and awkward (when you start) to recommend.Bugs (under Win 10) - rare crashes to desktop after 10+ hours continuous play, not-at-all-rare and repeatable loss of accepted (but not completed) missions on loading a game.Limited - like most space games it's deliver this there, do this there, kill that there.  Get money and experience for a bigger ship so you can do the same missions against bigger enemies.Awkward - the context-menu takes a bit of getting used to and there can be a LOT going on at some points so you need to practice to keep up with everything.  This is especially true when boarding ships in the middle of an ongoing battle, but then capturing three or four ships in a single engagement is unusual and earns mega-credits.  Seriously, play it right and you can buy a ship, use it to capture enemies in a battle and immediately afford the next bigger ship.  Practice does pay off though and after a few hours it all feels pretty straightforward.Bigger, longer battles really bring out the awesome in this game.  It might not be Eve level but it has Elite beaten!  I have seen groups of 4 factions fighting each other (with me generally mixing it in the middle ^^) with reinforcements spawing/arriving for battles of 20-30 or so ships at a time, lasting 20 minutes and leaving more 'derelict's than I cared to name.  That's nice, because you can drift around after the battles and loot all those dead ships for all sorts of goodies.  Naturally,  you have to be in a pretty substantial ship yourself if you're going to survive such an event.Broadly, it starts grindy and confusing, quickly gets interesting and gets better the longer you play.  Until 'been there, done that' sets in (in free roam).			"

												Do I recommend it? Of course I do! It's a bloody masterpiece! And the fact that a team so small made a game this big is something I deepply respect. And that they are giving us free content updates regulary. And that they are actively talking to us on forums. And that they implement most of community suggestions. And that they made the game highly moddable and with Workshop support. Yes I deeply respect that and I wholeheartedly recommend this game. Even if you leave it after the campaign, you will still have more than 20 hours in it which alone makes it worth its price.Their newest game, Warlords is still in alpha but I can see how bigger and better it might become until release. If you want to participate in Early Access, go with Warlords, and if you want a finished game, go with SPG2.			"

Early Access Review
								Finally a game that has the potential to be even better than Freelancer - and that says something.Took me about 2-3 hours to get familiar with everything and to be able to play the game properly, even after playing years with space sims and space, so allow yourself a bit of time when first playing. Still in beta at the time of writing, so if something not works as it supposed to, for example crashes, or missions cannot be completed, strange enemy behaviour, do not get annoyed, the devs are constant fixing bugs and writing the game, developing. It is in a playable state already; you get a fairly powerful ship at the start, you can fly around, explore, get missions like repairing space bases, destroying pirates and playing taxi between distant bases. There is a good(ish) tutorial on the start to which you can go back any time, so you are not left alone to find out what is where. My biggest problem was having the ship not powerful enough, not fast enough and not having strong enough shileds until I found out about the quick and very handy power distribution feat - this is in the tutorial, but the information was so overwhelming that my attention slipped by the end and learned as I went along with the missions. I think (hope) there will be a smoother tutorial in the final version, perhaps like the one we get in Eve.  Everything I have seen in the game so far makes me think it was a good buy and worth every penny. I'm looking forward to see the final version and what other goodies will the devs come up. Recommendation: BUY IT !!!!			"

												So here we go. First of all, I found this because of it's Star Wars mod. As a huge SW fan, the option to fly Star Destroyer and wreak havoc across the galaxy was too tempting to resist. That said, I have to say that this game shines everywhere. It's just that good.PROS:+ Ship design+ Mods (Workshop)+ Music+ Combat+ Funny moments+ Developer support+ Community+ Free content updatesCONS:- Size (it's not really a game problem, but m Internet availability in Ethiopia)- Average voice-oversI would buy this over and over again.

												This game takes a bit to get used to. Also theres not too many guides to tell you the smaller information. Like if selling or buying the colors change. (Green good -red bad) between selling and buying.  So if your buying an item that is green its a better deal and if your selling an item  that is green its a profit.  Also they don't address the fact that after you take over a ship through boarding you need to grapple with the ship to take it back to a base to sell.  I left 1 ship out in space on accident that way.  Also there is a huge curve when it comes to getting new ships.  The first zone only carries 3 ships so your forced to go to different spaces and bases to find the one thats right for you. 9/10 gameplay (Its fun to play in space thats open ended)6/10 support (even manual doesn't answer all the questions)7/10 controls (especially in fights its hard to steer unless you stay still by cuttng all engines.)6/10 Missions ( The missions are almost all the same)8/10  Graphics (The graphics are good quality)9/10 Customization (Would be 10 but they really don't explain why certain weapons don't go on ship)Overall I give this game a solid 8/10.

								I must say that i'm very impressed! I had low expectations about this game, but after seeing some video playthroughs and reading some reviews, I gave it a chance. And, I'm glad I did! This game really reminds me of the classic and much-loved space sim, FREELANCER.The only bad thing I notice until now is the lag that happens time to time when I switch from normal game view to the map chart or game options screen. My rig is not very powerfull (I3, 4 GB of RAM, HD 7770), but I can play all my game library without lag, with good performance. But since the game is still an ALPHA version, I'M sure the developers will fine-tune it to be more compatible with older systems.If you like spce sims, trading in space and flying beautifully detailed ships, this game is for you.

It's suprisingly very shallow, overpriced, falls short in many aspects, missions are dull and repetitive, the game feels too grindy and the world is fairly lifeless despite being beautiful. With more depth the game could have been monumental.It is certainly not a terrible game and it has some merits, but it did disappoint me. If I could give it a neutral or maybe rating I would as I don't think it deserves a thumbs down, hence my recommendation.			"

												I rarely write reviews so for me to post this you know it has to be bad. I got this at 80% off for like 8 bucks and I still think I was ripped off. Lets start:First you may see 15 hours played but that's really less than half that. Between all the random crashes and not being able to save... Oh yeah You can only save at a space dock or planet. Problem is they are so spread out and you travel so slowly(no hyperdrive mode just full impulse) you have to spend 20 minutes getting back to a save spot just so you can save your mission before it maybe crashes again. Forget trying to accomplish multipule objectives or missions in a row before a crash thats not possible. Before you ask its not my rig. They have bugs and issues all around, just do research. For such a new game to have this many issues is jarring. Speaking of bugs my second complaint: Lack of proper controller support. This nearly killed the experience for me. Sure you can theroretically use a controller but dont expect the game UI or even the menus to give a flying #$%. It says you can use a mouse and keybord with the controller but you cant, its locked at one or the other. Then all the games UI and in game menues and tutorials dont reconize the controller so good luck trying to figure out what to do. Also forget trying to use the controller to even land as there inane system wont reconize the contextual presses.  Even in 2014 this is inexcuseable, but they had multipule patches and its still terribleThat brings me to my final points, one leads into the other. This game was released in 2014 and in my opinion it was rushed for early access and beta's and all that nonsense. They made constant updates but largely all the bugs remain. Its like great you added a few things here and there but would you please fix the bugs? Nope. They made their money on this game so now they've stopped updating it compleletly to focus on Starpoint Gemini Warlords. Excuse me you release a buggy game, dont fix it, and then move on to a new one? What are you an EA wannabe? Which leads me to my last point, because of their constant pointless updates, not a single mod works. That was the last straw. I can deal with forced to use a mouse and keyboard, I was going to give the crashes a pass for the moment to see if it got better, but the *Total*  lack of mod support for only a 2,3 yo game is straight up insane and nonsense. If you know your game is moddable, you include a freakin mod manager, why would you release updates that ruin mods? And of course nobody wants to keep trying to make the mods work everytime they update. Sure theyve finally stopped but that still leaves every mod incompatable. I know what your going to say ""Dont buy games for mods"" Well honestly I do, some games I wouldnt play without them and this is one of them. Let me give you an example: The first space station you visit ""Vigo Station"" has most of the ships in the game, but you cant access the shipyard. Instead you can maybe find some research station way out in the void that maybe has a ship for a million credits thats slightly better than your starting ship. The only way to access the station is to increase your repuation but you only get 20 rep per mission. You'll out level your ship before you get enough rep to access the space port with the actual useable ships. Which you dont want to do tat because to more you level the stronger enemies become. So a simple mod that unlocks that station, and gives me access to powerful and yet affordable ships would save so much time you'd think.  Well I bought a ship and then the game crashes when I go to a planet. Then I load up the game and the screen  is blue and wiped out when I exit to space.   The developer even told me that mods no longer work for the game so there you go.  I almost feel bad, as I talked to some of the devs, and they tried to assess my problems and seemed nice. However I cant ignore these glaring issues. I only hope this review will save the moeny and time of those interested in this. I hope to get a refund for this but its my duty to warn others. I wish I never bought this game and instead bought Rebel Galaxy.			"

												Ever since I played Starpoint Gemini, I have been a big fan. The original game was very easy ot use and not too overly complicated to use. The game was in 3D, but only flew in 2D, so it wasn't hard to get form point ""A"" to point ""B"" with little effort.Starpoint Gemini 2 takes the original game several steps fruther. The concept is sitll the same. You are a space pilot looking to make a name for yourself in the age of space trader. You can either play in campiagn or in freemode.Some of the things that have improved since the first game are as follows...1.) Flight is now in 3D instead of 2D2.) You no longer have to use jump gates to get to your destination3.) A lot more ships to choose from4.) Ships have a lot more upgrades to choose from5.) Some ships offer a ""Flight Deck"" where you can send small fighters out while you battle6.) Not only can you have a flight deck, but you can also choose which kind of fighters you want7.) This time, you can also land on planets as well as star bases8.) Combat is lot more ""tactical"" than before9.) You can now make friends and enemies, this determines if you are able to land on stations or planets10.) There are now factions, each with their own likes and dislikes about you and other factions11.) More items to buy and trade12.) Major improvementts on comba, flight, and trading system13.) There is now a fully viewable starchart you can use to determine where you are versus where you goOverall a much more enjoyable game with added features that allow a lot mroe to do as well as a lot more offer. The added bonus of flight decks is also very helpful for when you need that added help durig combat. If you are into the Space Trader system that has true 3D concept of space flight, this is a good game to get. If you loved Starpoint Gemini, you will love this second part. The added benefit of landing on planets is a major bonus from the original game.			"

												I first fell in love with spaceship rpg games with Wing Commander Privateer. There was nothing like it at the time and I played hours and hours. Many years later, I found Freelancer and went through the same thing again, but after that nothing I played ever felt so close and so great as Starpoint Gemini 2. It has everything I loved about those games but also so much more, so many details and options and features added so well you can tell how much the developers care and love the game. I finished the storyline and all DLC and of course, I'm playing it again. And for sure won't be the last time.			"

												With all the recent updates, this game is finally playable. I think their biggest issue was releasing this so half finished originally. If you enjoyed old school games like privateer, you'll find some neat similarities, mixed with freelancer style controls. Its got a lot of good structural things going for it, but still feels light on content, which is understandable given that its a small dev team working on it. Never the less those guys managed to put together a fun space sim that doesnt take itself too seriously. If you are looking for a hardcore space sim, this isnt it, but if you are looking to fly around blowing things up and occasionally have an interesting battle, then you are in the right place. I continue coming back to this game to see new updates, and if the dev guys continue to produce content, I think this will flesh out quite nicely, so that the universe doesnt feel so barren with the same 3 mission types everywhere.

												Such a great game, we need moar space games like this.- a bit grindy for most the beginning in both money and exp.- lots of nice ships, but you'll be spending most of your time in the starting ship.- camera can be awkward but you'll get use to it, same with the controls.- capture enemy ships as much as possible and sell for credits.

												If you liked Freelancer, you will love this. Though, so far, the story hasn't been as engaging as Freelancers but there is a freeroam mode that basically cuts that aspect out of it and just throws into this really well designed and nice looking universe, for you to do in as you please.The combat is awesome, the UI is nicely layed out and easy to understand and the game isnt overly complex for the sake of being complex (I'm looking at you X series). The soundtrack is pretty cool too.Its quite fun and addictive for now, but I can see it becoming quite repetitive. I'm sure later on in the game things become a bit more interesting with bigger ships and fleet battles, but the early game requires a lot of grind it seems.I recommend buying this on sale, as it is at the time of writing this review. I can't say, yet anyway, if its worth the full asking price. Though I am having a lot of fun with it at the moment.  "

												I've seen a lot of comparisons for this game to other popular titles and I think that is a disservice to this game, because then you start looking at what this game doesn't have.Here is what the game DOES have.Great graphics at low hardware cost.  The game looks good, it looks clean, the ships are detailed and the environment is gripping, and you don't have to sell your soul to play it.Great music.  It's the type of music you'd expect to hear if there were an intergalactic space composer.Lots of ship options:  There are enough choices to make your personal mark on the universe.Space:  Everything is better in space.Combat:  Everything is better with combat, especially in space.Great development team:  They are VERY involved with the community and the community is VERY involved with development, in the best ways I have ever seen, ever.It is a good game, at a low cost, that will provide many hours of enjoyment.

												I don't often write reviews, but when I do, it's for a product I love. Starpoint Gemini is probably one of the most fun space games I've played. It feels reminiscent of the X series in a much-welcomed third person perspective(Though you have the option of using a mounted cam perspective instead if you prefer), with the noticeable lack of any empire-building elements to speak of; likewise controlling a fleet is very limited by comparison, and as far as I'm aware you have to be pretty far into the game to even start a fleet.The game, much like X, has a campaign option(Which I haven't played and therefore cannot comment on) and a sandbox mode. In the sandbox mode, you pick a starting ship and get thrown out into the universe with the usual obnoxious tutorial screens, and then it's pretty much straight into the action. Your prime objective for most of if not the entirety of the game will be to make more money, which you have several options for obtaining, such as mining, hunting criminals, trading goods, or pirating goods. It's all quite fun, but the payouts are generally small in comparison to the price of ships and equipment upgrades, meaning you're definitely going to have to spend several hours chauffeuring sales reps and diplomats through hostile territory and mining asteroids by the hundreds to ever afford that ship upgrade, but this is balanced out by the fact that the starting ships are pretty powerful generally speaking, and should last you as long as you'll use them... Though that doesn't mean that the money grind is any less monotonous.I'm not saying it isn't fun. It's just not as rewarding as it could've been. You grind money for the sake of getting a bigger ship, for the sake of grinding more money more easily, for the sake of getting a bigger ship. Perhaps the campaign provides more variety, but the sandbox is in desperate need of some more money-sinks.Graphically, the game is a joy to look at, though the fact that I rarely dabble into anything this modern could be skewing my opinion here a little. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon or an anime, and colours are very vibrant, making literally everything stand out dramatically. The only thing worth complaining about in terms of graphics is the little debris particles that fly past your ship during movement, as they're practically the size of my tiny gunship's cockpit, but thankfully there's already a mod to remove them.All in all... It's definitely not a bad game. There are better games out there for the price, but I'd still recommend picking this up if you have money to blow, especially if you're a fan of space games. And if it's on sale right now, slap yourself for even giving it a second thought and then buy it. Just a forewarning however, it will definitely annihilate your social life.			"

												Purchased on recommendation from a friend and loved it.Didn't have any of the technical issues that others have posted, and the comment about missions outleveling yourself is silly because each mission has a recommended level.  Not at that level? Do some sidequests or freelancing to level up - just like any open world game!The storyline is interesting but not essential, although I would recommend playing through at least a few hours of the story before jumping into a purely-freelance game because the early quests train you quite well.

												This game was exactly what I had hoped; a mix of EVE online (minus the spreadsheets) and more action orientated space games like Freespace.I played through the storyline which served it's purpose of driving things forward but beyond that is rather forgettable. It also featured some of the worst voice acting / writing I have heard in a long time. Thankfully the sandbox of different mission types, trading and exploring more than makes up for it. One of the more enjoyable scenarios is ship capture where you have to whittle the targets shields and hull down to the limit and then board the ship with your troopers with the aim to capture it. This has big pay off's and lets you bank huge sums of money to buy new ships and gear.The ships are the main stay of SG2, they are nicely varied and do not fall into the EVE trap where every ship has to have its trade off's, in SG2, a Dreadnought can kick serious ♥♥♥ against all sized ships as you would expect and is a blast to play with.This game is a solid 8/10 and had me hooked all the way up until I had the best Dreadnought and Carrier available and could just mop up. Definitely looking forward to SG3 with hopefully some more budget thrown at it to get some writers / voice actors in to bring the lore to life.			"

												I am really enjoying Starpoint Gemini 2!  Having never played the original, I was a little nervous about buying the sequel, but that isn't a problem at all!  Free roam mode gives you a blank canvas and you can do pretty much whatever you want.  The option is also available during the campaign, but I always feel compelled to stick with the story rather than go off and do my own thing for a little while.  Due to this, I have not spent much time at all on the campaign.  Doing random missions, trading, capturing enemy ships, and exploring have all distracted me from that.  However, the five minutes or so I have spent on the campaign were not all that impressive (shoddy voice acting, uninteresting writing). So, do I recommend this game?  Absolutely, just not for the story.  Get this game if you want to get lost in a space sim for hours, not for some kind of an epic drama.			"

												I'm a fan of space games. The problem with them has been for years that there's no depth to trading or interesting story to delve into. Quests in this one are all either mail carrier types or combat based. The fighting is fairly uninteresting as well.On the plus side, the graphics are very good and I loved the scenery. The game does have a very large area to explore if that is yoru thing, but as I mentioned above, it gets very monotonous quickly due to lack of depth.The other big flaw is that the only real way in this game to make money is by capturing ships. You can trade or just do missions, but it would take an awful grind to get enough money to change ships which seems like a balance flaw to me.Even on sale, I'm going to actually suggest you skip this one. No, there doesn't seem to be much better out there, but I would say you are better off never playing than to waste time on such a shallow game.			"

								*WOW*Space sims have almost disappeared as a genre over the last 15 years or so, but this is the most promising one I've play since X-3.  Having been disappointed by the original Starpoint Gemini, this mere Alpha of Starpoint Gemini 2 really blew me away.  The dev comment ""hugely improved sequel"" is very much an understatement.  I barely got my feet wet, but this game is literally a decade ahead of its amateurish predecessor.Forget all the wrongs of the original Starpoint Gemini (or just forget that game entirely), SG2 fixes all the terrible compromises it made:1. No longer locked a 2-D plane, you have full six degrees of freedom.  As the developer blurb says ""everything now is in 3D!""  *shock, horror* 2. No wierd incremental steering. (I guess you have to play the original to understand this one.)  As I said earlier, full six degrees of freedom.  Pitch, yaw, and roll to your heart's delight.  There's even a toggle to steer with you mouse for more precision dogfighting.3. No amateur voice actors reading non-native English scripts.  Not a lot of voice acting in the alpha, but what it did have was professionally polished.4. No hideous 2002-era low poly character renders.  Hand-drawn 2D portraits FTW!In general, the production values are up to what you'd expect from a modern game.  Those screeenshots don't lie, it really does look that good in-game.  The soundtrack and sound design is also very well done.  The UI is beautiful, handles well, and very user friendly.It's still alpha, so there some key content missing (mainly the campaign, and the the trade system is very under-developed), but so far this looks like the first promising successor to the Elite/Privateer/Freelancer legacy in years.

												Ok this is my edited review. I'll try and be semi-objective as I have interacted with the dev's, their moderator and the community for some time. But please read on and judge for yourself.Spg2 is a tactical space combat sim. I joined in EA and didn't play it for long due to hardware limitations on my account but liked the idea of a big massive universe where the player doesn't end up being the ""King of the Hill"" but just a small piece of a bigger universe. And Spg2 filled that need for me. This is not the most epic game I've ever played and I didn't expect it to be. But from a small ~10-ish Croation developer team I've been surprised. Not only have these guys made their own engine which shows beatiful graphical capability but they also constantly updated the game for almost a year after release with steady patching and a nice and cheap DLC while being constantly (I can't express how crazy these dev's are when it comes to listen to player feedback and troubleshooting with the community, it's unheard of) active on forums and responding to any bug report they received and fixing it with each new update. This is more than half the reason I'd buy any game they'd ever release.Well about the game; There are more in-depth Space Games out there, more epic stories to be told. But this game doesn't pretend to be any of that. It knows it's limitations as a huge space universe where the player is just a small piece of the puzzle. And it does that extremely well. Imagine being in a single-player MMO ( yeah kind of contradictory) but that's how this game treats you. You're nothing more special than the next dude around. You won't change the Universe all by yourself but you're just a small part in a bigger scheme. I love that sense of relating to your own existence in the world. How many games dares that anymore? In an age where we all feel we're the turning point and center of the Universe this game is a fresh breath teaching us the Universe doesn't resolve around us but we're just here to try to survive and do the best we can. There's no classic story arch to this game. You don't end up feeling like you're the king of the world. You're just a captain in the void trying to fend for him or herself. That's it. And from a philosophical perspective I love that notion. Too many games rub your need for being the ""one and only"". Not this game. This is reality expressed through a game. You're not gonna matter more than others but still need to claim your place in the world. That's beautiful and invigorating and  ... well poetic in some sense. There's a story (campaign) in the game that lends itself to the lore created in Spg1. But former knowledge of that is not required. I am still on the last mission of that storyline but that's not the reason I play Spg2. I don't relate that much to the story as such but enjoy the stories I can make with my own captains more.The game lets you choose between story and freeroam missions at a whim. You can always wander off to do randomly generated missions even when playing the campaign (campaign has a fixed character while freeroam lets you generate your own male/female character) and explore as you see fit. My preference and love for space was to be more of a ""freelancer"" doing randomly generated missions for different factions making friends and enemies along the way depending on my choice of the missions I'd carry out for different factions (help one faction=lose reputation with another faction and vice versa). The game can be a grind for some, other cherish that type of neverending possibilities and in Spg2 the ever-changing possibilities for changing your reputation and the constant randomly generated missions can keep you playing this for hours on end.Some days I just log in, cloak my ship and enjoy the scenery. Other days I just log in to take my temper out on whatever faction I'm currently in bad standing with and make them suffer. For a better description of the game check some videos on Youtube or other reviews. I'm still sold on this thing and the constant updates, a very nice and cheap DLC plus the upcoming FREE DLC makes me wanna recommend this game to everybody. Best and coolest development team I've ever meet and a hell of a positive and friendly community.This game is Steam History for the books. The reason I still get into EA from time to time is because of these guys right here. This is a game made by gamers to gamers. And a hella lot of respect for their interaction, back-and-forth, constant updates and pleasent attitude. If you're in doubt visit the forum. These guys are the future of gaming and a pinnacle of how developers can make gamers trust and cherish them again (yeah plenty of jaded gamers out there seeing bigger companies ♥♥♥♥ all over their customers or make highly dubious decisions).Edit: It should be noted that this game twists a few familiar concepts of games and how to progress the best possible way. There's not much ""hand-holding"" here but the forum is pretty active to anyone needing a tip or two on how to get the most of it and learn those ""different"" mechanics/understanding from what other games usually bring. So remember to pitch in with questions if there are any or you don't understand something. The early game in particular can be a bit rough for new players but once they get a hang of it it's really not that hard to understand. over 9000 / 10			"

												Trader, Warrior, Pirate, Explorer, Bounty Hunter, Miner, Smuggler - a few of the things you can be in the Gemini Sector.  This game puts you in the boots of a newbie starship captain in one of the most volitile areas of human colonization, and it's your choice as to what you will do with your newfound freedom.  Will you avenge your father and find out why he was killed in the storyline?  Will you go off and discard your past in the free-roam sandbox mode?  The choice is yours.You start out with a very basic gunship, but the game doesn't limit you to one ship like some others (Darkstar One, X-Rebirth), but instead gives you the option to upgrade and upgun in one of several ship classes.  Do you like the thought of zipping around in a fast, maneuverable stealth corvette?  You've got several to choose from.  Maybe you'd prefer to roll into a hostile area in one of the mighty dreadnaughts or carriers and outgun everything in the zone (except perhaps another dreadnaught or carrier)?  You can do that, too.  Or you'd like to be a trader, working your way from your starter ship to a freighter, and then a freightliner, ferrying cargo, buying cheap and selling high.  Again, your choice, but remember to pack guns to keep the pirates off your back, as they have the same choice in ships as you do!  You'll do all of this in a *very* good-looking setting that has NPC ships doing their own thing according to their own agendas.  My personal favorite example of this was the time I was attacked by a group of pirates.  I was in a destroyer, which is fairly middle-of-the-pack in speed-to-guns/armor, and flying with a group of trader ships.  The pirates jumped us, I engaged...and the traders *bolted!*  Left me there and ran, as they weren't going to stick around and slug it out with pirates that outgunned them (being businessmen in freighters rather than naval officers in warships, it seemed their AI told them to GTFO).  Just as I was swearing to hunt them down (if I survived this and didn't have to reload halfway across the map), security forces from the nearby station arrived with battleships and cruisers and what was a brutal last stand became a lopsided pirate turkey shoot.  Brilliant!Starpoint Gemini does a lot of things right, and the devs have shown a lot of interest and support in the community.  There were a few bugs on first release, but continual support has polished this into a real gem most space-sim fans will enjoy greatly.  9/10			"

												A very good game. Don't expect it to last longer than 2 weeks though. You can do a lot of things like: 1. Upgrading your ship. 2. Commanding a carrier type ship with 4 turret slots and 4 missile slots. 3. You can board another ship. 4. Station defense / Station assault type of missions. 5. Launch fighters/interceptors/bombers from your ships.The thing is that it's a very short game with a ton of good gameplay that'll keep you hooked. Unfortunately, you find yourself doing repetitive things (like boarding, mining, etc.). You'll eventually find yourself with more money than you can count and you've basically done everything there is to do in the game. Compared to other gaming simulators, this one is a junior. Great to get back into space sims, but not your ""goto"" space sim. For your ""goto"" space sim, I would actually recommend the following games: 1. Elite Dangerous (Once it's released. It might already be I don't know). 2. Star Citizen (This game promises a lot and has a lot of potential. Wait for it to be released)3. X: Rebirth 3.0 (I know some of you space sims fans HATE this game, but in reality, this game had a very shaky start with bugs that would render the game useless, but in version 3.0, almost all of these bugs have been fleshed out, there's a ton of new features, and it's a GRAND game). I've been playing X: Rebirth 3.0 for a month now and I have yet to do everything it offers. It's beautiful!			"

								This game caught my eye a few months ago, but at the time it did not really seem like a good buy since everyone was anticipating that Xrebirth would be a super awesome game. Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.Yesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent.

								This is an absolutely cracking game. For an early-access alpha version, it is incredibly polished and looks beautiful. No bugs that I have run across yet, and it runs so smoothly. Kind of a cross between Eve and X3.Highly recommended			"

								In short I enjoy the game even though it's  in pre-release, it's simply fun to play. It's the game I go to when I'm in between some the more well known or mainstream games. The dev's work hard on the game and it's come a long way since it's beginings. Which makes it a joy  to see all of the new fixes and changes to the game every time I come back to it. There are plenty of well stated reviews  both positive and negative so I won't say much, however as for me was the game and is the game worth the price? If it's worth my time to play it then it's worth money. This game is continuely getting better and improving all he time.			"

								This game caught my eye a few months ago, but at the time it did not really seem like a good buy since everyone was anticipating that Xrebirth would be a super awesome game. Then Xrebirth came out. Luckily i did not jump on the hype wagon (learned my lesson) and when the first videos came out i was stunned by how terrible the whole game was.Yesterday I saw this game on Humble bundle for a few bucks, so I took a look at some videos on YouTube and found that it looked pretty decent. Then I read a few reviews, and found that this could totally be the one game that can fill the X's place.I was not disappointed!!! THIS is how X3 should be done. Everything is done right, even though many features are still missing, like the ability to create fleet, owning stations/player faction, more ways of modifying weapons (custom mods maybe).

												Possibly one of the best games I have ever played and it isn't even finished! People litterally write to the devs wanting to pay more just to get more content. The devs unlike most care more about their legacy then making money. This is the perfect freelancer 2 which sadly never happened. You can explore, trade, raid ships, and despite forcing your progression, you can't fly ships you level isn't high enough for. The game battles are balanced, and even when you are flying mega ships, you can quickly find your self getting swarmed by many many smaller vessles. There has to be a balance between devs and profits. Unlike Payday 2, this game NEEDS to sell updates to keep it going.			"

												This game is totally worth every penny.  Not only do I have a passion for space/sci-fi genres (as well as a few others) but the fact that they give you both a campaign and free roam mode only games it better since free roam basically lets you do what you wish.  You command a ship and can do whatever you want. Become a pirate and capture other ships and their cargo, become a trader and buy/sell goods between planets and space stations, become a bountry hunter, and much more... It also helps that the Gemini system (map) is pretty damned big with constant activity.  My favorite moments involve coming upon large battles between factions, or simple skirmishes between myself and a couple other ships turn into a huge battle when other nearby factions decide to intervene to either help or harm me. Best part about the space battles is that it feels so real... ships are all on the same plane as if on an ocean/sea, they're everywhere at all angles. Another huge point in favor of the game is how amazing the graphics are without reducing performance (that I have noticed and have a pretty good gaming computer) though there is a lag whenever you move to another sector, but that barely effects me.The games doesn't restrict you to certain areas... you can go anywhere and everywhere they do limit you in other ways... depending on you reputation, different sectors will be hostile to you and some sectors have high level enemies in them. One major problem (in my opinion) is the repetative nature of the side missions and very few secondary missions (those give to you by factions depending on your reputation and level.  Antoher problem is how long it takes to level up and to get to the higher level so as to be able to fly around in a dreadnought or carrier.Overall, I'd have to give this game 9/10.			"

								This is striking me very much as what X:Rebirth was supposed/hyped to be. The game is rendered in a beautiful 3d environment and, while fiddly to get used to (it's a little more clunky than the X series of games), once you're used to it, you won't encounter much in the way of problem. Right now, there's not a whole lot to do other than explore the universe but then, what did you expect? It's a pre-release game!I decided to support LGM because, quite honestly, I didn't with SPG 1 and, in hindsight, I wish I had because it's a company that hasn't forgotten the golden rule in the gaming industry;                                                      ""Listen to what your fans want, then make it for them.""So many authors make the game THEY want and then wonder why the game bombs. In my own experience, Mass Effect 3 was that game but I'm sure most of the readers have at least one recent title they can apply that to. LGM listens, they adapt and incorporate into the game and they're not shy about it, either.So, if you're after a non-mmo space simulator (Elite springs to mind), this is definately for you. Hell, for less than £20, you're not going to do much better at the moment. Get it while it's hot because it promises to be an amazing experience. Graphically and audiably it's breath taking by anyones standards..Now, where did I put those secret pictures of Dr. Ridley.......			"

								One of the top quality early access games available.Devs are active,dedicated and very open to suggestions from players.Great looking space scenes, tons of ships and loadouts. Mining/trading/combat is all included, gives me back the good old feeling like I experienced in the game freelancer. Mods are already available even though its still early access.Only negative sofar is an occasional crash every x hours, but devs are aware of this and using the save system you can avoid lost time/progress.

								If you enjoy open world exploring and the freedom to do anything you want then this is the game for you. I got this game and to have seen it evolve from something basic into a more complex game with amazing graphics and some spectacular battles the potential is endless. There are a number of good things about this game such as the ability to choose what you want to do from being a pirates to trader, or if you like just fly around and find random things to do. you can even captur enemy ships even bigger ones if you chose to do the upgrades for your troops, you can then either sell these ships off for at times big money or keep them for yourself and use them. The graphics in this game are amazing for a space simulator with astroids thatt look like astroids to ships that look really good. the major con for me at this point is that there isn't any real story yet so no actual campaign to do but the story that they have set up really does have the potential to be great.

								even for its beta state, game is very promising. i expect it to become a new modern X3 for space sim/shooter/rts fans.game gets updated very frequently, i only think that s because due to positive outcome product of sale amount. i mean steam playerbase support should be good enough to make the devs work hard like this.i want to point some unique points about this game.-enhancement system for ship parts, not only you can change your offensive,defensive,special outputs but you can also further tweak the bonuses with part enhancement, offers you very high amount of combinations.- high amount of factions, each faction's missions gets randomly generated depending on your current faction standings.thats nice. that means your actions have consquences.-you can actively own a fleet, and make them support you in battles or transport/hauling/smuggling.-crew salaries really a good money sink, something to think about.-game supports modding. enuf said. ^^now a bit of negatives :- currently since game is beta, the main storyline is not out yet and freelance game mode(sandbox) offers  a bit repeatitive missions.- traveling might take some time, there s no time acceleration/deacceleration- using map, pauses your game. you cant watch your ship moves while on starchart. that makes creating waypoints make game stop and cost you time.- current number of pilot classes only 3 and each has 4 different active abilities, these 4 abilities each has 5 sub categories changing characteristics of active skills, this s a bit few, could have been more.-after accepting each mission, you have to find objective area/station etc manually via starchart. you gotta click each marker and see which one lets you create waypoint/jump etc.- accepted and offered quests have same color markers on starchart. again no visual clue for finding your active missions' waypoint.- there s a quest log but not really helpful , doesnt fully work atm. therefore if you serious about completing your missions, you gotta take and complete 1 by 1. unlike other rpgs you cannot hoard multiple missions and do it with a spree.not at the moment. Doesnt apply to people with super memory- you cannot purchase spacestations or other type of stationary npc controlled objects. not yet.TLDR, summary : the game runs smooth and not many bugs for its state, gameplay wise there re many things to add. lack of variety atm might be boring but combat is fun and makes up for it. im pretty sure as it develops, many new features gonna be added and this game has potential to beat X3 in future in open beta. only if devs keep the game updated just like now.

								[Review based on Early Access beta, v.0.7015]A fantastic action-oriented space sim (with some RPG-like elements added in), with beautiful visuals (and smooth framerates), a fairly big universe to explore (with hints from the developer that it's going to get bigger), lots of ships to fly and loads of weapons, equipment and upgrades to fit to them to tune them for any task.Currently only ""free play"" is available, but there's still lots to see and plenty to do. The game is already very fun and entertaining, and shows great promise. I look forward to the full release, and recommend this game for any fan of the space sim genre.			"

								This is going to be short and sweet.I like this game. Its a single player 'EVE' without the ridiculous complexity. Obviously its not without issues, personally i have to keep all of the settings low to get a decent frame rate but that might just be my machine and im sure it wont be a problem once optimisation is introduced.My only major gripe is the lack of fuller content. So far the freelance missions are pretty much the same few objectives in varying difficulty but they are quick enough that its not too much of a trouble to level. I think once the proper campaign is introduced it will make the game a lot more enjoyable.			"

												This game looks beautiful, even on the lowest graphics settings. The music is wonderful and sound effects are great. Voice acting is... well, pretty terrible in all honesty, but I'm really impressed that a pretty small indie developer managed to get as much voice acting in this game in the first place! That tends to be an enormous expense in any game, and it's still better than the voice acting in Just Cause 2 or Strike Suit Zero.However, even with two years of steady work, the game still suffers of performance issues and frequent crashes. I can accept a lot of problems but I really hate having to restart the game so many times in one evening. Last I heard, the devs are still actively working on the game - I hope they'll find these last crash and lag sources and fix them someday soon, because until then I won't be able to play this thing more than maybe half a hour a day. If the crashes are finally fixed, I'll be more than happy to recommend this game.			"

												I wish there was a neutral button, or I could give a 10 star review. I would give this game a ""5"". In my continued quest to find a game of equal or greater quality to old WIndows game ""Freelancer"", I was hoping I had found it with this one. I was NOT sorely dissapointed, but it's kinda a rather bland game...It's like getting a coffee but no cream and sugar, or a turkey dinner with no mashed potatoes. The core concept is there....just they didn't cook it long enough.Mechanics are good, the idea is great, beautiful graphics and awesome full 3D flying, and I love the slip-stream ""Surfing"" idea, but I just can't get my attention to be held. For my limited playing, I felt the story dragged, I could not afford to be a trader and spent most of my time jacking pirate ships, looting them, dragging them back to a nearby base to sell. (FYI: Your crews DO NOT take over the ship and fly along with you as an escourt - At least from what I experienced during my limited gameplay. It took me about 3 lost ships before I realized you had to tractor the ship back to a station :P )I am hoping either these guys do a MASSIVE update on this game, or maybe they will get it right in the next game they are making. I'm certainly willing to give their next one a chance. However until then, my ""Freelancer"" parody search continues.			"

								The developers for SG2 really set the bar into the stratosphere for early access. There are more renowned titles that aren't this polished at release. While they've been busy building this game, we, the players have been exploring the vast systems of SG2 in it's already space worthy assortment of vessels.The graphics are silky and the models imaginative. The game play is smooth and intuituve. And being fully supported by the Steam Workshop allows the players uninhibited creativity. Many have paid twice as much for a ""finished"" product that promised the galaxy but couldn't deliver the moon. SG2 delivers the solar system, the galaxy and the cosmos for half the price.The responsive developer team never let's too much time pass before they're reassuring the community that they're forging ahead to a quality release. Lord Have Mercy! When they add the remaining content and features, this game, if not overlooked should be considered top in it's class for 2014.			"

The artwork for Starpoint Gemini 2 is very good. They have an intro video for the game story that will be added later. Really glad to have bought this game, it's worth the money.

								It is indeed a great game in the making, but the only think I would love to see that great games such as skyrim didn't do is have a multiplayer option. Goto friends or bring friends and have adventures with each other, a game as good as this is better with a friend! I get there is other games like this one like EVE, but I hate playing with people I don't know very well and backstabbers. A multiplayer option like borderlands 2 that lets your game be ether wide open or closed only for many or few of your closest friends to share the experience with. Thats all I will complain about this game, other than that it something to play. Takes a bit to learn but it's worth it!!			"

												I`ve put quite a few hours into this one and whilst there is alot to like, it is ultimatley a very detached and empty experience. I found it hard to care about the games universe and different factions. The battles were just too arcade like and not much fun. Ships close into engagement range quickly and from then its usually a case of putting on auto turret fire and carrying out some random evasive manourvres. There didn`t seem much in the way of strategy or tension.  And reaching higher level ships just seems to up the stats- there just isn`t that satisfying feeling of pwer from owning a battleship or Dreadnought. This could have been so much more.			"

								It takes a bit to get into the controlling your ship, but once you realize you’re not flying a fighter but a large ship it gets easier. Zig-zagging around to evade hostile fire, turning around to get your full weapon batteries within firing range and arc, transferring power between systems, sending out troopers to other ships, capturing them, mining asteroids, salvaging stuff from derelicts… it’s all in here.An awesome buy! I definitely RECOMMEND it to everyone who’s into space games. And with the first game offered in the bundle AND at a discount, this is a steal!			"

												Tried it again after a few months and boy has it changed! Now a fully working Main campaign is in place, the money system makes much better sense, the fleet system is fully operational and many, many other positive changes.I have really enjoyed playing the first few campaign missions, taking some time to earn some experience hunting pirates, patrolling areas or ferrying people around. It is overall a good experience and it has a lot to keep you on your toes, enemies to attack of run from, and interesting mechanics. Specially there are many possibilities to travel around the map, which is big and ould take ""forever"" to get from one corner of the Gemini Sector to another....you have T-Gates, wormholes, ""Space currents"" (which you actually surf, damned fun!), and even your own (expensive) T-Drive to hop around.Thumbs up and best thing is this is not finished yet! They keep adding and polishing things!			"

												Has some warts, I won't deny it.  This coming from a WC2/Privateer/Freespace player, I like this game overall but there are some negatives that might steer people away from it.  The voice acting IS pretty meh, and the UI/menu interface leaves something to be desired (buying/selling goods isnt exactly clear at first glance); the complaint about expensive T-gates I get, though I went out and sought the license for this immediately (making it available nearby to the starting area honestly makes more sense rather than halfway across the galaxy).Still, the game is fun and interesting, exploring the different regions of space was especially enjoyable if a bit hazardous if I wandered too far into hostile territory.  If one can see past the negatives the game is extremely fun.			"

												Very good space game, I'm so pleased this genre is making a comeback!I've not played a huge amount yet, but enough to get the feel for it and I'm really enjoying it so far.In this game you are flyng a large ship with a crew, not a one-man fighter, so it feels more like Freelancer, ST Bridge Commander, or Independence War, but it has it's own feel. The ship handling reflects this and the control scheme works really well. I tried it with a flight stick, but it's not really that kind of game, the mouse controls just feel right for the pace as you seem to spend more time targeting, selecting systems and activating powers and perks, rather than 'hands-on' flying. There is a strong RPG element in terms of building up your character and ship with equipment, skills and perks to develop. There is a lot going on and I'm sure I barely scratced the surface.Technically it's excellent, great graphics and effects, and not a massive system hog either. The soundtrack is very nicely ambient and helps to immerse rather then distracting. There is great community around this game, and the developers are obviously very keen to make improvements so I can see that there is a lot of potential for future enhancements, but the game that is on sale now is a totally complete and functional productMy only criticisms would be that the universe seems a bit impersonal, and the setting poorly explained, being a sequel to a game few have played, and the script a bit weak and generic. The English voice acting is very flat, and it might have been better to stick to text to be honest, but it's farily sparsely used and doesn't spoil the game.Overall, great game, well worth the price which is very reasonable for the amount of content and the mod support and supplied tools mean that it will have plenty of new content  to come.

												If you like open world games, and you like open world games in space, then Starpoint Gemini is absolutely worth picking up.There's some reviews out there that are comparing this to Freelancer, and I'll say so far I definitely get that same vibe. Is it ""as good"" as Freelancer? I'd say it is a little early to tell, but I feel like this is going to be a huge time sink like Freelancer in a good way.Other reviews say this is Eve ""Offline"" and I definitely see where that is coming from, and in a good way. Trading so far does take some thought, there's random pirates that you can mostly evade if you want, and there's local defense forces around that will jump in to help (even if you don't want them too). Right from the start you can start doing whatever it is you feel like doing without feeling too ""new"" for lack of a better term.I started with the Campaign, and I'd say I'm not overwhelmingly enjoying the story, but it's still early so I can't fairly judge it.As far as free roaming, which I've spent more time on, I can tell I'll be spending most of my time doing just that. I managed to capture a ship I was planning to buy when a pirate attacked me, and so the mechanic for that is interesting. I've done some repair missions, bounty hunting, salvage work, and some trading. You can mine both gas and asteroids, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. No idea if there is any exploration to be had other than wandering around.It would appear there will also be a huge variety of ships in the game, as different areas have offered different ships for sale. So far, I've seen perhaps 4 or 5 factions of ships and the faction list is pretty long. Also, these are only the small ships which your skill will correspond to purchase ability. How hard it will be to obtain the bigger ships I cannot say, but given how many credits I have versus what the prices are on them, it does not appear to be a grindfest.The map feels pretty large, and it takes some time to get around each sector. At first, the map did not look all that large fully zoomed out, until I started panning around. Then I realized there was a LOT more and I've barely scratched the surface. 3 hours in, and doing a fair amount of travelling, and I have only made a small dent in the map BEFORE you pan anywhere!Combat takes a little getting used to, but I was also learning the controls, and I'm pretty competent now which was why I tried boarding a ship. The boarding mechanic is more or less getting close enough to grapple the target ship, then send boarding parties aboard to kill their defenders. Larger ships have more troops, so don't expect to successfully board a battleship with a gunship. You can also go into a ""turret mode"" to keep your guns trained on an enemy ship. While you might have some turrets blocked depending on ship design, you might also be able to deliver a nasty broadside!Speaking of those troops, you can replenish those troops at stations, and you can hire officers for your own ship to automate some things and make it more efficient. You can also hire mercenaries to fly alongside you, each with their own ships. So, as long as you can pay the salaries of the officers and mercs you hire, you can have a good leg up on some encounters. This also means traders and miners can have escorts, while the combat pilots can have some wingmen, and the fleet leaders can lead the way if they so choose.Trading is pretty straightforward, with each station having commodities in various states of supply and demand, which change from time to time. You can check what's in your cargohold against the last known prices of stations you've visited to gauge if it's worth making the trip. I should also note smuggling is an option, as different sectors have outlawed one thing or another, and you can ""sneak"" illegal goods if you have the right conditions.Overall, I am really happy to have picked this up, and I definitely look forward to exploring everything this game has to offer.

There's a huge map which always has things to do wether you're playing on campaign or freeroam, throughout which there are friends and enemies to trade and fight with. You can mine asteroids for diamonds, you can hijack enemy ships and either sell it or keep it in your garage! You can also upgrade your ship with various weapons and boosters you can even hire ships to follow and defend you.The devs are still updating and ironing out any issues which is nice to hear, but i haven't had a problem with it yet.I'm gunna smash this game once i'm done with divinity.8/10 "

												Amusing and pretty game.  I had fun.  Once I got the hang of capturing ships, the difficulty level dropped.  To be fair, I haven't tried tackling any of the veteran bounties, yet.  I understand that those are considerably more difficult since they will actually put up a fight and deploy counter-measures.The reputation system in this game is very simple: you gain +20 reputation for completing tasks for law-abiding factions and -20 reputation for completing missions for pirate factions.  I would expect reputation gain to drop more significantly and gain more slowly as it does in many other space sim games (e.g. Eve, X3, ...).  As it is, if you're low on cash, simply cap a ship and you'll be back in black.Pro:- Pretty- Lots of ships- Large mapCon:- Not a whole lot of variety or depth.- Different ships don't seem different enough (i.e. play style remains largely the same)- Voice acting is terrible; would have been better without.- Overly simplistic reputation system (see above).

								If you're looking for your EVE Online fix, this is the game for you.  Best of all, it's Single-Player (for now, at least.  Not sure if MP is going to be a thing or not).  No pirate players to come rain on your parade.  No constant worry of whether or not you'll be blown to smithereens when you come out of a gate.  Scan anomalies!  Mine asteroids!  Hunt down the bad guys!  You can do it all.  Had there been a demo for this game for me to try out beforehand, I would have easily paid double its asking price for it.  It's most definitely worth it and more.			"

												Hi GuysUpdated 15th december.After spending sometime into this game heres my review.Pros1) Great graphics and good music.2) Freedom to roam and also a campaign to play. 3) Tons of ships, items to equip your ship.you can hire troopers to board and take over ships! Hire officers and also mercenaries.4)You have missions available at different places where you can accept or reject to earn money and experiences.5) Mods availble for this game.6) You have traits and specials skills as you level.Cons1) Tutorials wordings are too small!!!2) I find it not very user friendly even though the tutorials are there for you. It seems that I struggle for quite some time to get used to it and also the mission chart map seems nto well constructed. To me its not user friendly.3)Something is missing in this game I am not too sure.I will still recommend this game because of the things you can do in the game. Its the freedom to roam. This game is a hit and miss , If you are not sure I will suggest you get it on Sale or bundle. Its much more worth it.			"

												Graphics are good, action is nice, the gameplay smooth and mostly bug free.  In many ways this game does things exactly right.  So why the thumbs down?Because it does one thing wrong and that one thing is enough to drag the rest down with it: It tries to use MMO logic in a single player game.  Which is to say that the grind is the whole of the content.  Do this mission to get credits to get a bigger ship with bigger guns so that you can do a mission with a bigger enemy to get more credits to get an even bigger ship etc etc ad hoc infinitum.  Once you hit max level and get the best ship there really isn't anything left to do except mindlessly blow things up at random.  It gets old really, really quick.Yes there is a story option but the missions in that story are hardly any different than the randomly generated ones from freeroam.  They just add voiceovers to some rather poorly written dialog.Still, the price is cheap and they game is entirely without it's virtues.  It just doesn't have anything to really hold a person's attention for very long.			"

The good: 1. Great platform.  Space, ships, weapons etc. 2. Capturing enemy vessels. The bad: 3. I always seemed to die at the most inopportune times.  Then need to reload and re-traverse the same bits over and over. 4. Storyline is not very exciting.  No animation or something else to give it some life. The ugly: 5. Very repetitive.

The interface is slick, operative and easy to use an understand.  There is a campaign, but my limited time with it just made me hungry for the freeroam mode, as I wanted to be a smuggler or pirate.  What's more the team at LGM is going to keep improving this title in the coming months, and it is likely to become not only a stopgap for ELITE: Dangerous and StarCitizen, but a competitor; and a great one.

								Very fun space sim, very much in the ""Freelancer"" vein.  You get a ship, fly from port to port, buy and sell commodities, mine asteroids or take on freelance missions for fun and profit.  Your ship is upgradeable with an assortment of weapons and buffs available at any port with a drydock; there seems to be a pretty decent variety in the different planetary sytems.  Hiring officers (up to 3, at least on my frigate class) will give you additional buffs; each officer has different strengths, and no two are exacly alike in my gameplay so far. You can add to your fleet by capturing enemy ships after boarding them with your troopers, or do it the old fashioned way, and save up your credits.   Kind of reminds me of ""Eve:Online"", without all the annoying other people! ;)			"

Great Space Opera game with amazing graphics-> Smuggling, fighting, mining, trading, bounty hunting, capturing ship, escorting convoy or attacking space base. -> Nice ship design.-> When you gain lots of credit, you can build a full fleet.-> You can create your own challenge = Being a pirate for exemple and try to be friend with the evil faction is an interesting challenge and a different gameplayThis is not a a space flying simulation as the game is optimized for mouse and keyboard, giving the game a nice tactical touch. It take a bit of time to get used of all the control but once you get them, you can get into amazing space battle : Surviving the  assault of an ennemy fleet on an allied Space station is just so rewarding.Cons :. Voice acting is not great but after sometime you get use to it.. A bit repetitif after a while/lots of grinding needed to buy better ship. . The auto aim make the game to easy in the end while you get a op battle ship.Anyway got lots of hours of fun with it.PS : Something extra to make the planet more lively would be great imo			"

												If, in your gaming memory you remember the classics like ""Freespace"" and ""Privateer"", and loved them, this is the game for you.  The interface is slick, operative and easy to use an understand.  There is a campaign, but my limited time with it just made me hungry for the freeroam mode, as I wanted to be a smuggler or pirate.  What's more the team at LGM is going to keep improving this title in the coming months, and it is likely to become not only a stopgap for ELITE: Dangerous and StarCitizen, but a competitor; and a great one.  I can't recommend this game enough.  You are really in for a treat if you take the time to take the tutorials and just be ready to forge your destiny.			"

												*Gnome Seal of Approval*Don't let the boring tutorial text scare you off if you're new to the genre. It's not as complex of a game as they would have you think. In fact, it's quite easy to learn once you know the basics. I'm new to the genre myself and read comments saying this game is too simple and dumbed down. So if that's true then this game is a good place to start, because I had fun playing the free roam sandbox mode.Lots of stuff to explore. Good controls. Nice visuals. Cool soundtrack.The negative:Earning money is slow until you're strong enough to take on heroes. You'll have a hard time earing enough to buy a new and better ship (which is important). However, once you start killing those heroes for rewards, you will quickly earn more than you need (which in turn feels a little imbalanced).Sandbox mode was a little repetitive. Short framrate drops when the game loads a new area in front of you (which in turn have lead to a crash here and there).If I was to play again, I'd start the story mode instead of the free roam.Cool game!

												so ive never been one for grind games. ive never fully enjoyed the objective of having to do lots of tiny bits to achieve the end goal, but i have to say i thoroughly enjoyed this game. I got the gold pack and have completed both the main story line, soa and of course titans. I find myself actually enjoying the aspect of flying around and stealing ships, taking on fleets and planning my moves. I feel the whole grinding aspect actually pays off when you go from ship to ship and i have to say, personale faves are the baeldor ships. or if you manage to find it the echelon, which is a beast of a ship. overall i love the designs of the ships,  yes the voice acting may be a bit iffy at times but i think it adds to the overall feel of the game, and even though there is a huge grind for ships, the rewards are well worth it. from a novice gamer who never really played these kinds of games i can well and truly say it is money well spent, and i am more than looking forward to warlords.

												To me it's like an arcade X3. Lot earier to get action and jump right into the game, but the trade means nothing in this game and your ""fleet"" is your one ship (and you only can have 1) and a merc you hire. Still fun for a time killer, but I prefer actually doing something that means something to the game like X3 does every second your in.So while there are freighters capable to carrying a good chunk of cargo and yea you do trade, it means nothing. The prices are random so you're selling high and buying low but it doesn't mean anything to the universe around you like X3's chained trade.			"

								Great Space Sim... Developers are always adding new stuff and I can't wait to see where it is going.  EZ flight control, beautiful graphics, and true to self.  I really like the mechanics of the game, much more friendly then X Rebirth yet not to simple to loose interest in.Love to see...- story missions- Missions from NPCs from space (things like, ""engines failed, tow me to station..."" or ""Pirates took my cargo, go get it back for me..."")- crafting- Custom ship building- Named loot drops from destroyed shipsOver all I would say it is a good 20 hours play now but when it is done it will be EPIC "

												KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK HERE GUYS BECAUSE JUST LIKE THAT I HAVE LOST MOST OF MY ATTENTION WITH SWTOR THIS IS A VERY RICH DEEP GAME HERE The flow is nice & you are not that timed on missions or at least not at the point where I am in the game. I have much experience with games of this nature. However, this right here is just nice. The music, the planets, the gear and ships. You definitely got my attention. I'll be honest that I bought the game & never opened it that much because another game here that will go unmentioned really destroyed it for me with games of this format. I recommend this to all who have been disappointed with sandbox/open-world games lately. You will not be disappointed because looks like they actually listened to the players. Hint: if you like the X3 Trilogy with a little of EVE ONLINE then go with this ONE HERE FOLKS. It's no pay to win or confusing irrevelant aspects such as if you run into a friendly target you get penalized in rank. RIGHT ON! FINALLY! Someone actually thinking!			"

												Althought the campaign game was uninteresting, I put 22 hours into the free roam, cruising around to different planets and engaging in space combat. The singleplayer campaign leaves a lot to desired, as the RPG elements are limited, and it is essentially a ""fly here-destroy"" ""fly there"" destory game. I did not get the impression of a complex game, but merely a simplistic space simulator, with very little depth. Worth it for a bargain, and only if you are interested in space sim games that are not too complex or fascinating. Factions only differ in name and equipment, and the presentation is shallow overall.Overall, this does not feel complex and finished enough to reccommend for a full price, but I would recommend buying for  a bargain.

												Since my life is so busy I cant play games much, I come from the angle of a almost n00b to the space sim, free open world games. I always wanted to see space but since our kind is more content sitting on this planet beating each other with sticks I suspect I wont achieve this dream.... So I bought most of the X series and I loved the idea but got so frustrated with the controlls and other nuancses that I probably spent about 4 hours in the last one I bought which was X3. I spent some time on X2 but due to lack of time I just never got into it.If only there was decent space sim that is not so complex I need to study a 1000 page manual to get into it and this certainly proved to be the one I was looking for. Easy to get in but I suspect fiendishly hard to master.Considering this is a brand new games studio I must give them a big 4 little thumbs up(I only have 4 thumbs). The interface is simple and clean. Objectives are forward and to the point. Graphics are great and I spend my time on the mindless train trip between Gordon and Blacktown with my laptop keeping me nice and warm as I just muddle around in the universe.It is a bit grindy at the start as you try and figure how to get to bigger things but overall a very enjoyable experience if you want something really deep but not obscure.Great effort and I am looking forward to what LGM studios brings out next.

												27-Jul-2016 : Finished main story + extrasEquipment : MSI GT80-2QE NotebookREVIEW :First thing first, this is not arcade space sim combat like Elite Dangerous, this is RPG game with space sim combat. You start with a small ship and you can play it like arcade space sim combat since the RPG elements seems irrelevant at the beginning. But as your rank get higher and you get access to bigger ships, you find yourself constantly outnumbered and outgunned. Tactical combat and RPG elements (properly developed character and ship) becomes essential to win a combat.The game is open world. To be powerful enough to progress through the main quest, you can do faction side quests, freelance quests, mining. trading, bounty hunting, pirating and capturing ships. The graphics and soundtrack is great, the story is mediocre with really bad voice acting. This game is not a high budget A-List game, so there's no fancy 3D cutscenes with motion tracking and real voice actors.  The game also really mod-friendly. You can edit stats and even your savegames using a simple text editor. This mod-friendly approach is more handy that it seems. For example, my favorite Carrier-class ship doesn't come with a cloaking device. Easy, edit the ship stats file using Notepad and add the cloaking device myself. There's also Mod Tools to build your own contents. If you're a Trekkie, make sure you try the Star Trek Ship Mods in the Steam Workshop.The developer also generous enough to give a free DLC titled ""Origins"". This free DLC offers 30 storyline missions of the original Starpoint Gemini, re-envisioned and ported to SPG2 engine. So if you never play the 1st one, you can play it now without extra cost. Basically you get 2 games for the price of one.CONCLUSION :Recommended on full price, a must-have on sale price.			"

												I received a press key during the early stages and have had the pleasure of watching the game take shape into what it is today.  The tutorials could still use a bit more work, though the game is a lot of fun once you get a handle on what you're doing.  It's a bit like Freelancer and other like-games in that you can explore different sections of the galaxy, do missions, mine for resource, buy/trade commodities, and so on.  The middle mouse radial menu, coupled with the starchart, makes interacting  with objects a cakewalk.  I still find combat to be a little tough because I have trouble figuring out and observing the available weapon arcs, though you can set the ship on ""fire at will"" and fly around while the computer does all the shooting.  All in all, worth the asking price.

												Only 4 hours into this game and it is wonderfully stable thus far. If you feel a bit burnt by another recently released space game, give Starpoint Gemini 2 a try - I really think you'll like it. If you are a Star Wars fighter jock you'll have to get used to flying a heavier ship. The UI is both intuitive and beautiful. This feels like a sort of dystopian 29th century Star Trek.Edit: Now 15 hours in and this game just keeps getting better all the time. I took down a ""hero"" a.k.a. a large ship with a threat level of ""Impossible."" The fight took 20 minutes and alternating between targeting the enemy's heavy batteries and subsystems. This ship jumped me and was not part of a mission.  My little ship a small Pegasus class gunship wore this bad boy down and the reward was 4 million credits! I decided to step up to a Corsair class rather than an even more powerful Frigate. This is really a game to be savored and frankly, I am so happy with Starpoint Gemini 2 that I really couldn't care less for Elite: Dangerous especially with today's (18 Novemeber) announcement that Elite: Dangerous will require constant online even in single player.You can play this game as you see fit and don't be fooled into thinking that the explorable area is small because there isn't a whole galaxy to explore. I've only seem a tiny part of this game. Somewhere in the Community Hub of this game someone had posted a complete map of the game and suffice to say it is M A S S I V E.Limit Theory is now the only other space game that I think will force me to divide my time if it turns out to be as good as it looks. CNo Man's Sky is still a long way off and Star Citizen is so bloated that I believe it can't possibly live up to the hype nor the budget which I think equals  the budget for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.Simply put, Starpoint Gemini recaptures the magic of the great space games of the past like Indepence War I and II, the Freespace series, and the legendary Tie Fighter and X-Wing and all from a small studio. If you love space games,  get this. Ignore it at your peril.Great job devs! Keep up the great work.			"

												A decent capital ship combat game, but somewhat shallow.Pros:+ A wide variety of ships and equipment+ Combat is a little simplistic but fun nonetheless. Reminds of Rebel Galaxy but offers more control.+ Capturing enemy ships feels satisfying+ Looks good enough. I somehow love the battle hud(blue ring thingie around your ship, appears on some of the screenshots) and miss it in other similar games.Cons:- Probably the worst voice acting in game history. Some voices are really irritiating, especially protagonist's.- Even though all ships are capital ships, you don't feel their scale. For example if you play X3/X:Rebirth, you do feel that your massive capital ship is a massive capital ship. Here all ships are basically the same size and you don't have anything to compare them to.- RPG elements are pretty lame- Story progression is sometimes very confusing. Like you won't have enough crew on your starter ship to capture any other ship (and start earning significant amount of money) or you'll simetimes find that you need 10 more levels to actually pilot a ship you've just earned. Or later in the game I kept getting way more levels than I actually needed.- Limited ship customization options. You can arbitrarily choose any weapons for your ship which's good, but its subsystems are predefined for any given hull and you can just upgrade them slightly via enhancements.- Even though I did rush the game in the end, I have completed it(without DLC stuff) in 32 hours on the hardest difficulty which's a little underwhelming for this kind of games.Grab this game if:You want a little arcadish broadside-style capital ship combat driven by a campaign scenario. Avoid this game if:If you're looking for a very in-depth experience similar to X3/EVE or physically plausible ship controlling similar to Elite. This game has a strong indie feeling to it, don't expect anything of AAA-like scale.My overall rating is 7/10, I did enjoy this game and I'm really looking forward to its successor Starpoing Gemini : Warlords.

Short Version: Grand Space Sim that puts you in command of a space ship to fly, shoot, trade, save the universe, blow up stuff, do the laundry, collect files hidden in floating junk, level up, hire recruits, upgrade your ship, and do pretty much anything else your starfaring heart desires.  The game looks nice, plays well (albeit at a slowish pace), has enjoyably 'space-y' ambient music, and offers a ton of different content that may not always 'wow', but will definitely satisfy.Starpoint Gemini 2 reminds me of a giant, sword-wielding turtle.  No, really! Just let me explain...Waaaay-back-when, in those wonderful 8-32 bit Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle video games, you could play as one of four characters, each with different strengths and weaknesses: Raphael, who had tiny, short-range, but superfast attacks; Donatello who was really slow but could whack-a-ninja from half a screen away with his staff; Michelangelo who specialized in... I don't know, making pizza with nunchucks? Or something?  And then there was Leonardo, who didn't attack quite as fast as Raphael, and didn't have quite the reach of Donatello, and didn't (pizza?) quite as well as Michelangelo - but hey, he was a very close second-best at *everything* and pretty dang awesome as a result.Sooo... if space games were mutant turtles, then Starpoint Gemini would definitely be Leonardo.  Sure, some dedicated RPGs have better character development in stats and story (and DEFINITELY voice-acting), and some starfighters have more intuitive controls without the need for a gazillion tuturial screens and HUD informational windows, and some trading/exploration games have a more lifelike economy that can fully support your character as a pacifist (read: cowardly) trader... but Starpoint 2 offers ALL those types of gameplay and more, and all done extremely well - just not quite on par with the best. This enormous range of solid, enjoyable space-sim content is the essence of Starpoint Gemini 2.All-in-all, SG2 is a huge Space-Based-RPG/Combat/Trading/Strategy/ShipBuilding/Sandbox-Simulator mashup that may be slightly flawed and a bit slow-moving compared to games that 'specialize', however the astonishingly vast scope of gameplay content is all well-done, nicely polished, and most importantly... fun!   With a large campaign and moddable freeplay mode spanning half a dozen genres, Starship Gemini 2 is second-to-none in being second-to-all - but hey, so was Leonardo, and he became the leader of the Ninja Turtles for a reason!(*SIDENOTE:  Despite evidence to the contrary in this review, Raphael was actually the best turtle.  Of course, comparing Starpoint Gemini 2 to a giant mutant *sai*-wielding turtle would have been utterly nonsensical, so I went with Leonardo.) Received a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

												It's a very *loose* yes as a recommendation to play this game. If you can get it on a good sale, then it can be a fairly fun experience running around a small system of planets, doing odd jobs, buying new ships, and upgrading weapons. There's some decent stories involved and the devs have made some nice DLC's available for pretty cheap/free.Downside: this game is buggy as hell when it comes to the control scheme, especially if you want to use a controller with the game. I happen to like using a controller; I feel like it's very relaxing and I can kick back in a chair. Using an Xbox One controller with this game, (or any controller) is going to lead to a hell of a lot of mapping issues that don't get resolved easily. Also, loading up the DLC's can be kind of weird, since you're selectively activating them. Unlike games like Skyrim, where you can just roll up and jump into a DLC once you add it to your game with whatever save file you're using, this game like to cordon off the DLC's and have you jump sandbox to sandbox. They can be fun, but it's not always ideal. That all being said... there's a ton of ships in this game and ways to arm them out. Whatever your playstyle, you'll eventually captain a ship that meets your needs, whether that be overwhelming destructive force, a carrier that houses a fleet, or a ship that can drop out of stealth and put the hurt on. It can be pretty addictive. It can ALSO be extrememly repetitive. You mileage may vary!Final Verdict: yes, I'd recommend this game, but it really will appeal only to a specific type of gamer.			"

												This game is great if you want a single player RPG and to run around in space.  The free roam is cool but gets old, and the story gives you purpose but it is limited.  This GAME WOULD BE EPIC if it had multiplayer support.  If you could build a fleet with real humans and maybe go raid someone that might be able to apply a little bit of strategy.  The biggest drawback is that it is linear, you want to beat someone get some better guns... or a bigger ship, thats it.  Buy a long range weapon and you can literally just tease the AI until they are dead waiting out of there auto combat range, attacking them and backing off when they chase so they start all over.

The variety is a bit lacking, but the gameplay is pretty solid.A few caveats: (2 Days after Release) - In it's current form, balance is an issue, some activities are far more profitable than others. - Enemies scale in difficulty based on your level, it's possible to earn too much experience and not enough money to prevent yourself from being anihillated by everything. - Some technical issues remain (Framerate is locked at 30FPS, Some graphics options are disabled. Crashes are rare but occur.)TLDR: If you loved freelancer, and want more of the same, you'll probably enjoy this. Don't expect anything revolutionary, however.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 makes for a pretty enjoyable space sim experience, but it is very lacking in depth.  It tries so hard to give you the complexity one desires in a space sim with features like capturing ships using marines, scanning anomalies, and coming across derelicts just waiting to be scavenged, but in the end, these activities are very superficial.  They eventually become very routine and the rewards are often limited to money or experience.  Levelling up your character doesn't grant much satisfaction, except for when a perk point is given.Not much is required before you'll be rocking around Gemini in the biggest ship the game has to offer, decked out with the biggest guns, with all the best upgrades.  Luckily, this doesn't make you the ultimate end-all-be-all combat god of the universe.  Combat appears to be balanced in such a way that you will always be vulnerable and dealing with this turns out to require very different strategies depending on the size of your ship.Combat is one of the things this game does very well, and a challenge always awaits you as the game throws squadrons of enemies at you routinely, even the periodic Legendary or Hero ship, which offers an even greater challenge and huge money rewards for the latter.Otherwise, this game seems like a pretty casual space sim.  You will get plenty of enjoyment out of it, but you won't get invested in it like you'd like, which makes the sub-40 dollar price tag perfect for the experience it offers.			"

												Some intial problems with the game almost made me eat my own scowling face with rage. For serious, it took four tries just to make it launch and once it did launch it took two restarts to make it launch without messing its big boy pants. Finally, I got into the game, started playing, and immidiately strangled myself with my own mouse cable. This will happen, don't panic. Just unwrap yourself or, if you have to, find an adult to help. At first the controls feel as stable as a drunken donkey with the skurvy, at least with a mouse. I flopped around for quite a while, but eventually not only was I flying circles around the bad guys, I was...no, I was just flying circle cause that's how I dodge enemy fire while keeping my guns trained on them. The point is the flopping became on purpose, cause stragedy; now the controls seem alright to me. The map is roughly six times bigger than something really, really big (a house, a small country, yo momma, etc.). It's big, like hugemongous. Think of something really big, and then know that this is much bigger. The game has two modes: Campaign and Freeroam, although a Campaign save can abandon the story to go chase space squirrels once you realize that space rodents are much more interesting. I played the Campaign for about an hour, then made a new character in Freeroam who is a morbidly obese, one-eyed robot smuggler with a ship so fast that no one has thus far been able to catch it and I regret absolutely nothing. Freeroam is why you buy this game. Freeroam will consume you. I have accepted that this game is my new family, and you must too. Don't fight it. Let Space Daddy carry you away in his big, strong hands. Shhhhhh..... 8/10			"

												Bought this game not that long ago and i have had a blast. Simple yet hard and fun combat, the focus of the game is on large capital ships instead of fighters something i like very much, it makes you feel like a proper captain. Awesome ships designs and graphics. The game gives you tons of freedom to to what you want to do, you want to be a pirate go ahead, trader sure, miner or a bounty hunter have at it. The game has one of the best and most active dev team i have seen, they activly talk with their gamerbase and activly put in new features and ideas in the game. This game is going to evolve alot and they are planing many more awesome features. Its a very good game and a must buy for folk that like space games.Gameplay 8/10Atmosphere 8/10Music 8/10Graphics 9/10Replayability 8/10Overall 8/10			"

												This game is a TRUE open world space RPG. I really love this game, despite is few shortcomings.Freedom: Full freedom to do whatever you want, wherever you want, whenever you want is why this game is great. You can become a full time miner and collect minerals, you can ferry goods from station to station and trade for money, you can capture enemy ships and DRAG them back to your base to sell. Combat: Perhaps the best part of this game is the combat system. It is really like a 3d dogfight in space ships. Do not expect a true space physics, but the combat system is one of the most fun I have played. You actually fly the ship yourself and shoot the weps yourself. Direct full energy to shields to survive, weps to destroy, or engines to run like hell!RPG: You gain levels as you go. You can kill ships for small XP or do missions for more XP. You can level up each of your 4 special skills, get bonuses to your ""profession"", and buy new ships at higher levels, each with their own special traits.Glitches: I have had about 10 full crashes in 24 hours of playtime. I have many out of memory errors when I still have lots in task manager, although the game still runs, for a while... In game glitches are more frequent but less noteworthy.			"

								This is a great game. Like all space sim/action/whatever, it takes a little to get comfortable with all the controls. There is so far only one real thing I'd change. There is a sense of ""I'm never ever gonna be able to afford that..."". The experience gained from freelancer missions is way too freaking small, and the upgrades to weapons are insanely expensive, not to mention I have no real idea how much of a boost they are giving me, because the data doesn't have % signs or adjustments shown.So really, it's a great game. Period. It seems like it would never end really, which is great. But I still have no sense of how long it will take to get to higher levels, because right now I'm level 3 (so like 6300/9000 points to next level) and each of these freelancer missions gets me like 50 freaking points! So I'm asuming never.I know I am just griping about that over and over, but that's it, that's the only drawback. Other than that, it has everything you want in a space RPG. Exploring, mining, upgrading, fighting (which is pretty hard, but really fun), assassinations, etc.			"

												4/5I´ve been looking for a game that resembles one of my old favorites, Freelancer so when I found this I got very excited.Sat down, launched the campaign and boy did I smile once I had it all set up and flew through space on my way to my first mission. Gonna try to list some of the pros and cons belowPros+ Nice graphics+ Awesome soundtrack (seriously, I leave the game running when I go to bed)+ Lots of ships+ Select between campaign and Freeroam and choosing the first won´t stop you from doing the roaming freely.+ Many different factions+ Huge map+ Really nice controls once you get the hang of them+ Active devs, seen them post in the steam forums many times+ Many different ways to make money in-game+ Rare drop blueprints+ Achievements+ Many difficulties (only tried normal)Cons- The voice acting in the campaign lacks feeling- Sometimes it´s impossible to target things by clicking on them (think it might be a bug cause if you click on something else and then try again, it works). No real problem though since it´s uncommon and you can always use quickbinds for targeting stuff.- I´ve had a few crashes since I bought it but since the game is being actively patched (and I haven´t crashed for a few days) it might have already been fixed or I feel confident they'll fix it.- Might get a little repetitive after a whileHaving played it quite a lot the past weeks I'd say it's one of my best purchases in a long time and it deffinitly deserves a strong 4!1 - Crap, don't buy2 - Fun for an evening3 - It's an alright game but not my taste4 - Great game5 - One of the best I've ever played			"

								Only clocked in around 7 hours so far but woa... i am blown away.. even in alpha stage this game just shows an great potential and already nicely working elements such as capturing ships. You earn you money the way you want! nothing is forced as of now you can even flee or just ignore enemy ships... to be honest i think and hope that i found what i am looking for in a space game... but enough of me talking here is what i love and hate in it:Pro: Gorgeous graphics,       Random Events       lots and lots of different ships to fight/fly       large map to explorecons: occasional frame drops (dusty asteroid field on the first spawn point... for me thats a brute videocard killer :D)         Controls might be tricky (i use gunner view all the time while flying with keyboard its fine this way for me)         alpha... i ignore the small bugs and stuff that are a usual visitor to ALL alpha stage games so ... yup         occasional small lock ups (1-2 sec) when an event/area is loading (but i kinda think this is only for me and my rather                        weak pc)Buy: If you want a very good space Single Player RPG and if you have the patience and nerves for an alpha (meself i did not encounter any huge bug and only had game crash one times so far)Dont Buy: if you are afraid of Alpha's (there is nothing wrong with that its totally acceptable) and if you are inpatient for them.9/10 for me (-1 is due to some lag issues I encounter)			"

								30 mins in and its pretty good so far, reminds me of a old Star Trek game I used to play where you can control the ship tactically and space combat is not all arcade dog fighting-like. Though the world is still layed out like most star trading games, IE- standard trading of goods from A-B, scanning stuff, fighting pirates and griding. Prices for upgrades and ships seem rather steep for the rewards given for quests, hopefully they get that figured out because that seems to be a exessive amount of grinding. Combat, navigation, and controls are really intuitive (played the first one since it was free and its controls are aweful) skiped the pop-ups and just jumped in. One suggestion that would be nice is thet able to attack the ports in space, as of now you can target but nothing connects and you can fly right through them. You would probably lose but its no fun without the option.			"

								I've been looking for a game like Freelancer for years because I've loved how it was open-ended and how you could do anything you wanted, apart from having huge ships. This game however does everything Freelancer did and more. You can have huge ships if you want, you can have a fleet of ships and you can get gigantic ships with the mods. There's already a titan class ship mod. The game deserves at least 9/10 from any and all aspects. Yes there are bugs and yes some missions aren't completed and yes there is no campaign mode or multiplayer, but the sandbox is more than enough. Keep in mind that this is early access and they are going to add a campaign mode.This was what I was looking for. This game deserves to be played and loved.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game I've been following for a long time, hoping for a game that would dethrone Freelancer from its rightfull place. So far things look good and this might even be the case in the future, but as of now there's still plenty of work to be done. That doesn't mean SG2 wouldn't feel good to play. Does it?The game features a rather large open area The Gemini Star System. It's filled with stations, shipyards, bases, asteroid fields, junkyards, enemy ships, friendly ships, planets, anomalities, practically everything you would expect from a sandbox-type space game. It feels like there's a lot to do out there but at least for me that's not the case. This is because the game features very few different types of missions for the moment. There are freelance missions which you'll accept over the map view and then start them by docking with the correct facility, ship or planet. These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.The game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain. You control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target. In combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at. The combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy ""above"" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.The GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a ""minimalist"" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.Overall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.			"

												Edit: This was a review of the EARLY ACCESS! This does not reflect the new content added in the update, but once I play the retail version enough, I will be sure to update!For a while I have been looking for a good open-world space game, with nothing really looking like a decent game. For me, spore is the most experience with a space-style game, which I really loved, but I wanted to move on to better things. Then I saw Starpoint Gemini 2 in development. After watching some videos and seeing how fantastic the game looked, I decided to buy it, which was an excellent decision and one that I recommend anyone reading this review to follow.Little more needs to be said about the visuals. They are fantastic. Combat is also really well done, and content is surprising since it is still in development and only has one gamemode so far. The most disappointing thing about this game for me was that there is no option to actually explore planets. This is purely a space exploration game, which of course is why the price is not rediculously high and is very reasonably priced especially for a game so modern that it is still in development. That limitation is really the one thing which is keeping this from being my dream game, but it is definitely fantastic for what it was designed for. Just make sure to dock whenever possible so that you can save and not lose a ton of progress!Overall, I definitely recommend this game whether you are new to the space scene or a veteran. Especially at this price point, it is an excellent buy!			"

												A very good space game, enjoyable in freeroam and the story mode seem pretty interesting. The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.(And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			"

												Great game and great customer support!SPG2 is not a Flight-Sim like the X-Games... its more likley a point and click and Flight-Sim Hybrid.Point and Click components are implemented in the following game Mechanics:- Targeting- Special Skills- Shooting (Auto Aim and Auto Fire [Optional you can aim and shoot by yourself but the controls are not really made for this])Flight sim:- Evasive Manuveurs - OutmanuveursAs you can see is the Focus on the Point and Click elements. Personaly  i would like to play this game as an pure Flight-Sim but the controls are right now just to clumsy (Mouse Aim is a little bit hard to master and flying with joystic will lead into big disadvantages because you will have massive problems to rotaet those turrets (Nearly all Weapons are turrets).But the Game is still in Progress and the Devs are very active in the steam forum and try to help there costumers nearly in every single thread that is posted.

												I've had Starpoint Gemini 2 since Early Access, but I didn't know how to play it. Only a couple of days before release from beta did I start watching YouTube videos on how to play it and since then I've been having quite a bit of fun with it. I'm hooked. Right now, I'm ten hours into the game playing Freeroam; I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of this huge game. I kinda like how I can go in-game if I have some time over and just do a couple of quick missions, while, if I want to play for longer, I can do long trips to the end of the galaxy that will take hours and involve lots of exploration and combat. It's beautiful, it's fun and it's satisfying. I like Freeroam mode, but there's also a storyline mode. The modding is going to be awesome. Watch out for some big total conversions for this one! Also, the community and developers are really friendly.			"

								First off I'd like to say that I can't recommend this game or not, its still in its development without a storyline yet. It has a lot of potential but also a lot of stuff to work on. Much of what the others have said is absolutely right. The money/combat balance system is so wonky at the moment. There have been times I fought 2 'impossible' ships and knocked them out almost immediately, and then 3 'trivial' ships have taken me down a little while later. Using manual aiming is a massive handicap because you can only fire from a few turrets at a time and trying to lead a ship is next to impossible at many ranges. I have yet to come across another gun, light or heavy, that is stronger than the ones I started with.The skills and perks are lackluster at best, you start with all the skills and simply increase the efficiency slightly. Every five levels you get a perk, and again, that just adjusts your efficiency with one thing or another, 8% more money when trading, or 8% more damage with railguns, etc. Very uninspired stuff. And then the money, over the course of a week I got about a million, which isn't enough for any ship. Then when I get to a particular station I kill a bounty without even realizing the ship was one. After selling at the station, I get another bounty, and another. In the course of an hour I get 17 million and can pretty much afford whatever I want, except I can't fly much at the level I'm at.All in all it is a game on the cusp of having something really good going for it. There's a lot of potential here and I'll continue to play and explore because I do find it entertaining.			"

These missions usually involve hauling passangers or goods from the dock point to another. There are also scanning, repairing, patrolling and I think I even saw an assassination mission. These might keep you busy for a while but the samey repeating content of each mission type quickly lose their charm.The game's main emphasis is on space combat which for the most parts feels good. Ships fly in space and trade fire with missiles, beam weapons, plasma and railguns. Fighters fly out from the bigger ships and engage the enemies and boarding parties can devastate the enemy ships from within. You can fire manually or tell the game to target and fire on the target for you. I find this helpful since handling the ship in combat can be a real pain. You control your ship through two different control mechanics. The default one uses WASD to steer the ship while the mouse is used to target, shoot and activate buttons on the GUI. The second method is using the mouse to steer the ship. The ship turns along your mouse movement much the same way the default steering in Freelancer was handled. I prefer the former method in this game since using the mouse flight feels overly sensitive and I can't seem to make the ship fly straight or stay on target. In combat you also have to keep your ship from taking damage and face the stronger shield at your enemy while also focusing on distributing fire from your weapons evenly enough so you can have a sustained stream of fire at the target. I'm not sure if this is the intended way to fight but I've found it effective. You can also enter the turret view to move the camera and aim targets around your ship freely, this helps you to shoot targets your ships is not directly facing at. The combat is fairly entertaining, although like I mentioned above, steering the ship can be difficult and the default camera angle isn't helping much. When you need to fly on target it seems you have to place the target somewhere above your ship, close to the top edge of your screen. This is the actual direction the ship is moving towards to and it might take a while to get used to that. Also because of the odd camera angle I often had to keep the enemy ""above"" my ship to be able to fire the majority of my weapons at it. This just feels wrong, at least to me.The GUI is what really bothers me the most. It's overly colourfull, oddly clunky and the sound effects are horrendous. I have a tendency to go for a ""minimalist"" kind of look when it comes to user interfaces and such. In this game the UI makes me think of children toys, the large plastic kind with full of teeth marks and bright flashy colours. Actually, now that I think of it, the overall design and look of the game is overly shiny and gleamy. The ship designs could also be a tad more imaginative. Even the large battleships just look and feel like one-man fighter crafts even though they are supposed to be much larger than that.Overall the game has potential to be extremely entertaining. I like it so far even if the things I mentioned above might feel a little harsh. I've got great expectations for this game, although experience has taught me not to, but I can't help it. I'm longing for a good space combat/sim/whatever that has the feel and openness of Freelancer.			"

												A very good space game, enjoyable in freeroam and the story mode seem pretty interesting. The only thing bugging me about the game is the frequent pauses and stutters whilst flying through zones - the game will literally stop for a second, at first it didn't bother me but since starting the story mode the pausing seems to stand out more and has become a pet hate. Going to wait for a few updates and hopefully this will get cured, not sure I can finish the game whilst this is an issue.I'm going to recommend the game because it is a really fun game, if these pauses get cured it will be really enjoyable, and I do think it will be cured because the devs have been doing a great job.(And before anyone blames my spec for the pauses - I'm using a i7 4770K, 16GB ram, GTX 770 and the game is running from a 3TB WD black.)

												This game can be summed up as a modern day Freelancer, but with capital ships instead of fighters. It shares many similarities with the aforementioned game, as well as some enjoyable improvements, and will probably be the best single player Freelancer-style space sim available for a good while. With Star Citizen focused on multiplayer, look no further than Starpoint Gemini 2 to fill the gap between the two.Like Freelancer, you can play with keyboard and mouse, with a rather familiar flight control style to Freelancer players. But although SG2 offers support for other gaming controllers, it's far from polished right now - it's near-enough unplayable with the popular Saitek X52 HOTAS, given the rediculous deadzone on all axes. However, if anything, the keyboard and mouse feels more natural to use in this game anyway, given you're playing the role as a ship (and later, fleet) commander.Comparing this game to the failure that was X-Rebirth, SG2 comes out on top. Although more arcady, SG2 is significantly more enjoyable from the getgo.			"

												I really love the game, the open world and freedom to do what I want is so simple yet nobody seems to ever give the true freedom of choice that I want in a space game. I'm really happy with it. I only have one complaint and a two suggestions. For the complaint, and it may be something on my end, I'm experiencing a lot of crashes, still worth it to reload every hour or so though. As for a suggestion, I love the open world sandbox feel, however a more effective fast travel would be nice. My second suggestion would be to work in some speaking graphics of an alien or human pirates or whoever is talking when I recieve a message from somebody in the upper left cornet within the exploration game. I just feel like it would be more engaging with that.			"

												Very enjoyable, a bit rough around the edges.Even with a few issues (voiceover audio not playing, no docking animations, navigation issues when you hit go-to when you're next to a station you've docked at, etc.) this game is very, very fun.Unlike the space sims before it (Freelancer) and the modern ones coming out (Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen) which focus on the mechanics of a more agile fighter, Starpoint Gemini 2 focuses much more on a capitol ship feel. You're not a lone pilot darting through space in a dogfight, you're sitting at the helm of a Carrier, deploying fighters, and watching your crew unload your ship's payload. Power management is stressed, as is the use of powers and items that bolster shields, shut down enemy systems, etc. One thing I love about this game which I have not yet seen in another space sim is the ability to send your troops over to capture another ship. This happens to be one of the best ways to make money, and is extremely fun.Unfortunately it doesn't give you any experience (which seems a little peculiar, considering it's an integral part of many people's strategies), but the payout is fantastic.All in all, worth buying, though I haven't played it since Elite: Dangerous came out lol			"

												I gotta say ever since the Star Trek Star Fleet Command series of games I was always looking for something close.I found Starport Gemini and it quickly grew on me. It has many of the elements the former Star Trek games had, Ship command, 360 degree views, power management, repair, officers, ability to go anywhere in the galaxy, trading. The great thing aboiut Starport Gemini 2 is it improves on all that with 360 degree freedom of the camera and space maneuvering. Its no longer 2d in that regard. Even in beta it feels polished compared to the earlier game. I can't wait for the campaign to come and I do hope someone makes a mod so us girls can play as female in it. I give the Game 4 stars out of 5 as is.Big thuumbs up.			"

								I've been looking for a game like Freelancer for years because I've loved how it was open-ended and how you could do anything you wanted, apart from having huge ships. This game however does everything Freelancer did and more. You can have huge ships if you want, you can have a fleet of ships and you can get gigantic ships with the mods. There's already a titan class ship mod. The game deserves at least 9/10 from any and all aspects. Yes there are bugs and yes some missions aren't completed and yes there is no campaign mode or multiplayer, but the sandbox is more than enough. Keep in mind that this is early access and they are going to add a campaign mode.This was what I was looking for. This game deserves to be played and loved.			"

								Wow! I have played a lot of Freelancer over the years and always looked forward to a second comming if you will. With the recent surge in SciFi games I have tried my chances with a few and been let down (X-Rebirth I am looking at you). However this game keeps the syplicity of Freelancer with ideas from today. Honestly it really takes the best from Star Trek Online and Freelancer in that it allows you to be what you want but gain levels along the way with a pretty good skill tree. I really enjoy the freedom to do what you want combined with an RPG element. That way I actually feel like I am getting somewhere. Ordinarily I would wait to post a review however with these types of games I can usually tell if I will like them based on my love of Freelancer (hence the constant name drop). This game also has a full workshop so there is the possibility of endless content. There are already Star Trek mods and I am sure that more are to follow. All in all, if you need to scratch the Freelancer itch and you are tired of waiting for Robert's new game, please try this one. For the price it really cannot be beat.			"

Lots of side missions available  but no side line stories or quests as of yet i assume these will come with the main quest . Although there are a abudance of different factions and ship and enhancements available easily enough to keep you going for a long time . There are also a large ammount of mods avaiilable throught the steam workshop which yet another dimension to the game especially if you like blowing things up with very big guns . I would fully recommend this game it has provided me with hours of entertainment and many more to come  during my play i have encountered no gliches or freezes to date  and all seems well .

I see them answering questions in almost every quistion topic here on steam, and they are active on their own forumes as well.I have heard the original Starpoint Gemini was not that good (I have not played it myself), and if that is so: do not fear, this game, even in alpha, is very enjoyable.

												Alright. So...Downsides:1. There's a Commander class that benefits fleet and the best you can do for a ""fleet"" is hire 2 mercenaries later in the game.2. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. And it takes forever to get anywhere even with the PTE speed.3. First 4 campaign missions are travels (you kill like 2 ships) that take 5mins of travel time each if you don't get sidetracked. (Haven't gotten further yet)4. When mining, debris containing your precious loots flys everywhere faster than your ship moves, slowing the process.Upsides:1. The map is THE BIGGEST FREE ROAM I'VE EVER SEEN. I've spent almost 6 hours trying to open 10% of the map up. I've explored basically none of it, but now I know where the faction structures are for a little bit of a corner of a section of the map.2. Auto-aim from Open Fire actually leads the target instead of dicking around with straight shots based on current location. Awesome job.3. The ship types are easy enough to learn and yet there are enough of them to still have a good enough variety.4. Graphics are decent.5. You mine the same way you fight. By blowing ♥♥♥♥ up with your weapon systems.6. The ship you start with is more than enough to ♥♥♥♥ around and get work done for a while (so far all I had to replace was the weapon system).7. Enemies spawn/warp in often enough you don't have to explore to find cargo to sell. And they won't persue you fast enough that you can get away fairly quickly without much worry. 8. The radar/scanner/mini-map is easy to understand as long as you're not a brick.9. Middle Mouse Button is your friend.10. Controls take a minute to get used to during combat, but you'll pick it up pretty quick since you just have to worry about positioning/dodging instead of aiming your light weapons.11. There's still a challenge when you're fighting in big fights.10/10 worth my money and time so far. Haven't played far into the campaign but I'll see how that goes, also. Awesome first empression and I definitely suggest dicking around in freeroam instead of starting with the campaing to figure stuff out, then turning off tutorials in campaign for a smoother ride.

												I'm not sure how to review this one. There are some issues that I have with it that are just hallmarks of past space sims. So if you hate typical downsides of space sims, then this game doesn't really break that barrier. If you're not a fan of classic space sims, then this game doesn't deliver much outside of that. But first off, I got this game when it was 80% off 2 years after it released. I got it primarily to scratch that never-ending itch of playing a worthwile space sim while waiting for Star Citizen to be a more complete game. My review is about the base game with its base story missions and content.The main campaign is a revenge story of a son wanting justice for his dad's murder, but like past sci-fi games it quickly evolves into you saving the whole world or in this case a solar system. Cliched, I know, but I won't spoil it. The story likely took me about 8 hours to complete which I expected for a game like this. Like previous space sims before it, it allows you to do whatever you want and start any mission you want after the initial mission without an artificial lock like you need to be level X to do mission Y. Personally, I like that in open world games. There are supposedly 13 non-story mission types that are randomly generated on the map, but depending on your ship these missions can range anywhere from super easy or downright impossible. That was my first problem with this game. The randomly-created missions support the grindiness aspect of the game, and the rewards often feel lackluster even after progressing so far into the game. When you've done one ferry mission or security mission, you've done them all. There's no variation in each mission type. Just a difference in NPC ship difficulty. That's where problem 2 comes in.You can mine asteroids, crystals, and pockets of gas in certain sectors of the map that will reward you depending on the market value and how big your cargo hold can take. After getting the ship with the most cargo capacity and mining said sectors, the tediusness and grindiness settles in quick. If you like that aspect of space sims, where grinding = bigger and better ship then this is right up your alley. If not, then look elsewhere. Personally, after ~50 some hours of mining, salvaging, bounty hunting, raiding commercial ships and stations, escorting/protecting/rescuing NPCs and scanning space anomalies, I feel like this game scratched that itch. I can't say I enjoyed the whole grind experience, but I did feel satisfaction upon earning one of the best ships in the game. Once you get past the tedium and set up a ship goal, hours did fly for me by working up the reputation and credits to earn it. If you expect not to grind for a better ship, then expect to mod the game or not get the game at all.The leveling system is typical with missions giving you x amount of credits and experience points. You use these points to level up different abilities for one of three chosen classes (commander, gunner, engineer) that activate in-game to give your ship better stats momentarily like faster speed, more weapon damage, faster shield regeneration, etc. The reputation system is binary where doing missions for X faction will yield Y rep points and -Y rep for the opposing faction. You can side with ""bad"" factions, stay lawful/chaotic neutral, or side with ""good"" factions. I chose to be lawful good throughout the game, like a good boy scout that I try to be irl. Siding with either faction will either open or close certain planets and stations which will lock you out of a certain achievement if you're not neutral. It's a lot harder to stay neutral because the story doesn't let you choose outcomes and there aren't enough non-story missions that will help keep you neutral. So what's my problem with this? The leveling system on top of the grindy non-story missions really does show how tedius this game can get. It doesn't really get better once you reach your ship goal. I'm still left with the same missions and rewards that don't scale as much as I wanted it to.You'd think that once you're Commander Badass with a Dreadnought, fighter ships you can deploy and merc ships you can hire, that you'd be making bank by melting everything in sight with your plasma cannons. Nope. I still have to mine/salvage/scan/trade ad infinitum to make serious money. Having a bigger ship does help with not dying every 10 minutes or so from seemingly random incursions with other giant ships, often multiple giant ships to contend with. That's another problem I have with this game. NPC ships that scale from a trivial threat to impossible come out of nowhere at random times. Even when you're technically in safe sectors of space, NPCs that are against your faction (which to me is every bad guy in the game) will spawn or decloak out of nowhere and proceed to tear you a new one very early in the game, until you have one of the best ships then you can go toe to toe with one of them. If dying repeatedly due to random incursions regardless of where you are in the map isn't your thing, then that's a big problem. I get it, space is dangerous and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s can be anywhere in the vast emptiness of space. But if I'm 10 seconds away from the good guys Navy fleet, you'd think that pirates and marauders wouldn't go that close and tear you a new one. If/when I create a chaotic evil character save, I will update this review to reflect my experience being on the other side of the law.One aspect I failed to use in this game before this review are mods from the Steam workshop. They range from quality of life mods (better loot, more damage, faster speed) to custom assets in game (ships, stations, missions, etc.) to total conversions, so fellow Star Trek fans will be able to scratch that itch.I'd like to say that after ~60 hours of playing this game, I will recommend it to fans of classic space sims with the caveat that there is a space sim grind to it and that it doesn't hold your hand. If you're looking for a revolutionary game that breaks the typical downsides of space sims, then please look elsewhere. If you know that you want to scratch that classic space sim itch with the understanding of the problems that I've explained above, then I do recommend this game to you.			"

												Da. Best. And that is an exact measurement.  Starpoint Gemini 2 successfully brings the open world 3D single player RPG to space.  Some may say that sprpg is past its prime but SG2 didn't get that memo because this game doesn't feel dated at all and includes all the modern accessories like side quests, an engaging story, lots of skills and ranks and points to customize your character, hireable mercenaries, customizable ships (oh yea), and some awesome new stuff to make you feel like you are not only piloting, but commanding a fleet.  I played this game a lot during early access and I said then that this game had the potential to be awesome if executed correctly and man was it ever!  On top of all that your ship is a whole character of its own with everything from frail gunships to massive carriers that can cloak themselves and launch entire fighter wings from their carrier bays! I would recommend this game to anyone who has suffering in the drought of good space games and anyone who enjoys rpgs.  Oh and [name redacted] this isn't Eve, you get to shoot the guns and do stuff.			"

								It's a good space RPG, that has a few bugs, still but only minor ones. the ship customizing is, good idea,  and the ships are a fair size, with combat skills, the turning rate, still needs some work.  combat pretty basic, missle weapons and beam, weapons, just need to upgrade, them.  For the overall of the game, u get more, from hunting down emenies, but still can make  some pretty good, coin, in the trading system, just have to find a trade. route, that will pay more, for ur buying items. at the stations.  Missions are good, since u need them to build ur rep, with the sector's  and regions of the game.  But don't do any missions that take u into a hostile, Base. really bad idea.  As for Rateing this game, would be 8/10.  Not a bad game to have.			"

												Well for $35 I have enjoyed this game. There are aspects of this game that are in need of improvements. Specifically: the point of view difficulties with turret mode, fixing balancing issues with mission level and mission difficulty, sudden explosion of ship which occurs randomly for no apparent reason either in combat or not, and a revamping of the money making process as capturing ships is the only effective way to progress due to missions and mining not being profitable enough to support ship progression. I have only played the freeroam with a starting zero reputation mod. I have played Rebel Galaxy before purchasing this game and found this game to be different and not necessarily better than Rebel Galaxy. There is more that is different than the same between the two games.			"

												Alreet peeps, so this is my experience shot and review. So first things first id like to recommend this title and hope you enjoy it as much as i did.  This however will just be a general impression not a rating or in depth review.Reasons : I'm coming from the original Starpoint Gemini and really enjoyed it for its single player freelancer style of gameplay. I picked it up in early access which i dont usualy go for but due to my experience with the original i toke a chance, this was not a mistake though as the title has come along way since i originaly purchased this.Graphical: not cutting edge but still a really good looking game. fx to physics all of which are well made and are still being refined even after full release.Sound assets : I have no ear for sound effects but they where up to standard, no odd sounds that ruined the experience.Performance : Runs great. I dont have a uber rig, i run a very avarge system and this game runs great even in larger battles.Content: A good solid campaign backed up with a freeroam mode that allows you to strip away the main story and play the universe in the way you want to. So many ships that you wont get to fly them all in one play through i reckon even with a few play throughs you will find some new ship to fly, some new mission and or enemy to beat up on. Also the ability to play as a peace keeper or as a bandit.faults : no borderless window mode and lack of a multiplayer.Overhall: Solid singleplayer title that if you like freelancer / startrek online / x3 then your gonna be at home with this title. Defo pick this up and i pretty sure you will enjoy whats here and whats coming in the future as the team behind this is great and im sure this game can only get better.Update- the original games campaign reto fitted into this game for free!, why cant all develpers do this. Perfect actualy prefect.Stay Frosty			"

												This game has lots of flaws, but I like it so much since it's the game i've been looking for a long time.PROS:-Absolutely beautiful, the way the binary stars cast shadows on asteroids, to the way distant nebulae appear giant and intimidating-Most of the locations you see in space are reachable-Great soundtrack-You can be what you want, a pirate, trader, privateer, whatever-Lots of ships-Lots of modules and countless ways to setup your loadout-For a space game, the environment is extremely varied-Boarding and stealing a ship feels damn good-MODDING!!!!!1111111!!11MIXED:-Probably just me, but the trading and interface feel to simple; after playing EVE Online for so long, the UI feels like it needs more-The active ability RPG portion feels tacked on, I find myself almost always autofiring; at least never using my 1-4 keys-Sometimes the autopilot glitches out and it's hilarious; I like to think of it as a feature-Doesn't have SLI support, unless forced through a third party program like NVidia inspector or even just the control panel. However, once you do force it, it runs really nice (minus some annoying microstuttering).CONS:-The downscaling of the universe is really obvious and weird-Things pop in a lot, like anomalies and stations-Bad sound effect design, especially in weapon firing sounds-Inconsistant graphics, some things are really highly detailed while others look like they came out of a 2006 game-Missions get repetitive, and if you strip all the lore and factions away, all the gameplay is literally the same, minus enemies getting tougher over timeCool game, go buy, shoot ships in the face.

												It's fun and pretty. Look away if you want the depth of EVE and X3 or the simulation part of Elite. You won't find that here.

												I haven't played this game for too long but it has proven to be very fun and challenging.  I am currently playing through the campaign but I am also conducting side missions.  The side missions include (from what I have seen so far): assassination of trouble makers, repairing installations, bounty hunting, and transporting VIPs. I mine asteriods and trade at stations frequently to balance my finances.  Capturing and selling enemy starships have proven to be the most lucrative transaction.  Combat is somewhat confusing at first but the games excellent tutorial guide and fully customizable control menu is very helpful.  Pros:-Good graphics.-Intense space combat.-Can easily change viewing settings - Rudder control""bridge"" view, Rudder control third person view, and turret third person view.-Ability to purchase and upgrade several starships.-Can hire mercs and form a fleet. -Large open world to explore.-Many unique ways to ""jump""around the map e.g. rifts and wormholes.-Story is ok.-Background music is pretty good and varied.Cons:-No NPCs to interact with at space stations.-No first person perspective.-No ship interior perspective. Mixed:-Fairly steep learning curve to become proficient with all of the games functions.Overall a great indie title!  Give your self lots of time to play this game...it is hard to quit this game for the night!			"

												I always was fan of space games, but most of them are meh at the best. The only that I TRULY liked A LOT were X3 (all 3 of X3's), EVE Online, FTL, and Space Pirates and Zombies. To be honest, I expected Stairpont Gemini 2 to be just meh, but it came on sale. Quickly calculated the cost in my currency, and decided to give it a shot anyway.It might not be one of those I love the most, but certainly it's not meh either. It's actually pretty good. I am enjoying it.It sure has it's flaws, but it sure is fun to play. I see it as kind of mix of Freelancer/X3 with EVE Online. For sure, I don't regret spending money on it - and it doesn't happen a lot.			"

												There is a very important tip in this review! If you're going to get this game, you better read on.I tried to return this game after five hours of trying to make enough money to even by the next better laser in order to break the asteroids faster.  And, I can tell you I'm very happy that I passed the hours played deadline for returning it! This really is a quite fun game if you know the right way to make money!  If you think you're going to make money trading or mining, you got another thing coming! Forget about anything except capturing enemy ships.When you go to a space station, on the upper left you can select hiring troops or mercenaries. Hire as many troops as you can, and then go find an enemy ship. Find an enemy ship that has as many or less personnel than the troops you hired.  The number of personnel is listed to the right of the 'lock on' information.Destroy most of the enemies hull, but leave about a quarter. Then from your 'center mouse button' menu select send troops. Over on the right side of your screen a small flag will appear showing your troops are boarding the ship and how many troops are left on both sides. At this point you can click on the green arrow to send extra troops, if you don't send extra troops you will probably lose the battle.  If and when you capture the ship, and you must learn how to capture ships, use the tractor lock on in the 'center mouse button' menu. Then head back to a space station and sell it. In the beginning ships get you about $100 K, maybe a little less. But that beats the $10 K per trip of breaking rocks. Then use that money to buy better lasers, missiles, and systems upgrades. You do not get experience points for capturing ships though.(unless it finishes a mission) Destroying ships gives you experience points. Once you have upgraded your ship as much as you can, then go start doing missions to gain experience points.Make sure you save at least one of every higher level ship to use as you rank up. If you are good enough at combat, you can capture ships larger and better than yours. Then once you rank up you can start using them instead.  I have succeeded capturing ships with one third less personnel on my ship than the enemy ship. I think the worst damage to the enemy ship the less troops you need.Definitely read the instructions in the upper right ? Icon.Pros:It definitely is a well-made galaxy. It's pretty, large, has lots of planets, anomalies, and wormholes. The wormholes can be a little crazy when you're in a battle and one grabs you and sweeps you away!It has lots of great ships to choose from.Plenty of different armaments to choose from.Some armaments work well in some situations and then do not work as well in others.Lots of side missions to choose from.The campaign story is really good.Cons: Even though it has a good campaign story, the voice acting is some of the worst I've ever heard in most of the characters.  It seems like they went around from high school to high school looking for the worst of the drama students they could find to perform the stories.The mission text portions have obviously been poorly translated. I think it was originally in German. A lot of the stories and side missions are just given to you in text form, and because of the poor translation it can be hard to understand what they are trying to say.Considering the size of the galaxy they provide, the main campaign was too short. I did tons of side missions, finished the story, and still had half the galaxy unexplored. Since I find no point in just roaming around the galaxy for no particular reason, the rest will remain unexplored.All in all:It was totally money well spent! I also got the two extra campaigns which I will now go and play.			"

												This is the space sim I've been looking for since I stopped playing Freelancer; big open world, customisable ships, factions, upgrades and a big open world. I get to fly around a large universe, exploring, trading, collecting bounties or mining and still feel like there's more out there to see/do. Maybe these things are available in EVE, but I wouldn't know as I don't get enough gaming time these days to justify a monthly subscription.This game is about captaining a ship; the piloting and gunning controls work best if you select a target/destnation and tell the ship to attack or move.Here's my first impressions after 20 hours:Pros Big open world (might have mentioned this already) Customisable ships Various factions to befriend / hunt down Freedom to choose between merc, trader, explorer, etc No game breaking bugs (so far)Cons Feels like a late beta - the DLC prompt EVERY SINGLE TIME I start the game, despite my saved games already using the DLC. There's also missing voice files for some conversations and custom key configurations aren't saved between sessions. Voice acting, when it's there (some of the voice files are missing) Tutorial - be prepared to click through screens of dull text every time you mouse over a control the first time you play and still have to look things up afterwards. Do yourself a favour and watch some YouTube guides instead.Still I reckon this'll be one of my most played games by the time I finish with it.			"

												Basically Freelancer.Similar to Sid Meier's Pirates but in space. Huge space.Ship customization similar to Mechwarrior's mech customization.Mine asteroids, hunt bounties, play with the market, buy better ships, better equipment, etc.Streamlined user interface.Combat is good. There's several weapon types for you to try out. Rockets, laser beams and plasma cannons to name a few, each with their own properties and upgrades. Get on your gunship and chase enemies by their tail or line up your battleship and bombard them mercilessly. Your choice.Exploration is good. The game gives the player a huge world to explore. Planets, space stations and shipyards that offer different products depending on their region. Planets and space stations act as hubs, you can't set foot on them and explore. Not as huge as Elite Dangerous but huge nonetheless. Music is good. Too bad there's not much to go around. If you have a space exploration playlist then add this game's music to that playlist and play that instead.Economy is there. Trade clean goods or contraband. You can take advantage of rising and falling prices of materials but the economy isn't deep enough to make it an engaging enterprise. You can mine asteroids or scavenge space junk while going about your trade route, I guess.CAN'T FORM A FLEET. You can capture enemy ships. You either sell them, keep them or scrap them. Keeping them puts them in your garage. You can switch between ships YOU CAN ONLY USE ONE SHIP AT ANY TIME. The closest to a fleet you'll get is by hiring mercenaries to fly with you for a price. Even then you can't command them. This is probably the worst negative point of the game in my opinion.Light RPG elements.A good space game overall but if you're into trading, playing with the economy or empire building then this game won't satisfy you. I bought this on sale at 80% off so it's more than worth the money.			"

								Yes and no !Yes for its not buggy at all for being a Early access, its fully runable as you can shoot asteroids and collect ore, you can travel and of course fight ships !No because it still need some things like First Person view, nicer ships ( compared to X3 ) nicer stations and such !It is an Early Access game, Devs are frequently visitors in forums and they really suck in all intel they get from people there, so it might be a good game this - My suggestion is to wait till the game is finished, but after all its only 21:49 Euro, so its really up tp you !Enjoy :-)			"

												As many reviews state, this game starts out amazingly. Once you figure out the 3 things to do though, you are done. There is no taking over rival factions or expanding faction space. In fact, the factions may as well not exist other than to proivde you with dynamic enemies.The appearance and interface in this game is great. I just want more guts. The core is so flacid I simply stopped playing due to boredom. Stories and missions are mostly a joke. Go assassinate this guy. Go do this. Go do that. Fly for hours between. It just ends up being grind for the sake of grind.Get it on sale. Play for a bit. I got 8 hours out of it and will probably spin it up again in the future for another hour or two. "

												havinghad this game from the alhpa release it has been constantly improved with each patch that has been applied and if there are any problems then you can alqays email andlet them know, oneof the thing i love about this game.  having palyed other games like the x series this one doesnt seem to have as steep lerning curves as the x series does for example, only thing is i wish you culd explore planets and stations when landing, but maybe that will comeout in one of the future pathches, asl well as the key to cut the talk between characters doesnt seem to quiet workm but again will probably be addressed in a future patch. i love this game for me it has a trek feel to it, and i have spent many hoiurs happily wasting my life on it, and will continue to do so			"

												I gave this 15 hours as at first it seems like lots of upgrades and stuff that make it seem technical which I like.But this game has no substance and no depth.I'm so bored I am watching a movie at the same time and still bored with it.I could go into detail but whats the point when no one will ever read this.Think of this as a boring point and click mobile phone game that requires grinding the same hand full of missions over and over to level up and get new ships.  But then you realise its all the same.And you will come to a point where you need to fly to a space station to save every single time you pass anyting as instant death is just around the corner.  Do this boring save crap or replay the last 30min before you died.Yawn.....			"

												I remember getting this game when it was still in its alpha/beta form with only a few things to do besides blowing up ships, blowing up asteroids, taking their goods, and then selling them at a market for a few dollars (which seemed weird back then because ships cost a ♥♥♥♥ TON and still do, but there are ways to get more money now.) So playing now, seeing that it is full release form, welllllll....it's still empty. I mean, there is absolutely almost nothing going on except for an occasional enemy ship flying in to a friendly territory that gets obliterated in a second. Other than that, nope, nothing. People that hate you, hate you and people that like you, like you, not much else. I thought it'd be awesome to be the revered space pirate captain who steals from all and gets in the way of people to scavenge as much money as possible, even between factions. Which is another huge problem, factions do not feel like they have bad ties between each other, it's as if they are both completely isolated with their borders set in place without anything in between. And there aren't even any huge battles as well, the closest one I got was between myself and 30 other enemy ships. So you might ask, ""What is there to do?"" Well, exactly what I explained at the beginning, you do missions, kill enemies, blow up debris and turn it into a station for some money, like, a little amount of money. And the most money you get is from ship debris -floating ship debris and destroyed ships- which on maximum with the stock ship which can only hold 45 units is about $30,000 maximum give or take. So how much does an upgraded ship minus weapons cost? Depending on your preference from the different types, a direct upgrade would be from 2-5 mil even though it can go higher to prices of 30 million. So with mining and missions ranging in price from 10-20 thousand, you're looking at doing this 66 times to afford a new ship and that's at the maximum you'll get from mining and missions just for a 2 mil ship. Yes, there are hero ships that give you about 5 mil if you destroy them, but so far I've found no real way to track them other than hearing the news saying they are in so-and-so region, and even if you do find them, they are at impossible difficulty and usually have other ships around them so good luck. Did I have fun though? Yes, I had fun in some parts when I tried to dodge enemy ships while firing, but after your first few things to do it gets incredibly boring.			"

												This game is awesome. If you ever played the amaizing FTP Mobil game ""Galaxy on Fire 2"" and wanted more, this game delivers on all fronts.  It is almost a disservice to compare this game to it but it has everything that I love and more. Tons of ships to buy, loads of equipment to compare and upgrade, factions to ally or make enemies with, complex trading system, large variety of side missions, and an engaging story. The combat is engaging, I love capturing ships and selling them, the mining the dozens of different types of asteroids is eye candy, and there are tons of secerets to find and explore. I love this game and would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world space games.  "

There just aren't enough good space trade/fight/explore games any more so this is a welcome relief from the market that's been saturated with FPS games.  LGM are a credit to the PC gaming world and really do support their followers and they deserve our support back.Highly recommended and I cannot wait to get more game time in but I unfortunately have a job :-<			"

												Overall great space game (7.5/10)Things that annoyed me with this was not being able to skip the dialogue, I'd honestly rather read that, even if you do disable the sound it seems in parts you don't have enough time to read whats there. One last thing is it does get annoying travelling from point a to b but then again it's space, space is huge !That aside, I do enjoy the game, plus they're always updating.( I take the dialogue thing back, the game is easy to hack, remove dialogue timer and add a continue button, done =) )			"

												There are ultra realistic space sims,  there are slow paced datasheet space sims,  and on and on and on you can go down the laundry list of space games.   What Starpoint Gemini 2 seeks to accomplish is finding a healthy balance of it's predecessors without leaning too far in any particular direction.   Make no mistake,  SG2 will take you hours to accomplish anything substantial,  but it won't take you hours to start doing something fun.  Want to be a trader?  You can do that.   Want to mine for rare materials?  You can do that.  Want to be a pirate?  You'll eventually be able to do that.  Want to be the force of good bringing bad guys to justice while getting paid for your bounty kills?  You can do that to.    My 7 hours have been mostly spent divided between the three classes that you can choose from in the freeform game.  There is the Leader,  Gunner and Engineer.   Each class provides a fairly substantial difference on terms of feel however the common objective between most of these skills is all the same...   kill your enemy.   I was a bit disappointed to see that many of these skills are not overly helpful for more mundane tasks like mining,  trading,  or exploration.  Seeing as how the game puts heavy emphasis on providing you options - this particular part said to me ""We're only truly designing this game with combat in mind"".   While the other things to do are definitely not afterthoughts,  they're not quite as fleshed out and as robust as I would have liked.There is a story mode but unfortunately the voice acting is horrible.  Normally I can manage some bad voice acting but found this to be a bit too much.  This turned out to be alright in the end as the sandbox aspects of this game are fun and easy to get into.  The tutorial or lack there of was at least filled with a pop-up tips menu which got me rolling quickly enough.  I had to spend some time rummaging through the keybind menu but after that I was off and racing.  This game still feels very young with a lot of possiblities.  My 7 hours is definitely not enough time to even have a completely firm grasp of what the late game or even middle game will be like but I have a hunch it's going to just be more of the same but with higher stakes involved.  Instead of combat with 3-6 ships,  it'll be more along the lines of 10-20 ships if the trailers and other various videos are telling a truthful tale.   Scaling of this nature is not altogether a bad thing if you're having fun with everything you're doing at the start of the game.  Essentially,  it's not going to mix up the formula a whole lot as you get deeper into the game.  Sure you'll be able to use more skills due to having higher energy and more points to place down extra turrets and systems...  but most of those tools could be used at the start of the game as well,  just within limitations.   If I could pick one thing I wish this game had, it would be co-op support.  Sharing a universe with 2-16 friends could serve for some amazing lan or house hold family fun.  Luckily the mod community seems to be getting behind this game so at the very least the variety of things to do will be getting mixed up a lot.  If you're still on the fence of this game I'd say just keep checking back.  Look at what the devs and the mod community are up to.  There is already a decent amount to do here and it's just done well.   If I had to give it a 1-10 rating I'd say we have ourselves an 8.2 with the clear opportunity to become a 9-9.5 if they continue to add features.   If you're someone who enjoys smelling the flowers and doing assorted tasks with some grinding mechancis involved due to large credit costs to purchase anything substantial,  then this game is the game for you!Give me a thumbs up if you found this review useful.

												One of the first Space-sim type of games I have found fun in quite a while. The controls/UI wont scare you away and are very functional, and the game feels pretty polished for a new release. While combat only missions are getting slightly repetitive I find the combat itself is very fun if you use manual aim and avoid just getting into a rythym of auto-fire on locked targets. It adds more challenge to the combat and keeps it fresh every encounter trying to dodge incoming fire while positioning yourself correctly to fire your batteries and having to stay on your toes while aiming. I have been seeing a lot of threads calling combat ""lackluster"" or boring, but every one of them have been people using auto-aim and most likely just flying circles around the enemy ships haha. Of course that would become boring quickly, and the manual aiming is what makes me like this game more than a lot of other space sims that do not even have that option.On top of the combat there is trading(though not really worth it right now, but patches will surely improve it), mining, and boarding enemy ships to capture and haul back for good cash or to use it yourself. Mercenaries have been fixed in the latest patch as well which I have yet to try so cannot comment on that(allies that fly with you and help in combat which you can control to an extent). The campaign is pretty basic, but it has a decent story going on and gives you something else to do on the side when you get bored of freelance missions, mining, or trading to get into better ships and better upgrades for each ship. All in all I am enjoying the game and can't wait to see what else is added down the line(devs have already confirmed they want to add more endgame with station ownership and faction warfare). And to top it all off you can already mod the game and there a few complete revamps already even though the game has just released. Highly recommended if you liked any older space-sims like Freelancer or the like.			"

												Very similar to Freelancer but with focus on capital ships instead of fighters. Graphics, audio and atmosphere excellent. The UI has a great ""future-tech"" feel especially when Tactical Overlay is used. Levelling speed, money-making, difficulty and weapon balancing is still a work in progress afaik but it's still a great game as it is now. Ship designs are hit-and-miss, some ships look incredible while others look kinda horrid, but that's a subjective thing.Highly recommended if you like Freelancer.			"

												A  Very solid buyI would recommend old school fans of Escape Velocity, Freespace and the X series.In its current state the game currently falls well short of being a master works, it lacks a level of immersion, complexity and feels like needs fair bit more spit and polish to be called finished. That being said it’s the best addition the genre in years. i may be speaking too soon as the developers seem to have fair bit of steam left for adding and fixing things up too.The game plays like a more arcade version of the X series it reminds me a lot of X rebirth without all the complete fail. It’s simple and fast paced space action that falls between somewhere between dog fighting and EVE online ship management and thankfully nothing like the orginal starpoint gemini.ProsBest, fight, trade and explore game in years.Solid graphicsDecent universe to exploreReasonably fast and action packedOngoing development ConsSeems 90% FinishedNo empire building Shipload equipment and loadout overly simple.Campaign worth avoiding – just don’t			"

												First review of a game... I am an older gamer and I am very picky about the games I get obsessive about. This Game is not finished, but the available content is more than enough to keep you busy. This is not a straight up shooter... this has more of a quest rpg style where you can be what you wanna be. The game reminds me of a game I used to play way way back in the day called starflight. You can customize your ship with colors and logos and plenty of weapons to choose from. Very Eve-escent with the loadouts. Nowhere near as complex as EVE though... and nowhere near as boring of a start like EVE... you can start shootin from the onset - and if you do a little research before you begin, you can hijack ships right from the start... Remember boys and girls, strip the captured ship before you sell it! The content that is coming is intriguing in the possibilities... I have been playing it hardcore now and I am still not bored. I paid full price for it and I am not disappointed!!!			"

												I can't believe how awesome this game is. I just roam around and upgrade my (Weapons, shields, etc). Doing random mission trying to save up enough money to buy a new ship. There are so many ships with different stats, so its nice to find a ship that fits to your game-play. Like one that has great guns and shield for dogfights. Or huge freighters used for trading and mining. Also as you do more missions you began to improve your rank, What that basically means is you can control bigger and badder ships. Eventually you will feel the awesome power of Dreadnoughts or Carriers. These ships have more slots for weapons and diffrent weapons, just to customize it the way you like it. Also be careful there are high level ships out there. Some with bounties of 5mill, it's a gamble but if you can defeat them, you get paid bank! I personally love seeing an amazing ship and attacking it, bring it down to it knees. Weakening their defense and killing some of their troops in the process but before I kill them I latch the tractor beam and order my troops to board. If you have more troops (stats) then them you can capture their ship and tow it to the next star base to put in your garage or to sell for good $. I been having a blast.			"

You can do whatever you want... freelance for bounty/rewards, mine, salvage, be a pirate, be a merchant trader... whatever.  It looks great to the eye, very nice visual appeal.  I have found that the game experiences a crash now and again, but not until I've played it for a couple of hours straight.  I save very often so it doesn't hurt to badly when it happens.

No more flying around space in measly fighter.Perfect? No. But certainly worth the look you any interest in space exploration type games.			"

												Well what can i say i absolutely love this game. Every time i play this game it take's me back to when i used to play colony wars on PS1. This game is definitely made for people who dont have the time sit and grind the hell out of a game to get anywhere. For example im only 30 hrs in this game and im already running around the galaxy in a dreadnought feeling like a absolute power house. You rank up very quickly and theres easy money to make out their. Other then that the ships look awesome and the galaxy it self looks stunning.the only thing i found wrong with this game is that it doesnt feel like a simulation it has more of a arcade feel to it but if your some one like me who doesnt have alot of time on your hands because of works and is raising kids then who give's a s@#$			"

If you like space games with trading, mining, some RPG elements, and some more tactical style combat instead of dogfighting than this is the game for you.			"

												It brings back that good feeling of having the galaxy at your fingertips, like in Freelancer and Elite, without the insane complexity of X3 etc. I still feel like I'm just starting out and I've put in some hours allready. It is not the new & perfect game. Some mechanics need some tweaking or better explanation (Turrets, all power to engines, etc.) but you can generally customize your ship to do exactly what you want it to. In particular the open world / sandbox play works nicely.In general I'd recommend the game, but be mindful of what the game is and isn't. It is not the hugely ambitious world of X, but then again, it is much easier to pick up and play; it is relatively approachable, but complex enough that you'll spend the first half hour at least going 'Now what? How do I do this?'. It is worth muddling through, though, if you're interested in this type of game.			"

								About 4 hours in.  I'm liking it enough to spend 4 hours, that says something.   Still playing around, still exploring, and still enjoying.   Very reminisent of Starfleet Command.   For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.   I'm installing and trying it (prequel) now, though I've heard most of the issues were address post release, making for a very enjoyable game.			"

												The latest update has elevated this to the most satisfying trading simulation I have ever had the pleasure of playing. Not only can you see what various commodities are trading for at the stations you have visited, you also see the distance you currently are from each of those stations. This adds another level of decision making – is the extra distance you might have to travel for a ‘best’ price worth the time it will take to get there, or is a slightly lower price actually the better deal? A small thing, perhaps, but it does make you approach your cargo manifest a bit more critically when deciding on what and when to trade.The second thing this encourages is exploration. You only see the prices for the stations and planets you have discovered. I find myself compelled to push into unknown territory on that never ending quest for the ultimate trade route. And the commodity information screen itself is wonderfully easy to use. The filters are a tremendous help, eliminating the need to scroll through every item available. Are you a miner? Click on ores. Love to hunt down pirates? Quickly discover who is offering the best price for those contraband items.As you may have guessed, I’m a merchant at heart, not a fighter. But I’ve found the battles to be well-balanced and a simple click will tell you if that tantalizing enemy ship you have your eye on has the capability to turn you into so much space dust. Not that the knowledge will necessarily stop you, but at least you’ll know what you’re up against. And for those times when you do take on just a bit more than you can chew and yet somehow manage to pull it off by the skin of your shields, well – you know the feeling.The graphics are gorgeous, the gameplay is addicting, and personalizing your ship is as much fun as creating a new character in most RPGs. At this point the only thing I’m hoping for is that we may eventually see a larger collection of avatar portraits. The new group was a nice addition, but as a female gamer I find the two current offerings lack some of the personality that the male portraits possess. And that something so minor is the only flaw I can find says a lot about how truly innovative and honestly fun this game is. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a trade empire to build. "

												Didnt think too much of this when it was mentioned to me.  I was burned on X-Rebirth, played eve online, and mostly disappointed by anything space-wise that has not been eve.  X:3 was a decent game as well.  I picked this up for ~$20 and was instantly impressed with the game.  It has a huge map, really great fights, and things arent handed to you.  It does feel like it needs some touchup with certain aspects, but they are VERY minor and the devs are constantly looking for opinions on how to improve it.  Its an excellent game in its current form and with the addition of Workshop, its going to be huge when the mods start rolling out.  I highly recommend this game.			"

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

I next beamed over my superior marine forces and collected the bounty on his head. With his ship a drift, I tractored it to the closest friendly base where I added his battleship to my garage. Now I fly around fighting these pirates in his old ship. Big thumps up for this beta game.			"

								Amazing game. As close to Freelancer 2 as I think we've gotten or will get with next gen sims like Elite and Star Citizen coming out. There's a huge amount of depth here and free play mode is seriously awesome. So far I have...Missions / Trade / Exploration ( the universe is pretty huge and there are no jumpgates, you want to go somewhere be prepared to have a tea and fly it )Boarded and pirate who attacked me while mining. Stole their ship, towed it back to station, 60k profit w/ a hold full of ore as well. Enough to purchase some weapon and power grid upgrades & repair my own hull.Still mining, happily shooting rocks in a deep and immersive asteroid belt miles from any station ( the graphics are fantastic ) again unaffiliated scumbag smuggler drops my shield and attempts to hack my power grid. Fire a grappler, boost shields, send feedback up his signal to shut down his shields instead, steal everything on board, destroy his engines and leave him to die in the darkness.Ships are hugely expensive. Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )Right now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight. If anyone needs me I'll be in my cabin.All is quiet... for now.And this is alpha. Srsly.			"

It has a bit of everything that is loved by space game fans, and although not too complex fills the part nicely.It is 3rd person only, with the option of a turret view which allows rotation of your view around your ship.  This design has a really nice feel to it allowing for some good tactical combat.I would warn you that it is different than most, in the way things are controlled or handled, so a hour or two of getting to grips with these is needed, but then rewarded.The dev's are very active on the forums and do pick up on fans good ideas for the game, which is a bonus.I would say that it IS worth the risk of purchase, even in this early state is is fun to play.

								I haven't played this game much to start, but I can say that for the time I have spent playing it that it is the space sim game I have been looking for. I've tried a few other space sim and space sim-like games such as ""Galaxy on Fire 2"", ""SpaceForce: Rogue Universe"", and (sadly to say) ""X-Rebirth"" and in my opinion and experience I have found them to be full of frustration and disappointment for me.But Starpoint Gemini 2 feels very intuitive. I'm not lost trying to figure out the controls because the tutorial at the beginning clearly and plainly explains them. I've had few issues with bugs or glitches. Iv'e only had to make screen resolution/graphics adjustments in the game settings to prevent slight lag, which I'm sure that it will either be sorted out soon or my pc just needs an upgrade. I am also thankful for the leveling out command so that when I am upside down or slighlty off level I can let the game level me out without me screaming/freaking out. (Which in space, no one can hear you scream... lol!)Also, if you're looking for a good space sim game don't waste your time on other ones like X-Rebirth (especially not X-Rebirth!) because S♥♥♥♥lso has a reliable dev team. So it's not just because of the graphics, controls, etc. that makes the game great, but also because there is support. I've noticed that the devs for this game actually care about user input/feedback and work on the game updates in a timely manner which makes me want to play more and get invovled in the developing.This one is truly promising and fun to play as it is now. I am eager to see this game finished but not rushed and with lots of new options, features, and plenty of storyline/campaigns to play through.			"

								Love this! Have not stopped playing it since I downloaded it. Shows a huge amount of promise in terms of gameplay; the visuals of the spaceflight scenery, ships, asteroid belts, stations and nebulae are brilliant and very atmospheric. Even the icons and equipment images are polished and impressive.There are the inevitable comparisons to games like Elite and X, but even in this early incarnation I feel that Starpoint Gemini has the capacity to surpass them; I haven't seen much of the trade mechanic yet, but have enjoyed myself immensely with the freelance missions and grappling enemy ships before boarding, capturing and selling them.Some other memorable moments so far are the sound of the engines powering up when you leave a station, or slicing up asteroids to mine ores.I also really like the dimensions in the game - the stations are big, but the planets are massive and I like that you can land on them. I'm about 20 hours in and have covered maybe a quarter of the map (and most of that was a fleeting visit).The gameplay gets sticky on my machine moving between sectors but  this is only the Alpha build and I imagine there is still a lot of coding spit-and-polish to come.My wishlist for the finished game would be to be able to reduce the number of turrets as well as increase them (have been a bit overly-optimistic with power management for my Myrmydon weaponry) and for alliance ships to stop shooting at my captured enemy vessels while I'm trying to drag them back to port.Highly recommended if you like space exploration/combat/trade games.

								A really interesting looking game. I like the controls, highly customisable, flying star-fighter style seems equally as easy turret-based capital ship combat( depends only on the style of ship, which can be better suited to either, which is exactly what it should be). HUD and contextual control panel pack a LOT of options and info into a simple, streamlined system. Graphically it's easy on the eye, won't praise it, but there's nothing I can think of that would need pointing out.The thing that would need tweaking is a detail, but impacts the game heavily, since it does with navigation: The waypoints do not say WHAT they point to on the map. Can't tell whether it's my active mission, accepted but not active or a completely new one. To be fixed ASAP, as going from point to point IS the game.The only other minor thing doesn't impact gameplay, but would make it a bit more interesting:*Refine the weapon mounting system. Grouping them together for ship sides is a good idea, but it would be good to have access to all single individual mounts anyway, also showing where they are on the ship, Star Wolves style (since they avoid fireing THROUGH the ship, which is as unexpected as it is brilliant), for enabling a more tactical loadout.*Connecting to the former, make the whole drydock/store/exchange window bigger and clearer. As it is now is not very intuitive and requires spending at least a few minutes just studying it to finally grasp what half the options actually are, much less taking advantage of them.In general, a good game even at this stage, just needs tweak and a good plot implemented. The latter would make a good game a great game.			"

This games UI and setup is so easy/simple that even someone who has never played any space sims before can get the hang of within an hour or so, and that's FAST.  The UI may be simple, but it's still got the same flexibility to let you do what you want.  Every time I start a new space sim, I always think 'oh god, i gotta relearn the whole system again.'  but not for this one.  Also, that map UI reminds me soo much of google chrome.  Currently, the gameplay is extremely fun even for not being complete.  One could hardly tell, except for the fact that skill, equipment, and fighter keybinds don't work--but that's okay, they're all just a mouseclick away via the easy to use UI.  I haven't played long enough though to figure out how deep this game is, whether or not the trading system is static or dynamic, or whether or not what you do affects prices.  I haven't played long enough to see whether or not the universe is 'alive' like in other games, but this is good enough for someone who wants to pick up their first space sim and not be overwhelmed.

								This game is fantastic, especially for an Alpha release.  Several things are still in the works, but it is a fine game as is.  Right now it is essentially a space sandbox.  I tend to play the role of pirate, or privateer, rather (I only attack the bad guys, but I'm always trying to board them and steal their ships so I can tow them back to a planet or space station and sell off their guns, then the ships themselves... seems to be pretty lucrative).  You'll love it when you get a big carrier with a bunch of fighter wings or bombers... it's awesome having a swarm of firepower surrounding you.  The game is massive and consists largely of traveling between planets and space stations (press B to boost your engines to full and enjoy the ride and the amazing scenery), doing sidequests, mining asteroids, or being a merchant or pirate or whatever suits your fancy.  There is currently no storyline or any story missions (but plenty of sidequests are available and constantly appearing), and a lot of things are currently non-functional (like the useable items... thankfully they are super valuable so I just sell them for lots of money), but with that being said, this game is amazing... I'm really looking forward to years of fun with this thing.			"

								I love it I love it I love it.I've been playing this for some good hours straight. I have encoutered minimal bugs like when I'm on the starmap, my cursor has to be a little bit off of what I'm actually trying to click on... sure it's annoying but this is only in alpha, and that is my main concern?? Very well done game I'm extremely excited to see this game evolve! Although I am glad I got it on sale, 15$ maybe 20$ would be a better price than what it is. I'm getting tired of seeing alphas and early access games near full price. It's an alpha for a reason. Aside from the high price this game is definitely on my recommendations list.Cheers!			"

								Tracked one of the most notorious pirates through out several star systems. Cloaked my ship, and carefully positioned myself right behind his engines. Then all at once I unleashed a volley of plasma, beams, and fusion torpedos. After crippling his ship, and his crew members, I launched a viral torpedo to further reduce his fighting force. I next beamed over my superior marine forces and collected the bounty on his head. With his ship a drift, I tractored it to the closest friendly base where I added his battleship to my garage. Now I fly around fighting these pirates in his old ship. Big thumps up for this beta game.			"

								while a fun game there are a few big flaws for one the default freeroam scenario which has no story line puts you in the shoes of some random dude after this big build up starting speech and you have no clue who the hell this is or what he is there for even a open sandbox needs to at least tell you who the bloody hell you are playing as or let you create you own character aside from that mild annoyance the game is pretty solid and hopefully the modding community grows to help put this game over the top			"

								pretty good for an alpha release. has some real potential. hoping it gets fleshed out more as the they progress. all that they need to add is the ability to have fleets and AI ships following you and witht he ability to command them to do things. solid 7/10 at the moment would be a 8 or a 9 if their was more features and a better tutorial. which im sure will be fixed. beats the sorry excuse of a game called x-rebirth which i payed £40 for and is in far worse condition that this alpha game.

								Amazing game. As close to Freelancer 2 as I think we've gotten or will get with next gen sims like Elite and Star Citizen coming out. There's a huge amount of depth here and free play mode is seriously awesome. So far I have...Missions / Trade / Exploration ( the universe is pretty huge and there are no jumpgates, you want to go somewhere be prepared to have a tea and fly it )Boarded and pirate who attacked me while mining. Stole their ship, towed it back to station, 60k profit w/ a hold full of ore as well. Enough to purchase some weapon and power grid upgrades & repair my own hull.Still mining, happily shooting rocks in a deep and immersive asteroid belt miles from any station ( the graphics are fantastic ) again unaffiliated scumbag smuggler drops my shield and attempts to hack my power grid. Fire a grappler, boost shields, send feedback up his signal to shut down his shields instead, steal everything on board, destroy his engines and leave him to die in the darkness.Ships are hugely expensive. Hatched a plan... equip a gunship w/ a cloak and heavy shielding. Observe trade routes and traffic to a wormhole. Wait for lost lamb transport indy with no escorts ( they are tough as nails and heavily armored ) ... decloak, target, fire a grappler, boost shields and tear their ship apart until they surrender, kill everyone on board, towed it to station under a salvage license since it was an independent, now it's mine. All repaired and with a new coat of paint & trade license ( my main job, trading is awesome and dynamic, you need smarts and a good memory of hundreds of stations / planets )Right now I'm flying across the universe in a heavily armored trade / transport ship carrying passengers, 2 vips and sipping a tea on autopilot. 100 thousand K to go, it's going to be a long flight. If anyone needs me I'll be in my cabin.All is quiet... for now.And this is alpha. Srsly.			"

								Starpoint Gemini 2 a sequel with lots of improvements, while keeping to the free form of the predecessor.This game feels as motivating as Freelancer with its extensive Universe to explore, dozens of ships, different ship classes and moddable loadouts.I did enjoy this game very much, it plays like a cross-over between freelancer (free to explore universe, dozens o ships) and the Star Trek Fleet Command titles (tactical fights, commanding capships).Whether you want to relax mining and trading, or engage in combat missions and piracy, this game will be worth its money.Did i mention you can capture enemy ships by boarding combat? You can!If it flies, it is there for the taking!As a captain your first and foremost crucial choice will be your class.You can either be a Commander, featuring buffs for your fleet, empowered strike craft, retaliatory attacks and defensive boosts.Or you can try to outgun the enemy by becoming a Gunner, who can specialize his offensive power by adding effects like disabling hits to his beam weapons, firing more shells with railguns, adding a higher refire rate to his high damaging plasma canons or boosting his heavy weaponry (schockwave cannons, missiles and torpedos).Last but not least the Engineer, a very versatile class with a lot of debuffs.Ever got tired of fast moving corvettes and gunboats dodging your railgun shots?Just place a Rift-Anomaly and slow them down, then hit 'em hard!Your second decision might be to specialize in a ship-category, as you can boost the efficiency of your ship by spending perk-points granted every 5 levels.What will be your choice? A fast and mobile light ship(gunboat/corvette)A merchantship, to rule the market with your cunning? (transport/freighter/freight-liner)A medium class mobile Warship? (Frigate/Destroyer/Cruiser)A vessel of personified dread? (Battleship/Dreadnought/Carrier)The Choice is yours to make, though it is not final,for you can reset your spent skill- and perk-points while being docked to a station or planet and try anew.Currently this game is in Beta Version 0.7, so there are still some issues and lacks:- ingame descriptions of skills and mechanics lack some love and proper english translation - the weapons need some diversity, e.g. faster firing weapons need a higher projectile speed to use them against fast moving targets (railguns and plasma weapons)- boarding combat is currently a numbers game, lacking the predecessors ingame videos and feedback- the missions currently are restricted to Assassination (search and destroy), delivery, repair of beacons and rescue missions- they need to put in some ships from the predecessors (prokhorov for example) to add even more diversity to the allready well modeled and animated ships- ship special abilities are not included yet (like a full frontal arc auto-canon for baeldor frigates or high-energy blasts for dreadnoughts)			"

												Didnt think too much of this when it was mentioned to me.  I was burned on X-Rebirth, played eve online, and mostly disappointed by anything space-wise that has not been eve.  X:3 was a decent game as well.  I picked this up for ~$20 and was instantly impressed with the game.  It has a huge map, really great fights, and things arent handed to you.  It does feel like it needs some touchup with certain aspects, but they are VERY minor and the devs are constantly looking for opinions on how to improve it.  Its an excellent game in its current form and with the addition of Workshop, its going to be huge when the mods start rolling out.  I highly recommend this game.			"

								This is a ""first (actually second) impression""It's shaping up.I bought this game a while back, in my seemingly neverending search for a satisfactory Space game.There is a text-only tutorial that I never bothered with, so I can't comment on that. You can skip ahead without worries since you can reread it later on if you need to. Graphics are pretty decent, the ship designs I've seen so far are varied and cool for the most part.The biggest plus part so far, is that this game seems to focus more on capital ship warfare, rather than on fighters and small corvettes like many of its rivals.The interface is also good, albeit a bit unintuitive and at some times utterly unresponsive. Some keybinds don't seem to work and it still needs some visual or audio queues as to what you just did, there is no indication anywhere on your screen whether your weapons are set to free fire or not (at least none I can spot). It seems sandboxy enough so far, with content appearantly procedurally generated and catered to your ship and level.It's a diamond in the rough and clearly unfinished, but already playable enough for me, I will surely be spending some more time in this game than before.So if you have the money and can live with the flaws listed above, give this game a try.

												After 28 hours, I've finished SG2 on normal difficulty. I've mixed feelings about this game. Since I got it at a reduced price and it managed to enthral me long enough to finish it, I hesitantly recommend this game.  I'll give you a list of things that, in my opinion, are well done (from + to +++) or bad (from - to ---).Stability: +++ I've encountered not a single crash. Good work.Bugs: +There are some minor bugs but no show stopper. Most of the bugs are only slightly annoying or are gone once you restart.Graphics: ++Not cutting edge, but there are some nice visual effects that improve immersion. Audio: +Ok, but nothing eartshaking.Character development: -I didn't feel that there's anything that I really want to ""reach"" with my character, except maybe getting better ships. The skills are dull and consist mainly of ""tier 1 gives you +8% dmg"", ""tier 2 gives you 16% dmg"" and so on. HUD: --Bad HUD. You want to know what kind of ship you've just locked as a target? Well, better turn your giant Dreadnaught around and find out that it was just some tiny gunship that gets destroyed by your automatically firing canonns before you can take a look at it. You can't really scroll out while flying your ship, so that your view is basically reduced to what's in front of you.Aiming / Target selection in combat: ---They really dropped the ball here. You either enable automatic fire, which means that all your guns fire at will at a target of their chosing (no focus fire), or you take over manual control over your ship's weapons and try to hit your designated target. Unfortunately, this is so badly implemented that you will stick to auto fire 99% of the time.Missions: -You level up and get money from missions by activating the star map and click on a mission marker that has become available there. Missions are the entire content of the game. If you play the campaign, these mission markers may either be part of the main mission or they are a side mission. If you play in free mode (no campaign just pure exploration), there are no main mission markers. The side missions are repetitive as hell. Go there, kill that, finished. Go there, repair that, finished. Go there, take the item and bring it elsewhere, finished. Role playing / Character immersion: --Nope. No. There's none of that here, move along.Fights: +Fights are often balanced, sometimes not, but generally they are somewhat fun. Have a ""meh"" from me here. Traveling: --Pirates. Pirates, everywhere. Have you ever played an MMO where some frenzied rabbit may bite your horse and rip you out of travel mode so that you have to squish that little bug with one hit and then wait until you can enter travel mode again? Well, SG2 gives you some nostalgia here. Campaign: -The campaign is nothing special. You character is rather lethargic and just stumbles from one event into another. You can't make any choices either. The ending is rather unspectacular. I was like ""and now? that's all or what?"". There are no epic story fails, though. Replay value: --SG2's replay value is the same as the reeat value of a pizza.Customization options of your character and ship: +You can't customize your charakter except for his skills, but there are some nice options to personalize your ship, which is nice.Modifications: ++The fan base is strong in this one. There are some decent mods out there that give you new ship skins or that modify game values.If you can get SG2 for less than $15 and like the genre, go for it.			"

								Think StarTrek meets Cowboy Bebop. Yes, that good. At this stage in development only two things can be suitably inferred from this game. Its tone and core mechanics. And I am exceptionally pleased with both. Even as an early alpha it is successfully scratching a difficuly itch to reach.I wanted a game where I could zoom around the solar system getting into fights with phasers and torpedos, having to jockey for position all the while balancing my shields, engines, and weapons. SG2 gave me exactly that. The combat is very nice. In its current state the missions are randomly generated, MMO style, filler quests, but this does not prevent the encounters from being very fulfilling, if for no other reason then the solid underlying mechanics. This game will really cause you to think strategically. Will you perform the risky gambit of dumping all power to the shields and weapons to try and pick off a weakened enemy in one pass or will I shift that power into the engines and hope for a second chance to strike at that exposed hole in their shields. As the game progresses you will be making that decision and others as you have to contend with swarms of fighters and imposing warships. It requires just enough of the player to be extremely fulfilling when a risky maneuver works without being unduely frustrating when it fails. And you will fail alot. But the game is at its best when it is challenging. That is when the flexibile thinking and fast micromanagment that characterizes its combat will bring out your inner Jean-Luc Picard. And when it does you will feel great. The tone is harder to express then the mechanics, but is a perfect compliment to them. If you have ever watched Cowboy Bebop then this game will be like putting on a pair of comfortable shoes. Two things drive this feeling. First, the music distinctly reminds me of some of the tracks from the show. There are no jazzy interludes, but the background music reminds me of some prog songs accompanying the space scenes. The music is seamlessly woven into the background noise of your lasers, phasers, engines, and missles. Most of the time it is barely noticeable above the ruckus but it is a soothing distraction during a long sprint across the map. It simply suits the game, perfectly conveying the mystery and the solitude of space. The more obvious callout to the tone of Bebop is the types of missions available so far. Most are bounty type missions and trading runs. All taking place in fantasitic locals with cool space stations. The game has a very awesome setting. And the scale of which really makes you feel like a plucky captain trying to scrape by in a much larger universe. All in all I was looking for a game that would let me feel like I was flying a spaces ship. This did that and more! Not only did it have the gameplay I desired but it did so in a very cool way. As such SG2 has exceeded my expectations. It is perfectly filling a niche in my gaming library which I have been searching to fill. I would highly recomend the game to anyone who has got the space captain itch. Star Citizen is a far way away. But even in Alpha SG2 rocks! And its future looks so promising. All things considered, 9/10. The only downside is a slightly difficult camera. You will get used to it but I feel like it doesn't need to be something that we should have to get used to. An autolock feature which would keep the camera centered on a target and  making the turret mode more responsive with less 'momentum' would be sufficient. But this is just nitpicking. SG2 looks to be a great niche game. And if you are interested it deserves your money and attention. -rm			"

An autolock feature which would keep the camera centered on a target and  making the turret mode more responsive with less 'momentum' would be sufficient. But this is just nitpicking. SG2 looks to be a great niche game. And if you are interested it deserves your money and attention. -rm			"

								Possibly the most polished 'Alpha' build I have ever played.  The game is by no means complete at this moment in time, however its a lot of fun and is showing a great deal of promise.  If the developers are true to their word and remain as committed as they appear, then this could be something special...			"

												This is a fun, engaging ""light"" strategy / action game. It draws inspiration from both Starfleet Command and EVE online without being nearly as complex as either one. Think of it as StarEVE Offline Command - the Animated Series - and you will get the idea.If you are an experienced gamer in this particular genre you will probably pick up the basics in an hour or so, get a feel for the extent of the content in about 4 to 6 hours playtime - and feel sufficiently masterful after about 10-12 hours.To enjoy this game you have to patient, enjoy slower paced exploration coupled with quick bursts of fairly asymetrical combat (both in your favor and otherwise) - and be ready to allow for a certain quirkiness that comes from game devs whose native language is not English. On that point the devs are super nice peeps who love to get feedback and talk about how to improve the game on their forums.Like most games these days, SG2 is evolving. I think what we have now is a solid foundation for many expansions yet to come and I, for one, am looking forward to seeing where it goes from here.This is definitely a great game for people who, like me, enjoy playing for long stretches at night with groovy techno / trance music in the headphones while watching the beautiful space scenery slip by... without the constant combat of SFC or the massive timesink (and perpetual 2nd class citizen status) of EVE.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 maybe an early access game right now but the game feels a lot more complete than a number of new releases. The game is best described as a tactical space simulator in an open universe. The game in early access has no story mission i have found yet but a lot of small missions, exploration,mining and combat. The combat is a joy once you get used to the tactical use of gun turrets and weapon usage. The game has some really interesting ship to ship combat that is easy to get the hang of. Graphics at this stage are  excellant. Ship models are good and the effects are nice and are a lot more polished than what you would think for a game not completed yet. Sound and music are good with a nice musical track (although limited just now but will be increased when ame is finished)Would i recommend this game. Hell yes even at this stage and i look forward to seeing the end product.One other interesting note is the developers are always on the forums answering our questions and listining to our input and shows how dedicated they are to both the project and to their customers.

								As a long-standing fan of the sci-fi genre, I can say that this is the kind of game I've been looking for. It has everything that any space-fan would enjoy! Anomalies, planets, asteroids, nebulas, and tons more! You can trade, customize your starship, upgrade, and fight against pirates as well as enemy factions. The gameplay is unlike anything I've played before, in a good way, and makes it feel like it's ship-on-ship combat. Fighting in space is dynamic, involved, and intricate so it can be challenging at times but never too difficult. The variety of weapons you can add to your starship also helps to give the game a unique feel in combat. The game has the look and expanse of Eve while remaining a single-player only game. Finally, it is workshop/mod friendly! Personally, I like to cross-over different franchises into my games so it's really cool to see a Federation Starship flying around space and using weapons from Star Trek as a way to create a personalized and awesome experience. Definitely would recommend to any sci-fi fan. Better than a lot of AAA titles I've bought. Keep up the good work!			"

								UPDATE: After lots and lots of play time, I've lost very little enthusiam and this has become my favorite game.If you find yourself missing Freelancer but wishing it was more robust in just about every measure (barring an in-cockpit view), this game is for you. There is a vast universe, seamlessy connected* so that you can fly between them without having to load at a ""waygate"" like almost every other space game out there. Sure there are gates and wormholes and all the other staples, but they're not necessary. The starter ship is gorgeous, and you can customize the look of your ship in small ways. Combat uses a lot of showy glowy beams that seem to trade off well against each other balance wise, short-ranged instabeams, blaster/plasma-beam-ish projectiles, glowy-trails-having missiles and so on. Your turrets don't just magically fire through your ships, so firing arcs are a concern, and multiple turrets with mismatched areas of defense are possible. You can enlist specialists in your crew who cost you extra expense but provide bonuses, in addition to an amazing range of customizations. You can reassign power between guns-engines-shields on the fly.It's currently an open-world, with promises of guided story plots to come. At the moment you can mine and take run-of-the-mill and short missions, kill this scan that ferry those. You can buy hunting licenses for different groups froim their enemies. The game needs longer more immersive plots, but the dev has already stated there's more to come int hat regard.There's the controls. There is a wide range of things you can do in this game, giving somewhat detailed commands to your fleet and crew, cloaking, grappling (best to shoot the enemies' guns off first), instructing your crew which guns to shoot off first. It is... daunting... looking at your control customization options. I recommend playthrough with the control defaults at first until you find which controls you will actually use best in your personal play style. You will be using just about every key on your keyboard make no mistake.That takes me to the tutorials. Just suffer through them they are awful annoying popups but informative. *this is beta and there's a slight hiccup when moving from grid to grid			"

I wanna fly around a do ♥♥♥♥. I wouldn't say it's much of a sim, but it's enough micro management to make me feel in charge of my ship. I would call it a space adventure. I have much more to play of course, and I am excited. There's plenty to explore and learn. Also the game has a great team behind it that communicates with it's player and fans. If you liked freelancer, tie fighter/x-wing, open world RPGs, and games that involve the players, like steam workshop and such, then this game should give you all the feels you need.			"

For the price, I would say if you enjoyed any time with Starfleet, and being as fun as it is in early stage, it's well worth the $$ spent for the time I've already mined.I've not yet played the first iteration, but don't let it's low Metascore impact your opinion of the sequel.   I'm installing and trying it (prequel) now, though I've heard most of the issues were address post release, making for a very enjoyable game.			"

								Ok, first I want to say that overall, this is a fun game.  Even though it is in it's alpha phase, it still has a lot of fine points to keep me playing for the time being.  There is one point about this game that is going to kill it for me, but I'll get to that later.The graphics are well done.  I have several hours into it, and have yet to experience a graphical glitch.  The ship models are well done and the stations aren't bad to look at.The flight controls are a bit weird at first, but it really doesn't take much to get used to them.  The biggest gripe I have is that there is no first person view so you can't fly directly at something.  If you try, you actually fly over it.  Not that big of a deal and after you get used to it, it works out.  If you are flying mouse mode, there isn't enough dead space for level flight.  Your ship is always changing direction.  I ended up not utilizing the mouse mode and stuck with WASD.As it is still in Alpha phase there are only a few different types of missions to work on.  These are called Freelances.  They are usually quick and easy.  It looks like there will be several different types of missions put in later on, so this isn't a slight, just an observation.  Also, the money doesn't keep up with your pilot level.  I'm currently level 25 and still can't afford to buy another version of the same ship I'm currently in.  I should have been able to upgrade ships a while ago.  I'm sure with the advent of other missions, the money thing will probably work itself out.There needs to be more tutorials.  There needs to be something on Grappling and taking over ships.  Might be offered farther down the road.  Also on derelicts.  Try as I might, I can't figure them out.  I don't seem to get anything off of them.  I might not understand their mechanics, but since there is no tutorial on them, I don't know.Now for the part that breaks this game for me personally.  I do enjoy combat and exploration.  I've never been huge into trading or diplomacy.  However, I love games where I can create things.  Crafting is huge for me.  Starpoint Gemini 2 has these huge asteroid fields that if I spent years playing, I wouldn't be able to empty them out.  However, all you can do with them is shoot them for ore and then vendor it...for a very small price I might add.  There is nothing else to do with all of this ore.  Now, your saying...wait, it is still alpha, they might add it in later.  Well, I've read up in their forums and one of the developers has already stated that they don't plan on adding in any kind of crafting utility to the game.If I could put a station out in the fields, and have them manufacturing ship equipment, weapons & and ships themselves, this game would be one that I kept and played for years to come.  As it is, I'm going to get tired of shooting random encounters pretty quick.As a single player game, I need something that is going on in the background while I'm out exploring and building for the economy would be great.  Without this ability, the game gets stale, at least for me.For most people, this game will be great.  I know that a good majority of people don't care to craft anything.  For me, without it, it is a game breaker.			"

It's devs are very active, taking player considerations seriously. The mods are pretty dang fun, it's cheaper than most other games of its type, you can fill a variety of roles in game, ect.. The only real con I can see with the game so far is it's single player exclusive.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 + Secrets of Aethera DLC:Excellent sandbox space game, campaign missions are quite easy at first and then they aren't, you need a bigger ship. Which means credits.  Trading, pop-up missions, side missions, capturing ships and mining are your friends now.Once you get you fingers trained on flying it's a lot more fun...fly in hard and fast and then slow down to stay on the tail pipe of your target, watch out for the explosive radius of your own missiles.Trading/Mining could use some TLC. The small cargo space and low margins on items makes for a lot of trips for those playstyles to make a lot of credits. A dedicated mining ship would be a good idea, with maybe a compressor item or mining laser enhancement or something so that you can fit more than 1 ore in 1 cargo slot.The trading screens in the map could really use a mode to show best to/from, rather than a per-item best buy/sell, also remote buy/sell ala Eve would be great.But trading and mining isn't what this game is about. The real fun comes with capturing ships and running the various types of missions. Capturing takes a while to figure out, I suggest youtube and practise.  Basically, grapple, burn the hull down 2/3rds of the way, transport your troops and keep transporting them as long as you have troops. After you get the hang of it, you take every mission around your level just to try and capture another ship.The pop-up missions are rather generic, about 10 or so different types that I've found and they differ only in the difficulty of the enemies. Some are out-right free credits and XP (science, repair).The Side Missions are quite variable from the few I've done, more credits and XP and more difficult than the pop-ups.The Campaign Missions are similar to the Side Missions in reward and difficulty but advance the story-line.Exploring the map is a lot of fun, it's huge...also more areas to find capturable ships and missions. One downside, when you play windowed, if you focus off the game, it will pause. This is non-condusive to setting a long waypoint, maxing your engine power and doing something else on the other monitor. Very fast save/loads. The fights can be quite intense, the AI seems to be aggressive, but not stupid, it'll gang-tackle you quite happily. The auto-firing works great, but I'm not a fan of the way it keeps shifting targets to closest enemy as opposed to the target you've selected. I guess I have to learn manual firing.I suggest staying with the Tauris starter boat, pick a weapon type, level that type up  and stay with it for the first 20 levels or so. The gunboat is a paper-tiger, so you learn a lot about dodging, firing, and your equipment needs. Lot's of save and reloads figuring it out. ++Shield Boosters, Repair Nanobots, Hull Plates.66hrs, 8.5/10 and am still playing. It's not solo-Eve, but darn close.			"

												I love this game, I used to play EVE Online and other space sims like the X series, Elite dangerous etc this is a real gem. I have no idea why I did not buy it sooner even though not many campaigns are out (you only have the option of free roam or campaign with out mods I assume) the game has so much to do in it. I thought EVE had a ton of factions and corps but this game I swear theres at least like 40 factions and the idea of having a small fleet is amazing. Its a must buy for eve players.			"

												Campaign done, here's *thoughts*.Good:  To start off with, the music in SG2 is pretty great.  That's the first thing that hits me, and it's always good whenever I've booted the game.  A bit more variety would be nice too, after a while of free-roaming, it might get a little stale, but that goes for most games, really.Bad:  The dialog and cutscenes are terrible.  No, really REALLY terrible.  The dialog is cliche, and *hideously* over-acted.  And those accents?  AND NO SKIP??  And the game doesn't really pause during these tedious, cliche, dragging, unskippable cutscenes.  I've seen better cutscenes in pretty much any other game.Good:  Ships.  Mostly.  They're all quite recognizable, and have a lot of variety.  Once you know the ships, you can see a silhouette of most of them from most angles, and be able to ID the specific ship, or at least class.  Nexus ships a couple others in particular are EASY to spot.  Transports less so, but their class is obvious, so no matter.Bad:  Firing arcs.  These are SPACE ships, they should have minimal blind spots.  They are not floating in an ocean, they need coverage above and below.Bad:  There is a single ""best"" weapon, DPS-wise?  The stats show that, anyway.  Beams tickle, the only NPC weapons that seem to DO anything are rails and plasma.  This balance state made it out of early access?Bad:  Map and space design.  Freelancer got this right, and they had space with ""too much"" stuff in it.  The SG2 single solar system is both incredibly too small and insanely crowded.  It would be fine for say, underwater on an ocean planet, but for ""outer space"" it's just crowded.  And the ""movement"" field for dust floating past makes it feel like a fish tank with a broken filter and a bunch of pooping fish.Space Engineers and EVE and to a lesser extent Freelancer made the game FEEL spacious.  SG2 is a lot of LARGE factions crammed into a small fish tank with a bunch of stuff floating in the water.Bad:  I finally managed to get a ST-drive, yay!  ...Only to find that it doesn't actually work?  *All* the things should be working before the EA tag comes off.

								I am using the gunner class freeroaming the map which is pretty big , i like to bounty hunt those big marks for the credit pay outs.Combat has a very usefull auto fire or you can choose to manual fire, if you wish you can order fire on the systems of the target or just general hits.Favourite ship class is  the destroyer's but i'm currently using a carrier usefull for exploring when things get heavy launch the fighters.I honestly think this game has some real potential and have really enjoyed what they have done so far i look forward to them making the single player aspects.The market and trading and ultra silly cost of travelling the trade lanes needs a good sorting though but i'm sure they will iron out those minor things.Hint use T-Drives to jump to get to destinations.Found a pass that makes using the trade gates free to use anywhere very handy for trading i must have missed this on my first character it cost 250k credits but you will make it back eventually.Flight consists of mouse controll and keyboard activated specials allthough most of the special can be activated via the middle mouse  button, graphically it reminds me of freelancer space backgrounds. And it has some nice customization you can do to personlise your ship with unique colours and markings and abillity to name your ship.Overall i have to say i would recommend and seriously look forward to the up comming content  and i'm sure this game will give you plenty of hours of solid fun , just like freelancer did !Also there is an active mod community and the Devs seem active, these are promising signs for life beyond the single player mode and game life in the  long run.

Fans of major space games like the X series, EVE, and Freelancer will really find great potential in this game. If you love space games, rpg's and shooting stuff this game is worth looking into.I give this game a 10/10pros to me for this early access are easy to use controls, randomly generated side missions, gamepad support, amazing backgrounds and visuals, assortment of ships, skills and perks, and lastly a developement team that is truely dedicated to bringing an amazing game to its community.The only con would be that the map is not large enough to contain this much awesome.

								Edit: So here we are after full release.In all honesty, the story is not presented in a manner I really find easily accessable, which is too bad but survivable. Besides that, everything I was told would be in this game is here, and all the fun I saw coming back in EA is also here. This is early access done right.In case you haven't read any other reviews, the game is very similar to EVE or X3 in sandbox mode. In story mode it feels quite a bit more linear, but as I said, this is simply because the method of presentation is just not my style, and you may find it's exactly what you like.Still, lots of fun, lots of freedom, and lots of beautiful, beautiful space in which to make your own story. Good use of your money if you like spaceship combat/trader/adventure sims.Original reviews:Even in beta, this is a good game. Not only is the game very playable, but the graphics are good and I personally find even the beta to be more stable and friendly to my recommended-spec rig than many full releases of other games I've played. Great forum community too and the devs are very open to feedback. There is not quite enough to do yet for freeroam to be worth $30,  but if you are reading this after the full release, then you should buy this!EDIT:Worth noting that the devs are so active on this that right now, only a few weeks after writing the initial review, enough stuff has been finalized or added to the current beta to probably make it worth your $30.

It plays very well. I've not discovered anything that resembles a game-breaking bug, although there may be an issue with some ""deliver cargo"" missions - in that the briefing does not really explain where and what to go/do to complete them. However, clicking the mission-markers on the map and reading their info, you can usually work them out.If you like games like Elite, and Wing Commander, this is a game to keep an eye on, if not buy!

								It's been ages since we've had an excellent free roam space roleplaying game.  While in the current early alpha stage gameplay focuses more on ""make stuff asplode"" rather than ""trade for all the things"", the action gameplay that's already there is right at home with such greats as Starfleet Command paired with the frenetic nature of Freelancer.  Even if you aren't a sci-fi geek (EXCELSIOR!), I'm willing to bet that once you get past the learning curve you'll absolutely love this.Where Starpoint Gemini 1 was rough around the edges and everyone talked in broken English that would make even the European Union cringe, this is a finely-polished brilliant-cut gemstone with actual English-as-a-first-language voice actors -- so if you're expecting your ears to bleed, then you're wrong.  Wrong, wrong, wrong.Also, power-to-engines.  Power-to-engines, omigod, power-to-engines.  Exclam, like, wow, hashtag awesome.  Or whatever the kids are saying these days.			"

												Game managed to get my attention for over 50 hours, however in the end it got a tad monotonous and in the end found it to become rather boring for me. It's not to say this is a bad game. I guess the replayability and scope of what you could do got a tad monotonous in the end.For those who want to fly around shooting up ships, defend stations from attack, upgrade to increasingly better ships which you can customize, it's a good game to have. Graphically it was average to above average for me. At the end of the day, I think there were just many other games out there which drew my interest away from this. 5.5/10			"

												Once upon a time I played a 2D game called ""Escape Velocity"", a game about being a space guy with a ship, going around the galaxy doing things for money and getting involved in various shenanigens.  It was very open, and it instantly made you feel like you weren't just an actor in a story, but a person in a universe.  Maybe you were some poor shlub with a cheap ship just taking whatever work you could get to make a buck, often risking your neck in the process or maybe eventually you were the coolguy captain with a beastly ship deciding the fate of whatever chunk of space you ended up in.  Either way you would be involved in cool space battles, or running in a panic from a situation you couldn't handle, or spending time carefully picking upgrades for your ship, or even buying a whole new ship ( or dreaming about buying a giant really expensive ship ).Starpoint Gemini 2 is the 3D version of that experience.

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is hours of constant enjoyment. I've been wanting a great space simulator for years and this fills that gap. Space combat ranges from you being overwhelmingly powerful and slaughtering a weaker enemy convoy, to suddenly being completely outmatched as hordes of enemy fleets warp in. You'll go from shifting your power-flow to fully charge your weapons; unleashing torrents of weapon-fire and watching enemy ships violently explode, to frantically diverting power to your shields and engines, cutting power from your weapon-batteries to overcharge your engines and jettison yourself free from the firestorm. The space combat, environment, and ships are all wonderful and deserve high praise. The only downfall is the narrative in the story mode. My only noted negative is that the plot dialogue is very poorly written: conversations are written with very simplistic wording, adding unnecessary filler dialogue in the middle of a conversation. The characters have no expression and sitting through the dialogue moments are frustrating to even hear the characters speak. All the character interactions are not written as real conversations, monologues occur at inappropriate times. A complete re-writing of the entire game's plot narrative (by someone with writing experience) would make the game perfect. 8.5/10			"

												Its a decent game. You will probably lose a few hours of your life on it.The good:The history. The controls, very similar to Elite: Dangerous. Lot of ships.Lot of modules.Big space, lot of places to visit...lot of enemies =))Yet to see -> TITANS!!!The bad:The interface isn't intuitive. I'm still trying to find the rank xp bar...The ship loadout interface is a bit o confusing too.Aside from the main history, every mission is the same...Go there and kill someone...We should be able to save it whenever we want, not only inside stations.The worse:For some reason the game freeze at some dialogues and at random points while flying. The only solution is alt+F4.I've looked in the forums but not seems to solve it.If you are looking for something which resemble EVE without the complexe learning curve and a decent gameplay, this is the one. Just be prepared for redo some missions if the game crashes.			"

You can command a mini fleet of 2 other warships. The AI is decent, storyline is phenomenal, gameplay is great! I did not feel like there was any grind at all in this game, making money and moving on to the next level and ship was fast and easy. Game was very intuitive with a very helpful UI, biggest complaint is the blech voiceacting and the horrific accents. Other then that the devs are super responsive and made a great game. I own almost 200 games and rarely give out reviews, when I do I either loved the game or hated the heck out of it. I loved this game and if you enjoyed playing Freelancer, Wing Commander Series including Privateer, this is like those games except on crack.			"

												Good time killer but there are a lot of little bugs that blow it for me. Like mission triggers that don't always work so you can get stuck on missions and need customer support to tweak them. That and the combat is relatively bland, they put a lot of thought into boarding actions and such but its not easy to learn unless you stumble upon a youtube guide, theres no tutorial really for it. Beyond that the enemy AI always hangs out in your blind spot and the dogfighting is very ""meh"" - point and click stuff, doesn't feel like it's skill based you know? Just tell your turrets to go HAM and wait a few seconds for things to explode. Scan anomalies for EXP that you'd otherwise ignore so their ""side effects"" aren't very underplayed.			"

												I love this game but I am tired of games that have ""many ways to make money"" but only one that is effective.Ship that can hold 100 cargo:   Try being a trader at about a 20% return. What this means is if you buy something at 80 and sell at 100 you make 20. You can hold 100 things so you make a total of $2,000   Go mining. Best thing I found to mine sells for 900, get 100. 900x100=$90,000. This takes a lot of time   Go kill guys and loot them for random amounts so lets just say you only save the items worth 2,000+ so call it $100,000 but this takes a lot of time OR   Start the game and as soon as you have control of your ship hang out around a space station and board the weakest ship you can find. Then sell that ship at the space station for $400,000+ depending on the ship.... takes 5-10 minutes or less..... Late game is even worse as you will be selling ships for millions.			"

												i love flying around in space with no loads, but why cant we be in a solar system with a star in the middle and planets going around it, as far as we know thats how all solar systems work, this seems like just random rogue planets totally static in space. minor complaint tho its a great game already and its not even got main missions or even side missions but freelancing is what i wanna do anyway so im loving it, flying between planets and space stations, i just wish the map was the size of the actual universe... is that too much to ask? :)   for me its been a hit amongst a series of bad purchases, its really all im playing right now. i got it for 33% off and it was def worth that for me.   Edit: looks like it is more of a solar system than it looked like early on, the suns help. would be great to get the whole thing spinning, newtonian? capurnican? you know what i mean. maybe for starpoint gemini 3.

												A ""Must have"" for any Space Sim fan, SPG2 manage to deliver that ""freelanceresque"" feeling I've been looking for since... well FL itself. The game still have some things to be ironed out, like ship and weapon balance, trade and mining, and some minor bugs, but the devs are very active and truly listening to the community feedback. With some tweaks here and there this game could be a true successor to FL.You'll get sucked in by the wonderful surroundings, the ambient music, and the attention and love the small team of devs is putting into the game.If you loved Freelancer, you'll love Starpoint Gemini 2.

												I'm going to start this review by being negative. This is not to savage the work that Little Green Men did on this game, but rather to emphasize the positive bits later.""Starpoint Gemini 2"" has some pretty rough areas. The campaign, framed through (sometimes yawn-inducing) text boxes and uneven voice-acting, didn't connect with me very well. There's an interesting twist here and there, but I just couldn't manage to care that much about what was going on. The necessary ""gloss-n-polish"" doesn't exist, especially with the game dialogue writers having a strange aversion to using the word ""the.""The game's difficulty curve is lumpy and strange, with the procedural mission generation apparently taking into account your level, but not what ship you have. This is also aggravated by a lack of mission information. Especially with the campaign, you don't know that much about what you're heading into. It's possible to get to a point where you just ""hit a wall,"" and get thrown into an engagment that you simply can't win without (at least) having gotten into the next class of ship. There's nothing wrong with this if you have some sort of warning, but for it to happen suddenly and with no advance notice is a kind of ""fake difficulty"" that I dislike.(I can appreciate a game that's not interested in hand-holding, but there's also a point where it all turns into sloppy experience design. ""Freelancer"" got this right by walling you off from taking the next campaign mission if you didn't have the prerequisites. ""SG2"" gets it wrong by basically telling you nothing aside from the story's flavortext. I simply don't equate legitimate game challenge with failing to communicate effectively.)I finally got to the point where seeing what happened next in the story was insufficient incentive to work my way up to a more durable spacecraft.But here's the thing - the above happened more than once. This is where things go positive; That I got pulled back into the experience is a testimony to just how well the basic gameplay loop was crafted.What the developers really managed to do beautifully is to create an addicting ""travel, do, upgrade, repeat"" cycle that keeps dragging you back in. The space you fly through is nicely crafted, with a sense of scale that is large without having interminable length between interesting features. The combat is generally satisfying (as long as you're not in a situation where it's overwhelming), and the other game mechanics manage to be pretty deep without being clunky or hard to get your mind around. Other free-roaming space games give you all kinds of controls, and then those controls don't behave consistently (or at all) as you expect. This title, on the other hand, is very solid in terms of behaving intelligently when you give commands.If Little Green Men Games built a sequel that was basically the same core mechanics, but with a far more refined mission (both campaign and procedural) experience, they would be in the same league as ""Freelancer."" The foundation is there - it just needs to be built upon. "

												I bought this game during a Steam sale not expecting too much of it, but it's had me hooked for weeks now. It's fun to play and offers you a lot of things to do and ways to play. For instance, you can focus on the story, pirating, freelancing or trade goods that you either buy legally or gain by looting other ships. You can even specialize in mining asteroids and gasclouds and sell the gains. Or do all of the above!The game gets updated regularly and now has a very extensive tutorial library to help new players get started. You're able to customize your ship's weapon loadout and, to a certain level, it's color and decals.The only things I've noticed so far that could be improved is the voice acting in the storyline (which is pretty hilarious at times) and weapon impact effects. The latter look really poorly done compared to the sleek and smooth ship designs, explosions and absolutely beautiful galaxy you travel through.Oh, and the main menu music alone could have made me buy this game, just thought I'd mention that too.

												Bought this game in Early Access ~3 years ago.  Been playing it off an on.  I doubt I'll ever get over 200 hours but that doesn't mean I don't like the game.  It's amazing seeing how barebones it was back then come to life - as in, freelance missions gave you like 1000 credits and a few dozen XP. Half of the interface was useless and many things were still placeholders.  It's neat to come across a large battle and swoop in to help or to loot.Quick list of pros/cons+Beautiful environment+Living world+SPACESHIPS!+SPACESTATIONS!+Many ways to get money/XP-I have zero interest in the Campaign (don't let that sway you; just a personal preference)-In sandbox mode, it doesn't feel as though you're a big part of the solar system, which makes sense. I guess what I was looking for in this game won't be realized until Starpoint Gemini: Warlords.-Damn PTE disrupting pirates.-A few things are underexplained.-Ship size difference is not noticeable enough and was a complaint since Early Access.

												Finally, a game that scratches my decade-long Freelancer itch.But first, a disclaimer. While no longer an Early Access title, Starpoint Gemini 2 - as of October 2014 - is not quite the finished article. The game still has a number of items turned off in the options menu. Certain gameplay features seem to be half-finished, and the AI does not seem to be taking advantage of all the tools available in combat. In fact, many newcomers are bound to be turned off by the obtuse UI design and the text-heavy, non-interactive tutorials that spit out seemingly unending streams of text on things they have no idea about.Get past the initial frustrations, however, and you will find an absolute gem of a timesink. SG2 nails the three key elements of a good space sim: simple controls, a massive universe full of activities, and a million paths to success on your own terms. Starting off in a tiny gunship and a poorly-voiced campaign mission, you are quickly set loose and given freedom to roam the absolutely gigantic map to mine, trade, explore and fight to your heart's content. Veteran X players may be disappointed by the comparatively static world, limited fleet building options and inability to set up your own industrial empire in the stars, but everyone else should be more than satisfied with the wealth of choices at hand. This is more than worth it at full price, and absolutely unmissable in a sale.			"

												This game is fun for a little while but there's so little variation it gets very tedious, which is a shame becuase the game mechanics are good.Cons:There are three quests you can do: 1)Go here and kill these guys.2)Go here and scan this anomaly.3)Go here and take stuff over there.In order to make money you can either grind for days ferrying junk around, or buy a few upgrades for your crew and start hijacking enemy ships.  The former will take hours before you can buy your next ship, the latter will take minutes.  Rinse and repeat and winthin one afternoon you have the biggest, baddest ship with all the best hardware.There's no variation across the map: each sector feels identical.  I guess in real life the universe is very homogenous but you probably shouldn't use WMAP as your basis for a space RPG.The voice acting is pretty dull.  You can tell the actors aren't at all enthused by the story and nor was I.Pros:You can adjust the power balance of your shelds, weapons and engines, giving you a more hands on approach to aggresion, defence and running away.Each weapon and shield module has its own power and can be drained if over taxed during a fight, forcing you to keep manouvering to keep your better charged side towards the enemy.  This makes the big lumbering ships more interesting to play.You can take your unstoppable death machine, paint it shiny pink and name it ""Winnie the Pooh"".Summary:The game world is too big and too bland.  If the devs had put the effort into writing a better story and varying the world rather than inflating it, this game could be great.  Otherwise it feels more like work than fun.			"

												What i liked:- Multiple options for combat (capture, shoot them up, cloaked assisn)- Vast universe with multiple factions- Many interesting travel options (jumpgates, gravity anomalies, wormholes, speed boosters and jumpdrive)What i disliked:- Poor storyline and terrible voiceacting- Horrid combat balance based on owned ship (if you have a tiny gunship and upgrade to a corvette or a frigate, suddenly all the enemies upgrade equally and you get blasted to smitherines in a matter of seconds)- Enemy difficulty based on player level (why on earth would i take a +xp perk - if i want increased difficulty i just do so in the option menu)- Due to scaling enemies almost instantly have many more troops in their ship than you can hope to send, which makes the troop capture option obsolete- Sinle use boost.. make them cost more (-> multiuse with cooldown) and dont make me run around half the universe looking for the ones i use- Class based skills - useless at best, let me at least replace them with usable items (boosts)SummaryI might give this game a thumbs up once balancing issues have been adressed and class skills make a difference.

												As a sequal to Starpoint Gemini it's beginning to look good... In a nutshell, they did a great job on the graphics and the 3rd dimension in the 3D environment can now actually be used. They also took away the seperate sectors and merged them into 1, with sometimes undesirable lag but no more loading screens and the feel of a huge area to play around in. Big plus there.The gameplay has suffered greatly though, as you can no longer buy/sell individual ship systems as would in the previous game, since a somewhat different system has been employed, but worse yet, there no longer is a significant subsystem targeting system, but from what I understand that is yet to be implemented.Bare in mind though that this is still in Beta when this was written, but it should give a general idea about what happened. With Starpoint Gemini in mind, I am a little bit more optimistic compared to my last edit. I did love that interface, but that's gone...			"

												Had to write a review because I looked and saw that this game was getting really negative reviews. I think that most of these come from skewed expectations. The game, is fantastic, but not for everyone. If you are expecting an Eve style game: turn around and walk away. If you are expecting an Elite: Dangerous style of game: turn around and walk the other way. If you are expecting a Freelancer style game: then come right on in and enjoy the ride. I'm a pretty big space junkie, even bleeding into the mobile area *gag reflex*, I know. But when I'm not playing some space game on my PC, I'm playing Galaxy on Fire on my phone. As far as the game goes don't expect much ""dogfight"" type flying and combat. While there is a small amount of that in the early game, very quickly it turns into a game with battleships and cruisers, where the tactic is to broadside your adversary rather than run at him head on. Being that it is in space, that type of combat is amplified tenfold. Think of a great conflict with you in your dreadnought vs 3 other battleships. You launch fighters and prepare for combat. Being that this is space one of the battleships flys above you, so you rotate your ship so that your port side is now facing the underside of his ship, leaving you with a perfect angle of attack. If that doesn't sound awesome to you than this game is now for you.			"

There is lots of work still to be done to it for sure but with and active community and devs that engage with their customers this is sure to be one of the best space sims around.Defos worth the price, was worth it back when it was in alpha, doubly so nowIf your still not sure feel free to check out my lets play on the game here:

												""Full PTE ahead! Oh wait, Captain there's something wrong..""Honestly, I like it. It's a decent game, it has a strong core and does have entertaining values inside of it. It's pretty, runs well on my AMD machine, and keeps you at least somewhat busy. However, there are some very odd issues and difficulties I have with the game, I'll list them below.Game is too light; When I say this, I mean that the game is not that deep. The statistics for ships is relegated to a few simple stats (such as hull, cargo and crew). I feel that if I'm going to be driving around a big ship, I'd wanna know more about what's going on with it's internal systems. What makes ship A better than ship B? Well look at hull, cargo and troop capacity. That's it. Where's my statistics? Scaling for ship size; This is actually a big complaint. The ships don't look..big. They don't have imposing statures or good camera angles. They don't refelct how big (or small) they actually are. I have a small gunship and I'll go past ships marked as frigates or destroyer and I can't tell a size difference. That makes no sense to me. Sure, if I get within ""I'll melt you with point blank lasers range"" I'll notice a very small difference, but otherwise it's hard to tell. Reminds me of Star Trek (the show).Lots of loot, nothing to do with it; There's a plethora of loot in the game. Computers, drugs, minerals and ores. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SELL THEM. You can't craft, you can't allocate them for energy on the ship, they are just fluff. They don't have any real impact on the game other than that they can be sold (and what's worse, caputring enemy ships is far more benificial). I wish there was an in depth crafting system, something. Notifications; The game does not notify you when you pick up loot, meaning, that when I loot a ship with the ""auto loot"" function, it does not tell me what I got! I have to go into my menues and see what was put in. A prime example of how this is bad. I looted a big ship once, got an AMAZING missle system. I didn't know I had it, it never notified me. So I spent 250,000 credits on a missle system (worse by the way) and then, while equping it, realized I had the other one. Bye bye money! Camera angles; Not dynamic, not good. No cockpit view. Sadface.No real interaction with the universe; I will have to state, this is one of my biggest issues. Doing freelance quests gives you no satisfaction. When I'm picking up a VIP to transport, no chat initiates. It's a simple grab and go. Even the quest text is shallow. ""Pick up A, drop off at B."" There's no context as to what I'm doing this for. When I have a mission to go kill some pirate, there's nothing to it. It's just ""We of the Such-and-such want Pirate dead"". That's it! There's no interaction with the universe around you, it's all text and empty requests. You can't even interact with the ships system officers!! There's never a point where I feel truly a part of a living organism, I feel like the ONLY living organism in the game.Difficulty; Thus far, it makes no sense. I'll take on a quest to kill a pirate that's my level. Then I'll go to said zone and find that the pirate has two or more friends and he himself is listed as ""Impossible"" for my skill level. WHY? The game never notified me on what gear I should have when. The ships I'm going up against are a cool 2-10 MILLION credits, where as in my entire game play, dedicating time to making credits, I've made roughtly 800,000 at most, at one time. I read a forum post stating that some people ran into a sinkhole of difficulty, they leveled up too fast and the game scaled their enemies up too high, too quick. My point is, leveling should be more fluid and less wreckless. Don't allow me to level up to level 20 when I can't afford/fight level 20 ranked ships. EXP needs to be reworked, slow down leveling. Class ""System""; It's strait forward and dull. No real custiomization other than ""Put point here, see marginal benifits"". It's like old school WoW. Funny enough above I listed the games not deep, but it has a +% based level system. That's okay, I get it. But my skills don't feel impact, even against trivial ranked enemies, they still melt through my shield and kill me.I could go on, there's a lot to complain about with this game. However, give it a shot. If you really like space-sandbox-adventure action, you can't go wrong here. But there's better out there. ""General Statement. These are my thoughts on the game. Any opposing or likeminded feelings are welcome to be directed and discussed at me, however, don't be an idiot about it.""			"

												I lost interest in the game although it's quite decent. I tried all type of missions, trading, exploring etc., upgrade ship and weapons. IMHO it needs 3 things..1.) balancing: - railgun weapons are far better than all weapon types (beam, plasma)- some red (high-lvl) missions are easy, got killed on some easy ones (low-lvl)2.) more deep mechanics- trading very stupid (although very effective to earn money till ~lvl10)3.) removing first ?LGM? screen when launching game! - it's very loud forcing me to throw my headpones from my ears in instanceI recommend this game for all space-sim-explorer-lovers not for common player looking for something new..

												Okay, I loved this game.  The ship models are fantastic and deeply customizable.  The ""Heroes"" that can optionally be hunted down have curiously ordinary names and faces - I think I've been killing the developers inside their own game.  The sandbox is massive, and while most of the missions really boil down to ""go here and kill this guy"" and ""go here without getting killed"", the enemies scale well enough that you're never really assured a victory.  Until you get a titan.  I didn't play the first game, but I get the feeling that the Levithan was the final battle.  Building your own ship off of that design, then, really skews the odds in your favor.  Fortunately, this is only an option at the very end, so look forward to scurrying away from enemy reinforcements.  Long story short, this will probably devour almost a hundred hours of your life and you won't resent it for that.			"

												As a sequal to Starpoint Gemini it's beginning to look good... In a nutshell, they did a great job on the graphics and the 3rd dimension in the 3D environment can now actually be used. They also took away the seperate sectors and merged them into 1, with sometimes undesirable lag but no more loading screens and the feel of a huge area to play around in. Big plus there.The gameplay has suffered greatly though, as you can no longer buy/sell individual ship systems as would in the previous game, since a somewhat different system has been employed, but worse yet, there no longer is a significant subsystem targeting system, but from what I understand that is yet to be implemented.Bare in mind though that this is still in Beta when this was written, but it should give a general idea about what happened. With Starpoint Gemini in mind, I am a little bit more optimistic compared to my last edit. I did love that interface, but that's gone...			"

												So I bought this on sale and it was one of those impulse buys, I did not get this game at all when I first tried it, but when I was in a more patient mood to learn the confusing interface I have now started playing it more and actually understand it as I read the tutorials carefully and just got used to everything, there is a learning curve with this game, but considering it's singleplayer so you don't have to worry about player population and it's a really massive space sim it is definitely worth it.Do you remember the days of Freelancer? Well I do and I played that game to death, one of the most fun aspects for me was the huge amounts of factions, the hidden bases, the exploration and the rather limited sandbox experience when it came to trading this game has decided to focus on all of that.I may actually even check out mining properly now, because I remember wanting to do it in Freelancer but because that game was primarily about combat it was all very limited oh and just like freelancer it looks like you mine by shooting stuff rather than having any sort of specialised ship, which, while is a bit silly I do wonder if that's a good mechanic because it means you don't have to worry so much about how to defend yourself in space sims.So to sum this game up, it very much has a learning curve, think of it as Freelancer on steroids because even the steering of your ship is very similar, but once you get into it you'll have no problem getting through the map and the various interfaces loaded with information.If anyone wants a possible tip on getting into the game quicker, I recommend just getting used to using the context menu which you access with the middle mouse button or clicking your scroll wheel. Unlike most context sensitive stuff on games this menu actually seems to work decently and you can use it to quickly navigate around space.			"

												I am really enjoying this game.  To be fair, it has bugs, but overall it is fairly solid.  I used to play EVE Online for several years after it first came out and SG2 does have a *similar* feel.  The controls can be awkward at first, but after you make some fine-tuning on your own it becomes just as intuitive as any other mouse and keyboard based sim.  Note that in the last week+ since it came on steam, the community has been growing rapidly and there is a ton of good information to help new players adjust the game to fit their playstyle in this kind of sim.  If you are having difficulty, please look there and see if someone can help!One of the biggest factors for me is that the devs are continuously fixing the small things *and* the big picture as well.I'm excited to see where the game will go in the future...

												I'm going to try to make this as concise and clear as possible but I have a lot to say. Also note I have not played the main campagn yet although I've put around 30 hours into the sandbox mode.Pros: SG2 has a huge universe with a cool backstory that can be read on the wiki. This game allows you to change alignments based on your actions. For the first 10 hours I was just trying to get to the point where I can strike out on my own as a pirate but ended up feeling that I wouldn't want to betray the people I had been helping the whole time. I'm not RPing as a bounty hunter, hunting down all criminals with a bounty on their head. It's pretty great.The art direction is absolutely amazing. So much so that I got a SG2 background for my desktop. I feel like it really grasps the true beauty of space. The music is deep and emersive and it changes based on the situation in a smooth manner. Cons: The learning curve was pretty tough in the beginning. There was a tutorial but it was kind of a huge wall of text after another.Conclusion: This is a truly amazing game. I wish these devs had an EA budget so they could make even more content. I will definitely be purchasing Starpoint Gemini 3.			"

												I played Elite: Dangerous, then X3AP, then X:Rebirth, went back to X3AP and finally I stumbled on Starpoint Gemini 2. How I came to this game? In elite, I was fascinated by the cool-looking fighters, the dog-fighting with HOTAS controller and hype of Horizon. I soon realised the game was time-consuming and i was unable to accomplish as much as I would expected. I loaded up X3 (I bought during a steam sale) and started playing. This game also had dog-fighting, tons of ship classes but the main draw was the scope and depth of the game. At the midpoint, I coud lead a wing of fighters, setup space stations and managed a fleet of trading freighters. It was really cool but I spent way too much time and the graphics were not as cool. I hopped over to X: Rebirth and got a headache navigating in the engine. I hopped back to X3 for a short while and finally got to SPG2.SPG2 is a Space-Theme ARPG. In free-roam, you control a ship and navigate through a gigantic starchart map. You can pick up alot space-thremed missions, mine asteroids, trade between space stations and planets, be a pirate or police. It cover much of everything you can think of in a space sim game but to a limited depth. I won't not say it is a shallow game because you have a pretty good idea of what a space sim would be like after playing this game.+ Tons of playable ships + Beautiful ship designs+ Space combat is flashy and exciting. + Tons of things to do, you won't get bored of things to do - Limited functionality in several aspect of a typical space sim game - Reputation system, licences and bulletin news interface seems like a mere after-thought - Shield system is surprisingly 2 dimensional - No real space dogfighting - It is definitely not SPG1 or starfleet command - I had this feeling it is designed to be played on consoles since it is evidently simplified, not a good thing for PC players.This game shines when you play at it as a ARPG in a space theme setting and not as a typical space sim. Its greatness comes from the sum of all the parts it has to offer. For its vast contents and production value, I disagree it is a poor man's Free Space.			"

												Pardon the format of my review, I am not formatting it very well.I bought Starpoint Gemini a couple of years back and just could not get into it.  I had put Starpoint Gemini 2 on my wishlist, hoping for a sale.  So I recently bought it on sale and I am find the freeroam mode very satisfying.I started out mining asteroids, then doing missions and all the while figuring out the different mechanisms for the game.  I had googled some ""Getting started"" guides and found out that boarding and selling ships was where most money could be made.  I had changed the game mode to easy, I wanted to check out all the different ships the game has to offer without too much of a struggle.   There is a clear progression with the choice of ships and going from your beginner Gunship and ending up with a Dreadnought is very satisfying.   The controls are a lot like Freelancer. Selling ships and taking out the most wanted from the Bounty board is a sure way to get rich fast.  There are different ""zones"" near friendly space stations that offer baddies from the different factions that are ideal for getting xp and capturing ships and dragging them to the spacestation.   Troopers are the currency that allow you to capture ships, space stations run out of them and then you have to go look for them somewhere else or wait until the space station has a new shipment of them.  I love the map with all the different factions and things to discover, there are structures called artefact vaults where you can collect an artefact, the objective is to collect all 50.  Some special kills (usually baddies from the most wanted board) yield unique weapons with better than average stats and some missions/kills yield   blueprint for unique equipment.  Most subsystems of  your ship can changed with upgrades that give bonuses.  You also can hire different officers that give bonuses. Furthermore once you reach a certain level,  you can hire mercs that join you so you end up with a little fleet.The combination of different ships (70 apparently), different officers, skills, perks, mercs and equipment and the huge map makes this game a great experience for me. I enjoy the grind of doing missions and capturing ships.   Overall a great Elite clone.  The story is a little thin and the game could use some world-lore detailing the history of the various factions beyond the news bulletins, something like the books in the Elder Scroll games would be nice. Also, the capture/trooper mechanic could be reworked a little, I never understand why some of my troopers still have to die when they are capturing an empty enemy ship.			"

												I got this on sale so my review might be skewed a tad but... HOLY SH*T! A vast galaxy filled with anomolies & hazards to navigate & explore anyway you see fit! Join a faction & mine asteroids for resources & make money! Or join the pirates & take over other ships for your own fleet (or sell them off) for more money! Or go freelance & complete missions for EVERYONE ranging from assasinations to station repair, Escorts & station defense to all round station assault! For bonus money! Or play a dashing rogue! Smuggle illegal contraband into neighboring systems-F*ck the establishment! For even MORE money! With enough weapons & variables to keep you armed & equipped well into the eventual heat-death of the universe, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a fantastic game. It's an absolute must-have when it goes on sale.  However,If I have one proper complaint though it's the voice acting for the single player missions. Long story short, it's bad. Not like Resident Evil cheesy jill sandwich master of unlocking good-bad, it's just bad. Like, people reading off a script for the first time bad. No soul.

												Great game, one of the best, I should put as ""not recommend"" because of compatibility issues with some graphics cards that are the economic reality of my country because we can not pay for here more than US $ 70 in a graphics card, because boards $ 300 arrive at the price of a car close to $ 1600.If not for such technical misfortunes would have kept the game but the developer contacted me, which I found surprising, made some changes and even helped me in configuration, but unfortunately the problem persisted.I'd love to stay with the game but unfortunately I can not, maybe in the near future, even with the few minutes I played could delight me with the quality.I'll keep an eye on the game waiting for an update.Thank you all for support.

It's worth playing, but it's got a lot of bugs, a universal reputation system which annoys the crap out of me (you're either a good guy or a bad guy, rather than individual factions liking or disliking you to individual degrees.) It's all one star system - a very full star system, more full than in Freelancer or Eve, but just one rather than a galaxy. Long, poorly voiced, voice overs that can't be skipped. I could go on, but meh.Buy it if it's on sale and try it out.			"

												I lost interest in the game although it's quite decent. I tried all type of missions, trading, exploring etc., upgrade ship and weapons. IMHO it needs 3 things..1.) balancing: - railgun weapons are far better than all weapon types (beam, plasma)- some red (high-lvl) missions are easy, got killed on some easy ones (low-lvl)2.) more deep mechanics- trading very stupid (although very effective to earn money till ~lvl10)3.) removing first ?LGM? screen when launching game! - it's very loud forcing me to throw my headpones from my ears in instanceI recommend this game for all space-sim-explorer-lovers not for common player looking for something new..

												Great game, one of the best, I should put as ""not recommend"" because of compatibility issues with some graphics cards that are the economic reality of my country because we can not pay for here more than US $ 70 in a graphics card, because boards $ 300 arrive at the price of a car close to $ 1600.If not for such technical misfortunes would have kept the game but the developer contacted me, which I found surprising, made some changes and even helped me in configuration, but unfortunately the problem persisted.I'd love to stay with the game but unfortunately I can not, maybe in the near future, even with the few minutes I played could delight me with the quality.I'll keep an eye on the game waiting for an update.Thank you all for support.

												Okay, I loved this game.  The ship models are fantastic and deeply customizable.  The ""Heroes"" that can optionally be hunted down have curiously ordinary names and faces - I think I've been killing the developers inside their own game.  The sandbox is massive, and while most of the missions really boil down to ""go here and kill this guy"" and ""go here without getting killed"", the enemies scale well enough that you're never really assured a victory.  Until you get a titan.  I didn't play the first game, but I get the feeling that the Levithan was the final battle.  Building your own ship off of that design, then, really skews the odds in your favor.  Fortunately, this is only an option at the very end, so look forward to scurrying away from enemy reinforcements.  Long story short, this will probably devour almost a hundred hours of your life and you won't resent it for that.			"

												So I bought this on sale and it was one of those impulse buys, I did not get this game at all when I first tried it, but when I was in a more patient mood to learn the confusing interface I have now started playing it more and actually understand it as I read the tutorials carefully and just got used to everything, there is a learning curve with this game, but considering it's singleplayer so you don't have to worry about player population and it's a really massive space sim it is definitely worth it.Do you remember the days of Freelancer? Well I do and I played that game to death, one of the most fun aspects for me was the huge amounts of factions, the hidden bases, the exploration and the rather limited sandbox experience when it came to trading this game has decided to focus on all of that.I may actually even check out mining properly now, because I remember wanting to do it in Freelancer but because that game was primarily about combat it was all very limited oh and just like freelancer it looks like you mine by shooting stuff rather than having any sort of specialised ship, which, while is a bit silly I do wonder if that's a good mechanic because it means you don't have to worry so much about how to defend yourself in space sims.So to sum this game up, it very much has a learning curve, think of it as Freelancer on steroids because even the steering of your ship is very similar, but once you get into it you'll have no problem getting through the map and the various interfaces loaded with information.If anyone wants a possible tip on getting into the game quicker, I recommend just getting used to using the context menu which you access with the middle mouse button or clicking your scroll wheel. Unlike most context sensitive stuff on games this menu actually seems to work decently and you can use it to quickly navigate around space.			"

												This is my methadone to keep me going until Star Citizen is out.TLDR: It's very relaxing and enjoyable to roam around popping pirate ships, and scooping up their loot while exploring each hex.Theres some nice progression with levels earning you skills and perks to your character.  Meanwhile spend that ill gotten cash to upgrade ship systems, buy fancier guns, and stock up on consumables to give your ship an edge in a fight, or i suppose help miners in their tedious rock popping. Hire troops for the wetwork, bridge officers for passive bonuses, and later on mercenary captains to back you up in a fight. Remember, it's OK to leave them to die.  Ultimately earn enough (or take over!) that fancy new ship you've been eying. There are also purchasable licenses for financial perks like earning extra credits when killing certain factions or cheaper goods from a certain corporation, even passive credits per month so you can sit around and do squat and still earn money just like the one percenter you are.Exploration stays enjoyable by providing several modes of travel.  Pay to use an established warp gate (there's a way to make a one time license purchase to make them free though), or risk some damage and redshirt lives by using wormholes.  There's also these odd green bands of gravitational anomolies than can pull you in and whip you across several sectors very quickly, and finally the convenience of a consumable that will jump you a limited distance but can go from anywhere to any place you've already explored (and have enough drives to reach). It's also financially useful as the more stations you find, the better options you'll have to buy low and sell high with a decent variety of trade goods, some of them illicit in certain regions.I wish the different parts of space were more varied, but at least it's all uniformly pretty with nebulas, asteroid fields, ice asteroids, and clouds of floating junk (all mineable if you're into that sort of thing) to add some variety. There are scannable anomolies, though only a few types and they all just do some sort of passive thing to surrounding space like scramble sensors or block teleporters. Scanning them down will get rid of the field, and earn some xp and credits if its a mission, otherwise they are ignorable.  Some of the more unique stations are very beautiful, like the Spire, but most of the space stuff is pretty samey.Combat is  pretty simplistic you can even (and its recommended) set your turrets to autofire and concentrate on turning your best shields towards the light show. I wish the different guns and damage types were a little more varied. Heavy weapons have limted ammo but help speed things up, and there are some other consumables that can be deployed to help increase offense or survivability.  Spice things up by locking your grappling array on a wounded ship and teleporting over boarding parties of expendable no name grunts who throw their lives away so you can get a big payday.  If you're lucky and manage to successfully take over a ship you get to loot it far more effectively that picking through its wreckage, then tow it to the nearest dock to either add to your stable or sell off. Remember to keep the redshirts stocked every time you come back to port. Out in the stars are a bunch of named elites with bounty's on their heads and suprisingly deadly offensive capabilities to test your mettle. Currently theres no real story, and a very limited number of missions that just help earn credits while doing the things you're already doing, but the foundation that is there is solid and fun, and surprisingly well polished for an early access title.

												first of all i would like to apolagise for a grammar mistakes since english is not my main languagesaying that here is a few thoughts about this game:1. it give u a freedom to do what u want, where u want and how u want. u can folow storyline but in my case i have left storyline for latter on and just explore and freelance around, so a + for a total freedom of a gameplay.2. easy to addapt commands and UI. took me around 30 minutes to catch all basic and advanced commands. so a + for UI.3. decent amount of different electronic music puts me back in my EVE days. not repetative and easy to chill whille u r towing around that heavy merchant filled with goodies to a friendly base. ( yea like in EVE i do pirate alot poor merchants )there are more stuffs, from storyline, choices of a gameplay, etc. i wont bore u guys with that.game is worth the money, it can easy make u to spend 100+ hrs in it. graphic even on low looks awesome, no FPS drops.overall i would give this game a solid 8/10 on freedom of choice/sandbox/visualhope i helped someone :)			"

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			"

I keep wanting to play a little longer instead of doing important things,  like eating & sleeping! I got it on a sale or a bundle, I don't remember which. The price is a little high if it isn't on sale, but I am really cheap when it comes to games, since I do get them where I got this one. I'm glad I own it because it does have decent play value.If you like space shooters, trading, & mining. this is becoming quite polished. I like & recommend it if this type of game is your cup of tea. It doesn't seem to have all of the micromanagement like a lot of games in this genre but they might be there & I haven't investigated the game far enough to find that yet. Not bad at all.			"

								OK, so the game is great. Looks great, sounds great, fun to play, everything about it is awesome.EXCEPT that it's Beta, like really Beta. While it's a fun as hell game to play it crashes pretty consistently every 30 minutes or so. It has done this to me so many times that while I have 11 hours on record with steam I have only actually progressed through the game for 6.5, so just over half. The main reason for this huge loss of time has to do with the save system. It's pretty stupid: you can only save while docked, and (right now at least) you loose those missions (not failed, you loose access to those missions as if they never existed) so every time the game crahes before I can save I loose whatever time I invested into the game.So consider this game in an update or two. Or play at your own risk. Granted right now there is no story so you're really loosing free play, which is no real big deal.			"

I wish this game would have a multiplayer (maybe some day?) , i know then it would be one of my favorite games like eve.For Singleplayergame it makes realy fun and looks verry good and its my number one singleplayer game at the momentThumbs up			"

								I don't normally play space related games, nor did I play the first SP Gemini but I decided to give this one a chance based on what I saw and was pleasantly surprised.  Compared to other early access games I wasn't as disappointed as normal, in fact at this point this game could pass as an alpha.As far as the gameplay this is more of a you against the galaxy type of deal, you fly a spaceship, you may have multiple garaged spaceships that you own but (somewhat like ace combat in a way) but it is 100% open*galaxy*.  Normal gameplay consists of going on randomized missions such as assassinate, ferry cargo/passengers, capture ships, smuggle counterfiet goods etc, you level up/rank up and have a skill tree/rank tree.  You may earn money through missions, trading, mining (asteroids and other such objects), plundering derelict ships, and the best is to find rare high level bounty ships which earn you considerable profits.  You spend your money on new ships, ship systems (weapons) and system upgrades.Sorry for the long review but I tried to explain what I would have wanted to see before I bought it (well worth the money by the way!)

								I really like the licenses that you can buy but for the price of the licenses maybe the perk you get when you buy the license  should be increased or the prices of the licenses lowered.the auto-pilot is awesome and sometimes theres nothing better than just drifting through space but at times i find it a bit uneventful, other than the stunning scenery and the the enemy factions and pirates that you run into theres not much else that makes the trip exciting. maybe turning the autopilot off when the ship has to travel through asteroid fields or maybe even grouping the asteroids closer together so that the ship has to be manouveredthe map is really easy to read and finding my bearings isnt a problem, i have played similar games and have found them vey complicated, i find this one the easiest to understand and play but its not to say that its not a very challenging game although  a better tutorial could be made. i found the current tutorial a bit too much to remember at once.all in all it is an amazing game and i would recomend it to all my friends. i am curious to see multiplayer or even mass multiplayer capabilities. the graphics are a 10/10 and the ship controll is challenging but fun to master. it would be great to see a few more classes introduced as well.

								Covers areas that the big boys in space simulations seem to be leaving behind. Quite a nice game and very playable. At the moment includes only one scenario - free roam- but that has a ton of stuff to do in its own right. freelance missions as areas of the gemini sector are opened(though these could pay better), mining, bounty hunting, trading and combat. healthy traffic all round means you dont quite feel alone as in most space sims of this scope. Brilliant ship design, all round good graphics and effects and nice sound which does a greta job of immersing the player.

								Wow.. this has got to be one of the best games I've ever played.As of now (as in Beta Stage), there is only the free roam mode available without any campaigns.From what I can tell there will be more features such as fighter/bomber wings and cloaking devices that have yet to be implemented.But even at this stage the game hosts a repertoire of very very cool features and effects.The game runs smoothly even on my laptop, has amazing graphics, and the spaceships look very beautiful and there are a great variety of them.All this game needs now is a good storyline and it will be legendary! (The developers are working on this right now I believe)Thank you for such an amazing game, and I definitely recommend this game to everyone :)			"

								 I'm new to Steam and one of the first games I searched for was Freelancer, no luck there unfortunatly. So I was keeping an eye out for a similar, if not even better after ten years, replacment for my space combat kicks. The vids on the Store page for Starpoint Gemini 2 look amazing, it seemed to tick all the boxes.  Regardless of your Class you start with an awesome ship, it reminded me of B5s WhiteStar. It's a beast, easily crushing the initial waves of pirate scum who think they're hard enough. As you progress slightly you come up against larger foes and more drawn out battles that require a little more thought. You can upgrade your weapons or change them out, improve your crew to improve your boarding party and the idea of having a Merc fleet to command sounds great. There is a very solid foundation for an epic game here.Combat is on the whole more tactical than Freelancers wild dog-fights, although in fairness I'm not expecting a Cruiser or Frigate Class ship to turn on a dime like a Fighter. A bit more pace wouldn't hurt though. There is currently no story mode and I didn't think I would miss it so much untill it wasn't there. The good news is that it's yet to come, so that's really something to look forward to. For the the time being however, I'm done flying about on other faceless peoples errands as it really has no impact on the greater Galactic Goings-On. The Devs have done a superb job so far but they've a real task ahead to fill out Gemini and the players role in the galaxy.			"

								Not normally I do any sort of reviews, played this one well into the night, grant you its beta, but you should get it whilst its on offer very enjoyable, with freedom to explore and decide which missions to accept.  Just needs a few brush up on the economic system.  Hard to tell whether you are getting a loss or a profit on each trade, a plus or minus on the items in cargo should do it.  Yet to commandeer a ship or salvage any derelicts though but gobbling up the hours here.			"

So if you like space simulations....try it ....for me its worth it. ...			"

								What a stunning little Space Sim this is. Even at this very early stage you can see the great potential there is. There is a level balance between RPG and shoot-em-up to keep most people happy. Again even at the early Beta stage there are enough elements to keep anyone occupied for a good few hours and the re-playability is already there.This will fill the gap and run along side Star Citizen (when it is released). It would be even better with MP as well as the normal SP mode, but hey it may be modded in or even added at some stage.Great little buy.			"

Early Access Review
								Right off the bat, this sequel is markedly superior to its predecessor without even being complete. Graphics, interface, play controls, sound, and music are all better. As it stands now, SPG2 is a somewhat plain but serviceable space sim. You can play in a 'sandbox' mode, roaming the system exploring, trading, pirate-hunting or doing freelance missions and work your way up to bigger and better ships. The game's 'RPG class' system has been implemented, allowing you to choose one of three captain 'types', each with four distinct skills, and there is an array of perks that you can choose from to customize your character.  Navigation and combat are straightforward and can be mastered fairly quickly.There are still a number of annoying bugs and alot of memory leaks, so it tends to be up to chance whether you'll have a stable experience or a lot of crashes. Certain aspects of the game design (particularly the economy and enemy AI) still have to be tweaked and balanced. That being said, the game is still heavily in development (just entered beta stage) and many planned features have not yet been implemented. SPG2 is nowhere near complete, and yet I feel it is still good enough to provide an engaging experience. The dev team is clearly enthusiastic, determined, and appreciative of all their beta testers - they are definitely quick to respond to forum threads and e-mails and are quite good about accepting feedback and suggestions. I definitely think that Starpoint Gemini 2 is worth picking up if you are a fan of immersive space combat/starshiip command sim games, even in its early, unpolished state. It is an enjoyable, well-designed product with a lot of potential that will surely be realized in the near-term by a dedicated and passionate team of developers.			"

Its got the resourceyness and good mission flow you want, with a list of well designed ships you'll always be drooling over. Mechanically some parts are a little clunky just yet (boarding and such) but, seeing as how its still very much a beta, I'm sure they'll iron out the kinks. All in all a VERY fun game!			"

								I purchaced this game just a few days after it was released as an alpha. While i tried many times to play it, i never really got into it. I found the tutorial annoying. I'm not a fan of pop ups after all. So i shelved it for some time. After it went beta, i gave it a go again, and i must say, im very impressed with it. The graphics are decent, it has endless gameplay, with trading, missions and hunting the space rift raft. One complaint i do have is it seems when you enter a planet or station, time outside is mearly paused until you exit again. I really wish there was still time elapsing while you are docked. Perhaps im missing something, but that is how i understand it. Overall tho, if you are a fan of space games, this is a decent one to give a go. I am pleased with the direction the game is going.

								For a beta this is a stable experience. So far I have 6 hours in and no crashes. Fullscreen and in a window on an Win 7 x64 install; AMD FX4130 Quad core 3.8hgz 8gb, Radeon HD 7700 4gb.  Holding my interest even without a storyline but I wonder if Ill be done with it as soon as the map is explored to return for a well fleshed out full version. There is certainly an enthusiastic and active community with recent relevant posts.Whilst looking for a space or 4x or Freelancer fix this won out over Space Engineers and Mission to Mars by a gnats ♥♥♥. They are still in the oven. This seems playable and solid with a developer that is working on a 4x game as well. That just put me over the top.Gameplay doesnt feel like a time sink so far. The hud layout covers the basics for letting you know whats going on. Navigation and camera took some getting used to. The combination of mouse follow (toggle space bar) and camera view (toggle TAB) threw me at first. The depth of menus (ship, officers, fleet) makes traveling to a remote station worthwhile if not for a trade then perhaps some rare talent or other. Im just scratching the surface and have to note the AI ship voice doesn't annoy the crap outta me and is useful as I tool around with this for the first time.			"

There are 100% lesser bugs than x-rebirth and 100% more fun exploring the galaxy and doing freelance missions. Even the Ai is not that tough and  graphics are kind of oldschool (remember: it is still in early access) it is  GREAT!!! Can't wait until it is finished!!!

								A space shooter that is good fun. You should definately RTFM because it is not a jump in and play sort of game. You can do that,  but you will miss out on many features . I keep wanting to play a little longer instead of doing important things,  like eating & sleeping! I got it on a sale or a bundle, I don't remember which. The price is a little high if it isn't on sale, but I am really cheap when it comes to games, since I do get them where I got this one. I'm glad I own it because it does have decent play value.If you like space shooters, trading, & mining. this is becoming quite polished. I like & recommend it if this type of game is your cup of tea. It doesn't seem to have all of the micromanagement like a lot of games in this genre but they might be there & I haven't investigated the game far enough to find that yet. Not bad at all.			"

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.			"

												Pros: Plays like Freelancer, in that you trade, kill, or quest to buy better ships and weapons - except if you are patient enough, you can get from one end to the other on engines alone.That is, of course, assuming that you do not encounter any enemies or anomalies along the way that will screw you over.Cons: The voice acting is laughably horrible and the lines themselves are poorly written. It's like a B-/C+ grade movie. Not to mention the typos, the faulty delete button which doesn't work, and the ""Active Only"" filter which, again, doesn't work.Bottom Line: Get it anyway. The dialogue and voice acting is, ultimately, a minor issue.			"

												first of all i would like to apolagise for a grammar mistakes since english is not my main languagesaying that here is a few thoughts about this game:1. it give u a freedom to do what u want, where u want and how u want. u can folow storyline but in my case i have left storyline for latter on and just explore and freelance around, so a + for a total freedom of a gameplay.2. easy to addapt commands and UI. took me around 30 minutes to catch all basic and advanced commands. so a + for UI.3. decent amount of different electronic music puts me back in my EVE days. not repetative and easy to chill whille u r towing around that heavy merchant filled with goodies to a friendly base. ( yea like in EVE i do pirate alot poor merchants )there are more stuffs, from storyline, choices of a gameplay, etc. i wont bore u guys with that.game is worth the money, it can easy make u to spend 100+ hrs in it. graphic even on low looks awesome, no FPS drops.overall i would give this game a solid 8/10 on freedom of choice/sandbox/visualhope i helped someone :)			"

However if your looking for a dogfight space sim then this isnt it. You get to fly huge ships which are more like gigantic gun boats. The voice acting is terible but dont let that put you off as the core gameplay is solid.

The game does feel lifeless sometimes as you do't really commincate with anyone, be it friendlies enemies or neutrals.

												This game really scratches the Freelancer itch.  It's fairly easy to pick up, although I wish it had a better tutorial.  One of the early main campaign missions tells you to do something, but did not explain how to actually do it.  After stumbling my way through that it's been fairly smooth sailing. It's fairly easy to make cash, and the missions are fairly fun.  I did have a couple of crashes, but they were few and far between.  The autosave system when you land somewhere works well, and ensures that even if you do crash, you don't lose much progress.Overall, I'm really enjoying this game, and it was worth picking up.			"

								Holy ♥♥♥♥.  Ok this game is going to be very good when it's done but at the moment it is completely unplayable.  I have a very good P.C with 12gb of RAM that runs everything else I have at maximum settings with no problem.  When I first downloaded and started the game it was working reasonably well with only the slightest lag when I approached different bases and planets.  As soon as I started getting into battles with other ships the frame rate dropped down to what I swear must have been 2fps!  Frequently it would just freeze for 5 or 10 seconds straight before moving again!  I of course decided to reduce all of my graphic settings down to minimum in the hopes of speeding up the frames.  It made no difference at all!  Maybe not everyone is having this same problem but trust me my P.C should be more than adequate to run this!Besides this though the game is visually very cool and the combat is enjoyable.  They're doing a lot of things right I just wish I was able to actually play it properly right now.(update): After starting the game again today it has been working much better for the time being.  Something strange did happen however.  I suddenly had an extra 5 million credits when I had only had about $9000 when I had quit previously.  Furthermore I didn't even make 5 million credits in my first 2 hours of gameplay.  It was certainly a welcome glitch but I don't think that was intentional.  I have changed my review to a thumbs up as the only problem I previously had with the game at all was the performance issue and hopefully that only occured because it was my first time playing the game after installation.

												Game is very good for awhile, nice amount of things to do. Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.But eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think). But I hit a point where the after reaching the 4 edges of the map, there was simply nothing else to do but even that is not bad, it's the feeling that nothing you do has any effect. Even trading seems to have no effect on prices or anything from what I can tell. I totally recommend it. But with the caveat that you too may hit this point where it just stops being interesting.

								Starpoint Gemini 2 is what all space adventure games should strive to be. Highly replayable adaptive and immersive ,S♥♥♥♥llows the player to take on the universe as the captain of one of a large number of customizeable ships. Enjoy sailing through the stars as a trader, Battle as a bountyhunting captain collecting your bounties or many other play styles. This game allows you to delve deeply into the story and feel like you are your character. I reccomend this game the devs are active and little time goes by without some fix being implimented. I have played many finished games that are less complete than this Alpha. Give it a try .			"

												I originally purchased this game during Early Access and have not been disappointed with the released product.  This title is a fine choice for those who enjoy an RPG in which one can be a starship captain.  With a wide variety of ships and missions, as well as Steam Workshop integration, there is a great deal of replayability.Having stated that, I recommend purchasing this game on sale, as the retail price is a bit steep.  I have noticed some minor graphical bugs, but nothing I would consider a ""show stopper"".  If you enjoy space captain RPG's with replayability, I recommend considering this particular title.			"

												This space simulation starts off a little slow but is a lot of fun once you get up and running. Think of it as a simplified version of the X series.  There seems to be a lot of things that aren't quite finished or shallow, but the developers have been quite activate in adding new content so far.  At this time, theres enough content to get about 25-35 hours worth out of this title at a minimum. Its very sandbox-y with an average story thrown on top.  The storyline itself was interesting, but the voice acting was pretty awful.  All in all, I'd recommend it only if you are into space sim games.			"

												I'll cover the game, but first I need to talk about the developers.This game is helmed by the best company/team I've ever encountered in a long time. They work & worked very hard on this SG2 which was even a joy to play incomplete in the earlier betas - constantly (like to the point of how do you get any work done?) reading, replying, and participating in forum discussions. They entertain ideas for how to approach planned features & possiblities of integrating new ones. This game is far from done in their eyes, and we are all excited to see how SG2 evolves over the long run.Oh yeah, the game: The graphics are awesome. The difficulty is varied enough to appeal to everyone (I'm in the extreme club, and find it quite challenging at times). You feel the constant itch to explore as available ship components, slot enhancements, crew officers, mercenaries, and new ship models differ between areas - and buying a ship direct from the manufacturer is cheaper than buying 3rd party from a different faction.Don't want to or can't buy a ship (because that faction hates you)? Grind rep and switch sides, or just board and capture the ship for yourself. Want to mine asteroid fields? You can do that. Want to capture ships and sell them for millions? You can do that too. Want to hunt down obsure achievements? They're here.And this game is only going to get better.Positive+ Awesome community+ Gameplay rewarding proper piloting+ Mod support (check out sound, graphics, and UI mods)+ Craftable rare drops (blueprints) that feel as good in use as they are frustrating to get+ Power management+ Huge map+ Wormholes!+ Great music+ Interesting campaign storylineNeutral+/- Slow start - it's very hard to begin classing up in ships, especially for new players. There are guides, but there is a bit of a grind. I like the payoff feeling from earning your way. Others will just go get a mod that gives them 1 billion credits. I suggest learning.Negative- Voice acting (there is a mod that improves a bit).- Illegal goods priced roughly equivalent to expensive legal goods.- Trade market prices could be more varied for better profits.- Few factors past pool numbers for shields and hulls.- Unrealistic aggro (2 gunships will ""think"" they can take on your dreadnought and rip you out of cruise speed).

												This game is super fun; I like Star Trek, Firefly, Cowboy Bebop, etc. and when I'm in that mood SG2 in perfect. Every time I resume my game the first thought I have is that this is a great, immersive game. It's really frustrating to see negative reviews because I love this game so much. The developers continue working on it and it keeps getting better which is really saying something since I loved it at early access. recommend for any sci-fi fan that wants a single player open world experience with a ton of ways to play. It's viable to be a miner and buy ships and outfit them just for that. I personally spent several fun hours just doing that, it was great. You can buy and upgrade ships just for smuggle or escort or freelancing. People complain about the expense of ships versus reward of missions; these people simply don't get it. There are lots of ways to build your bank roll and the time and effort it takes make the game more rewarding and immersive. The balance makes it so much better as you progress, you can't just jump from the first ship to the most powerful ship or even the most powerful weapons right away, and that is good. You actually get to enjoy and explore each level of progress , as you get a new ship, or a new upgrade and you slowly work toward that next purchase. All the while playing however you want, avoiding combat in favor of mining and trade which is super fun, figuring out how to avoid destruction or detection while making the kesel run in under 3 parsecs. Or you can be a pirate, good or bad, hijacking ships with a ship optimized just for that sort of activity. So good. So highly recommended.			"

The story in the game isn't the best but it gives you the out line and everything and you can do the story mission on your own time and do other things you want to do like trading of killing or capturing ships and than selling the ships or put them in your port, Mining or gas mining or side missions or a lot of little missions from different companys. The controls are supper easy for me at less i use the mouse 90% of the time. i have taking some pictures of the game. When you start off save your money for your first few ships is hard to do but its fun to do. As it sits at 32.4 hours in the game i have almost 50mil saved. The ranking system in the game it like every 5 or so levels you go up your rank goes up, I'm almost level 35 as of the time i posted this.			"

												If you enjoyed Freelancer, you'll love this. Many similar mechanics, with great ship customization. Maneuvering in space to get the best angles during a fight are fantastic, and managing your troops and ship's abilities and shields make every fight unique and fun.The story mode has bad writing and worse voice acting as well as being quite linear, so I'm mostly using it just for the experience to get bigger and better ships.The most frustrating bit of the game are the crashes. I've yet to have a single play session which didn't crash on me aty least 3 times. You'll be in the middle of a huge fight, and the game will suddenly die. The best thing the Devs did was implement auto save whenever you visit a space station or planet. But if you get in a middle of a big fight out in space and suddenly the game locks up, God help you.-- Edit: I wrote this mini-review/opinion piece a while ago, and the game is far, far, far more stable. Over the time since it was written, the Development team have been awesome in their implementation of not only new features, but bug fixes. The aforementioned random crashes are gone. Thoroughly enjoy this game.			"

Early Access Review
								Holy ♥♥♥♥.  Ok this game is going to be very good when it's done but at the moment it is completely unplayable.  I have a very good P.C with 12gb of RAM that runs everything else I have at maximum settings with no problem.  When I first downloaded and started the game it was working reasonably well with only the slightest lag when I approached different bases and planets.  As soon as I started getting into battles with other ships the frame rate dropped down to what I swear must have been 2fps!  Frequently it would just freeze for 5 or 10 seconds straight before moving again!  I of course decided to reduce all of my graphic settings down to minimum in the hopes of speeding up the frames.  It made no difference at all!  Maybe not everyone is having this same problem but trust me my P.C should be more than adequate to run this!Besides this though the game is visually very cool and the combat is enjoyable.  They're doing a lot of things right I just wish I was able to actually play it properly right now.(update): After starting the game again today it has been working much better for the time being.  Something strange did happen however.  I suddenly had an extra 5 million credits when I had only had about $9000 when I had quit previously.  Furthermore I didn't even make 5 million credits in my first 2 hours of gameplay.  It was certainly a welcome glitch but I don't think that was intentional.  I have changed my review to a thumbs up as the only problem I previously had with the game at all was the performance issue and hopefully that only occured because it was my first time playing the game after installation.

												Game is very good for awhile, nice amount of things to do. Great controls, upgrades, options and visuals.But eventually, it's not the repetition of missions that grows old, it's the feeling that nothing around you changes, you can't own anything, build anything, destroy anything, push enemies back. So eventually becomes very stagnant. I totally get the dynamic stuff would be hard to implement, but then perhaps an easier way to liven things up is to throw in some random stuff like starports getting blown up (then coming back online after repairs), or certain races getting push back into the fringes or something. You can basically just settle into trading and fighting between two starports and essentially, aside from the background visuals not being different than another area... that.. is all the game becomes.  It's too bad because it has great potential and I admitedltly spent hours upon hours playing this game (65 I think). But I hit a point where the after reaching the 4 edges of the map, there was simply nothing else to do but even that is not bad, it's the feeling that nothing you do has any effect. Even trading seems to have no effect on prices or anything from what I can tell. I totally recommend it. But with the caveat that you too may hit this point where it just stops being interesting.

												If you are into sims (as in simulating [duh] or role playing) this is a great space game. It is - as far as I can tell at this point - single player only and it reminds me of EVE from CCP but more beginner-friendly, although still not easy.If you dislike grinding, abort immediately. You'll grind A LOT. I find it worth, the ambiente is amazing, the somewhat small storyline is interesting (if you read and listen) but the action you take is repetitive. I read a lot about bugs, but have not encountered any yet (~29h). Every item has a nice description that is not generic, for example for the solar panels it says that they ""are an important part in Gemini due to the dual star system"" or similar.Workshop is available, you can get your Star Wars or StarTrek sounds, ships etc.__e.: My savegame was corrupted (after loading into the save a mission I wanted to accept was invisible), I do not know what happened, but the guys at LGM looked at the savegame and repaired it! That is some awesome dedication. Great game by great people!			"

												This is exactly the type of game ive been looking for.First time i played i went straight for freeplay without any knowledge of how to play, no tutorial or anything.But i must have done something right because in the first 5 minates i somehow turned every allied sector i flew though to hostile and ended up getting stalked across the entire galaxy by Cruisers destroyers with absolutly no knowledge of what i did wrong or how to fix it.Finaly, a challange worthy of my skills... untill about half an hour later of non-stop warp trying to find somewhere safe where i somehow entered a radioactive nebula that melted my ship around me and i was forced to start a new game.10/10			"

												If you missed the sale recently, wait for it to come around again. Obsessively wait.This game was fun before I got to the modding community, but afterwards this game is awesome. Anyone looking for a good space ""do what you want"" sim will be well rewarded with the purchase.If you're into the Star Trek experience, then look no further. Best game for individual space ship combat in a Star Wars theme since Bridge Commander. Way better than that MMO I tried briefly. Some of the mods that I recommend for Star Trek immersion include: Federation Fleet, TNGAmbience, and TNGComputer.			"

												Bad  default controls somthing that makes or breaks a game like this, a  UI that dosn't behave and is tiny and unreadable @ high res's.And 30fps lock with V-sync enabled, so must force it off if you want to play at all in a non stutter 60fps+++ rate, enjoy the screen tearing.Just Can't Get into this game with the bad targeting and ship controls that don't make sense its like the developer never played another space sim.  I've tried, but the default control mappings are bizzare, they don't align with any other sim of this type, combine that with the UI that is nearly unreadble, and trying to figure out what does what is a pain. You would have to remap every control in this game to make it playable, and then you would still need to figure out what the near unreadble UI is trying to tell you.			"

												I had fun tooling in this game.  It's got a good sense of progression, and it's not exactly lacking in depth or scope. One complaint is that it's not as polished as it could be.  Released in 2014, you can tell a lot of great art and design work was put into this game but it's already starting to show it's age.  I personally compare it to a game like Elite Dangerous, which has a high amount of finish and looks great, but is ultimately a very boring game which lacks depth and has a very frustratingingly long grinding progression. Starpoint Gemini on the other hand, has better pacing.  While it may not be as technically complex or broad in scale, it's a good break as a single player game.			"

												Great space exploration game, the storyline is enjoyable but not extremely content packed and not very interesting. The best part of the game is really exploring the very large map and choosing your own path, you can be whoever you want to be in a vast variety of ships and missions in different regions on the map.I have also had a lot of fun customizing my ship, whether that be the colors of the ship, or the weaponry on board, to the name of the ship (The SwagginWaggin)... I have also enjoyed aligning myself with the various factions, there seem to be at least 30-40 of them.Pro's --> Great space exploration game, complex enough to make it enjoyable for more experienced gamers but also doesn't have a huge learning curve.Con's --> Storyline is pretty weak and the quests and farming for gold can get a little repetitive if you don't enjoy the exploration aspect too much.7/10			"

At first it takes a while to get used to the controls and fight effectively with a style you like but once you play out a few battles out you will find a control style that suits you and probably end up switching between them depending on the situation and the ship you are using.The graphics and interface are really nice and the game runs very well on my medium system which is an AMD APU with integrated graphics.The sound effects are good but some cool warp like sound effect for the t-drive would be nice. The music is very good although perhaps some more variety would be nice especially for the battle music. The story and voice acting is probably the weakest part of the game but the game offers plenty of freedom to explore space and play how you want to. So you can play like a pirate or a trader, mine or do missions etc. There's plenty to do and it's all fun.The game has a nice rpg element which means you can upgrade your skills for when you are in battle and upgrade perks for various different effects like trading bonuses or ship capture bonuses etc. You can customise your ships weapons and buy bigger and better guns and ships as you progress through the ranks and acquire more credits. Overall I would recommend getting this game, especially if you are into space games.			"

Early Access Review
								Okay...I've been playing for a week or so now, and am overall VERY pleased with the game.  There are several bugs that obviously need to be chased down and cleaned up, but if you are a fan of the space (trading) games of the past, then this will win your heart.  There isn't much of a story line yet, but the sandbox (freeform) mode is exceptional, not to mention HUGE!  Did I mention that the map is HUGE?For a fact, there are more opponents, stations, friends, and asteroids to keep you busy for a VERY long time.  It's because the map is HUGE!The game is more akin to Freelancer than to Mass Effect (at least until they get the story part released), and you have so many options to build and customize your ship(s) it's going to make GOTY for space sims.The visuals are a little less important than the action and details, and you get to blow stuff up.  A LOT of stuff.  It's probably because the map is HUGE!Spend the money.  Buy the game.  Enjoy wiping out lots of enemies on the HUGE map. "

												This is a great space combat game, with RPG elements.  Cruising through space, capturing ships, looting and upgrading is a lot of fun.  There are not too many games in this genre. They all seeml to be too old, too complex or they require subscriptions.  Starpoint Gemini 2 is a winner. Short comments on the game:- It is more arcade than simualtion. - The story is not bad, but the presentation is very weak. - At times the voice acting is rediculously bad-  Dont worry about the story becuase the gameplay is engaging and addictive- The graphics are great, minus a few hiccups here and there- Would take about 30-40 hours to play through campaign- Lots to do in this game. DLC is also available and the devs love to support this game- Stop and take a screen capture! F11 will hide all the HUDs so your screen capture comes out like a Carl Sagan wet dream. - The trading and mining is weak, but the value and money making is in capturing enemy ships and selling them and their cargo. Its 5x better than running materials from one side of the map to the other to make money.- There are some great video tutorials on youtube that can jumpstart your ship capturing / pirating skils .  Search: ""Tensiaka"" on youtube for valuable ship cap[turing and combat tutorials,. They helped me a lot. Make a few million in your first couple hrs ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Despite a few flaws, the gameplay, ship options and open world win out.  I  give it   --   8.5/10			"

												I am loving this game - it feels like a mashup of X3, Elite and  a couple of other games.Your starter ship is good mix of everything, good size cargo bay, two weapon points (light - railguns, heavy missiles).  upgrading it is expensive so take care of it.You earn money by trading, completing missions, mining.  You can also try pirating, though this doesn't suit my game play.The universe is a series of hex's that you fly across normally.  Alternatively, their are gateways between locations that require jump drives, worm holes that require increased health (haven't managed to get through one yet) and rift lines, which accelerate your speed whilst you are in the rift.  The subtle difference between worm hole and rift - I think - is that you are exposed to enemy fire in the rift, but not in the wormhole.There is a story (and with the DLC, a second one), but often you will find yourself doing ""things"".  I targeted a level 2 pirate and thought it would be easy, but he called for help, deciding to avoid the agro, I pushed the engines to max, turned and flew through a rift and ended up in the middle of an uncharted system, alive, but with a battered ship.It is a slow paced game - so far at least - but you have to learn that your ship is NOT a fighter, but a small frigate with a crew and gimballed turrets which you can either fire, or have the crew fire.  Later you can buy carrier vessels or cloaked vessels.  You can also command some sort of fleet (hiring mercenaries to accompany you).Like I say, I am loving this.			"

												It's a nice game to just pick up and play, especially when the internet goes down and better games like EVE and Elite:Dangerous are unavailable. Probably one of the closest offline equivalents of the two, and blends the two gamestyles together.			"

												This game could be so great. A real worthy successor for the likes of Freelancer and Privateer but it has so many flaws that it is very close to not being recommendable...I still recommend it though for those in urgent need of a space sim who don’t like Elite: Dangerous and can’t wait for Star Citizen since chances are good that you still will get lost in the vicious circle of just one more mission to be one step closer to the next upgrade/weapon/ship.Let’s start with the good things:I really like the music…ok… that’s not all, there is so much to see and do in this game, too. The galaxy is huge and there are many (unique) space stations and planets to visit, missions to do, artifacts/blueprints to track down and especially ships to destroy, buy or capture. Yes, you can capture enemy ships – in theory – that is one part where the design just doesn’t work out so well, more on that later. You also gain experience and level up which will give you skill points and every 5 level a point for perks. Skills feel rather cheap and bad for me. There are 4 active skills (temporary boosts) you can invest your points in, each skill for one of the available weapon systems (railgun, plasma, beam and heavy (missiles)). So you basically decide which is your favorite weapon system and put your skill points into that skill. Perks are passive but also don’t feel that well thought out. Again you can increase the effectiveness of your favorite weapon system up to 3 times and then there are a lot of semi useful perks to invest in. Additionally you get permanent bonuses by getting (steam) achievements (never seen that before in a game...)The actual space simulation needs to get used to, too. I was expecting a feeling like in the old games and even bought a joystick to get the good old times back, but that just doesn’t work out (for me). The shooting is turret based (you have chase cam and no cockpit view anyway), meaning you can see around your ship and you just move the camera freely and aim with your mouse (depending on the turret placement on the ship). Furthermore the hit feedback is so bad that I quickly decided to switch to beam weapons that are instant hit so I know where I aim is what I hit. Railgun and plasma are projectiles flying somewhere in the direction of the enemy and unless you are not fighting a huge freighter close combat you barely see if you hit or not and especially if not why not (ok, it might just need to get used to but beam seems the better solution). Also you can just tell the system to auto fire (that's why there are acurracy stats you can influence, but I want to play the game as space shooter and not strategy game like star wolves so I don't want to use autoaim...)What is really bad and I don’t understand how the design can fail so hard is that you can’t see your enemy information in the hud. Instead the hud is clustered with stupid, bad looking buttons I barely use (which I could easily access by keys). You only see the enemy information when the enemy is in sight and when he is close it is so fast moving that you can barely read it. So what is happening all the time is: There is a bunch of enemies closing in, you see them in the radar, you can target them (via hotkey) but you have either to start flying into their direction (which is a great idea when it turns out that they are deadly) or switch to turret and target mode and move your camera wildly to get them into focus and be able to identify their threat level. Both very inconvenient since you should be able to quickly cycle through all targets and identify them with one glance. Well perhaps I’m missing something, there even is an info hotkey but it won’t work for enemy ships, only for special objects.The other really bad design issue is the character level system. You level up quite fast and the missions you can get (you don’t have to visit stations to get missions, you will get them while in space, which is good) show the suggested level you should have to take that mission. The problem is: the character level does tell ♥♥♥♥ about your actual strength. That only depends on your ship and weaponry. So this indicator is useless in the first place. Coincidentally it is also useless in the second place because there are types of missions that are just no brainers – regardless of which level they show. If you have maintenance or science missions you just fly to the target, repair or inspect it aaand… it’s done. On the other hand, good luck with rescue or capture missions, which are often impossible even on low level. So the balancing is very bad in general but luckily you can cheat your way out most of the time: Early game you just start your engine boosters and outrun every enemy, mid game they sometimes start blocking your boost mode but you can have a ship with cloaking device by then and just turn that on. Later this doesn't work and thats when you get in real trouble…Talking about capturing… first you can’t capture 90% of the enemies because they have a larger crew than you have (capturing works this way: grapple the enemy with a tractor beam, send troops via teleporter to his ship, if you have more than him you possibly take over the ship). You can focus on capturing by searching for a cheap ship which allows a large army of troopers on board and you can get perks or officers (you can hire 3 officers for your ship, by the way, you can also hire merc ships that follow you and certain ships allow to take fighters on board you can launch during combat so you end up having your own fleet) that give a bonus on the capturing chances.Second most of the time there are other ships around. So even when you manage to find a capturable ship chances are high that it will get blown apart by some other ship nearby. So it is a great feature in theory that just is no real fun most of the time but satisfying when it finally works.Other weaknesses I like to mention:The presentation is really bad. The main story has a ridiculous voice over most of the time, sometimes just dialog (not sure if it is a bug that voiceover is not playing because the music gets muted anyway) and sometimes just a text popup – atmosphere = 0.The balancing of the main and some side missions is also a bad joke. You will be stuck for hours until you have enough money for a capable ship and after you finally progress you often get much easier missions afterwards.The menus are confusing and tedious to use. E.g. you can either sell all cargo or one good at the merchant, but if you have more than 1 of a good you always have to go to the next screen to select how much of the good you want to sell (well everything!). And you will do that a lot because the screen shows if you are having good, mediocre or bad prices so you most likely don’t want to sell the goods with bad prices and rather fly to the next station. I think the ship loadout menu is simply bugged. edit: it is not bugged, turret handling is just another unintuive feature. Also when I unmount a rocket launcher I lose my missiles. The good thing is that I can store my ships with their loadout in my garage and can swap them easily depending on the situation (cargo space/troop count/gun power).But the weapon/ship prices balancing could be much better. The next better systems are so expensive that it takes hours until you can afford something new that actually feels more powerful. The upgrade flow was much better/faster in Freelancer.Last but not least there are that most annoying situations where a cutscene triggers in the middle of a fight, you can’t do anything but the fight continues in the background usually resulting in your death or at least a great headstart for your enemies.So there are many occasions in the game where I ask myself: Did the developers actually play what they created?And then I go back to the game desperately hunting for the next better ship…			"

I like carriers.-very nice devs, that listen to the community, is very, very active on the steam forum/official forum, and overall nice guys-a free DLC (a very large one). The other DLC is for a fee, but add lots of stuff, and they had a free large free patch alongside it. It's more than fair.-a very nice and helpful community.-may sound stupid, but I don't think I've seen 2 station that looks the same. Everything is unique, and it's awesome. -technically, that's not the game itself (beside planets background), but the artworks are gorgeous.Con :-story is meh-voice acting vary a lot, from good to terrible-RPG part is limited, no hero customization for story mode, no choice and impact in the story whatsoever...-no cockpit view. I don't care much, but for some it's an issue. But then, we are flying capital ship, so I guess the cockpit view would look like star trek or battlestar galactica, IE a bridge.			"

												This is a great game with only some minor annoyances here and there. The freeroam aspect is awesome and the ability to break away from whatever you are doing to pursue an enemy, deliver some goods, or just mess around compares to games like the X series. Every ship in the game is flyable and upgradable, and the gameplay is heavily impacted by an RPG skillset and perks that you earn by leveling up. Between the great DLC (both free and paid) and the countless workshop mods, Starpoint Gemini 2 is a game you can easily sink many hours into. Definiately recommended.			"

I have logged around 50 hours and it just gets better and better.The visuals and music are some of the most stunning art I have seen.It's more beautiful than Elite Dangerous even.However, this is not a space sim but a space RPG arcade-ish game with loads of fun and magical experiences.Buy it, you won't regret :)			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is an enjoyable Space Sim, and still looks good for its age, but I wouldn't grab it for the $35 price. It's definitely a game to buy on sale though. Some key points:1. This is a combat focused game. Don't bother trying to be a trader; it won't work, and you can't automate the process like in X3.2. Along 1 above, the primary way you can make money in this game is capturing ships. Unless you want to end up outclassed, learn how to use your troopers and grappling beam. 3. The progression through the classes of ships is well balanced; each feels like an improvement, without any of them feeling redundant.4. Each class of ship does feel unique, and the methodology of flying and fighting in a corvette is distinctly different than in a dreadnought.5. The different models of ships in each class are also rather distinct from one another, and will play well with different tactics. For instance, one ship may have great overlapping fire arcs between the side and front turrets, but have hardly any coverage on the top bottom and the back, while another will offer ballanced coverage over the whole ship, but can't offer the same forward punch.5. Ye gods, the voice acting is TERRIBLE, and the plot is a throw away at best. This wasn't a big issue for me, as the game is mostly free-roam.			"

								IN GAME THE MOUSE WILL NOT MOVE ONTO THE LOWER PORTION OF THE SCREEN. Then I restarted the game, and it looks, like the active-x and direct-x files had to syncronise correctly, which they did, after the second startup. Now it works pretty good, but this is a beta game, and that is why some of the graphics enhancements do not detect as usable, like reflections and shadows, could not be used, but my 2 gig NVIDIA 660 definately has those abilities.Ok that said... Listen up. This game has real potential, because its very open to modding, so it could getvery incredible. There are allready a good number of mods on steam for it, and it's just in BETA...Plus you can use HOTAS joystick to control things. I'm guessing that everything may just end up with beautiful cockpits too for every type of ship.  So get in there and mod and use wordpad !			"

												Amazingly fun early game.Decent middle game.Slow endgame.And I mean slow. Literally. The final ships are next to stationary in combat, and the lack of variety of options in combat makes this quite boring.  As you can only aim a fraction of your turrets at once you're left to turn on auto turrets with large ships which automatically takes care of firing all turrets so you have all your guns firing and just kind of sit there and occasionally use an ability if you need to kill a bit faster.I can still happily recommend this game based on the great early and midgame that's highly reminiscent of Freelancer, but the endgame is poorly balanced and not particularly fun.

												This game a is a tough one to decide. It really isn't a game that I can sit and dump 8 hours into daily like some of the other games I've played, but it is fun to come back to it every once in a while and get my ""freelancer"" fix for the week. I personally found this game to be pretty fun when in sandbox/exploration mode. Story mode on the other hand.. was poorly completed, I believe I spent about 20 minutes in, and dumped it due to the appalling voice acting and poorly scripted story.  Now for sandbox I loved flying around blasting and capturing ships to sell at the local stations. I loved upgrading my ship from the inventories of captured  ships. I'm always looking for the shield or weapon improvment. I loved exploring the map and seeing all the cool spacial anomalies. UnfortunateIy, though I did find some general weaknesses in the way content is utilized in the game, there are only a handful of side mission types such as capture ship A, Destroy ship B, or Haul element C these side missions do get old pretty quickly and is a main reason why I cannot dump countless hours into the game in one sitting. Sometimes I also receive missions I have no way in hell of completing, the AI levels way faster than I do... I'll be level 4 with missions that are level 12 around the beginning area. It's ok as you can just drop the mission, but is kinda annoying all the same. Overall, I find the game to be pretty engaging when played casually, but any longer than a couple of hours and I'm ready for something else. I've been looking at Elite: Dangerous but it looks like a tremendous amount of tedious work to play, just from peoples reviews, that and it's much more expensive.To the developer: I really hope you guys haven't given up on this game now that it's considered ""Complete"" there is still a tremendous amount of possibilities with it, and I would love to see more content(More engaging space stations, etc.) Thanks a ton for creating a game that allows me to get my space sim fix when I feel the urge.

												Bad game! Horribly frustrating, has some good points, but overall its a very bad game.The main thing, the fighting - it sucks, 99% of the time you have to turn on auto shooting, because you can't find on the screen enemies, they just keep flying outside of your view all the time, and it doesnt matter if it is a destroyer and you are flying with corvette it still jumps around you like if it was a small fly.   As for different ship types, they all behave the same way, you don't feel any difference between piloting small ship or huge one, it looks almost the same and moves the same way.As for trade, colors of prices are cool, but otherwise trade is tedious and just a waste of time, especially that you start a game with a tiny ship, you could get better cash form mining, but it still is insignificant.You can get huge rewards for capturng ships and doing it is the most fun feature of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game... the storyline is also interesting, it kept me into the game for some time, until finally i had enought of other flaws and deleted it.You shouldn't go into long travels/explorations, save as often as you can because game like to punish you for no reason... you fly, fly, fly, die... just like that, no attack, no hazard, you just suddenly see your ship explode. Or you fly, fly, fly, game crash.... ;DOr if you want to use speed booster to get quickly to new area... the game crashes almost every time you use this item.During fights, you can read target info only when it is on the screen so it makes it quite problematic since as i said they always stay outside of your FOV.I should also mention that it has horrible localization, had to switch to English as in my native language it was horrible.And one last thing, the RPG elements... its a bad joke, not worth mentioning.

												I'm sorry, I've tried getting into this game, but I can't.  I've tried several times throughout the last year or so.Mainly it's two things.1)  There is no tutorial.  Its idea of a tutorial is to give up to 5-6 dialog boxes at a time of what things do.  It's a bit of overload (""MORE? Come ON!"").  It should walk you things slowly, like a proper tutorial.2)  Gamepad mapping.  It has partial support, and it seems to work... but the tutorial doesn't tell you what the buttons do.  It says ""To move up, press JOYSTICKUPXO"", to look down press ""JOYSTICKDOWNXO"".  Yeah.  What does that mean?  Doesn't tell you what the gamepad buttons do or the triggers.  If they have gamepad support, just make it work or say no.  I play from my couch so I'm not about to play using keyboard/mouse.It seemed OK, voice acting is super campy in the typical space game kind of way.  I just coudln't get to the Planet in the first few minutes of the tutorial.  Sorry guys.			"

												Really an excellent game. One of my favorite things in open world games is the ability to play it how you want to. Starpoint Gemini 2 offers quite a large range of options. you get dropped into a galaxy, and what you do from there is up to you.			"

												I purchased this game almost immediately during early access because I had been wanting to play a good space sim for quite a long time. It is a vast improvement over the previous title in the series and successfully creates a fun space sim experience with some rpg progression for your character. Initially after release the game was somewhat buggy, but the developers have ironed out the rough edges and even successfully adapted most of the user interface for gamepad control. Thus far I have spent most of my time in the sandbox mode, but I have recently begun the story playthrough. Both modes are fun to play with the story mode featuring a rather standard, but competently-executed space sim plot. Best of all is that steam workshop is available for the game and there have been many great mods that improve aspects of the gameplay as well as those that create custom content. There is a good diversity of ships and weaponry in the game, with ship types ranging from small gunships and shuttle craft up to battleship size vessels available to be purchased. You can also hire officers who confer stat bonuses and other ships piloted by mercenaries to join you. There are numerous ways to make money including a robust trading economy, asteroids to mine, spatial phenomena to explore, odd jobs to be done, transport/taxi missions, and of course bounty hunter missions.Combat is satisfying, though you certainly feel like more of a ship commander than a pilot. This is probably due to the game's third person perspective which suits the game well because most of the ships you will use are more like capital ships than fighters. To sum it up, this is one of the best single player space sim/rpg's to come out in a very long time. In some ways I enjoy this game more than Elite: Dangerous.			"

												I liked the game so far, but I play a lot. I am an avid player of sci fi games, medieval, simulation battle and strategy. I play games so much I do not have any other form of life except work and games. I do stay in shape as I work out a lot. I can practically tell you exactly how to make a good game and it will be a #1 top seller, I have even made games myself constucting whole citys and governments with plots and story lines along with political agendas on governments and war. This Starpoint Gemini is very promising and is a good game. Couple of pointers to the developers, you should have ships hunt you down as if looking for you and then take off before being destoyed. Somone you can recognize that you have seen before but make some what elusive so he/she can come back again to hunt you from a jurisdiction you are not welcomed of course, but this should be once in great while not an everytime thing. Another thing is that when you get high level in the game all you see is big hard ships all the time, almost no small ones. In the begining you would see them a lot. I am level 80 and it does not seem to be going any highier(no complaints). But sometimes you exit from a station or a star gate and you are jumped by a horde of big ships just out of the blue(c'mon a little ridiculouse at times)it happens often and half the time you dont stand a chance unless you have big hired mercenarys that are expensive to maintain, which does take a big toll on the money you make. Sometimes you fall behind unless you really try to keep up the hustle and bustle of making money, then its more stress instead of pure enjoyment to try and keep good powerfull mercenarys at youre side. You should fan it out more to where at least 50% of the time there are still smaller groups of ships, or one or two important people(hunters) that show up to hunt you like I said previously, Instaed of being mobbed by a lot of big powerfull ships all the time. There still needs to be smaller ships around of all sizes. All I see now are big ships everywhere and almost no small ones traversing through space or hanging out at space stations. Its almost as if everybodys super rich now and got dreadnaughts and carriers becouse I am level 80 now. You need to tone that down to be more normal. If you did that the game would excell in greatness, otherwise that is a major downfall. But I do see it getting bigger more powerfull ships to attack you as you are highier in level that makes sense, but overall it needs to be re-worked to how i mentioned previously, thank you...... Several hours later on re-editing, I am now back to write what I said. There is more randomness, I guess i was just to fast to express at 80th level. I went back in different parts of the galaxy, it does get heavy at times and then again light on battles just depends. Also what i like is there are also missions you can take that can be much lower than youre level and also much highier. There still needs to  be ones that hunt you down and occasionally escape to come back another time but with a name to them you can recognize. May i also add i have not played the story line yet and am looking forward to it, its just in the free roam you can choose other characters instead of bieng stuck with the same story line one. Overall its all good and was very enjoyable playing. Would be nice to have another dozen songs in the game, the music is similar to eve music which I liked a lot when I played eve back in 2009.			"

												I loved freelancer and this game has that feel to it. You can even capture ships and sale them which quickly becomes the best way to make money. However a few things that I dislike in base game (though since you can mod it heavily some things can be fixed), the way ship levels are done and strength of weapons allowed on ships bothered me as a lot of money spent for so little gained. I felt like (without mods) that upgrading my ship to a much more expensive version often didn't gain any DPS. I wound up using a lot of modding to make this flow better for me.			"

												Well so far after 14 hour i must say it a great game. what i can tell is that could be a bit more uppdates like : The Turial is all reading but could be easier if they give a short intro in a video and make you try it self (Fighting, bording and much more). It took me several hours before i really understand how to do the basic stuff like bording and easier way to lvl up with good money. This game reminds me of Galaxy on Fire 2 but its much more bigger galaxy and more hours of play time :) only thing i miss its the mining. In this game you only have to shoot the asteroids to collect the Minerals			"

												I was out of the genre for a couple of years, and still believe freelancer holds the title of king. While this games tries really hard to copy from freelancer (the ui looks like it was copied straight from 2003) the game doesn't flow.I have a modern GPU and a fast system, but the engine just doesn't seem responsive. In freelancer I felt like I nimble ship that responds to my every movement, Startpoint feels like I'm piloting a space oil tanker. Single player made unbarable by the voice acting and the incoherent script.  I still remember large parts of the freelancer plot back from over 12 years ago, here: I can't tell you what I did 5 minutes ago. I don't remember the characters name, don't care about his stupid quest, I just remember it's something really pointless and stupid.Don't buy this game. I can't think of anyone who it'll appeal to. Maybe Elite is better (didn't try), maybe no man's sky will live up, but there's absolutly no potential in this game, it's a waste of money and time.			"

												I'll go on to say that if you enjoyed Freespace 2 or similar space themed games then you will find yourself immersed in this game. I will also add that the game requires a decent PC for the optimal smooth gameplay experience. In Starpoint Gemini 2 you get to upgrade and purchase ships as well as level up your character. There is a story ark mode available and freeroam option where you can try and emulate a raider, trader, mercenary and more. Combat in this game is extremely satisfying and blowing up combatant ships nearly never gets old. Even though this game is slated as a finished product the developers are still adding in more functions to add to the replayability and longevity of the base game. Plus all those Steam Workshop mods add to the overall experience if you want to mix things up a tad. Overall I rate this game a 7.8/10.			"

												Poor mans X Universe game. Here is how you defeat every ship that attacks you: Come to a complete stop, (because the space fighting is a joke and he enemy ships will stop with you) then because the targeting system is non existent, turn on auto fire, then spin 360 degrees spamming your heavy weapons. It may be a space game but everything is on a 2D plane. this may not sound bad, but fighting in space NEEDS three dimenshions. Every single ship in the game plays the same. Bigger ones just have more hitpoints, turrets, and hangars. And they still suck. If you want a true space fighter sim, get any ""X"" game. Except ""Rebirth"" ♥♥♥♥ that game.			"

The storyline aint the grandest or most unique experience, but the gameplay and space combat is engaging and fun. The pilot skill progression and the upgrading to better ships provides a compelling reason to keep blasting away.I say, if you enjoyed freelancer, give this a crack.			"

												I wanted to like this game, but the texts everywhere are too small, hard to read, and so reading through the tutorial was a chore. The campaign was boring, but the Freeroam mode just leaves you out in the open. Quests you get are too straightforward, not even giving you a small background on why you have to put down a ship, it just appears on your starchart and you'd be free to grab it if you want. Ultimately, the voice acting is very bad, which was really off-putting. I was looking for an experience similar to Sid Meier's Pirates! and Mount and Blade: Warband, but I sadly didn't get that here.			"

												There's quite a few things to like in this space trading/shooter game. The developers have managed to infuse a fair bit of live into this one, and it does have some pretty neat game mechanics. The best way of defining it is as a crossover of Freelancer and Starfleet Command, even if I find SPG 2 to be neatly an inferior game to both. Compared with Freelancer, this title hasn't delivered for me the same degree of immersion and engagement with the storyline and the universe that I remember of playing Freelancer. Compared to the second, the tactical combat in this game to be flawed in some departments and shallower, even if there are some cool ideas in here.The stuff I like Even if we're restricted to one single system, there's indeed a lot of places to go and things to see. This is a *big* game. Trading and mining are actually viable professions, not just an side to mercenary or piratical activities. There's lots of ships, and lots of modules to fit your ships with.  Combat is engaging, and fun, at least for some time. I do like very much the ""ammo-based"" modules (scavenger drones, mining torpedoes, etc.). These modules can be swapped in flight - which might detract from a plausibility point of view, but I personally don't mind it much - and you can actually feel like having a purpose (they're quite useful actually). The game is highly moddable.The stuff that leaves me indifferent or I am not very impressed by While there's a great variety of weapons, I find that rather than having 5 varieties of the same thing with slightly tweaks to range, damage, power drain, etc. it would have made sense to have just one type and increase the ""rigging possibilities"". Per-module rigging is in  the game, but you can just add one type of rig to one specific module. You can recruit crew, but this crew is reduced to specific buffs to your ship (weapon accuracy, speed, etc.). They level out, and do provide with an extra layer of ship customization. But sometimes the bonuses are so specific that one wonders why are you paying religiously salaries on a monthly basis. There's no enemy leveling - that is, if you go to certain places you may find yourself vastly overmatched by NPC ships. Knowing when to engage and when to fly is an important skill to develop. The problem comes when these ""hero"" NPCs basically can appear anywhere and the information that allows you to assess whether or not you're outclassed is only visible if you keep it in your sights. Which can be quite difficult. The combat skills system looks good, but very much as with the crew, lacks some depth (and you also wonder why you should bother with those skills).The stuff I plainly don't like The HUD is functional, but I would have really liked that I could have waypoints (that is, locking on locations) and targets (that is, locking on ships and stations) at the same time. Currently, you either have a waypoint or a target. Even worse is that the waypoint/target data is only visible if you have your bow pointed towards the object you locked on. That makes stuff like checking on nearby hostile ships while travelling towards your destination disorienting or just plainly dangerous (since you will close onto these enemies). The world is very much structured like that of Privateer/Freelancer, but crammed into one single star system. What was plausible in those games, here feels a bit uncomfortably contrived. Even if the world is big, I didn't get that ""to boldly go where nobody has before"" kind of vibe that you get in Elite Dangerous or Evochron Mercenary, for instance. I find the main storyline to be completely uninteresting, and delivered in a very unappealing way.It's a cheap game, indeed, but since I haven't enjoyed it much, I can't really recommend it to anyone.

												It is interesting but fairly basic compared to other spaceship exploration type of games.  The combat is very fast and takes some of the nuance out of the skills.  The UI is clunky and ship movement isn't very intuitive.  Trading is simpliofied but won't really make you much money. Just doing the same 4 types of missions will net you the bulk of your income and experience.  But I would have still have left a positive review if it weren't for the frequent crashes.  These crashes aren't just the game, they often freeze up my system in a way I haven't experienced in years.In researching this problem one comes across many attempted solutions (which I tried many) from others and then dev posts that point to it being a problem with Windows 10, and that they do not and will not support this game under Windows 10.  Also read from the dev posts that ""this game is 2 years old"" so they are not focused on supporting it further.  So, buyer beware.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is easily the best space adventure game available!  Little Green Men Games did a superb job in incorporating those features that make a space exploration game enjoyable while avoiding anything that would be dull.There is a main-story quest line to keep you engaged with multiple side quests to mix things up.  Space travel feels exciting and scenic without taking years in between events (with added wormholes to speed things up a little more).  There are space pirates, some dangerous while others are targets of opportunity for some quick cash, especially if you capture their ship to sell to a nearby friendly space station.There seems to be just the right number of ship and weapon variety to not get overwhelmed while still feeling like you have a choice in weapon loadout and ship type.  There are even some that you acquire through quest lines or obtaining blueprints for exceptional weapon types, including torpedoes, plasma cannons, railguns, etc.Lots of Steam achievements, beautiful scenery, fantastic spacestation design.

												This game is more fun than I thought it would be... the plot (although kinda shallow on the side quests) is entertaining.The thing I find most enjoyable is that you can play it as a first-person space dogfighting game, or you can use the fire at will feature and just fly the ship while the computer does the shooting. Trading seems to be a waste of time at least early on up to where I'm at same for mining although its a little more lucrative.

												I Love this game. Its a space RPG but you never you leave your ship. Sure its a bit old but graphics and gameplay are great.Its not too simplistic to be considered an arcade space shooter but not a mad in depth space simulator. Its quite easy to learn how to pilot, fight, nav and trade. Along the way you got many ship upgrades and ships. However be prepared to earn the credits to buy these. The space fighting is alot of fun, however its very level dependent if you engage with an emeny above your level you die. So run away tactics are sometime needed until you own a fleet of ships. There are a few problems sometimes the space fights can just kill you in seconds. You can only save you game at stations which adds to tension but alot of time you just end up replaying the same mission or area of space because of it. The soundtrack I tured off within 4 hours of gameplay its repitive and anoying and the sound effects could be better.So gamrplay is quickly learned but sometimes the fights are too difficult.soundtrack could be better.graphics are up to standard.A fun space adventure.

(some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. "

												Decent graphics, nice music and sound effects. Combat is decent and environment is large and varied. However at the current stage the game stops being fun once you've leveled up to get your dream ship. There's no more challenge and the game becomes repetitive very quickly. Still the grind is very fun and there are many mods. In short: fun but little replayability.			"

Easy money there when you tow it to station or planet.

And i was blown away how easy the ship was to controll with the mouse. (you can choose gamepad if you want) Love the ui in the game. Anway i started free roaming and collected stuff from junk out in space and traded them at nearest planet. And i really feelt like being a pilot in space trading to earn my living, its hard to explain but this game just took me by storm instant.I know that alot of thing may change further ingame but i feelt i had to type somthing.

Early Access Review
								I find it hard to say that I recommend this game, or even that I do not.I was a huge fan of Freelancer, and I have spent years looking for something that could fill the hole that Freelancer left behind. While Starpoint Gemini 2 comes close, it's not... quite... there yet. This game is still in development (just recently in beta), so bear that in mind.All of the pieces are there - free roaming, trading, space battles - however, SG2 seems to fall flat a key area - ship movement. The starting vessel, a frigate, I believe, looks like a fish, moves like a fish, but steers like a cow. Most combat is spent circling around trying to get a bead on your enemy for about 1/2 a second before they move out of view once more. By that point, his buddy has been firing lasers up your butt. I'm a space combat noob with this game, but even Freelancer felt like it had more ""zip"" to ship movement. I had to crank the mouse sensitivity just to feel like there was some kind of response to the controls.Graphically, it's quite nice. Ships, planets, stations and space ""stuff"" is lovely to look at.The game requires some optimization. When you are in a serious furball with many other ships, I find that the game really chugs and slows down - even if you are not involved in the combat, and it's just nearby.The game is not multiplayer, and I am not clear on whether or not it is ever going to be multiplayer. That is also a major wall for a lot of people. Freelancer was great. Freelancer with friends was amazing.This is not a Freelancer replacement, though it comes close. If you're not concerned about a multiplayer experience, you're not going to find a game that delivers what this one does at this price point. However, I would wait for later in the beta cycle or even for wide release. It's not quite ready for prime time.			"

												18 hours in and so far this game is exellent. VERY similar to Freelancer for old school gamers out there. For new people think 3rd person space shooter with trading, mission, piracy or whatever. There are tons of different ships, weapons, loadouts and play styles.Graphics are excellent and it runs really well on my rig.It can be hard in places, so don't be afraid to go away, save up and buy a bigger ship. The mission level indicators can be a little bit off. Some are waaaaaay harder than you think, then others will be easy money.Still that is life in space:I don't careI'm still freeYou can't take the sky from me.			"

												My original review (while the game was still in EA) is shown at the bottom. Please note that the sections on performance are not entirely relevant now, since the game runs much better.REVIEW AFTER RELEASE:---------------------------------------------------------The game is a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large ( gunship), and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can climb the ranks and get battleships, dreadnoughts and the like, and command officers and mercs to help you out in battle, either on your own ship or as a wingman. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely and has a massive open map to explore, complete with anomalies, slipstreams, wormholes, gates, planets, stations asteroid fields, nebula etc. - all you would come to expect from such a game and more.The campaign is basic, but enjoyable. The voice-acting is absolutely atrocious though - the accents are all over the place and it is detrimental in an necessary way. You also have the option to free-roam, doing missions as they come along, trading or becoming a pirate. It has a complete reputation and trading system, allowing you to become anything you want.A lack of multiplayer hits hard, since this game would be infinitely better with it and a real shame it is not included. It also seems to have a fairly repetitive and grindy feel to it - hence the mark of 6/10. If it had multiplayer I think my score would jump to 8/10 instantly though.Jimbo Rating: 6/10REVIEW WHILE IN EA:---------------------------------------------------------It's a mix between Freelancer and X3. You can command fleets, hire wingmen, level up skills, buy massive battleships, trade, do missions. It's a lot like Darkstar One too, if we are comparing - but a lot better.The focus here is on large ship battles - and with many ships, rather than smaller dogfigthing. Your starting ship is fairly large, and some of the stuff I have seen to buy looks cool. You can even board enemy ships and take control of them, or tractor ships back to stations to sell them.It looks lovely, but does seem to suffer from some performance issues. Putting the lengthy loading screens aside, I frequently experienced 0FPS drops when entering new sectors (occurrs quite often), which is a royal pain in the ♥♥♥ - especially if it happens to be a wing of enemy fighters.It's still beta, but if they can fix the performance issues (severe slow downs, long load times, crashing) then this game will be a winner.Jimbo Rating: 6/10Note: why have I ""not recommended"" this game - even though it's good? Simple: it's nigh-on un-playable (or very frustrating) at the moment, what with the aforementioned performance issues.			"

Its not hardcore and even people who dont like space sims could love kinda arcade side of the game.GO BUY IT IF U CAN...THROW MONEY AT THE DEVELOPERS CAUSE THEY DESERVE IT.			"

												Starpoint Gemini 2 is a pretty fun Space Sim in my opinion. Trading, Capturing Ships, Fleet battles, Exploring, and just flying around and admiring the skyboxes are all a treat in this game. The graphics are good looking in many areas. The Gemini system is pretty damn big, too. On the down side, the game seems to have a hard time keeping a steady frame-rate, no matter how powerful your rig is. It's especially bad in large fleet battles. Other than that, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. At least until Star Citizen comes out.			"

The Gemini system is pretty damn big, too. On the down side, the game seems to have a hard time keeping a steady frame-rate, no matter how powerful your rig is. It's especially bad in large fleet battles. Other than that, I'd say it's definitely worth checking out. At least until Star Citizen comes out.			"

												Up front:  Not deep enough or fun enough to warrant a $35 entry fee.  Definitely worth it for $10.Pros:+Artwork.  Ships and backdrops are pleasant enough to look at and cruising through space in your ride of choice is nice.+Simple, easy to use interface and controls.  Love the interface.+Straightforward missions+Stable and nicely refined.  Have yet to run in to a ""broken quest"" or a significant bug of any kind.+Decent enough sized sandbox system to play in.  It takes 15 minutes to fly across Gemini even with the fastest ship. +Game adjusts difficulty rather well as you progress to bigger ships.+Soundtrack is a definite plus that matches the mood of the task at hand.+Lots of factions.  No, they don't really fight all that differently but...they are labeled differently.+Faction loyalty.  It is simple to see who you are friends with and who you should avoid.  System is easy and intuitive.+Decent variety of ships, loots and weapons keeps things interesting.+Fighters and bombers can be launched from you ship.+Perk system.  As you gain rank you can shape your fighting style and abilities.  Easy and effective without being OP.+Steam workshop enabled.  I find looking at the hind end of an Intrepid Class is nicer than the stock ships.Cons:-Game progression can be very grindy at times.-Uncompelling campaign became unbearable because of horrid voice acting.  I began playing free-roam instead.-Ships all fly and feel the same.  A battleship handles just as well as a frigate, it just has more weapons, shields etc. :(-Unable to target specific enemy ship systems.-Sensor range is pitifully low.  You'll always see things before your sensors do.-Combat feels shallow a good portion of the time.  Tactics rarely decide outcome, usually ship stats are it.-Combat AI is downright stupid at times. As a level 18 I destroyed a level 70 pirate because they kept chasing me.  My one pea-shooter gun could hit them from 800 out, their guns could only reach 550.  As they chased me I eventually wore down their forward shield and nearly destroyed them before they turned and ran.  At that point I ran them down, overtook and finished by shooting through their non-existent forward shield.-Controls are simple, but can be awkward at times.  No target padlock option. (Really?)-3rd person views only.  You will never be ""in your ship""and that hurts immersion.-No sense of running a crew.  Your ""crewmen"" are cards with stats that don't progress.-Game does not track ships destroyed, troops lost, total money accrued etc.  Nice touches that are easy to make.-Small variety in mission types.  Scan something, shoot something, ferry something.  That's pretty much it.-No ability to build up a true fleet, can just hire a couple mercs.-No feel of actually influencing events in the game world.-When you dock at a station or planet, all interactions are handled through a simple splash screen.Summary:Starpoint Gemini 2 is a nice little space romp for casual/arcade crowds.  I would personally prefer options available to transform this basic game experience into something a little more hardcore.  Replayability is hurt by lack of simulation options, inability to shape conflict and shallow combat mechanics.  Less than 20 hours in I have a dreadnought class warship, have maxed out alliances with half the factions and explored roughly 60% of the systems in the game.  I do not feel as though I will make any substantial new discoveries at this point, just find combinations of things already previously seen.  The game has begun to feel like a ""digital fishbowl"" but may come back if I find myself in the mood for mindless point and click with a spaceship involved.  Score: 7.5			"

												Yes get this game, wait do you need to hear the dialog and be given direction? Okay less one sided. But if those are both no then hell yes get this game.Where to start, I got this game on sale, and wanted to refund it. However I gave it one more try and managed to get through the first little bit, and all of a sudden I loved it like crazy...Side notes I guessI really like the ship details and variety, although I wish there were more. (I always want more ships)The story line got kind of lame and or broken near the end.The main dialog is painful. Punishment for warcrimes painful...So if you are going to give it a go -Turn off the dialog! ----Do IT! (the music is nice though, and in freeroam the dialog is much less death)-And get ready to be spammed like crazy by ""helpful"" tutorial pop ups as soon as you start. (some are very helpful)----You can skip them or dissable them at your discretion though so not a big deal.-You can zoom out with the numpad +/- keys-You need to restore default keybinds when you start, or the delete key doesn't bring up your tactical view (which once up is handy)I think those are the main things that coloured my lack of enjoyment with it at first, so knowing that you should have a much better run of it. Oh I found the gunner class was less entertaining than the other two classes, even if you are mostly planning on shooting everythingBut seriously I have had a heck of a lot of fun with this game, and will likely continue to do so for a good bit more. I haven't tried all the ships yet and there are still some achievements to go. "

												I Love this game. Its a space RPG but you never you leave your ship. Sure its a bit old but graphics and gameplay are great.Its not too simplistic to be considered an arcade space shooter but not a mad in depth space simulator. Its quite easy to learn how to pilot, fight, nav and trade. Along the way you got many ship upgrades and ships. However be prepared to earn the credits to buy these. The space fighting is alot of fun, however its very level dependent if you engage with an emeny above your level you die. So run away tactics are sometime needed until you own a fleet of ships. There are a few problems sometimes the space fights can just kill you in seconds. You can only save you game at stations which adds to tension but alot of time you just end up replaying the same mission or area of space because of it. The soundtrack I tured off within 4 hours of gameplay its repitive and anoying and the sound effects could be better.So gamrplay is quickly learned but sometimes the fights are too difficult.soundtrack could be better.graphics are up to standard.A fun space adventure.

												I went into this game as a buffer between waiting on a few other games im looking forward to.  Keeping that in mind I do love all scifi/space games in general.  The beginning was difficult i was having a hard time learning the controls and ended up giving up within the first two hours.  I gave it another try and got the basics down and now am 36 hours into the game.  I found myself loving it and enjoying the mystery of the story.  From what i expect from a 30 usd game it surpasses in all categories.  Yeah tutorials are not great,  the voice overs are off sometimes  and not perfect, finding the help section or explainations in the game about buying selling or how to bounty hunt and null and void.  But with all that it is a 30 buck game reg price and i bought it for under 10 bucks.  I rather enjoy figuring out how to figure out all the aspects of making money in game.  I say 2 thumbs up for what it is and i enjoy it even though i dislike 3rd person or control the ship games where im not in a first person view.  36 hours into it im not even in the dlc yet and havent even explored all the space available in the game aswell.  I say its a win win!!!!			"

												7/10I really enjoy open ended space sim games. This one is a very happy medium between easy to learn and fun to play.It does not have the vast options and customization as games like EVE or X, but I would trade that for a more fun and easy to play game.Like:-Open world with a variety of play styles.-Good selection of ships and equipment loadouts.-Looks great, cool ship and station designs. fairly immersive-Easy to learn controls and interfaces, even decent camera control.-Combat is fun and sometimes intense.Really enjoyed:-Capturing ships.-Trading (Easy to use ""best buy/sell"" interface!)-Exploring, pirate hunting-Completing full loadouts on a ship feels very accomplishing.Dislike:-Map feels small and underwhelming.-Copy pasted missions (gets old in any game though.)-Story started out pretty lame (avenge my father! collect stuf!) but i didnt get far into it. voice acting was passable..-Random impossible difficulty battleships showing up out of nowhere, or even in a mission.-I feel like some stats are missing, or hard to manage when making a loadout. Such as:Weapon energy consumption vs regen. And how to buff regen / lower consumption?Turret arc max angles. Fix: List this on ship stats, or a visual on the loadout page would be awesome.A better display of your ships stats (the circular display looks very awesome, but is not practical when zoomed out.)Is there a display for your own crew size? I may have missed it, from my reason above.Recommended for any type of space sim fan, but definitely leaning towards casual.			"

Early Access Review
								There's a lot to like about this game, equally it still has room for improvement, but overall I'd recommend it in its current state for the price. If you've ever played EVE, you will immediately see the attraction of an ""offline mode"" style game, that you can pause when the pizza guy comes or save before doing something stupid.Things I really like.* The universe is already pretty big, lots of places to explore but the game has features like wormholes, JumpGate networks and TeleportDrives to get you around faster than full speed ahead into one direction.* Ships look cool, there is a good variety of designs and varied configurations already, Its obvious there will be more to come.* Great maneuverability of the ship, it's the type of piloting I really wished EVE had, you can really out maneuver a lot damage if you get good at it allowing you to take out larger ships that claim to be ""impossible"".* Shielded sides, you don't fly around in a ""bubble"" shield like most games, each side of your ship has emitters and if one side is busted you're taking hull damage! That really fits my play style of focused attack. I hope that later one you can divert power to bolster one side or the other depending on where you are taking the most damage.* You can board other ships with what amounts to raiding parties and fight their crew, if you manage to take them down, you can grapple their ship and tow it (painfully slowly) back to a station and sell it or use it as your own. This will be a good source of income if it didn't take ages to get a ship back to station. I'd suggest adding a towtruck style ship that we can come back with or something and get it there much faster, just let us bookmark the spot and return would be fine.Areas in need of improvement* I guess its the pilot's radar, but its way too small to be useful and you can't zoom-in, you can tell if there are enemies in the area the same as if there are friendlies, but it's hard to gauge you're position or distance from them without ""looking out your window"" by turning your ship or the camera. I'd prefer more thought into that, it needs to be bigger and zoom able and a lot more detailed about what each tiny blimp is. For example, you can drop a ZETH which is basicly an automated sentry fixed in space, but if you fly too far from it you may never find it again and its not cheap. I frequently lose mine if there are NPC friendlys around because it's impossible to tell what anything is.* Stations need to be able to attack, I love the warnings that tell me any enemy station is nearby, so the first time I heard that I saved the game and flew right at one, but nothing happened, I think they should start firing some lasers if enemy craft turn up.*Needs more ship system customization and I think this is already on the way based on some of the anomaly scans I've done, cause you need jamming, ECM, shield boosters, etc. The ability to vary your ship should be based on more than just what skills you're pilot has, not to keep bringing up EVE but there's a lot to take for example there.

												At first I found this game a bit frustrating. I ran out of money by unmounting and remounting my turrets as I didn't realise it cost money to do so. Then when I reloaded the main quest bugged and I couldn't fly to the place the quest was supposed to take place in. A simple restart of the game fixed this and I've been hooked ever since. There are still some minor bugs to be ironed out but none of them really affect the game play. The game looks gorgeous on high settings and the mechanics are well done, the combat is great as well-it starts with a lot of one-on-one but later on the fights get very chaotic and fun. The voice acting isn't exactly stellar but it has a decent story in campaign mode. If you were a fan of Freelancer, the X series, space sims in general get this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I have constantly shunned the games that say ""We are currently building our Beta version... blah blah blah."" As these game companies often move into the vapor ware that we all so hate.  Knowing that; and knowing that I have been seeking a great 4x game, (I just KNEW that one was out there somewhere), I purchased this game in the Beta 0.8 state.Now one might expect a lot of bugs and CTD from a large scale game like this.  With the small additions coming evey couple weeks I would expect the same.That all being said: 8/10 in its current form.I find this game amazing for a number of reasons.  The 4x aspect of this game is in place and you are allowed to pick ""free fly"" mode and just enjoy.  Fully armed pirates will come try to kill you, and you have to defend ships that ask for help if you are in the region.  The speed of some space sim games have put me off, you know, the three minutes slowly flying to the jump gate or what not.  Well SG2 gives you the ability to max out your engines with the push of one button and cruise wherever you want QUICKLY.  The speed of gaining levels is really great, you feel like you are doing something after you start killing pirates.  Getting an immediate advantage, then leveraging that advantage to kill more raiders and bandits.  You level up quickly because the max level seems to be above 70.  With several hours in I have reached level 15 and have an amazing 2.8M credit ship.  So you can play for a short period and feel great about the results.  But please note, this easy mode still allows for the chance that bandits get fed up and come to kill you.  I have been ambushed 3x and killed them only once... died in a burst of flame the other two times.  Love it, cannot wait for the story line.			"

												This is (in my opinion) one of the greater games on Steam. For those who are looking for a TASTE of EVE here you go. This game is almost like a baby stepping stone into the EVE universe. While the game does have its flaws as I will state, I believe that this sandbox game has great potental. Now, I will say that I do not believe it is worth $40 just yet. The modding community has yet to take off and you can cheat the game by simply opening your save in Notepad++ and editing the data. Which I believe somewhat cuts the fun out of comparing achievements to other players globally. The missions of hunting the heros are somewhat wonky as well because it seems they jump systems if you watch the map. Just as well, there is a very large difficulty spike in the game that you must prepare for. As you reach a certain level your enemies gain vet rank and you probably have yet to make enough money to even afford a ship that can stand up to them. (Unless you did what I do and stole a ship from the pirates) Now for the positives. This game has BEAUTIFUL scenery. For an indie game, a lot of time was put into this game and its atmosphere. The story and voice acting are a bit stale, but the fact that they are there is awesome. And the story, while being a bit dry, actually does make some form of sense. So kudos! At the start of the game you may pick to be a captain, engineer or another class that excels in firing. You may hire mercenaries to board ships or even follow you in to battle which is what the captains perks stand for. The shooter class perks somwhat speaks for itself. But I played as an engineer as the perks seemed to outweigh the others. The story is the same regardless of your class, but each class has its own specialties with 4 main ""moves"" But those moves have 5 evolutions within each allowing you to alter them as you go to tailor your playstyle up to the max level of 80. There are a plethora of planets to explore as well as tons of ships to purchase and try out. All in all, if you enjoy sandbox style games and as well as enjoy the beauty of flight or space travel, I recommend this game. I also recommend trying it if your thinking about EVE online. This game is a MUCH simpler thing. But it has many of the same aspects as well as can help you decide if you would even enjoy the simple aspects of what EVE offers before you worry about the more complex matters.			"

												Very slow to start; the controls could be explained better.   Crashed into Trinity about 5 times when I was supposed to ""LAND ON PLANET""  wasnt until I asked on Forums that ""Land""= ""Anchor"".   Scanning of ship wasnt vry helpful either until I accidently hit the Middle mouse button (which I seldom ever used before)Travel is slow, have to have lots of patience, although I think with upgraded ships & a better knowledge of the travel short-cuts (t gates, rifts, blackholes) it could be faster.

												I'd recommend this game, but it still has a few bugs to work out. So far I had a graphic anomoly where almost evr=erything went black and apparently invulderable so. Then a lock up towards the end of the mission ""Empire's End"", and that was a tough fight to get stuck on. Frustrating. But it's a good game. Since it's just got out of beta, the devs are still working on ironing out the kinks.			"

												Game's damn fun...worth the cash...But how about a salvage beam or dedicated droids that are not one time use ? Shooting at derilicts is fun but a little ""realism"" could definitely contribute to more immersion. Still...I'm having a blast. Mining is actually FUN you have to aim at the 'roids and they give you a very satisfying blast. Being an EVE player where mining was a sleepathon, I can actually enjoy it now.			"

												Probably the most fun I've had in a space game since Star Trek Online.  Huge sandbox to play in. It's a very polished game in a lot of respects; graphically it's stunning. At the moment it's going through a bug fix phase since it was just released to the general public, some skills branches don't work (at least for engineer that I picked), and there's a lot unexplained mechanics, this will no doubt be resolved. I expect this game will only get better with time.			"
