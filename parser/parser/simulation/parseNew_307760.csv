												Zoo Park is a basic and simple zoo tycoon game. You'll manage your zoo, making animal pens, placing food and beverage stands, along with researching new animals and researching other things like their welfare, mating and rehabilitation. The game has an easy and quick tutorial all within the game along with challenges that will give you things to do in order to drive the game forward. You won't have control over things like ticket prices, food prices or anything like that. Your goal is just to keep adding to the zoo. The menus are very easy to use and the game's controls are almost exclusively mouse driven.This is an easy game, its grid based in an isometric fashion. You can't rotate your perspective. You'll select to build a type of fence, click and drag a square pen to put the animals in. Then you'll buy plants, place water pools and food before you add the animals.To unlock animals, you need to build a region research center (there are a few regions), and research the animal. After a specific amount of time on a progress bar, they unlock. Then you have the option to keep researching the specific species welfare, breeding and rehabilitation. Each takes time and each can be done three times per species. The breeding means they'll breed faster when in perfect conditions. Animals will have a progress bar. The rehabilitate lets you send them back into the wild. I don't really see a purpose for it. The welfare means the animal will get sick less and wow do these animals get sick. The game has a ticker at the bottom that feeds you all activity in the park, who has a baby, what you just bought, and when an animal gets sick. It then tells you to keep your habitat clean. Even if the habitat has the perfect amount of foliage, water, is 100% clean and your animals are well fed, they still get sick. Then you need to click on the animal and click on the cure icon. Poof they're cured for a price. The whole research center system feels hollow since you don't have to have a path attached or even staff it, but you don't have to staff any buildings.You have zoo keepers that will feed animals and clean pens. The amount of zoo keepers is capped by how many employee buildings you have built. When you click on an empty space in an animal pen, you can assign what percentage the food levels need to fall before they feed your animals and the same for cleaning the pens. Personally, I keep my levels high to prevent animal illness. The animals being rehabilitated need their own personal zoo keeper. There are only keepers and not vets, gardeners, and janitors. Gardeners would have been nice, since the plants in your game die after 20 or so days, forcing you to remove the dead plant, then add a new one to replace it. That just seems like an extra step, an extra chore in the game. That's not the only chore, your animals will age and die quite rapidly, forcing you to replace them. You can see an animal go from a newborn to an animal that dies of old age in the span of two weeks.The game consists of days, there's a start of the day before the gate opens, then the actual time when the zoo is opened and an after hours period. While this is an interesting twist to things, nothing really happens when your zoo is closed. It is more of a prep time to add things and assign a marketing campaign, which is sadly a daily task you need to click open the advertising section and select the campaign. It should just be set without forcing you to do it every day and if you forget to do it, that's just lost income for your zoo.I say income, well the game's currency is 'popularity points' and not cash or money. You accumulate popularity points each day, but you won't actually get them to spend until the day ends. I guess that it makes sense, no one would have money until the registers are cleaned out. That causes a problem that you can run out of funds quickly and your animals will starve all day when there's no money to buy their food. That won't kill them, but that will make them sick eventually. If enough animals die, that's a game over. There are four difficulties, but it was very difficult to fail on normal difficulty (there is an easy difficulty).Not only do the animals have needs, but the people do too. For food, drink and toilet. So you need to place all of those things. Not just that, but they want to see beautiful decorations. You'll need to buy them and tactically place them. Each decoration has a radius and a beauty percentage. Exhibits will also need walkways around them, so they can be better seen. It adds some strategy to the game, but there's no sort of bonus for having all African animals in a section of the zoo instead of African in one pen, American in another and Asian right next to it. At the end of each day, you'll get a recap of what's needed, whether its more food or more decorations. You'll also see a summary of your animal health and their needs.There is only one zoo. There are no scenarios to play, no different zoos. Just an empty plot of land that you start with and quickly build your own zoo. You can easily expand your sanctuary, just by buying more land. Its as easy as that.The controls feel very click heavy. There are no hot keys, not even a menu, you'll need to push a menu button to get it. At least the menus get broken up into regions that act like filters. You'll click animal, African animal, then click the animal. You won't scroll up or down like normal games, you'll need to click a 'next' sort of button. To pan the screen, you'll need to right click and drag the screen. Its not awful, but it does make the game feel awkward, like a mobile game.What I really enjoy about the game is its challenges and rewards. Not only is there a list of ongoing challenges that will unlock things or give you random animals or a random baby, but there are day long challenges. These day long challenges amount to, we have an animal for you and if you want the animal, you need to get your zoo ready by doing 4 things, preparing for the animal, building the pen, putting out food, adding plants and so on. If you complete the goal, you get the animal and that animal species becomes unlocked without being researched. This is a nice touch that gives a free play sort of game a goal to achieve.  That's the problem without scenarios. There's no end game. You'll just keep going. That might be awesome to some, but I really get bored of looking at my one zoo for 5+ hours with nothing changing.In all, it just feels like a really dull game. Being broke for an entire day and waiting to get a heap of a money at the end of the day didn't help. The ticker at the bottom is a big help to let you know what's going on. There are super easy menus and easy to set up a functioning zoo in no time, but there are elements that feel like chores. Replacing animals, clicking to cure animals, removing and replacing trees. Small zoos are fine, but large zoos, it becomes an issue.			"

												Zoo Park is a great simple minded, simply presented zoo management ""simulator"". Although it might not be as inclusive as Zoo Tycoon or Wildlife Park, it's down to earth and easy to use controls and ideas are so easily and readily grasped no matter your age. Sure it might not be an actual simulator, but I have found myself losing track of time when playing. Gameplay wise, it is very much similar to any other zoo simulator: start with nothing but money (or points in this case) and build your way up. There is no rating system or critics critiquing your zoo, but there are challenges to be done. This game is more of an arcade style of simulator. Focusing on fast point and click fun rather than the slow climb to prestige that is only achieved through thorough understanding of the game. You start with a couple animals and you must research others to unlock them for placement in your own zoo (referred to as a sanctuary in-game). Although not really ""realistic"", I have found myself always wanting to research one more animal and place him in the zoo before saving and quiting. Taking care of your animals is also quite simple. You can open up the animals menu and see the space, food, water, vegetation, and fence requirements of the animal. Simple satisfy all the needs to have the ""perfect"" habitat and your animals will start breeding. You can also research other things besides animal usage, such as research to lessen the amount of time your animal gets sick or quicken the breeding time. As for the visitors of the zoo, they also need several things satisfied to ensure you get the most points per day (12 hours of in-game time, using the fast forward option, it would probably be around 5-10 minutes of real time). They are how well they can see the animals, how many they see, attractions/features, drinks, food, and gifts. There aren't many concessions types so you end up with a zoo littered with the same hamburger or hotdog stands which is boring, but hopefully there will be updates with more.Overall I really enjoyed the game. The pricing for me is probably a little over (maybe worth $10 max), so if you are on the fence, buy this on a discount like I did (only $3!). However, if you like the simplistic idea and just enjoy animals, zoo sims. and playing a casual, relaxing game, I would say this game does a pretty good job of satisfying some of those simplistic urges. Notice how I used simple/simplistic so many times. If you want a hardcore, ultra zoo simulator GOTY deluxe edition 2020, this is NOT for you.			"

												It is an unique way to play a zoo tycoon like game but isn't for everyone. Instead of money, you earn popularity points to spend on upgrading the park. All of the animals besides the beginning one must be earned through research.  Barebones, it is a zoo park--no multiple scenarios and limited amount of challenges to achieve.  If you are looking for wonderful graphics, look else where. But it does have its own bit of charm, if you ignore the slightly annoying two-thirds angle. It feels more like it was designed to be a mobile game that was changed half-way through the production process. The big problems I have with it is my animals get sick soo easily, even if their habitats are clean. And the breeding program is annoying at best, with the first animals you buy will most likely never actually have any children before they become too old to do so. It has enough interest to keep me going for awhile, creating multiple parks. And for its price, it works. However, it wouldn't have been worth it if it was more expensive.			"

												A simple, but very addictive zoo sim. I used to play Zoo Tycoon a lot when I was little, this game has a feel very reminiscent to that game. Though the graphics are better than the original Zoo Tycoon game, it does have less animals to choose from. I wish there were more challenges, but the ones you have can be pretty challenging. I do love the selection of animals that are available, and the fact that the animals make real accurate sounds when you click on them. I also love the realistic artwork of the animals on their status pages and that there is a different picture for Male, Female, and baby animals of each species. I appreciate the ability to fast forward time in the game. I also appreciate that it is very easy to navigate and learn the mechanics of the game, and it is a very easy game to just play for a few minutes here or there. I wish there were a bit more variation in the decorations/features included in the game, but I do enjoy what there is already available. The game is very relaxing and stress relieving to play, and the music is cheerful and appropriate for the game. Overall, this game is well worth trying out, especially if you are a fan of casual sim games and animals.			"

												Enjoyable game...HOWEVERMiss this genre but was dissapointed when I got to day 15-20 (couldnt get past 20 from all the bugs). At day 15, program began to crash every once in a while. Soon after, it crashed after only a few actions. No longer playable. Would have still recommended if it was cheaper but with all the bugs its still disappointing for the price tag. hopefully will be fixedIn addition, no option to reduce resources once your park gets really large. I have about 160 animals and 500 visitors and it takes way too  long to get through one day at the ""faster speeds"" (which end up being slower because of all the lagEDIT:Decided to recommend this game for the lack of good 2D simulators out there. Really if you want to play past a certain size you are going to have to save after every major action. Luckily, the game loads extremely quickly so its not a big deal.  Recommended for casual play.

												I got this gamea few months ago, and although i have not spent that long on it, i felt i should write a review to try and counteract all the negative reviews this game has gotten.The first thing i want to say is no, this is NOT zoo tycoon. if its a zoo tycoon type game you are looking for, go buy and/or play zoo tycoon. This game is more an animal sancturay game than a zoo game. This means that you have to work harder to get to a good point in the game. not all the animals are available from the start, many you have to research. if you want to breed them faster, you have to research that, along with improved health, and if you wish to rehabilitate animals, and release them to the wild, you can again do this faster via research.There are not as many animal as in zoo tycoon, but there are still enough to keep you happy, and your sanctuary full. The exhibits you make for the animals are simpler than in zoo tycoon, which may make this game more youngster friendly, in that you simply choose the habitiat, how big you want the exhibit, and then place some trees, all of which are listed under the same habitats as the animals they are designed for. for example, if you want a lion, place an african exhibit, the some african trees. job done!  you can also place pools of water and rocks for animals which require them.It is much easier on this game to earn 'money' to buy new items, or spend on new animals or research, again making it a bit more friendly for younger players.there are some cons, in that alot of the animals do not live long enough to breed unless you have fully researched their faster breeding to 3 stars, so when they die you will have to pay out to replace them, but with the ease of money making in this game its not a huge problem.At the price its currently at, £4, i would highly recommend this game, its a fun, animal themed passtime, that is well worth the money!I hope i have conviced at least one person to try this game, overlooking all the 'this is not zoo tycoon' reviews.

												Not a bad game at all, especally for the price.  Only minor annoyance is animals get sick without warnning half the time as you fast forward.  And then finding all the animals and trying to click on them is difficult with all the plants they require to have.  Add an option to hide the plants and notifiy every time one gets sick and it's a good game to pass the time.			"

												Zoo Park feels like the kind of game you would normally find on facebook. You create and build a park, research different things about animals from different regions, make the animals feel comfortable and happy by placing appropriate flora and fauna in their habitat and so on. The game is pretty simple, doesn't take a whole lot to get the hang of and has a playable tutorial that walks you through step by step how to get started.Visually, Zoo park feels and looks like something you would normally play on facebook. That doesn't make it a bad game, just really, really simple and made so that anyone big or small could play it. All in all it was kinda fun, I enjoyed setting up a habitat with African Buffalo, but wish there were a little more detail, such as information related to the animals you place, so you can learn a little while playing and having fun. Even without this, it's not a bad game.			"

												Let me start by lowering your expectations. If you have played Zoo Tycoon 1 or 2 then you will be dissapionted with this game. Zoo Tycoon 2 is obviously much higher end in terms of graphics and overall gaming satisfaction but if you are a lover of simulation games related to zoos and managment then this is not a bad game to add to your collection. If I was a gamer that wasn't familar with either of the Zoo Tycoon games then this game would probably be a bit more fun because I wouldn't know any better. Not to dumb the game down, it is actually pretty complicated in some ways. Fun game for 5 bucks but don't expect too much. I really hope the Zoo Tycoon series eventually makes its way over to Steam one day.			"

												I though it just like Zoo Tycoon, atleast the first one, but no. It have limited gameplay and limited animel. If you want unlock animals, you have to wait like 10 minutes each. There are no money in this game, but instead a currency called reputation which have few or none of management value. > If you like a simple animal park management that only focus on animal building this is for you. This game felt just like playing an old Facebook zoo games. Yeah you know which one..> But If you like me, who want to play advanced zoo that have 'this' feel that you're actually run your own zoo while edutace yourself about animals, then buy another game like Wildlife Park or better yet, the good ol' Zoo Tycoon.Get my self a refund luckily. I think I might prefer Widlife Park but its too pricey.			"

												Let me start by saying, that I've barely scratched the surface of this game. I'm 20 minutes in and only have 2 animals in my park, both of the same species.This is NOT Zoo Tycoon, which is what I came in wanting, and expecting.This is NOT a budget version of Zoo Tycoon.This isn't even Wildlife Park, this is pretty much it's own game.Research plays a large role in the game- starting out, you're only going to have a base exhibit. You can't blow everything at the start and expect to make profits, you have to play it smartly, tactically. I know that sounds odd- you usually expect to blow everything on about 5 exhibits at the start, spend a lot of money on buildings and make your Zoo look nice. In this, you start with money, an exhibit, and some buildings. Good luck, have fun.			"

												Zoo Park in theory should be a good game, however- it is not. I am an avid Zoo Tycoon fan, having wasted days of my life playing it. I only payed 69p for Zoo Park after finding it on sale on another website- I feel I have wasted 69p and I don't know how people who paid £6.99 for it will feel! I've played it for 30 minutes and I am already bored. I will be deleting it from my desktop and will never play it again. It's boring, very limited in the design aspect, graphics aren't great, it's really difficult and awkward to navigate- I just don't like it at all. Would not recommend to Zoo Tycoon fans, would however recommend to young children as the game feels more aimed towards them.			"

												Feel like Rollercoaster Tycoon has lost all of your interest? Cities Skylines not cutting your cake? Try out this hidden gem in the rough!Okay, so this game is in no means perfect. But one thing for certain, this game is a freakin' boatload of fun. I have enjoyed just sitting there for hours just watching my animals mate and building them their dream habitats. Make your visitors feel welcome to your new and improved dream park! Build many attractive features such as; statues of the many habitats that your visitors may encounter; stores for your visitors to spend their money on and much, much more!Make your animals feel at home and give them their dreams. Make them as happy as you possibly, humanly can. Allow them to breed and make your park more money. This game is amazingly fun, even if just playing for a good 10 minutes.			"

												Very much like the old 'zoo tycoon' game. A little bit more dumbed down, however; it has a simple charm. So far I'm only dissapointed by the customization. The options for customizing your zoo are limited (beyond simple diversity of creatures). I liked the aspect of zoo tycoon where you could make whole water gardens and really get creative. This game doesn't allow enough features (so far) for that to be a thing. Still, it's entertaining, and if you liked the origional zoo tycoon the controls will be quite similar. It would be very nice for children, provided they're at least at reading age. I'd wait for it to go on sale before buying.			"

												The game suffers from bad UI, and the only reason you should get it is if you desperately need a zoo game. I thought it would be more like Zoo Tycoon, but it's not. The game just feel empty. It also has a pretty bland look and not really any memorable sounds.			"

												Very nice little casual simulator, not a whole lot of super micromanagement, but just enough to give you something to do. Has a huge amount of research stuff, doing the animals and ""upgrading"" the animals is pretty satisfying. I like the fact that although the amount of areas isn't super huge, what you think may be short work is soon realized to take a very long time (gamewise) to unlock everything, lending to some very long term work. It may be a tad more simplistic than some bigger animal or zoo simulators, but I think that works out well, as this one can be a lot more casual while still leaving you ""lots of work"" to look foward to = a pretty good amount of playtime. Some might would call it boring but as a sim-game player I think it fits in nicely on the scale. Highly reccomend this one for casual but long term play. Since it can be ran in windowed mode, it can run while you do other things without TOO much worry about everything dying or going belly up. It's a well nice little game and doesn't deserve the mixed rating IMO.			"

												this game was on sale very cheap and it shows it in the graphics and lack of tutorial on how to use controls all it does is help you through a few things like your first sanctuaryfun if you have nothing else to do...would never have paid the full price for it that is for sure zoo tycoon has a much better atmosphere and movement for your zoo mapsthis one you have to figure out that you hold down mouse key to move about your mapso far i could not find a way to rotate the maps it is for the reasons as stated above i do not recommend paying full price it is not worth over 4 bucks but that is my opinioni hope those who have bought it love it alot because i don't...i like it ok but nothing about it makes me really want to play itcontinuously it doe not have that grab me play me feel to it like journal had. that is about it for me have a great one and Happy Gaming :)p.s. reading this over i hope it makes sense...it is how my poor brain works :D			"

												I'm 12 hours into the game and my zoo is large, but does not yet have all the animals or continents. The game has begun glitching really badly and crashes frequently. I'm not sure if this is due to the size of my zoo (some of the enclosures allow space for 5 or more large animals) or if my save file somehow got corrupted. I'm a bit disappointed since my goal was to have a totally complete zoo. We'll see if approaching the game a little differently next time will help avoid this issue.Either way, its a very fun, but imperfect, game. I don't regret the purchase, but if you're not ok with paying for a game that is likely to become pretty darn glitchy/ almost unplayable I'd pass on this one.			"

												I've just  been playing this game for over 2 hours straight, getting into it and actually really enjoying it.Not sure why you can't use arrow keys or WASD to move the screen, especially when it doesn't have edge scrolling. Instead you have to hold the right mouse button down to move, and on a macbook it's rather annoying.Word of advice, DO NOT HIT THE ESC KEY. If you click on Staff in the menu and click add staff, at the confirmation dialog, hitting ESC will hide the staff window but not exit out of the confirmation dialog. You'll get a memory address error if you press the X on that screen. Scared the life out of me when I saw it as usually that's a sign the game has crashed. Luckily I was wrong. Panic over.Now I've decided to rename a habitat and forgot what animals I had in there, so I hit ESC again thinking it would do the logical thing it should do, but no instead it closes the habitat's info screen behind the dialog, only this time... there is only one button and now it doesn't work.There's literally no way to close this rename dialog window, and I fear the game doesn't autosave! I'm still on that screen as I type, so here goes nothing. Force quit, relaunched, and luckily it does autosave! Quite a recent save too (the last time the park closed).So while I would highly recommend it for the fact it's a relaxing game to play that isn't challenging, the few issues I've mentioned are definitely annoying which makes it feel like a poor mobile port of the game.I've seen the development team have no interest in doing any more work on this game, but it's apparent that they definitely need to spend more time refining most of their games before moving onto the next.

												Zoo Park Review - Raymond KTSummary: From the towering giraffe to loveable meerkats, in Zoo Park: Run Your Own Animal Sanctuary you'll care for over 30 animals from all four corners of the Earth including lion, gorilla, coyote, puma, moose, raccoon, wolverine, snow leopard and the black bear.Good news for fans of Zoo Tycoon: you can save your money! Zoo Park doesn't even come close to Microsoft's zoo-simulations. There is little diversity in the kinds of animals and they justly seem bored, because the park can hardly be dressed up. But, there are trees, and when trees are the most important part of a zoo-simulation, enough's been said.Zoo Park presents a unique way to play a tycoon game, however, it isn't for everyone. It feels like a port from a mobile game or a Facebook game. However don't let that keep you from playing this game because it has a lot to offer. It is very creative and allows you to experiment with different park designs. It doesn't grab your hand and lead you through the gameplay like many other games, truly giving you a sense of freedom for you to explore the many aspects and elements of the game.That said if you are looking for graphical quality, you will not find it here. If you are looking for unlimited game play possibilities/replay-ability you will have to be very bored or with an empty wallet to find it here; because it is there, it's just not very fun after several playthroughs.That said, this game offers a fun experience that you will enjoy for several hours, and for the price it makes it a worthwhile buy if you enjoy tycoon/simulation games "

												Fun game but very easy and quick to get everything. Needs more attractions and decorations and also more animals. The space in which you can build your zoo is amazing but the lack of animals, items etc almost make it pointless. I really enjoyed playing it and would love for it to have been more interactive. I don't know whether it was just me but my animals were getting sick alot and the cages and as the food and the cleanliness of the cages were depleting it seemed the workers were not doing anything (yes i set the stats up to about 90% for both and had more than enough workers). So all in all a great little game that passes the time :)			"

												Quite interesting zoo simulation management games.... even there is not many to explore with when you gets into certain levels.			"

												Needlessly complicated in a world where games like Sim City and Zoo Tycoon make the interface easier to navigate, and more fun to endure.  However... there are elephants!			"

												Zoo Park is very good game, but not excellent. Whole game is about building Zoo. Graphic isn't very well, but it isn't awful, That's not graphic what is important in that type of Games, it's gameplay.Gameplay is good, we have to build some kind of fence and buy animals. Every animal requires some kind of fence. To buy animal you have to research it first, it's a long process, so that's why in game is option ""Fast Rewind"" (This is good, but also bad). You can research animals in research buildings, there are few buildings and each one of them is responsible for animals from different country (Africa, Asia etc.) You have also feed animals and keep their ""home"" clean, otherwise they start being sick, and your responsibility is to cure them which costs, if u not, it's game over.You have to care about entertainment, that's why u need to build cafe or souvenirs shop.Ups:- animals- researching- need to care about animals- some kinds of economy- rewardsDowns:- In fast rewind, game is lagging- This guy who tells you what u doing wrong is annoying, and he shows up so many times u even don't have chance to repair it- popularity points (which u must collect manualy)- If u turn off advice or mission guidelines, it's hard or sometimes u CAN'T turn it on again.- ESC doesn't work for menu, u must click ""ZOO"" in game bar, which is annoying, but u can survive this.

												Pretty decent simulator game.  My only gripe is that it is very tedious to delete/destroy an object.  You should just be able to click and select the delete key.Graphic:  8/10 (for a sim like this)Sound:    6/10  (meh, Pandora ftw)Control:  6/10  (needs better delete option, and hotkeys)Overall Fun:   Making animals, learning about local zoology, researching, etc., ALL FUN "

												I was feeling nostalgic for Zoo Tycoon, so I thought this might feel the void. It didn't. It's far too simple and feels rather pointless. You wait ages for stuff to research, and the ""scenario"" is basically a bunch of pretty basic achievs with rewards, all within the one zoo. Foliage (required by all the animals) are extremely simple and limited to a few choice trees and shrubs per continent, so everything looks the same. There's no landscaping. And visitors want ""features"" also limited to a very few hedges, statues and fountains to clutter up the place. You can't really micro manage at all, only cure the animals (who tend to get sick all the time) and direct your keepers to clean the exhibits or feed the animals. It's so shallow and boring. Off to play Roller Coaster Tycoon again, at least that one is fun. I hope Zoo Tycoon or an acceptable replacement will one day be available on Steam, but this... is not it.			"
