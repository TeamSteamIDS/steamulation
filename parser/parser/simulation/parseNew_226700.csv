												From someone who has over 500 hours in this game, I can tell you that this game is not worth $1, not anymore atleast.It used to be fun in alpha, before they started tweaking everything, and giving streamers special treatment, and hiring people who bashed the game constantly.There's bugs everywhere, there's always been bugs, and there will always be bugs because the developers are either clueless or were only trying to make a quick buck. Also, they didn't take one small thing from all the other MMO's.. A Public Testing Server.. As obvious as it might seem, that's something these money hungry developer's either didn't consider or just plain over looked due to costs / labor.There's been a cheating problem since the beginning and there will always be a cheater problem because instead of investing in an actual anti-cheat (Their current one is FairFight and it records statistics, all in-game bans are done by hand.) I seriously recommend you not play this unless you plan on cheating yourself because that is the only way you'll ever survive, unless you're actually somewhat decent at FPS's, which,  in that case, be prepared to be banned at random times because a streamer or someone well known in the community said you cheated.In the beginning, the developers stole their terms of service from League of Legends, banned people at random times to scare off cheaters (their version of an anti-cheat), and used fake screenshots which resulted in the game originally being pulled from steam. (Seriously.) It's for some reason been allowed back onto steam, and I believe everyone should know of this games terrible past and know that it's not changed one bit. Sergey Titov ""OP Productions, LLC. CEO"" (Previously known as Hammerpoint Productions) even went as far as to lie in interviews about this game, and delete any comments or reviews that said otherwise. Players who requested a refund originally were reported and blacklisted from the website which then caused them to have international troubles making any further purchases for anything, even things not involved with online games, I.E. General online shopping..Taken directly from a mod who previously worked for Hammerpoint / OP Productionshttp://leviathyn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/t6F9c.jpg (Source - http://www.leviathyn.com/news/2012/11/29/the-warz-team-blacklists-customers-asking-for-refunds-and-gets-blasted-by-ex-mod/ )Avoid this game at all costs.

Sure, some people have fun. But the majority despises it. The only time I remember enjoying myself in it, was upon release, hence the 200+ hours I have in game from forever ago. In the beginning it had a lot of hope, but it's nothing but a deathmatch game now. Score20/100(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!) "

Their solution BANN ALL PLAYERS WHO SUPPORT THE GAME ""just to be safe"". Yhea me and another hundred other innocent players got randomly banned for just playing the game this tells u just what lame♥♥♥♥♥cheat program they implement that dosen't even ban hackers just random players. In rage I wrote a polite ticket to the devs after a month or something the replied just saying they wont take anymore tickets from me or all the others in this situation so yhea I just wasted my money too some ♥♥♥♥ing scammer poser dev. ♥♥♥♥ YOU DEVS NEVER GONNA BUY ANY GAMES FROM THIS COMPANY ANYMORE AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO THESAME !(And btw the game wasn't that great anyways)Peace			"

												Honest Review:The less than 2 hours of my gameplay was riddled with Hackers using no clip, aimbot, superjump, super strength, unlimited health, no detection etc etc.I died countless times in 30 Minutes from hackers shooting more than 2.5 KM / 3 Miles away, through walls.The mechanics in the game are poor, as well as the melee.I want a refund please!This game should be put under review or removed from Steam!The developers don't care, as they have not bothered to patch it since a year ago!Credit the buyers of this game with vouchers or other!

												Unfortunately I had very bad experiences with this game in its entirety. There is an enormous amount of cheating going on, and the ban waves regularly ban non-cheaters. If I had to guess my Kill to Death ratio was somewhere around 1 to 10, if not worse- but I was scooped up in a ban wave as well. It uses an automated ban system, and they do not use any active moderation for banning. The notorious aimbot sites like artificial are still selling functional cheats that cannot be detected, so their only solution to this was banning anyone who has been reported.I was playing on a stream where it was visible I was not cheating and was still banned. Let that be a warning to other people looking to play this...... ""game"". I submitted a request to have my ban investigated, three months later I still had not received any word back.Unfortunately I was stupid enough to pay 5$ for the in game currency to purchase one of the survivors. Several friends who also paid for in game content were ""caught"" in the ban waves. No way to fight it, no refunds. Let that speak for itself.As you can see I had over 155~ hours in the game, and I tried very hard to give it a fair chance. There were a lot of good core ideas, but in the end it's a very poor attempt to cash in on DayZ popularity with no respect for the player base.			"

												How to create a bad game ? It's pretty simple. At first you have to get an inspiration. To find it, you will need a popular game. Cool ! You have selected Day Z ! Now, create a badly detailed terrain and add some villages which look almost exactly the same. Ok, now take all of the bugs that exist in Day Z and add them to the game. Well, we already have a bad looking glitched map ! Now it's time for some gameplay. Create a typical american character, put some badass clothes on him, make him muscular, add a cool face expression and steal all the animations from Fallout 3 just to make it look like cowshit. Don't forget that you have to let this guy shoot and wear some armor ! You just have to place deadly military weapons all over the map. Especially in supermarkets ! Everyone knows that a real supermarket should offer a good shotgun next to BBQ accesories. Now, when your character is able to run around with a submachine gun you have to place some targets. Exactly ! Spawn thousands of zombies which must be as glitched as the map is (it has to create a perfect composition) and make their corpses bulletproof. Good job ! Now your map is filled with supernatural people living after death who can't get killed after 2000 shots in the torso but they die after a punch in the face by a flashlight ! Now it's the time for the final spice, a cherry at the top of a cake ! It's time for a Pay 2 Win model. There is no such a thing that would make this game even worse, than a Pay 2 Win model. A market with dozens of overpowered weapons which you are able to buy for real money ! That's what we need ! Congratulations ! You've just made an another useless game ! Keep on going with such projects ! Community will appreciate the effort that you've put into this project !			"

												I want to be fair to this game but so far my experiences with it have been really bad.You start by getting thrown into the wild miles from everything with no idea what to do, when you finally make it to somewhere you're forced to sneak about in near useless fashion to collect supplies and HOPE you get a decent weapon- which doesn't matter if it's melee because the combat in this game is just dreadful.Having to run for 40 minutes through nothing is also dreadful.Oh and the stupid zombie movement and that delightly lag thing when enemies hit you where you were rather than where you are.I cannot in a clear mind recommend this game in it's current state because so far I've yet to find anything positive to say and I truly regret buying this game. I hope it gets better and become worth the time but right now, it's not worth it.			"

												One of the worst game experiences I've ever had.Game crashes, bugs everywhere and they charge real money to revive your character or you have to wait to play again. The dev's are always trying to change minor things but never fix what it has to be fixed: crashes, server kicks and include a decent anti cheat to ban 50% of the players that are all cheaters.Almost every week they launch a new patch to ""fix the bugs"" and it brings tons of new bugs on what it was working fine before.The game is clearly unfinished and they ask money for it. Do not buy it!Now they added a hotkey that you can instantly access marketplace and buy items anytime on the game (with real money of course). So if you got hit by a zombie, just press F10 and buy a vaccine. If you're dying of hunger or thirst, just buy some food and meds. You don't need to loot anymore. If you are on an insane PVP and you're out of ammo, just hit F10 and buy some clips for your guns.This is ridiculous pay to win. This game is a complete joke.Please rename the game again to Infestation: Shopping Stories.			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories ( better known as The WarZ ) is a zombie survival sim. It's absolutely horrible, though. The devs took a great idea that had so much potential and... well, turned it to crap basically. Let's start our review off with the Graphics. They aren't bad, but they aren't special or anything. They're just your average everyday video game graphics. Next up, the gameplay. Well, like I said, great idea turned to crap. You can explore a large open-world (if you don't crash within the first 5 minutes of joining a server), which has a wide array of locations from cities to abandoned shacks in the forest. You can explore these areas in hope of finding basic supplies, such as food, water, and health. Once you have the basics covered, you can begin looking for more things that aren't nessecary, but make the game alot easier, such as weapons and armor. Of course, being a zombie survival game, the thing contains zombies. In my short time playing the game, I found zombies teleporting around, spotting you from miles away, and attacking you when they weren't even near you. With the help of microtransactions, you can buy points to use in an in-game store (which kinda ruins the whole survival aspect). I don't know if this was fixed from the time I played, but if you bought points and your character dies, the points ""die"" with the character. Just imagine buying 15 dollars worth of digital credits, only for a zombie to bite you a second after the purchase- 15 dollars down the drain. The replayability would be high, considering you have an urge to play everytime you die and improve. But, because of the state of the game, this factor is significantly lowered. The soundtrack isn't that good. It feels like it was rushed and stuffed into the game, and sometimes tracks play when they're not supposed to. For example, I killed a zombie, and the battle theme kept playing. I checked the area and about 10 minutes later, the track kept playing. Then, of course, it stopped playing right as I entered a real battle.Overall, I would just say don't get it and save your money for something better. I apologize for being repetitive, but, again, great idea turned into crap.hey wow ok super post-publish edit you should probably not get this game thanks			"

												No.EDIT: People were commenting ""Why would you play this game for so long?""The only reason why i played this game is because my computer was so garbage, i couldn't run the dayz mod (at the time dayz standalone wasn't out) so i just played this instead, all on low, 600x800, 15-20 FPS, as with the dayz mod i got about 2 fps. And i have to admit, i did enjoy this game. but, you never really get anywhere in this game, its extremely hard to meet up with friends, they make the zombies extremely powerful just so your forced to buy the ingame purchases, this is truely a pay to win game.  just play dayz. the price difference is really worth it.EDIT 2: I no longer have the garbage laptop i used to have, i have an Acer aspire v5 with a nvidia geforce 720m card, and i can run it all on high. still wouldn't play it.

												This game was super terrbile in the beggining, so bad that it forced me to uninstall. I delt with hackers, glitching zombies and horrible graphics. Finally after half a year of wondering if they've lifted their game, I decide to reinstall. Well, I can't even get into servers and when I do I get a message saying I'm banned for a Multihack. I decide to head onto the forums to request for my account to be reviewed but then it hits me. I really can't be bothered, this game isn't worth my effort. I'm going to take my ban as a blessing and finally leave this festering mess behind. Good work Sergy, you are a foreskin and you need to be circumsized from the gaming world, I hope you get cancer.

												You guys should seriously sit on your asses and work on this game.First of all we payed for it. After Purchasing this game you have to use real money to buy guns and equiptment to surive. If not you have to go through a town of 1000 zombies that kill you instantly while it takes you 1 million hits to kill them.This game is a real cheap version of DayZ and it bugs the f**** out of me of what more they could of done to improve this game. First of all don't make us buy a game where you have to pay real money to♥♥♥♥♥♥a zombie up the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Make it more realistic and fix the bloody combat because its worse than Elder Scrolls Morrowind. Make it 12 hits to kill a zombie instead of 1 million7 Hits with a Melee weapon1-4 shots depending what type of gun you haveAnd Bingo at least its a little more better than what you have at the moment.The game is set out alright and the atmosphere isn't to bad but still cheap.Its what you would expect from a game made in 2005. The pictures of the game through steam look so epic but trust me it isn't that great. Buy this game right now if you want but I warn you its garbage.If you really want us spending money for this so called game fix it up and update it every bloody week. If not, continue being scammers and using our money to watch your HD p*** EITHER WORK ON THIS MOREOR DELETE IT CAUSE ALMOST EVERYONE HATES IT SO FAR! "

												I myself as a player that has played since Alpha would not recommend this game due to the fact that all this company really wants is your money. There for a while it was definitely a pay to win game. Wait what am i saying it is still a P2W game!! You buy GC which tansfers into zombie cash to buy armor/ammo/meds/attachments and in the end instead of spending hours of looting you can spend 5 minutes and $50.00 to get all the loot you want instead of actually looting. I'd put money on it that sooner or later HP will make guns able to be bought for GC/ZC.They said they wouldn’t do that but it  will happen. They don’t hold their word on anything and they constantly allow their game to go on sale and that feeds the hackers and hackers feed on our hard earned loot. Hackers right now run the game. They patch every two weeks and their patches consists of fixes for the previous patch they put out at the last minute! So in the end they screw one thing up that took them two weeks to make and the next patch actually fixes the previous weeks patch. The Devs in the game only care about theirselves. No I didn’t get banned so you can’t say that im salty becasue of a ban i do still play the game just not as much. i used to play at least 8 hours a day and spent hundreds of dollars on this game. I’m just letting people know that it’s not worth their $15.00. BUT if the game goes on sale for 4.00 again which I’m sure it will here soon as they are probably running low on cash then you guys should buy it then and only then. LIke i said i do still play but it gets old when the devs screw their oldest supporters!!			"

So I went and looked at the Terms of Service and On one of the sections (section 5a) it says that the company can ban/suspend accounts at any time for any reason or no reason whenever they want. Also, it states that customer support will not help with your account because they THOUGHT I was cheating so thats cool. So you are just buying the game and if you play legit you get banned and you cant talk to customer supportDont buy this piece of s***. It has a lot of little bugs but they get to your nerves after a while. Too many hackers. ToS says they can ban you anytime without a reason.

												DISCLAIMER: I PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE IT WAS RELEASED TO STEAM AND EVERYONE GOT A SPECIAL KEY!!!!! DON'T COMMENT IF YOU HAVE NO CLUE!Infestation: Survivor Stories; original The War Z, the worst game created currently.GraphicsThe graphics are terribly made, the animation is worse than Diablo 1 back then and they run like in Diablo 1. My i7-3770k 4,0 GHz CPU can't handle this game, my GPU is a GeForce GTX670 4GB Tri-Force, and i have FPS drops. Even Assassins Creed IV: Black Flag is running better.SoundThe gunweapons sound like recorded with a phone instead of something better out there. Zero atmosphere, i feel like a zombie, not a survivor. The steps are giving me issues.Gameplay Infestation: Hacker Stories is a better term for this game. The weapons are poor and unbalanced and it's the worst of all Zombiesurvivals. If i run around, from place to place over miles, without a car or anything, i could go AFK run and cry myself into a pillow why i actually bought the game. DayZ had good places around, but this is hilarious. But if you got something, nope, you die.Oh, if you jump 2 feet down, you lose half of your health points, for no reason. CommunityI rather play Call of Duty on XBoX and i don't own one. People tend to kill each other, which is allowed, but they run braindead around and spawncamp with snipers. No fun allowed guys!EndYeah, 10/10 would not buy. I wasted 27 US-Dollar back in the day and got my money back, because it's a simple fraud. But to warn you guys, it is the worst game around, the Metascore is a bloodier red than a menstruation. Please guys, don't support trash.			"

												This game is the evolution of gaming, so many splitting edge game mechanics such as dying from a zombie that is 10 metres away from you, absolutely incredible devs that really listen to the community and constantly improve this masterpiece of a game and not to mention the incredibley original idea of an open world zombie survival mmo. Graphics that make Crysis 3 look like Mario Bros, really smooth gameplay and animations. What really makes this magnificent is the concept of microtransactions, even though I already payed for the game, I feel as though the devs need to be rewarded even further by giving them more of my hard earned money for really useful stuff such as hats. What also really improves gameplay is that it is pay to win, greatly improves the overall experience. Worst game I have ever had the misfortune of playing 10/10. WARNING: Playing this game will most likely diagnose you with leukemia.			"

												This is one masterpiece you can NOT pass up. This game might have the power to cure cancer, HIV, and possibly amputated limbs. This game also possesses a euphoric effect. If you don't get this game, your chances of getting brain cancer are de-, increased by 99.9% and there is a 0% chance that you will be unsatisfied. This game should be the 8th Wonder of the World. I have 4 780 tis in my computer as well as 2 I7 4770s and 64GB of Ram, 50 Terabytes of hard drive space, and custom liquid nitrogen cooling, but since this game is so well made, and so much effort was put into this game, that I only run it at 20 fps. This game's graphics are so amazing, the scenery so breathtaking, that I had a heart attack 27 times in a row. This game's combat is fast-paced and exhilarating. The combat is also realistic and rewarding. I hit a zombie with my metal flashlight in it's face repeatedly for 5 minutes, and when it died I got a fun-sized Milky Way candy bar. It's almost like the apocalypse is really happening! I explored the entire map for 6 hours and I found a slingshot in a police department! This game isn't Game of the Year, this game is Game of the Century. It's amazing combat, beautiful scenery, and realistic loot system, make this the best game I have ever played. I will never play any other game ever again. 10/10			"

												The only reason I didn't uninstall this crap is to be able to give it a negative review!I got this on sale with a coupon for under $4 and I still feel ripped off!Basically, they just made a terrain and some controllable characters... and that's it. I would like to discuss game mechanics or game play, but there isn't any. You get a character with horrible and in some cases barely responsive controls, so you can glitch around a horrible world design. I was in  situation where I couldn't jump over 1 foot fence, but I had no problem walking over and on top of people. Fight mechanics... HA! You will spend hours just watching what seems to be a 2 frame motion of your character moving his hand up and down.... up and down... up and down ... until you or the attacker drop. There really is no game here. They use the term ""Open World"" to hide the fact that they didn't ( or couldn't) make such a broken world work for anything else. It really feels like a failed project that original programmer abandon and gave to someone with less skill to develop. I have seen school kids make a better game then this using a free game maker in ONE DAY!But wait, THERE IS MORE! Act now and you will get their version of Punk Buster Service added to your computer. It takes up room, it's always on using up your bandwidth and overheating your CPU and.... you can't uninstall it even if you run as an administrator! TRUE! Strangely enough this awful blight they required me to install on my system so I can play this horrible game, DOES NOT WORK! I've seen people spawn weapons, ammo, unlimited health and such with no problem. But if server you are playing on is updating you will get booted and logged as a cheater. Also, if your time on the server is different or daylight saving time comes on, or your ping shoots up, or you run another program, or you try to listen to music, or windows update, or you don't have the new windows update, or you receive an e-mail on your open browser, or any other random reason you will get booted and sent message that Punk Buster caught you cheating. Oh, did I mention you can't uninstall it? This is not a game. This is just a money grab for this company. They hope they will get enough people to build a community so the game keeps going due to people, because they know they got nothing. That's why they invested more effort in marketing of this game instead of developing it. It came out in 2012 and still has the same issues!We should all start a petition to include this game on Norton or Kaspersky virus lists, so before you can download it your computer stops you from making this mistake and erase it for you. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! EVER! Your money would be better spent on getting a tattoo on a side of bleeding haemorrhoid!DO NOT INSTALL EVEN IF IT'S FREE!MOVE ALONG! NOTHING TO SEE HERE! "

												WARNING DISCLAIMER: VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED - THIS GAME HAS ZOMBIES! ABOUT THE GAME: * A Huge Persistent World: This is an (non)linear open world game, where everything looks absolutely the same!  * Explore trees, Scavenge really useless stuff, try to KILL (!!!) Zombies, and die really often! * In-game money - if you want good stuff you will have to pay silly amounts of money for it! * You are one of the few survivors and must navigate the desolate and poorly animated countryside exploring cities and scavenging for items that you will never have any use for! * Group with a surprisingly big number of other players to increase your non-existent chances of survival - experience trees together! KEY FEATURES: * Combination of First-Person and Third Person Perspectives - you can choose in which camera angle you want to look at trees and get killed in! * Meld of PVE (Player versus Environment) and PVP (Player versus Player) - get killed by Zombies or even OTHER players! * Safe Settlements where Players can access their global inventory - practical for storing your useless loot! * Trees! * Create your own Clans - you will possibly avoid boredom even longer! * Adrenaline pumping activities - run, walk, jump! * Swimming - animations that would make a senile robot jealous! * Reputation system – choose to become a lawman or bandit; there is no difference! * Leave Messages for friends in the game world with a time capsule - tell other players about the trees YOU have seen! * Immersive environment with unique and spine ch(k)illing sound effects - they will actually scare you with their poor quality! * Huge variation of melee and firearm weapon types - finding them is impossible! (Never ever even consider to buy this compilation of low-budget robot animations, pixilated textures, unrealistic moaning sounds and invincible walking corpses - not even on sale! Seriously, your eyes wil burn, your brain will rot and your ears will bleed by experiencing this kind of low quality.)  "

												The devs are trolls that can't be taken serious. If the devs were actually professional, fixed it and not d1cking around then the game would be 10/10. But because the devs have the IQ of a sandwich it's 1/10. 1 being for 5% effort they put in. Worse game. Don't buy even on sale, don't play even if it's gifted to you.

												I owe my life to this game, i was morbidly obese, about to die from obesity, but when i laid eyes on this game, i emptied my stomach contents on to my keyboard, and lost ten pounds. later that night i sh*t myself, because i was dreaming of the amazing graphics of the game. i then decided to take drastic measures, i went to the bank, pulled off a heist, and got away with the $5 needed for the spectacular game that is infestation: survivor stories, i went home to insert the five dollar bill into my disk drive, for some reason, my computer didnt buy the game, so i had to go back to the bank i robbed, in order to refund my five dollars. once i got home the second time, it worked. i bought the game and started to play it, I instantly started masturbating to the female character and male character that you start with. once i implanted my seed into my computer, i spawned into the game, i then realized how spooky the game was, and i was like ""woah"". i proceeded into the game, and i found that there is microtransactions. after i discovered this, i went to the developers, and r*ped every one of them repeatedly whispering in their ears ""this is my swamp..."" they were terrified of my green skinned 210 lb body. they're dead now.UPDATE: The cops are on to me, it never occured to them that an outcast such as me would live in the swamp... until now, i only have a couple of minutes to write this before the angry mob of Warz fanboys break down my corroded and decayed cypress tree door. i can already hear the moldy wood breaking, but my friends do not fear, for when i am gone, my little furry donkey will hold the fort and make waffles for everyone. do not fear the terrors of the world with out me. do not fear farquaad, for he is short, stout, and a little b*tch. go on to live my legacy, my children, for i am the one you praise                                               Love,                                                     Shrek224/10 best game in the world			"

												The idea of a game like that is perfect. but the fact that people play it like any FPS ruins the game. When U first spawn, start looking for items, but you see a player and he kills you without thinking. So the game is hard to play alone, and you fear humans not zombies.Another thing is that the support is horrible. they take too long to answer, when they answer sometimes they dont say what they said they would do. for example, i was banned unfairly, one of the banned accouns for no reason. they told me that in 1 week they would unban me after looking for the log and seeing i was a regular player. 1 week later account still banned and they told me they couldnt unban, thatit was permanent.i spent 60 bucks on the game to get the legendary pack, played since alpha, and then suddenly im banned. hate the support.

												Saw this on sale, got rather excited....and than I played it.  I payed just over 3$ for this game and honestly it would not be worth it even if it were free.  This is completely a pay-to-win game hands down.  The servers are filled to bursting with hackers (shocking on the internet right?)  The ""fair fight"" system is honestly a crock of♥♥♥♥♥♥  The loot table needs a serious over haul, the zombie AI needs some dusting off.  Over all if you are looking for a great way to♥♥♥♥♥♥away your hard earned money this is for you.  For the majority of you out there that would actually like to be entertained, RUN! RUN FAR AND RUN FAST!  Normally I would hold off on writting such a horrible review but I can not even begin to fathom why steam would even allow this farce.  Research this games past and it is hard to believe the devs. (aspiring to be actual devs. more like) are not serving jail time.  This game used to be called WarZ, it has been taken down from steam before.  Sadly this game has SOOOOOO much potential, but this is what happens when dev. teams only want to make a quick buck.  I DO NOT recommend this game to anyone...ever.  Thanks for reading! Any questions feel free to msg/add me!			"

												Last I played it was 6/10/2013. The game at that time was very buggy and filled with hackers. I am going to base this review/recommendation on that. The game is fun but hard to make friends and easy to find enemys. Looters are more annoying then zombies, and respawning is a, well ♥♥♥♥♥. They have people camped up on ridges in glitch rocks or trees with aimbot and hud player markers. They even have people who find ways under the map to ""troll"" you. I for one never, ever cheat. So when I see this I intantly write the game off as a failed project. Don't buy this, its just a sleezy version of DayZ.			"

Now believe me I tried to enjoy this game I really did, but the dull boring lazy work really throws it into a pit of fire shot up a million times beaten up to the fullest and out comes a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.

												I've played this game since Alpha.. had around 4,000 hours (non-steam) and let me say a few things:This game is a good game when it comes to surviving, maybe not one of the best... but when it comes to handling guns, I like it. Then all the rest of the things about this game is awful. You see hackers even in PRIVATE SERVERS.The worst part of this game is the Anti-Cheat, got banned because the map glitched and started teleporting me upwards and I hit the skybox, and got disconnected. The next day I got banned for potential nocliping because the map in the middle of nowhere was giving my bugs. I was going under the map (dying from that) and also glitching up the skybox (disconnecting from that)This game is gone downhill since Alpha, and is even taking a bigger step to becoming one of the shitiest games on Steam.Extremely dissapointed with the Anti-Cheat system, fix that up if you want to have a chance of getting some proper reviews.

												""One of the worst games of all time"" ""An absolute joke""""Worst game on Steam""These were the things I heard when people talked about Infestation: Survivor Stories. This game became centered with controversay back in 2012 because of the developers threatening consumers and consumers revealing that the developers had lied to them and also having one of the worst launches on Steam when it was first released. As well as the developers banning people from the forums of anyone requesting a refund.I've stayed clear of this game for a while but, curiosity killed me and I decided to pick it up during the summer sale.I want to make things clear, this isn't as bad as people are making it out to be, this game doesn't deserve the title ""worst game of all time"" it isn't even the worst game on Steam. Is it bad? yes, it is definately bad, no question or debate about that, but it's not as bad as others are making it out to be, either that or I had my expectations set way too low when I was playing this.In case you hyadn't figured it out from the trailer, Infestation: Survivor Stories was a game that tried to capitalise on the popularity of DayZ (Infestation used to be named ""The War Z"" however due to the bad behaviour of the devs being revelaed, it was removed, then came up again as Infestation: Survivor Stories) Like most DayZ rip offs, Infestation takes everything that people enjoyed about DayZ and then makes them worse, connections, graphics, community all of these things are worse than DayZ.One thing that is included in Infestation, which is kind of a cool idea, is that depending on which server you choose to play on, you will play on a different map, I say that what I really mean is that out of the 8 servers, there are 2 different maps. If you have 8 servers, why not add in a different map for each server? Was there something limiting you from doing that, some sort of restriction?The maps themselves, however, are really big, around a 74km2 mile map, There is also alot of unique areas around the map that you can encounter and are used frequently to make sure there's always something to see and something that you will want to check out, which is more than I can say for the other DayZ clone that this company made (Aftermath).One thing that you'll realise quickly however, is that the devs purposefully make the good equipment hard to find, when I say hard to find, I mean really hard to find, as in there's a 1/1000 chance in finding it, that's where the f*cking microtransactions come into play. Obviously if you're going to rip off a popular gam, charging £20 as it's base price and then half a*sing everything, you need to make sure you get even more money from it as well by putting in microtransactions for outfits, armour and weapons.The community on this is mostly horrific. You might find the odd good player that is willing to team up with you, but it's primarily hackers, cheating and the devs doing little about it, however, now that there's barely anyone playing it, it's hard to come by these guys anymore, however they're still present throughout the game.The zombie AI is also terrible, all you need to do to beat them is walk backwards and mash the LMB and you're guaranteed a win, they only become a big problem if you have zombies coming from different directions. Zombies don't even appear to be a huge problem when they're in hoardes, whereas zombies would usually be. There is also no way you can sneak by a zombie, once you enter their proximity (even if you're behind them) they will come after you regardless.The graphics are mostly bad. If you're looking at a view, surveying the area or something along those lines, the graphics look quite decent, however, as soon  as you get closer to something, you will notice how badly textured they are.I will agree that this is a bad game, but I wouldn't stress out that it's one of the worst game on Steam, as I can easily see more games that I've covered before that can fill that hole, like Day One: Garry's Incident, Second Warfare or The Slaughtering Grounds. I will agree on the fact that this is nonetheless a bad game with minimal effort put in and it's only use was to be a cash grab and try and piggy back on the popularity of DayZPros+ Decent graphics from afar+ Huge map+ Can be fun exploringCons- Bad textures-Bad AI-Hackers-Microtransactions-RipoffFinal verdict: 4/10My Steam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews "

												Incredibly good game.Played for 10 minutes, crashed on attempting to join a server.Restarted, waited to join a server again. Success! I've gotten in. It's dark, for some reason my character is glowing yellow and looks like lava.I have no idea how to get this damn flashlight out of my hands.I see a house in front of me, I slowly make my way there.Zombies are spotted. I run into the house. Empty. I try to run out but the zombies are blocking the doorway and apparently it's impossible to run past them.I'm dead. Zombies are eating me alive.Able to respond in 90 seconds. Waits 90 seconds.I'm taken back to the character screen. You can respond again in 18 minutes. Wow I only have to wait 18 minutes to relive that thrilling 1 minute in the game again? Sweet deal, bro!!But wait, if I don't want to wait to jump back into the excitement then there is an option to pay to re spawn. Incredible.Exited the game. Best waste of $1.50 I ever spent. 10/10 Way better than Day-Z.			"

The worst milk. 4) Old people. 4.5) Old people who think they can drive, who enter the motorway the wrong way drive at 30mph southbound up the northbound carriage and hit a van full of disabled children head on, leaving them more disabled.5) Dayz 5.5) H1Z1 5.7) Rust5.9) Anything developed by EA6) Counter-Strike Global Offencive. 7) Cheaters, Hackers, or anyone who claims to have obtained my IP address through omegle. 8) Sauce on beans on toast, because it ruins the structural integrity of the bread. 9) Warm drinks. 10) Hugh JackmanI would really rather sit staring deep in my monitor while it was turned off, waiting for the girl from ""The Ring"" to come out and drag me into her well than ever play this again.

(Artimis is a admin and personally bans cheaters on stream)Told him that I was a hacker and wanted to know when I was getting a bad.He told me ""all hackers get banned"".I explained that I have been hacking in this game and getting unfair kills for a month.He said ""you should be banned soon"".Month later I came back to his stream to tell him that I wasn't banned yet.He told me ""then you aren't a cheater, we have a really good cheat and hacking detection system"".I then gave him screenshots of me hacking.He said it was fake and if it was real I would be banned.I followed him on a stream and killed players next to him on the map and server he was on. I used blatant hacks with another hack subscription.He thought it was funny.I asked where my ban was.He still thinks I am not a cheater.Point is, hacking system is flawed and Artimis is autistic as ♥♥♥♥. This story took place months ago and to this day I am not banned.Buy this game.			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												A very bad game. I think the worst thing is players killing players for no reason. I would not recommend this game to anyone. Unless you got hacks, cause you're gonna get mad, and wonder why people are so stupid. Or unless you played with your buddies who you know won't kill you and will help you to survive. It's a type of game that can go really good, and in one minute you can lose everything.			"

I buy a car for a lot of money , i was riding for 10 minutes then i exited the car and i try to pick up it  but the car exploded and i was kicked from the server , reason - SPEEDHACK .

												This game has to be the worst of the worst when it comes to an all around experience. I totalled about 10 hours of ( at times forced) gameplay.(Graphics) - It has a beautiful landscape I give it that, but is also a FORCED beauty on your machine. The recent updates took away almost all controls over your video/hardware settings and forced all players to run at what the Developers want you to run.  The outcome is an even more terribly optimized experience rendering all low-end pc's ( fps 30 before update, ran great) unoperable. Fps even for high-end users is a 10 fps experience due to lack of extended work.(Gameplay) - The gameplay varies but is generally just as terrible. The difference from the critically acclaimed DayZ and this { turd taped to a radiator} is that this is heavily influenced by the cash shop. Everything required for long term survival is bought on the cash shop i.e powerful guns/equipment/ammo EVERYTHING. Safe zones are camped, item spawns are not randomized and are also camped. Game time can consist of short survival times due to cashshoppers and the frequent HACKER.(UI/Community/Support) The maps are big enough, but are suffocating when the server is full. Aside from a couple small settlements and a handful of cities there is NOTHING outside of those areas. Lots of space and very barren unless you love seeing trees. The zombie mechanics are horrible, they run twice as fast as you and apparently have a 10ft reach. The game has glitches left and right and have not been addressed at all. The Developer support is almost nonexistent with little to no cooperation with the community. The weekly updates consist of no major update fixes to glitches and consist of Dev's either ""saying"" they will be doing an update or going on little breaks. There is no major support from the Game Dev's and have not been any in a long time.I give it a Charlie Brown rating of meh/10. Move along people, nothing to see here			"

												I'm not going to lie. This game is a blatant rip-off of DayZ. Yes, it has tried to change. Yes, it does have a lot going for it. In fact, it isn't a bad game - what makes it almost unplayable is the business model set by the game developers.I'm used to Pay2Win mechanics in F2P games, but Infestation actually is a bought game - yet it requires microtransactions for almost every bit amount of fun in it. Due to this, very few people play it.In fact, I only encountered one other player and only I could see him. We agreed over the public chat to go our seperate ways and then I never saw a person since.This game could be good, but only if the developers stop being stupidly greedy.			"

But hey, I'm playing it on Steam, I don't have any password to access the game.

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."" Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- ""Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway. "

												For a game you buy and pay money I didn't expect a system where you have to pay for stuff with real money to get some advantage. The way you get guns is to make a server ( and you have to pay for that ) and or join a clan and pay them to be on the server , then everyone just waits for weapons to spawn and when they get their stuff they switch server and kill newbies. This is no fun and I regret buying this game.Plus you dont have easy/fast deslocation from a point to another to play with friends and there is no friend system at all so you have to pick the same server and pray to god to spawn close to each other. I give this game a 3.5/10.			"

Got (finally) a backpack, a decent club and some supplies to keep me going.I walk thru a airbase, there were to much zombies in front of me so I turned around. I see someone with an AK and was dead.People who are very proud of themselves for killing someone who had only a flashlight.And being instantly killed by other people, who did sunk money into the game to buy decent gear.All in all it has potential but as long as there is no PVE option I can not recommend this game.Burning the money paid for this game gives more satisfaction!

												Being able to express the disapointment in a games company in the handling of it's consumer, let alone the targets it promised yet failed to reach, is now shrouded in fear of being banned, cautioned or even having legal material on your YouTube channel flagged for Copyright Infringement. Presumably on the sole reason for it highlighting the frustration a dedicated customer of the game (since day1) felt after having so much faith in the title to then feel rather let down and bemused as to why they still don't deliver what they set out to in the beginning Hammerpoint Interactive aren't strangers to controversy and to this day continue to be the most unprofessional games company i have ever witnessed, in context of dealing with customers as well as the media them selves. I wrote an article on my ordeal with Hammerpoint Interactive and this game in particular that managed to go viral, thanks to the Steam and gaming community in general and also bumped the traffic and support towards the YouTube channel my self and my friends started. Hammerpoint Interactive created a streisand effect trying to silence a small YouTube channel, that had 11 followers and instead AGAIN expressed to the general public how childish they can be when it comes to criticism of their below par, fraudulent product...the history of them selve's with Steam is enough to example that.If they left my video alone and had it sit there in it's purely legal state that it was, i'd recommend this game, but because they don't take criticism of their product in a proffesional manner and don't act like a serious company towards their consumers even when the DEV's of the company are caught explotiting the game on live streams, destroying their customers enjoyment of the game to which they then ban the users on forums for outing them (as they rightly should), then i wouldn't...ever.

If you thought it was bad having 5 out of 10 people with m4's and snpiers posted at 500 yards; you havent seen the cheaters yet! I had started played this game in late 2012 and ended early 2013 and have only been checking on it since. The games community gets smaller and smaller day by day and the devs have NO plans to change ANYTHING, they have literally stated so.

												The money would have been better spent buying drugs for homeless men.  This game is a perfect representation of why game designers should focus more on the player then on themselves.  This has been in the works for years with little progress to show for it, and little support for players who suffer actcual monetary loss at the expence of the design.  Do yourself a favor and buy one of the many great titles actually backed by steam rather then a group of ametur programmers who will never put in the work to make this game anything more then a half baked money moaking scheme.  Instead spend your money one of the many othe Steam games that doesn't coerce you to pay more for so called ""Premium Benifits"" where other gamers who have learned the exploits of the game over years of time will show you just how far your money can get you.

												This is one masterpiece you can NOT pass up. This game might have the power to cure cancer, HIV, and possibly amputated limbs. This game also possesses a euphoric effect. If you don't get this game, your chances of getting brain cancer are de- increased by 99.9% and there is a 0% chance that you will be unsatisfied. This game should be the 8th Wonder of the World. I have 4 780 Titans in my computer as well as 2 I7 4770s and 64GB of Ram, 50 Terabytes of hard drive space, and custom liquid nitrogen cooling, but since this game is so well made, and so much effort was put into this game, that I only run it at 20 fps. This game's graphics are so amazing, the scenery so breathtaking, that I had a heart attack 27 times in a row. This game's combat is fast-paced and exilharating. The combat is also realistic and rewarding. I hit a zombie with my metal flashlight in it's face repeatedly for 5 minutes, and when it died I got a fun-sized Milky Way candy bar. It's almost like the apocalypse is really happening! I explored the entire map for 6 hours and I found a slingshot in a police department! This game isn't Game of the Year, this game is Game of the Century. It's amazing combat, beautiful scenery, and realistic loot system, make this the best game I have ever played. I will never play any other game ever again. 10/10			"

												Was a great escape from other games and play a post apocalyp zombie survival game. Where the most dangerous enemy is your fellow man, you are never safe. I must say this game always kept me on edge, expecting the unexpected. The unexpected thing I didn't see coming is the developers shutting down the servers. This game is no longer supported. Steam should remove this from being purchased until developers return.			"

												Worst game so far ive played, not only is this a ripoff, of you know what, but at the same time they dare lure us to spend even MORE money after the game purchase. this should be a free to play, with ingame purchase able items. not both purchaseable, its a complete ripoff, and i can only reccomend you stay away from this. last time i reccomended this i got alot of trash talk so heres something to make them shut uphttp://dayzdev.tumblr.com/THIS GAME IS NOT DayZ STANDALONE!

Please note: I was a pre-Alpha tester who played this game from day #1 My gametime exceeds 500 hours of non-steam gameplay.This is currently one of the worst ""Zombie Survival MMO's"" on the market. The developers of this game decided to not go the ""good"" route but spend their time soley on implementing more and more ways to spend more money inside the game (aka a cash shop) and to boost the PvP. Both things were not a problem when the game started in early alpha. Yes, i am serious. The early alpha was a very good, yet unstable game. You could freely roam a small world full on zombies, rare of supplies and weapons and occasionly meet other players and either fight or ignore them. The devs expanded the map, greatly expanded the weapon & ammo drop rate, made zombies nearly no threat and decided to implement various ways of unfair advantages. Packages full of weapons and supplies which you could buy for real money.A cash shop which you could access from anywher ein the world (later changed).Death cooldown timers, only resettable via cash. [...]Nowadays this game mostly only features PvP fights full of cashers & / or hackers. There always was a hackerproblem and they were sadly never able to fix it. Instead they focussed on developing a new zombie survival game which is just an advanced, yet still bad version of this one. Do not buy this game. It is neither worth your money nor do the devs deserve it!			"

												I started playing a few weeks back, and it was OK but I don't know if it was worth all the trouble it brought about. I had a good time killing zombies and hunting players. The game was challenging, but really the hardest part about playing this game has to have been telling my parents I am gay. I mean I really thought I was straight going into this whole thing, but boy was I wrong. I had to leave my parents house and am currently living in a mens shelter downtown.

												This game, (even though I bought it on sale) was a complete waste of money.Not only did it ban me for roughly 2 weeks for using aimbot when I don't even have stuff like that installed, sending in a ticket for support didn't get me anywhere either. They just don't bother replying.This game has terrible support and what sucks so much is that this game has so much potential, but yet it's so broken. If they would actually work on fixing this game, and actually care about their customers by actually replying to questions I'll give it another try, for now this game is in my ""♥♥♥♥♥♥games ""  pile.

												I got this game back in 2012, i was one of the few who actually pre-ordered it. I never stopped playing it since back then. I loved this game. I loved how it fused PVP & survival together. No survival game was able to create such great PVP, not even DayZ. However since the original developers left the game back in january the game left with them. The new company has released 1 patch since then and they're working on a new ""Infestation"" that will probably be a dissapointment aswell. It really sucks that i can't have back the awesome times back i had in 2013 with this game. Now only campers & hackers play this game. It's horrible. Most of my friends also left this game. So if you want a good Survival game, choose DayZ. If you want a good survival-pvp game, Wait for H1Z1. If you simply want Infestation. Wait for the ""new"" version. The developers are milking as much money as they can right now before they're gonna move on to make other games. I will use up my Global Inventory then uninstall this game and just let it rest.R.I.P The War Z (Oct, 2012- Dec, 2013) You will be missed.			"

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing. "

												This game is a total mess. You start with s*itty flashlight in a s*itty world with s*itty graphics and everything overall is s*itty. But wait! You can get all you want for an easy payment of 9999,99$ of microtransactions! Ignore the fact that this game actually costs money in the first place. So you decide to play this sh*t? All right! Good luck spawning in a bu*thole somewhere in the forest with a trillion zombies around you, and when you finally get to a city after... 15-20 minutes of running, someone with aimbot is most likely to shoot you down. Have fun waiting 20 minutes to respawn. Oh wait! You can buy the respawn for the real money too! How convenient! This is as far the WORST game I ever layed my hands on.

												So I'll write this review while being a little irked at this game.  I bought this game during the 2013 Steam Summer sales, and installed it and ran around for maybe 10 - 15 minutes in the game.  It was night so I exited and didn't bother to play it cause couldn't really do much in the dark.  Ended up having to uninstall for hard drive space. So today, 12/1/2013, I download it cause I'm bored and decided to try it out.  Get it installed, go to login to my account and can't remember the password, so I requested a password reset and did it.  Go to login to my account with my newly changed password, only to have the message ""You are permanently banned"" pop up.  Somehow I got banned while playing 15 minutes of the game ever.  GG, thanks for the aweseome experience developer.			"

												Nah guys, what you say is not right, no no no!I and a friend, have been camped in a PTE server at the motel roof in caliwood near the beach. We have been on the lookout for players until all of a sudden he died after 3 hits to the head from a player whose nick was about enough insulting. Then, I jumped up behind a barricade, and almost immediately I received few hits to the head and also died instantly, even though we both had full stuff gear and snipers on us, we died easy peasy. My friend then logged in on another character and also died instantly. In a while, we joined again, geared fully with snipers to hunt that player down. We went up on that roof and saw that player somewhat 200-300 meters in front of us and I stuck my head out to aim him with my magnum, and then I received 3 hits from him and died before I even noticed my health going down which was a surprise because I had a full skill tree. My friend, also died the same way have I. Later, whilst consistently checking the I:SS game blocks twitter bans, I have not seen the nickname of that player, it was clarified that this game is f. up and all of it's systems. What's even better though, is that I as a normal, legit player with over 250 kills have been banned by ""FairFight"". That guy, still hadn't been banned. That guy, used ESP, aimbot, no recoil and no clip whatever else he used; yet I the legit player have been banned FOR NOTHING.Thank you HP and OP, you are amazing. You cannot fix your bugs, and you cannot develop a game. All of yous are a bunch of useless clowns who just await the stupid players who are like ""take my moneys men"". I don't care this post isn't productive or constructive whatever the mods may call it, I will probably get banned for this post but believe me, this game isn't worth playing a minute. Worst management, and worst problem solving. ""FairFight"" keep it up! Make the game fair where the cheaters walk away free and legit players get banned, statistically!0/10 for this game.

												Not my type of game. Zombies are not the main enemy, just a hurdle. Presents no distinctive feature to the zombie theme, just control hunger and thirst, and some improvements by level of each character. Basically, what you can do in the game is: find weapons and equipment and kill other players to pick up their equipment and weapons, while trying to avoid being killed by zombies.PS: The vast map does NOT decreases the chances of you finding other players .... believe me.

The graphics are average and the gameplay isn't bad, but not good either. I will give the developers some credit, they are trying to get this game good and are adding stuff like vehicles and a California map which is 6x larger than the original Colorado map but due to their greed and the prices to buy simple items rather than find them in the game is outrageous and the fact you can't rent servers off normal providers, only through them using their expensive in-game currency which is ridiculous! I will keep dipping in and out every couple of patches to keep you guys in the loop on what's going on with this game but for now, don't bother.			"

												I was permanently banned from this game for no reason, just like 100s of other customers.  I didn't expect much from this game, but I figured I'd give it a try anyway.  After playing less than a minute when I purchased and closing it, I decided to have a go at it today after about 2 months and was informed by the launcher I was permanently banned.I'm currently waiting on their canned customer support ticket reponse that they've found evidence of multiple cheats used in game but they cannot tell me what, why or when and not to contact them again about the matter.I have absolutely NO idea why Steam continues to sell this game, expecially after forcing it off the marketplace for over a month after the developers deliberately lied and misled their customers at that time.Save yourself the headache and just buy DayZ Standalone.  A game that actually deserves your money, not this garbage which charges you to buy items in game after you've already purchased it.			"

												This game is nothing what you're expecting it to be. It's just a cheap attempt to re-create DayZ with terrible graphics and gameplay. The WarZ was first taken down from Steam because it claimed to have in-game stuff that was never actually added. The game itself is terrible. The zombies AI is terrible , along with the fighting animations and all other mechanics in it.			"

												What was once a great game, has fallen prey to lackluster development and more recently, despite this having been an issue from the get-go, it's horrendously monitored servers see a laughable number of user injected mods; giving cheating players a cruel and gamebreaking unfair advantage.Oh right, and literally everyone is a♥♥♥♥♥♥[Still, not as bad as the Day-Z], It's almost comically PTW - Ammunition is 400% [probably not exaggerating] easier to obtain via in-game microtransactions than it is to loot in-game. Decent armours and guns are a must-have, and although these can be obtained in-game, you are unlikely to survive as far as obtaining some unless you've already paid for the equivilant via microtransactions.Loved this game with friends, long before i returned alone; to log on with each of my characters and get instantly killed by cheating players injecting the ♥♥♥♥ out of the servers.Do i recommend this game? Not anymore... and any enjoyment i received from this game was from playing with friends when realistically we could all have better spent our time elsewhere.♥♥♥♥ing awful game, i feel the dev's owe me not only 108 hours of my life; but any money i poured into this to have wasted by cheating players on their god awful ♥♥♥♥♥torms of servers.My Rating -12 / 1 000 000.

												Worst game with the worst support ever. Do not buy this crap, developers removed the support page and are ignoring players that need help.Stay away from this and Aftermath its by the same developers.-Game has lots of map glitches you get stuck in places.-Hackers that are using aim and wall.-Broken hitbox.-Terrible optimization. (I have 39 FPS when im fighting zombies) -No more updates on the perks.-They closed half of the servers and most people lost their lockers (a safe witch you can store your items, if the server gets shut down you lose it for good and they do not give it back or get a refund.)-They remove stuff or increase the price in their in-game market for example the Personal Locker witch was 7$ is now 14$.My advise ignore this ca$h in, and find a better game.

												Greetings,First of all, I'd like to say that I enjoyed playing the game a lot during its prime time. I have had great time with my friends exploring and fighting the zombie hordes for the first time. I wish I could say the same for the rest of my experience, the game had great potential, I can say had because it is beyond repair, the game is run by Hammerpoint Interactive, just about the worst company in existance.Examples, crashes every 5 minutes, just an array of graphical issues, pc compatibility issues... what can I say, Alienware pc's can't run the game above 20 fps.... for todays standards ugly graphics, and oh, the cream on top, an absolute swarm of hackers, just about the only game where every single server is swarmed by hackers, I'm not talking about 1 or 2, 90% of servers current population is hacking, this is a fact.Anti cheat system there is simply for looks and that's pretty much that. To keep the story short, the game's head developer at the current time, the community manager, calls players doorknobs for trying to prevent the game becoming pay2win, one of the more polite words we have heard from the community manager.Absolute 0 communication with the player base, 0 bug fixes, there are bugs that first appeared in alpha that haven't been fixed, a whole year and some months ago gone by, company cares only about money. 0 customer support, people bought  in game currency for real money and never got what they paid for.In short, the absolute worst game of my life, sure it had some bright moments, but if you want to avoid getting cancer, don't buy this game ever.If this game was free to play I wouldn't recommend it.

												Good stuff:- Uninstalling! Now that's a thing that works without any problem in this game!- End of service as of November 2016!Bad stuff:- Terrible performance. I can run most games at their FPS limit with high graphics and stuff, but this? 5-10 FPS with low graphics and resolution. Damn.- When I first got the game, I played it for like one hour. Then I wanted to check my map to see where I was. Guess what? The game crashed when I tried to access it, and I couldn't restart it at all without reinstalling. Quality game dev.- Bugs and glitches everywhere. EVERYWHERE.- Man, I sure thought that the popular thing about zombies is that you should shoot them in the head to kill them. But I didn't know you needed an entire assault rifle mag for this.- Anti-cheat? Pretty much ""Let's place a gun here, where no one could possibly reach it! Anyone who grabs it gets banned, even if they're perfectly legit!"" and that's it. I mean really? What about actual hackers, eh?- This game was removed from Steam at some point. Why the ♥♥♥♥ is it back?- This game's past... Let's just not talk about it.- [AUGUST 13, 2015] Reinstalled this game to have a good laugh. Launcher said my Steam account doesn't own the game. GG.- Do I have to say more?- End of service as of November 2016, but they made a new one?!			"

Product received for free
												This is one of the worst survival games I have ever played and on top it's one of the worst games I've played ever.Infestation: Survivor Stories has a long history. It first was known as War Z a game which was infamous for steam users where the developers lied about a bunch of the games features and it actually caused Valve to remove the game from the store. Then World War Z caused the game to be renamed to Infestation: Survivor Stories. So you can say that this game had quite a bumpy road, but in the end does it even have any redeeming things about it ?The short answer is no. This game is bad and everything bad you heard about it is pretty much true.So this game is a very close rip off of Day Z. You are spawned into a zombie infested world and you fight to survive. When you meet someone you are given the choice to be a raider or a friendly. But the thing is the game is dead, so when you join a server you either play against 2 people or no one at all. The maps are pretty big so meeting another players before you die is next to impossible. Graphically the game looks abysmal. The range rendering is so bad it makes PS2 games look like anything from this gen. Gameplay wise the game is a survival game so you have to find weapons and find supplies to survive, but fighting zombies is so useless it's better to just avoid combat in general.This game is also really poorly optimised. It crashes constantly and it has massive frame drops when stuff goes down.Also the servers for this version of the game are being shut down, but there's a fan remake of this game again called Infestation, but it also looks identical.In general this game is poorly made, it's buggy, not fun and in general I feel sorry for people who wasted money on this garbage.Pros:N/ACons:- Buggy as hell- Dead community (with the exception of a few players, but it won't matter in a few days)- Absolutely horrible optimisation Final Rating:1/10			"

												I reckon this game could possibly be Satan incarnate. I thought at the sight of the sale 'Oh it's only £1, It'll be funny to pay little for a TOTALLY GREAT game' So I bought it and for the first twenty minutes it physically would not launch. But I persisted, I installed the game after a TOTALLY SHORT amount of time and began to play...Wait - wait no that didn't happen. I didn't play. I spent another REALLY SHORT amount of time installing the game again and then it finally launched. I just had enough time to play the game for about 30 minutes and submit this review before I clawed my eyes out and shot myself in the face with a 12 gauge Double Barreled shotgun, WHICH ACCORDING TO THIS GAME ONLY HAS ONE BULLET. Get DayZ. DayZ won't give you mental Herpes. All in all honesty I think Hammerpoint should pay you to install the game.			"

												My grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, ""If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately."". Tears appeared in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family throught what yuor grandfather put us through."" I agreed. Until this very day, I have never touched a cigarettee. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anywaysaka filled with cheating ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories Classic, formerly Infestation: Survivor Stories, formerly The War Z is a total joke. I really regret buying this game. I fell for the hype of this game when it was first released as The War Z, often called one of the worst games ever. The game promised many things and failed to deliver upon them.One major promise they broke was the multiple worlds or maps. As far as I know there are two right now, the second map took at least a year to finish after the games release. The map was also completely broken and suffered from major performance problems. The War Z (as it was originally named) runs terribly. The game is not optimized and is very laggy. I recently tried playing this game and my antivirus marked it as a threat.This game is also plagued with cheaters and hackers. You will be killed many times by the hundreds of people who cheat in this game. You’re not going to have a good time with this game. The game is full of micro transactions and anything you buy with real money is going to be lost and stolen by cheaters. Say goodbye to your money.Seriously stay away from this game. I would never recommend anyone buy it. I only clocked 22 hours in it to try and get my money’s worth. Every minute was awful.			"

												I really didnt want to write this. I gave this game a second chance, i just tried to log in, mistyped my password 2 times and got banned for 1 hour? So here i come. It's a bit late for this review but... Nevermind.I still cannot believe that i was so hyped for this game. Me and my friends bought this♥♥♥♥♥♥for playing together.  We wanted to have fun. WRONG! Everything went wrong. First of all, for the creators of this game, nice job, really ♥♥♥♥ing nice. THEY PROMISED FOR LOTS OF THINGS AND NONE CAME TO REALITY! I started playing this game when it was still in Alpha. I bought the second package for it. The game wasnt so bad in the first days. Except the ghost zombie bug, that was awful. Me and 4 friends of mine were searching for supplies and weapons for days. What? WOW WE FOUND A SHOTGUN!!! But the game creators didnt want us to have some ammo.  Oh, now we are starving? Doesnt matter, we will just go and die slowly. Alright enough with the Alpha and Beta ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.And the game was released. I wanted do try this game again. I entered the game and... Nothing changed? Oh okay, let me wander a little bit and BAM, a big hole in my head. This is normal.Months later me and my friends wanted to play this again. We found a low populated server and joined it. We found some equipment and wanted to wander together. Somehow everyone left the server. There were 2 people in the server except us. And what happened? When we were raiding the city, someguy flied near us, and ""quickscoped"" everyone in 2 seconds. Well flying + killing 4 people in 2 seconds, totally not a cheater.Anyway, dont buy it,  Steam has enough mercy to give this game 20/100I would give didiwritethisreviewforthis♥♥♥♥♥♥game/100Edit 1 : It seems my account is hacked by a Russian IP. Have fun mate, i won't try to get it back.Edit 2 : Servers are shutting down, thank the maker, we are saved from this cancer.			"

												You know, at first. This really isn't a bad game. But once you spend 50+ dollars trying too support the game and help development you get banned for NO REASON. I was banned twice. The first time we wroked things out and I was back to playing the game, then they banned me a second time. I sent a ticket in and waited for a response.... 2 months later I finally recieve a response, they say they have proof of hacking on my account but they cannot provide it... I even gave them permission too search my computer for any hacks. It's sad really, the moderators and admins they PAY don't do their job on the forum, which is why I spent THREE HOURS A DAY helping people with bug fixes, unlike the ""Professional"" Admin and mod team. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless you want to be backstabbed by hammerpoint.			"

I play pure ""survival"" open world games such as, DayZ Standalone, Arma 3 Epco Mod. 7 days to die, and so on. this game is uncompairable to any other survival FPS out there. this worthless so called ""game"" is nothing but a meer Call of Duty with food and hydration factors. I absolutley 110% do not reccomend this game to anyone of any gaming style.			"

												I bought this game for the 50 dollars or whatever it was when it first came out and everyone ♥♥♥♥♥ed about how it was a ripoff of Day-Z. I first thought it was pretty fun; the concepts were cool, and so was the environment - albeit the game was still mostly under construction back then. I didn't play the game for about a year and just decided to do so now. Nothing has changed except the main screen. New maps? No. The same good old ""Colorado"".New weapons? Not really.Vehicles, or anything like that? Yeah, no.Ability to actually find a player and not run around by yourself the whole game like in Arma 3? Nope.New zombies? Nope.Ability to go into more buildings? Nope.Should you buy this game? Nope.I also have a Velocity Micro gaming PC, and even when running the game on Ultra uber graphics mode it still doesn't even come close to the graphics shown in the Steam preview pics. My guess is they are touched up lies.I'm actually pretty offended that I bought it for 50 dollars and now its only 5 dollars. I want my 45 dollar refund damn it. It's my money and I want it now.			"

I dislike the combat and the vehicles and the maps. The only thing I like about this game is the safezones but you can get that in DayZ Epoch or Overpoch.

												Ok, i am going to offer and honest view in this review and make sure everyone is completley aware of the positives and negatives. Firstly, i think the game is amazing, fun to play and the best of its kind out at the moment. Gameplay is awesome, the shere anxiety you fell in sintuations as amazing. There is nothing like it. Picture this:You are approaching a town through a grassy forest at night. You can hear an owl from the tree above and lonelyness sets in. All you have is your flashlight and a few scraps of food. You are wounded and bleeding from a previous encounter with an infected and need to scavange a bandage as fast as you can or you are going to bleed to death. In the near distance, you can see the small town. The moonlight shimmers a slight reflection on the town roads allowing you to barely make out dark figures scattered around. You notice an ambulance led on its side. An aftermath caused by the sudden panic upon outbreak. You move toward it steadily, checking your surroundings for threats. Suddenly ahead of you, a flash of light and the sound of a gunshot follows. You hit the deck, concealed by the long grass listening, wondering if that shot was meant for you. HOWEVER, yes, i know. My reccomendation is a NO. This is why. When the game was released it was released titled WARZ and during the early stages, there were no anti-cheat software. Bearing in mind that you could BUY items from the in game store for REAL MONEY. Anyone who bought items with their hard earned cash was quickly robbed of it buy cheaters. At one point i read that there was a FREE cheat software available for the game. IU liked the site in the forum to the developers. Nothing came of it. Cheaters accounts were banned. So all that they had to do to play again was buy the game, create a new account and they were back on their way to stealing items. The devs could have issued an IP ban, but that has never happened.  Constant crash issues, files miraculousy go missing. PB failiures, random kicks from PB communication errors. DEVS are money grabbers, There was once a time when loot was fairly balanced, fair ammount of guns/backpacks/meds etc. Before the trading was available, they severly nerfed the loot spawns, forcing players to spend money in their store. A lot of items in the store were only available for purchase with GC (in game money purchased with real money). So the more you spent the more you won (unless a hacker got you first) This game has been avaiable a very long time. And only recently have they added vehicles. again, i kept crashing at one point upon entry. There is 1 map and 1 map only. the new map has been in development for 6 months. You can play in a PTE. The map has a city and 4 TINY towns. The rest of the gigantic map is baron lands which has no actual use.THis is only a tiny portion of why you should NEVER buy this game. I could write PAGES and PAGES of negatives. In a nutshell, if this game was ran by devs who actually gave a crap about the community and were not trying to bleed them dry i would have been one of the best games of all time. Shame on you DEVS. You facked it up. Good on you "

												This game doesn't even work...Well, it didn't for me. When I ran it, it tried 'updating' and crashed repeatedly in the process, blaming my firewall for the deed. I turned my firewall off and tried again and the same thing happened...I looked up the error and the bottom line is that if you get this error, you're far passed ♥♥♥♥ed. But there were a few tutorials on youtube that should help fix it, sadly, none of them did.I bought this game to review on my youtube channel, I was hoping to get a laugh out of it's ineptitude but it couldn't even give me that. This leads me to the conclusion that is the most worthless product in human existence, it's a con, not only should it be free but you should be paid to have it installed on your computer.It's an ungodly abomination that begs for apocalypse and you can't even get a cheap laugh out of it. Bottom line, I wouldn't even recommend buying this garbage for a bit of superficial fun, it's just♥♥♥♥♥♥After reading this review, just go to another game on the store page. You'd be better off buying Kane and Lynch than this garbage.Yes, I said that.(Edit: The only way that I could get the MINIMUM 5 minutes needed to write a review for this game was to cheat by leaving an error message up whilst the game was running.Top quality game this is, couldn't even get 5 minutes out of it!)

												DO NOT BUY!, its so bad.... and they banned people without any reason... they should be kick out of Steam and refund everyone.... if you dont believe me, you can search it on the internet… if you look on Youtube you can see a lot of users that get banned without a reason, and the cherry on the ice-cream... this game is a “pay-2-win” kind of game… so take my advice, pass on this game…BTW all those awesome pictures are NOT from this game...My score: 1/10			"

												i have to say i am really disapointed with this game especialy after thier false advertsing, lies and once i found out that this game is almost completly made from a game made by the same company that makes this game called war inc. The company has changed its name to hammerpoint interactive effectivley selling the same game just rebranded. Bearley any of thier selling points for this game have been implmented (this was realeased as fully complete game almost two years ago) and the ones that have garbage, broken and down right awful, To anyone who things about buying this game i suggest you dont if you do you will most likely regret it			"

												This game is probably the worst and most frustrating game I have ever played. It has so many problems, hackers end your fun and take your hard earned gear. I have a graphics card that can run high detailed games fine, but the graphics on this game are so terrible and can cause FPS issues. What really makes me dislike the game is that players can simply buy their way into surviving and have all this gear they never even found. But no, it gets worse. Ammo is appearently very rare in the game, being 3x harder to find than actual guns! The guns seem to deal low damage to both zombies and players, which in this case, need more ammo. Where can you get this ammo? You can get it via purchase. I didn't realize that it takes 3 shots with a shotgun to kill a SINGLE zombie. The delevopers pretty much made the guns weak so that they would need more ammo, more ammo that people have to buy in order to get enough to for 1 emergency. This game has an endless amount of problems and issues that im not going to get started on. The only thing I like about this game is how the loot is placed around the map (hat on a dresser, gun in a gun rack, etc.) and more of the buildings are enterable. But aside from only 2 things I thought was well done, I don't recommend this game. I recommend titles such as DayZ, Rust, and State of Decay if your looking for a good zombie apocolyptic survival game.			"

I can't play the game unless I give more money. more than I already paid. :/Maybe it should be listed honestly.  I realy feel like I was lied to and bought an absolute lemon.

												This is a great example of what could have been. Post apocalyptic zombie survival mmo sounds hard to mess up but nearly every one does and this game takes the cake and eats the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it. When first released on steam as War It had pictures of the game looking fun, playable, and looking polished with features. Sadly they were all fake all these features were not even included and still are not. They stole pictures and loading screens from other games and was forced to take them down along with the whole game its self for awhile on steam. It doesn't stop there the developers made acounts went in game and banned people talking♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game. About the only thing worse then the developers is the actual community its self. Camping outside one of the 3 safe zones with wepons killing new players that only have flashlights for no reason. I guess I should mention the gameplay as well. Gun combat is shakey, inaccurate, and almost useless unless you have a scope. Most of you would be lucky to even get far enough to find a gun. Cause once you get killed by an other player for no reason you get to waitover an hour of real life to respawn! That is unless you pay to them real life money to respawn faster of course!. Melee combat is almost useless as hits do not register. Most items are locked behind a pay 2 win wall. I could go on for hours about just my horror stories in this game. Maybe I will write more just to keep you from buying this game from these greedy lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Final Score3/10			"

												Honestly this is the worst zombie MMO I have played. At first it looked very interesting, but it was just a terrible copy of DayZ and other similar games. I'm quite sure there was a reason this game was about 1$ during a Steam sale, and yet even though it was only a dollar I still wish to refund it. When I first bought the game, downloaded it, then played it, I was suddenly thrown into the main menu having no idea what to do. There is no tutorial whatsoever, and you're not going to recieve any help from other players. When I first entered a server I spawned right next to a man with an AK-47. Instantly I tried to ask for some assistance and tips. Same goes for all the other servers. It's always shoot first then talk for some reason. This game is certainly not friendly to new players, nor is the community very friendly either. To finish off, I HIGHLY dislike this game and hope that no one else will buy it.			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories (aka The WarZ) got a lot of bugs / crashes / lags / random disconnection which could be really annoying and in most of the cases your character dies because of that and you lose all the items you had on it.In my opinion, Infestation: Survivor Stories can be fun when you get into the game and play without having disconnection , but in its current statement , the game is just not playable and even though I played around 57 hours , I could say a large part from that was in the joinning screen for like ten minutes and after that to see your player for a second , and after that you just return to the lobby with the well known message ""Disconnected from server"" ,When I bought the game I did have like a month where I did have like disconnection in a day which was fine , but now I can't even play the game. I've tried all the things I could try , updating PunkBuster , reinstalling the game and so on , but nothing worked.In conclustion , DO NOT buy this game right now , wait for the developers to fix the game first , if you want to try this game , go ahead and play the trial , and if the game goes on 75% off , and you really enjoyed the trial , you can consider buying the full game because if the game works fine for you , 3.74$ is nice price for hours of fun.But again , this game can work fine for you and suddenly you couldn't join servers anymore , so think carefully before buying this game.Final score : 4/10 After they will fix the crashes / disconnections / annoying drop fps , I'll rate this game 9/10 , because I had a lot of fun playing it with my friends while I could			"

												Honestly I played this game for a long time, and for many hours a day, and while I can honestly say I enjoyed playing it for a while, my final conclusion is that this genre of gaming is the next big thing in MMO, and this idea for a game is fantastic.That being said this particular game is a case of what could potentially be an absolutely outstanding game, being held back by it's lazy and carefree developers. The game as you will find is riddled with glitches, bugs, poor balancing issues, and not to mention least of all hackers.Know in any other gamers hackers a real nuisciance but in this there level of annoyance and anger they inflict upon you is so much worse, because you loose all your hard earned guns and items and have to just start from scratch yet again and after being killed 15 times in a row from 500 + metres by an aimbot the game becomes infuiriating. All I can say is I hope a game along this genre line is launched soon that is properly handled and produced by the developers.			"

												Infestaion Survivor Stories tries to capture the new Zombie MMO genre but fails due to many flaws with the game. The most notable flaw is the microtransactions which takes away the whole ""survival"" from the game knowing that you can buy food and medical supplies that does give an unfair advantage to players who chose not to pay for virtual items, You also have to pay to revive your characters Now this wouldn't really be a problem if it were a free to play game but its not it's £11 waste of money.Another problem with the game are the bugs and they can be game breaking, Zombies can seem to hit you when they are not very close to you and it doesn't take long for them to kill you. If you try to stand on hard to reach places the zombies sometimes stack on each other and can eventually hit you.A big flaw in the game is how the zombies match your running speed, This matched with the fact you walk slower the more damaged you are, But the zombies seem to keep jogging on so it becomes very hard to outrun them this matched with their hit range makes the game too hard and almost unplayable.All this negativity doesn't mean the game doesn't have some positve atributes, One thing I liked was the time capsule feature   which allowed players to write a message in a tube can leave it for other players to find so this added ""Role playing"" if you're into that. Also you cannot buy guns on the store which doesn't make it purely pay to winThe game still is in alpha so this could all change but it's has not had any major updates since release which makes me think the developers have abandoned the game.

												I would not recommend this game to ANYBODY. Its full of glitches, God  KNOWS its full of hackers galore (like a rediculous amount), the gameplay is meh, and on top of all the game was an over-hyped cash grab.  I bought this game a little length of time after its release on Steam and put MORE than enough hours into this piece o'♥♥♥♥♥♥game to know what it is. They constantly ban anyone on their forums who even remotely calls them out on ANYTHING theyre doing wrong (me included) and random bans in game for people because of a terrible anti-hack system. I even had a *brief* conversation with a mod who had said how much he hates his job and all he sees when he goes on the forums was ""negativity and despair""....Great mod crew theyve got there to accompany their less-than-medeocre developing team.2/10 would not bang.p.s. Kewk is gone? 1 step in the right direction but it wont ever save this game..			"

												I tried really hard to like this game and it was fun at first playing with several friends (there were 9 of us...we've all quit). However, as many others have stated...... cheaters, p2w, broken promises, expensive servers, preferencial treatments, dumb♥♥♥♥♥changes, bugs, performance issues and waiting for updates / features to bring it to level of awesomeness everyone was expecting. This is the biggest let down I've ever experienced from a video game. (Including waiting FIFTEEN YEARS for Duke Nukem Forever just for it to be the garbage that it is). Buy Something else....anything else....this game is the equivalent of paying $15 for a turd.....then having to engage in a microtransaction \ expensive rental for something to block the smell. I wish I could remove it from my library completely.			"

												The game itself I've heard very bad things about, and even didn't realize it was WarZ just renamed. The controls are choppy and the damage you can do vs the zombiesis disheartening. However gameplay problems aside thats not the reason why I don't recomend this game, its the customer support and the way they deal with players. Given that games through steam, especially ones that require an account, can't be changed once initialy set. This makes it impossible to play the game if anything happens.  If you look on my record, you can see that I have barely any time on this game, that is due to the way the game works. If you die, theres a 24 hour cooldown before you can play again. Its fine I'll play a little bit, and if I die turn the game off. After getting the 7 or so hours of total play time, I was tired of playing. I uninstalled it and went on to play other games. Months later, I see the new update and decide to play it again to see if anything was made better. And to my surprise I find that my account is banned. Why was it banned? I haven't played the game at all. I decide to contact customer support about the problem, perhaps they can shed some light on what happened or what they mistakenly think happened in game. January 10th was when I sent them a support ticket to repeal the ban, they only just got back to me today saying there was detected uses of exploits or programs to basically cheat the game. And that because this so called detection was against their agreement they won't unban the account. Now remember I haven't played the game at all in this entire time they say something happened. So how could I have suposedly done any of this? Their answer? ""We are unable to provide any further detail regarding the results of our investigations due to its sensitive nature."" So the information about my account is sensitive and unable to be shared with me, the account owner. They won't overturn the decision cuz it aparently is against their terms even if it may be their mistake in the first place, and I can't make a new account cuz its perminately tied with steam, making it a useless game stuck in my library. I can deal with crappy gameplay mechanics and annoying texture glitches and such. I can deal with boring gameplay and whatnot. I can ignore all that, but when a company doesn't want to help its players in their own game. That is where I draw the line, and this is the reason why I do not ever recomend this game or any of their future products.			"

If you buy this, you DESERVE all the bad things this game will bring to you.I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, even to my worst enemy. I wouldn't recommend this game to Lucifer in person.[/b] - Last words from Hater Guy, after being shot by hackers aimbotters at market entrance. Infestation: Hacker Stories is the WORST game I've ever played in my entire life. I tried, I tried sooo freaking hard to like this game, alone, with friends, 2, 3, 10 friends, 100 times!!!. It was a 50 dollar investment back then, but I never had fun with this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ EVER. This game is worst than E.T from Atari. It should be buried deep down in the desert along with this shameful companyI've been playing videogames since I was 7, I'm 27 now. I've played more than 3000 titles so far and THIS, this very game is an example to not be followed - either by its flawed design or by its company and developers. I regret the day when I bought this piece of trash at pre-alpha, when it still called ""WarZ"", before being legally forced to change its name due copyright infringement from World War Z movie. The community on this game is sick, the developers sucks, game itself sucks hard. Full of bugs, glitches, hacks and absent staffers that wouldn't give you a ♥♥♥♥ even if your life depended on it. No to mention all the random banhammer rage who banned innocent people and leave hackers unpunished. Months ago, it got worse. There was a data corruption or something on their forums and servers and the guys showed us that they simply couldn't handle it. All data erased and, again, no one give us a single ♥♥♥♥ to make it better. I wouldn't trust my credit card information to these leechers again! I wouldn't do if I were you.The only reason for this game have been released was the huge zombie hype brought by The Walking Dead and World War Z. I wish I could delete this game from my list.WAR Z WORLD WAR Z INFESTATION FEATURES:- Laughable IA- More hackers per m² than Crossfire, Combat Arms and similar  games- GMs who don't give a dame.- TONS of microtransations. It's a pay-to-win out there, fellows.- Hacks!- Delayed updates, delayed fixed, delayed maps, delayed everything.- No respect for you, customer, at all. I mean, REALLY, visit their forums and check it out.- No security for your billing information.- Get T-bagged all day long, by hackers, by zombies, by GMs, by life.Want a better survival horror game?Day Z on the way. I didn't played the new standalone yet, but the Arma 2 mod gave me SO MUCH more fun than Infestation could ever possibly give.			"

												War Z, or Infestation: Survivor Stories as it has been forcibly renamed (not the devs fault but the new name just isn't catchy), had the potential to be an excellent survival game, it just needed a few major issues such as its cheat protection and banning system ironed out. However, the developers made a mess of it, instead focusing on adding more and more content and complicating things by constantly changing loot spawning rates and postions, making it impossible to actually set up with a group of friends in one location. By failing to address the needs and requests of the community, they allowed this game to flop and become a sore point for any self-respecting survival player. Anyone looking to purchase a survival game, avoid this one, if you're set on a zombie survival game get Day-Z or, for an interesting twist, Nether, though as for the latter there is again the worry that it could also follow the same path as ISS did.EDIT 19/06/2016Do not fall for the new developing Infestation World game currently underway, a huge number of previous ISS players who cheated in ISS, have already moved over to IW and continued cheating, the GC redemption that has been offered is, frankly, a joke, and a pathetic attempt at buying previous players, who will be thoroughly dissappointed, as you will only recieve compensation for GC present in your account currently, and only if purchased within the last year or so. If you're going to remake an already bad game, nearly just as badly, don't then also be utter cheapskates to not transfer more GC that plyers have purchased. I know players who (albeit foolishly) have bought at least 40,000 GC, and yet are only compensated with a trivial 1000 or even less since that's all they currently have in their ISS accounts.

												For the love of god, dont buy this game. Its terrible and now people is getting banned left and right for no reason.The game is full of glitches, awfull gameplay, non rewarding, non entertaining. Just read the forums and critics all over the web, plus now they are just plainly robbing people by banning users claiming they have detected 3rd party programs therefore breaking eula, and that i am sure its a scam to force people into buying more copies of that worthless game.I bought it just because a friend talked me into it. Just Dont Buy It			"

												NO! My friend and I bought this game thinking it would be awesome, but afterwards regretting it after dying every 5 seconds when we spawn. It is a horribly made game, with no chance of survival. If you come across another player, you are most likely screwed. There is no way to run like in DayZ, becasue the gun accuracy is too far. The game is buggy and crashes alot. It seems almost unfinished. DONT BUY IT!!!..... Oh, did I forget? YOU HAVE TO PAY TO RESPAWN!!! so good look waiting that hour after dying!			"

												Trash. Plain and simple. I have stuck with this game since the beginning but was not fortunate enough to own Arma 2 to be able to play the wonderful Day Z.The previously known as ""War Z"" was promising at the start but eventually proved to lead no where.. Don't be fooled by the polished ""screenshots"" of gameplay. This game mays as well be an out right scam.. They refuse to focus on any of the major problems with the game and instead focus on completely cosmetic aspects of it..Play this game and you're going to be doomed to wasting buckets of cash on their cash shop.They deserve the meta score of 20.. I'd give them even lower than that.			"

												I wouldn't wish this game on my worst enemy. It's terribly optimised, incredibly buggy, and was made solely to rip people off. It was removed from Steam twice and had to be renamed to avoid being associated with itself(it was formerly known as ""The War Z""). I'm glad I didn't waste my money on this, I was given it by a friend who wasn't aware of what the developers were doing and how bad the game was. If I had to choose between playing this game and watching Birdemic, I'd watch Birdemic. Both movies. Please do yourself a favour and don't get this game.			"

												Before I say how horrible this game is, let me provide the source of my anger in this game. I decided to go into a zombie infested military base in hopes of finding at the very least a pistol. I had plenty of ammunition. Without realizing it, I spent 2 hours searching that enitre base, hacking my way through an endless amount of zombies, with way too many close calls only to realize that there is no gun in that base. Of all places to find a gun, you would think a military base would have it. But nope. I even searched Police stations, nothing. Now to stop myself from rambeling, I am just going to list what is wrong with this game.-Zombies run like they have some sort of strange disease that doesn't just bring them back to life.-Guns are almost impossible to find, yet some people have them by what seems to be a miracle.-You cannot trust anyone, if you group with someone you can expect 9 times out of 10, they will kill you.- You will spend hours just searching ONE military base, thankfully I called it quits after realizing I had just spent 2 hours.- Animation horrible- Server Crashes- the ressurection system is unfair- insufficient customization options- lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag lag oh did i mention? LAG- NOT EVEN A DEAD ZOMBIE SOLDIER HAD A DAMN PISTOL- ammo everywhere, no gun in sight.- you lose everything when you die.... including the points you just bought with REAL money.- Flare gun..... What is the point if everyone is going to kill you.- There needs to be a better friend/foe system.- Better travel system needed- It is the 21st century in this game SOMEONE HAS TO HAVE A DAMN GUN.My Rant is over.....

												I wouldn't recommend to play this game to be honest. It's not a Zombie Survival game! It's more a Bug survival game. Zombies get bugged, could hit you through walls, so called ""phantom hits"" from the said Zombies can screw up an entire hour of searching for good stuff, IF YOU DON'T GET SHOT by one of those players who pay for this pile of bugs. To be honest if you enter a 5/100 populated server, you can be almost 90-100% sure that you get shot. It doesn't matter if its a PvE server.If there would be an option for PvE servers to turn the PvP hitbox COMPLETLY off it would be better. Otherwise I would never recommend this game to any of my friends or strangers who ask me about this game.			"

												Usually when I see a low score and there's a lot of people trashing a game, I try to give it the benefit of the doubt until I've played it for myself.

I thought ""This is a zombie survival game, how can it be bad?"" - This may very well be the worst game on Steam, and I'd go as far to say this is probably the worst game I've ever played.The list of things that were good about this game is GREATLY shorter than the list of♥♥♥♥♥♥that is ♥♥♥♥ed up.

												This game has horrible textures. The walking animation is very basic and the map is very buggy. You can't even swim in the river ; it's just an invisible wall. There are some terrains that are so buggy that will randomly kill you due to ""fall damage."" It is essentially a pay-to-win game since one can buy weapons and food to get a better advantage. The whole concept of survival and working with other people does not exist since everyone will most likely shoot you on sight without a warning. It is only decently good if you have friends to play with but it is still a horrible experience.			"

												Bugs Galore. Game crashes constantly. When game crashes it tells you that you commited suicide and you loose all your stuff.Getting into vehicles causes disconnect from the game.Hell, just walking down the road causes you to disconnect. I think its about time Steam stepped in and looked at these posts,  98% of them are WARNING people not to buy this game.........Coincidence ? I think not !!!I wonder if Steam realizes that people over at Infestation are taking advantage of Steam customers by introducing a pay to play game that isnt even worthy to be caled a beta game.So in closing, this is my message to the Steam/Valve Corporation,  I think the masses have spoken and its time to take action on your end and put the Infestation developers on notice.

												I won’t go into detail about the bad gameplay animation, the textures or the horrible player interaction that most people tend to talk about in this renamed pile of something that makes even worst crap look as clean as a new polished mirror. It’s really how the trading system works that bothers me even after taking my £13.00 purchasing the game it dares have the option to put more money if I wanted better starting item’s  to only have the possibility of losing them if I die, I could understand if the item’s stayed in there storage permanently like an infinite number since access to them is only available in traders or when creating a new character, but because it doesn’t it’s like taking a gamble with no real payoff (put it simply an actual real waste of money).There’s also the fact you can’t sell off any of the loot you find like weapons or armour meaning the only way to get in game currency is to just continuously kill zombies which leads to endless grinding due to it being fairly rare that they drop only 10-50 dollars.If anything I’m the Idiot for buying this, I don’t know why I didn’t take the advice from half the reviews demoting this low rated game.

												The producer of Big Rigs Sergey Titov, also made this beauty, WarZ... I mean, Infestion: Survivor Stories... Wait, Infestion: Survivor Stories ""Classic"" ... From my knowledge this game was awful all the way through, along with all of the other projects Titov has produced. Their whole forums die, have robots and use their own staff to reply to their own threads, no support, change the prices of their games consistently, Steam wouldn't allow me to remove it from my games list after being unfairly banned and no support forums.I hated this game to begin with but really tried to give it a chance, it was more of a sandbox with hackers, endless unpatched exploits to gain easy gear, noclip zombies, terrible animations, then added pay-to-win features such as quicker revival time [limted time to play a day if you died too much, to player slots and gear slots, etc. Oh and did I mention their own ""anti-cheat"" before they used FairFight, was used to monitor your screen while you played, yeah, totally not fishy at all...I haven't installed this game in years, never was going to re-install either, but I laugh as I see the game hasn't been removed from steam, and do enjoy reading the endless comments. Do no bother playing any of these games, as if you do some background checks, the same thing happens with most, if not all of his unsuccessful games, did I say games? I meant demos... Over priced demos...Oh yes before I pulbish I see a ""Shattered Skies"" promo underneath, took a quick glance, wouldn't bother buying that either. It's an ARMA clone with the same engine used in this abandonware.			"

												Don't buy this ""Game"", you will regret throwing your money away to some lying and generally shady Dev's. The game is also full of bugs and Hacker, and the price to rent a Private server for a month is outrageous high. Don't expect to get far when playing on a public server, because everyone just shoots everyone when they have a gun. You will have more from your money if you buy something else than this mess of code called a ""Game"".			"

												WarZ, otherwise known as ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" was by far the most catastrophic failure of a game released in 2012. It's one of the lowest scoring games in the history of Metacritic.com with a 20/100 critic score and a 1.7 of 10 user score. These scores don't lie, it really is as bad as people say it is. Extremely bad optimization, resource hogging, horrible texture's & distance lod, terrible animations, glitchy mechanics, and broken weapons. This game is the single worst purchase I've ever made on Steam, and I even bought it during a sale.The game was marketed using entirely misrepresenting screenshots, it's a wonder that it hasn't entirely been pulled from Steam.

												Long time i dont touch this game, and i know there have been plenty of updates, but its really hard to say something positive about this title. By the time i played with my friends,in 2013, the game had already been oficially launched, and it was a buggy mess. It was sad. The gameplay was incredible boring, the graphics were unfinished, the amount of bugs we found in just a little time playing were huge. And also, a lot of microtransitions. Terrible game, i hope the developers are working hard to fix this, people are telling me that this game is still broken. And this change of name(the game was called War Z before, if im not wrong) was also sad. Infestation - Survivor Stories.....lol, that's a bad name, sorry. It should be Bugstation - Disappointing Stories			"

												First, a warning: The developers of this game will bend you over and f*ck you, hard and deep. They are the worst kind of scumbags on the internet.Originally titled The War Z, Infestation: Survivor Stories has some very innovative perspectives on survival FPS's. Akin to DayZ, it's vast open world full of zombies and loot allow for hours of gameplay. But, unlike DayZ I:SS offers a unique EXP system and persistent inventory comparable to the stash system from Diablo or PoE. But all of this is for naught, as the EXP is just that, an accumulation of EXP with nothing to spend it on, and the persistant inventory/stash would be GREAT, if not for the horrible lacking of items to find and the Pay to Win MTM.The game intentionally tries to make you less than self sufficient, forcing you to either buy from the MTM, starve to death, die of Dehydration, or have almost no ammo, ever. Guns are also scarce beyond everything you'd ever imagine. If you find a shotgun, good luck finding ammo for it, and STANAG's are more rare than Sniper Rifles.So be warned, this game is full of empty promises, corruption, and greed.Update: I returned to this game after an 8 month hiatus, and alot has been fixed. Many of the stability issues have been fixed, the spawn rate of items is acceptable (but certainly not lucrative), the skill tree has finally been implemented, vehicles have been added and missions have improved the rate in which you accumulate in-game currency you can spend at settlements. Also, the in game currency feels much more reasonable to spend to get items.Update 12/14/14: This game has inherent flaws in the combat mechanics, there's a massive hole in the anti-cheat system making the game vulnerable to cheaters, the spawn system could use some improvement, and stability issues plague this game. The recent patch has really done a service to this game by removing the revive timer. All in all, though I:SS can be fun to play, it's still not a game I'd recommend.TL;DR (12/14/14): NOT RECOMMENDED			"

												Contrary to what many others have said, I confirm that you can still indeed login to Infestation, and that its various official servers are still online. I'm not sure why people are saying they're down. I just tested this myself and was playing on their US servers with no issues, and there were at least 12 of them online. As terrible as the game became (what a waste, considering it had so much potential), I just want to make it clear to everyone that their servers are still online.Still though, no way I'd recommend this game ever since they dropped the ball on it in late 2013.

												do not even consider buying this game if you do not have half a dozen reliable players on a private chat to play with you because you will get absolutely nothing but grief from this game if you don't.if there are four or five players on a server coordinating their efforts in a private voice chat, you will never make a move on that server without being shot down or gang♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ these games are nothing but the lowest form of online predators, basically games like this breed the equivalent of online street gangs waiting for the opportunity to mug people in a dark alley.a single player in this game will have absolutley no fun unless they are admining their own server and that's how they getcha, that is what the publisher relies on to make their money besisdes peoples' natural gullibility and willingness to gamble five dollars because they own all the servers and they rent them for an exorbitant fee! do you see how that works?if you are a person who took the advertisement at face value and only bought the game with the belief that it was a real game and didn't have intentions of renting your own server or being an online thug in a virtual street gang then you will be nothing but cannon fodder for the people who did do one or the other or both of those two things.now you know the truth, this game, most definitely, is a scam! don't throw five bucks away! it may not seem like much but it's still money and it's still makes the publisher/developer a.k.a. scammers wealthy men while you lose money and recieve nothing but anal daterape in return for it.

												This is literally the worst ****ing game you'll ever play. I've never loved and hated a game so much in my entire life. It's a pay to win game which is BS. The bugs are endless in this game and have ****ed me over more times then I can count. The hackers are ridiculous... everywhere... **** AIMBOT! This game is basically robbing you of your money for **** coding. This game has so much potential if the makers didnt SUCK ****! tThey have made little to no progression what so ever since I purchased this game at least over a year ago. SO DON'T FOR THE LOVE OF GOD GIVE THESE ****ERS YOUR MONEY!!!			"

												So I decided to make a review for Infestation: Survivor Stories after I opened up the game for the first time in a week and got a message that said ""You have been banned permanetly by fairfight"". Now I dont remember me hacking or anything but I do remember right now that im about to give a horrible review for this copy of ""war inc""♥♥♥♥♥♥ I guess they could tell the future to know that I am about to write a long, honest review. And believe, to the devs, HONEST isn't the word they're looking for about this game.So where do I start? Well I will just start from the beginning.So here I am loading into the world of colorado for the first time. My DayZ expectations up and my Call Of Duty expectations down to the minimum but let me tell you....I should have flipped those two around. I ran for 10 minutes until I met this little base. I checked my map and it said...""Norad Military Base"". So I ran in there and I saw a zombie. I had courage with my flashlight gripped in my hand and immedatly walked towards the zombie...All of the sudden I heard ♥♥♥♥♥♥ audio moaning from all directions. I sprinted down into the middle of the base and then I heard a huge BANG...""You are dead"" it said as it played sad music. That wasn't the first time I got shot out of the blue at will NEVER be its last. After 100 hours of pain and suffering I got a good inventory. I found a clan and we PvP'd all day. We got loads of loot..LOADS OF IT. But then later something stranged happened....at blue ridge safe zone I saw 2 guys doing something with guns. There were only 10 people on the server including me so I ran to get closer and they looked like they were dooping snipers. At first I though that was dumb and stupid but I look now at it and see that hacking was everywhere. 80% off all infestation players are Hackers. So the zombie AI is rigged, no player is friendly, frame rate sucks, guns suck, hacker's always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥new spawns, constant kicking by fairfight, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dev's like Artimes Knives. What else......Oh yeah...Everything you see in the screenshot's of this game on steam store is false. They also bring you in to spend alot of money on ingame GC. So never and I say NEVER reach for your wallet for this♥♥♥♥♥♥game.Looks like this is the end of my review...I let I:SS off easy on this one.....Thanks for reading...DONT GET GAME			"

												Usually, the Metascore of a game isn't accurate. I can say the same for this time aswell.The fact that this game has a 20 in the Metascore is giving the developers too much credit.This game was not even remotely worth the $1.49 it was on sale for. They should pay YOU to play this game. This game is garbage and a half. I would get into more detail, but after 30 minutes of this game, I can tell you that the AI might aswell had been by the developers of Big Rigs. The only reason this game was ever scraped together from Hammerpoint Interactive was to vampire off of the success of DayZ, and they did perfectly at just that. They made their game War Inc, except with different models and added zombies, they couldn't even make their own ToS. They deliberately took League of Legend's ToS and made it their own, just finding and replacing Riot's name to their own. The only thing this game and the developers did well, was steal the money of zombie game enthusiasts and bite the hand that feeds these low-life cretins.The load times and the amount of cheaters on the game are nothing compared to any other game I've played, including World at War on console.

												メタスコアがまさかの数値を叩き出していますが、ゲーム自体はやってることがDayZなのでつまらないものではありません。人によってはDayZというかArmAシリーズのもったりした操作性が嫌いな人もいるので、そういう人ならむしろこっちの方が合うのではないかと。このゲームの評価が低い大きな理由は開発・運営会社が非常にいい加減かつ口八丁なことで、大風呂敷広げておいて結局殆ど実現できていないという点でしょう。またチート対策などもあまり積極的ではない感じで、ゲームが崩壊していることもしばしば。あと単純にゲームのつくりが適当というか急ごしらえな感じがしますね、エンジンが無料ゲームのWar inc.と一緒なのですが殆どのモーションやオブジェクトは使いまわしとなっています。開発・運営面を加味しなかった場合個人的にはメタスコア50以上はあるんじゃないかと思っていたり。			"

												Ok, where to start. After all this hype and everything they promised us about this game ( I´m talking about Warz ) , I got it at release date and well...not even 40% of the content was avaible. Ok so after maaaany hours of gameplay I just couldnt stand it anymore so I stopped playing this game. After few month I saw that they upgraded the graphics and added new features so I wanted to give it a try again. And gues what, I install the game then I enter my profile information to login aaaaaaaanddd........Your account was banned due to susspicious activity....,.....   T_T So I send them an email ofcourse asking about why the ♥♥♥♥ the banned my account I wasnt even playing. And gues what,they didnt even bothered to answer me. I tried this few times and still with the same result.This company and this game is a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The ripped me off and I saw on the internet that I am not the only one. Now they made another game with all the missing features from Infestation: Survivor stories but from what I saw Its EXACLY the same, they only added a new map and they want to make us pay again for that crap. ♥♥♥♥ YOU and good bye			"

												BANS- Bans everywhere. There are a lot of cheaters in this game, and Hammerpoint solves it by handing out bans for the slightest thing. Your account can be banned because you alt+tabbed. My first account was banned just because I was walking through a forest.- If you write a support ticket, you will never be answered. A year has passed since my 1st account was banned and I am still waiting for my tickets to be answered.- If you ask for your money back, they will only agree to give it back by means of a transfer to you bank account in Azerbaijan (which nobody has).- I asked PayPal for a refund and they gave it back instantly, so imagine how much of a scam this is that PayPal knows they have to give you the money without inquiring you further.GRAPHICS- Trailers show you very nice graphics, which you will never see again in-game. They are lying to you.- This game is badly optimised. That means bad graphics but high requirements. I play on an Alienware M17X with minimum specs and I can't go over 40 FPS when staring at the ground. Out in the open with zombies on screen and such it's usually 20 FPS.- There used to be a trick where you could create a .ini file in your game directory so you would disable ambient occlusion, grass movement and other stuff upon launching the game so it would work better, but now Hammerpoint decided to forbid it. If you have a .ini file in your directory you get a ban, yes, a ban for changing your system specs, like wtf.GAMEPLAY- Cheaters everywhere. You will see people flying, aimbots, X-Ray vision, etcetera. This is not too frequent, but it is there.- It is very hard to find loot because people keep looting all the good spots, then they switch servers and loot the same spot again.- Spawncamping. You log in with your fully equipped character and you're shot in the head from behind by a camper. You lost everything. Nice, fair. In some servers you can't even leave the safe zone because there are 20 people with shotguns waiting at the edge to shoot the first guy who steps out of it.- Hammerpoint created an item: the lockbox. With that item you may loot a spot of your choice and put everything in the lockbox, where it will be kept safe forever. So basically Hammerpoint is fostering all these server jumps and looting.- Why? Because they want you to pay for premium servers (with enhanced loot) or rent your own server (where you can play alone) for 50€ a month.- It's pay-to-win. Yes, everything in the store can also be found in-game, but a guy who spent 5€ in mags has unlimited ammo compared to your single STANAG 30 mag. Plus bags to carry more stuff, night vision, protective gear, etc.- People who pay can instantly log back in when they die and recover their stuff, while non-paying players must wait 30 minutes.- Zombies are broken. Let me explain in detail.- Hitting them will interrupt them, so you may stunlock any zombie just by hitting him with your fists at timed intervals. This makes you immortal as long as you have extreme patience and you can pull them one by one.- Zombies always appear to stagger when you hit them, but if you hit 2 zombies, one will hit you back. You will only interrupt one of them. So you may swing your katana through 5 zombies and all of them will fall back, but you will unexplicably get 4 hits on you.- Some zombies have running or jumping animations. In these cases you must spam melee attacks because you don't know where they are. The special buggy animation zombies can be anywhere, not where you see them. You will get hit by those guys at least once most of the time, which is really unfair.OVERALLThe game is entertaining. It's a great idea in the wrong hands. There are online petitions signed by thousands of players asking Hammerpoint to let go of this game and let some real developers manage it, but they won't. So long story short: if you see this game for 2€ Steam offer go ahead and try it, otherwise don't even get close.			"

												I would never recommend paying full price for this game. It's a great time killer, but in order to be great at this game you need to shell out a good $50 to $60 on their ""in game currency"" to buy items and weapons. If you die, you have to wait a full hour before you can play that character again. Also when your character does revive you start out with nothing. This is a poor excuse of a copy cat game I've seen in a very long time.

												I was kicked for no reason 3 times in 1 hour! You dont have a binoculars making it very difficult to distinguish zombies for other players. And you are killed at sight for other players camping in the cities. Ho! almost forget, in this game the zombies run as fast as you, it is impossible to escape runing, and you wil die if anyone note you and you dont have a gun and lots of ammo, any weapon other than a gun is quite useless, it takes several zilion hits to kill a zombie, you have to wait 30 min. to play again if you die, and you die a lot in this game. the worst thing is the lack of cooperation between the players, camping all day in a building waiting for other players to pass, and kill every player for the sake of f@#% the game of someone is not my ideia of fun. separate areas for PvP would solve the problem, but the developers don't demonstrate interest in this ideia, and the game is PAY TO WIN. RUN FROM THIS♥♥♥♥♥♥LIKE YOU ARE RUNNING FROM A ZOMBIE. CRAP GAME. Exist other games ( Good games) to invest your spare time.			"

												I’m not sure of what compelled me to play this game for more than two hundred hours. There are extraordinary amount of problems that linger in the game and have a serious hacker crisis. The developers have done almost nothing to stop the increasing crisis, when hackers rule a game there’s no point playing that game. An old elevator going up seven stories is faster than this games load time, when you get into the game you’re going to run into an FPS problem or just crash. Even today this game feels like complete garbage, don’t get this game and if you’re thinking about gifting it to anyone save your money and get something else.			"

												Alright, I decided to review this after owning it for months now.  I know Steam says I only have roughly 1 hour played on this game, but I originally bought it from their website after it was released.  So, here's my review for 'Infestation: Survivor Stories' (Originally known as 'WarZ'). Performance : Most of my friends on Steam know that I have a superb gaming PC, which I bought for roughly $2,000. It's GPU (graphics processing unit) is amazing, and etc. Despite my PC's specs, I somehow average at roughly 15 frames per second on  low  settings. Did they create the game so it works better for specific graphics cards or something? If they did, that's really idiotic on the developer's part. Graphics : Personally, I don't judge a game by it's graphics... but there are some people out there who do. The game's graphics looks like a game out of 2008, and isn't detailed that well.  Combat & AI: The combat of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' has always given me a huge headache, even when I have a superb weapon. Whether I'm using a combat knife or an axe, I find it taking absolutely  forever  to kill one zombie... while hitting it's head. The combat is really buggy as well, from my experiences playing the game. The AI of the zombies is less than decent as well, but they're zombies... so it's not like they're  supposed  to be smart. Community : The community of the game is fairly nice, although there is one thing to be aware of before buying this game.  Do not trust anyone.  Usually that's the case for most zombie MMO's out there, but there are friendly people... right? Not in 'Infestation: Survival Stories'! Any player I've come across in this game has either killed me or attempted to kill me and died in the process. I'm sure there may be a few people playing a hero here and there, but none that I've come across so far. Another problem of this game is that  alot  of people hack in this game. So, if you're going to fight someone... it may not always be a fair fight. Servers : I personally haven't had many connection issues with the servers in 'Infestation: Survival Stories', but like most game there are a few connections issues here and there.  Although, you should expect to be banned on servers in this game... alot.  Even if you aren't doing anything, you could possibly get banned from the server you're playing on. I've been banned constantly off of servers for hacking when I've done nothing. Is this game 'P2W'? : When people say this game is P2W (pay to win), they are completely right. This game is extremely P2W, as you can buy almost any item from the game with real money, instead of finding it in the game. My overall rating of the game is 4/10.  It has it's moments, but it can be frustrating as all hell.So, this concludes my review of 'Infestation: Survival Stories' ('WarZ'). I hope you found this review helpful, and if you didn't, feel free to comment why! And lastly, thanks for reading my review. =)			"

												O boy where do i start... This game came out as a great idea, but has gone the wrong way. There are jsut way to amny things wrong with it. The team behind the game is not good at all (not bashing them). They keep trying to take the right step and end up messing up the game even further. Spent alot of time playing the game and then they ban me as well, makes no sense. Do not waist your money on this, if you are really interested in this game try the trial account. Another problem with this game is that hackers are every where and never go away. The game feels like it is Call of Duty with zombies roaming around, that have almost no effect on the game play, becaus the zombies are awfull. The survival aspects of his game are not even there, i mean yea you have to eat and drink, but it means nothing. If you really want ot looki ingto a survival zombie game take your time to look at DayZ mod, or wait for DayZ standalone, which i can not wait for looks so amazing.			"

												Did anyone know that for  €14.99 or your equivelant you can get games that work, look better and are more fun? I know it's crazy to think that but it's true.  With that money you can choose from 9000+ games that are actually worth the money and your time.  This on the other hand, is not one of those games.  Save yourself that hard earned cash and spend it just even a little bit more wisely, I was dumb back then and bought this even after hearing all the controversy that surrounds the game.  Please,  DO NOT BUY THIS and DO NOT ACCEPT THIS EVEN IT'S  FREE!   (Not even worth your hard drive space)			"

												You know that feeling you get when you purchase a game, and it turns out to be one of the best decisions you've ever made. The combat is great, and the mechanics are cool, you play it with your friends; and you all laugh out loud ""HAHAHAHA"" and you say ""I'm so glad we bought this game!""This game is the opposite of that... This game is probably the worst thing to ever happen to anyone....EVER, literally it's like a really really really fat guy that walks onto the train you and your friends are on, and he sits right next to you, and he smiles at you, it's a bit disconcerting, but you smile back. And then you hear it, the loudest, longest fart you've ever heard, you try to ignore it  and put your shirt over your mouth. But it doesn't help, the smell penetrates your nostrils, and seeps into your eye sockets. Your eyes start to water and your heart starts beating out of your chest, you just have to get out of there. You look back to the man sitting beside you, He's just smiling at you, his grin penetrating you skin and burrowing into your soul. Your friends start to convulse, Issac your friend since early child hood, projectile vomits across the train carriage, you are now covered im vomit. you begin to cry, the man starts to laugh. the sound like a wet towel slapping against a tiled floor, tears streak down your face and in your mind you can't help but think to yourself.....why did i buy this terrible game			"

I have put more then 1000 hours (before it was on steam) and i have not regreted any second of it. Then, the hackers came in... The game was still playable but it was now descending quickly. Now it is at a point that each server you enter you will meet a hacker. If the Hackers were to be eliminated i believe this game could once again thrive.			"

												If you can pick up this game on sale for a dollar, it might be worth checking out, if you ever wanted to check out the 'zombie survival MMO experience' for cheap.(Better choice over Day-Z - along with the empty and broken promises of Day-Z devs - and H1Z1, which does not say much at all).Despite being likely the best zombie survival MMO to date, I'm going to recommend against this game, as it is plagued by lame cheaters (always has been) and the developers really do not care.Having said that, this game would be solid and damn good fun, if they only had some effective anti-cheat.* If you do decide to pick up this title *watch out for the Brazilians* and tread carfully.* Zombies are the least of your concern in a post apocalypic world where resources are limited.

												with over 300 hundred hours in this game I will go ahead and review it. I have been an avid supporter of this game taking up for it around every corner and telling everyone about all of the good things this game has to offer. Well listen people when I tell you that there are no good aspects to this game anymore. This game is a scam and buyer beware because if you do happen to purchase this game you better be on the look out for hackers in every server and the game devs around every corner. Also just know that when you are facing an enemy during a pvp battle that he has the chance to hit one key that takes him straight to the games marketplace where he can buy healing items or even armor while you engage in a shoot out. The game thrives on hackers because thats how they still make revenue.			"

												I wake up a foot or two above the ground. As I land, the world around me starts to become clear. Trees have taken over the world. I wander throughout the day with my flashlight on, until I come across what appears to be a large amount of zombies surrounding a random spot in the road where everyone has decided to park their cars and leave. I approach with caution. I run up and jump onto the back of a truck. That's when I find myself a delicious candy bar. I enjoy this sweet piece of tastiness. Then the zombies learn to climb. I bash their skulls in with my flashlight with ease. I pick up a rifle to pick off the rest. Little did I know, it had no bullets. Gun is useless. Zombies are now entirely surrounding me. I spend the next half hour breaking the heads of the zombies with my extremely durable flashlight until the coast is clear. I make a run for it. I find a farm, but unfortunately, it is filled with nothing but duct tape. I also found a glow stick, but alas, my small kindergarden backpack could not carry any more, as it was filled with tape. That's when I set out to find a home for the night. I search effortlessly, when I finally see a city. It is very close, I start to run. Suddenly, zombies start teleporting to my location. What do I do? Kill them with my flashlight. Oh no! My flashlight no longer hits where I tell it to! I swing but no matter how many times the light makes contact with the zombie, it continues to brush right through it! I am forced to run. I run to the city, finally safe. I find a revolver on the ground, good. Now I can survive better. Wait! No I can't! Sniped. My journey had ended. As I die, all of my duct tape falls out onto the ground. Then... Oh man... Then I was forced... To... Wait around 20 minutes. OR PAY TO REVIVE NOW! :DI recommend this game to anyone who loves crying and spending $20 on digital glow sticks!			"

I can finally express my true thought without restriction. After a year of playing this game, I feel I would like to express my through for the game.First off I love this game. This game could be so much fun if the developer would actually listen to me. I truly wanted this game to success. I truly do love this game. I personally spend over 100 dollar in this game. I have brought over 6 accounts and I have no regret what so ever in buying this game. This is game can exciting and rage inducing game. This game has a high risk factor which can make or break you. I personally find that there are a lot good people who play this game. I also know some of them will can also stab you in the back. One of my most negative experiences was that I find out that the dev and mods were talk crap about other player. Yes some of the people in the community are annoying but it not needs to talk crap about them. The incident with Mad Max aka Striker Cade and a new developer Artemis knives is a fine example of this. I have heard of from a ex Moderator that the dev were talking negative thing about their playerbase and daily too. It a shame this company lack of professionism to it playerbase. I have keep silent about many incident. However now that I have nothing else left. I am going to say this. They clearly didn't expect for the game to do so well. The dev have no faith in it fanbase on it forum community. I even find out that both Kewk and Zombert have talk crap about me too. ( i know you read my personal PMs too) However my love for this game have kept me silent and I do wish this game to be as big as League of Legend or even DOTA. However the dev lack of respect and faith on their community will be it downfall.I have seen multiple their fans actually tired to help make this game better. However the direction of the developer of OP production was very misleading. They have promise multiple time they will fix the issue and many time they never even try to fix the problem. Look at unstable server continue disconnection from server. There are many bugs and buggy zombie. I understand you have a small team but it over a year. we have waited over for a year for stronghold. It nothing but a death arena. I have remain positive this whole time however I am not going to sit by and watch something I care about died with a fight . I even play legit all this time. I never even cheated once in this game and I will never cheat in this game. I have been kill so many time that by hacker and I stop caring about it. I have stop caring about them now as this is a never ending battle. Yeah the dev have step up their anti cheat. Yeah Fairfight is a good anti cheat system . However this undermine by the cheap account situation. i know dev you are in need of money. This revolving door policy is not good in the long run. I know they have HWID ip banned. I have seen it in action . It can be very effective however they do not use it. Yeah it a revolving door policy.I know it long but bear with me. Support I know support is nonexistence until this year . Yeah I have sent ticket too. None were answer until this year by a real person. They close all my ticket from last year and never solve any of them. However I admit support now is a alot better and there is no more automated closed response and it a good start from there. Yes if you hacked they know and they do check ip too. So you cannot send a ticket for your friend.I even got a warning point for reporting a duper who was c-mag and was streaming it too. Yes Kewk give a warning point and I never report a duper until he quited. I give public posting about them and warn you about them. I personally took that too heart. Do you know why now there is a black market and why you are losing money now. I have warned you that duper existed. They are even showing it the public and it so easy to find it too. You can hide on your forum but not the internet. This reward of new duping method for 1000000Gc is a joke and no one will report it now. You have made people in fear of report their finding. I personally know of only one method right now . However it not worth duping anymore. As sniper rifle were duped like it was in style and people have over 100 sniper in their legit account lockbox. I can say one thing was it worth silenting your loyal fanbase. The forum was a treasure of info. Even hacker announce their attack against you daliy. I have over 8500 post and I read the forum and never forget them. They would make spam site and hack login and many other thing. Almost half of the trader there was a hacker or is hacker. I know them by their name. I personally feel that you should bring back gc trading at least then you can make money from that. Instead of them using the black market. I have many thing I wish to tell you however I want to leave it one positive note. Dev and staff of OP Production this game is wonderful and it even could have been a great success However you just keep making the same mistake over and over again. I have tell you the flaw of them. If you choose to listen or don't. I personally hope do success but I believe your flaws will caught up to you. Love you lot Black Lotus			"

I played it from launch and If you like useless Devs that promise stuff and never do it, That love milking your money, changing there company name and doing the same again under a new banner and love playing games that the gameplay is so unbelievably boring, repetative and unplayable. This is the game for you!!!! If you like Zombie survival simulation, Good games, where the developers actualy care and provide for their customers, Spend a little more and get Dayz. Dayz is really good. Why am I reviewing this game.			"

												This game has so much controversie that I read the terms of use. This game has a horrible past of♥♥♥♥♥♥ There are so many hackers on this game that they got accses to the games source code meaning lots of people got free emulators of this game. Hackers on this game at one point where so bad, that some people got there personal information leaked such as IP addres's, Emails, and passwords. This game is dangerous. Aside form that.... The game is fun for about, half a hour. Then you get tired of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stamina system, bland graphics, and its horrible sound. The developers lock or delete any discussion pages that have negetive comments or data about anything controversial. People get banned every few hours.

												 Insanely pointless on the whole. All serveres/games/areas etc are ripe with pvp trolls, little loot, and very few ways to defend yourself against them. Zombies themselves offer no indication of where they ACTUALLY are or where they are attacking from, the game simply regurgitates the noises over and over from different directions at random. Very annoying game to try to play, with very few rewards, and even fewer ways to get ahead ingame.			"

This game has anti-cheat? - WTF??? Where??? Turned off???2.) Marketplace - Yea I love to buy the game and after it just ""pay to win"" and spend more money like♥♥♥♥♥got3.) Zombies = Terminators - Smashing zombies with baseball bat 11times? (head and upper part) - How can they survive so long? -> Cause they're made of f*ckin steel man!!!4.) Houses interior - Yea  some empty houses with nothing (no chairs, table or some sh!t) - ???5.) Damage of some guns - I dont know but how the f*ck it is possible to shoot someone right into head and not kill (when he's/she's not wearing helmet)6.) Hackers - This game shouts ""Buy me to meet some hackers bro!"" (No thx I dont need to meet some hackers)7.) Bans - Looks like cheaters are getting banned in like 1year or some bigger delay8.) PTE servers - I like them for stuff farming but you know 99,99% hackers and 0.01% campers and noobs => anti-cheat POWA cant be found here9.) Many bugs, glitches and failed textures - Playing for 2 minutes on PTE server and I found 2+ failed textures and some other fails from developer side10.) Developers - developers say ""Everything we need from you is to give us your money and we wont care about game"" - Thats said from me cause they arent able to have solid anti-cheat, ban hackers faster, making stupid textures with no collision, they dont care about community.11.) PVP/PVE - please just make 1 ♥♥♥♥in PVE server for people who dont like spraying people with guns like♥♥♥♥♥♥♥for flashlight...My reason why I play this game ""Cause Im laughing how terrible it is and how many cheaters, bugs, exploits, failed textures you can find and also dont forget ""There's no anti-cheat in-game"" (Or Im just blind and anti-cheat is invisible for my account)But still - just ""♥♥♥♥IN NOOOOOOOOO"" - if you want zombie game buy yourself something better (this game is not worth of 1 dollar or more - I got it for 50cents f*ck yea)			"

												So after 500 hours of playing this game.....For the first week it was awesome to play cause it was a new genre for me I really liked the game. Killing Zombies and stuff you know ^^? But later it is just very boring to play. You will find an easy way to kill Zombies(jumping on something). Everyone is trying to kill you. I loved farming in the world of COLORADO(map) but they added a SUPERZOMBIE which is very hard to kill and you just need more of your farmed ammo and weopens. It is PAY TO WIN. To many HACKERS.Weopenspread is♥♥♥♥♥♥...So pls COMMUNITY don't buy this game! It's not worth your money!			"

												I had fun playing this game but I like to grind and survive. Don't trust the pictures where you see a  lot of people laying out zombies with rifles and such. Ammo, for guns, are weapon specific and incredibly rare and not worth using on zombies. You'll have better luck finding duplicate weapons and emptying it than you will finding a loose magazine.You will spend your first part of the game finding remote spawn points for food, water, and loot and server hopping to other almost empty servers to empty that same spot over and over.Then you'll spend time trying to not get killed by other people as you loot more dangerous areas(airport) where the somewhat good drops are and about 10 million zombies are found...Not a long term game to play, I wouldn't recommend it or expect a friend to play it with me.

												Great idea, TERRIBLE! execution.This game is truely terrible... It needs to be burned with fire asap.It is/was nothing more then a simple cash grab game... it came out over-hyped, didnt diliver what it promised (had alot of false advertisement, and was removed from steam twice lol).Its a terrible game cashing in on the ""zombie"" phase that everyone is on atm.I was an original backer of this game and played during early alpha testing, and back then they had an excuse to have a less then good game since its in alpha. It looked promosing.But not much has changed since alpha for the better...-Graphics are nothing to talk about. Looks like some crappy game from 2004 when on max settings.-Audio is terrible.-The physics/game engine is just poor...-Hackers/cheaters galore.-From what i hear, A LOT of legit players are being banned becuase of their crappy ban system (i think a 5yo can find a better way to stop cheaters... Want to know how they stop cheaters? they place items in areas which are impossible to get to, and if you pick up that item you get banned. But its so poorly done, that these items can be picked up through walls or the celing of building if u jump)-Terrible devs, terrible customer supportTo give you mroe insight on this company.I payed $25 for a game in aplha. It was released for $15 on release... (who knew aplha costs more then release!)On top of that, i literally had to fight for WEEKS to get a free copy of the steam version, since i wanted the game on steam...Trying to get a $10 refund was beating a dead horse though...To give you a little more information (btw the game used to be called WarZ)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infestation:_Survivor_Stories#Reception""In October 2012 executive producer Sergey Titov referred to spawn campers in The War Z as ""♥♥♥♥♥♥s"" in a forum post""their PR team teird to cover for him and say, o he isnt against homosexuality... but he couldnt come out and say it >.>Remember that is the EXECUTIVE PRODUCER! not just some lowely low wage employee or forum mod or something...That would be like the CEO of walmart calling african americans the N word... how much would u respect them if they did something like that?....The list goes on, and im sure there is WAY more not being listed on this wiki.Also know ""PCPowerplay gave the game a zero (out of ten), the only zero in the magazine's history""the game is only $15, maybe less if on sale. ya its not much money, and im sure you may get a few dollars worth of cheap fun from the game.BUT i would NOT suggest supporting these kind of developers or companies with even a SINGLE PENNY!

												 Insanely pointless on the whole. All serveres/games/areas etc are ripe with pvp trolls, little loot, and very few ways to defend yourself against them. Zombies themselves offer no indication of where they ACTUALLY are or where they are attacking from, the game simply regurgitates the noises over and over from different directions at random. Very annoying game to try to play, with very few rewards, and even fewer ways to get ahead ingame.			"

												This game was very fun for me for a while then i realized how many people actually do have hacks and esp's. The servers are not well kept and are filled with snipers with aimbots or speed hacks. There is not much to do except collect gear and run through the world and get mad ever time a hacker walks through the wall and kills you. Its only 5 dollars though so if you looking for a cheap way to get really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off very quickly then ISS is the game for you. The only up side to all this NOTHING there is no upside. I have a good bit of time on this game and ton's of gear but still its really not all worth it even with a new map there is still nothing to do. The developers really need to get there Sh$$ togeather and fix the real problems before they add things into the game. The Devs are not very nice either. They are very money hungry they took the survival away from the game when they put an in game store into the mix. So if your a hacker or just have money to spare you can just gear up and get all the ammo and armor/meds that you want and never loose. My conclusion to all this ramble is if you want to get a cheap survival game for 5 bucks please please please dont buy this one i can assure you it is a huge waist of your time.			"

												               To be honest, I really don't mind playing I:SS. I picked this up during the summer sale a year ago I think, and I enjoyed playing it for the first hour. After that, the magic's gone. Everyone is constantly paranoid and the KoS is not a problem, it's a fact. I can't remember the last time someone actually talked to me in this without immediately shooting me or getting their friends to kill me. Not to mention the lack of communication is kinda a bust, the majority of people would rather kill you for your flashlight and Granola bars, then proceed to t-bag you and write 2nd grade insults at you.                In short, the gameplay is at times frustrating/painful, but makes up for when you get items, the developers (In my opinion) are getting alot better with the updates/feedback/community for the game, but the weakest link in this has to be the few ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that kill for♥♥♥♥♥♥all and ruin the experience for many.

												This game is Madness. If you do not mind being hunted by everything alive and dead in an online world with nothing but a granola bar, a small backpack, and a flashlight, it will test your mental toughness as it does all it can to eliminate you.If you are OK with all of that, are up to a challenge, and are used to pain and suffering     WELCOME TO INFESTATION SURVIVOR STORIES !!!

												This is a horrible game to start off. First, this game is not even close to being fun. Also this game offers ""gold"" to buy. Without gold you are constantly struggling to have ANY fun. The survival aspect is just bad, feels like it tried to copy DayZ and made a worse copy. Also it is pretty hard to find things in this game, and without any weapon it takes FOREEEVER to kill a zombie. This game also have a HORRIBLE RESPAWN system, everytime you die you have to WAIT or buy thier gold to respawn faster. I hate this game with a passion.			"

												Of course i knew this game was like out-of-the-world-bad but as a special joke for my 100th game on Steam i thought i'd give it a try, for 1,49€ made out of Weapon Skins it was ok. Sooooo... I can't say I regret this decission but at least i would have liked to try out this ""game"". Well, it's not letting me. After doubleclicking a server I get the loadscreen for about 2 minutes followed by a 10 second freeze frame of the game and then the game telling me it's lost connection back in the character screen. Needless to say I didn't enjoy this ""game"".			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories, previous name WarZ. Because the new film ""World War Z"", the game must rename, so I:SS Is new name, but is same bulls*it like WarZ. Let me tell you why not buy this game.Gameplay:You are going to spawn somewhere, u got few choices, random spawn points, but its only few of them... Some town, mostly PvP town, some forest or near the safe zone.You are going to loot something, like towns, military bases and more. But u got enemies! 1.) Retar*ed zombies and retar*ed players.Players in this game.... thats a worst community in games history! If u play DayZ, u will see reality of apocalypse, helping each other, making a new friends, not like in I:SS.... u will meet someone, *bam* u are dead.... Zombies.. #hahaha      -► Zombies are so retar*ed, if u are in the house, they will searching for the main entrance of the building for over then 10 mins! My score - 2/10 - Very, VERY BAD GAMEPositives/negatives+Positive:If u are playing the zombie game for the 1st time, u like Deathmatches, this game is for you.Not bad items, in game its lot of items, some cool stuff!-Negative:- Retar*ed Zombies- retar*ed players- Pay 2 win!!!- PVP, no communication- Kill on sight- Graphic - Gameplay- Combat system- Updates of the game... they are almost more retartded then the zombies in the game!- It cost 13 Euro! !WARNING! PLEASE DONT BUY THIS GAME!			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.' Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. To this day, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												This game is the pinical of perfect action thriller set in a zombie enviroment. It's atmosphere crushes your very soul into dust, leaving you a crippled wreck. You will pray for relief but none will come, you are traped in a hell-scape befit for no sane man. From dust you were born, to dusk you shall return screaming all the way to hell.

												Wow, dont you hate this game? I'm so glad that I only paid 1.99 dollars....I wouldn't invest in this game, based on so many things. I know after reading the reviews I should not have bought it. I mean first time playing, hit by a zombie like maybe 3 time at night, and I was dead. Then I thought well let me just jump back in I won't make the same mistake. Oh you can get back in... about 8 minutes or pay to revive him. EIGHT FRIGGEN MINUTES!?!?! WTF IS THAT? Ok now I get back in, I decided that I would find at least a melee weapon, and I find a barn, run inside, find a golf club, grab it, and three zombies from all the open doors corner me. I killed two trying to get out, and as I exit , one zombie kills me with one swipe. Do you think I wait for another eight minutes....F*#@k no!!Come on guys(developers) are you sure this was your goal to create a game? I think this is a make the money off as many gamers as possible and run (abandon) it. I feel like I've been lied to. This is not even an early release..this is a rip off!!!!!!!Do not waste one single penny!!!!!!!!! Its worthless..worst game I've ever played. I repeat DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY AWAY TO PEOPLE THAT NO NOTHING ABOUT GAMING!!			"

												I bought this game awhile back when it was on sale for $3.74 and to be honest that was the worst waste of money in my life. This game is really horrid. They try to make fixes but don't fix the main issues. They charge real money to get ammo or anything of the sort. Sure some stuff is easy enough to obtain if you don't get randomly skull crushed by a flash light. The only good thing that I thought this game did was they actually made the zombies slow. That was it! The controls are clunky the weapon collsion with the zombies is horrible. I mean when I hit a zombie with a hammer or with a boat oar their head should♥♥♥♥♥♥back a little. Personally the Walking Dead Survival Instinct is a better game than this one. Their both garbage, but at least the WD has a little bit of a story and the controls are slightly better. Really this game should just be a free to play; then maybe they could get more customers and make improvements.			"

												I've played this game since it came out, and to be honest there isn't much positive feedback that I can think of.The game has a really good concept, which has been completely ruined by the greedy and ignorant developers.Pros:1. Good concept.Cons:1. Really crappy developers that does what THEY think is best for the game, not listening to the community at all.2. Low resolution graphics, pixels are showing really well at most points.3. The ambient sounds are the worst I've ever heard, mostly annoying and adds nothing to the game.4. The game is FILLED with hackers. (Better now than before)Conclusion: Bad game overall, pretty much everything is useless, except for the PVP, which is fun at times but has alot of flaws aswell. If I could buy this game again, I wouldn't. Would you?			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories is a good game for 30 minutes then it becomes a bad looking game ! The textures off most objects are smudged/blurred. This feels like a cheap, low budget, copy of DayZ.There are 1st and 3rd person views. The zombies are fast and it is nearly impossible to run away from, they can take you out in 2-3 hits, then you die, which then makes you have to wait a long time for your player to respawn.There are players who play this game and will always win in fights unless you have the right equipment.The game is alot of money and is best to get when on a deal.

												This game is driven by micro-transactions in game.  Those who spend $$ get better gear and ammo and those who don't are taken out by those who do.  Poor programming, only a few types of zombies and very very predictable spawns.   Save your money and either invest in Arma II and get the DayZ mod -  the ORIGINAL zombie survival MMO - or invest in the new DayZ Standalone.  10x more world to discover, MUCH better detail and graphics, and MUCH better gameplay.

												My wife and I have spend hours on this game, several hundred dollars only to be let down over and over. This game has the potential to be so much more but with poor management this game has sunk beyond what any words could really say. The pvp aspect of the game sucks because you might end up being ganked and drop all of your hard earned gear yet at the same time if you want a PVE area you end up having to pay an outrageous price for the ""Private"" server of theirs then that fully kills the entire MMO part of the game. Seems to me they could do as many MMO's have done and made a pvp system where the game has spots that are contested or something or have PVE servers that allow you to enjoy the game. I am now holding off on putting any more life into this game and waiting on H1Z1 from Sony. ISS had great potential yet they let it fail....			"

												The WarZ or... ""Infestation: Survivor Stories"" (Renamed because WarZ are infamous for some of the stupid and wrong things they have done so they're tricking you by changing the title.)I picked it up for a buck, still not worth it. The devs for this game are just downright sickening in their treatment of players, they have thretened to blacklist their credit cards, they have thretened lawsuits against people who critisized the game, they're pathedic and I feel terrible for supporting them, even if it is just with one dollar, but that's another dollar that's lining these greedy, lying scumbags' pockets. Cons:1.) They lie on the recomended system requirements, I run a machine slightly better than those and no, 1-5 FPS is not acceptable2.) The options menu is absolutly terrible, Terraria has a better options menu and It's a 2D sidescroller3.) The zombies are ridiculously overpowered, they run faster, they do insane amounts of damage and infect you, and unless you have quite a bit of money on you, you have to pay to cure your character4.) I paid for the title and now you want me to go ""Premium"" for no extra content, only free weapons and lower teir currency... money grabbing slimeballs5.) The game's absolutly full of hackers, I mean, ridiculously full of hackers.6.) The doesn't allow you to customize a render distance7.) The game boasts features it doesn't even have yet8.) The game changed their name to ""infestation: survivor stories"" But the devs were too lazy to rename the gamefiles so it's listed as ""The War Z"" 9.) Instead of giving us a large map they gave us a decant sized map and made the player slow as all hell, lazy, lazy devs.Pros:1.) They have quite a few resolutions however, if you have one of the larger moniters (IE that 2000x???? resolution) You're fresh out of luck.2.) When it isn't spazzing out, flickering, clipping through objects and dropping your framerate to downright ridiculous numbers some of the effects look like a moderately pretty PS2 title... (oh that's not what they were going for?)3.)...That's about it... yea, To wrap it up:The devs are corrupt, sneaky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and don't get me wrong, I usually have the upmost respect for the devs however this? No... Your title is unfit for purpose, this game is a scam, they lie about quite a few features of the game, most of those aren't even implimented while others are just downright broken when they are in, the gameplay is tedious and frustrating and it's just a downright terrible title. Save yourselves the trouble and go buy the Arma II collection or the DayZ standalone if you're looking for a zombie survival horror post apocalyptic-y game. This is not worth your time and certainly not worth mine.			"

Their late anticheat system looks to be laughable, as much as I got permabanned after becoming inactive until today March 16th 2014! Not only that, the only way to get my account back is by requesting to local law enforcers... Seriously, they want to avoid the burden of undo'ing their own mess. Incompetence!			"

They just banned my account for nothing, a lot of people got banned on this game for nothing...If I recommend this game for someone? No. I would tell them to save their money for another game...			"

												The Developers dont listen to people, banning them for no reason, and rewarding the people who pay money on the game with a hat, and no, not a hat for you, a hat for your in game character.

												This game makes my balls shoot back into my body. I bought this game during the giant ""Open World Zombie Survival"" hype but this game has proven many things to me. If zombies are real, they have the ability to walk faster then a human being running at 20 miles per hour. Cars don't even exist. Guns are more common then food and water. Zombies are god and can fly to you and kill you by giving you 3 love taps. Did I mention that the game uses the Crisis Engine? No thats cause it doesnt. The graphics look like a small 3 year old threw up on his/her's finger painting. Oh and walking on non-steep hills killed you before it was patched. Also the devs are the biggest liars about the games content.Also the head creator of this game made the worst game known to man. Big Rigs.0.1/10  (Hey atleast they took art from The Walking Dead)PSI think this is the second son of Bad Rats			"

Community of trolls and greedy people.-Predictable and oftentimes glitchy zombie AI-Items oftentimes too scarce to even survive.-Death timers, anyone?

To sum it up it's war inc with zombies added! and this took 7 months to make? Even when it was released it was broke! The last thing is micro transcations, you buy credits in game to buy weapons and masks. YOU BUY CREDITS BUT I JUST BOUGHT THE GAME! I don't buy a game to be given micro transactions for better things this would be fine if you could find the items in game but no they are exclusive micro transcation items! There is no excuse for it. The only time I would excuse micro transactions in a video game is if it was free to play. Overall don't waste your money on this peice of rubbish, go and by the newly released DayZ standalone instead. I have played the DayZ mod which was great so the standalone should be to. Thank you for reading and I hope you take this in to cosideration when thinking of buying WarZ or should I call it INFESTATION SURVIVOR STORIES! more like bories!			"

The real danger are your fellow players, which usualy kill you immediately, thus causing you to lose all your loot that you spend real money on.I can see why it has a metascore of 20, and why it was pulled from steam 2 times.

												Could be a brilliant game, however devs seem more interested in milking money and deceiving the community instead of fixing game breaking bugs. Servers are terribly unreliable, and you may get disconnected (and killed by zombies while waiting to get back into the game) at random.The only infestation in this game is from hackers, and this has been amplified by the removal of punkbuster (and unbanning) of tens of thousands of previously banned accounts, who are now able to download free cheats and exploit the game.

												Don't bother wasting your time. I literally bought this game just so show support for an up and coming developer. Bought it, installed it, ran it to go through all the settings (wanted to make sure I can get this running at 5760 x 1080 normally)...... didn't get around to actually trying to get into a game for a few weeks. When I finally got the time to play it, I log into my account and it tells me my account has been banned. I emailed the developer to inquire as to why, and the response I got was appalling. It said my account was caught using hacks, and/or third party software while playing, and that the decision to ban my account was final and not reversible.With ZERO MINUTES OF ACTUALLY GAMEPLAY!			"

												11 hours of my life spent playing this, that I'll never get back. Not a very good game, not a good game at all. They charge you for EVERYTHING, you can even buy some things with the money you get for free, but it takes a life time to gather money to buy anything. This is not even close to finished. And the worst part is: If you spend real money buying items and you die.. The item just dissapears. No story, no soundtrack, just a LOT of bugs, crashes, lags and god damn hackers. DO NOT BUY IT!

												I've played this game since it came out, and to be honest there isn't much positive feedback that I can think of.The game has a really good concept, which has been completely ruined by the greedy and ignorant developers.Pros:1. Good concept.Cons:1. Really crappy developers that does what THEY think is best for the game, not listening to the community at all.2. Low resolution graphics, pixels are showing really well at most points.3. The ambient sounds are the worst I've ever heard, mostly annoying and adds nothing to the game.4. The game is FILLED with hackers. (Better now than before)Conclusion: Bad game overall, pretty much everything is useless, except for the PVP, which is fun at times but has alot of flaws aswell.

												Infestation: Survivor Stories is a good game for 30 minutes then it becomes a bad looking game ! The textures off most objects are smudged/blurred. This feels like a cheap, low budget, copy of DayZ.There are 1st and 3rd person views. The zombies are fast and it is nearly impossible to run away from, they can take you out in 2-3 hits, then you die, which then makes you have to wait a long time for your player to respawn.There are players who play this game and will always win in fights unless you have the right equipment.The game is alot of money and is best to get when on a deal.

												THIS IS THE WORSE GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED.   I would not play this game if it was free.  The whole point of the game is to make you spend real money to purchase ingame gear.  BUT as soon as you die you loose all purchased items and have to buy the same gear again iwth real money.This may be the WORSE GAME EVER MADE.  I WANT my 17 bucks back.			"

												This is just WarZ with a new name. DO NOT BUY.It's much more fun (and free) to browse the forums and read all the hate posted there, or to follow the patch notes, because I'm honestly convinced the devs are trying their best to somehow make the game worse-- and bravo if that's the case. How they haven't quit or offed themselves from sheer shame for making this abomination leads me to believe that they have no dignity, self-respect or knowledge of right and wrong. I'm serious. They should be making daily apologies to all the deranged players that have such poor taste in gaming or are just so easily entertained that they actually enjoy this offensive excuse for a game. Anyone who is associated in the production of this game should be laughed out of any future game development career. (Expect whoever did the gun modeling / gun sounds. That isn't too shabby, but you'd never know because you rarely fire a shot.) There is not a single redeeming quality to this plague. The concept was torn from DayZ, the devs make empty promises, the support is nonexistant, there are hackers in every server, there is FPS lag no matter your specs or quality settings, your account infomation is not at all safe and the prices for items ingame are inexcusable. Please look into ""WarZ emulators"" if you must try this game. The source code was ripped a while back and several emulators popped up. The emulators not only run the game better, but have more features and less bugs. They're also free, which is good because you do NOT want to give your money to these folks.			"

												I will keep this review brief, though i feel for this game it is a public service that needs to be done. Stay away from this game, you dont want it. Most people are aware of the terribly scammy practices Hammerpoint Interactive has engaged in, but for everyone one who knows there may very well be 100 who dont know.So, i'm gonna just run down the list in no particular order: Dedicated servers were promised, and that promise was not delivered upon. Enforcement of game rules and punishment of cheaters was also promised, yet there are plenty of people who use wallhacks/ aimbot (and I'm far from trigger-happy when it comes to accusing people of such things, because I fully realize that there are people who are better than me at videogames).A significantly larger amount of player slots per server was promised, compared to the less-than-128player-servers we currently have.And the real big one that grinds my gears? The game was originally advertised as being totally free to play with the purchasable items being cosmetic. this is something that they refuse to enact in practice, as you can buy all sorts of spiffy backpacks, guns, and blades (rentals too, of course) and some of these weapons can never be found in game, as well as being vastly stronger than their non cash-shop weapons.in short, a scam by any other name is still a scam.

												There are no ordinary zombies... Instead of throwing themselves at you with tooth and claw, these mean sum'♥♥♥♥♥es fly into an epilectic fit of rage and use their telekinetic mastery to end you without even touching.There are no ordinary players... Instead of A-holes holding you up or killing you for your goods, many of these guys don only the finest invisibilty cloaks, making nothing but their backpack and flashlight visible before beating you mercilessly with it (The torch, not the backpack. I think). These are no ordinary micro-transactions... Instead of being the alternative of infinite-houred grinding, the MT's make you pay for pointless misc's that you'll use or lose within moments (Ah, Capitalism).These are no ordinary physics... Instead of fall damage happening after large drops, or being able to climb up onto cars for protection, or... just... just ♥♥♥♥ all that. Die from jumping down a stair, let the telekinetic zombies just kill you through anything, just anything that makes things more frustrating.WarZ (Oops, sorry Dev's), all jokes aside, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.

												So, I do not understand this game, I have no clue why it exists, if I could at least play the game it would be great! However I cannot run it because I get the terrain 3 error and yet games like DayZ standalone run smoothly on my PC and yet this game says my GPU does not support terrain 3. After looking on the internet many people had the same problem but its not been fixed, and before I could run it on a much worse rig! How is this even possible that the devs are so useless? (excluding a few).Please this game hd potential but it was ruined by the in game shop where you can buy ammo and food and all other stuff, this defeats the whole point of this being a survival game!

												Want my money back, quite honestly.Shambles of a game - rather than fixing current issues, such as fixing the poor optimization, they go ahead and add more clutter to the scenery only to make frame rate worse.People have pleaded the developers to optimize the game plenty of times, but have not delievered. They said during the next two weeks (November 2012) there would be cars, strongholds, etc - but what they really meant is '...in a years time we will add so and so'.Avoid this game.

												I will keep this review brief, though i feel for this game it is a public service that needs to be done. Stay away from this game, you dont want it. Most people are aware of the terribly scammy practices Hammerpoint Interactive has engaged in, but for everyone one who knows there may very well be 100 who dont know.So, i'm gonna just run down the list in no particular order: Dedicated servers were promised, and that promise was not delivered upon. Enforcement of game rules and punishment of cheaters was also promised, yet there are plenty of people who use wallhacks/ aimbot (and I'm far from trigger-happy when it comes to accusing people of such things, because I fully realize that there are people who are better than me at videogames).A significantly larger amount of player slots per server was promised, compared to the less-than-128player-servers we currently have.And the real big one that grinds my gears? The game was originally advertised as being totally free to play with the purchasable items being cosmetic. this is something that they refuse to enact in practice, as you can buy all sorts of spiffy backpacks, guns, and blades (rentals too, of course) and some of these weapons can never be found in game, as well as being vastly stronger than their non cash-shop weapons.in short, a scam by any other name is still a scam.

Instead of throwing themselves at you with tooth and claw, these mean sum'♥♥♥♥♥es fly into an epilectic fit of rage and use their telekinetic mastery to end you without even touching.There are no ordinary players... Instead of A-holes holding you up or killing you for your goods, many of these guys don only the finest invisibilty cloaks, making nothing but their backpack and flashlight visible before beating you mercilessly with it (The torch, not the backpack. I think). These are no ordinary micro-transactions... Instead of being the alternative of infinite-houred grinding, the MT's make you pay for pointless misc's that you'll use or lose within moments (Ah, Capitalism).These are no ordinary physics... Instead of fall damage happening after large drops, or being able to climb up onto cars for protection, or... just... just ♥♥♥♥ all that. Die from jumping down a stair, let the telekinetic zombies just kill you through anything, just anything that makes things more frustrating.WarZ (Oops, sorry Dev's), all jokes aside, is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.

Why?- crappy servers with laggs- crappy gameplay (if you are looking for zombie survival game then turn around and run away- this is a PVP game- there are no friends, zombies are the weakest enemy- the real enemy is EVERYONE controlled by humans)- constant FairFight/Punkbuster kicks out of the game (i don't use any modifications/hacks/whatnot)- laggs which kill you and make you loose all your items- 60 minutes death penalty (you can pay real $$ to remedy this.... sic!)- if you are looking for a definition of ""money grabbing devs"" look no further- Devs of this game are the masters in this (to the point of making the (not a free game) game unplayable without real money microtransactions.what else.... oh yeah- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.BTW, I believe this is the first and only game i haven't found any +++, just ---.Ooooh, it has zombies... there you go, one + in the whole game.

												I bought this game with high expectations, from the cool screenshots and trailer, little did I know that those were all taken in high settings. I play on an average computer on medium settings and still this game looked no way closer to those pictures on the market... Every single time you spawn in you get rekt by the zombies or get spawn killed because the spawns are terrible. If you are reading this review to see if you should buy this I tell you HELL NO YOU SHOULDN'T GET THIS GAME!! It is so terrible that you should probably lick a cactus, if you have bought this game please gauge your eyes  out because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥graphics. I'm almost positive that the most fun part of this game is watching it be refunded because it is terrible on so many levels. The community is filled with little 3 year-old fanboys that think this is the best thing since sliced bread. I recommend that no one should get this game EVER, but what I do recommend doing over playing this COMPLETE AND UTTER♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME is rubbing your balls against a cactus...			"

												What to say about infestation survivor stories previously known as the war z, the game itself has various issues pertaining to frame rate, various and numerious game grashes, Random disconections and that is not even scratching the surface on the various hackers that roam the game,   but if you can look past these various inperfections it can be quite an enjoyable romp especially if playing with outhers which is highly advisable due to the high level of hostile players. In closing I would rate this game a solid 8 out of 10 enjoy.			"

												Absolute garbage. I can't believe I believed my friends when they picked this up. Glitchy, poor animations, and much slower and incomplete than DayZ. Zombies are difficult to kill, and not because of their abilities, amount of health, or movement - but because of poor hit detection, hit radius, and other aspects that were poorly programmed (The animations and hit registration don't match up aesthetically) You clip on objects that you shouldn't clip on, and don't clip through things you would think would stop you. Don't waste your money, even if it's $2.67. Edit: Furthermore, I recently went back to try and give it a second chance, since I had already given the developer my money, and found out that I was permabanned for this comment. Now they have my money and have technically robbed me of the experience (or lack-there-of) that I paid for.They've refused to respond to my tickets. Spiteful, poor development, etc. I honestly don't wish negative things on people or businesses often, but their product and business practices have convinced me that these people don't deserve jobs in product development and I hope reading this will deter as many purchasers as possible to prevent this developer from getting any further. They already believe they're immune to proper practices, clearly, and if they gather enough money they'll just be in the position they want to be in: too big to fail. Vote with your money, and put your vote somewhere that it will count (Which is definitely not in infestation survivor stories)			"

												So I had put off buying this game due to all the horrible reviews, metacritic rating, and the fact the developers basically p*ssed all over loyal players/paying supports of previous games(War Inc) but I desided to give it a shot anyway since it was on sale for $3. Let me start by saying most of the horrible reviews are true.-Graphics?Low quality and poorly optimzied. That means it's not super pretty but still runs slowly.-Sound?Your own SFX(footsteps, splashing,etc..) are way too loud if you have SFX set to a level so they actually help you detect threats. Sound also doesn't seem to be optimized properlly. Locating something by sound is hit or miss.-World?The map is very large. With lots of locations to explore. It would probably take near an hour to walk from one corner to the other. That's great but it can be VERY inconvient is there is no quick travel or selective spawning. But ultimatly there is still only one map. There also aren't that many building models and you will see things reused a lot.-GamePlayExploring, avoiding zombies, collecting supplies. All fun. Ranged combat is fairly tuned as it was ported directly from War Inc. Melee combat is horribly simple and poorly done on top. Zombie AI is horrible. They get stuck. Can't climb anything over 2ft.-Community?The game has a fairly large community that usually fills a couple of the 100 player servers constantly with lots of smaller servers as well. However, the majority of those players have a kill on sight attitude. Youre not likely to make many friends you didn't bring with you.-Grouping?There is a basic group system which allows group chat and disables ""friendly fire."" There is no easy way to simply join and play with your friends. Due to the prementioned huge map and random spawning it's very likely that you will join a server and be near the people you actually want ro play with.-Pay to Win?Yes. The game is Buy to Play and Pay to Win. Supplies(food, water,bullets) are not easy to come by in game but for a couple of dollars you can easily stock up on what would other wise take several hours to gather if youre lucky.-Fun?Strange but Yes. The game is FAR from polished but if the stars align and you manage to meet up with your friend(s) on an low-medium populated server there is much fun to be had from the sandbox elements combined with lite PvP. -Recommend?I would recommend buying this game. On sale. Don't spend over $5. Sure it can be fun but it's the type of fun you would expect from a low budget indie game, which Infestation is not. There are just to many things wrong and the developers can not be trusted to give the game longevity or proper support(see War Inc.)			"

												This game after buying does a terrible job at trying to be something it isn't. I never have written a negative review before but this is a first. The mechanics themselves seem shoddy, appearences are bad, and the overall system is much to be desired. Respawn times on death (1 hr apart) and a microshop that promotes using it to survive make things only worse.			"

												This game would have so much potential, to be a very good zombie survival game. But the incompetence of the makers, or the lack of interest, leaves us an mediocre game, that has much PVP action, very little PVE (if at all), alot of bugs, a falty game mechanics to rage at and a reason to wish, that there would be a better zombie survival game someday.Nevertheless, the game gives a mild entertainment and can be enjoyable, when your playing it with your friends in a low population server.

												Ehmmmmmmm. How about just NO. I have spend about 2.5 hours just trying to connect to any server to play. After that i actually got in a server and played about 20 mins. First of all Im in Europe but the game decides I should connect to a US server in quick join. After I spawn in, I ran around in the woods for about 5 mins but there was not 1 zombie to be seen. As far as my experience goes, zombies are only in the towns. As I ran into a town, I encountered a zombie. The only thing they start you with is a flashlight and some food and banage. I spend about 2-3 mins punching the same zombie just to kill it. I have picked up a gun and tried to use it. There was no animation what so ever when you shoot it, it only bounds your screen up a little. This is the point when i decided to quit the game and say...... just NO. I would recommend staying as far away from this game as possible. But if you looking for the worst game I strongly recommend this.			"

												I played this before it came to steam and then a little after it released to steam. I CAN NOT recommend this game to anyone. I payed 20 bucks for their ""pioneer"" pack back when they were still in beta. I would suggest you stay away from this game and/or anything this company/developers make. The whole things feels like a cash grab. I was banned early on during the beta for no reason, I was using a tree for cover when someone killed me and said I was cheating.... I was banned shortly after. either way, there are MUCH better survivals out with DayZ and all the others that came out in 2016.To my knowledge no other survival game charges you to revive so you can play again after you die. I completely understand the microtransactions for cosmetics but if you're going to charge me to play after I died... no thanks.. feels like something from a mobile game (pay for energy to continue playing)just spend your money on something else, there are plenty of other survivals that are MUCH better			"

												I do not reccomend this game for two reasons: the gameplay and the community. Of course, the gameplay is fun for the first two weeks or so, and I'm still playing the game, but I must say, the game gets boring when you lag spike every minute and the game crashes every 5 minutes. Crashing is a huge huge downside of the game, you crash whenever youre killing a zombie or getting in a car and then you restart the game, and boom youre dead, and youve lost all the loot that you have earned for the past (well 5 minutes). A fair warning to those who buy this game: have a friend who owns a server, or get one yourself. DO NOT trust ANYONE on this game unless you know them. I say this because 99.9% of players will hunt you down and kill you without a thought. Once again, if you do get this game, rent a server or find a password for a server.			"

												It's a good game but it's not really survival. More PvP than PvE but there are also some strong zombies(for example: The Super Zombie - which you can find in a few places). And there is much to do in the open world. Simple and nice invetory interface.A lot of hackers since Punkbuster was removed but still funny.For only 5 Euros (3,70 on the official webside of ISS) it's worth it.			"

												I don't think it's actually possible to put into words just how bad this game actually is. It's laggy, boring, slow paced, boring, looks terrible, boring oh and did I mention boring? Nothing's more exciting than having your character move slower than your average snail across miles of open country to then finally get to something that isn't just trees, to then get shot by some random clown using an aimbot. Terrible, just awful. I wish the game devs had at least spit on it before they screwed me with this game, but like many other people, I've taken it dry and I aint happy.			"

												Grande ideia para um jogo. Você pega a sobrevivência zumbie do Mod ""DayZ"" do game Arma II, e transformá-lo em um MMO, onde você pode lutar contra outros jogadores ou até mesmo criar um grupo e limpar cidades e locais infestados de zumbies. No entanto, o desenvolvimento irrita seus fãs impacientes, por causa do seu desenvolvimento lento, a falta de informar a comunidade de mudanças, e não entregar certas promessas. Muitos jogadores afirmam que é apenas em versão beta do game, mas os desenvolvedores não conseguem fazer testes suficientes. Em vez disso, testam a jogabilidade sem usar o feedback da comunidade. Grande ideia e conceito, mas a má execução. Gostei de comprar este jogo pelo valor que paguei e não me arrependo, por causa de seu potencial.			"

												Totally NOT worth the $3.74 price tag, it's not even worthy of the $1.99 Daily deal that had passed. Infestation: Survivor Stories, or WarZ is a cheap recreation of DayZ that had been done in-order to try and leech off the successful sales of it's competitors. The game features very poorly worked on codes and excessive and frustrating, sometimes game-breaking glitches/bugs.Pros:1. Is a great way to work up a rage-enducing therapy.2. Can be gifted to someone you absolutely despise3. Relatively cheap, and can be used to farm some Steam XPCons:1. Excessive number of upseting, and game-breaking bugs/glitches2. Greedy Microtransaction system that requires you to either wait 20 minutes to play, or pay $5.00 to play then.3. Coding is poorly done, making it easily manipulated, and therefore a Security Risk.4. A developer whom worked on this game, also developed Big Rigs: Off the Road racing, google it.5. The entire game itself is a Scam.But don't just take my word for it, read the many other reviews for this game and look into this game, perhaps it may just pique your interest, although I greatly doubt that this game has a long life-span left.

												OK, so I started watching a few vid of Frankie on a Dayz mod of Arma 2.  Thought it was cool and bought the game, it was really hard to get on a server.  Then I found out about WARZ.  This was good because you could actually melee a zombie.  Then I found weapons and ammo and other goodies.  It was hard to find these items and everyone seemed to be paying before I did.  Ran into a few players and learned the hard way, not to trust people.  Later on I gave the benefit of a doubt and trust and got killed for it.  New maps vehicles added. and now Caliwood.  Over all, I like this game, it soothes my zombie craving.  I have to learn to be a better PVP player.  So used to console games not used to the PC style and controls.  I give this gamea  8 or of 10 .  With hackers on, I would give this game a 4 out of 10.   Get ride of these guys.  What's the point in aimbot?  where's the challenge?  I suck at PVP, but I don't cheat.			"

												Game Pros• Open world• Multiplayer• Grouping System• Looting• Day/Night Cycle• Vehicles (Ground only)Game Cons• Developers ignore community• Slow Spawning/loading times • Un-balanced map/loot• Horrible Optomization • Hackers/Script users• Un-Polished Character models• Broken PromisesRelateable Games• NetherConclusionInfestation: Survivor Stories turned out to be a let down. Sure, some people have fun. But the majority despises it. The only time I remember enjoying myself in it, was upon release, hence the 200+ hours I have in game from forever ago. In the beginning it had a lot of hope, but it's nothing but a deathmatch game now. Score20/100(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)			"

												I literally paid money for this game, just to have the devs shut down the servers, and create a f2p port for the servers...They took away a game I paid for, to let people play it for free, instead of just giving me a boost perk or something...I never had respect for the devs.			"

												This game will never be good, they dont develop and the patch notes are not what the people want to get fixed, it has the worst anti cheat so every 5 guys 4.5 are cheating, noclip its a real issue here, all the time you get noclipped and shot in the face. Artemis (The main developer) uses a twich account to make money from idiots who donate and the only thing he do while stream its banning people, cause they dont have an anti cheat that can do that auto.  I have at least 350 hours in my both accounts, and i will never play this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. Today, they have increased the ammout of money you have to pay to rent a server from U$S 30 to U$S 60 without telling anybody. I dont know why steam is kepping this game on his library, this game should be removed and ban Hammerpoint from steam 4ever and ever because this game will never be finished, and it will be worst with every patch note.I hope hammerpoint disband and Artemis unenployeed			"

												This game is a waste of money, on 60 or less ping server's the game lags has bugs, makes you pay more money to suck all the blood out of you because the zombies don't do it. The zombie's don't take hit registry's at all , even if you hit a zombie 20 times with an axe it doesn't die, it just kills you. This game is a waste of money I wish steam woudln't sell games like this, as I become very cuatouis when I buy any games now.			"

												They changed the name to limit confusion, I double checked it and is it WARZ. This was one of the worst game experience I have had in my life. Everything was terrible. I was tricked into buying this game with fake promises. There announce the game saying there was X amount of content, but it was a lie, which they later on refunded thounsands of players their money, after admiting that they lied and calling player 'misunderstanding' their description. This was a mess to play, you get killed by other human players that use aim-bots, terrible interface, glitchy, no function. I've played many games this is by far the worst one. If you dont believe me, you can either google the game or check other players review of this game. I say don't give this game a chance, its not worth your time. Hint: It's not a proper zombie game, more like start game - walk out - kill by auto aim bots.			"

												Everyone should buy this game. Not to necessarily install and play, but to own the worst mmo in the history of gaming. It would be safe to say this will remain the worst mmo in my entire life. The time and effort spent to make this game would have been better spent playing games to understand what might make one fun. It is a great concept, a mmo based around zombies, raiding other players for supplies. I believe if they reduced the respawn time,  and balance weapons such that anyone might have some kind of chance, the game could possibly be a little fun anyhow. graphic arent great, but would serve their purpose. It just comes down to promising to take your kids you disney world, but instead taking them mcdonalds playland. I am not even sure you would like it if it was the first and only game you have played. There are hugely epic mmos and great zombie games, and this is neither. I hope the two come together, forming survival parties, going through ruins looking for supplies and avoiding, or killing zombies would be lots of fun.			"

												The store page is about 110x more entertaining than the game. i mean 1.50$ but 60$ for in game currency? you ♥♥♥♥ing seriuos? no but in all reality the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ im not sure how you can mess up something with this much potential. oh wait thats how. all you need to do is add zombies that 4 hit you and it takes you about 30 hits (not exagerating) to kill them with most weapons.

												Putting the controversy aside, judging the game on its own merits, this is still not a good game. It suffers from poor controls, bugs, terrible AI and subpar graphics. Try getting into a car. If you get the opportunity, just try it. Have fun with that, because you're going to be there for a while. You have to look in a very exact spot, in the centre of the cars front, somewhere between the front seats. Then you have to run against the car, back and forth, grinding against its surface, until you've kind of glitched yourself into it. For a split second you'll get a prompt to enter, so you better be ready to press the button, provided you know which one you have to press. For minutes, you'll aproach the car from different angles, aim at different point of the car, grind yourself into it, climb it, hit it out of frustration, and missing button prompts. When you finally get in, you'll realise that cars in Infestation do not controll with WASD. They controll with the arrow keys. But this will not matter for long. As soon as you get to an elevated part of the road, you'll find it has collapsed. Now, you might think you might be able to make it to the other side if you charge at it at full speed. You won't. You see, if there is even the tiniest object in the way, your car can't pass it. See a gap between 2 cars you think you can easily fit through? You can't.After ultimately giving up on the car, you'll make your way into the city on foot, fighting a few zombies on the way (circle strafing is perhaps a more apropriate description. Fight would imply actual combat). Here you'll find the games strongest part. The worn down, flooded city I got to, actually looked pretty gorgeous. It was overgrown with vines, large gaping holes in buildings, and water covered streets. It is a shame that such a sight has to grace such a terrible game. Then you'll start asking yourself; ""did the zombies cause the flood?"" ""did they destroy the road?"" ""did they put the holes in the houses?"". Perhaps there's an answer to that in the game. But at that point, you're no longer playing the game. In fact, you've probably uninstalled the game at this point.You see, this game isn't just bad because of the controversy and the micro transactions. It isn't bad because of the unjustified bans during the beta. It isn't bad because it is a ripoff, or the promissed features missing from the game. It is bad because it is a bad game. It tries to be DayZ, but that is not the problem. The problem is that it doesn't commit to it like DayZ. DayZ is ruthless. It is hard. The axe is heavy, and can't be swung fast. Gear is hard to find, and is often located in dangerous areas. Infestation feels very light weight in comparison. You spawn with bandages, gear is everywhere, there are very few players to kill you, the zombies, while being able to take a lot of hits, provided you haven't found a weapon yet, are easily killed by just circling them. If they can't hit you, they don't provide a threat. Infestation doesn't have the lingering threat of injury, food poisoning, blood loss, hunger and dangerous encounters with players, and the stress that comes with those things. This is what makes DayZ great. It is the reason you can't make a ""DayZ lite"" for more casual players, because you lose what made it great in the process. DayZ may suffer from clunky controlls, but contrary to popular belief, the game itself is not clunky. When you get used to its controlls, it is smooth sailing from there. Smooth sailing with the constant threat of death blowing in the wind...Infestation is a game wich suffer from many problems. But more than anything, it suffers from the very fabric of its existance. The idea and concept it was build on. The game is a house built with poor features on unstable, flawed-by-design foundations. In the absence of DayZ's ruthless, unforgiving environment, Infestation provides nothing as a suitible replacement. It is a poor mimic, with watered down mechanics and nothing but superficial imitations of DayZ's ruthlessnes, with none of the weight. No matter what angle you aproach it, Infestation: Survivor Stories is a broken game, whether it be mechanically, by design or as an imitation. It doesn't hold up against DayZ, and it doesn't hold up on its own. All of this is made blatantly obvious in less than an hour of playing. Don't let the title fool you, it was, still is, and will always be the WarZ, and it still suffers from the same problems.			"

The zombie's don't take hit registry's at all , even if you hit a zombie 20 times with an axe it doesn't die, it just kills you. This game is a waste of money I wish steam woudln't sell games like this, as I become very cuatouis when I buy any games now.			"

												This game will never be good, they dont develop and the patch notes are not what the people want to get fixed, it has the worst anti cheat so every 5 guys 4.5 are cheating, noclip its a real issue here, all the time you get noclipped and shot in the face. Artemis (The main developer) uses a twich account to make money from idiots who donate and the only thing he do while stream its banning people, cause they dont have an anti cheat that can do that auto.  I have at least 350 hours in my both accounts, and i will never play this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. Today, they have increased the ammout of money you have to pay to rent a server from U$S 30 to U$S 60 without telling anybody. I dont know why steam is kepping this game on his library, this game should be removed and ban Hammerpoint from steam 4ever and ever because this game will never be finished, and it will be worst with every patch note.I hope hammerpoint disband and Artemis unenployeed			"

But not really.          Can play online... Sometimes          Tension in PvP... is the only emotion you'll have in this game besides anger and deception          Scavenging for loots...

												Best experience ever! I approached the supermarket, starving and willing to devour any scrap leftover. I noticed a granola bar, and I became filled with joy and relief. Suddenly, a floating construction hat came into view at the end of the aisle. I stared, wondering if I was going insane, or if my hunger was really this bad. The strange emptiness was holding something, a flashlight. It approached me, raised the flashlight, and brought it down on my head with titan- force, leaving nothing but bloody, bruised, and mushy flesh. I collapsed, embracing death's cold grip. The last thing I saw was that thing eating MY granola bar. 10/2 wuld bang.			"

												This game was so painfully bad, at one point the de velopers were basically paying you to play. The developers HATE the players. I don't mean that as in they made a bad game (though they did). I mean they literally hate the players. I once saw a developer pop into our private server, ban my buddy from the game just for saying ""wtf?"" and then type ""Lolz scrubs."" and then leave. That accound was never unbanned by support because they ""don't have the authority to remove bans from devs.""			"

												The zombie AI in this game is the most MOST horrible AI i have ever seen in any zombie game, takes too long to get to places, there are too many hackers that will kill you eventually where ever you go. The Devs clearly don't care about stopping the hackers or making the game any better as it has been out for almost 2 years and you'd think there'd actually be a bigger improvement but there's not. -100/10			"

												I do not reccomend this game for two reasons: the gameplay and the community. Of course, the gameplay is fun for the first two weeks or so, and I'm still playing the game, but I must say, the game gets boring when you lag spike every minute and the game crashes every 5 minutes. Crashing is a huge huge downside of the game, you crash whenever youre killing a zombie or getting in a car and then you restart the game, and boom youre dead, and youve lost all the loot that you have earned for the past (well 5 minutes). A fair warning to those who buy this game: have a friend who owns a server, or get one yourself. DO NOT trust ANYONE on this game unless you know them. I say this because 99.9% of players will hunt you down and kill you without a thought. Once again, if you do get this game, rent a server or find a password for a server.			"

												OK, so I started watching a few vid of Frankie on a Dayz mod of Arma 2.  Thought it was cool and bought the game, it was really hard to get on a server.  Then I found out about WARZ.  This was good because you could actually melee a zombie.  Then I found weapons and ammo and other goodies.  It was hard to find these items and everyone seemed to be paying before I did.  Ran into a few players and learned the hard way, not to trust people.  Later on I gave the benefit of a doubt and trust and got killed for it.  New maps vehicles added. and now Caliwood.  Over all, I like this game, it soothes my zombie craving.  I have to learn to be a better PVP player.  So used to console games not used to the PC style and controls.  I give this gamea  8 or of 10 .  With hackers on, I would give this game a 4 out of 10.   Get ride of these guys.  What's the point in aimbot?  where's the challenge?  I suck at PVP, but I don't cheat.			"

( im not joking ) The creators decided to ruin this game and start a new one insted... i wouldnt give this game to my worst enemy.. i hope you read this in time before you actually buy this game , if not i feel bad for you "

Sure, some people have fun. But the majority despises it. The only time I remember enjoying myself in it, was upon release, hence the 200+ hours I have in game from forever ago. In the beginning it had a lot of hope, but it's nothing but a deathmatch game now. Score20/100(If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)			"

Artemis (The main developer) uses a twich account to make money from idiots who donate and the only thing he do while stream its banning people, cause they dont have an anti cheat that can do that auto.  I have at least 350 hours in my both accounts, and i will never play this♥♥♥♥♥♥again. Today, they have increased the ammout of money you have to pay to rent a server from U$S 30 to U$S 60 without telling anybody.

												After logging on and playing for the first time, I tried to climb atop a bridge, but got stuck in between the cracks of the bridgeThen I was instantly banned for ""irregular movement"" in the game.After sending a stream, as evidence, and an email to support.I was sent an automated response email to notify me that customer support will not let my email go throughas my account had been reviewed and encountered evidence that I was ""cheating/hacking/ex[oiting""All within an when I was banned within 15 minutes of gameplay.I was given a permanent ban, with no support or appeal.After looking around youtube of people who also streamed their first time playing, there are countless others that are banned within their first time playing this game.DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEIT IS FULL OF GLITCHES AND BUGSNO CUSTOMER SUPPORT "

												Well, to all who like to play post apocalyptic, I recommend not buying the Infestation. The game is cool, hard to find food, weapons, but there is a thing called hack and this is, as we say, 50% of the players. Teleport, infinite bullets, super speed, among other things removes the desire to play. The game could have been good, but lacked improve the safety of the engine and the motor, locking it into a PC gamer, when played with everything on maximum.			"

												I don't see how anyone could hate this game... here are some pros:- The game only crashes every two hours- The game is a pay to win (gotta pay if you want to respawn, or you'll have to wait an hour)- The chances of you getting banned are totally random so there isn't much risk if you're a hacker- Almost half of your deaths can be from hackers- Your fps might drop if you go into cities, but who cares? the risk is worth finding a chemlight- With real money, you can buy any item you want from the in-game store- The loading screen is only 5-10 minutes long.- Last time i played, the hunger and thirst meters didn't even work, so don't worry about keeping them up.- ps hit me up if you want me to update the list with anymore information.

No single player mode like promised when the game was first advertised. I never encountered any zombies even after playing several hours.Until more is added to this game, promises are met by the publisher, the performance is optimized and all the glitches are fix I'd hold off. For what this game costs even on sale it's a ripout.			"

Product received for free
WarningI rewrote this after my intial review was missing. Prob due to the game changing names again. This game comes in many foul flavors such as WarZ, Infestation Surviver Stories (now classic wtf?), Romero's Aftermath (because WarZ/ISS was so bad lets do it again with less microtransactions), Infestation World (we couldn't even this this on Steam), Infestation The New Z (same game with improved business model), Shattered Skies (same game but in a space theme and no micro transactions), Last Man Standing (poor copy H1Z1 KotK and The Culling). All of these unfinished games use many of the same assets, and are on the same graphically handicapped engine. Some of the titles are almost exactly the same game.  Expect game breaking bugs, hackers, bad graphics, and poor performance. Pay MeThe game has the absolute worst micro transactions I have ever seen in a game. Pay real money to respawn... F*%@ no! Buy cosmetic items with real money just to be looted and taken by other players... WTF? Buy weapons and ammo with real money to kill the spawn camper when you pay me real money to respawn... Get the picture?  The last two titles (Shattered Skies and Last Man Standing) at least have done away with the micro transactions for the moment. ConclusionBe cautious of anything these guys develope/produce: OP Productions and Free Reign Entertainment, both companies founded by Sergey Titov, a man credited for making one of the worst games ever, Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing (2003).

			This is my first thoughts on Infestation after receiving it as a gift from Turtlemaw on Twitch TV. Thanks for the game. I just hope they make some very needed improvements.		





Aftermath - After I$$ (WarZ) 
A Video of Aftermath
By: Volt

			This is a video of Romero's Aftermath. The successor to Infestation: Survivor Stories formally known as WarZ. ISS had the worst business model I have ever seen in a game but Aftermath didn't fall too far from the tree.

Everyone and their grandmothers were playing DayZ! Let's make a game that capitalizes on that! Let's lie to our audience. Let's turn  guns and ammo into micro-transactions. Let's create no-kill zones with only on entry/exit point that people can camp outside of, killing people as the go outside.I'm proud to say that this game no longer tarnishes my Steam library with it's filth, as I personally contacted Steam support to have them permanently remove this game without a refund.These games are cancer.

And there is much to do in the open world. Simple and nice invetory interface.A lot of hackers since Punkbuster was removed but still funny.For only 5 Euros (3,70 on the official webside of ISS) it's worth it.			"

												I do not reccomend this game for two reasons: the gameplay and the community. Of course, the gameplay is fun for the first two weeks or so, and I'm still playing the game, but I must say, the game gets boring when you lag spike every minute and the game crashes every 5 minutes. Crashing is a huge huge downside of the game, you crash whenever youre killing a zombie or getting in a car and then you restart the game, and boom youre dead, and youve lost all the loot that you have earned for the past (well 5 minutes). A fair warning to those who buy this game: have a friend who owns a server, or get one yourself. DO NOT trust ANYONE on this game unless you know them. I say this because 99.9% of players will hunt you down and kill you without a thought. Once again, if you do get this game, rent a server or find a password for a server.			"

												Grande ideia para um jogo. Você pega a sobrevivência zumbie do Mod ""DayZ"" do game Arma II, e transformá-lo em um MMO, onde você pode lutar contra outros jogadores ou até mesmo criar um grupo e limpar cidades e locais infestados de zumbies. No entanto, o desenvolvimento irrita seus fãs impacientes, por causa do seu desenvolvimento lento, a falta de informar a comunidade de mudanças, e não entregar certas promessas. Muitos jogadores afirmam que é apenas em versão beta do game, mas os desenvolvedores não conseguem fazer testes suficientes. Em vez disso, testam a jogabilidade sem usar o feedback da comunidade. Grande ideia e conceito, mas a má execução. Gostei de comprar este jogo pelo valor que paguei e não me arrependo, por causa de seu potencial.			"

Ai is dumb, there is an outrageous number of hackers on this game, ammo is impossible to find, and stealth is broken. This game has it's scarce 1 of a kind moments when youre with friends, but you can have a better time by playing other games. So when you want to play a survival game, DO NOT think of this game. This is the bane of me. Also the amount of glitches are CRAZY. There are too many for me to point out. Just don't get this and wait for DayZ Standalone. Just awful. 2/10.Edit: They changed it's name to Infestation: Survivor Stories to make it seem like a different game. A very shady technique indeed. Because of their dishonesty I shall give it a new rating! 1/10.			"

												Only buy this game if you wont a money hungry non-survival game with hackers and VERY money hungry devs. This game is a new level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but if you want a game with action filled PVP this is maybe the game for you. This game is NOT a survival game anymore, its a Pay-To-Win in nearly all scenarios. After a while you will buy your first GC and then you will be addicted to the shortcuts this will give you. NEVER buy GC, DONT even think about it. Watch some gameplay before even thinking about buying this game.			"

												This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing bad. Now that is off of my chest I can review this game. Yes, it deserves the controversy. It shamelessly steals ideas from DayZ without trying to reinvent them. Ai is dumb, there is an outrageous number of hackers on this game, ammo is impossible to find, and stealth is broken. This game has it's scarce 1 of a kind moments when youre with friends, but you can have a better time by playing other games. So when you want to play a survival game, DO NOT think of this game. This is the bane of me. Also the amount of glitches are CRAZY. There are too many for me to point out. Just don't get this and wait for DayZ Standalone. Just awful. 2/10.Edit: They changed it's name to Infestation: Survivor Stories to make it seem like a different game. A very shady technique indeed. Because of their dishonesty I shall give it a new rating! 1/10.			"

												I purchased this game during a Steam Summer Sale since I couldn't get the DayZ mod to work on ARMA. Had over 200+ hours of play with this game and had a respectable cache of guns ammo backpacks rare items ect. Then my account was hacked and everything was stolen. Went through proper steps to contact support and hoping support could see my account was accessed from a different IP or something and possibly get my items restored. After 2 MONTHS of waiting on my ""pending"" ticket, I was told they wouldn't restore my items and was told something to the effect of ""all the items that were stolen from you are still available in-game for me to start over and restore what was stolen."" SO I'M SUPPOSED TO SPEND ANOTHER 200+ HOURS TO GET MY CACHE BACK??? ♥♥♥♥ THAT AND ♥♥♥♥ YOU customer support. I'm glad Reddit.com and Metecritic.com ripped you apart with their reviews. The game is fun and can be frustrating since it's a PvP which means everyone will KOS you even if you have no gear just to be a prick but dont expect any help from support if something goes wrong.

The absolute MOST HACKED GAMEPLAY of any game I've ever encountered.  Hammerpoint Software is a lame bunch of rip off artists.  This game is very lucky to received a metacritic score of 20.  It should be a 1.  The 1 rating would only be because the game exists.  Worst POS every made and sold.  The Bernie Madoff of games.  Can I possibly rag on it any more?

So heres how the game works:1) wait 50 hpurs for game to download2) buy sh*t loads of gold credits3) buy sh*t loads of weapons, apparel and bags4) create you charater5) try to join a server and get a bullsh*t message about the outdata being intailized before, or something about the map6) verify integrity of game cache7) downloads missing files8) repeat steps 1 through 7 for the rest of your life!This is the worst game I've ever played since my son made me play candy crush saga! this isn't game its a hobby of having to do so many bullsh*t routines!if you like having a game so you can say ""Yhea I've got that"" then buy or otherwise its 50 hours and 55 minutes of your life you'll never get back!!!!

												Poorly designed game, not worth it,Really wish I could get my money backWhen I started playing it I spawned in the middle of the wilderness and it litterally took me 20 minutes to make it out and actually do anything in the game, and at then I get killed instantly by another person, after that I could play my character for a set amount of time.Troll developers, troll plays, troll pricealso troll controls			"

												this game is really stupid. i have played it for a while to give it some chance and as far as i have seen the zombies are slightly overpowered. it takes an outrageous amount of melee strikes with a very sharp weapon like a hatchet or a katana to kill a single zombie. they should either be nerfed or the weapons need to do more damage upon hitting a zombie in the body. in real life you could hack a person to pieces with a katana in no time at all. as compared to a zombie with rotting flesh that takes way too many hits to kill.

												While it does *some* things different than the DayZ mod for ARMAII... meh.Save your money, look for a game that's trying more to do it own thing instead of duplicating a sparsely-functional mod.(I've had many, many fun hours with the DayZ mod - but this game seems too afraid to try to be original)			"

When you play this game you will get disconnected atleast 2-3 times every hour.Players also gets permbanned for no reason, when tough they don't cheat. You won't get any help with this. They just tell you to read their dumbass EULA which won't help you at all when you don't know WHY you get banned.Got to love their ""awesome"" customer support. DON'T BUY THIS GAME. You're better off playing Pacman or something else. Perhaps snakes on your old mobilephone.			"

												To save you from the trouble of paying for this, there is a free version available.From the beginning: This game was released as ""WarZ"" -more to the point of a DayZ ripoff. Now, DayZ started as a mod for ArmA 2: Operation Arrowhead. This game is stand-alone and tries hard to accomplish the same features but fail. You'll find more information here: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073411359/recommended/349700/This game was very disliked for having false information and missing features, until steam pulled it off the store.It was still being developed and soon put back here as Infestation: Survivor Stories.After a while, a free version also popped up called Romero's Aftermath. I'm not even sure they have the right's to that name!But search ""Romero's Aftermath on the store to play the free version, saves you the trouble and money.			"

												Updated as of the 6th of Feburary, 2015.I have recently replayed this game and although the situation has improved it is still scummy as ♥♥♥♥.Let's avoid the contraversies, and focus on the game first.Infestation : Survivor Stories or  ISS as it is known now is a Deathmatch. Simply put, everyone and everything wants you dead. You may be swayed by a ranking but good/bad ratings are completely useless and do not tell you if someone is about to slaughter you or not. Jumping to conclusions with Lawmen often gets you killed, at least Bandits you can spot from a mile away. There are no bonuses for either morality, which make it more of a ""How many bandits/bambis have you killed"" counter.The Zombies are actually a little bit more interesting than anything out thus far which to be fair is a compliment, there is an actual infection statistic and you can only cure yourself with vaccines which makes things interesting PVE wise. Super Zombies are infrequent but they do happen and you need to take a different approach to them, by gunning them down with alot of shotgun rounds. This game has alot of room for a PVE approach, alot more than anything else on the market currently.Unfortunately the game has a extremely heavy PVP focus, like so much PVP its actually insane. It is actually worse than DayZ or anything else. It doesn't matter what you have, just expect to get gunned down. To help yourself enjoy the game more, just gun down everybody with a weapon. Anyone with a melee weapon is to be dealt with at range and anyone with a gun on their back is a KOS. If you really don't care, gun down literally everyone but you won't earn my respect. (Not that you'll care.)The only way to avoid PVP in this game is to either join a server with no people on it or to buy a stupid amount of GC, buy a private server and regulate it 24 ♥♥♥♥ing 7. A DayZ Hive Private server didn't require such commitment, seriously. For what reason, we'll elaborate upon soon.There are a heavy variety of guns, an almost stupid amount. There are like 4 Machine Guns in the game, a ton of assault rifles, smgs, pistols and that isn't even including the melee weapons. It is a welcome variety from the fickle arsenals of other zombie sandbox games. There are an equally large amount of attachments and devices which to use with your weapons.  You can kit yourself in some standard armour and headwear but the military based stuff is a little limited in places. Your not going to find a ghillie suit if that is what you wanted. The game has its basic survival sandbox tropes, eating food and water, having constructable barricades and being able to make a fort in a stronghold server. Which you need to also pay GC for and i'll be elaborating upon this also.The gameplay is fun and that is the strangest thing. It isn't unplayable by any particular means, it is no less bland than any of the other zombie survival sandbox games. You'll enjoy leveling up your character and completing missions and killing zombies for your XP. The world, colorado in particular is not a well designed environment. If i was to praise H1Z1 for anything, its that you are never bored for too long and that you will at least run into something vaguely interesting as long as you are going in the right places. Sometimes Infestation feels like a grating experience from walking mile after mile to picking weapon after to weapon before you finally either turn tail back to the safe zone or get shot in the head by some remorseless player. The funny thing is that i don't blame people for being like that. Not at all.The game is designed as a hoarding game. You see, when players return to a safe zone they can store their gear. Now, unlike a game like World of Warcraft or Elder Scrolls Online you do not have a limit to the amount of weapons you can throw in there. Hell, you don't have a limit for ANYTHING. It becomes rather futile as you'll pick up like 5 of this SMG or a godzillian amounts of .22 rifles and then the issue becomes ammunition or what you don't have. Usually the sniper rifles and the rarer assault rifles and machine guns. (Blazer and Honey Badger in particular.) The easiest way to get those items are to just flat out go on a murder spree on everyone or kill a super zombie. Killing a player uses less ammo, and a super zombie takes upwards of 15 to 25 Shotgun rounds, and multiple clips of machine gun ammo. Which frankly is a farce. And the sky is ♥♥♥♥ing limit, so there is no reason to stop killing people because you never feel safe enough in servers to take out your sniper rifle or machine gun. So you'll take one from some other prat that has gone on a murderbonerific spree.Now back that up with the fact there is no actual backlash for going on a murder rampage and you have yourself a PVP slaughterhouse, with the occasional player trying to haul their stuff back to the safe zone only to have a bandit to jump out of the darkness and blow his brains out. That isn't even mentioning the amounts of script kiddies that go on Unknown Cheats or ♥♥♥♥, i don't know. The amounts of people crying babying on the forums is an obvious sign of that. It happened multiple times throughout the game's lifetime and ive never had to take a glance at all this♥♥♥♥♥♥from H1Z1 or hell even DayZ. Just stop reading if you expect a fair game, because this game is filled with people that have ESPs,Wallhacks, Aimbots. It used to be ALOT worse and it might seem like it has calmed down but Hackers are absolutely rampant on this game.You'd imagine there would be some sort of mechanic or hell a PVE only mode for servers with all this murder going on but here is what i am going to talk about. What you all wanted to hear from the moment you started reading this review.We all know of this game's horrific development cycle. Sergei Titov's antics with Kewk and whatnot. The fact that the developer of big rigs over the road racing oversaw this♥♥♥♥♥♥for most people is going to sound sirens and they absolutely 100% deserve to walk away from this one. The only people i would ever recommend this game to are people like me who are absolutely crazy about this genre for some obtuse reason or 13 year old kids who enjoy zombie games.The reason we can't have a PVE only mode? The reason why we can only create legitimate bases within Stronghold and not in the open world like DayZ or H1Z1? Hell, the reason why it is so expensive to maintain a server in this game?Money, they want to milk the hell out of this game and by lord have they already done it. I have to literally feel sorry for anyone that bothered to spend money on this game and that includes myself. I wish i didn't like this game's mechanics but i do have fun somewhat playing this game. In addition getting resales from people who want to make the most out of their subscriptions to hacking sites or as i like to call them, people with more money than common sense.Apparently they are making a sequel with a new team that actually gives a cow and although it sounds like a fresh start i think its too late and that the damage is already done.♥♥♥♥ Hammerpoint Interactive, ♥♥♥♥ Sergei Titov and ♥♥♥♥ this Game.The worst in 2012 and it continues to stink the ♥♥♥♥ out of every year that its been released.

												I never write reviews, but this time how can I not?I was pretty hyped about this game. Looked fun as hell.Me and my team mate get on to play and honestly if done right, it would be a very fun game.BUTIt is a load of caca instead.The game was made so poorly that even on low settings it will freeze and crash a good computer that can runall other games just fine.When you can get a computer to run it, the servers boot you off without warning every 2-5 minutes. Both of which make the game totally unplayable.Oh and if this game was every fixed, and made into the game it had potential to be, they need a better/more realistic looting system. & the weapons need to be more accurate especially the scopesand my fps ranged from 0 - 20 only! & the item descriptions need to be detailed properly (such as one backpack tells you how many slots it has, while another does not. all items are like that). so that needs to be worked on. Also the griefers are a bit ridiculous.but with all its really bad issues, thats the least of your worries!!!The Devs have obviously said a big F U to the players and I dont see this game ever being fixed. Thats really sad.So many games go this way these days. It has become so bad I am about to stop supporting indie games! How sad is that?			"

												Would be good if there were also PvE servers where you can just explore the world, fight zombies, collect loot etc. But it's just Call of Duty with zombies in the background. A lot of cheaters, scumbags who just shoot you in sight even if you have only small backpack and wrench, annoying crashes, and many other issues. It has a nice ambience and some potential though. I would recommend it only to those who seek another FPS and ruthless psychos who are satisfied by killing weaker players than them.6/10			"

												I bought this game a couple of years ago, it was then released as ""WarZ"".I was being a fool to myself, having too much hope and expectations for this game, don't blame me - the pictures looked great! It's quite a long time ago since I played this ""game"", and I wouldn't expect it to change much. As soon as the game was released and started getting bad reviews, the developers thought that it was a good call to change the name into something else, just to keep milking people's wallets... The game sucks and the developers are a disgrace. Do not buy this game!After getting the launcher up, I tried resetting my password, which I couldn't manage. The reasoning of this was the message I got when I entered the mail address that I knew as the correct one, but only got ""Message delivery failed..."" as a response.The folder that gets created when you install the game does still have the same old name: ""The War Z""TL;DR: I just bought this game, only to warn you not to. I didn't want to actually start the game, but I had to... Only to make this review... :(			"

												Would be good if there were also PvE servers where you can just explore the world, fight zombies, collect loot etc. But it's just Call of Duty with zombies in the background. A lot of cheaters, scumbags who just shoot you in sight even if you have only small backpack and wrench, annoying crashes, and many other issues. It has a nice ambience and some potential though. I would recommend it only to those who seek another FPS and ruthless psychos who are satisfied by killing weaker players than them.6/10			"

												My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because this game gave me cancer anyway.			"

												Have you ever wondered how a DayZ ripoff made by a greedy 12 year old with basic programming skills would look like?Well i guess it would kinda look like WarZ... um i mean Infestation: Survivor Stories!It's been a while since i played it tbh but back then (in the good old days) it was a mess. You run out of a save zone and if you're lucky and don't get shot directly outside of it's border you might get some loot. As soon as you find the loot you may want to bring some back to your stash or whatever they call it so you go back to the safe zone where 5 peole sit in the bushes and wait for your return. They probably didn't get their stuff from towns infested by buggy zombies. They may have bought it in the store for real money. Yes, there is a store for stuff. They don't sell weapons as far as i know but ammo, food, water, hats, and modifikations for the guns these ******* loot from your corpse.So you're dead. Congratulations. What now? Um, how about you pay some real money to resurrect your character? Or you spend the next few hours to repeat the same thing with a new character.I didn't mention the game mechanics did i? Well it's basically point and klick. You point on the head an klick. Sounds like a normal fps? Nope, most fps have some more complicated mechanics than that but if you don't like it you can still run around and beat other people with a flashlight because that's the most fun you can have in this game because it's not about surviving in a zombie apocalypse. It's about your wallet.0/10 because the CEO of Hammerpoint isn't in jailSmall Edit: 0.2 hrs because i played the non-steam-version.			"

												This game.. ugh.. really?This game.. is a scam.All it does is trying to get money out of you.And you buy gold credits with REAL money I repeat, REAAAAAL money to get more items.And as soon as you die you have to wait TOO long to revieve.But it's cool, yeah it's cool. 'cause ""AGAIN"" with real life money, you can reveive your character.And HE! guess what? You lost all your items.. THAT YOU PAID REAL MONEY FOR.And the biggest problem I have.. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, Is that Hammerpoint interactive said they would not do this.PvP in this game is dumb,simple 1 hit kill and you're dead.This game.. oh my god.. this game..It ripped off DayZ so badly..And dayZ was a great game! how come this game screwed it over so badly?But dispite all that..This game could've been a great game.It's just sad they focused more on the money than the concept.It's a terrible game and Hammerpoint should be ashamed of themselves.The fact that there's actually an option to buy in game points is so unfair for other players.And the best thing about those in game points?THEY'RE USELESS. ABSOLUTELY USELESS.You can't even buy guns with them, the most useful item in this whole game.Just some stupid swords that can barely defend you.Yeah great idea! people can just kill you in 1 shot and they could do nothing about it!I had 0 fun in this game.. 0 FUN.Going to other places in the game is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MESS!It takes ages and it isn't even rewarding once you get there..'Cause a lot of people are already to overpowered and kill you.AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AGAIN.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. this game..1/10 No potential.

												2/10This game is a cheap knock off of day z, complete waste of money. The game switched names soon after i bought it, all servers went down so nobody could play this game. Many of my friends and people i talked to online couldent get there money back haveing no ability to play the game not even getting a chance to ever try it. When i was in the game it was buggy, i dont know the current standing of this game but i would never want my money to go in there hands..5 Point: Game play.5 Point: Quality0 Point: Technical1 Point: Value0 Point: Fun2/10I rate the games I play out of 5 points of interest			"

												This game.. ugh.. really?This game.. is a scam.All it does is trying to get money out of you.And you buy gold credits with REAL money I repeat, REAAAAAL money to get more items.And as soon as you die you have to wait TOO long to revieve.But it's cool, yeah it's cool. 'cause ""AGAIN"" with real life money, you can reveive your character.And HE! guess what? You lost all your items.. THAT YOU PAID REAL MONEY FOR.And the biggest problem I have.. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM, Is that Hammerpoint interactive said they would not do this.PvP in this game is dumb,simple 1 hit kill and you're dead.This game.. oh my god.. this game..It ripped off DayZ so badly..And dayZ was a great game! how come this game screwed it over so badly?But dispite all that..This game could've been a great game.It's just sad they focused more on the money than the concept.It's a terrible game and Hammerpoint should be ashamed of themselves.The fact that there's actually an option to buy in game points is so unfair for other players.And the best thing about those in game points?THEY'RE USELESS. ABSOLUTELY USELESS.You can't even buy guns with them, the most useful item in this whole game.Just some stupid swords that can barely defend you.Yeah great idea! people can just kill you in 1 shot and they could do nothing about it!I had 0 fun in this game.. 0 FUN.Going to other places in the game is such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MESS!It takes ages and it isn't even rewarding once you get there..'Cause a lot of people are already to overpowered and kill you.AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING AGAIN.♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.. this game..1/10 No potential.

												Pros:-Graphically the game looks good.-Decent Loot in the game is fairly easy to achieve if you know where those spawns are.-The Dynamic Lighting looks great. (SweetFX makes it greater)-Fairly Decent sized open world. (but could use some more fillers to block out the dreaded walking)-Character Customization is neat. (but requires you to have to pay either GC or GD to unlock some which this serves as both a con and pro)-Finding a rare item can be exhilarating at times.-Loot Hoarding is always great. (This is one Key feature why I like Infestation most about)-Having your very own Unlimited GI .(Global Inventory)Cons:-Game has a lot of potential, Devs refuse to maximize that potential.-No matter what the devs tell you about this being a PVE based game is a lie and focuses towards PVP, very hard to keep the loot you find without some Jacka** killing you on sight.-Large FPS drops in certain areas as well as FPS hickups (This happens even on high end computers). Large cities that require a lot of rendering have a lot of FPS drops Campos on v2 being one.-Leveling is fairly slow-This game is pretty hard to play without some sort of GC start up fund as a new player to Infestation. Which I recommend getting at least one of the GC packs otherwise you'll have a hard time with no items in your GI. (Overall isn't fair to have to purchase more to the game to actually enjoy it)-Little options to lower resolution on lower end PC's.-Lots of bugs the community constantly complains about, but never get fixed in patches until far later.-Loads of Punkbuster issues with this game, Some Kicks, Some Temperary false bans, Others like myself getting Computer freezes/Lockups where a hard reset will only work.-People Being Falsely banned. (Supposidly, which really I think is because they have Keyloggers on their PC's)-Development in this game is pretty slow.-Things being promised, but never happen.-Customer Support is god awefully slow.-Developers make up pity excuses, whether it's based on your ban, features, implementations, etc.-False Advertising.-Very limited Zombie Models. (After a while of seeing the same NPC's they get stale real quick)-Animations are very limited and lack (Melee weapons Especially, Same animation over and over)-Lot of Hackers in this game that  have one goal, to kill you unfairly and steal your items and sell their account with your items and many other peoples items for a real profit.Overall:This game has a lot of potential, why the devs hold back, will never know. This game is getting better, but very slowly. The biggest issue in this game are the FPS problems. Owning an Nvidia Geforce GTX 470 GPU and an i7 CPU I should not be getting 5-10 FPS in Large cities, something isn't right. I can't say the devs are a scam, otherwise they'd stop further development of this game, but still doesnt make up the excuse why it's so slow in development. So would I recommend to buy this game? No, however it is enjoyable at times, but with the bugs and issues this game has as well as in the company, a lot needs to be changed before I can give a better review. So I'd wait for a better outcome on this game to be honest, if it gets that far. Don't get me wrong I play this a lot based on hours as you can see, it's just those enjoyable moments as I was saying is why I still play, and the Loot hoarding which is a special feature to have a GI while no other game has done (Besides Nether, but Nether is just as worse as this game don't know why people recommend it over this game I've seen Youtube reviews of the game that were just, bad).

												I bought this game a couple of years ago, it was then released as ""WarZ"".I was being a fool to myself, having too much hope and expectations for this game, don't blame me - the pictures looked great! It's quite a long time ago since I played this ""game"", and I wouldn't expect it to change much. As soon as the game was released and started getting bad reviews, the developers thought that it was a good call to change the name into something else, just to keep milking people's wallets... The game sucks and the developers are a disgrace. Do not buy this game!After getting the launcher up, I tried resetting my password, which I couldn't manage. The reasoning of this was the message I got when I entered the mail address that I knew as the correct one, but only got ""Message delivery failed..."" as a response.The folder that gets created when you install the game does still have the same old name: ""The War Z""TL;DR: I just bought this game, only to warn you not to. I didn't want to actually start the game, but I had to... Only to make this review... :(			"

												Well after months of playing the game and almost 1,600 cumulative hours (spanned over six accounts), and being very patient with the development of it - the last draw for me was the in-game lockboxes. Lockboxes are part of an integral part of the game in my opinion, especially if you're playing the game in PVE style, which is how I was playing the game with my family - hence the six accounts. The game has much potential for both PVP and PVE styles, and if you've followed the author's customer service track record, you'll find that they have no regard for their fan base - they claim otherwise. I submitted a ticket explaining my situation regarding a particular item (lockbox) that I've placed on my personal rented server ($50 month) of which I play the game in PVE with my friends and family. I personally stopped playing the game for a few weeks, but my wife and some friends have been playing on my private server continuously. Well, I came back in to find a wonderful surprise as I was looking for my 16 lockboxes I had left around the map weeks earlier. I could not find one single lockbox! I thought maybe because of my inactivity, the lockboxes might have been returned to my Global Inventory… nope, not the case.  Lockboxes can cost (at the author’s discretion), between 150 game credits up to (what I’ve seen) 750 game credits and I’ve got (had) a total of 21. My problem with the game is in the following; the authors can do changes to the game with little or no notice to the players, and if you try to look for help (as in their ingame experience) there is virtually none! You’ll find this a continuous problem with other players in their own forum. I’ll give you my own example: When you go and buy the lockboxes in their marketplace, there is no mention anywhere that the lockbox you are about to purchase can disappear if you place it in the map and leave it unattended for a period of time. Mind you, this information IS buried somewhere in their forum and you’re supposed to know that, because they make it a point when you first spawn in to figure these things out, and you’re an idiot for not doing so – as ArtemisKnives will let you know on his twitch.After 1,600 hours of ingame experience, I discovered that placed lockboxes do indeed disappear if you don’t access them in three weeks. You can be playing the game during that period, but if you don’t get your character to actually go to the place where you placed your lockbox and access the lockbox, it will disappear. Their reasoning behind this, so the map won’t be littered with lockboxes; makes very much sense in public servers, but remember I had these on my own private server, 6-10 people max. Anyhow, I found this out the hard way, not through ingame instructions or easily found on their forum, but after 1600 ingame hours later.I submitted the following ticket to get some help (I just about laughed myself to tears when I got their answer three days later) can anyone say automated?:My request ticket Feb 15 23:15""I came back into the game today after a months hiatus, I checked my private server's expiration time and I had 11 days left. So I just dropped another $50 to renew for another month in fear that I would lose my lockboxes and so that my wife could continue playing as well (we only PVE on this game).Anyhow, my heart dropped when I found all my lockboxes gone filled with my gear and survival items I've gathered over time for RPG'ng with my family (yes they have accounts and we play together on private). I really don't know what to do with this game, I had over 21 lockboxes distributed with my wife's, and rpg accounts. I only have two left. I have spent some considerable money on these and I don't care about the items in them, but I would like the boxes back, please help!""Their answerScarlet (Infestation Survivor Support)Feb 18 17:01""Hello Survivor,Thank you for contacting Infestation customer support!For lockbox issues, please ensure that you are on the correct server and location that you have placed your lockbox. When a lockbox is placed, it can only be accessed from the specific server it is placed on. We recommend always writing a note for yourself detailing the server and location you have placed a lockbox, as well as the password, as it is the responsibility of each player to keep track of their lockbox and password. Additionally, please keep in mind that lockboxes will despawn after three weeks if items are not taken from or added to the lockbox.Please also be aware that recently particularly crafty players have taken up safe-cracking to get at the loot stored inside, so you will want to make sure to select more difficult passwords and transport your favorite items to your GI for safe keeping!While you will not be receiving any reimbursement regarding this issue, we do apologize for the inconvenience and want to let you know that fortunately all items can be found in-game.Also, you can check out our forums (http://forums.infestationmmo.com/) for tips on finding items you may have lost, as well as our Twitter Page (https://twitter.com/infestationmmo) and our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/Infestationmmo) for future promotions and giveaways.We hope you have found this helpful and if you have any additional questions, please feel free to submit a new ticket and we will get back to you as soon as possible.Sincerely,Infestation Customer Support""In conclusion, if you want to throw your money at someone with terrible customer service, I totally recommend this game!

												Developers will ban you from their forums for legit critizism. They also do not come through with promises. I purchased this game when I was told I'd get a server for 6 months which never came to fruition. They are money grabbing a-holes, the game is riddled with hackers making it literally unplayable, and it's all based on microtransactions. Stay away.			"

												I had bought and played this before it's commercial release. I played it some more after that and it really still feels like it's in beta, unfinished. Not an enjoyable experience, many other games out there that are well worth your time. Save yourself time and money and skip this one. -Poorly optimized game engine (will run questionably even on the beefiest gamer rigs)-Rigid animations that lack refinement.-Uninspired level design-PVP at it's worst (good luck making any friends, might as well play COD)-No real depth to the survival mechanic, shoot or be shot.

												Not a good game.A good idea, but the developers used it as a cash grab.

												Poor game, worst development team I have ever encountered, even worse PR and a hell of a lot of lies. Pulled from Steam the same day it came to Steam. The hasn't been a lot of change to the game. Still feels like a mod of War Inc.Sergey Titov had a hand in this game who was also invovled in Big Rigs. So that say a lot about Infestation. If you don't know Big Rigs: Over The Road Racing. Look it up.The first time I heard about this game I was given the impression of a watered down DayZ.But even now through all the trouble the team is still slacking. I heard about a server in this game which was moded to bring some of the things that Hammerpoint promised such as cars. That was about a year ago now and Hammerpoint have only got around to testing cars now.This game maybe only £5.49 but you will get more value you out of burning your money I'd hate to say. It doesn't stop there the is also Microtransactions.Hackers, poor community, awful support and generally they want to take your money.Microtransaction are pretty much needed since you will quickly die by zombies. Although they shamble you sprint at a walking pace and jog at a snails pace. If you plan to fight the zombies you will either die of laughter by the horrible animations of when you hit them with your flashlight or die of boredom due to it taking so long.I won't lie it took me about 5-8 minutes of hitting a zombie over and over again.I suggest you save your money and look else where. The are other better games that do a similar job to Infestation.DayZState of DecayProject ZomboidThe Dead LingerI'm sure if you look around you will find something that will do the job.			"

But you can still only call it at most a Beta. By the end of 2013 they finally managed to throw in basic features of what the game was suppose to have a year ago. Glitchy, unoptimized and horrible AI at its best. It is trying to make income of mostly microtransactions, even if you are not required to use it, they designed the game so that it would be less frustrating if you pay more.The Meta score is no joke, this game is total♥♥♥♥♥♥  Amature devs with lack of skill and know how.

												This game is only recommended if you are willing to demote time to it, if not don't bother buying it. It's not the worse game, but certainly not the best. I recommend learning from youtube and experienced players on Twitch.tv as this game doesn't have a tutorial for new players which is one of the worse things I've found. Hackers are not much of an issue as hacks are getting detected faster, compared to earlier versions. The developers are still adding more stuff to this game and modifying it every few weeks to provide a better experience for players which varies from stat changing of items and adding new things in such as Super Zombies (beware) that are a lot stronger but drop loot such as rare assault rifles and sniper rifles. Due to the recent price change, it's more reasonable to get this decent quality game at such a low price. This game is mainly PvP based aswell, very few private servers provide PvE with enforcement of the rule, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but makes somethings a lot easier and more fun so it's best to travel in a group (only with friends, as randoms will just get your location and kill you)Pros:-Multiple spawn points to prevent risk of spawn killing along with spawn protection-Looting for meds, food, or weapons is easier than before-Vehicles have been added for faster transportation-Large map to get loot and stay away from players-Variety of servers for players who perfer small servers or very populated ones-Safe zones are found throughout the map to allow players to store items and prevent loss of them-Zombies can drop up to $10,000 (very rare) but they drop $25-$50 almost every drop, which can be used in the store at safe zones and can be farmed very easily-Developers have made a youtube page to help out players with tips (players have some too)Cons:-Hackers are commonly found on official servers-Good weapons are found at places with super zombies or cities with mass pvp-Super Zombies are nearly impossible to kill if you're new (they die easily from semi-auto shotguns)-Vehicles are destroyed easily as physics don't include a form of suspension (roads lead to cities but none of them can be drove through as vehicles and other debris that prevent you from going through them)-Players have a 95 percent chance of killing you if you encounter them (there are ways of getting out of these situations)-It's very hard to start from scratch if you're new to this game (recommend playing in a group)-Players in vehicles can instantly kill you if you're not in a safezone7/10			"

												The game in itself is not horrible, but it's still pretty bad. The trailers and screenshots are edited to make the game look nice. Half the time the game is glitched or broken, and the world is full of hackers and spawncampers. The game is full of microtransactions which can all be lost seconds after outfitting your character to some random person who found a gun. There hasn't been a real update since the games release, and the developers are obviously just taking what money they can from a broken game and running away with it. Overall, the only good thing about this game is that the few times it does work, it's like a seriously downgraded DayZ. 2/10, would not reccomend to anyone.			"

												Its seriously not as bad as people make it out to be. The only reason this game gets a bad rep is because total biscuit made a negative review about it during the ALPHA stage and his fanbois must spread his opinion as if it is their own. I almost didnt buy the game because of negative reviews but i am glad it didnt stop me. The game is really quite fun and very populated. Yes it does have an ingame cash shop but its kind of ironic in that people go spend a bunch of money and you kill them with a pistol you found and take it all.This was the first DayZ clone (that i know of) The first clone games always get a bad rep, and with a popular negative video review on top of that it just makes people get off on putting down on this game. Its stupid really.Overall, if you like zombie survival, open world pvp, and full loot type games, this is up your alley.			"

												Pros -1) Huge open world2) The Metascore doesn't lie, it really is worth 20/100Cons -1) Because the world is so big, it takes you hours to travel from one side of the map to the other...2) DayZ rip-off3) Hackers4) You have to pay to revive your character if they die, or you have to wait 24 hours to start playing again..5) You'll likely get killed within 20 minutes. Whether it be laggy zombies killing you, or other players who shoot on sight6) Doesn't look anything like in the screenshots7) You have to pay for literally everything, because you can't fight for sh*t with the flashlight you get, and finding a good weapon is very hard.

												Don't waste your money. This game used to be called The War Z, and recieved such bad reviews and bad press that the developers changed the name and went back to steam. For some reason Valve hasn't removed these scammers from their storefront, and refused to give me a refund despite the blatant false advertisementes all over there store page. Don't waste your money.			"

												This game is complete trash, do not even consider it.  And the metacritic score is 20, which is the lowest I have seen for any game ever.  I cant even get into a server, and when I do, the game feels like Team Deathmatch instead of trying to survive.  The zombie animations are also really really bad and they sound terrible.			"

												Pros -1) Huge open world2) The Metascore doesn't lie, it really is worth 20/100Cons -1) Because the world is so big, it takes you hours to travel from one side of the map to the other...2) DayZ rip-off3) Hackers4) You have to pay to revive your character if they die, or you have to wait 24 hours to start playing again..5) You'll likely get killed within 20 minutes. Whether it be laggy zombies killing you, or other players who shoot on sight6) Doesn't look anything like in the screenshots7) You have to pay for literally everything, because you can't fight for sh*t with the flashlight you get, and finding a good weapon is very hard.

												Unless you can get it for under 0.50$ like I did, don't buy it, it's just that bad, if you want other zombie survival games just google that, ANYTHING that comes up is better.Update: So I've retried this game and to tell you truth it has improved a lot, in all aspects of the game, it finaly contains nearly all features that they had claimed the v1.0 had...So right about now it's a good game to buy if you're in it for a game to play with your mates.Can't really change to recommend it because of how the game came to light of the gaming world but if you're in it just for some friendly fun with few pals wait a while(usualy not long) for a sale to go on which will range about from 50-75% and buy the game then go right ahead and die due to one of teammates fooling around :)			"

												Infestation: Survivor Stories was a good attempt at an open world zombie survival game. Unfortunately this game has plenty of room for improvement. The biggest issue lies in the PvP system. While the addition of a PvP system does improve the realistic feel of the game, making it more like AMC's ""The Walking Dead"", the lack of any kind of radar or threat detection system makes detecting potential threats impossible. Making a seperate server list that allows for players who are new to the game to learn the play-style and get their basics down would vastly improve gameplay.The inventory/store system could be described as the worst in gameing, period. Lets start with the general store, the items are hideously overpriced. (an example being a candy bar, which is a beginer item and critical to survival, costs over $300. This doesn't seem like much untill you look at the average amount of money droped by zombies in game. This amount ranges from ~ $24 to $57 and on top of that the ratio for a money drop is about 1 in 3 (possibly less) This means that in order to afford even the most basic of items a player must grind for hours, possibly days (a process that gets real old real fast). In addition to scarce money drops and expensive items the general store lacks any kind of item selling which just makes getting enough money to buy what you need to survive even harder and un-apealing.Next is the inventory system. Which is pretty basic with quick slots for food and medkits, dedicated primary and secondary weapon paces and backpacks of different sizes allowing for more carrying space. There is nothing wrong with this sytem. The issue lies in what occurs when a player is defeated. Upon death ALL carried items are lost equiped or not. This means that you could've spent hours gathering items and if you die at any point you will lose all your items with an extreemly low chance of getting them back. This penalty is coupled with a 16 minute respawn time per character (unless you are willing to spend real money for an imediate revive).			"

												I saw this game on sale and bought it for 1,49 euro with money I earned from selling CS:GO weapon crates, so I thought...what the hell, lets see if it deserves all the hate it´s gotten.I got in trouble immideately with either spawn campers or other players a within two kilometers from my spawn location and died three times within 20 minutes. This sucks major time since you have to wait for a timer to cool off before being able to play on your character again, and theres about a 7 character limit in the game!!!The game is really unbalanced in the early survivor spawn stages since you can freaking buy weapons/ammo/health/About-Everything-You-Need with real money, in the menu before and after you have spawned your survivor.I finally had it with this turd when I finally got a sawed off shotgun and a zombie attacked me. It stood right in front of me, I pulled of two gutshots from only a few centimeters distance...but the zombie survived that and killed me.After that, I quit the game and uninstalled it, never to return to this sorry excuse for a game, ever againPlaytime: about 40 minutes, before I had it			"

												 I love this game, a huge part of me want to root for it. The hacking has become out of control, no punkbuster, only fair fight which makes you have to report them yourself. Esp is so common place ( players can see your location and position on the map they will hunt you down in 2-4 people groups all day). I never thought I would give this game which has been amazing and a blast at times a negative review. I would love to change it once they actually take the time to employ a legit anti-hacking program.			"

												I would not recomend this game. It is the most obvious ripoff of DayZ I have ever seen, and you have to buy weapon with real money, since the guns are pretty much unexistent, (did I spell that right? XD) , All in all, DayZ, 7 Days to Die, and Rust, are easily the best zombie games in this genre. I have seen videos of this game, and its obvious they bought the guns because everyone in the game other than them has a flashlight (starting weapon -_-) which you have to hit a zombie for 15 hits to kill them, and for a player, its 25.                                          I rest my case.			"

Segundo la optimizacion es malisima, como es posible que un juego con esos graficos me vaya a 30 fps y juegos HAWKEN o World of Tanks me vayan a 50 - 60.Despues el tipico P2W(paytowin). Cuando empezó este juego dijeron de que este juego no iba a ser P2W, que solo tendria unas cuantas de cosas en el mercado y eso.... pero esas cosas se han convertido en todo lo esencia y metiendo 100€ te compras un monton de chalecos antibalas y eres invencible. Eso da al siguiente punto:El balance de armas es lo peor que he visto. Como es posible que tengas que gastar 3 cargadores con la mayoria de las armas para matar (teniendo en cuenta que los cargadores son escasos (pero tranquilo que si metes 100€ en el juego ya no te seran escasos)) y que las armas tiene durabilidad (durabilidad que se gasta a los 7 u 8 cargadores). Sin embargo las mejores armas solo matan de medio cargador.Podria decir más, pero es que este juego no se merece ni que escriba un analisis.			"

												Ok after playing this game for 300+ hours i came up with what i have to say about this game. First of all its great fun with friends but not really by yourself. 2 from time to time you'll encounter hackers (esp,aimbot,etc) and thats just somthing you have to get over when you play this game. but if you're looking for a real realistic survial game then go with something like dayz  so while reading all these comments your going to see negitve,negitve but odly i cant give it that rateing just becuase of all the good times i had with my friends and other players in game. So hope this helped you choose a game ;D PEACE!			"
