												Driving a party of survivors to safety across a zombies infested town? On paper this was a very good game, absolute lack of proper support killed it though. I rooted for the devs while they were on Steam Greenlight as they appeared tireless and dedicated to the players, as soon as they got greenlit and got the money though they practically abandoned support and left the game in an unfinished state.I'll post the dates to make it clearer:September, 7 - 2013 - Steam ReleaseOctober, 23 - 2013 - Last Patch Released & End of SupportNow, while I understand after-sales support cannot last forever, 45 days of support before shutting down a game is definitely too low. Grab this game *only* if it is in a bundle if you like the genre or if you would like to see what a good game this one could have been.They responded to the critics by mentioning they were working on a new, shiny game. They got me once, they won't get me twice.+ Cool Idea for a game+ Convincing Audio+ Customizable+ Fun, for a hour or so- Never Properly Supported- Development Halted- Certainly Not Worth a Premium Price4/10			"

												A diary style game where you fight zombies, bar up houses, and try to survive while accomplishing missions?Sounds great!Being able to bring my own friends into it? Even better!So what's the problem? It's random, and some of it just doesn't make any sense at all. You can take a group of people out into a horde of zombies fight twenty times in a row and never get scratched. And on the tewnty first time your entire team can die.You can clear out a building, barracade it completly, fill it with traps and then move to another building to go exploring. Your boobytrapped fortress will be full of zombies.I liked the diary aspect, I liked a lot of the concepts, but the game isn't very clear on what items do, or what anything means. I could never tell if I had a good chance or no chance at all of accomplishing a goal. I don't know what items were better to bring along or leave behind.Even cheating I got my butt handed to me even though my entire team had been at full life up until that point.The game has potential, and I know some people like it, but it's too random for my tastes.

												This game provides an interesting ""choose your own adventure"" setting to the zombie world. The game plays out in three different modes (""Sandbox"", Goal with no time limit, strict time limit) and puts you in charge of a group of survivors. You'll need to give these survivors orders and plan carefully to win. All the action is communicated through diary entries which makes the game most of a create your own story.I especially like how the game pushes the relationships as a key element as most zombie games miss this. However, sometimes they seem to hate eachother just because but it's an interesting element.This game isn't going to appeal to everyone but anyone that doesn't mind using their imagination and loves the Zombie genre will definitely like this game. It's very challenging but be warned there's a lot of randomness to it and you may lose just because the game decides it.Genre Lovers: Must BuyNon-Genre Lovers: Skip itTime to Beat: Each game takes about 1-2 hours but there's tons of replay value as every game plays out differently.Oh and you can import your own survivors which makes it more fun.

												I want to like this game, I really do. It has a great 'board game' feel to it and it has all the components for a good game. Unfortunately, it breaks down pretty quickly once you start playing. First off, you can't assign people equipment unless they're moving to a location. I can have the greatest gear in the world, loaded up with a fire axe, motorcycle clothing, and even guns, but my patrolling people will still go outside naked with a pocket knife and then complain about getting mauled. The gear they will use seems to be pretty random too, as survivors just grab whatever they feel like when they need it. Did a zombie break in? Well, let's just shoot it with the irreplaceable crossbow bolts instead of using the silenced pistol with a million rounds of ammo, or the perfectly good fire axe. The will use armor on defense, but only against zombies.""Who else might attack them"", you might wonder. Well, how about your psychopathic survivors? Every. Single. One. Is a psychopath, one bad mood away from murdering someone in cold blood. I don't know if it's a bug or if this game is in KKK central, but murderously racist characters are the most common characters around. There's also a lot of class division, and any and all quarrels are solved by violence. They'll even interrupt important jobs just so that they can wound each other, and then have the gall to be upset when the corpse pile they were supposed to dump came back to life to attack them. And this isn't because they're cooped up too long in one place, they'll start up this garbage the second they're left in the same building. Maybe it's social commentary about what the makers think would happen if you could murder people without police involvement, but given that even the former police officers in this game are cold blooded killers, I really can't say. With all this hostility to work around, your best bet is to separate your characters into two or three groups. This would work great, if it weren't for the fact that the zombies are psychically drawn to your survivors. If you barricade fast you can fight a losing battle to keep them out, but having to juggle two or three groups will result in stupid injuries (due to refusal to use logical equipment) and inevitable break-ins (since you rarely have two survivors in the same place to watch each other's backs). With all of these negatives noted however, if you can get a pair or more of survivors in the same place without anyone killing one another, you can actually see some of the potential shine through. There was some serious promise in this game, and if you could assign equipment to people then I would actually recommend this game. Because you can't, you'll get buried underneath the inevitable endless horde of psychic zombies who will wear your stupid naked survivors down until you lose, as you can't really expand or explore when you're having to constantly stay on the defensive. If they ever patch out the insane, murderous survivors so that you could have a proper party together, I'd recommend this game. Since they seem to have abandoned the title though, I'd recommend you play something else. This is definitely not worth $10.Too long, didn't read: Insane survivors who kill each other at the drop of a hat combined with a lack of an inventory system make this a bust. There's better games out there for $10.			"

												The premise of Zafehouse Diaries is pretty straightforward: Guide a group of five survivors through a zombie apocalypse and attempt to escape the neighborhood.As you can probably tell from the screenshots, everything in the game is represented through journal entries, photographs, and a few miscellaneous objects used to represent the characters on the map (bottle caps, pennies, etc). This presentation allows you to use your imagination to fill in the blanks, and is overall fairly effective.The real problems begin once you start advancing through the game. Let's talk about some of the more frustrating mechanics that make the game so hard to enjoy: Each character is assigned a random occupation when you create a new game. This means that sometimes you'll get a great group of survivors with a lot of varied skills, but sometimes you'll end up with a group full of people who have no useful skills at all. You might say that's realistic, and you might be right, but all it really does is encourage you to start over, which brings us to the next (and BIGGEST problem): Survivors hate each other. I mean, they really want to kill each other. No matter what. When you start the game, you can immediately check the compatibility of the group through a nice little color-coded status screen that shows you how everyone feels about each other. However, these feelings are purely based on race, gender, and social class. There isn't really any way to change these feelings, either. Random events and rumors can cause a temporary boost in their relationships, but someone will eventually make a rude remark for no reason, and then you're back where you started. No matter what happens, you will get two or three people who hate the other members of their group for being a different race, a different gender, or a different social class. This means that the only way for everyone to get along is to have a group of people who are all identical (5 rich white girls, for example). BUT, even IF you were to create a custom party of rich white girls, it wouldn't matter, because random events cause everyone to hate each other anyway. ""Someone else took a shower when I wanted to take a shower! I hate them now.""""You beat me at chess! We are now mortal enemies.""""Nobody wants to play cards with me! I hate everyone in the house!!!"" This gets VERY tedious, because it affects how well the survivors work together, which is an absolute requirement to succeed in this game. Zombies know where you are even if you make no noise and never leave the house, and the horde becomes increasingly larger and more aggressive as the game progresses. Despite the fact that you can fortify a location into a badass stronghold, it's not worth the time because you'll eventually be overrun no matter how many precautions you take. You can't control how your survivors use equipment. They seem to just randomly use the best tool/weapon available at their current location. You can't give someone a gun or a baseball bat and have them just carry it around. No. You need to check the inventory of the location they're at, and make sure that something useful is in the list of things available there. Half the time, the survivors pick something inferior from the list and get themselves hurt or killed, though. Combat is just a bunch of random rolls, and you have no strategic control over what occurs. Your survivors act completely independently, and their relationship to one another is the deciding factor in whether or not they fight together (which they never do, because they hate each other).If some of these problems balanced out, the game might be a bit more enjoyable. As it is, you might find the game interesting for a few hours if you can purchase it on sale, but there's little to keep you playing beyond that point.			"

												My main reason for not recommending this game is that when the development had officially stopped i felt like i was scammed out of my money by the devs abusing the EA system.I ended up being frustrated, because I got dragged into an addictive game, that in its finished state looks like an alpha test.Character managementThe most important thing you have to keep your eyes out for in tis game are character relations.If your group members hate each other there will be no way you can succeed because they will fight among themselves like they are on angel dust.To stop that from happening you create rumors about certain group members (???) and the entire group reacts to it in certain ways.For example : One in your group is homosexual and that other black dude really hates him because of it.To make their relations better you need to spread a rumor about the former that he was acused of crime against a homosexual. Does that sound logical to you? Inventory systemManagement of the inventory is implemented so horibly here, when I belive it should have been the center of devs attention.You cant chose which survivor should equip a specific item. Get used to seeing a janitor with a broken arm charge in with a butter knife while an armored full health bartender unloads all his ammo on two zombies and barely wounding them.Difficulty This game is unbeatable,or at least you wont care enough to give it that much tries to prove me wrong.Trust me,with all the RNG in this game it'll take you around 20 attempts to even start making progress. Zombie numbers increase constantly,you cant abandon breaching buildings (and end up storming infested ones without any reliable option to scout it or reduce zombie numbers). Its a TEXT-BASED GAME.How hard can it be to just finish it? Instead you get a bunch of fanboys telling you garbage like ""In before times there were no patches for games after they were out!!!!"" or ""You can mod using mods from THIS or THAT dead website!""Overall a very punishing expirience. 3/10			"

												If five racists die after spending 3 hours fighting with each other, does anyone give a♥♥♥♥♥♥ This is the question posed by ZafeHouse Diaries as you are placed in charge of guiding a group of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to safety in the midst of a zombie apocalypse.Zafehouse: Diaries certainly had potential and is enjoyable at times but the game is bogged down by questionable design choices and clunky in-game mechanics. Add onto this the fact is that there are now better games available that offer a much more fun experience like Rebuild. The game IS a lot more enjoyable if you import your own characters into the game, since this is the only way you'll be able to inject any sort of likeability into your survivors. I mean, who wouldn't want to see if Hulk Hogan, Pope Francis and Wolverine can survive the apocalypse? However, doing this disables acheivements, so you'll be s.o.l. if you want to form an emotional attachment to the default group. The default group and their biases are randomized, and you'll be stuck with a random racists, homophobes, bigots and sexists. As you can probably imagine, this doesn't exactly endear them to the player right off the bat. Add in the virtually non-existant character development that occurs throughout the game, injury debuffs that never seem to go away and a penchant for NEVER coming through in the clutch and you will still not care about them when your survivors all die after playing for an hour. At the start, you have to try and effectively manage everyone by both playing to their strengths and avoiding conflict with each other. However, one well planned rumour can make your life a lot easier and it's entirely possible to get everyone to like each other by the end of the second day. However, conflicts will still happen on rare occasions and your survivors will get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off about inane♥♥♥♥♥♥like having to wait to take a shower or not having anyone play chess with them.Dora from JayIsgames put it best when she said, ""You have nothing to go on other than the simple formula of incompatible traits, and it feels less like tempers reaching a boiling point and more like a bunch of variables behind a computer screen flipping you the bird."" Sadly, this ""bunch of variables flipping you the bird"" is not limited to the relationships aspect of the game.			"

Thriller with great T as it should, you can´t expect what´s gonna happen and this keep level of tension very high. You manage group of people, giving them orders and goal of this game is simple: survive as long as you can, everytime you start the game, you get different people with different experiences in different places. Manage them to survive and watch out for their relations. Everything they do is written in diary, so you can think, what to do in next turn 9/10			"

												Personal Rating: Good Ideas, Not So Fine ImplementationClassic Rating: ★★★☆☆EDIT: After spending a while more time playing Zafehouse, I'm loving it!First of all I liked ""Zafehouse: Diaries"" so far (I haven't played so much) but it surely could be improved in several aspects:● Random characters generation can get you 5 people almost all without any skill: in my second playthrough 2 women couldn't even prepare a meal, let's not talk about making traps..● Relations are the weakest point in the game, IMHO. After 8 (ingame) hours gameplay (basically 8 turns) all the survivors got angry at each other and the ""spreading rumors"" feature which should be used to consolidate those relations was pretty much useless: can be used one time every 24hrs and it's not really effective.● This is a text adventure game, I would expect some translations, also considering that most of the messages repeat themselves as soon as in 2 hours gameplay.● Lack of a proper resolution.● Price is too high: 10€ at the time of this writing.I do not want to penalize Zafehouse's developers (rating down their game) because it is original and enjoyable but I would not recommend buying it at full price; trade it with somebody (like I did) or wait for a bundle.

												Game: Zafehouse DiariesSummary: Plays like Rebuild, not for everybodyRating (5/10 = failure): 8Multiplayer: NoCompletion: 10 hrsCards: NoCloud: NoCost: ~0.5 USD bundledZafehouse is a fascinating game (to me). Those that have played the excellent Flash game, Rebuild, will get the basic idea - you have a small group of survivors and you spend turns trying to survive and win. Standing in your way are ever-increasing hordes of zombies (depicted with their dazzling animation of... a still-frame blood splatter) and your survivors who snap at each other because of their race, gender, and music-playing.All games are randomly generated. With three modes of gameplay, the replay value is good. Be prepared to lose the first few games, as there is a lot to absorb, and the fact that your survivors are ravenously hungry, fragile and dumb. With the default settings, the game is indeed quite difficult, but learning what's worth the risk and what isn't is part of the fun.The interface is rather minimalistic. As best I can tell there are less than 10 screens in the whole game! For the most part it does its job. For a good few hours I didn't know how to breach or assault a place because there's no tutorial and I didn't know you could click on the tabs up top on the investigation screen. There's an online manual, but who clicks on that?The ability to customize your own survivors with your own photos is a nice touch. I appreciate that a lot, as I was a lot more connected to the survivors with my own pictures. You can also create custom jobs, but this is very easy to abuse and makes the game far too easy if used (and consequently disables achievements). Speaking of achievements, even though I disabled all custom content, I was still unable to get any achievements, so I don't know what's going on there.All your actions are recorded in a ""diary"" that can be saved upon game completion, but honestly, those records strike me as... uninteresting. I don't care to reexamine my escapades, nor would I want to read someone else's. It's not a bad feature, but it just feels... I dunno, wasted?Overall I had a good experience. I'm giving it an 8/10, knocking points for its almost lazy interface, occasional events with no positive outcome, and incredibly dumb survivors in a life-or-death situation. The big question is, is it fun? Even after completion, I went back to play it some more. That's not something I can say for many games these days.			"

												At first, it is easy to feel overwhelmed by this game. Agressor dilemmas are perhaps a little more regular than you'd like, and its easy for your group to fall apart as a result of arguments and disputes. However, when you actually get into this game and develop a strategy, the majority of these things are either avoidable or fixable with a little effort.Whilst there are plenty of FPS zombie games around (dear lord, someone make it stop), survival and reclaiming games such as this or Rebuild 3 are rarer. This game is very clever in forcing you to depend on not just your supplies but also the status of the members in your group to stay alive, providing a much more realistic post-apocalypse survival experience.  Of course, your group is varied every time in terms of background, age, gender, sexual preference, fitness and abailities, and with a randomly genereated map each game, no playing experience is like the one before.  This variability gives the game an epic amount of replayability and - should you complete the three main campaigns - the game has an easy to use in-game  custom content creator. Want to survive the apocalypse with your friends or the characters from your favourite TV show? Go ahead! Add pictures, careers, skills and personal abilities to your custom characters, playable in an endless sandbox game or on the campaigns.Many reviews on here will complain that the group argues too much which causes everything to fall apart - cook a large meal and everyone will get along. Don't have enough food for a large meal? Break into a store. Dont have the weaponry to break into a store? Modify your weapons to create spiked bats and double barreled hand guns so that you CAN breach the store. Create a stronghold at the police station, steal medical supplies from the hospital. THIS. IS. A . STRATEGY. GAME. You can't just expect everything to go dandy, This game is a challenge, and I love that. It has a stand out format with a fresh new style and thoughtful gameplay. I couldn't recommend it more.			"

												I could swear I've seen this exact game as a Facebook app title a few years back... Anyway, in Zafehouse: Diaries, you are tasked with guiding a band of sniveling, hateful survivors into scavenging and sneaking their way through a zombie-infested town in search of supplies, ammunition, and scrap with which to barricade out the onslaught of hungry dead. Hide too long without taking up arms and you'll have an undead army on your hands, but make too much noise blasting the dead and you'll just draw the entire town population right on you. Unfortunately, your survivors are pretty small-minded; each comes with a particular sort of person they just really cannot abide, be it a racial group, sexual orientation, or gender. Keep the party together too long and the petty annoyances will eventually erupt into inter-party combat; split the party too thin and you'll fall prey to Zed in short order. Although you get only a general management degree of control over your team (go search this building, hunt zombies around this area, whip up some vittles, etc.), there is a healthy variety of tasks you can set your party to, and careful decision-making will go a long way toward keeping your merry band together.Along with the basic sandbox style of gameplay in which you must gather survivors up and avoid death for as long as possible, there are also two more difficult challenge modes available. In one, you must restore a car to working order and hightail it out of town, and in the other you must simply survive for a week. Both of these modes crank up the difficulty tremendously, and once you've learned how to eke a modicum of survival out of your hateful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, they're fun (in a horribly aggravating sort of way).Unfortunately, the game falls apart a bit in the area it seems most proud of. The eponymous ""DIARIES"" it shouts about are the prosey bits of horror the game uses to let you know how your team is doing. This is written in the first-person from the perspective of... someone? Some unportrayed member of the team no one else seems able to observe? Who contributes no labor toward the survival of the group? I guess this explains how the writer manages to find the time to scribble it all out and scrap-book in grim polaroids in discrete hourly doses.While there are some nice touches here (injury reports result in splashes of blood covering the page, and as night falls, it becomes more and more difficult to see the page), the text gets repetitive fast, especially considering how easy it is to lose the game repeatedly and fly through half a dozen false starts. Once you manage to survive for a while, you start encountering special unique events that spice things up, but it's a bit of a trek getting past the early difficulty curve.Zafehouse: Diaries is not without its charms, and it can be a solidly addictive time sink for a couple afternoons, but don't expect Z:D to make your list of favorites. When everything's added up, I'd be tempted to cautiously recommend it, but the Z in the title just cannot be overlooked or forgiven.			"

												I really want to like the game, but two (in-game) hours and people are already fighting. There is an end game apparently, but sh*t goes downhill at the start and just keeps gaining momentum. Even if you do things right and pick the right people for certain missions, the game just rolls the dice that says ""you're dead"" on every side of the dice. I spent money on a dying simulator that I don't even get to see. It's very easy to just say, ""this person died."" when you order them to go out. Spent a lot of time trying to beat this game, trying the best I can to keep the people alive as we get closer and closer to getting out alive, then all of a sudden. ""This dude died, this chick gets♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥about it and hates everyone. So she's unresponsive and won't work well with anyone, then she dies as well. Now it's harder to do anything with only three people. Now everyone is dead. Good luck next time, sucker.""Also, ""They did the best they could. Given they only had a jacket to defend themselves.""

												This game could be so good but suffers from the ""Luck"" factor. It's understandable to have chance in a game but when you're striving your hardest to play intelligently and skillfully when the majority of what happens is blind luck. Sure you can play in a fashion that would give you the best survivability BUT it's just a roulete whether one survivor with a golf club may kill multiple zombies and come back without a scratch or whether a complete group of well armed and geared up survivors gets killed in one turn by a group of 10 or even 5 zombies!! Really? There are so many random happenings even when your fortify a shelter and gear up and the stats don't even seem to help much. There's more but not much that other reviewers haven't already said. Could be such a great (not good but great) but just falls flat on it's face with frustration.			"

												Music, Sound, and Special Effects can all be disabled.  Windowed mode is default, but it can be stretched to widescreen.  It worked great for me in full-screen mode, but when Alt-tabbing out of the game, everything looks bigger than it's supposed to be.  Results may vary~ :D  When you make changes between full-screen and windowed, you'll have to exit the game and re-enter for the changes to take effect (or at least I did.)There are three different modes of play:  No Survivors (Easy), Road Kill (Normal), and Deadline (Hard).  Each difficulty is clearly explained when you start a new game.  What I didn't realize until writing this review is that there are also options for difficulty.

The graphics are a bit stark and simplistic, but that works with this game, in so many respects.  This is a world overridden with zombies, and those ""boring"" graphics just WORK with the theme.There is a lot of reading to do, but in small chunks that bring you deeply into the story without overwhelming you with walls of text (like my reviews?

I highly recommend checking out this series.  Just the first video will give you the basics of gameplay, but I kept watching because I found it fascinating seeing how different the guy's choices were as compared to the ones I'd have made.  If you watch the video(s) it will be obvious, but just in case, here are some basics:Each character is assigned a symbol, and you can move the characters to different places by picking up the symbol and dropping it somewhere else on the map, board game style!  When you send a character somewhere, you have three choices:  Investigate, Breach, and Assault.  Investigate is self-explanatory, but here's what the others do:  Breaching means breaking into the house.  If you've chosen Breach, they're in for the long-haul, and you can't cancel it even if they realize that there are dozens of zombies in the house.  ^_^;  Assault means that your character is going to go and kill any zombies outside of the location, and whatever they can kill through the windows, too, if they have ranged weapons to do so with.  Just choosing one of these options is not enough!!  TIP (because it's not immediately clear that you can do so when you're playing the game):  Be SURE to take some items with you!  If you're investigating, maybe take a flashlight and/or binoculars, if you're assaulting, weapons are a good idea.  When you're breaching, you might need something to help you break into the place!This is a permadeath game... kind of.  When you first start out, you'll make a lot of mistakes, and have to start over again quite a bit.  That's all part of the learning process!  At some point, though, you're going to get vested in your characters and want to save the game.  Well, you can save the game... after all, how much fun would it be if you could never turn off the game and do other things?  Thing is, if all of your characters die, that's it, you can't reload... BUT, as long as ONE character is left living at the end of the turn, you can reload as many times as you like. XDFantastic game for someone like me who enjoys environmental games with plenty of story and ZOMBIES! lol~ ;)			"

												This game is a work of art. It's just amazing! If you're into strategy in general, this game is for you.While you're never really IN the game itself (smashing zombie's to pieces) you control what goes on;Make 'Kin' watch for zombies, while 'Jine' makes ammo.There's skill levels; One star to five stars (though without making custom content, I've never seen anyone go over 4 stars)There's medicine; 'Jine' threw a chair at 'Kin' and broke his arm. (The wounds never fully heal while I play, but you can turn off survivors hurting each other)There's noise; While 'Jine' is making ammo, the noise attracts zombies.There's custom content; Want a superawesomemegazombiekillingmachine? I did. I made one. It uses pistol ammo, while being a sniper. My survivors also modified it so that it's a shotgun as well!! You can also make custom survivors (AMAZING!!!)There's rain; ...the rain should dampen the noise.There's random events; A woman with a shopping cart came by today. She says she'll trade ____ for ____You can make notes and signs on the map; Cross out a place you've looted and moved away from, circle and note down your base.You can ajust difficulty SPECIFICALLY; How many zombies per in-game hour flow into the city? How much ammo is scattered? How many zombies in the buildings to start with? How much food? How much medicine?There's hunger.Survivors rest after working for some time.THIS GAME IS JUST AMAZING!!!!!!!Oh, Pro Tip: CHESS SETS ARE DEMONNNNSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!			"

												The idea of the game is great. And it's fun at first, until you realise that it's way too repetitive and the extent to which you can customise is too limited to bring satisfaction. Ever since I bought the game, I hoped for new patches, or updates. I doubt anything of the like will ever happen. Which is a shame, because the game had promise.			"

												Sounds good on paper, plays out poorly. Pretty boring, and very random... People in my groups were in arguments, throwing stuff at each other within' two turns, without any obvious way to stop it. The real nail in the coffin is the repeated boring text. Prepare to read the same few lines over and over for how ever long you're willing to endure this. If you play the ""normal"" mode you may get a few hours of enjoyment finding clues and getting your survivors out the first time, but I have no idea who would be interested in playing a heavily stacked game of ""roll the dice"" with the zombies again. Cops can't hit the broad side of a barn with scoped weapons, and construction workers couldn't put down a zombie with modified melee weapons (bats, hammers, wrenches, even sledgehammers) if their lives depended on it... Literally. Unless you're sitting in a barricaded house, pulling your pud, you will always be a walking buffet.Hopefully they bother to continue patching it and turn it into something like what the steam page describes... Until then, considering the value of $10 during the Fall Sale and soon to come Christmas sale, this is literally nothing. Not worth anyone's time or money.			"

												A game that had potential, but ultimately falls WAY short because of lazy gameplay mechanics. Pros:+ Zombie survival planner, who doesn't want one of these?+ Decent audio/musicCons:- Survivor interaction: the biggest♥♥♥♥♥♥aspect of this game. Survivors have different traits, and most of these are just making your life hell, survivors turn into annoying, racist, violent crybabies. ""What, there's a zombie attack going on? "" ""Oh, too bad, I really hate that black dude, i'm gonna kill him first.""Interaction is basically all RNG, and it's frustrating trying to deal with a downward spiral of morons.- Development was stopped a month after release, and it shows- personal pet peeve: 3D black&white filter photos in an otherwise complete 2D hand-drawn game. Might just be me, but I think that's just lazy design.- Gameplay is repetitive, and has a lot of stupid areas that are underdeveloped.Ultimately, the only thing that's even remotely finished or noteworthy about this game is the UI. DOn't buy, not even in a sale.			"

												So this one was an unexpected, yet, pleasant surprise. I got it as part of the blink bundle, which before a week ago I'd never even heard of. When I saw screenshots of the gameplay, I was very skeptical of the rather simplistic diary view, and the whole concept of a game being based entirely on diary entries was a little odd to me. However, as soon as I started playing, I began to see just how fun and engaging it really is. Even without fancy graphics, this game manages to engross you in a zombie infested world, and you'll find yourself being easily absorbed into the addictive gameplay. The easy addition of custom content is just the icing on this deliciously zombie infested cake, and allows you to effortlessly add you and your friends into the game. You can even add your own location photos to take it one step further, allowing you to truly act out the apocalypse in your own home town.			"

												Please ignore the time played here, I played the game on an average of 10 hours back before it came onto Steam.Zafehouse: Diaries is a rather unique take on the survival/strategy genre. There are 3 different modes with different difficulties, that ultimately have the same goal, survival. Towns, events, items and survivors are all randomly generated. You can customise a survivor with your own story and backgrounds, which will then be randomly generated from a pool.You interact with a diary that displays all the events that are happening during each hour.  When I first played the game I was alittle put off by the fact that you interact with a diary. However as I played I fully understood why the interface is how it is and it is surprisingly informative. You can assign tasks for each survivor that they will try to acomplish to the best of their ability depending if they are any good at it (i.e. scavenging, barricading, cooking, etc.).The game has quite alot of depth to it and some deep mechanics. A good example is that it might be wise to get one of your survivors to scout that motel a few doors down to see if there's any zombies, so that your group have somewhere nice to rest. Or maybe that hospital crawling with walkers has that bandage you so desperately need.It also runs pretty well, even on them old toasters that are years old.I did a mini Let's Play series on it that covered some of the newer updates, you can find the playlist here "

Product received for free
												Zafehouse Diaries is a zombie survival horror genre type of game that tries hard to please the audience but fails due to certain limitations and unbalanced issues. The game is text based and makes usage of a diary used to read all the events happening every hour, a clock used to advance the time and a map with the locations in game. The game itself seems quite pleasing at the first glance especially if you are a fan of survival games such as State of Decay and This War on Mine but unlike those titles, the game fails to deliver due to the random events that seem to be counter-productive most of the time.The game has a couple of features that can be accessed from the very beginning, such as improving objects, scouting for zombies, making meals, barricading the building you are in, making traps as well as quite some other features. More of those features unlock depending on the location where you establish yourself. The game also has survivors which come different background, personalities, professions, prejudices and usually perks such as better cooks, better improving items, better at fighting zombies and so on. Through the game you also get random events such as getting extra survivors, people asking for food or raiders attacking your place. Those events are usually pretty limited and the game stalls after a while.The graphics of the game are pretty average overall however the sound does redeem a game a little. Unfortunately, the game tends to lack in quite some domains. For instance, the survivors you have never actually level which means that the game will always be hard and they will always be at risk of dying. Some might see it as a challenge but unfortunately the game has even more tedious issues which makes it downright frustrating sometimes. In a specific game I had a house fully equipped with traps and yet four zombies slipped by and killed my two survivors. This is but an example of the frustration you will be dealing with in the game. There is no balance so to speak and even with the best weapons and armors your survivors might die to just a couple of zombies. This scenario was tested on easy, therefore I cannot imagine what is required to survive on hard mode considering how unbalanced the game is right now.Another big issue is the lack of support in the game. The last patch has been done on 22 October 2013, therefore the game is left by the developers so do not expect any fixes nor any new features or DLC. Overall, I would not recommend the game due to all the limitations and issues.

												It's like a mix of turn-based strategy and text adventure to create a diary-like experience of the zombie apocalypse. Each playthrough feels unique, and with certain implementations such as character relationships and permadeath, it can be quite a stressful experience. The developer is pretty cool too, even if the updates had taken a while to come along in the past.			"

												I bought this while it was on sale for about $3, and IMHO, it's a gem of a game. The game feels immersive and keeps you constantly on your toes. At times, it even throws a curveball at you when you think you have things under control. Sure, it can be punishing in the beginning when you are unsure on what to do, but once you have become a ""seasoned survivor"" (i.e. you get used to the game), it really isn't all that difficult, and most of it, is common sense. For example, before trying to breach into a building with unknown zombie population, it would make more sense to investigate / assault it first, to make sure your whole party don't end up dead. No, having a full party with good weapons does not guarantee that your party would survive a breach when you are surrounded by an entire horde of zombies. Makes perfect sense. As for the complaints on relationship management, keep doing the right things and the relationship statuses would eventually improve. The rumour feature is just to help out if relationships become really bad. Also, as with real life, if two people don't get along, it's best not to get them to do same activity together, especially in stressful situations and when they are tired (and cranky).If you are like zombie themed games, as well as text-based games, this comes highly recommended. A solid 7/10. "

												It's a nice little zombie game. What makes it special is that it's almost completely textbased. This won't stop you from spending a great amount of time with it. The ""special effects"" bring some colour and action into the gameplay and you often find yourself bitting your nails, waiting for the results of your last turn.An additional Perk is that you can customize a great deal of things. Adding your own pictures or making your own weapons and tools for your survivors to find adds a personal note to your struggle for survival. If you play it on endless mode this struggle can become pretty boring though. You might end up wondering if you should just send your survivors into a zombie horde and be done with it. But for this little money it's a nice game for every now and then if you're bored with fancy animations and 3D Gameplay ;)			"

Zafehouse: Diaries is rare not just for the unusual creation that it is (a mostly-text, indie, turn-based strategy survival simulator set in the zombpocalypse) but also for the fact that it makes generous allowance for the player's imagination to engage and enhance the experience.  That imagination factor is a feat which the majority of videogames - in striving for linear, accessible stories and/or impressive visuals & audio - leave little or no room for. Screwfly Studio's work here is admirable considering it was a startup with only two guys.  Their next planned project, Deadnaut is a similar game set in space.  If they do carry over and improve upon the mechanics from Zafehouse, I am definitely picking it up.  For context, I got Zafehouse on Good Old Games a while back, but over time it's been patched into better shape.  My 11 or so hours played as of this writing reflect the time it took me to replay every game mode, grab the achievements for a perfect game and fiddle with the custom content a bit.  Zafehouse has three modes that scale in difficulty from easy to hard: Ongoing free survival mode Vehicle repair escape scenario Helicopter rescue escape scenario  The game randomly generates your survivors and the town map, then you direct them to essential tasks while progressing one hour at a time.  The story is as barebones as zombie apocalypse gets but there's decent replayability thanks to the gameplay, at least until such time as you've mastered the mechanics on the standard modes and played out custom scenarios to your satisfaction.  Gameplay is a finely tuned balancing act involving staying alive and safe, keeping survivors happy (or at least not at each others' throats) and finding/managing scarce resources while accomplishing objectives within the mission parameters.  The relationship system really does add flavor to the experience and I would love to see more along these lines in gaming.  Perhaps it's not so finely tuned as we would like, but as far as I know this game is one of a kind and the formula can only be improved upon over time.  I'm willing to overlook some design and balance issues as well as lack of depth & complexity in mechanics.  What visual and audio does exist is also limited - serviceable, but not awe inspiring.  There are no technical issues or bugs whatsoever and the game is very low resource, which is unsurprising given that it's a small game.  What you see in the screenshots on the Steam store page really is what you get.  One thing that I had tons of fun with was the custom content manager which I used to create a group of survivors based on my family & friends.  Dropped them into a town with locations based on my own favorite hangouts, and imported pics for all of it.  As I said initially, this is a game that encourages the imagination, and that is all the more true when you get to play out the apocalypse scenario with familiar people and places.    I recommend Zafehouse: Diaries if, as in my case, this game immediately caught your eye as something different in the genre and potentially fun.  Normally I make no comment about price or promotions, but I would probably pick this up while it's on sale.  The biggest red flag to be aware of however is that the game information is provided to you in diary form.  The journal provides 90% of the information you need to play the game.  I realize that's not for everyone, but for those who aren't revved up at the prospect of reading a wall of text, I will just say by the time you're familiar with the mechanics, you'll be skimming through it very quickly and painlessly.  In closing my reviews I usually provide a few tips but I'll keep that light here, since the fun of Zafehouse includes learning and mastering aforementioned mechanics.TIP: Items can be modified multiple times (e.g. Silenced handgun ---> Silenced scoped handgun).TIP: Items can be scrapped by left clicking them from the Supplies view, which is useful if you're trying to get a survivor to modify a specific item; just scrap the superfluous inventory.TIP: Traps do make noise, which attracts zombies to your location.TIP: Searching a new area once for ""anything useful"" should be enough to discover mission relevant info/items, if any exist at that location.TIP: Splitting up survivors instead of keeping them all together is a viable strategy and particularly useful in certain situations, but also comes with higher risk of injuries or deaths from zombie attacks.

												It is a decent game compared to the horde of other zombie games.I have not won a game yet but eventually I'm sure I will.Tips I can give.1. Save frequently. One thing I've also done is moved the Zafehouse Diaries folder in My Documents to Dropbox. Making a NTFS junction from the original location to the dropbox location means I can technically restore back to any point as long as I have been saving frequently.2. Events can be cruel, hence tip #1. I've found that sometimes an event is unwinnable but if I reload it enough, sometimes the event doesn't happen or can be mitigated.3. Your survivors will eat way too fast. Searching for more supplies quickly and efficently is a must.4. Assault a location before trying to breach it. Assaulting lets you kill more zombies than patrolling does.5. Having more than two safehouses is useless in my opinion. The time required to secure a location is long enough when done quickly and noisily. Going slowly and quietly can take forever. Hence, I tend to secure two locations on opposite sides of the town right away. If I find the zombies getting too thick nearby, I can move.6. Guns are useless. They just make alot of noise and draw the zombies.7. Move your survivors as a group. More people during the assault makes it safer, during the breach too. After a successful breach, you'll want one person patrolling (to thin the herd outside attracted by noise), one person watching (to ensure that the zombies breaking in don't surprise the group), and one person searching (for food, medicine and vehicle parts) at a minimum. If you're in a factory, have one person improving gear (defense, breach/assault, searching). There is always jobs that can be done.			"

												In a world of zombie apocalypse games that involve running around bashing zombies in the head with pointy objects or shooting them, Zafehouse: Diaries is a breath of fresh air. Well, not too fresh. Slightly festering and putrid, if I'm being honest. But, what do you expect from a zombie infested town?I look at Zafehouse: Diaries as a cross between an RTS, in that you have a town to explore, the top down view of the map, the careful exploration; and an RPG in the careful balance you need to accomplish between your team members, the collecting gear, finding food and medication, and praying you don't get too badly injured. Injuries are bad. They severely compromise that character's ability to do tasks, and require proper medical attention and supplies to treat.There are three modes of gameplay - Survival, escape by road, and escape by air. Each presents a very different type of game. Survival is the easy option. You start off solo, and have to survive for as long as possible, building your team as you go. My longest time is in the weeks. My shortest, in the minutes.Escape by road is the 'middle difficulty'. You have a team of 5 characters, each with their own priorities, prejudices, likes and dislikes, and have to balance their happiness and health long enough for you to explore the town, find the car, and collect all the parts you need to get it working again. This is the type of game I have completed the most, and I can tell you that there are multiple endings, depending on how you do.The final game type is the hardest. You have one week to assemble all of the clues and find a radio, and that will allow you to contact a helicopter for rescue. Take too long though, and you miss your opportunity. Move too quickly, and you risk your people being picked off one by one as they split up to search houses, shops, warehouses, factories, churches, schools, and so on.The last thing I would like to mention is the Mods menu. Built into the game itself is the ability to create new characters to use, and new buildings for the town. Doing so, however, will disable achievements as this can be used to severely unbalance the game.On the whole, if you are enjoy a good zombie apocalypse, but are looking for something a little different, then this could be the game for you.This review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

												This was a disappointment for me, it could not hold my attention for any length of time, and I have given this game plenty of tries. It is lazy storywriting, lazy gameplay, and just overall rather boring after 30 or so minutes. You will die, you will not get to pass go, you will not collect $200.Pros:Sound effects are fairly high qualityCons:Gameplay - Its repetative, listless, boring, you legitimately spend the first two days 'fortifying' if you don't get RNG ran over by a hoard. The next series of days you're trying to attract other survivors (in the Endless gameplay), and being overran within the first 3 days in the ""story"" mode.Character interactionIts ridiculous. Any attempts at improving the quality with others, will degrade to the point where people will start killing eachother. The developers were INSANELY lazy with this one, you have no chance to determine how your characters interact, its all RNG if they will get along or not, and more often than not, they won't, and even if they do, they'll eventually get mad at eachother.Survival aspectThis one was a halfway Con/Pro for me. It offers a decent survival aspect, but it was not fleshed out by any means whatsoever. What you see is what you get, and that isn't much. You are prevented from getting any substantial supplies throughout the ""campaign"", because any attempts at breaking into a building will result in a hoard, and more often than not you'll get swarmed from the inside and end up losing either the entire team, or at least one. Its very unforgiving, which is fine, if it wasn't ridiculous in making sure you are guaranteed to fail 99% of the time.Overall:Avoid. All who enter may despair. Save your money, save your time. I also would go further and recommend avoiding the developers Screwfly Studios, because they sure as hell want to screw you over. They will take your money and run, they will ignore a product and just push on to making the next ""promising"" title and then do nothing with it.			"

												No strategy involved, it's a game of chance.  You can barricade up a house, modify all your weapons and armor, breach a building that only 1 zombies been spotted in and end up fighting a horde of 20 that slaughter everyone.  You can't retreat, you can't make any decisions in combat, you just read what happened that turn.  On the other hand, sometimes a single survivor with a bat will kill 9 zombies on patrol.All you really do in this game is look at the map, give up to 5 people orders such as being a lookout or search the building.  You can also secure a building, this is about as in depth as the strategy goes.  Once your done with the building, travel to another location on the map and hope your people don't get massacred when they arrive.  Also, an annoyance, each survivor can only carry a few pounds...  So 5 survivors might only get to carry 16 lbs of items.  Traveling back and forth to move items from a secured house to your new secured location is very tedious and without much reward.The game has not been updated for a couple years, the forums seem empty, and the game is buggy.  The programming in it seems very old, it doesn't autosave and saving/loading is not intuitive.  In fact the GUI is quite lacking but since it's not very complex it's pretty easy to figure out.			"

												This is an interesting game that had potential. Many different scenarios and choices to make. You can fortify your stronghold and improve weapons and character relationships. Move from house to house gathering supplies and killing zombies, or search and patrol your safehouse. Purpose and difficulty need to be addressed however, as there seems to be a lack of a main goal or objectives; and you can have a strong group with many weapons and protective gear, and yet be slaughtered with 1 wrong choice. Your characters are all at each others throats from the second you click ""Start Game"", and it is a very slow and arduous task of improving relations, that never gets finished as they will die off before you make everyone happy. Combat is very dissapointing also, as you can have armour and strong weapons, yet when zombies attack, or you go out on the offensive, be prepared to see that your characters suffered injuries or died because they only used a butter knife and a jacket, when they had in their possession: Guns, machetes, helmets and bats. Leaves you feeling bitter and frustrated.Just read the other negative comments, every single one seems to sum up the game exactly how it is.Not the worst game for the cheap price, a time killer, if you think a few pounds/dollars is worth 1-2 hours of playing.

												As the (terrible) name suggests, this is a game about stories. It's about the moments where you send a survivor on a suicide mission to retrieve some snacks for her starving comrades, or finding that one precious item in an innocuous house, or sending someone to aid a survivor besieged by a zombie horde. It resembles the browser/mobile classic Rebuild, but offers plenty more options in actions and equipment.It's punishingly hard, and made rather more frustrating by being somewhat arbitrary, or at least obscure. Having well-equipped and skilled survivors wiped out by a motley group of zombies is bad enough, but having the survivors seriously injuring each other over a dispute over who gets to use the shower first is just annoying. Still, the great moments are well worth the frustrations.			"

They're easy to use and being able to add anyone and anything to the game really opens up your options. *Pro-tip* Soap is very important to happiness, always have soap.			"

tl;dr -> Survivor 1 was racist against Asians, I had 3 in my squad of 5, so I sent him out to die while scouting a bank. Everyone else was happy, but eventually starved to death after a few weeks because I was intent on upgrading/modifying all the items in my warehouse instead of scouting. 11/10 realistic simulator.I got this game in a bundle and was very excited to try it because I've played countless zombie games on gaming websites like Kongregate and Newgrounds. I was very satisfied with my experience.If you like text-based games, the zombie post-apocalypse theme, and crafting/strategy-based gameplay, then you will enjoy this game.The aesthetics are good, there are pictures of items you find and the delivery of the gameplay is very nice - given in the form of a journal with text/picture entries. The game is solely text-based, so do not play this if you do not like reading (or this genre). There are 3 game modes, one of which is endless (easy). The randomized character backgrounds and random events are well-done, however, one complaint I have is the very (seemingly) arbitrary way the character relationships is determined. More on this later.The controls are simple and there is a brief tutorial to show you how to play. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with survival strategy games. The most challenging aspect of the game is balancing your actions (scout, search, fortify, etc) properly to maximize your chances for survival. You can modify a few elements like how often resource-generating buildings appear and  whether or not characters can get injured from in-group fighting.The gameplay consists of performing specific actions every hour (equivalent of one turn). Actions include fortifying the building you are in, searching for items, building traps, etc. You can further specify the actions by clicking on keywords that are highlighted in green - for example, you can specify an order to build ""traps,"" ""experimental traps"" (indoor), or outdoor traps. Certain actions generate noise that will draw in progressively larger groups of zombies. You can counteract this by sending survivors out to patrol, or by sniping surrounding zombies (trade-off is your use of ammo and potentially drawing in more zombies). If the building you are in gets completely surrounded, your characters will be severely restricted in the actions they can do. During the night, visibility is lowered and overall danger is increased.You can either start with 1 survivor (easy mode) or 5, however, you can only gain new members in easy mode (which is also endless mode). The survivors will have randomized stats - these are given no numerical value. Stats include social economic status (poor, middle-class, rich), job, overall personality traits, and proficiency in actions (better at cooking, scouting, etc). All characters will also have a negative attribute, such as racism or distrust of the opposite sex. You can try to mitigate this by spreading rumors - one each day, and only one of each type. Rumors can be things like a cousin relationship between two characters or a charitable act for certain people. Rumors act as a double-edged sword - it will usually increase the relationship between the associated characters, however, it can also polarize survivors that do not like the associated characters (causing them to like each other even less). The relationship mechanic is crucial to survival because characters in conflict will argue and fight - dropping the overall morale of the group and potentially injuring people. Actions are also completed significantly slower when characters in conflict are near each other, so a good idea is to send polarized characters to different areas (or even sacrificing problem survivors). You can increase relationships by having feasts, but this requires a lot of food and will draw in zombies.There is a randomized map with different structures in the city to explore. Special buildings yield bonuses like increased security (banks) and better loot/modifying (warehouses). Once you fully secure a building, you can further fortify it - eventually adding things like watchtowers, fences, and sniper posts. Fortifying takes a significant amount of time and will most likely attract larger groups of zombies. A downside of securing/fortifying a building is going back inside it - you will always need a survivor inside to let others in. If you leave a secured/fortified building with no one inside, you will have to break back in, however, there will never be zombies within. A good idea is to at least secure a few safehouses before proceeding to fortify. There are different approaches you can take when playing this game, adding a decent amount of replayability. Overall, if you enjoy this genre, then you should really give Zafehouse a try.Definitely recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I found this game to be a real treat. It is addicting and well worth the ten dollars. The game somewhat reminded me of rebuild, but with more depth. I often find myself coming back to it. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging and interesting strategy game.			"

												Surprisingly good zombie survival game. Has a really similar art style to This War of Mine without the sidescrolling elements. Unbelievably difficult (I've never beaten it). Really wish this had a mac port or I'd play it more.			"

												An interesting, in depth, and addicting game. This game looks at an interesting balance between control and simulation. You can give tasks to your survivors according to their ability and relationships, but there is little control over how they perform, or even what supplies they use. To an extent, this removal of control acts against the game, but it gives the game a layer of complexity, depth, and free form that isn't present in most simulations. It's difficult to see this game as anything other than a simulation, and anybody longing for more control over their characters (such as in XCOM) will find this game lacking.What I've said is bad about the game, mostly. Describing the game's qualities is difficult to interpret in words. It possesses a dynamic feel, where everything connects to everything else, and challenges players to focus on the intricacies that aren't specified. The game is unforgiving and extremely challenging, which I feel accurately represents a zombie survival situation more effectively than most other games. Some ideas for updates would make this game really awesome. One idea is to present the player with a floor plan of each building, showing which rooms have been searched, as well as the locations of doors and windows. This will allow players to think much more strategically. Another idea is to provide some form of gameplay, maybe even minigames, which would allow players to have more control over the outcomes of certain events, such as assault, barricade construction, or defense. While the simulation feel of characters doing these tasks on their own is fine, without some form of control in these areas the majority of the gameplay revolves around text.Overall, a very good game, and I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a realistic simulation of a zombie survival.

												it's like a point and click adventure mixed with Sims set in a zombie apocalypse. Impossibly hard to win but still surprisingly fun after hours and hours of playing - if anything you can take your favorite characters and set them into a zombie apocalypse and see how the minor indefferences are settled by throwing computers at each other. good times.

												I would recommend the game, it is a very strategic game where you need to manage tasks and relation ships. If a relationship deteriorates too far there may be fights between the 2+ which can lead to bruises or even death, it may also dampen everyones mood in trying to survive. Going guns ablazing into a house you never scouted is a bad idea, do this and you may lose some people, work in groups, keep everyone happy with eachother, find a easily defenseable area, have your people create items to bring a advantage for them and a disadvantage to your foes. This game has alot of mirco-management such as should i bring the shotgun, soap, or a deck of playing cards, each would bring a diffrent benefit that can change the fate of your survivors. If you wanted to, you could actully import your on pictures and names to bring some actull feel for your survivors.			"

												It took me awhile to warm up to this one.  The interface is so obtuse and important information isn't always apparent.  I played about twenty minutes of it and shelved it for a couple months.  It didn't feel like anything was happening in the game.Then a week ago, I decided to give it another try.  I imported some photos of friends and family and made some custom survivors.  Once I came to understand the interface and learned to sift through the information--I discovered a fairly fun little zombie survival game.  It's not perfect, and has some quirks, but I've seen a number of nice, tragic little stories unfold on my laptop since I put a few hours into the game.Recommend at five bucks.  Don't pay a cent over 9.99.			"

												I wanted to like the game because of its premise but every time I play it I quit from frustration over the myriad of horrible developer decisions that make this game virtually unplayable. First of the game is punishing difficult but that difficulty comes from the horrible inventory system, lack of displayed information and survivor social interactions. Secondly the game is technical mess for example quitting out of the game causes the game to still be active requiring you to restart Steam to play the game. Finally, the game looks like crap. It looks like a board game that was made into a game. Overall, the game is crap. Save your money for much better survivor games like This War of Mine, State of Decay or Don't Starve.			"

												Unfun and unfair. A game where a healthy group of people with guns get taken down by one zombie is just not enjoyable.

												Um, this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ It has a lot of really good ideas, which it then completely asses up in execution. You don't directly control your survivors, which lets the game give them 'personalities' - or rather one single personality that they all share: a volatile combination of batshit-crazy and face-palm stupid. At first I thought there were complex sim elements behind the scenes, but as it turns out, it's just a straight-up random number generator.

												As others had said about the game, the developers haven't given this game enough attention. It's all too small and simple, even though it is a TEXT-BASED GAME. You would expect lots of complexity and story and detail set into the game, but no, it doesn't have that. Anything they attempted to be complex, is just a problem throwing a lot of info into your face, but then it has a simple solution. Anyway, time for the normal: Pros and Cons.Pro's:-Rather addictive-Hard and challenging, along with time consuming-Able to customize with in-game workshop-Pictures and random events are niceCons:-Zombies are freaking weird, I killed 12 and got killed by 4 within 2 hours in-game-Way too simple for text game, you see pretty much the entire game within about 2 hours-It freaking crashes at random times-Extremely difficult without creating overpowered♥♥♥♥♥♥in workshop-Relationship system is retared-You see pretty much the entire game within about 2 hoursI don't recommend this game solely for that fact that it is $10, it is not worth it at all. I would be a lot more understandable at maybe $2, but at $10, I feel cheated out of my money for a game that had the potential for a hell of a lot more. Just play Rebuild and you'll have a better time.			"

												This game is brilliant. There is no other way to put it. It's all text and picture based, so dont expect any epic cutscenes or running around, but this in no way detracts from the experience. There are 3 exciting scenarios to choose from, my favourate being the standard survival mode. You can also create your own characters, give them pictures and give them custom jobs with custom skill sets. The only downside to that is you dont get any achievements while using them, but that's fair enough. I have found myself having ""just one more game"" hundreds of times. Its addictive, rewarding and satisfying. Even when you die, you'll find yourself planning how to avoid that situation next time. Brilliant game, I would reccomend to anyone who likes text based games.			"

LIke, most of the pos/neg occurances are entirely randomized, and you can only use each TYPE of rumor once. Once they've been used, you're dead in the water. The thing I do like about this game is the custom survivor, item, and place thing.

												I was on the fence about this as I haven't tended to like text-based games in the past but purchased this on a whim and am so happy I did. I took a bit of time to create a few customized places, survivors, and professions before starting the sandbox mode, and if you have any interest in that I'd highly recommend it. It was extremely easy and, at least for me, added immensely to the game. It did take me a few tries to get the hang of surviving (on my first start I ended up with a giant horde of zombies around me within the first 24 hours, second start I wandered into a hospital trying to get medicine and learned the importance of scouting), but I had infinite patience once I saw how frequently the survivors I'd created appeared. It added quite a bit more motivation to keep things running smoothly! Imagine my surprise and delight in one game when the starting character (who happened to be the one based off me) came upon the next survivor who turned out to be the character I'd made for my favorite celebrity! We were quickly surrounded by a giant horde of zombies with no weapons, no barriers, and very little food, but I got such a kick out of finding us together that I had to find a way to make it work. One gripe would be it takes so long to build the barriers (certainly longer than would be realistic, although to be fair they do give you many more supplies inside to build barriers than is realistic) and sometimes even when you're being slow & quiet the lookout will say you're making so much noise you're a beacon for zombies. Haven't quite figured that out yet. Traps haven't seemed to really have a benefit yet either.But I think that's it. I intended to play for only a little but I found that, even though it paused every turn, I found that I couldn't step away. I completely missed dinner and stayed up way too late, definitely worth every penny.			"

 For those who are willing to lose... a lot. So...where to begin? For every game, it will have its pros and cons. For every player, it's up to them to decide what a game's pros and cons are. This review was made to (hopefully) make you decide whether you should buy this game or not. So without anymore delays, long and interesting sentences, long agonizing vocabulary words, and delays...  Let's start with the pros of the game!Overall, this game is astounding, repetive, and challenging. This game is based on strategy and randomly generated scenarios (mostly RNG).  Every desision you make can and will affect the situation your survivors have in any way possible. Whether choosing to inject yourself with a zombie ""cure"" (if you find it) or not, to let a little girl inside your safe house or not, or to kill one of your infected surviors or let them live in hopes of finding that cure (RNG could just straight out kill them if it wanted to). One of the best things about this game are the customization options. This game allows you to create your own survivors. Not only that, you can also customize and create your own occupations, locations, even gear! In my opinion, the best thing about this game is the idea of reading your survivors' story/diary. Whether they became trapped and met their awesome demise, or became one of the lucky ones who made it out of that dreaded city alive to tell the story. Now, I believe this game has the capabilities of being a best seller, however like every game, when there are pros, there are also cons.First of all, you must be accustomed to the fact that you will lose... a lot. It is a tendency to lose in almost every game you will play. No matter how ""good"" your group is well armed or skilled, you WILL lose. I, myself, have played this game hundreds of times... HUNDREDS! And out of those dreadful hours of losing and preparation, I only beat it fairly... ONCE. And by fairly, I meant getting the achievements I earned so far in this game by using the characters the game gave me, and abusing the save system like a ♥♥♥♥♥. Even if I would use my generated characters and their OP skills, my group would somehow end up being mauled by zombies, shot to death by crazed survivor groups, or being infected and dying from the virus. Survivor relations are also an issue because of the constant stress, arguements, and paranoia that will diminish one of your group member's relations with the rest of your group into hating each other instead of the zombies.Every so often, I check the statistics of this game (which I will put the link below) to see what the average win/ losses are worldwide. Some days I read that +40% of people killed an old lady that offered to trade supplies with them. Other days, +30% players had their group ditch one of their members in a room full of zombies to save the rest. These statistics show the amount of frustation, determination, and willingness to survive and complete their objective, even if it means to screw other people if it risks killing the rest of the group. Personally, I would have quit my current game or reverted to a previous save if a survivor died because it would just seem wise to do so (also because I'm a perfectionist)Overall, this game has pros and cons in terms of game play and survival. If I would rate this game, I would rate it an 7/10 because of the interesting factors and potenial. However, success in each game is heavily weighed on RNG.

												I had been looking EVERYWHERE for a non-combat based zombie game. I mean I love shooting a zombie in the face as much as the next person, but what I always wanted as a game based around the story and the survival and the relations between people. Much like Walking Dead the game. This is perfect if you enjoy text-based stories, building a place for your survivors to stay safe in, or finding a way out of town while collecting items, fighing zombies and occasionally fending off other survivors who come knocking on your door demanding someone.

												What I said when I first bought the game:I quite like this game, and unlike all the others of the genre, it doesn't make me queasy from the FPP!Well worth the low price.Now many hours later, it's driving me crazy. I haven't once come close to beating the game. Looking in the forum or on YouTube, no-one else has either. Despite the occasional updates, there are still, for me, serious balance issues in this game. For example, in some location even if you breach at full force and heavily armed, and you clear all the zombies in the location at the start, more zombies keep streaming in and you won't even get a chance to search the location or put up barricades. There are also other issues like some characters won't eat even when hungry and food is available.Having said there are problems with this game, I still find myself obsessively playing it. On that basis I would still have to recommend the game because I enjoy it despite its flaws. If they ever get the gameplay balance right this could become a classic.			"

												More of a text based simulation and hard as hell.but rewarding when you actually win. Having recently re-visited The world Of ZD i have decided to amend my review a bit and say that the game does have it's fun moments and Its flaw's. The best moments is the feeling of relief when you breach and clear a very valuable structure(hospital, police station etc.) That contains much needed supplies.The down side is when a completely random event kills your entire group in one go.If you can get past the difficulty and un-fairness of the game you will be left with a new perspective of the zombie apocalypse and what your odds are of actually surviving(btw they are slim to none).

												As you'd expect from the Z in the title, Zafehouse Diaries is a game about zombies. The game is similar to a rogue-like in its random nature; the town is randomized, your survivors are randomized, loot is randomized, etc. so that no two playthroughs are exactly the same. Or so it should be. You'll find yourself in the usual boring, dreary town with a bunch of useless, racist, janitor survivors that will break each others arms and legs for refusing to play a game of chess (Not kidding). Even worse, you can even end up with Survivors that aren't good at anything at all, and you're stuck with them. If a Survivor dies, they are dead, and you wont be getting another. Expect to be given the short end of the straw many times, and to see the same stock photos for your survivors over and over. The game is too randomized. Everything you do feels like a roll of the dice in the zombies favor. Trying to fight a number of zombies above ten, even with all your survivors armed to the teeth, is certain suicide. Chances are slim you'll be able to clear the hospital or police station, with the horde's numbers varying from 10 to 20, and even higher. Even then, trying to clear out locations is a hassle. First, you must send out a scout to check out how many zombies are outside and how many zombies are inside. You'll have to go by what they say, because even though they may have seen eight zombies inside, there are actually twenty-three. Now that you have the place scouted out, you'll need to Assault it. This consists of your survivors trekking over to the location through the city, and the murdering every zombie outside and shooting through the windows inside. More than likely, you wont get all the zombies inside. Finally, you'll need to Breach. Your survivors will go back to the location for the third time and make their way inside, where they will proceed to most definitely die - Or kill the zombies if you are immensely lucky.Overall, the game just feels unfinished and unfair. There isn't much to do besides explore buildings, clear out buildings, try to escape, and survive. Weapon variety is dismal, with most melee weapons being absolute garbage and ranged weapons being entirely too risky to use, lest more than ten zombies surround your 'base' and you have no way to get out. Zafehouse Diaries is a good idea, but it  still feels like an alpha game and not a complete product.The only thing I really, really enjoy about the game is the journal, although it's severely flawed as you will see the same messages over and over again. When it rains, the journal pages get wet and the sound of rain on the roof fills your ears. When it thunders, light flashes on the screen as it storms outside. When you fight, blood splatters the pages.Good ideas but with poor implementation. I strongly advise you to buy this at a largely reduced price, at least 4.99.			"

												It had lots of potential but, since the devs included super mutant zombies that can destroy even vault doors easly the game went sink.90% of the time zombies will smell you and start entering your safehouse even if you are quiet, they gonna rush and keep you supressed, barricading and getting it's detroyed at the same time while your food and medicine goes down, as your crew.Also, it's already finished, which is not good since most of the players really enjoy long-term updatings.For the price, might be good, your call.5/10  ( could be 8/10 easy if it weren't for some minor stuffs )			"

												TL;DR: The concept of the game is nothing new(many flash games who do better, aka last stand etc) but also the gameplay is just broken that even with high end gear you can have problems with 1-2 zombies and die.The game concept feels really good but actually this has been made several times and more complex than this. Free flash games like the last stand combine the hunting for items and fighting zombies aswell, way much more better. The controles are clunky and way too complicated. There is also too much micromanagement that is no way fun at all.The gameplay sucks and is only based on randomness. Even when someone is equipped with high end gear you can still have problems with 1-2 zombies. Also a person could take even 24 hours to just pull (1!!!) zombie corpse from the living room away. You cant equip items a person directly , what is really annoying. Zafehouse tries to get the player by having unique gameplay features like spying/looking into windows to see how many zombies are inside a building or being able to have your survivors guard your house or give them work like dragging zombie corpses away from your house. But still, the gameplay is just unbalanced and is too short to give even more fun than 1-2 hours of gameplay. After that you have already seen pretty much everything, except the random encounters of course, that just feel that the dev. just wanted some decision making inside the game.Wouldnt recommend it in any way, but had potential if the game had either be more focused on balance,>(and more content aswell) or having an actual gameplay, not just managing randomness where you have just slightly controles about the happening.3/10			"

												For me this game is a proof that it's still possible to create a fresh and fun to play zombie game in these days. Developer is 2 guys with good ideas who made them come to life using simple and climatic interface with minimal audio-visual feedback which reminds of digital board game editions appearing recently. I saw a lot of people complaining about difficulty and unfinished mechanics. Like any other game this one stops being crazy hard after You learn how to play it. About unfinished mechanics - argument is valid but It's not something that breaks the game or make it unplayable at any point. I get it that small developer like Screwfly has to manage it's time and resources carefully, they went with creating new game instead of supporting this one - no problem for me as in my opinion this didn't impact the amount of fun I got from Zafehouse Diaries.

												This game is an intense strategy game, I reccomend reading the manual(its free) that this game has created for players. This game has excelent custom content options.(the custom content is a ""you make it yourself"" kind of thing, but its quite simple) It allows you to control the intensity of surviving the apocolypse in option settings. There are multiple survival modes. Each type of building within the town you survive in is unique with usualy realy good, realy bad, and sometimes creepy Benefits/Consecuenses.Issues: For me the game has crashed consistantly about every 20 minets, and if you dont manualy save pariodicaly it'll lose all data for that game. The survivors in the game almost never get along well, if people were in a post-apocolyptic situation i think they would put their differences aside more than this game displays.			"

												First hour playing of this was like ""what am I doing?"". Developers provide complete and long guide of how to play the game; while going through it, I felt some satiation, like ""how much more rules should I learn to play this?"".After I finished the guide and another 30 minutes passed... well, that's when involvement began.A few weekend days spent in this game. For me it's not the common thing. Even now I can't imagine my morning without 30 minutes in Zafehouse.It's the game that makes you feel like you're reading great book and writing it at the same time. It plays with your imagination, it makes you feel things. And it almost certainly sets you up to fail... and you learn a mistake and give it another shot, with new survivors, new city, new relationship grid, but the same aim: survive another day.Sounds easy, huh? Well, you try to make it in Zafehouse: Diaries, when your destiny hates you, plays jokes with you, and your survivors ain't no Rick Grymeses, but ordinary people with their own prejudices, fears, feelings, weaknesses and exhaustions.This game is hard, sometimes annoying, but it certainly makes you a smarter person.

												An incredibly addictive, oddly deep game, Zafehouse certainly isn't for everyone however if you have the slightest feeling that it may be up your alley I'd say give it a go. There's enough randomised elements to give players quite alot of replay value if the game is up their alley, with the snapy pace of it also meaning it is rather easy to pop in and out of playing the game, trying to craft a new story each time.Zafehouse is most certainly flawed, although it is a sign of a... good game I guess where the flaws can on occasion help the game. For example I would say that the relationships shift far too quickly from positive to negative between people in the game however it sure as hell does help the tension as irritating as it may be.

												What can I describe about Zafehouse: Diaries?Its a zombie survivial horror game that isnt typically 1st person, you take on the role of different survivors (including yourself but the character creation isnt working) and in a diary themed turn based game you have to keep them alive at all costs.Its interesting and fun but gets a bit tiring after a while.Pros:Sound: Amazing sound- feels like you are really there whether barracading a door or fighting off zombies.Diary Style: Its interesting keeps the anticipating going- never knowing if your survivior survived.Different types of gameplay: Character creation and different types of hardmode, etc.Cons:Feels very short.Character Creation is not working at all!Bit repetative with the same maps, etc.A interesting concept but it depends on what you like.

												I myself love this game.Many people complain about smaller things in it, but when it comes down to it, this game is great. With the new Steam refund feature you have nothing to worry about either. Spend a hour and a half playing, see if you like it. If you dont, return it, if you do keep it!Its that simple. I feel it is worth the asking price, but some others may say wait for a sale. That is your decision :)EventsThe randomly generated events, and the ability to create your own survivors adds a sense of actual connection to the story. You will feel pressured by the logical side of a decision, and the emotional side. Every event has multiple outcomes, good and bad. But each event will also rely on what you have, and how are you prepared.RelationshipsEach character will not like somebody else for one reason or another in the start of the game. This means over time they will start to fight with eachother, and possibly hurt one another. If you dont get it under control, this can mean everybody will start to get upset. But you can fix this with rumors! But be careful, each rumor has sideeffects if your not careful! I have had a group of people perfectly happy with one another, but after one misplaced rumor hated eachother. So be careful! Events, or certain actions may anger one another too.ReplayabilityThis game is randomized to your will. It can be completely random, or you can add in people/items/locations/jobs if you would like. This means every game will be diffrent, no two maps are the same! It is a game of pure chance to a extent. But you can win it everytime if you are smart about how you play. "

												If I'm honest, although this game has a lot of potential and I'd still recommend it to those willing to put the necessary time into it, I found Zafehouse: Diaries to be a bit more needlessly complicated than it had to be. Some people like that sort of thing, I'm not among them. A lot of actions I felt could have been simplified, and it took me a good couple hours studying all the mechanics of the game to work out everything I needed to do in order to actually play. I had trouble figuring out how to do anything with equipment but scrap it for the first few rounds playing! Once I was in, the concept reminded me a lot of Rebuild 2 on Newgrounds, which, although there's less detail and customization involved, is easy to get right into. Okay, so I've complained enough, let's talk about some high points in this game. The fact that you can create a completely custom character with uploaded photos and customized stats puts a smile on my face. It's not every day you can make a group of zombie apocalypse survivors that includes yourself, the Egyptian god Set and Captain Picard. Another thing that caught my fancy was the fact that the characters had their own prejudices and insecurities, causing them to quarrel amongst themselves, a concept I feel isn't touched on enough in similar games. Just like in real times of crisis, the greatest danger can be the person sitting right next to you.So, in conclusion, this game definitely needs a bit of work to simplify things a little. I really hope it gets that work as time goes on, because it'd be a shame if a game with this much potential ends up overlooked by many because they were frustrated before they even got into the game itself.

												Too RNG, and no real control over what happens.  In one game, within the first couple of turns a fight broke out between survivors and the only one in my crew with fighting abilities somehow lost to the musician and came out of it with a broken leg, making him pretty much useless at what he was supposed to do.  In another, a fully loaded police officer, with upgraded pistol, rifle, and armor, died to two zombies.  This isn't ""hard,"" this is a game that does an RNG check to screw you over.  The choices all feel superficial, and while I have not played a ton, it really seems like the best strategy is to split all your survivors into separate houses and just not deal with the drama.			"

The premise is on itself without a flaw and the description of a game is rather eye catching: Help a group of random survivors endure the zombie appocalypse, make them work together and solve various quests. Where it falls appart is when teaching the people how to play exactly. More than once i have lost squads of survivors raiding a house that seemed like a certain win. Now, i know that the game is meant to have one keep suspence and such, but the fight results just feel so against you that it feels like there's nothing you can do to win. I don't want to hear that 'that's how the game is meant to be' because i just don't see a reason to it. The game's presentation is more than lacking and the gameplay slowly becomes redundant.			"

												A different way of portraying a zombie apocalypse. In this game you control 1-5 survivors, by giving them different tasks, in order to survive.The course of the adventure is displayed in the pages of a diary. Every looted item, every killed zombie, every breached building, all the things happening emerge in the form of letters. I thought this must be boring as hell, but its not.Theres certain amount of excitement when you anticipate next moves of your survivors, who are most certaintly annoyed of one another, and they will fight each other. You can release the tensions in your group by spreading rumours of certain persons charity work or affiliation in crime or you can have bottle of spirits, maybe even a chess board or guitar in inventory.The gameplay area is randomly generated, with several different buildings. There are also rare random events, with positive and/or negative side effects. There are 3 different game modes, easy being the ""easiest"", where you start with only one survivor, so you could die in the first building you venture into, if not properly geared up. But you have infinite number of other survivors finding their way to you, and your only objective is to survive, with no timelimit. Some buildings also generate resources.In normal mode you start with 5 survivors, and your task is to find a vehicle, and then find several parts to repair it. There is no time limit, but there are more and more zombies spawning in the town when time passes. You cant replace survivors.Hard mode also starts with 5 survivors, who cannot be replaced, and must find an evacuation point. Time limit is set to 1 week.As a fan of zombie games, this 1 is a fresh breeze and welcomed addition, in the evergrowing line of zombie games. But... its very difficult to handle, has several balance issues and the survivors are not from the sharpest end of the pencil.			"

												At $1.24, how can you go wrong.  Here's how - Day 2 :There don't appear to be any zombies within.  Jeremiah was gored, trampled and killed by 6 zombies.  He shot and killed 7 before they killed him.  Mitchell was gored, trampled and killed by 3 zombies.  He shot and killed 2 zombies before they killed him.  That was breaching an ""empty"" building after investigating it and arming the only two who got along from the initial 5.Either zombies kill your group, or their hatred kills them.  In the end, everyone dies, nobody cares.8/10 for idea.  1/10 for execution.  You have fully equiped characters with plenty of weapons and armor and they still die...why?  Because they hate each other.  Ultimately this game is ruined by every character hating every other character.  Even if you make them all friends, it's only temporary and the next time someone wants to play chess, they hate each other all over again and without cooperation, the groups all die.I tried this in beta and it was ok, now having purchased it I see how they ruined the whole idea and abandoned the game in favor of creating a sequel.  Is a sequel necessary for a game this bad?  No, don't think so.  The devs would have been better of making this more enjoyable.  Instead you have a game where there's a couple die hard fans voting it up while everyone else votes it down.  Instead of honest reviews, you see there is no latest reviews option since the latest ones all vote it down.			"

												I bought this game before it came available on steam and it is quite fun. Trying to manage the people however, I find is very difficulty and quite often they ended up at people's throats, but that could be just me failing at this game and I'm tempted to re-visit it.The idea is you and a group of other survivors try to survive and find out where the helecopter will be landing in town to rescue survivors. It's certainly not a easy game as you have to watch out for food, barricading off buildings your survivors are living in, managing your ammo, making life-or-death decisions that can either end up with losing no-one, one or two or even the entire group as what happened with me in one playthrough.As you can imagine there is a time limit in days as to what the helecopter is arriving so you need to get all the clues, get to that location, clear out any undead there, board up the place and make sure you have enough food to survive, but one realistic mechanic, which I personally found irritating, was how peoplee have prejudices and hate to other people. Some will have things like ""Mr. X claims he isn't racist, but he doesn't like the look of Mr. Y and Miss. F"" and others have hatred against rich, poor, middle-class, educated, uneducated and so on. A few times my group fell apart because even if you have the groups doing seporate things, sometimes there will be events where someone two people are laughing, the guy who dislikes them thinks it's about him, they get into a argument and nothing is done on either side.However there are ways to try and stop this. You can spread Rumours to improve someone's relations by comparing to other people's backstories. For instance, if you have someone who has difficulty getting along with two people because the hatred comes from them you can say ""Mr. X worked in a ___"" and you put Charity as one of them used to do charity work and then for the next part the other likes the poor, so you choose poor and the sentance turns into something like ""Mr. X worked in a Soup Kitchen where he fed the poor."" at people's attitues will start to change, however you will get conflicting personalities that might land him in the neutral zone with two people, but have another one hate him so you need to do a lot of balancing.Not a  easy game by any strech of the imagination, but certainly rewarding if you can get to the end. I havn't yet, but who knows.note: I bought this game off the company when I came across it on Greenlight which is why I appear to have 0 hours played on it on here. Same can be said for 1 or 2 other games I own on here having got the retail edition first such as Kotor or The Witcher.			"

												EDIT: Read comments!*First part has been deleted as it was a nasty rumor started in the forums*With that being said, the game is not completely flawless, it could be optimized a lot and you will encounter bugs or usability problems. Still, I really recommend it, because of the unique gameplay that is fun and at the same time very addicting. It takes a game or two to learn the basics and after that it's very much trial and error. It's a new take on the Zombie survival genre and I enjoyed it a lot.*There's been a few updates since this review was written, so please bear in mind that bugs might have been fixed although I cannot confirm this.*			"

												Zafehouse: Diaries isn't well known for it's moving pictures, but does keep you on your toes with it's survivor management gameplay! In-game, you're typically placed inside a set map filled with typical city buildings of importance; Hospitals, Bars, Houses, Police Stations, ect. You decide where you hold up base, and survive the onslaught of zombie ""X""'s on the map. But they aren't the only one's you'll be fighting out there... The game comes in three different modes, an easy mode which gives you one survivor, and no objective. You're able to signal for others to join your cause and live as a small little group for as long as you can. The medium and hard mode add objectives, as well as a time limit that you need to keep track of - among other problems. The biggest key feature in this is that you can add just about anyone you know into the game - slap in a picture and a persona and you're set! All you need to do after that is spend hours creating your own weapons and armor in the creator menu. Good luck my friend! You're going to need it!			"

												I like this game... but I keep dieing. I like the set up... You never actually see zombies... Its' all in a book... but your decisions affect what happens. Did you decide to go scavenge without sending anyone to check it out first? oops then you did not know how many zombies were in that area.. bad choice!  ya... It can get to you after a bit... Like ... oh no! why did I do that!  but over all it's a really good game. It's easy to get into it even though not much is visually there.. your immagination takes over for you.			"

												Its a simple game that appears well conceived but playing it will make anyone frustrated because many events that occur do not make sense and theres no explanation to it. Relations degrades every turn even tought some of them have compatible personalities just to create an ""end game"". Two people killing 20 zombies outside of your current house when properly equip is easy and with minimal risk but killing 15 zombies in a ""hot house"" like a university with all 5 people armed to the teeth and they will die in the first room the get in. Balance is simply broken. Great that i bought at 1$ price never to play with it again.			"

												The relationship system (that so dominates this shallow little game) was an opportunity to do something interesting.  But it's not interesting, it's terrible.

												Stumbled upon the negative reviews and felt like they were doing some injustice to the game.Is this game worth buying for 4.99€ (1.69€ at the time of writing this review)? Yes.The game portraits 5 survivors with different views on life and occupations trying to survive a zombie apocalypse. To avoid conflicts the player needs to assign chores to survivors based on their abilities and whether they click with others or dont, while racing against time.The game has nice graphics and plays well. While there might have been some ""magic numbers"" at play during some combats, but I take it was just RNG messing with me, I never noticed any bugs whatsoever.All and all, I was entertained and never regretted the decision to buy the game.PS! I also have the game on Desura. :steammocking:			"

												Many may look at this game and think it doesn't look all that good, all that advanced, all that much fun, and they would be wrong.I'll admit I bought Zafehouse Diaries on a whim and I am so glad I did, I am really enjoying playing it.  You have three difficulty options ranging from a casual if still deadly walk-through to a complete Walking Dead, doing everything it takes to survive difficulty and accordingly the challenges you will face are more difficult too to match the level.  The game premise itself is fairly simple, you start off in a building and are required to fortify it, while fighting off hoardes of zombies, other survivors, and each other and are required to search other buildings for supplies, and information about an impeding escape or for parts for the car you hope to fix up to escape (depending ont he level you play).  It is a interesting addictive gameplay, one wrong move can mess up you're game and decimate your survivors but then too cautious  and you risk starving to desk.The ability to customize characters, professions, items (you can find) and some of the in-game pictures is a really great touch too, and while it would be nice to have a few more customizations to add categories of items in it doesn't detract from the variety you have through the customization. Added to this is the is the ability to edit your diary after the game ends which allows you to add a few more details too.Would recommend this game if you're looking for something different to play and hope. Even though they are going on to bigger, better, and moremore advanced projects I really hope Screwfly Studios continue with this game or make a follow up, i did enjoy it that much!!.			"

												I want to love this game, but, unfortunately, it has game-breaking bugs (such as random freezing and crashing during the game, forcing the game to end and not be saved).Tagging along to some of the other reviews, I do strongly agree that there should be a way to equip items to survivors so that you do not need to do it each time you give them an order. You can alter items for the better, but you can't tell your survivors to use them if they're already in a house.For the amount I paid while it was on sale ($1.49), I still can't say it was worth the price. The game feels clunky; constantly needing to equip this and that and if I wanted to see the statistics on a house I raided (say, the number of doors and windows), I would have to actually go through my journal's history to find that information -- it isn't marked for you unlike corpses or located items. If my house is ""Secured,"" why can I continue to barricade it? Am I repairing the previous work? I don't know!It's five dollars of frustration and I really wish I could like this game. I can get past the clunkiness of it all, but the bugs are ending all of my games without warning or ability to prevent them in the future.Sorry, could have been good, but isn't.			"

												I really enjoy this game. It's simple in theory, but very hard to execute and survive, as it should be. There's a reason you hardly see anyone around in zombie apocalypses. The customizable features are Survivors, Occupations (which is where all of the characteristics go into), location photos, and items. The only real problems I see here are the following:Characters always seem to have a problem with a certain type of people, whether it be race or status, and that itself doesn't seem to be customizable, which is a shame, as it seems to have a big effect on how a character feels towards another. Ages are 21-65. Sucks when you want to create kids (and have them be pretty much useless of course), or elderly. I faced this problem when creating Walking Dead survivors, where a few are kids, and Hershel is older than 65. The game itself is interesting. Start with either one survivior, and meet more along the way (perhaps), or start with 5 and try to escape. When personalities battle against eachother, it is largely detrimental to the group's morale and makes it much harder to survive. Every now and then, a randon event will occur, whether it be a group of survivors demanding that your hand over your priest, or a super zombie shows up. Managing the group's resources is challenging, and not gathering new resources will quickly destroy your group. If a survivior is on watch, they will mention the noise level of the group, and that seems to have a huge effect on whether or not zombies will attack. It's a nice realistic feature, and it appears to work. When my group died and the last survivor was a useless woman who couldn't do a thing right, she still survived for many hours in a futile effort to build awful traps. That is, until I ran out of food and sent her out to scavenge more, followed promptly by her death at the hands of zombies.It's not perfect, but it's at a state where it's fun, challenging, and time consuming. I've yet to survive, unfortunately.Two major concerns I see when reading other reviews or posts about this game is about the unrealistic...ness of the personalities and the lack of updates. The personalities aren't perfect, yes, but whoever complains about this seems to think that, in a zombie apocalypse, survivors will immediately band together and work together perfectly, in unison, because of the zombie threat. Definitely sounds like a false premise. As for the updates, they're completely done with the game, but they supplied updates for as long (perhaps even longer) as games normally do, and the product is great as is. If you want a new update, wait for their new game, which pretty much has the same exact premise as this, but in a new scenario.			"

												Win 7 pro 64 - game crashes every few clicks.TL:DR: Very unstable with some questionable UI designs. Not really worth the money as this game is of free armourgames quality. Avoid unless a fan with too much money to waste.If it works you might enjoy this. Game is basically selecting commands from the list of available ones and advancing time to see the results.Most of the times results are not satisfactiony, and your survivors are very likely to die very fast for the reasons like a house having 30 snacks, crossbow, shotgun, dozen of tools but no single bandage or bottle of disinfection liquid.Unbalanced. Sub-par, worse experience than Rebuild 2, no way to customize your own survivor, all is random to the point where it becomes obscene.Not recommended even on sale, put simply it is NOT a good game in any aspects of it.

												This game was something I went in wanting to like. However this game has some very clunky mechanics, and can be rather hard to follow and understand in the begining, which makes it very hard to get into at all. I gave it a little under half an hour of trying it out and gave up and refunded it. Here's hoping they streamline the mechanics just a little for the sequal. The strategy part seems solid, but the rest of the mechanics just bring everything to a halt pretty quickly.			"

												It's not perfect.  Far from it - but it's got some of what I want in a zombie game... none of them ever seem to pull it all together though so I can't complain... too much.  This one's got barricading locations, scavenging for loot that you NEED to survive, tension between the survivors, and permadeath.  It's kind of a tense game, even though it's mostly text based.  I breached a buildiing before scouting it - that was one big mistake.  One final, big mistake.  I sent three in to breach with what I thought were decent weapons and a good chance to make it back out.  Wrong.  So I send in the cavalry with upgraded guns and lot of ammo.  The three from the first group had fallen as the two remaining, wounded (why I didn't send them initially), survivors made it inside.  Then they quickly became - well... not survivors that's for sure.  Oooops.So, negatives.  Yes, the above ""story"" isn't a negative.  Far from it.  My fault for not scouting first.  With ""improved' binoculars... bringing me to a negative.  Modifying normal items to be ""better"" at what they're built to do in the first place.  It's stupid.  I can ""upgrade"" a butter knife.  You mean sharpen it I hope 'cause anything else is going to make it less good at ... buttering.  You can upgrade binoculars.  In a zombie apocalypse.  You can upgrade... binoculars.  Who the fudge has extra powerful lenses laying around for binoculars?  You ""upgrade"" firearms by making them ""steady"", or some other adjective... yeah, think the manufacturers did that already... so yeah, I hate the upgrade system.  Can't pick an item directly either, just upgrade a category of items and you get random bonuses.  Stupidest one I saw so far was upgrading, and get this, weights.  Yup... weights.  How the heck do you upgrade weights in the middle of a zombocaplypse? (that means a zombie apocalypse... it's obvious)  Food consumption and resting are random, as are playing chess, solitaire, drinking, etc.  Not much self control there people, plus they never get along, and I find the relationships to be rather cryptic - plus the ""rumour"" system could be useful to some degree - but I find it clunky.I recommend this for what it is, just make sure you know what this game is before you buy it - and try to get in on sale for crying out loud.  Steam ALWAYS has sales.  Heck, it's 50% off right meow.p.s. I wish I could combine several parts of this game in a blender with DayZ, 7 Days to Die, Rust, Rebuild 1 and 2 (if you haven't tried these, check out Sarah Northway's brainchildren.. and Rebuild 3 on the way), Dead State and State of Decay and have the perfect zombocalypse (I know, not a word - but I like it) game pop out.

												Okay how do I say this. I have probably played over 100 games of this game maybe even 150. I have won a grand total of 4 times one of which was a custom game with people who would work together easier. This game is hard brutal and merciless. However I love it for that. A game that you can feel like the king of the world when you beat it is a awesome game for giving you that feeling eventually. In my opinion this game is a good buy. It can be a little repetitive with certain events but I can almost say with 100% certainty that you will not see every event for along time. If you don't believe me when i say this game is difficult check out the statistics on the website. Only 9 people got their group to the helicopter in time this week (Me being one of them and btw that was the fourth win). This game is a cold heartless b**** but I love it for that. You think the zombie apocalpse would be easy. Good Luck			"

												Now tell me this doesn't sound epic! First of all before we start the game isfully custimizable you can add your own survivors or items like mountain dew or a north face jacket. You can even add yuor own buildings like starbucks or your own house! It was just me when i started out alone with pills a bennie and a coca cola botle with some doritos. I ended up meeting my mom and this random black guy. We cleared out gamestop and my real house. When we cleared out my real house i got a scrach. I enede up infected so i could either get killed or keep me but i would use up most of the meds. So i killed myself and the black guys was sad but pewdiepie didnt care! Then they met some guy who i didnt make he came with the game. For a while my house was great traps and even a watch tower. Than♥♥♥♥♥♥went down real fast. My house got overrun i tried to get pewdiepie to the other house to create a distraction so they would go to that house instead.But pewdiepie died in the process! I tried to get the random guy to go on the watch tower to try and snipe some of the zombies but they got to him to! So then they broke through the front door and the turned random guy took a chunk right out of my moms neck! Black guy then cleared all the dead corpses because our food was rotting fast! than i tried to get the black guy out as soon as possible he didn't make it to the nieghbors house! I tried to get my mom to the neighbors house but right when she got inside she died from a concussion lol. This all happened in less than 1 and a half hours! Now what are you waiting for buy it!			"

												This is not a typical zombie killing game. You do not directly kill zombies nor there is any strategic element in killing zombies. You are, for the lack of better word, the team spirit of the survivors and everything is more or less left to chances. It is a semi-realistic take on a zombie genre... in third person, which gives you the illusion of control along with the frustration that comes with it. You must watch the relationships between the survivors, food level and medical supplies among others. You must guide the survivors through the zombie infested town towards their salvation, which often feels like herding cats. I am not saying Zafehouse is a bad game. Zafehouse is an unique game that offeres a very different experience from other zombie games. It is just not for someone who expects more traditional zombie killing games. I can see how this game can be fun and engaging for some gamers but if you are a casual gamer who just wants to kill zombies like myself, do not buy this game. If, however, you are curious about this game, I suggest that you download the demo version before purchasing this game.			"

												Zafehouse Diaries tries to create a survial text based rpg game that requires tactics and strategy but ultimately fails at it. The concept itself is really great and somewhat different from the usual zombie games but unique doesn't always mean great.The basic premise is to lead a group of randomly generated survivors through various gamemodes and reach the rescue vehicle in order to surive the apocalypse. In order to fulfill your goal you have to overcome various challenges. You need ressources, materials, weapons and supplies. Taking care of your group is a vital aspect because each one of them has their own motivations, political views and character traits which sometimes can cause major trouble in your group. The player has to scavenge various buildings and fight off zombies. Everything is an text based form accompanied by a great interface that feels nice and polished. What makes this game bad is that it's outright boring, the lack of any visual presentation is a really disapointing. The sound assets are weak and there is no real music and just some generic sound effects. There is no atmosphere to speak of or anything exciting. Furthermore the game is outright frustrating, it's really hard to actually complete a campaign. Your strategies and choices always lead to death and it's hard to win even with a group of very good survivors. Overall this game is really boring and doesn't offer anything special. It might be a more realistic approach to the zombie genre but it doesn't deliver. Despite having some customization options, it's not that amazing. Perhaps if you're really into text based rpgs or adventures.			"

												Zafehouse: Diaries was a spur of the moment purchase that I did not regret in the slightest.You play out the apocolypse through a textual interface, manage (or, more likely, fail to manage) the interpersonal relationships between the group of survivors, scavenge and hack your ways through the ravening hordes. It's very easy to grow attached to these survivors, even more so if you add yourself and your friends to the game. That's an easy way to ruin your friendships, by the way. It doesn't matter if your friend Joe didn't ACTUALLY punch your girlfriend Suzy and break her arm, you're probably going to give him the stinkeye for it anyway. But anyway, Zafehouse is a game with a lot of suprises, its interface is elegant and simple to navigate, and there's a real sense of threat.			"

												I have enjoyed this game and highly recomment it. For a week I look forward everday to playing it. I got it on sale +Music+strategy: Challenging and rewarding. I love modding things. Getting an ugraded bat for smashing zombies, priceless+visuals: love the journal+sound: I hear in the background a rustling; is it a zomie? Ah crap I better gets some traps up now... Send my beloved survivor or an assault and hear a squishy sound. ""ah crap a zombie hurt her!!"" lets see what happened. ""oh good just bruises and scrapes."" ""Ahhh a few days later find out she is infected from the scrape!!"" + Replay ability: radomly generated maps, surviors- Easy mode: has no objectives- AI personal confronation: They all act like they are spoiled sweet sixteen year olds. It does not matter if you are 50 year old doctor if sally the 24year waitress uses all the soap you are going to break her arm. Conflicts are waaay to difficult. I often send the most difficult person out to live in another house.Despite the difficutly I reaallly love this game. Visit the community page for helpful hints			"

												This is a great game,i like how there is a editor where you can add your own survivors,Jobs and items. I also like there is a relationship system,but it's sometimes hard to manage the survivors relationship as they fight,argue or being annoyed at other survivors almost all the time. It would be nice if they add a romance and friendship to the relationship system so that it would be more realistic.  "

												I highly recommend this game, but you should know that it is not for the faint-hearted. This game is only for the ""rough and tough,"" those individuals that would actually survive the days after the ""zombocalpse."" This game is one that requires thought, planning, and a balancing act between the attitudes, skills, and oftentimes prejudices of survivors. Something interesting to note is that a survivor's personal bias isn't represented by how another character appears. Example: A survivor might be racist, but that isn't related to the randomized picture of the survivor. While I played, each survivor was different, with different skills and abilities, and frequently the stockpiled items weren't always the same. In one game, I had a solitary character who was distrustful of women. As it happened, a woman showed up who happened to be distrustful of (and not attracted to) men. They were able to work together, though, and after they got disgruntled with one another, I was able to spread a rumor (but since there were just two of them, more like sharing background) that had my male character think more highly of his female co-survivor. There were times when the game didn't seem very intuitive, but there is an online ""step-by-step"" manual offered by the game designers that I found helpful. After playing I also learned that although there were tasks I could have my survivors work on, I didn't need them to work ""24 hours a day."" Rather than constantly be making noise building more and more barricades, they could quietly reinforce their position. And the game was ""warning me,"" but in a roundabout manner. I think this is an incredible game and the interactions between characters, tasks, and difficulties are quite reminiscient of a very popular American television series with similar themes that as of this writing (10/23/2015) is now in it's sixth season.

												Zafehouse Diaries is a game about crashing to desktop, and lack of customization.Other features include:- Developer Abandonment! Devs have completely forgone this game. In leiue of supporting Zafehouse they have opted to make ""Deadnaught"" a clausterphobic game in a completely different Genre.- Non-customizable screen resolution, ""experimental"" options that Crash the game! Break your desktop wallpaper and even break applications running in a dual monitor setup!- Seemingly no autosaves! When the game crashes, enjoy the total loss of progress that ensues! If there is autosaves it's likely as poorly written as the rest of the game.Summary:Zafehouse diaries is a game that COULD have been fun if it was written by competant coders who cared for their customers. If you expect this game to run on any form of modern hardware you're likely expecting to much. If I were to to break the game down into categories I'd rate it thusly:1 - Terrible5 - ExcellentContent: 3 - Characters act like children most of the time, however managing them and taking on the zombies can be real fun, add to that the gamble that is exploration and the game is a reasonable amount of fun, that is if you could actually play it.Graphics: 1 - There is no resolution option, they do give an ""Experimental"" display option, that essentially changes your monitor's display resolution. If you think this sounds like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ implementation of resolution then you're right.Audio: 4 - Audio is fine, nothing groundbreaking but it seems to be (relatively) free from bugs.Final Thoughts:ScrewFly Studios should be renamed to ""Screw You"" Studios. At least it will reflect their attitude towards supporting their games. "

												CRAZY DIFFICULT, CRAZY ADDICTING! You'll be wrestling desperatly with your all but suicidal subjects as you figure out the ins and outs of surviving the zombie apocalypse. One of the best resource management games I've ever played.Should you send person A to scavage food at this little house, or do you risk the longer journey to the warehouse? Should you send the ax to make breaking in easier, or shall he pack light so he can bring more back? Person B would be able to find food faster but he's the best engineer and we need him fortifying the base here! Eh, person C hates his guts anyway. Etc, etc.I ended up making my own custom team with relatively over-powered traits to win (and even then it was a challenge!). Be prepared to get engrossed, fantastic zombie survival strategy simulator.			"

												People in your group get really offended because someone is older or younger, or comes from a more wealthy or educated background. At this point in life, none of that stuff would really matter to anyone, and it is really game breaking as different members will litereally kill eachother in fist fights over this sort of thing. The game is broken in many aspects and it isnt worth buying. There are games out there that are free that handle this type of game in a much better way. Pass this by and try those.			"

In short only buy this game if you can make connections through the characters and the game itself through your head, you need IMAGINATION to enjoy it fully but trust me it is worth it once you put your own survivors in and watch there story unfold.

												It's a nice text based simulation in a zombie apocalypse where you manage a group of random individuals as you try and survive. Like in most zombie apocalypse media you quickly find out the thing to fear isn't zombies but the people who surround you. Managing conflict between members of your group becomes annoying as there isn't much you can do, and more often than not they will end up breaking each other's arms and legs, making it way, way harder to scavenge/fortify/survive.

The game is incredibly fun and, as my prior statements no doubt depict, incredibly challenging.If I had to give this game a rating, it would be 7.75/10.			"

												I do really like this game, I really do. It has a cool way of surviving the zombie attack on the world. The fact that you can make you own weapons (in a way) and even buildings and characters, is awesome. I played this game with a friend of mine and she and I made owerselfs and we had alot of fun. But! There is a ""but"". I wish that this game didn't want to kill you, like at the beginning of the game. When I played it with my friend over 20 times we always had the same problem of, when we wanted to secure a place, the bloody zombies didn't go away even if we made noice in another house or did it in the rain while it was thunfer. No mater what we did (almost all the times, not all) we could not get to fare. I know that zombies and such don't just let us do stuff without attacking but we did all we could to make sure that they could not hear us or see us. I really hope that the people that made this will keep udating it and make DLC's or just add more to the game because it is so much fun. I pay money for this, hell I would almost have paid double the money. I will recommend this game for people that want something different and like zombie games. I will recomend it in general. But if you don't like thinking out of the box or reading, then I will kinda say no because there is alot of reading and thinking that needs to be put on the tabel. You need to read what have happend when you do missions, you need to know your people (characters) and you need to think smart, like what should I do, should I secure my house and then go to the next one or should I get more people first, make them work togheter (make everyone a big happy family <3) and then go secure stuff. There is alot of thinking if you really want to put time and effort into it. And if you feel like it you could roleplay if you feel like it. It was actually kinda fun to do it when I and my friend did it. 6/10 (9/10 if the little problems I said could be somewhat fixed, I don't want it to easy.)			"

												Zafehouse: Diaries was a spur of the moment purchase that I did not regret in the slightest.You play out the apocolypse through a textual interface, manage (or, more likely, fail to manage) the interpersonal relationships between the group of survivors, scavenge and hack your ways through the ravening hordes. It's very easy to grow attached to these survivors, even more so if you add yourself and your friends to the game. That's an easy way to ruin your friendships, by the way. It doesn't matter if your friend Joe didn't ACTUALLY punch your girlfriend Suzy and break her arm, you're probably going to give him the stinkeye for it anyway. But anyway, Zafehouse is a game with a lot of suprises, its interface is elegant and simple to navigate, and there's a real sense of threat.			"

												An interesting difficult game. There are 3 diffrent modes which drasticly effect the difficulty of the game (and they are shown as difficulties). The games general idea is that you either are trying to survive as long as possible, or to get out of the town, via rebuilding a vehicle or waiting/finding out where rescue will come. Each person is given diffrent commands, such as gathering, boarding up a house, watching for zombies, improving equipment. Moving from house to house is dangerous, as it is extreemly risky, you have to fight against the clock, but rushing will get you killed, fast. It is an extreemly tactical game though it can at times be a bit repetative, in the same was as a roguelike can be. Every play through is diffrent, and there is a lot of customization options to put in your own pictures for places and survivors, as well as making custom survivor stats, which can completly change thegame (making it impossible or a walkthrough). Overall if you like tactical games, and don't mind a HELL of a challenge, it's very fun. The only thing I might add is that you have to manage the relationship between your survivors and it can be very very frustrating.			"

												Okay, this game. I've been a Zombie nerd for almost 7 years now. I was a zombie fan before zombies got really popular, not to sound hipster. This game is one of the finest zombie survival games I have ever seen. It plays more like a text based adventure, so there is a lot of reading, but that just adds to the flavor. You control survivors trying to accomplish some sort of task, Survive/Fix a vehicle/Escape, and each challenge is its own difficulty. You control what they do, where they go, and it's just a blast. Nothing is more harrowing to send a survivor off to check a house and find that some helpful person left a map and a crossbow just lying around. I reccomend this game fully, it's one of my new favorites.			"

												Though this game is mostly text and does not contain fanciful 3D graphics, it feels much more immersive than most zombie games I've come across. This game requires you to be careful in planning your every move, at least until you have accumulated enough resources to afford some bravado. It's not an easy game, but only because it tries to be realistic instead of giving the player too much power. Think reality - where things are beyond your control and you have to do your best to improvise and adapt to the situation.			"

But this game is not like the others you have thing to do you just sit there and let them eat the food and die.

Like logic if your not makeing noise no one AND I SAY NO ONE is going to say oh no noise LETS GO BUDDYS!!!!!!!!!.

												$9.95 on steam! This is well worth the price. Are you the type of player who hates easy mode? Well normal mode is like super mega hardcore. The games mechanics are very interesting and makes for a very enjoyable (as long as you're content with losing - often)! Great replayability. This game is highly addictive, and with each failure you start to work out how to survive. If you are looking for a story - and taking your time to plan out your strategy - then pick this game up :)			"

												Needs more gameplay and a workshop to share people, weapons and other things.. townlay outs i guess.  But besides that its pretty fun.. Little short for 9dollars, would save for better sales as well because again it just isn't enough there to justify the price with again lack of gameplay. Add things like being also to build a car in freemode, go to other towns wile risking it breaking down half way which leads to other chainevents with more choices, outcomes and yuupp.. add more please.

												Though this game is mostly text and does not contain fanciful 3D graphics, it feels much more immersive than most zombie games I've come across. This game requires you to be careful in planning your every move, at least until you have accumulated enough resources to afford some bravado. It's not an easy game, but only because it tries to be realistic instead of giving the player too much power. Think reality - where things are beyond your control and you have to do your best to improvise and adapt to the situation.			"

												Zafehouse: Diaries was a spur of the moment purchase that I did not regret in the slightest.You play out the apocolypse through a textual interface, manage (or, more likely, fail to manage) the interpersonal relationships between the group of survivors, scavenge and hack your ways through the ravening hordes. It's very easy to grow attached to these survivors, even more so if you add yourself and your friends to the game. That's an easy way to ruin your friendships, by the way. It doesn't matter if your friend Joe didn't ACTUALLY punch your girlfriend Suzy and break her arm, you're probably going to give him the stinkeye for it anyway. But anyway, Zafehouse is a game with a lot of suprises, its interface is elegant and simple to navigate, and there's a real sense of threat.			"

												A fun addictive game that leaves you craving more. The difficulty can be a bit to overcome but overall leaves you satisfied when you finally beat a game mode. The easiest mode can sometimes turn out to be the hardest depending on what the game generates. Custom character creation and custom job creation make it also a blast. Politics within the group can cause a ton of events to turn out for the worse as well so you have to watch relationships. Happy people teach each other kung fu or whatever and mad people just throw furniture and break legs/arms. The food system could use some work because right now you can't ration meal size or tell them when to eat. Be prepared to scout out for a lot of food and make sure you assault a big location several times before actually breaching it. A lot of times your stupid survivor will estimate about 5 zombies in the place when it turns out there was a horde of 30. You will die a lot learning the game but that's what makes a game fun.			"

												Zafehouse: Diaries could be fun... but it's just too random, unforgiving, and brutal. Each of those aren't typically a problem individually but together they make the game frustrating. Even ""cheating"" and creating ""perfect"" occupations I lost after three days from pure random chance. It's hard, but not a fun hard. Just a frustrating ""I guess I'll just start over"" hard.			"

												An enjoyable ""tactical zombie apocalypse life simulator"". I found the events to be interesting and the social balance to be a challenging and thoughtful affair, but a lot of deaths seem cheap and there are some real opportunities they missed when it comes to the core of the gameplay experience.Still a solid coffee-break style game you play on the side while you wait for something else to finish downloading.

												This is a great game,i like how there is a editor where you can add your own survivors,Jobs and items. I also like there is a relationship system,but it's sometimes hard to manage the survivors relationship as they fight,argue or being annoyed at other survivors almost all the time. It would be nice if they add a romance and friendship to the relationship system so that it would be more realistic.  "

												One of those exceptions to the rule of: ""Do not touch story based style games with a ten foot pole"". It actually does draw you in and I never regretted the hours I spent trying to come out alive (at least once ffs).No such luck yet.Luckily it is a game I can come back to year after year without OD-ing on outdatedness,so I consider it money well spent.Recommended? Yep. "

												Pros -The graphics are immersive and bring the story to life.Random events keep things from getting too monotonous.The custom content generator lets you personalize the apocalypse. Put together some character from pop culture and you've basically got Total Drama Island with zombies.Cons - The audio starts out strong, but gets annoying fast. The audio levels are also unpredictable.Game mechanics are never explained clearly, so every fight feels like a coin toss.It's hard to tell how useful high level gear is.Character relationships don't feel authentic, and consequences for negative relationships feel over the top.Using custom content disables achievements. TL;DR: a poor strategy game, but a good story generator. I recommend getting it on sale if you have the patience.			"

												This game looks like it will be fun.  Hard, randomized start, lots of options, but in reality, it is a diceroller with no logic.  No autosaves and a random crash that erases any progress made, make this game extremely bad. "

												There is a free flash game called rebuild, it even has a sequel. It's basically the same game minus the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ survivor mechanics, but better.I would really like to enjoy this game, but it is so front loaded against you. That I could handle, in a more traditional roguelike setting. Alas there simply is not enough tools at your disposal to handle the relationship dynamics with the survivors in this, or at least they may be there, but they are not available soon enough.			"

												People in your group get really offended because someone is older or younger, or comes from a more wealthy or educated background. At this point in life, none of that stuff would really matter to anyone, and it is really game breaking as different members will litereally kill eachother in fist fights over this sort of thing. The game is broken in many aspects and it isnt worth buying. There are games out there that are free that handle this type of game in a much better way. Pass this by and try those.			"

												CRAZY DIFFICULT, CRAZY ADDICTING! You'll be wrestling desperatly with your all but suicidal subjects as you figure out the ins and outs of surviving the zombie apocalypse. One of the best resource management games I've ever played.Should you send person A to scavage food at this little house, or do you risk the longer journey to the warehouse? Should you send the ax to make breaking in easier, or shall he pack light so he can bring more back? Person B would be able to find food faster but he's the best engineer and we need him fortifying the base here! Eh, person C hates his guts anyway. Etc, etc.I ended up making my own custom team with relatively over-powered traits to win (and even then it was a challenge!). Be prepared to get engrossed, fantastic zombie survival strategy simulator.			"
