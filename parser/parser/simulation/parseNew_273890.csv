												1) The truck never slides or skids on icy roads.2) It's physically impossible to crash the truck anyways.Quick Look:

			You can't crash the truck and the icy roads have no noticeable effect on the truck's handling. Shame on you for endorsing this Alex Debogorski, you used to be my hero.

												Seriously, this game is as bad as it gets. Why anyone would think this is worth £7 is beyond me. Im just glad i got the key for free.The only positive side are the trees, they actually look OK. The interior of the truck is a joke. Alex must be hard of cash to endorse this. Because its dog balls. And to the screenshot that says numerous settings... there maybe 10 settings, 3 of which are audio! Anyway here is a short first look. Hopefully it puts you off buying this junk. Enjoy :)

												Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!This is another trash simulator  game.Interface/Menu/SettingsNone.About the game.Just another simulator game.. Ohh.. these games have a nice thing in common. Trying to milk the customer by offering a not completed game. Just avoid. But... You can drive around which is ofcourse expected. You can do some missions, upgrade your truck, getting new trucks and so go on. You can't drive backwards which is weird but hey i am not a trucker.There is a music/Engine/ambient and weather effect volume slidebar.You can play the game with a controller.You can change the keyboard controls.Game is boring, World design is boring.There are some resolution sizes available.You can play in fullscreen mode or windowed mode.You can toggle the music.You have a minimap at the bottom corner.Other things.It is kinda obvious why the game is bad.. OH that is probaly because of ""Simulator"" in it. <.< Just another buy-bait Simulator and those kind of games really need to stop.-------------------I Give this game a 1/10			"

												Spend the extra money and get Euro Truck Simulator 2.  I got this game for cheap and I still feel ripped off.This game feels like Euro Truck Sim, but without the fun, atmosphere, and beautiful graphics.This is in no way worth $8.  The top speed you'll ever reach is 30 and the map is extremely small.This looks like an early, early, early, alpha demo for Euro Truck Sim.  DO NOT PURCHASE.There is no way at all that I can recommend this garbage.  Save your money.			"

I can recommend just to take a look, see what you think yourself.Like trucks? Your good.Dont like trucks? Safe your money, buy something else.			"

												i only have hazy memoies of watching ice road truckers on the history channel years ago, but the fact that some old canadian trucking veteran has endorsed this no-budget simulator made by a bunch of germans is hilarious to me.at least this game is optimized compared to extreme roads usa. that game runs like a mud fetishist going through a bog.
