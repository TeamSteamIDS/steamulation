												An outstanding flight simulator for those WW2 freaks. I've been playing the IL2 series since the first iteration, and with these expansions, this is by far the greatest piston flight simulator ever made. Even though it was released in 2006 and sometimes feels like it, the gameplay is still tight, flight models are still amazing, damage models realistic, and editor still the greatest ever made. Multiplayer is nonexisteant without using Hyperlobby, but that is free software. The dynamic campaigns are serious fun and can eat up hundreds of hours, and the sheer volume of them means you'll never run outAlso. Members of the dev team are STILL updating the game. Just in October, they added 3 new aircraft and a large number of features. There have been hundreds of patches which fix even tiny bugs. The community is HUGE, and replayabillity is paramount.There's a reason why this game has the most hours of play out of my entire library.			"

												I remember picking this game up back when I was a kid, and thinking that this is the best flight simulator to date. I logged a couple hundred hours with the hard copy of the game way back when. Then I just stopped playing for whatever reason. Later on I noticed that it was for sale on steam. Time to give it another shot I guess. Might as well burn a few more hours into it. Then when I loaded up the game I noticed a whole bunch of extensions tacked onto it. Some that I never even heard of. So I started up a quick dogfight with my usual Spitfire, and Tally-HO! Even to this day I feel as though this game is still in it's prime for an old WW2 Flight sim. Not only does this game give you endless hours of missions, dogfights, bomb runs, and flight support. Now you can extend your gameplay by creating your own missions in the full mission builder! And with endless aircraft to choose from, you're pretty much in it for the long-run. I cannot simply find enough time to try everything out in IL-2. It's just that good!			"

												I began my career as Lt Hanz Schmit.Being assigned to 109's defending the fatherland against thee communist invaders on the eastern front. I was the best of my squadron unit with 46 kills ranging from bombers to attackers to fighters, i began to lead the missions onto enemy territory but as the years passed, i began to realise the war was lost.In the spring of 45' i began to fly the 262. The skies above were covered by the four engined menaces heading to bomb the cities where our families resided.A tough fight ensued, we took heavy casualties but brought down most of the bonbers. Then it happened.Left engine failed due to overheat and the aircraft plummeted toward the earth.I jumped out as the aircraft as the left wing separated from tge main body and parachuted relatively safely on the ground bellow. Seconds later, my character was stiken by the loose wing from the skies above, ending the life of my brave little soldier. Best. Sim. Ever.			"

												Decided to try and dog fight at 10000 feet on Normandy. After destroying 4 A-20 bombers, I then decided to drop down to about 1000-2000 feet to get a better view of the map. Now I am no pilot from the 1940s and this proved it because in my mind I figured the best way down was to just point the nose down and drop. This was a mistake. Around 4000 feet, my engine stopped and my left flap had literally sprung off the plane. I ended up gliding until I reached Caen and then crashed landed....all in all this is just utterly fantastic as a flight simulator and a dog fight game.2000 feet out of 2000 feet.			"

												The Pe-8 was a Soviet four-engine heavy bomber used during the Second World War. As the default list goes in the game it carries one of the most powerful munitions in the form of the FAB-5000, a 5000kg conventional bomb.As I was flying I flew low and dropped this munition because I'm stupid and didn't map my bombsight controls. My ventral gunners were killed instantly, all four engines burst into flames, and I was sent to a fiery death at an altitude of 400 meters.11/10 would doom aircrew again.			"

												It may be eight years old, but IL-2 1946 still holds a candle to more recent sims on the market. It's an affordable entry into the world of flight simulators, and has something to offer the novice as well as the experienced enthusiast. While DCS and other titles that share the philosophy of its developers opt for maximum realism, IL-2 exceeds in the area of bredth without sacrificing the depth and detail necessary for a proper sim. The amount of aircraft and maps included is impressive, and combined with the active modding and tweaking scene, the possibilities for fun and engaging scenarios are huge. For the low price, you're getting a game that's polished with realism, variety, and accessibility. It is my WWII sim of choice.			"

												I am not going to lie, these graphics will seem ancient to most of you but that is just one ""con"" in an entire ocean of ""pros"". If you are in any way interested in flight, world war two and realism, i would give this game a go because the content of the game in my honest opinion is worth far more than the $10 is is sold at. The flight physics will hold up against most flight sims of these times (not to mention that the game it's self both physics and content is constantly being worked on despite the games release some 7-8 years ago). ontop of that this game is also compatible with the head tracking device ""trackIR"" making it all the more fun and realistic.On another note i do not recommend this simulator to anyone without a joystick becuase you will find it incredibly hard to control even the most basic manoeuvers because of such realistic events as ""stall and spin"". All in all this flight sim is by far one of the most complex, in depth, realistic i have ever played only being topped by DCS but had it been for a WW2 sim only, Il-2 Sturmovik would take 1st place any day.

												I don't think I've EVER had so much fun with a WWII flight simulator of any kind, even WarThunder (which i've put something like 700-800 hours into. Yikes). I mean, for a game made in 2000, IL2 1946 is downright magnificent. Quite frankly, the dorks at Gaijin could learn some lessons from the visuals of this game - a lot of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ default aircraft models and textures from 15 years ago look better than the defaults in WarThunder! The aircraft selection is awesome, ranging from early derpy Polish monoplanes to the finest of Luft-46 German technology (to satisfy all of those Wehraboos...you know who you are). Aside from the occasional game crash and a few kinks that were pretty easily ironed out, this game is fantastic for what it costs. 10/10 would buy again.			"

Basic InformationTitle:  IL-2 Sturmovik 1946Developer:  1C: Madd0x GamesPublisher:  iC-777Genre:  Flight SimulatorGeneral ImpressionSturmovik 1946 is one of the best WW2 combat flight sims in recent years and I have been playing it in one version or another, almost since its launch. In its current 1946 edition, you have a whopping number (229) of planes to choose from as well as dynamic campaigns for almost every theatre of operations from that war. The amount of setting customization is also an integral part of this game. You can never claim that it might be too difficult since you can tweak the options until you play an almost arcade version. And yet, this title is best played on a flightstick. The mouse and keyboard do a decent job, but they are far from ideal and this game takes some time getting used to, especially with the taking off and landing parts (both skippable). Age had taken its toll on the general aspect, but Sturmovik 1946 is far from bland looking and the sound score fits the game perfectly.Strong Points+ Nice graphical details.+ Excellent diversity in both missions/campaigns and in the airplanes themselves.Weak Points- No Steam Trading Cards or Achievements.Rating 9/10 This review was submitted for SUPER Giveaways.

												One of the best in (WW2) flightsims I've seen, with varying difficulty that you can customise in details and plenty of mods available to change up your experience. This is the one I'd recommend if anyone wants to get a flightsim.Grab a joystick(Keyboard flying is possible, but can't beat a joystick), take off and go on a long campaign that can be lengthened further by mods, or just fly around in random battles. The only thing I can think of that this game doesn't do right is the AI, who seems perfectly fine with flying straight at an AA gun in formation while it is shooting them for over 30 minutes straight, and missing every last shot. Other than that, I've not found much wrong with it.Multiplayer took me a bit to get working, but it's worth itGood damage modeling, good flight models, and it's pretty to look at as a bonus.

												IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 is a game unlike many, and this can be for better or for worse. If you get this game, one of the first things that you will notice about it, is that it isn't exactly the easiest game to learn to like. The tutorials that are available to you do not put you at the controls of the aircraft you're being taught to fly, but rather make you watch another person fly it the way it's supposed to be flown. Really, the only true way you can learn to play the game is to start it up, and begin playing it immediatly. No tutorials, no help. Trust me, you will die. A lot.I'm going to go ahead and tell you the things that you likely won't like about this game at first. 1: There are no ""Real"" tutorials that teach you how to play as I've said before, meaning the only way for you to learn to play the game is through jumping right in.2: The controls and flight characteristics are very realistic, meaning that if you haven't played a Flight Simulator before, there are hundreds of ways that you can screw yourself over without actually getting into combat, such as putting yourself into a Flat Spin, Stalling Out, Ripping Your Wings, Overheating Your Engine, etc.3: There can literally be a use for every single button on your keyboard, meaning that hitting one wrong button can mean instant death.4: This game is unbelievably difficult to master in terms of everything, from flight controls to maneuvers to landing.With all of these negativities said, it doesn't sound like a very fun game, now does it? That's where you're wrong. I believe that the people that made this game were absolute geniuses. This is the number one thing about this game - you need to be patient. You will die several times before actually learning to kill anything, but once you do learn, once the little mechanism inside your brain clicks with this game, it will be one of the most fun World War Two Flight Simulators you've ever played. The Bottom Line is, this game isn't for people that give up easily. This game is for people who are patient, and people who are willing to learn. Do I recommend this game? Yes, yes I do, but only if you are willing to learn the complexities of it. If not, then don't waste your time with it.			"

												An actual SIMULATOR of WWII aerial combat. By default this is not your faint of heart arcade flight game, though with difficulty settings players can modify the game to be more accommodating for their play styles. The game is detailed  and offers a lot of different period authentic airplanes, though this came from many years of patching and updates; it still remains one of the go to for more realistic flight simulator enthusiasts.  I sadly can not recommend the Steam version to the CD version as most mods do not mix well with this version.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU BUY THE CD BOX SET and download your choice in a great variety of community made content.  The Steam version is still supported and played online though, you will need ""Hyper-Lobby"" to view games.			"

												If you love combat simulators then this is the game for you.  You can easily customize your flight controls to make it as easy or realistic as you want.  This game is suitable for the newbie as well as the veteran flyer.  Tons of plans and factions to choose from not just the standard USA, USSR, Germany and Great Britain.  Even though this is an older game the graphics for the plans and cockpit look extremely good.  In addition there is a ton of customizable options for your plans, including nose art, camo sets, weapons, etc.  However, if you dont have a joystick it will be a bit tricky, but you can use a corded xbox 360 controller if you need too.  Over all, I this is a great game, well worth the money, especially when it goes on sale.			"

												""Il-2 Sturmovik: 1946"" originally began as an Eastern Front flight combat simulator which branched into Europe, The Pacific and then into the immediate Post-war Jet era. It has become a bit of a cult following with several loyal players continually playing, hosting, creating skins, missions and campaigns. It is probably one of the longest running dedicated combat sims which though using a limited and dated engine, is still able to satisfyingly emulate the widest scope of aviation combat centered around World War 2 in varying difficulty levels and complexity. It has over 150 flyable aircraft from varying aspects of nearly all theaters of operations as well as associated maps. It includes pilot campaigns from nearly all sides, a quick mission builder and a full mission builder. But most of it's contemporary strengths come from beautifully made skins, missions, campaigns and utilities from it's many followers and fans that run the gamut of historical to flights of fantasy. It's latest version is 4.12.2m (which is the latest steam version - No patching needed!) which has been officially updated by a group called Team Daidalos (rumor has it they are even working on 4.13!) has added flyable aircraft, tweaked graphics and sounds and additional mission building options and objects. (it even now has the option to add 3rd party ""Online sounds"" and still be a 'stock' game) It's multiplayer capability is via Hyperlobby where you can usually fly and/or host missions, join dedicated server maps, or get limited help from people there.Besides the stock game, many have added one of the popular mods to add even more popular aircraft, different flight models, digitized sounds, improved graphics and mission building options and objects. (Most mods can be switched to stock easily via a simple program).It has the added advantage of being able to run smoothly (A critical point in combat flight sims) on most older systems.oh, I have purchased 2 retail box versions and the steam version so I've played a bit more than 10 minutes..  :)(I have ""Il-2:Cliffs of Dover"" and ""Il-2: Battle of Stalingrad"" and I still enjoy ""Il-2 Sturmovik:1946)			"

												One of the best WWII and Post WWII Flight Simulators ever. Hundreds of planes to fly, hundreds of maps (campaign, multiplayer, etc.), hundreds of custom done ground targets, AA and etc. (with a great editior!) and hundreds of hours you will spend playing this game. I played the original IL-2 4-5 years after it came out (around 2005, 2006) and it became one of my favorite games to play. IL-2 1946 brings all that great stuff and it lives on in this game. Again, you will play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game outside of my previous comments for other reasons such as below...MODS: The modding community is friendly, resourceful and spectacular. Modders have added in new systems to the game (bug fixes, flight dynamics, gun dynamics, etc.) They have also added in many new aircraft of all eras of flight; WW1, MORE WW2, Korea, Vietnam, and other Cold War Aircraft.COMMUNITY: With a living and breathing community that continues to strive today after almost 15 years after the original game coming out, this game has a small, but active community. With Hyperlobby providing custom dedicatd servers with custom gamemodes and a clan servers that are still active to this day. The clans are fun with custom operations outside of their public server with huge and long campaigns will full and intricate operations- all with real people going against AI or each other. Fantastic game, I love this game and its community. 10/10			"

												Written as of 25 August, 2016.I grew up with this game, so I may be severely biased, just a warning. I remember getting the original IL-2 Sturmovik/Pacific Fighters pack way back in 2005 as a starry-eyed little kid. I was fascinated with aircraft from this era and it's the main reason I know how much about them I do today. And then, suddenly, this new, vastly superior version appeared! I never begged my parents for something so badly in my life, but I NEEDED this as a child. And so I made the money to buy it. Best idea ever. It doesn't show it, but the amount I have played this game in so many situations must easily be at least 4,000 hours before getting it on Steam alone. But enough of my life story, let's get into the review of this.What makes this game appeal to someone like me? Vast amounts of aircraft stock in the game, hundreds of AI ground/naval vehicles to populate maps, and the fact that there's actually a very intuitive mission maker within the game itself. Throw in one of the newest massive modpacks (CUP/HSFX/DBW/etc.) and you're suddenly thrown into a game with hundreds of aircraft, amazing graphics, great missions, historical skins, and even more ground/naval cannon fodder. I greatly appreciate the attention to detail (especially for a game released in 2006) and historical value of this game. Some things aren't perfect, but hell, this was released almost a whole decade ago and is still rated as one of the best WWII Combat Flight Simulators out there.Well, that's great and all, but what are some dislikes? Well, I would say the graphics are fairly bad, but I cut it major slack for being made in 2006. There's also the incessant lawnmower for 90% of stock aircraft engines. Plus that music. I love the original 2003 vibes of the original and Pacific Fighters combined, but after playing both for 11 years, that has gotten under my skin to the point of muting the music. Some of the controls are difficult to master, and the game itself takes years to master. Hell, when I first started the series, it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. The tutorials and such are honestly shoddy and you really can't play this well without a joystick, but with even a low quality one in your hands, you can become proficient. All of my dislikes besides the joystick near-necessity (not really a complaint in my opinion) are with the stock game, and mods 100% cure all.Pros:Held up to time amazingly wellCan be very relaxingAmazing 3D models (for the time)Great flight characteristicsIn-game mission editorMillions of options for custom missionsNear-overwhelming amounts of mods due to roughly 10 communities, creating a very customizable environmentCons:Graphics (Can be easily modded)Sounds and Music (Again, mods)Lack of hands-on tutorialsAlmost requires joystick (But it's a simulator, not some arcade game)Overall:9/10. My all-time favorite WWII FCS, and one I've easily sunk thousands of hours into before adding to Steam. Supreme amounts of replay value, obscene amounts of content, and the best installment (personal opinion) in the series that set the foundation for modern WWII Flight Combat Simulation games to this day.

												I was casually flying my P-51 when i spotted a German missile flying, i decided to chase it and shoot it down. i matched speeds with it and landed a couple shots, which made it go on fire. i was really impressed by it and kept watching it closely for a little while. 10 seconds later i thought to my self ``wait a second, rockets explode when on fire!``  and right after that it exploded taking me with it. One of the best gaming moments i ever hadJUST BUY IT ALREADY			"

Need to sign up onto some seedy server web site just to find oneOver all, its easy to see why this game is a legend. Not a bad investment. Just wish modding was more simple and that MP worked.			"

												Just want to say I love this game, but this is less of a review and more of a tutorial for new players.SHORT VERDICTGreat game, remmended!IL-2 is one of my favorite flight simulator games of all time, I still owned the game on disk. When I saw it on steam I knew I had to get it and so far im not dissapointed. Im running Windows 10 and i`ve encounered no problems with it, I hope its the same for you if your looking to purchase. Another heads up is that there is no mouse joy( you can`t use a mouse to fly), its fine for me beacuse I have a joystick but you will need either that or a controller (if supported) You will also need to have a thorough look at the controls. Game can be very difficult at times, remember to find FOV in the options menu and set some keys to increase or decrease the FOV. Also have a look at the difficulty setting, there you can change things like blackouts and redouts, realistic pilot damage, head shake, etc. If you are in a struggle tweak around at the settings. Graphics still sort of hold up, its really not bad, there is no shading but still manages to look good. When you first get into the game set up the game with the controls and setting you want. then head into either the tutorials or head into quick mission builder, here you can pick where you want to fight, who you want to fight and you can choose from a large variety of planes. There are a total of 4 nations to choose from.If you are looking to buy this game, I hope this will help you, the only reason I made this ""review"" is because I saw people raging in the reviews cus they had no idea what was going on. Anyways IL-2 is still a lot of fun to this day and I still enjoy a battle now n then. I love this game a lot and hope you do too.			"

												I was into flying the mighty soviet Yak-1 plane against the German Luftwaffe, my glorious mission was to escort the invincible Sturmovik's that were made of Stallinium, I did not question why these indestructible planes even needed our escort, I was just happy to serve for the motherland and make Stalin proud! it was my very first sortie after all, I had to make good impressions!After about 30 minutes of flying, we finally crossed the border into enemy territory, I knew this meant that we would face the enemy soon, so I decided to check my fuel gauge, to make sure I had enough fuel to accomplish the mission and return back to the motherland, in the 30 seconds that it took me to find that damn fuel gauge, I realized something, my comrades were shouting into their radio's for some blasted reason, I decided to look up to see what was wrong, only to realize that my mighty Yak-1 plane was for some odd reason diving very quickly towards the ground! I quickly pulled as hard as I could on my stick to get the plane out of the dive, but it didn't work! I was at a loss! pressing the F2 key revealed something I was not quite expecting...  apparently a German FW-190 fired a cannon round into my Yak-1 and tore it in half, the rest of my Yak-1 was was gone, no wings, no tail, no weapons, I decided to bail out of my flying glass box, only to realize something else, I was 100 feet from the ground and 1 second later, I was dead.10/10 "

												This is the Definitive staple of all air combat games, a timeless classic, belonging in all  combat flight sim collections.Even today in this year, 2017, there are those of us who refuse to stop flying on our heavily modded copies of the beloved, iL2-1946. Please consider that the stock game is in no way expected to impress you. if you really do wish for the full experiece of it all, you must consider that there will be a lengthy processes of of downloading and installing patches, and not without reading a couple of freindly forums, where you should find the instructions on getting everything up-to-speed.please also note that the steam-edition has often been cited as NEEDING ADDITIONAL STEPS IN INSTALLATION AND SETUP, and may require a special patch.

												This game is probably one of the best combat flight sims i have played.There is a steep learning curve, the training videos don't do much to help,  you basically have to figure out how to fly on your own.  The aircraft selection is massive so there is bound to be something you'll like flying. (my personal favourite is the Spitfire Mk.IX series. ) You can change the difficulty settings to configure the game from a semi-realistic flight game to a hardcore sim.  In the Campaigns (some of which are dynamic) you can find yourself dogfighting over the lakes of Finland, intercepting bombers over Stalingrad, operating from carriers at Midway, escorting B-29s over Japan and much more.The game is old so the Graphics aren't insane but gameplay-wise it's awesome.Despite most the negative reviews, you do not need any kind of specialist equippment like Joysticks, Rudder pedals or Track IR.  My friend, Shas'O Bongosun, (who has flown over 200 hours in the game.) only uses keyboard and mouse and he's a good pilot.  Personally i have used a simple joystick for a while but it is not needed,  I've used the keyboard since the originial IL-2 .			"

I have also seen alot of reviews that say this game is a buggy mess.. well it has its bugs but its not as bad as they say. and finaly if you don't like a game with a big learning curve don't buy, although you do get a massive feel of acomplushment when you shoot down your first fighter after a 10 minute dog fight on maxed difficulty. 10/10 such an amazing thrill			"

												How may I briefly describe the many years of joy I've accumulated from this lovely and charming simulator?I know she's long-in-the-tooth, and she's been through many missions, arrived back at base riddled and missing parts of her, but in no time I'm back with her, sitting knowingly in the cockpit:She's my B-17 baby doll! My sexy P-38 Lightning!My sassy Spitfire vixen over the white cliffs of Dover! She's my 109 and 190 dodging tracers over a Crimean Winter! She's my brave female Russian pilot in the versatile La-5FN!She's the wingman to Sakai! Zeroing in with the Zero...The Flying Tiger...She's a Black Sheep in a Corsair!Or she's an Me-262 jetting about tangling with the Cadillac of the sky, the famous P-51!She's the Ilyusha! The Hunchback! The Flying Tank! The Flying Infantryman! She's the IL-2!She's a pre-war warbird, an early warbird, mid-war warbird, late warbird, and a post-war warbird...You can find her on all fronts in all factions. Graphically crusted, and with the Gremlins keeping mechanical failures to a minimum, and with a few MODifications, the IL-2 1946 engine is purring, staying alive for another mission over enemy territory.

												It's a game that's running on 2001 technology, and man, does it still look pretty good.  If you're planning on getting any of the IL-2 games (or any historic plane combat simulator), go with this one first.  Extremely fun, with plenty of realism options and settings that you can customize to your own personal liking.  There's a buttload of planes to start out with, you can build missions or choose campaigns...you'll be playing it for a while.  If you don't like the aging graphics, or you want to get more out of the game, don't worry: there are countless, I repeat, countless mods that you can download to expand the content or improve the look of the game.  You'll be playing it for a while.			"

												I, like most people, had this game on disk before getting this. What made me get this is after years of not playing it I tried the disk again but found the resolution had a super low limit. So I then looked up this, finding it supports modern resolutions PLUS had way more planes. Maybe not way more but they are cool. Il-4 (My favorite), SM79, Pe-8... Now just needs the Me-323, My all time favorite. Graphics: Now they are ""dated"" but they still look good. Its not Il-2 Battle of Stalingrad good but still. Anyways I think Il-2 BoS is a shame to Il-2. 80$ for 11 planes with 1 you cant fly?!  I build kits alot too so this goes along with what I like.Rating: Probably one of the best games Ive ever played.			"

												I had the original CD version of this game many years ago with many flight hours invested. When I found it on Steam and all the community interest in modding for it I immediately bought it.This is one of the best WWII flights sims available even 10 years later. It has many aircraft, single missions and even multiple campaigns to choose from. Thanks to the modding community there are many comprehensive mod upgrades for this game. Graphics, sound and flight characteristic improvements in the community mods that make this game almost the visual eye-candy that IL-2: Battle of Stalingrad is. The thing about IL-2 1946 is it covers all aspects of WWII flight combat from The Battle of Britain, The Western Front, Africa, The Eastern Front and all the Pacific battles. There are many aircraft to choose from and with the community mods the aircraft fly and look spectacular. 12.4.2 is the latest and probably last version of this game, which is what you get when you purchase this from steam. I personally use HSFX mod for this game and you can easily find download information on the net or through YouTube videos for install. It’s very easy and mainly just a few downloads and easy install instructions.Make sure you have a flight stick. Even though you can fly without one its recommended. Take the time to setup your flight stick in-game and you will not be disappointed with this game. I run this game on my Windows 10 system with no problems at all.This is positively a must have if you are a flight sim enthusiast, especially WWII.			"

With stuff like DCS and even new IL-2s coming out, this one is definitely starting to show its age, if only in the multiplayer department. However it is still an old classic of the genre. Pick it up if you like your flight sims with a side shot of vodka when its on sale, and I doubt you'll be disappointed.			"

												IL-2 Sturmovik and me go way back to 2002, about a year after the original came out. Used to fly around in my BF-109 and wreak havok on the skies, destroying ME-262's as quickly as they came. I was 7 then.Then I lost the disk and I was crushed, my favorite game was lost. It took me 8 years to find another copy at the bottom of the ""unwanted"" bin (let's face it, those piles of games just sitting there in those boxes? They're mostly junk with a few flecks of gold every now and then) at Wal-Mart, and I was in love all over again.Then I found 1946. I had heard about it while surfing Ubisoft back in '10 and I was instantly hooked, and that was before I realized that it came with EVERY IL-2 ever released before 2007!Now I terrorize the skies in my P-38L and I couldn't be happier! Plus the lads at SAS and thier modding community always come up with something to make IL-2 interesting (BF-109 and FW-190 super packs, an MI-24V Hind etc).10/10 all day every day and twice on Sunday!

This is a very good game,arcade if that is what you want,sim if thats your style or something in between.There are dozens of aircraft to fly , dozens to fight ,its staggering just how many of both there are.Though ""old"" it still looks  good enough graphically.You can play as heaps of different nations rather than just the usual  British,German,Japanese,or US of A,hell you can even play as a New Zealander.This is one seriously good game for anyone with an interest in WW11 aviation.

												I've only recently buy the steam version, however, I've been flying in IL-2, 1946 for 8 years now, so don't let the playing time fool you.This is one of the best, if not outright the best, civilian-grade combat flight simulator one can find these day. Although some other, like Battle of Stalingrad, has better graphic and physics (it's almost a decade now, of course physics gonna be improved), none have the same feeling, planes diversity, combat diversity, location, as 1946 has to offer. The flight sim itself can be set to multiple level of realism, allowing new rookies to take control with confident while learning to fly with easy flying mode, and allowing hardcore ace to feel the wind flow through the wing, to feel the recoil, and to feel the aircraft itself with full realistic setting.Okay, what I mean ""easy mode"" is that it's a simplified mode. It's not a face-pace arcade mode like War Thunder. The mission is the same as full realistic setting, only simplified some matter, like no spinning. Also, no aiming helper either. If you're looking for War Thunder's alternative, you're coming the wrong way. IL-2 1946 is far more realistic than War Thunder.Beside, another advantage is that they're freaking LOTS OF PLANES!!! More than 10 of Yak-9 subtype, 20 of Spitfire's subtype, dozen of A6M family, lots of Bf-109, etc, most come as realistic as you could find, and some paper planes are also fitted well within the game. Which mean you could made an alternate scenario mission with these plane if you like.Oh, did I mention large amount of mods avalable? Some of them give a new graphic, some add EVEN MORE PLANES, some hoes as far as Korean war (heard that someone made an F-86H with Sidewinder as well), and lots of possibility.So, if you want a not-so-hard flight sim, with low graphic requirement, lots of planes, and adaptability, I personally recommend this sim for you.Safe flying, everyone.Dr. Galactose			"

												IL2 sturmovik remains as one of the best combat flight simulators i have ever played. its not over complicated and you wont spend hours mapping every control and trying to remember them but it is hard core enough to keep fans of the genre happy. there was never a moments while playing it when i thought ""that wouldnt happen in real life"".

												After realizing my last review looked like complete sh!t, I've decided to re-do it and make it simple.Pros:-Great Aircraft Selection.-Easy Controls, I used a mouse and keyboard, and still had a blast.-Fantastic Damage Model, you can actually see bits and pieces, plus the pilot bailing out of his aircraft after you obliterate him.-Engaging combat, the AI sure know how to get the blood flowing.-Large map selection.-Dynamic Campaign, which is very, very unique, you can play as someone in a certain rank, in a squadron, or work your way up, there's even a bit of RP elements, as you can change your picture, personally, I changed mine to a s3xy pin-up model, gotta give some lovin' to those hotties.-Very well optimized, I never crashed once.Cons: -Somewhat dated graphics, however that's understandable, the game is like 11 years old, and there's mods to fix that issue.-The AI can be really stupid at times, missing ground targets almost everytime, whether with a bomb, rocket or machine guns, or how big the target is, the AI can miss it completely if there's not enough planes attacking a target. They're better at carpet-bombing and torpedoeing.-A few missing planes from the aircraft selection, I unfortunately didn't see any P-40Ms, or any F8F Bearcats, still a very wide selection, again, most of it can be fixed with mods.To sum it up, with how many pros I gave this game, this game doesn't lack in anything really, it does it's job, an air combat sim. I found it hard to find any negatives, but if you've got the money, definately buy the game, it's well worth the price if you're a fan of WW2, and or aircraft.9/10.			"

												As a player of IL2 for some years now, I must say it was definitely ""Love at First Flight"".This Classic Flight Combat Sim was the game of My dreams when I fortunately stumbled onto it while browsing Steams Virtual shelves. Being a History enthusiast kinda Kat an fascinated by what it must of been like for the Brave Airmen of All Nations. Being thousands of FT/Meters up in the Blue Yonder is still kind of nerve racking on a Modern Commercial flight. Let alone with 1940's Tech and Enemy combatants trying to ruin your experience a la The Sun to Icarus. Considering the age of this Fine title it's still Very Much a Beautiful ode  to those who actually went through this interesting era in History.Detailed damage modeling from portions of your Aircraft getting blown away, sometimes affecting your Plane's controls an functions. Fuel leaks & Fires, Instrument Panels destroyed in the Cockpit.  Pilots can be Wounded in various locals of Body causing control to get progressively worse as you bleed out or Insta-Death. All Depending on where the plane was hit.Turbulence, Wind, Stalls, RedOut and BlackOut from pulling hard G's is also modeled. All wrapped in a lovingly crafted Flight Engine, that still stands well against Time. Allowing you to take to the AirWar with a Ridiculously extensive list of flyable Machines each with their own Characteristic Charms. It culminates into a package that breathes Visceral Life into those Noble Duels between Men at a time foregone; The perfect melding of Man and Machine...Air Combat of WWII. If that's what you're looking for then, IL2 1946 completes the mission....Like a Ace. Official patches dropping seldom to maintain the game and still adding Planes. Not to mention the likewise Legendary Modding Community. That is Still active in bringing Great content such as Skins, Cockpits, Planes, Gfx packs, Sound Packs, Maps, Missions & Campaigns. New Theaters to Fly even, WWI(DBW1916)& JetWar '56! Thee latter adding new munitions, Missiles & Nukes! and Even Radar on the most recent MiGs!! Infinite Thanks to all Devs and Modders for this labor of love.Sincerely,- An appreciative Fan			"

												This is a great simulator! This is a great game! I absolutely love IL-2 1946. It may be old, but man is it still awesome. There are a lot of planes to fly. There are dynamic campaigns for quite a bit of factions, you can fly Ju-87s for Romania, let that sink in.The maps are huge, the entire area of Crimea is available. There are plenty of mods out there, you'll never get bored. You may play this like a serious WW2 comabat sim, or you can just fly for fun. This is a 10/10 for sure. And for $10, it's basically a steal.			"

The damage and flight models are top notch and the variety of aircraft is great. The game really comes into its own however with mods. Dynamic campaign generators and the Ultrapack add even greater variety though can be a pain to istall.ten outta ten, get dis if you like your planes.			"

												NOTE: If you don't have a flight stick, don't purchase. If you've got a joystick/flight stick and you've got a tolerance for a high learning curve (There is adjustable difficulty based on realism and UI) then I'd would highly recommend this game. The thing that separates this from other simulator games is that the hardest part isn't the end of the journey. Examples of that include landing in just about any other flight sim or parking in Euro Truck Sim. The hardest part of this game is surviving the middle of the journey, especially if you're in a F4U Corsair fighting multiple, highly manueverable ""Zeros"". I'm not that great at this game, but I've seen people fly like ballerinas in some videos using the entire realism content that the game does provide. It's the thought that you can gain some degree of skill in this game that keeps me coming back for more and more.Even though it is rather dated looking it is quickly becoming one of my favorite purchases of 2013. If there was something for me in it, there may also be something for you.			"

												Amazing World War 2 Combat Flight Sim, a must buy for any virtural pilot. Along with this, it comes with a HUGE coummunity of modders and such. With the SAS Modact, Mods are as easy as pie to install and allows tons. In all I've got a good 15+ Mods. Do buy this! The multiplayer is accessible through Hyperlobby, a free program, and simply making an account and joining a server. With around 300 Planes, 95% or so are flyable from all sorts of countrys.  For 10 dollers, it's definatly worth it!			"

												Despite being a bit dated, IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 is still a top notch flight sim. The game had a number of substantial updates since its release, with the most recent being just last year (2013), though I'm not so certain if the game will see as much now with Battle of Stalingrad on the table. A plus in my book, some aircraft that have multiple crew stations can be manned by human players in multiplayer, so there's a possibility you can even get friends who don't care for flying to join in. If you're looking for a solid World War 2 to 1946ish era flight sim, this is a safe pick and you especially can't really go wrong with it if you get it on sale. If you're new to the flight sim scene, I would suggest trying the A6M but be careful of your dive speed. If you excede 350mph, you could cause damage to the airframe --even to where the wings tear off...Edit: I was just thinking about this review the past few days and it occurred to me that I should mention (emphasize) that this game is a flight sim and not an arcade style flyer. A flight stick is highly recommended for this game because flying with mouse and keyboard is going to give you a pretty lousy experience.			"

												Ahhh, a real classic. I just love the feeling when you are flying in a cocpit of your fokker and your patrol spots six russian pe-2:s just below, you take a deep dive and boom! You are right at their six o'clock and let those bullets fly destroying first the left engine of the pe-2 on the left and then moving to the right engine, pulling back on the stick to break out of the gunners range just to dive again chasing the next one. Another great victory for the mighty Finnish Air Force! pros:-lots of planes. I mean LOTS!-nice historical accuracy-large variety of maps on actual places-large scale battles-the game has radio comms in native languages-complete missions, not just jumping in the cocpit in the middle of the flight and shooting some rounds-campaign's for many countries (Finland ftw!)-MODS!!! get them!cons:-no real multiplayer (unless you dl hyperlobby)-flight dynamics are kind'a outdated-autopilot sometimes surprises you with it's mind blowing loss of logicoverall the game is just so much fun, most fun i've had with IL2-Sturmoviks.

If you haven't cut your teeth on more user-friendly flight sims, this one might be a bit much.A staggering array of planes to choose from including fighters, heavy bombers, and ground attack craft mean you will have plenty to do.

												Probably 10 years ago, I was heavily invested in the IL-2 franchise, with both ""Aces"" and ""Forgotten Battles"" expansions, and later the ""Pacific Fighters"" module. It just BARELY ran on my cheap, office desktop, and i had issues with the CPU overheating because of this game, but I played anyway because it was AMAZING. I had always been a fan of the WW2 flight sims from Microsoft, but this was a cut above. I really felt like I was IN the plane, not on a simulator. I had heard a lot of people saying that 1946 wouldnt work on Win 10. Recently, I heard a large number of people had success getting it to run. Since I hadn't enjoyed the game in 6-8 years, I dropped my $10 on trying it - and was blown away by how well it held up! See, I had just bought IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad a week prior, and was (still am) in love with it. However, I loved reading about all the old planes as a youngster, and to be able to fly 229 of the most famous, and the most obscure, aircraft of the era is like a dream come true. The only gripe some may have are the interior visuals - they look very dated. They are, however, immersive, and entirely 3d, so It isn't unplayable. The exterior visuals really hold up well. If you compare it to BoS or Even ""Rise of Flight"" you can tell it's a bit older, but it still looks good. The worst textures come from ground units - tanks, jeeps, AA positions, all look like theyre from the 1990's, but since you won't see them for more than a second, I really don't notice.If you're a Win 10 user, thinking about trying the more expensive BoS, maybe give this a try - I find myself playing it more than its hotter, newer sibling.:::UPDATE:::I ordered a USB Bluetooth adapter for my PC, as I play several controller-based games also. I neglected to remove my controller from both the USB charging cable, and the bluetooth device manager, and it ultimately deactivated my joystick. Once I realized the error, and removed my PS4 controller from the computer entirely, my joystick began to work again. Simply a word of caution to avid gamers.			"

The only gripe some may have are the interior visuals - they look very dated. They are, however, immersive, and entirely 3d, so It isn't unplayable. The exterior visuals really hold up well. If you compare it to BoS or Even ""Rise of Flight"" you can tell it's a bit older, but it still looks good. The worst textures come from ground units - tanks, jeeps, AA positions, all look like theyre from the 1990's, but since you won't see them for more than a second, I really don't notice.If you're a Win 10 user, thinking about trying the more expensive BoS, maybe give this a try - I find myself playing it more than its hotter, newer sibling.:::UPDATE:::I ordered a USB Bluetooth adapter for my PC, as I play several controller-based games also. I neglected to remove my controller from both the USB charging cable, and the bluetooth device manager, and it ultimately deactivated my joystick. Once I realized the error, and removed my PS4 controller from the computer entirely, my joystick began to work again. Simply a word of caution to avid gamers.			"

												No frills flight simulator. Almost no instruction whatsoever and a bare-bones interface. If you haven't cut your teeth on more user-friendly flight sims, this one might be a bit much.A staggering array of planes to choose from including fighters, heavy bombers, and ground attack craft mean you will have plenty to do. Great realism, slightly dated look.Play this if you're looking for some hardcore realism in your flight sims.			"

												Sturmovik is one of the best air combat simulators of its time, though the graphocs leave a lot to be desired when compared to games like War Thunder. If anyhting this games is honest, you pay once and get instant access to all the aircraft the game has to offer. Mods are open to anyone who has the aptitude to play around in the games directory, since Steam Workshop support is virtually non-existant. There are fun little add ons and strategy videos floating around the internet for anyone interested in learning them. The interface is clunky and a bit of an eye sore, navigation of menus is a pain whith visual reference for the various aircraft buried in layers of the interface. To really get the full experience of this game you NEED TO HAVE A CONTROLL YOKE!, there is no mouse steering like you would find in War Thunder. You are religated to keyboard controlls which are so clumsy that flying anything but a bomber is pointless, which sucks because there are no bombers for the player to fly in the base game. To get controllable bombers you need to install a mod from one of the many community websites, which is admittantly a huge pain to sort through.Excellent simulator title, unique approach to damage modeling, but dated in its application, and on its way to becoming somewhat irrelivant. There are newer version of this game which cost more, and are likely the better choice if your looking for a longer term game investment.			"

												A brief review on the, First person, War based flight simulator, game titled: IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946Gameplay:In IL-2, you have the ability to play as either the Allies or the enemies from World War II. Please note that this game is one large bundle of five separate games. Which are all bundled into the single game IL-2. This game focuses on realism the physics are amazing and lifelike. You can really feel the damage and the strain that your aircraft goes through when it is struck by a AAA. The aircraft can be completely destroyed, if it's just damaged parts of the aircraft could be missing and the aircraft won't be able to fly properly. There are wide range of aircraft, from experimental planes to bombers and fighters. Each having their own engine sound and customisable loadouts. There are preset missions in the game or you can create your own missions.Appearance:This game is roughly fifteen to twenty years old, so the resolution does not fit most monitors this makes it difficult to see other aircraft and fine detail from a long distance away. The damage models are very good for their age, and the effects like an engine burning or where an aircraft has crashed are highly detailed and look aesthetically pleasing. There are player models which you can see in the cockpit and when you're bailing out.Sounds: each aircraft has typically a unique engine sound and unique gun sounds, the sounds are affected by speed of the aircraft and your distance away from another vehicle. They sound really realistic and in some cases can be very distinct to a certain aircraft.Maps:There are many maps, the maps span from the Pacific Islands all the way to moscow the maps themselves are massive and have a large attention to detail put into them. They vary from having a large amount of forest, too miles and miles of ocean, or even mountains to hills.Customisation:You have the ability to customise what loadout you have, what map you play on, what aircraft you face, and at what altitude you do so. You can edit what the pilot wears, you can even change both the skin and marking of the aircraft that you've chosen to play as.Conclusion: IL-2 is an extraordinary game. It has a high level of detail, it's realistic it provides a challenge. From being able to choose your own occupation, to having dogfights. You're even able to experiment with the aircraft. At only ten pounds, it is a killing of a bargain. This is a critically acclaimed classic, and should not be misinterpreted as anything other. Please keep in mind you will need a joystick with a power sensor in order to play this properly as intended, other than that it is by far the best game I have in my library.			"

												I'd been flying for the better part of an hour over endless, shimmering blue waves before they came into sight. At first I thought it might be just a trick of my brain, as I had been straining my eyes toward the horizon for a long time. But no, it's not my imagination, there are the faintest shadows against the sky in the hazy blue distance. First just a few, then more, and as I fly closer they elongate and begin to take shape. A squadron of heavy bombers, at least 20 of them by looks of it, and they are on their way to drop a hundred thousand pounds of high explosives on our airbase. Well, not if I have anything to say about it.I pull back on the stick, climbing above the scatted, puffy-white stratus clouds and putting the incoming bombers a few thousand feet further below me. I let them come sliding underneath, and then I roll left and dive. The Gs push me back into my seat and I feel the blood rush from my head but I modulate my dive to avoid losing consciousness. In what feels like a matter of a few heartbeats I drop out of the clouds behind the squadron and get the tail-most bomber in my sights. The tailgunner has seen me and he opens fire, but its too late. A short burst from my cannons sets their right engine on fire. Another burst and the wing snaps like a twig in a gale, the bomber pitches sharply up and then topples over to the left. Thus begins their death spiral down into the sea below, a trail of black smoke highlighting the bomber's final path. I see a few white parachutes open along that trail of smoke but the helpless bomber crew no longer interest me. I'm getting near enough to the next bomber that their gunners start to open up, and white phosphorous tracer rounds are streaking past my cockpit glass. Cool, calm, collected... I feel the exhilaration of the kill but I ride the adrenaline smoothly. My hand rests lightly on the stick, my feet adjust the rudder ever-so-gently, and the swaying of the plane around me is like an extension of my arms and legs. The second bomber's left engine is in my sights and I squeeze the trigger....10/10 Would stalk enemy bombers again.			"

												Still the best WW2 flight sim.Especially with some of the mods that unlock numerous additional aircraft.Even unmodded this is a spectacular game.Yes it is a little dated now, but this can be largely rectified with some significant graphical improvements through the wonderful mods available.Pros:hundreds (yes hundreds) of different aircraft to flyWW2 flight sims at their bestludicrously cheap nowmassive modding community - still very activenot a detailed sim like DCSCons:vanilla game is graphically datedlack of dynamic campaign (if this is what you are looking for - which I never was)lack of well integrated multiplayer, see belownot a detailed sim like DCS Multiplayer - this game really predates the recent trend of multiplayer sim games. Hence it was not built around that as a concept. There are ways to undertake multiplayer, I believe, but I never did. I think there are better games for that such as the wonderful (and frustrating) warplanes.Overall I give this a massive recommendation, if you want a ww2 flight sim that covers many planes to a light level of detail.

												You absolutely need a joystick setup of some sort to play this game. Keyboard will not cut it, there is no mouse control.Having said that, this is short-listed for the best Combat Flight sim of all time, ever, even today. With a painstaking attention to detail and accuracy, you fly as a pawn in a much larger warmachine on missions of varying difficulty, the randomness adding to the suspense.A crazy amount of content, the ability to run on even your grandma's machine, and a community still actively maintaining the game from graphics to planes and more surely make this The Bar by which other flight sims must be judged.

												Though its a fairly old game, it is still one of the best and most versatile in the WWII dogfight business.The variety of planes, maps and modding opportunities is just amazing, not comparable to other games (even Warthunder!).The graphics are not as good as Battle of Stalingrad, but with the right mods added to your game it is nearly as beautiful.What amazes me the most is that so much players are still playing this game online! ( I recommend the SAS dogfight server on Hyperlobby, or just look it up on 1946sas. com).You won't regret this game, honestly. Cheers chaps.			"

												Still the best WW2 flight sim.Especially with some of the mods that unlock numerous additional aircraft.Even unmodded this is a spectacular game.Yes it is a little dated now, but this can be largely rectified with some significant graphical improvements through the wonderful mods available.Pros:hundreds (yes hundreds) of different aircraft to flyWW2 flight sims at their bestludicrously cheap nowmassive modding community - still very activenot a detailed sim like DCSCons:vanilla game is graphically datedlack of dynamic campaign (if this is what you are looking for - which I never was)lack of well integrated multiplayer, see belownot a detailed sim like DCS Multiplayer - this game really predates the recent trend of multiplayer sim games. Hence it was not built around that as a concept. There are ways to undertake multiplayer, I believe, but I never did. I think there are better games for that such as the wonderful (and frustrating) warplanes.Overall I give this a massive recommendation, if you want a ww2 flight sim that covers many planes to a light level of detail.

												You absolutely need a joystick setup of some sort to play this game. Keyboard will not cut it, there is no mouse control.Having said that, this is short-listed for the best Combat Flight sim of all time, ever, even today. With a painstaking attention to detail and accuracy, you fly as a pawn in a much larger warmachine on missions of varying difficulty, the randomness adding to the suspense.A crazy amount of content, the ability to run on even your grandma's machine, and a community still actively maintaining the game from graphics to planes and more surely make this The Bar by which other flight sims must be judged.

The problem occurs is because the game cannot detect a cirtain location to lauch the game, because it thinks your lauching it from the original CD-ROM version. However you downloaded it from steam. It gets confused, therefore giving you the error.			"

												This game is so good! The AI are ok and do need a update. Graphics, well i suppose they are ok, bearing in mind all of the destruction you can do with it, (Basicaly im saying that if the graphic where too good then you would just lag.) Huge selection of planes, although you cannot play all the planes, you cannot fly the B17,B24,B29 whithout mods, Quite a moddable game! The plane mods are good, although they can be abit tricky to install. Nice maps, Definetly not as good as IL-2 Cliffs Of Dover. But you would expect that. This game can run on Windows 8 not like IL-2 Cliffs Of Dover (You need extreme modding and fiddling to play IL-2 COD) Dont need a extreme gaming computer to play this game. I do have a gaming laptop and it plays fine on that (92FPS).System Specs: Prossessor: I7 Quad Core, Ram: 6GB, Graphic card: NVIDIA GEFORCE GT 630 2GB, OS: Windows 8.1			"

												A very good sim (yes, a sim! It actually tries to simulate flying a WWII fighter, unlike some other ""simulators"" *cough* warthunder *cough*). You can customize every single aspect of the difficulty until you get used to it. Seriously, it's ridiculous, you can even adjust whether or not your pilot suffers realistic bleeding when he gets shot in the arm, etc. That, coupled with the vast amount of flyable planes, mods, robust mission and campaign editor and more, make IL-2 1946 a true PC game. Of course, its graphics have aged quite a bit and you will probably need a good flight stick to get the most out of it, but all in all, the experience is amazing and it's a must have for aviation fans.10/10 BF-109 best planefu			"

It will satisfy any dogfight enthusiast, from the arcade player to the most hardcore realism junkie. The physics are very well recreated (but one can choose not to activate them for a more casual experience), and players have the options to choose how to equip there plane and wether they want limited ammo/fuel or not.Plane models are near perfect reconstitutions of real WW2 crafts, either built or imagined. The ""1946"" jets and heliplanes are a sight to see.Finally, experience missions like a real ww2 pilot : learn the map and fly on sight, as there is no minimap.I truly recommend this to anyone (it's way better than BF jets, more visceral)			"

												Finally i got one of the games that got me start liking air-combat simulations.So to beggin with the steam settings on the botton of the game page is lying said it does not work on windows 7, i bought the game no need to put it on comptability mode, wich is a good thing, but would be nice the store page was update to not cause any confusion.Now to the game, it's great, i don't know what else to say, i love this, graphics are not THE BEST, but they are acceptable and quite good to look at.Gameplay can be changed from full simulation to a little fun mode where you don't need to care about flying issues.Every single nation, and i mean EVERY SINGLE ONE, has their one lines and voice actors, can't tell if it's good since i dont understand most of the languages, but it's good to see that they ahve multiple languages in it.Your plane roster is HUGE, really HUGE, you can get pretty much every plane from bi-planes to Korean war jets, but falls short that you can't use the ace planes, only the AI wich is disapointing.There is missions, but not many people get trouble understanding then, only me it appears.One of the best things in the game is the simple mission builder, pick your plane, pick the AI planes, a map, altitude, etc. And have fun, And by pick your own plane, pick any, for example the me-262 as a russian or american, and have fun.So before we end this, all i gotta say is, that this is a game i will pick up from time to time, and just enjoy the flight experience, and since i don't have a joystick i can't get the full control-ability and the best expirience, but i still find it fun with the good ol' keyboard.Now to end it, i'd give it a 9/10, i know some people might not agree, i mean it's a great game, but it has it's down sides, but even thought it's not a 10 but it's really worth getting it, don't get me wrong, if you want a good flight simulator experience pick it up and give it a try.

												Since I'm a bit of a plane junkie, this game appealed to me greatly, so my review may be a bit biased.If you're the type who wants something similar to Ace Combat, look elsewhere. You won't be zooming about in the air doing on a dime turns in some super OP plane, just blasting people out of the sky left and right. This game requires a great deal of patience and skill to really play well, especially online against other people. The modeling of planes and all their related systems is really good, as it should be for a WW2 flight simulator. You can fly most major aircraft from all major sides in the war, ranging from the eponymous IL-2 ground attack plane, to a Japanese Zero or a P-51. That all being said, a joystick (preferrably HOTAS) is damn near a requirement to get the most out of this game. Without it you'll be stretching your fingers and your brain to remember all the controls on a keyboard. You can set the realism to lower levels so you won't have to worry about having to open radiator cowls, ammo counts, fuel status and the like, but IMO that takes away from the fun of the game.If you're a flight simulator junkie like me, and am willing to drop a few bucks on a good joystick setup, this game is definitely worth the price.

												Why don't you own this already? Easily one of the best WW2 combat sims out there. Apart from the out dated visuals this game is perfect. Plenty of planes and maps, as well as pre-made missions. Comes with a great career mode too, where you join one of the many different airforces available and serve in historically accurate missions. The fun part is that the career continues as long as your pilot is alive, meaning that all of your air kills, rewards, medals and promotions throughout the war are tracked up to the point where your pilot dies, making you actually give a damn about that little silly looking model in the cockpit :D The only downside to this is that multiplayer is a bit hard to get access to, the base game requires you to specify IP to whoever you want to connect, and there is no server browser, but you can fix that by downloading Hyper Lobby which acts as a server browser. You may also have to downgrade to 4.10.1m(I believe thats the version UP and similar packs use).			"

You can set the realism to lower levels so you won't have to worry about having to open radiator cowls, ammo counts, fuel status and the like, but IMO that takes away from the fun of the game.If you're a flight simulator junkie like me, and am willing to drop a few bucks on a good joystick setup, this game is definitely worth the price.

												If you're a flight simulationr buff looking for an excellent WWII flight sim, look no further. This is the best one you'll find. Though it looks a tad clunky at first glance, it's the most accurate WWII flight sim you'll find. It's also got a tremendous amount of content, made virtually limitless by the mission designer available therein.			"

												This is the worst stealth game I have ever played.Upon starting up the game, you are told that your name is ""John 'mad' Doe."" You are a freelance stealth operative who works around for the different countries during WW2.  It is then up to you to choose a country to work for and do what you do best, that is sabatoge of enemy bases. After choosing your country, you will be brought to a menu where you are given a briefing on your mission.  Here, you can customize John's loadout, equipment and even choose apropriate camoflauge for the mission.  You are then thrown into a giant open world map, with multiple routes to complete your objective. you are also sometimes given a set of more than capable AI teamates.  This is all very nice and well implemented, it's just to bad that they didn't focus more on the ""game"" part of this ""game""The amount of controls for this game are absolutely ludicrous.  You will probably end up having to rebind and memorize over 100 different keystrokes just to make the game playable.  After that, you will of course try and move to your objective. However, the developers of this game didn't understand the concept of a ""stealth"" game.  Any time you try and move john around, you might as well be playing the sound of a b-52 bomber over a boombox at full volume.  It is not remotely possible to sneak around in this game.  On top of this, if you try to turn John around to fast or make to sudden a move, he will fall over to the ground faster than a boombox playing the sounds of a b-52 at full volume being hurled out the back of a b-52.You might be thinking now ""Well if I can't get close to the enemy, I'll just take them out from far away.""  That's just the problem.  Every weapon in the game has no silencer. You might as well be firing rockets, dropping bombs or shooting a .50 cal machine gun at them.  Finally, there is also no way to see how visible you are to enemies.  Since the maps or so open, you can literally be seen by an enemy miles away.Overall this is a poor excuse for a stealth game.  Stay away from it, and instead look at better stealth games like the original thief.			"

												GET A JOYSTICK. This is by far the best WWII sim game I've ever played! The graphics are pretty dated but the gameplay and physics definetly still hold up. The game is unplayable without a joystick though, so It'd be a good idea to get one. If you can get your hands on a joystick that will handle Pitch, roll, Yaw, and throttle, that's optimal. If you can only get a stick that does Pitch, roll, and throttle, like the logitech Attack 3, you can do what i do and plug in another usb controller (ps4 controller, wired 360 controller, anything with a stick) and map the rudder to one of the sticks on that. It's not the best solution but having rudder control adds so much to the game.I recommend this game to any WWII enthusiast, or even anyone who's ever wanted to learn to fly. The game implements many real flying issues like Stalls, Spins, torque, and engine heat!  Of course, if you want a more arcade-like experience, you can turn these features off and have a ""point-and-go"" flight experience as  well.			"

												This game is amazing. Seriously, for the little money you have to pay for it, there is tonnes of stuff to do. Everything from a campaign, a huge mission builder, a small one where you can just set up a few planes, get in one yourself and go ahead and shoot them down for the fun of it, and more. The damge is tonnes and tonnes of fun to play with (for me at least) each individual piece of the place can be ripped or shot off. The bullet holes are a bit off but come on, this is 2006, and with the amount of content this game gives, it can be easily overlooked. Hell, you can shoot pieces of your OWN plane off when you're playing as a backkseat gunner or wherever the gunner is positioned.To sum up, I'd give this game a 9.5 out of 10. It is so much fun.Go f*cking buy it.			"

												Hello everyone. I want to share with you my impression of Il2 1946 !The game is still the same like 10 years earlier. The mechanics work great and feel realy realistic if you keep the right config. The game does also make a lot of fun if you play with your own rules and does never get boring. I have to admit that  I tried to play with Joystick and also just with my keyboard. I noticed that the experience you get while playing with a Joystick is much better because the aircrafts are better to fly and coordinate especially if you want to kill someone.It is still possible to fly via only keyboard but i would not recoomend this at all. Less fun and feels less good.All in all the Game is worth it just for nostalgia reasons alone but also for its cheap prize. 10 Euro isnt that much at all and for 2 Games its perfectly fine. Considering its works on every Windows like mine (Windows 10) I highly recommend you to buy this game.I`ll hope I could help you with your decission.Your german pall Ashoka Tano			"

												Recommendation with a big asterisk.Il-2 isn't for everyone. It's not really a game but rather a WWII combat flight simulator with incredible depth and a large selection of available planes that come with great mechanical detail. Before you purchase or play this game you need to be prepared for that. Furthermore you have to prepared for the fact that there is no easy way in. You will need to spend several hours before you can even hit an enemy once. If you don't have a big interest in WWII warbirds from both sides there's nothing to keep you intrigued other than the gameplay which is incredibly customizable and deep though.Enter the big asterisk. Everything you get from the game is what you bring into it. There's no storyline, no interesting campaign, just no character to any of it, nothing to welcome you into the world of historical air combat. The ""training"" is laughable and the included missions are plain boring and uninspired. Unless you want to delve deep into the mission editor you're lost, the quick mission builder is less than stellar. The community is not very helpful either when it comes to modding the 15 year old engine so with every aspect of Il-2 you're basically left to your own devices. With a little effort from the developers this could have been a wonderful experience for a wider audience. Much older games like the Red Baron series have shown what an immersive campaign mode can add to a simulator. I can still recommend Il-2 though based on its mechanical strength and commendable wealth of content. Ever since my earliest childhood I've been a hardcore airplane nerd and just being able to fly my fantasy league of planes into combat with my entire keyboard scattered with shortcuts is enough to recommend this simulator to like-minded inviduals with too much time on their hands. Everyone else will be left standing in the rain. You will need patience, dedication and a good joystick and even then it's no guarantee you will like it. I can't blame anyone who never got into Il-2, personally I fell asleep playing similarly deep and realistic games like the Arma series.For those who are complaining this game is unplayable without a joystick: no sh*t, this is not war thunder.

												If you are into simulators, especially WWII flight simulators, this is a game for you. Ideally, you'd also want to use a joystick, as the control scheme is much more fluid and easy to use with a stick compared to the keyboard.Once you start the game you can choose between doing the story missions or trying out pilot school, which is intended to prepare you for the more intense story missions. There are also video tutorials available to watch, which are extremely useful and strongly recommended. The videos will teach you everything from taking off, to landing, to dropping bombs on your enemies and dogfighting.At the start, I had A LOT of trouble getting my plan to even successfully lift off the ground. Be patient, as you will probably see many ""engine inoperable"" notifications (if you haven't already blown up or overheated your engine by this point). The control scheme is a little spread out, but it shouldn't be too difficult to familiarize yourself with the layout. The learning curve for the game is not too steep, but it can be difficult in the beginning. Give yourself plenty of time to get used to taking off, and everything else will be easy to pick up after that.The graphics are a little dated, but when you get into a skirmish or large-scale battle, you will love the intensity of the fighting. Definitely recommend for the (war) flight simulator junkies.			"

												I opened the game. I started a bombing sight tutorial, didn't listen and went strait into the game as a Ju87 Stuka against some Russian bomb targets. Going in, I didn't really know the controls, but I let the autopilot spend the 2 minutes it took to get to the targets. After a short 30 seconds, the other stukas had already dropped their payloads, I didn't know how to but I was told the mission was complete. I was still flying however.We were then suddenly surprised to see a small fighter group of Ishaks close in on us from the ground. I thought this would be a good opportunity to learn a bit about the dogfighting. So, I dive in the mighty Stuka, hoping to boom and zoom a lowly Ishak.After about 15 seconds, I got one on screen. I fought for a good while with my plane to stay on target, line the sights up, get in range, stay far enough away for the bullets to hit him, and also fight the speed of the Stuka in a dive. I then lined the Isak up and...Fired. Miss. Again. Miss. AGAIN! Direct hit. I heard the machine guns roar as bits of the Ishak's wing went flying by when I suddenly got about 500 messages from other pilots;""Two is hit!""  ""I down!""  ""Need assistance...""And then I was shot and my fuel tank exploded, shutting off my engine. I tried desperately to force the damned Stuka to the mainland and crash ""safely"", but to no avail. I bailed out at 300 metres and was shot by an enemy pilot. Real damn honorable.10/10 would fail again.			"

												The best $10 you can possibly spend on Steam. This game is incredible. You won't find many other games that can match the challenge that IL-2 presents. The tactical depth is infinite and the difficulty is high but the satisfaction of improving your skills is immense. This is a hardcore flight simulator, so don't expect a shallow learning curve. Speed, accuracy and finesse with the controls are a must. Situational awareness is equally critical, as are reflexes, decisionmaking and tactical analysis, teamwork and communication, etc. The demands are high, but the reward is great. Of course you also have to fly your plane; proper engine management is very important, as is a basic understanding of aerodynamics and flight physics.. However, while the game DOES expect alot from you, it does also strike a near-perfect balance by introducing the challenge of a flight simulator while avoiding overly-complicated modern avionics and difficult-to-learn computer systems. cont'd..

												This is the worst stealth game I have ever played.Upon starting up the game, you are told that your name is ""John 'mad' Doe."" You are a freelance stealth operative who works around for the different countries during WW2.  It is then up to you to choose a country to work for and do what you do best, that is sabatoge of enemy bases. After choosing your country, you will be brought to a menu where you are given a briefing on your mission.  Here, you can customize John's loadout, equipment and even choose apropriate camoflauge for the mission.  You are then thrown into a giant open world map, with multiple routes to complete your objective. you are also sometimes given a set of more than capable AI teamates.  This is all very nice and well implemented, it's just to bad that they didn't focus more on the ""game"" part of this ""game""The amount of controls for this game are absolutely ludicrous.  You will probably end up having to rebind and memorize over 100 different keystrokes just to make the game playable.  After that, you will of course try and move to your objective. However, the developers of this game didn't understand the concept of a ""stealth"" game.  Any time you try and move john around, you might as well be playing the sound of a b-52 bomber over a boombox at full volume.  It is not remotely possible to sneak around in this game.  On top of this, if you try to turn John around to fast or make to sudden a move, he will fall over to the ground faster than a boombox playing the sounds of a b-52 at full volume being hurled out the back of a b-52.You might be thinking now ""Well if I can't get close to the enemy, I'll just take them out from far away.""  That's just the problem.  Every weapon in the game has no silencer. You might as well be firing rockets, dropping bombs or shooting a .50 cal machine gun at them.  Finally, there is no way to see how visible you are to enemies.  Since the maps or so open, you can literally be seen by an enemy miles away.Overall this is a poor excuse for a stealth game.  Stay away from it, and instead look at better stealth games like the original thief.			"

												Mother and father get little tired from building Communism, so they want to go to Moscow to buy vodka. They call most trusted babysitter. When babysitter arrives, children already sleep in beds. Babysitter just sits around and make sure everything good with children. Later that night, babysitter gets bored and goes to read Marx, but she cant read downstairs because there's no electricity (parents didnt want children reading Marx all night long). So, she calls parents and asks if she can get candles to read Marx in their room. Of course, the parents say it okay, but babysitter has one final request. She ask if she could cover up Lenin statue outside bedroom window with blanket or cloth, because it make her nervous. Phone line is silent for moment, and father who say, ""Take children and get out of house. We will call militia. We do not have Lenin statue."" Militia find all three of house occupants dead because KGB kill them for try to cover Lenin statue. Then militia arrest parents for not having Lenin statue. Such is life in Moscow.			"

												I realise this will probably be downvoted into oblvion because of the rabid fanbase but it deserved an honest review. WARNING!!! Do not buy unless you have a super crazy joystick, irtracker, mad software for controller mapping to keboard functions, and many many hours to throw away due to massive bugs + time to deal with a learning curve thats like running into the bottom of a cliff (think those rock climbing walls where they are actually angled backwards). I'm sure there is a very niche group of pepole that enjoy this level of masochism but frankly im just not seeing it. Now dont get me wrong i love flight games but this is a billion steps too far. Quite Frankly I LOVE the ace combat series and I have beaten ACE Combat: Assault Horizon on its HARDEST difficulty (on console) but this is an effort in futility. If you expect to be able to get off the ground when you start playing this you are gonna have a BAD TIME!!!! Thiis is a game that is HIGHLY over rated by its reviews and I will be requesting a refund so that I can get the Enhanced Edition of Assault Horizon a game which is extemely UNDERRATED by its reviews. I should add that the AI in this is severly broken enemys and allys both cheat like mad and none of the AI observe the realistic physics and often cannot land/take off themselves without crashing or running into a control tower.  If your looking for fun realistic combat WarThunder is a much better option.			"

												NOTE: Joysticks are heavily recommended, especially for multiplayer versus I guess, but for Singleplayer a keyboard is passable. Barely. It's just not as accurate as a method of steering for a game like this where planes don't actually just fly straight.Pretty good sim-game. Haven't played the actual campaigns, but mechanics-wise it's pretty deep and features various planes from the major nations including the USSR, Germany, UK, USA, Japan, even Hungarian and some Italian planes. Probably more nations than just that but I don't know all the planes. "

												I bought this game as some kind of gold edition in 2009 on sale, and didn't get around to installing/playing until 2014. It seems like a very realistic flight simulator where they expect you to have/spend on a good joystick and head tracker. Graphics are dated and, as a realistic flight simulator, difficulty is pretty high. Personally if I were to buy a flight sim game in 2014 I would go with something newer, if I wanted something less demanding I would go back to War Thunder. "

												IL-2 Stumovik 1946 8/10 - Graphics are not as pretty as newer games that is why i don't give it a 10/10The best flight sim I have ever played.  It is a shame that BoS and CloD failed to deliver.  All they had to do was take the original game and make the graphics pretty.  The details and amount of content in IL-2 Sturmovik 1946 is far superior.  The community is small but strong.  The problem is that there are so many mods for the game that the community is split up.   I was so hoping that these new titles would unite the community under one patch and allow these games to thrive.  Unfortuanetly they were unable to deliver so i find my self playing a 11 year old game that is better then anything out there.We can't really blame the devs for everything the die hard community is very demanding.  I think 1946 hit a perfect balance of engine managment that neither of these new games do well.  None of the settings for the engine managenemt in 1946 would cause you to blow the engine unless you ran it full  throttle and let if over heat or played with the prop pitch and over spun the engine.... there was engine managment but very little of it was engine breakering unless you were really pushing the limits. CloD i can't take off without blowing a gasket or perforating a radiator and I don't know why which just makes it so frustrating that I have no interest in learning, so only the die hards will play this game so the community will be small which will make the Devs little money and low motive to update or release patches.  This can already be seen as the community of die hards has taken this over releasing their own patches for the game.Bottom Line is I am just disapointed and will have to wait many more years for a decent flight sim to come out and actaully push my graphics card and wow my senses.  (It will probably be BoS or CloD once the community patches the crap out of them, currently leaning towards BoS as per reasons above)			"

												Used to play a great flight sim game on the xbox 360 called: Birds  of Steel with an Ace Edge Flight Stick & although this game is older graphics wise, this game has alot more realistic physics & aircraft available to use (well over 200+) than Birds of Steel did (106)  You can do alot more in the operations & controls of the various aircraft like being able to open & close the canopy for example. I also like being able to use a flight stick & pedals for this & other flight sim games on PC.

												This actually looks like a pretty respectable flight simulator with lots of details in the cockpit controls you can use, but be warned that it basically requires a joystick, if not rudder pedals as well. The default keymapping for the controls are horrible. If you do have a joystick and something to use for rudder control, and you remap the keys to something more sensible, you'll probably like this one if you're a flight sim buff.			"

												Terrible game. Initially when I bought this game, I knew that it was a simulator of sorts and should expect complicated controls, but what I got was much worse. Not only are the controls complicated, but there is no indication anywhere of which button does what. Graphics aren't great, but it was released in 2005, so what can you expect? Even after I somewhat figured out the controls, I couldn't get my plane off the ground at all. Not worth the $10 at all.			"

												Great flight sim.  It is perfectly realistic, and personally helped me learn how to fly a plane in real life.  However, the glitches are endless.  Your comrades will fly faster than you if you are not in autopilot, and the enemies have no physics or engine problems.  I could go on and on.  So lets just say this, It is a great flight sim, if you can get past the glitches and the fact that you need a joystick to play it correctly.  7/10 TOO MANY GLITCHES!			"

AWFUL experience with an AWFUL jumped up official community - MOVE ALONG - nothing to see here but frustration and abuse!!

												I am going to say I do not recommend this game, except to those who are experienced flight sim Gamers.  Without a proper joystick and knowledge of how planes work and what the various terms mean, you will really struggle to even take off let along particiapte in comabat.  In other words, this is Sim, not arcade.  So buyer beware.			"

												A terribly unpolished, buggy game.  Very inconsistent.  Hard core simmers may find excitement in the tiny details, but even they have plenty of hair-pulling sessions.  Not worthless, but not worth the $10 its currently goes for.			"

												More for a flying enthusiest than a gamer...  Impossible to play with out a joystick.  No way of knowing where you are on the map or even a map to look at when you are in flight.  Looking for a fun flying game and I regret spending the $10 on this one.			"

												Holy cwap, this was the hardest game to start with! There is a whole training section, but it does not let you do anything. It's just videos of a guy doing various maneuvers and the text on screen is loosely explaning what is going on. The mission creator is greweling and confusing. The default graphics look very bad even considering the year when the game came out because they hardly changed the engine since the original Il-2 from 2001. There are millions of mods to help that problem and to improve the gameplay in general, but they are near impossible to understand and get working, in many cases incompatible with the latest version of the game. There is a club, and if you are a new player, you ain't in it. The controls are somewhere between scarely realistic and broken - I have not yet figured out which.The difficulty curve is way higher than in Flight Simulator X and is too steep for me. I will give it another try or two but I think I will wait for a more user friendly sequel. So far the problem has been that the sequels kind of sucked. Perhaps War Thunder will one day become a user friendly yet accurate sim, though it is not this day.This is a game for you if you are ready to put real concentration, time and effort into it. I have played car sims, flight sims, submarine sims, truck sims, etc...Nothing has been as confusing and difficult as this game.			"

												I f you like historical flight simulators, this is the only one to get.  Plenty of aircraft to fly, which starts from the first monoplanes and goes to the dawn of jet figters, so you never run out of birds to fly.  A great career mode, and unrivaled realism.  You can make the plane as hard or as easy to fly if you want, customize skins, and create your own maps in the in-game map editor.  Graphics are a bit dated, but this does not distract from the hours of fun you can have.  To participate in multiplayer, however, you must know the IP of your host server.  THis can prove a biit frustrating at first, but it is easier with time.			"

And the best part is, it can be as realistic or arcadey as you'd like, meaning all flight fans can enjoy it even if you don't want to worry about realistic gunnery (Which I wouldn't recommend using at first) or worrying about blowing your engine up.But if you DO crank the realism up... well it can be quite challenging, but also a blast, especially when you manage to hit a BF-109 mid turn juuust right and send it smoking into the ground below. (And for added effect, if the guy survived your attack and jumped... you can always shoot his parachute...)			"

												What did we get here from the old box of games? IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 it is!IL-2 Sturmovik: 1946 is a classic WWII plane simulator with many planes to fly. If you'd ever like a classic dogfight with a friend, this game is good. It is also a good game for stuff like LAN-parties as it can host servers on LAN-only.This game might be really old, but it is just an absolute gem. It works on new computers (tested on Windows 10 and a gaming PC bought in the beginning of 2015, works perfectly fine in Full HD resolution). The game can literally work on any calculator you own as it is like 10 years old.Don't let that fool you though, this is quite a good plane simulator. To start up your plane, you need to do a lot of stuff before going into the skies. Physics can be as realistic as you want them to be. Unrealistic physics are the most fun, since can bounce into the sea and still fly, but realism mode changes all that except graphics-wise.Conclusion:+ Both realistic and unrealistic can be amazing in their own ways+ Runs basically on any computer that uses Steam+ Compatible with new screens+ Hilarious glitches+ Great choice of WWII planes and even prototypes+ Great for LAN-parties- Quite an old game- Graphics are not the best in the world- Unrealistic mode glitches are fun, but sometimes not fun for your opponents- Render problems at some points (just check my oil lake pictures, that is meant to be a river and a lake)I CAN recommend this game to anyone who likes their plane simulators, but not everybody will like this ancient gem. I'll leave it up to you, as I DO have more positive points than negative ones, but the negative ones are more significant.			"

												You'll definitely need at least an analog gamepad to play this game, and every pilot will recommend that you invest in an inexpensive joystick like the Logitech X3D.Don't jump straight into the campaign - this is a fairly realistic flight sim. Best way to start this game is to fly single missions in an easy to fly plane (I recommend the La-5FN) until you're comfortable with:1. Taking off and landing2. Performing aerobatics3. One-on-one air combat (Basic Fighter Maneuvers). To learn this, I highly recommend the Falcon 3 BFM tutorial - look up ""Art of the Kill Falcon 3"" on Youtube. Ultimately, though, remember that you're basically learning to fly combat aircraft, so be prepared to give the game some time. It'll take a while to get comfortable, and you'll be pulling G's with sim (and real life!) pilots with 1000s of hours of flight time under their belts, but as stated in other reviews, it's a very enjoyable game once you finally straighen up and fly right.

												I used to play this game soo much when i got it again last night i had soo much fun living old memories the best part is using th bombers and sitting on the turret and shooting down planes because its fun and sure the graphics are out dated but doesnt mean it isnt fun on replaying missons i say hell yea though there is like 80 maps but there is sooo many ways to complete each one with different planes from bombers to pre ww2 jets or later ww2 planes the ai are smart if you play on harder difficulties the only problem is when you fly with a pack of bombers out of 10 times 4 of the ten will crash into eachother if your in a group but other than that its amazing the best few dollars i spent on an old game			"

												This is a great flight combat simulator, maybe the best out there. The graphics are kind of outdated because its not a new game, but still good and rounded, the airplanes are very nice modelled, landscape are simple but cool, effects are not bad.  Panels and Hud are not special but you have lot of views to choose from.The strong point of this game is when it comes to simulate the typical features of this kind of combat and this aviation era. You can see realistic aerodynamics, ballistic trajectory,  angle of attack stalls, overheat, spins ( you need to know how to proper get out or it will spin until hit the ground ), torque effect, potential energy, and much more.  The hitboxes and damage effect also works great.  You have a enormous variety of planes and targets to choose from, and every plane have their own characteristics.  There many other cool features.The only downside for me is the campaign, because it´s take so many time and are not something that catch you and get you evolved, i just don´t feel like it is a campaign.   But i had a lot of fun doing custom missions, and multiplayer can be real exciting and challenging.IL2 have a lot of option to setup the game more easy and friendly, but in cost of the realism of course, i´d rather play it ""as real as it gets"".You will NEED a joystick to play, as any flightsim, but this in special, without a good stick this game can be really disappointing.The controls and commands are very simple, no secret..   If you like WW2 aviation era, and want a realistic simulator that you need to spend a lot of time to learn until you get proficient, this is the way to go.If you just want to do crazy stunts and frag some enemies right of the box then forget it.

I've looked online and seen a few posts from people with similar problems, but nothing has worked for me yet. I can't recommend the game as it is since it simply doesn't work, but I'll happily update my review once this bug gets fixed.			"

												31 march 15 update: THIS GAME IS UP AND WORKING AGAIN:  With a tweak...once you've installed it, right click on the game name, scroll down to properties, then choose BETAS. Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It'll start!An oldie but a goodie!IL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It's detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it's an awesome game. Given it's pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky. There's a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import. These days there's plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.Damage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.I'd recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I'd suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you'll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I've played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I'm still  more nervous about landing than combat!There's also some ""what if?"" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They're fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don't add to the realism. There's some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.This is not for the casual gamer. I can't stress this enough. This game demands your attention and your commitment. do so and it'll reward you. A number of real-life veterans have said this game captures the difficulty of ww2 air combat. Don't expect an easy ride.			"

You can play the game with muse and keyboard however it is much eisier if you use a joystick as well. Overall this game is very good.

												The game alone is about as close as you can come to an authentic world war two flight experience on any system (sorry games like Wings of Prey). The realism is there, plenty of flyable aircraft, plenty of awesome chaos and realism. Then, if you add in the free UltraPack mod, it really takes off-adding hundreds of new aircraft types well into the jet age (and ALL of them flyable), expanding mission options, and all kinds of good stuff to make this the war flight sim of your dreams. What if the Navy had the FJ-2 and sidewinder missiles at Pearl Harbor? You can find out! IL-2 1946 with the Ulrapack mod definitely provides for endless possibilities and endless hours of fun.			"

												I can partially recommend this ""game"". It's an excellent simulator with a wide variety of aircraft and mission types, including carrier-based operations, and the price is great. It's difficult and you'll need to put in quite a few hours of practice before you can make successful bombing runs and shoot down other fighters, but it's fair.However, there's really not much of a game here, there's essentially no story, and there's a lot of time spent doing rather tedious things. For example, I was playing a bomber campaign and so many missions went like this: 1) take off from the carrier and get in formation (a few minutes of fun), 2) fly in a straight line for 20 minutes (boring), 3) set up a bombing run and drop bombs (2-3 minutes of great excitement), 4) spend 20 minutes flying back (boring), 5) land on the carrier (a few minutes of fun). There's time compression, but it can't be safely set very high. Sometimes the mission generator mixes it up, but the vast majority of my time was spent uneventfully flying to and from the mission areas. I'm sure it's realistic, but it's not exciting or fun.In summary, it's a great simulator that lets you do all kinds of military flying and the huge number of (mostly randomized) campaigns gives tremendous replay value, but after you get the hang of it most of your time will be spent feeling bored unless you actually enjoy flying in a straight line in formation for 30-60 minutes per mission.I've heard that the multiplayer is decent but I don't believe there's any matchmaking so you'll have to find a community if you want to try it.

												This is a flight simulation game. It have many airplanes to choose from, each with their unique way to pilot... A 3 axis flight stick or a full-blown cockpit controller is a must to play. The reason why I don't play it... But, man, I'm soooooo tempted to buy one :) ...			"

Cant do flatspins in war thunder and you wanna do some get this. 2.honestly why would you waste time trying to unlock the MIG-9 when you can get this and fly it FOR FREE!!! 3. This has so many planes and first person for bombers. And thats why i recommend IL-2 Sturmovik:1946			"

												31 march 15 update: THIS GAME IS UP AND WORKING AGAIN:  With a tweak...once you've installed it, right click on the game name, scroll down to properties, then choose BETAS. Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It'll start!An oldie but a goodie!IL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It's detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it's an awesome game. Given it's pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky. There's a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import. These days there's plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.Damage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.I'd recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I'd suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you'll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I've played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I'm still  more nervous about landing than combat!There's also some ""what if?"" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They're fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don't add to the realism. There's some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.This is not for the casual gamer. I can't stress this enough. This game demands your attention and your commitment. do so and it'll reward you. A number of real-life veterans have said this game captures the difficulty of ww2 air combat. Don't expect an easy ride.			"

												My hours are a bit wrong on this one, as i have previously owned the Disk version of il-2 Sturmovik: Forgotten battles and Pacific Fighters when they first came out. My god is this game great. Whether its making your own Career as a fighter over Stalingrad, or making your own Insane missions in the great mission builder, this game is the best Combat Flight sim i have ever played.Dynamic campaigns mean you'll never quite have the same mission twice (Although alot of the times you'll be doing the same thing depending on your aircrafts role, but in different locations against different amounts and types of enemys) while still getting in Historic battles such as Stalingrad, Berlin, or Midway (And everything between). If thats not your thing or you feel its too repeatative, then check out the mission editors.Quick Mission Builder is an easy and fast way of making anything from Bombing missions to straight up massive dogfights. You simply just choose what aircraft you want to fly and how many squadmates and your Allies and Enemys, Pick the loadouts, skins, and countries. (You can fly an American plane as a German if you want) Then get into the action and deal with whatever you threw at yourself.Full mission builder is a bit different.....and i mean alot different. You control every aspect of basically anything. Control weather, time, Cloud height and make buildings and objects. You want a plane to take off, fly to somewhere along a specific route and altitude? Done. You want to patrol something? Done. Do you want Tanks and AA guns on the ground supporting or making your own Ground offensive? Done! You can even position Static cameras for those moments you just want to sit back and watch the carnage. Blow up and damage cities with a simple slider and clicks. Hell you can make planes Kamikaze things if you do it right. One of my personal favorites is to make roughly 50 aircraft, Fighers, Bombers, whatever, and fly them straight it to a massive area filled with AA guns and just try to survive for as long as you can while watching♥♥♥♥♥♥get blown up.All and all i would give it a 10 out of 10. The only big downside i see is that there is alot of planes you cant fly, (there is still a good number of flyable ones though ;3 ) but i know there is mods out there that will litterally make everything flyable and even add more. ♥♥♥♥ you can get Atomic bomb mods if you want. The modding comunity is amazing.Anywho thats enough of my rant. My god have i typed alot. 10/10 and Thank you if you took the time to read my rambling.			"

												Hellooo. I used to have IL-2 Forgotten Battles, but I decided to replace it with this. I have only played a little bit, but I think it is enough to write this review. Buying the thing was pretty simple but I had problems starting the game up. It was extremely frustrating but I submitted my problem to Steam Support, got an answer instantly,  followed the instructions that they gave me and it worked perfectly. IL-2 is of course getting old, but it has it's advantages. It plays very smoothly on my computer (A windows 7 that is kinda clogged with stuff that has built up over the years) and you get more options than newer sims. I thought this would be a good purchase instead of a newer one, since I get so many aircraft. IL-2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad (recently released) is a great, high-end sim, but you can only fight with Russian and German planes and during the same time of year and the same location. This was a better option for me because I can fly what I feel like flying. Just today I reanacted Pearl Harbor, then I flew a 1944 USAAF mission over Europe. Also the game has language of course, and some noseart is a little, well, you know. But this can be fixed. You can switch off subtitles, and for languages that you can understand you can simply delete the ""bad word"" files. And nose art files you dont approve of can be deleted also. If my instructions arent very clear, I'm sure you can look up how to do it. Anyways, the aircraft selection is wonderful, you can fly aircraft from all the major powers, (some smaller countries too). You can fly alot of stuff from 1930s biplanes, P-51s, all the way up to late WW2 jets, including some wacky German experimental aircraft. Also, a very neat feature is that you can take a picture of your face and use it to make your own pilot! You can zoom in on your plane and it's you in the cockpit! I love it. You can create your own nose art and slogans too, along with entire paint jobs. But I dont know a whole lot about that besides adding art and text to the plane. So yeah, overall I would recommend it, it works for me. ""You stay classy"". *clicks tongue, puts on goggles, and flies away* Merry Christmas by the way. Hopefully you'll be getting something from steam. I'm probably going to get T-72 Balkans on Fire next.			"

												I put in a lot of hours into this game in my younger years. I found this game is quite a big step of from Microsoft's Combat Flight Sim series. The developers really put their lives into making this game great while creating it. The variety and accuracy of the fighters is truly impressive. The aircraft sounds can be a little repetitive, however the game has quite a bit modding capability.The quick scenario creator allows you to quickly create a mission in a logical and quick manner as opposed to Cliffs of Dover. Despite the older graphics engine, this game is a must have for any combat flight sim lover.			"

												I have over 500 hours on the pc dvd version that I ordered off of Amazon quite a few years ago. Pretty much the same game with a few improved astetics. This is a very good sim that just about has everything you can hope. I played the disk version on an  hp laptop (2007-2008 model with vista lol)  so I can't imagine there being very many rigs that cant run this adequately. I personally like the fighter escorts and instant action type scenarios. The dynamic campaigns are amazing but I've always struggled with the bomber campaigns. If you are a fan of combat flight sims or flight sims in general, then this is definite must have. If you can find it cheaper on amazon or another site then get it. Both versions are essentially  the same.			"

												My first impressions after about a day:I decided to start a hungarian campaign in this game, and to my surprise found it to be extremely in depth and of high quality. The voices of the AI pilots are amazing, even in hungarian. You can tell a lot of effort has been put into the game and its story mode. I was absolutely amazed by the detail of the campaign map. I cannot speak much for the aircraft flight models (from a realistic point of view), as I have no idea how these planes perform in real life, but I have never been frustrated while flying. Every crash has been my fault. The interior cockpits of all the planes are at least decent, with most of them being very impressive. All in all I would like to suggest this game for any aircraft enthusiast. This game still holds up nicely today, and I hope simulator designers will use this game as a base for many features of the games that they are working on.			"

												Can't beat the price, buy with a joystick for maximum fun(logitech extreme 3d pro can be had for around 35 dollars) even better with mods. Check out SAS il2 mods, the modding community is well established and fairly easy to install.			"

												This is a flight simulation game. It have many airplanes to choose from, each with their unique way to pilot... A 3 axis flight stick or a full-blown cockpit controller is a must to play. The reason why I don't play it... But, man, I'm soooooo tempted to buy one :) ...			"

												I can partially recommend this ""game"". It's an excellent simulator with a wide variety of aircraft and mission types, including carrier-based operations, and the price is great. It's difficult and you'll need to put in quite a few hours of practice before you can make successful bombing runs and shoot down other fighters, but it's fair.However, there's really not much of a game here, there's essentially no story, and there's a lot of time spent doing rather tedious things. For example, I was playing a bomber campaign and so many missions went like this: 1) take off from the carrier and get in formation (a few minutes of fun), 2) fly in a straight line for 20 minutes (boring), 3) set up a bombing run and drop bombs (2-3 minutes of great excitement), 4) spend 20 minutes flying back (boring), 5) land on the carrier (a few minutes of fun). There's time compression, but it can't be safely set very high. Sometimes the mission generator mixes it up, but the vast majority of my time was spent uneventfully flying to and from the mission areas. I'm sure it's realistic, but it's not exciting or fun.In summary, it's a great simulator that lets you do all kinds of military flying and the huge number of (mostly randomized) campaigns gives tremendous replay value, but after you get the hang of it most of your time will be spent feeling bored unless you actually enjoy flying in a straight line in formation for 30-60 minutes per mission.I've heard that the multiplayer is decent but I don't believe there's any matchmaking so you'll have to find a community if you want to try it.

												31 march 15 update: THIS GAME IS UP AND WORKING AGAIN:  With a tweak...once you've installed it, right click on the game name, scroll down to properties, then choose BETAS. Then select old_version, ignore the code box, then apply. It'll start!An oldie but a goodie!IL-2 Sturmovik has developed from an Eastern Front ww2 flght sim into an absolute monster! It's detailed, unforgiving at times, takes effort to get into, and has a steep learning curve. Despite, or because of all of that, it's an awesome game. Given it's pretty old now, most mid range systems will do well with this. The graphics were good for its time, and still hold up ok in the sky. There's a huge online community of verteran players making all sorts of custom missions and skins for this game. Skins are easy to import. These days there's plenty of action for the other fronts of WW2 as well, especially in the Pacific.Damage is well modelled, flight characteristics have been well researched, with only a few glitches, and aircraft interiors are beautifully done. Oleg , the man who started all this, was insistent that no aircraft be imported until the cockpit was fully accurate.I'd recommend this for someone who has an interest in flight from this era, and is willing to put in the hours to learn to fly adequately. I'd suggest starting not in your favorite aircraft, but something more forgiving like an IL-2 to learn to fly. Eventually you'll be able to handle other aircraft no problem. Landing is a big challenge, I've played over 2000 hours on this game back in its CD only days and I'm still  more nervous about landing than combat!There's also some ""what if?"" aircraft included, hence the title 1946. They're fun, and make for an interesting experience, but don't add to the realism. There's some fascinating player made 1946 missions out there well worth playing.This is not for the casual gamer. I can't stress this enough. This game demands your attention and your commitment. do so and it'll reward you. A number of real-life veterans have said this game captures the difficulty of ww2 air combat. Don't expect an easy ride.			"

												Many years ago I discovered this game, Its only now I've bought the complete collection. One of the few simulators that maintains both the realism and immersion of flight as well as the intensity of air based combat. This game can be somewhat beginner unfriendly at times. With no in game tutorial your left on your own to learn the basics of flight, dogfighting and bombing. IL2 is a simulator, so you will spend much time flying to your objectives, and monitoring your flight indicators and fine tuning control surfaces. With hundreds of accurately detailed and performing aircraft, as well as a wide selection of war theatre and maps IL-2 sturmovik is a must have for any flight sim or dogfight enthusiast. I find this game to be a perfect blend of fun and realisim. I'm not going to say it easy, however even with its age IL2 1946 remains an unsung milestone in the flight genre of videogames.			"

												When first looking at it you probably thought ""Ew thoe graphics."" That is the one ""con"" in this game filled with pros. There are a few bugs here and there but there is in any game. The amount of missions and planes is astounding, the developers put so much work into it. It is very realistic with lots of controls I can barely remember most of the time. The missions offer a wide variety of gameplay from escorting bombers high over Japan to intercepting bombers in rocket planes to dive bombing aircraft carriers. It also adds its own story line in 1946 with the war still waging where one of the fist missions, spoiler incoming, is to kill Himmler.I would totally recommend this game to anyone who is interested in planes or second world war history. It can also run on a toaster, you really don't need a powerful computer. I have played the first two games for probably well over 100 hours each and this game kept me interersted with all the new planes you can fly.			"

												This game is a cornerstone of modern flight sims. Even though the game is based on the 2001 original, it's still a very potent platform and is still getting patched ten years later. I wholly recommend this classic, this bastion of glory to anyone. The AI is superb even though the multiplayer scene is slowly depleting. The game comes at version 4.09, the most recent patches can be found at Mission for Today.			"

Has a learning curve but is easy to get through with past flight sim experience. Joystick is a must for this game and track IR would be even better. It has many different classes of aircraft, bombers, fighters, carrier based planes and jets. Many countries are present in this game and often allow you to choose specific branches within each countries military. I recommend this to anyone who is a fan of flght sims.Graphics: Shows its ageSound: Pretty goodGameplay: Excellent "

												I've played hundreds of hours on the disk version and only recently downloaded it on steam (hence my short steam play time). It's a damned good game that's aged spectacularly with a community that knows what's best. With the right mods and a good pc, this game will almost parallel more modern simulators - It also offers coverage of all theatres in World War 2; with mods, World War 1, the Cold War and even 21st century. It's cheap due to its vanilla state but when you download mods you'll realise that you were in for a bargain!			"

												While certainly is showing its age, it still has its strengths; such as an impressive number of available aircraft built up over the years. Where-as most games only come with a mere handful, this sim comes with literally hundreds of WW2 aircraft – and through 3rd party modification (such as CUP[www.sas1946.com]) there is hundreds and hundreds more, not just for WW2, but for WW1 through to modern. The flight models of these aircraft are also really well done – even by today’s standards. Plus it has to be said for the vast majority of these planes there is few to no alternative simulators where you will be able to fly them all in one package without huge expense or comprising flight model accuracy - at least until the newer IL-2 games have been expanded over time.Multiplayer is tricky but certainly functional and the game runs fine for me on Windows 10, but a certainly better experience with mods installed. If you have interest in WW2 aviation, or aviation in general then for the price of £6.99 for literally hundreds and hundreds of available aircraft to fly, you should have this title in your library.

												The game alone is about as close as you can come to an authentic world war two flight experience on any system (sorry games like Wings of Prey). The realism is there, plenty of flyable aircraft, plenty of awesome chaos and realism. Then, if you add in the free UltraPack mod, it really takes off-adding hundreds of new aircraft types well into the jet age (and ALL of them flyable), expanding mission options, and all kinds of good stuff to make this the war flight sim of your dreams. What if the Navy had the FJ-2 and sidewinder missiles at Pearl Harbor? You can find out! IL-2 1946 with the Ulrapack mod definitely provides for endless possibilities and endless hours of fun.			"

												This game is really hard, I honestly don't know how anyone can play a single mission without putting 'invulnerable' on.There are squillions of missions and careers and planes.Graphics are a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but it's a pretty old game so who cares?Flight dynamics are pretty nice, there is even a but of turbulence.If you want an entertaining combat flight sim with an immense playtime, get this game!!

												Because the game is older, it is somewhat unrealistic by today's flight simulation standards, but with a variety of missions, campaigns, and the ability to create your own missions, the game is still very fun! Also, this game has a bunch of mods to keep the game fresh and more realistic.			"

												The game itself is good. The only problem is that you need to get attached to the game so you can know the controls. The controls are hard because it is  a very realistic game. Its single player is good, the dynamic campaign is good. An overall 9.5 /10. It's worth the 10 dollars. If you pass by the game and can't afford their latest game, (Battle of Stalingrad) I suggest you buy this if you look at the upper-right of your steam account and see the amount of money left is not enough for the newest game.

												I put in a lot of hours into this game in my younger years. I found this game is quite a big step of from Microsoft's Combat Flight Sim series. The developers really put their lives into making this game great while creating it. The variety and accuracy of the fighters is truly impressive. The aircraft sounds can be a little repetitive, however the game has quite a bit modding capability.The quick scenario creator allows you to quickly create a mission in a logical and quick manner as opposed to Cliffs of Dover. Despite the older graphics engine, this game is a must have for any combat flight sim lover.			"

												I have over 500 hours on the pc dvd version that I ordered off of Amazon quite a few years ago. Pretty much the same game with a few improved astetics. This is a very good sim that just about has everything you can hope. I played the disk version on an  hp laptop (2007-2008 model with vista lol)  so I can't imagine there being very many rigs that cant run this adequately. I personally like the fighter escorts and instant action type scenarios. The dynamic campaigns are amazing but I've always struggled with the bomber campaigns. If you are a fan of combat flight sims or flight sims in general, then this is definite must have. If you can find it cheaper on amazon or another site then get it. Both versions are essentially  the same.			"

 Great Game!!!This game has tons of planes to fly but it does take a while to learn how to fly as you need to memorise lots of controls. It's only $10 and even though it doesn't have the best graphics, you don't buy this game for the graphics you buy it for the gameplay.			"

												UPDATE: Alt+tabbing out of the game seems to fix the unresponsive mouse problem (didn't work for me at first, not the games fault though) Anyways, this game is freaking awesome once you get past that little hitch, I highly recommend it!ps: use a flight/joystick!ORIGINAL REVIEW: Sounds like a great game, but so far I've been unable to do anything as the mouse cursor is unresponsive in the main menu. I've looked online and seen a few posts from people with similar problems, but nothing has worked for me yet. I can't recommend the game as it is since it simply doesn't work, but I'll happily update my review once this bug gets fixed.			"

												This game succeeds with FLYING colors in the variety of aircraft. Couple the base game's extensive list of flyable aircraft with that of mods and we have what I believe to be the most comprehensive WWII Flight Sim in terms of aircraft variety. Graphics look lke they're from 2001...because they are. This 17 year old game may still very well be the last word in WWII Flight Simulation. If not that, then it is at least the best value in the franchise, with the most aircraft and most accessible visuals able to run on pretty much any machine today. Be sure to play it with a flight stick though!			"
