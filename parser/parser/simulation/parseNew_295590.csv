												I MIGHT recomend this game with a caveat, please scroll to the bottom to see it, or better yet read the whole  review!(updated review posted below original)--Original review posted Jun 19, 2015--Just doesn't deliver.I wanted to like this game so much, I really did.  I liked the concept and I was hooked by the write up.  But it just doesn't deliver a fun and engaging experience.  The real and true fault to the game is that it doesn't do what the main hook of the game is delivered as.  The legacy system is really no different than a game reset in the long run.  In most roguelikes, you get a game over and maybe you've made some progress towards your next game.  In this one you have a limited number of turns, usually around 40 or so, and then the game forces you into and end scenario.  Often times you spend the last quarter of your life just trying to FIND a mate so that you can continue your legacy of mediocrity.So, it's billed as a ""roguelike/4X strategy game about life, legacy & love""4X ?  Maybe only in the very loosest of definitions.  Do you 'explore' yes, you explore a bland and ultimately uninteresting proceedurarly generated world.  But once you explore the area, it doesn't change in future legacy characters.  HOWEVER the fog of war DOES reset.  So either hope you have a really good memory or ask yourself why the fog of war reset. Do you 'expand' ?  I would say no.  You don't really have any classic base or sphere of influence that you expand.  Oh you can upgrade other towns, but since they 'rot' over a generation or two, there's no sense of actual building or accomplishment.Do you 'exploit' resources?  Yes, ok, this is one of the 4 ""x""es that you actually do.  You kill monsters, loot mines, find artifacts, etc.Do you exterminate?  Kinda.  You fight monsters and other 'heroes' like yourself, but there's no sense of accomplishment because they are constantly respawning every generation.  So it's more like whack a mole, not exterminating any enemy.Have you found the common thread in everything that I've written yet?  It's that the legacy system is basically broken in my opinion.  There's really no sense of accomplishment or forward progression.  You spend 20-25% of your turns looking for a mate to try to continue your legacy instead of trying to do quests or explore, and then you start all over with a new hero.  After playing for 90 minutes, I felt like I'd accomplished absolutely nothing upon my new hero.I might give this game another go if they do a signifigant update to the legacy system, but otherwise it's getting banished to the 'never to be played again' list of steam games.  On the off chance that Heart Shaped Games LLC reads this:Get rid of building decay, have coins automatically carry over on each legacy, and maybe a percentage of the previous hero's strength and / or fame.  Otherwise the whole legacy system in it's current incarnation is nothing more than a soft reset.--updated review Oct 13, 2015--Sometimes it's a shame that you can only 'reccomend' or 'not recomend' a game when you write a review.  Because with the recent update, I really don't know if I feel like a  ""YES"" or ""NO"" is exactly how I feel any longer.Scott a dev from heartshapedgames was kind enough to take the time and write a feedback response to my original review.  Let me say first of all any dev who takes the time to listen to feedback and reviews and then try to make their game better is already leaps and bounds ahead of others in the industry.  That point alone scores major points in my book.But lets get to the game and the changes.  I will try not to rehash my original review too much and focus on the changes that I noticed in my play time.Pro:-Building decay, this is a NOTICIBLE difference from when I played last time and a very much needed change.  The buildings still decay, but picking up a hammer or the right trait, and you can really make your buildings last forever.  Ignore them and they will rot away in a little while.  That's fine.  It's not like you have to rebuild every year.-Items: I don't know if this is just my memory, but it seems like there was a slew of new items dropping from the last time I played it many months before.  Training swords, hammers, rafts... these items were in the game but I only ever saw them in shops before.  It's entirely possible that I just missed them somehow during the first few hours of my play, I don't know.  But it does have a positive effect.Con:-I was really hoping the legacy system would be boosted just a little.  Everything I said in my original review still holds true.  Gold doesn't carry over, nor does strength.  Fame does to an extent, in that your legacy once built up starts to build, but it's very small.  It's a bit disheartening to have someone with an epic legacy and their child is a no body.  Really the son of Grokthak isn't even at ALL famous?- Fog of war.  I really don't understand why this exists at all on each new playthrough.  I could almost understand if there was a 'semi' fog of war, a see through fog of war on each generation that obscured the monsters, but let you see terrain previous generations had explored.  But since the world doesn't change between generations, resetting the fog of war just makes the game feel tedious when I'm thinking ""now which town had the strength forts, and which had the farms?""- Age, I've actually changed my mind on the whole 'looking for a mate' at the end of your life.  Since your strength goes down in old age, that's when you should be retiring from adventuring and settling down to find a mate.  So my gripe about that has been removed.... unfortunately it's been replaced by something else.  The 'age' that you become an adult and gain a strength boost is fine.  But middle age, and old age, shouldn't be 'set in stone' they should be a portion of your maximum life.  Far too often I found myself effectively being forced into 'late game' by age for a hero because he hit a magical wall of age and lost a chunk of strength.  Now I understand that any game has to have a 'game over' situation, and in this it's not finding a mate before you die.  But I feel like pushing that old age penalty back a bit would be a bit better.  Let me have the choice for one last epic battle with the dragon thing before seeking out a mate if I want to risk the loss.  By making me lose 10 or more strength, I know I'm going to have next to no shot.ANYWAYS, wrapping up, I DIDN't change my review from a 'no' I would not recommend this game.  However, it comes with a caveat.--THE CAVEAT--Now, for the average player, based just on the description in the store page, NO, I would not recommend this game.  However, that being said, I WOULD RECOMMEND this game, BUT with a caveat;I would recommend this game as long as people know what they are getting into first.Despite what it says on the store page, this game ISN'T a 4x strategy game.This game ISN'T really a roguelike.This game ISN'T really about life, legacy and love.This game ISN'T really anything like Civilization or legend of zelda.But what this game is, is a unique and interesting twist on tactical rpg-lite gaming.  It's more akin to a board game than anything else in my opinion.  But it can be very engaging and quite fun at times.  Especially for the price, it's not a bad way to while away a few hours.I feel like this is a pretty solid game, though it could be better, and hope that heartshapedgames continues to improve upon it.

												Repetitive and kinda boringThe game has some interesting concepts, the legacy feature for instance is really nice and should be part of RPG's like Fable like they were orginally promised :( -The combat in this game is purely random which is something I do not care for. You have to within your heroes lifespan develop the kingdom around you by building structures within cities that wil boost your stats. This is all good but in a certain amount of years those buildings will collapse and the city will decline. So you find yourself constantly runing back and forth building, upgrading and reparing buildings. -Your inventory is very limited (only 2 spots) which makes questing a hinderence since you can't carry a weapon and shield while picking up an ancient statue.......-Again Random combat is always a negative, if you get your hero up to 40 str your hero has a 0-40 chance to inflict combat damage, meaning your char with 40 str can lose to a minon with only 1-2 strg. (ANNOYING)-Lifespan is to short, by the time you get your hero strong enough to adventure and build up cities he/she is middleaged. Since each turn your hero takes counts as 1 year, 80 footseps comes sooner than you think. I am only glad that my 80 year old female hero can still reporduce. If you want a quick mindless strategy game, pick this up on sale, if you want something more polished pass on this			"

												This game can not be recommended because the developer is working on a Unity engine remake which will be sold separately to this Flash version. It's due to release in August 2016. The remake will make this version completely obsolete. If you're interested in playing this game search for ""Hero Generations Regen"" on Steam and click ""Follow"" or ""Add to wishlist"" and wait until it comes out instead of wasting your money now. It will probably be a fairly decent game if it's just various improvements on this version, which isn't terrible to begin with.I'm only posting this as a review to let people know because the developer doesn't want to put anything on this store page about it.

												It's a unique game, and while I give it a thumb down, I'd still recommend it to people that want something new that lasts 3-5 hours. Don't expect to get much more out of the game, the game brings some fresh elements, and the whole generations thing is pretty cool.The game is a bit repetitive and short, and from what I can tell there is no real end to it. You can figure out exploitive strategies pretty easily then explore and kill everything. Once you have done that there is nothing left to do. No proper end for you either. Gives you a very empty feeling.Game is a bit buggy, and could have better flow; it feels a bit slow.Overall it's a bit hard to just say YES or NO to the game because is not bad though neither is it great. It's just an OK game. At the same time it's a unique experience, and if you want to play games that gives you new experiences go for it.			"

												Huge fan of roguelikes. But this one bored me to tears.This game is very simple, which is good. It isn't challenging at all, which is a problem for me since challenging gameplay should be the hallmark of a good roguelike. The game also lacks depth. Hero Generations is a game about grinding that goes nowhere. Each generation sets up the future success of the next generation - but to what end? If I wanted pointless grinding I'd continue my life as a software developer. It's pretty fun to play, but nothing about my brief playthrough makes me want to come back and continue playing.The combat is extremely tedious - actions that should take less than half a second (or be instant) like dice rolls end up taking longer.I guess it comes down to this:It's not a terrible game, but for the price I would have expected much more. Would not recommend you spend your money on this, there are much better roguelikes/lites available. EG: FTL, binding of isaac, dungeon of endless			"

												A decent premise, marred by technical flaws.Major issues: Some Game-breaking bugs. Loading screens get stuck/crash, and tiles can become impassable at random. Needs a lot more QA. Resolutions are very broken. 1080p Max, windowed mode only; which often displays a 720p window. Causes the small text used in-game to appear blurry, and difficult to read. Some graphical anomalies, such as backgrounds/textures vanishing, requiring a restart. Info pane sometimes gets ""cut off"" at the bottom of the screen, letting you only read half of an instruction/info text.Gameplay/logic criticisms: Lives feel far too short, and stats are dictated almost entirely by dice rolls and random number generators. Subsequent generations of heroes lack any real feeling of progress as a result. Battles are fully dictated by dice roll/RNG mechanics; a lost battle feels far too punishing, taking away from an already short lifespan. Town/Structure building feels far too much like farmville/mobile tap-gaming. Re-visit tile for reward, re-visit tile to upgrade, re-visit tile to prevent building degredation.. with so few moves afforded per lifecycle, it feels like a forced grind to make your actual ""play"" session even shorter. Unless I'm missing out on a deeper meaning in the game's message, I'm quite sure two males cannot produce an offspring as of yet - or at least, not in a time period where train stations are a new invention. Name/appearance generation doesn't appear to pay any attention to supposed gender.While the idea is good, the execution unfortunately, is not. With some minor amounts of polish, and more QA, this title could have fared a whole lot better. If this were a beta/early access game, I'd feel it has promise.. but as a completed title, I would not recommend it.			"

												This First Impressions was Done with a key obtained from the developer. Hero Generations is a solid game and is a bunch of fun, and the mechanics that are within are interesting. The idea of building up a generation to try to build towards fame and gold is cool, and there's a lot of complexity to it, but at times, there's too much complexity. However, if you want a game that will reward you from learning mechanics and the world within it, Hero Generations is up your alley, because that's what it does best. But if you get frustrated with RNG elements, or want a high skill ceiling that's not based on strategy....you're probably not going to enjoy it.+:-Lots of options. Lots and lots of options. From buildings to items to traits. -Rewards planning and taking advantage of the RNG elements to your advantage.-Changes in your characters over time are pretty cool and a level of immersion to it.-Upgrades feel substanial. Like you need them.-Mechanics work well with each and there's obvious thought put into them working with each other. Feels woven together.-Difficult, to a good extent. Doesn't hand you everything. -Lots of replayability.- Art style is nice. -:-Goes one step too far at times. Building degradation is a fine example of it.  Simplicity might have been better in some cases.-RNG elements can get frustrating, especially when you lose a couple of bad rolls in a row.-Doesn't use screen space efficiently.-Tooltips would have added a lot to the experience.-Doesn't have a knockout punch: something that blows your mind. The thing is, it feels like it was just a  tiny bit off from doing that. For more first impressions and gameplay:

												Game is not what I expected. But perhaps my expectations were wrong, because I was unfamiliar with the roguelike genre. I had hoped that this game would be more like a sandbox in which you can play out your own stories. However, there is no way to create interesting stories in it at all.You can marry to have children (in fact: you always only have one child and after that you die, and play on with the child). Besides the marriage itself, there is never any interaction between your character and the one you marry. There is never an interesting interaction between parent and child and friendship is non-existent.In fact it's just some simple economics: building, harvesting, killing, gaining loot. Marrying is also entirely an economical decision. I think if that is what you play it for, it's fine.In general I tend to dislike it, when games that pretend to be about adventure, are in fact only about economics and statistics. Wastes the theme for me.			"

												Kongregate-tier game with an interesting concept.When you retire, FOW resets in the map you are in, but not in other maps. The map doesn't change, mind you, so the FOW reset is only there to frustrate. Combat resolution is too random and simplistic. If you try to pick up an item when your inventory is full, you can't just swap it with something you have: you have to go to a different square and drop it there (literally spending two years to manage inventory). Etc. etc.You can get it if it goes on sale for like -60%, I guess. It can be fun, but it's totally not worth the price.			"

												Easy to learn game that offers quite a few hours of fun. Pros-It keeps getting updates -Good concept-Roguelike-Allows you to feel strong just to watch you fail-Health used as a new kind of barrier-Pretty tested and mostly bug freeCons-short, easy to replay but the game needs to have 3x the size-Maybe a little too random, its possible for your world crushing hero to lose to a basic bandit 1/100 of the time-Lack of real customization-Generations dont feel meaningful, you can pretty much skip the first 10Overall i would recomend this to anyone who wants something they can waste 10 hours mastering and come back for the updates.

												I want to like this game more than I do, because it really does have a lot going for it. It's a Rogue-like 4X-lite with novel approaches to the way it handles some of the systems and is definitely not more ""been there, done that"". I can't recommend this game in it's current state, however, because there is a major glitch that makes one of the core features frustratingly punishing: buildings, once erected, only last X amount of turns before they degrade and vanish unless you keep coming back periodically to repair them before this turn timer runs out. The glitch is that sometimes these buildings will deteriorate away whether the turn timer is over or not, which makes planning your buildings for future generations a dicey proposition as you never know if the buildings will last as long as they are supposed to or not. This is not a new glitch judging from the forums, Unless and until the glitch is taken care of, as the planning of buildings for future generations is a MAJOR part of the game, I can only recommend picking this one up if there is a really good sale going on.

												It's a cute little game but once you get the hang of it, there's not much to do. The word is limited and once you've explored and cleared all 6 areas of your playthrough, there is nothing to do, as an area only refreshes when a hero is born in that area only. Also the only thing you have to strive for is fame. Yes, the life limit curtails how much you can get and you can strive for a high score, but once you've discovered and gotten the vampirism trait, you can extend your life almost infinitelly by simply attacking other heroes on the world in hospital areas. I managed to get a character to 200+ life expectancy by just grinding combat. At that point, you can take your fame as high as you want, as long as you can tolerate the immense grind. I reached 65k before I gave up.Get this game only if you can get it on a good offer.			"

												New games start off very slow.  Roguelike means that you can easily be screwed over by randomly generated maps through no fault of your own.  RNG combat can completely gut any sense of accomplishment you might have achieved through stat building.  Story isn't interesting.  Artwork is juvenile.  Very poor UI, no in game menus, no full screen option, lots of blank, uninteresting, unused space.  Hero Generations isn't hard due to genius design, it is frustrating due to poor design.

												Overall I had quite a lot of fun with Hero Generations. It's what it says on the label: A fun strategy roguelike. It has a solid tutorial and the core gameplay is easy to learn hard to master. Traits randomly passing down from both parents is an interesting mechanic and forces you to try and woo the best mate each generation. Also, buildings are named after their builder and age which gives the feeling that time is actually passing. Unfortunately though once you do master it you will quickly find that it isnt balanced particularly well. By the 3 hour mark I had found a way to cheese the game and become a 1000s of years old vampire living off the drained lifeforce of other adventurers. Kinda arguable who the real villian is in the game at that point. There are also a few glitches that still remain in the game that at this point I'm assuming are there to stay, they are not game breaking though so not a huge deal. Despite these negatives it was still quite a bit of fun for around 5 hours, but once you've killed and done everything there really doesn't feel like any reason to start again. TLDR: A simple but deep strategy roguelike that despite a few balance issues and glitches still managed to keep me entertained for around 5 hours, definitely recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games and roguelikes.

												This game is very fun and addictive. There are ways to increase your lifespan so that you have more time but watch out once you character hits old age he's going to start losing strength. I sometimes had a generation where I had my person mate early barely accomplishing anything because it gave me way more card  flips for my child who came out seriously strong and acomplished enough for the both of them. I suggest having a ""family man/woman""every few generations or at least once in the beginning.But anyway great game very fun. The enemies not too easy not too hard. Awesome!			"

												SHORTER: A fusion of light rougelike rpg, 4x, and generational planning that's straddles the line between ease of play and complexity.  A good game if you're looking for an adventure-fusion game that's fast to pick up, but has challenge, and if you like experimental games.Hero Generations starts with a hero, who goes into the world, gains fame and gold and equipment, builds towns, and then dies.  Sure, the monsters may get you, but your real enemy is age.  Heros age and die, each turn is a year of their life, and that can burn away quickly.To build a legacy you can construct buildings, win fame, discover equipment, and find mates to parent the next generation of heroes.  As generations progress new buildings are unlocked, and as you build towns change and grow, and you can explore different worlds, each with something unique.  Quests are given in each world to give you something to strive for, but you'll probably have plenty of your own goals, from making specialized towns to getting to a particuarly inacessible area.The game mechanics are simple:* Move around the map.* Age and gain (or loose) abilities.* Find assorted treasures, monsters, items, and features.* Interact with those things in simple ways - combats, for instant, are decided by a single die roll.* Build around towns or upgrade buildings - which provide many benefits and can change the nature of towns.* Find a mate is impressed with your stats and parent the next generation.* Choose the traits of your child.* Lead the child on their adventure.Though simple on many levels, the game's strength is how elements interact.  Towns change their nature (and the mates available) depending on what's near them.  Different items afford different advantages.  Different buildings provide different bonuses or tributes.  As you play, you find more and more ways to benefit from the elements of the game and adventure deeper - there's always something new to explore.Its the kind of game to appeal to people who like to make long-term plans - literally generational in this case.Visually, the game has a very charming, cartoony style; bright colors, amusing characters with lots of variance, vibrant backgrounds.  It's got its own look which really makes it memorable and enhances the enjoyment.The greatest strength of the game is how it manages to be both simple to play and offer a lot of complexity at the same time.  Gameplay is very easy, almost casual, and fast to pick up - but the depth of the game requires thought.  Yes, you're controlling a cartoony adventurer, but when you experiment with creating specialized towns, or plotting how to build roadways all over the world, you realize just how complex the game can get - and yet it's still easy to play.If there's an issue with the game it's that some people might find it boring after awhile.  It yields its secrets to experimentation, exploration, luck, and persistence - and you may not exactly be up for spending three generations getting a town just right.  If that's your thing, good, but it may not be for everyone - the game's unusual fusion really is it's own thing.The game seems to have good support, and even after release the author is integrating feedback and improving it.  The game's definitely finished, but the author is open minded about improving it - or reversing a bad choice or two.I consider it a buy for fans of rogeulike, adventure, and planning/4x games who want something easy to play but with some depth.  You can figure it out fast, then enjoy the complexity it offers.I also consider it a definite buy for people who like to explore something experimental.  The game's cobination of elements, the way it implements them, is worth exploring for people that like to find something different.			"

												I initially rated this game positively, even though it had some underwhelming qualities to it. However, as the updates rolled in, the game only got better. Content-wise it still has a little ways to go, but technically, Hero Generations improved; it got fullscreen, combat was quickened, gameplay in general became smoother.I really appreciate the developer for being dedicated to improving the game. A score of 65% positive? Unacceptable, this game is very decent, and that's being said with the fact that it can still be better! If you like a simple RPG with 4x elements, try this game out. It's really a labor of love.Original Review: I fell in love with this game the moment I saw it hit Steam on the front page. There's something magical about it - it's clearly the labor of love. The gameplay is simple, yet strategic. The graphics are simple, yet charming. The combat is simple, and yet again, tense with every roll.That isn't to say that the game doesn't have it's faults. With the simple traits, a lot is left to be desired in terms of content variety itself. Although you have quests, it seems that most of them are pretty much the same thing with different names. Inventory is too small for quest items, and overall, it's clearly under-developed at this point, so much that it would seem reasonable to put it under Alpha (not in a negative sense, but in a realistic sense).However, the developer replies to almost every concern brought up, and has already fixed one game-breaking issue with saves. If this trend of correcting bugs and adding future content updates, I have no trouble believing that he will continue to updating the game and making it the next smash hit on Steam.As of now, it's a 7.5/10, but with the future, I have no troubles beliving it could be a 9.5/10			"

												What will you leave behind? That's the question that Hero Generations poses to the player. Every step is a year of your life. One step closer to the grave.Hero Generations is deceptively simple from the outside. Adorable graphics and minimalist UI make it easy to approach and play. However with its Roguelike and 4X elements. Careful planning and thinking ahead is rewarded. Making it required to make progress in this game. Suddenly each step isn't so simple and the games complexity truly shines. Now sadly, Hero Generations does suffer from some basic technical problems. Lack of manual save, fullscreen support, save data corruption to name a few. With time these issues will be patched up though. If you enjoy any of the aforementioned genres. Hero Generations is an enjoyable, easy to play title. That offers plenty of replay.I made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!

												""Hero Generations"" has the potential to get repetitive as the general gameplay flows a little something like: start new generation, move around the map accomplishing various tasks (aging in the process), head back to town to mate, start new generation, and rinse and repeat.  I do like the fact that some of your traits carry over from previous generations and that your mate does influence the type you can potentially have, though there is a random luck of the draw factor involved as you'll be choosing from multiple face-down (sometimes face-up) cards that determine the stats of your new character.  The concept reminds me a smidge of ""Rogue Legacy"", though the gameplay is obviously different (platformer vs 4x).  As repetitive as it is, I still find myself enjoying it.  Every move you make takes a year off your life, so there's a lot of time management involved and hard decisions to be made with every generation.  Love the idea personally, though I'm not crazy about the luck factor involved with combat (both characters roll a die, the range values determined by their maximum strength).  All in all, I had a good experience with this one...though you may want to watch a few let's plays to see if it suits your fancy since it is rather different than most games on the market.

												Tl;dr: I wasn't disappointed. While playing the tutorial I thought it looked a bit empty, and also echoed the sentiments I'd seen on here that it looked like a mobile game (plus had no full screen support). BUT, after playing for a few minutes, it got pretty addictive. The RNG aspect can be off putting to some, but I found this to be like a pick up and play HoMM or King's Bounty - it's a tough nut to crack but the contents are rewarding. The dev is a one-man team, and more updates are being pushed so looking forward to more content, enemies and worlds.			"

												I found Hero Generations to be an interesting little rogue-like game.  Unlike other rogue-likes I've played, this one seems to have much more on an adventuring aspect to it.  There are six world areas to explore with various quests to complete in each world.  You start with a character, and each step you take reduces your life.  Before you die, you must find a partner, so that your child can continue your legacy.Your children inherit some of the traits / abilities of your character, so as time goes along, your lineage will generally grow more and more powerful.  During each lifetime, it takes time for your character to get into decent fighting shape.  There is always a push-pull tension in wanting to complete more in this lifetime, and making sure you have time to find a mate and spend time with your child.There were a number of design decisions that will make or break this game based on personal preference.    1)  The battle system is simplistic.  2)  The character can only carry two items.  3)  There is a limited lifetime on a per character basis.4)  Buildings degenerate over time.None of them were game breakers for me and they made for some interesting decisions that needed to be made throughout the game.I have put together an example playthrough for those who are interested:  World 1 Playthrough [slggames.com]Gameplay aside, there do seem to be a few technical issues that need to be resolved.  Like other reviewers have noted, I would have liked to have a full-screen mode.  I have also experienced some of the save game issues.  While not a big deal with shorter games, a late game character being lost to a save bug is a sure recipe for moving on.  There is also some lag after some battles that you hope the game will recover from.  I fully expect these to be resolved, but they need to be noted here.			"

												A fun, unique 4X. A lot of the poor reviews are from tech issues of old; just today fullscreen was added. The game is actively being developed even after release.You start as a nobody Hero, building farms and strongholds, trying to impress a good mate or two. Soon you're exploring new biomes, slaying bosses for Honor, and uncovering secrets. The biomes feel distinct. You will genuinely care about your cute little heroes and their legacies. You will find the perfect mate and make demigods with them. You'll delve into the heart of a volcano and ride airships.The game's fairly fast-paced. A generation could go by in five minutes, ten minutes if you're really going for something special. (30k honor) Even with a poor mate, it's hard to get a useless offspring. If you do get lackluster child, you can use that generation to build your towns up. You're always progressing because of this, there's always a way to improve yourself somehow.The game offers a fair challenge: it took me about 5.5 hours to beat over three separate game files, and I didn't truly ""beat"" it. You will certainly need to employ strategy and forward-thinking.Some weaknesses.- Two items can be stressful to manage. You want to maintain your buildings with a hammer while also building your hero's legacy. At least because of this, the game has you making hard decisions between two traits and two item slots.- Combat needs some kind of minimum damage formula. It is possible to have 120 strength and lose to someone with 20 strength if they roll a 20 and you roll a 19, as improbable as that is. While it thereby offers lucky shots to the player, you will only take lucky shots in the most dire of moments.- Needs just a bit more polish. The screens will transition to a mostly-white combat screen, where the combat really should just pop up in a separate view.			"

												Really clever game. Does a lot better job of doing a multiple generation rogue-like than Rogue Legacy, I feel, and has quite a few interesting ideas behind it that I've never seen in other games, and that's pretty rare nowadays. It does seem like it's possible to beat, but I couldn't figure out how to stop the volcano without dying in my 10th generation first. Overall I highly recommend it.			"

												The concept of this game is what drew me in. I really like the idea of progressing a family through multiple generations. The year a move concept is good and keeps the game going at a fast pace. It seems to play well, and it is enjoyable. The save feature has been fixed as of the latest update!I wish that the zones were easier to find the end realm. I was just frustrated with a 30k fame character with 150 years left, wasting every year because I could not find the volcano zone. I've also been hemmed in by mountains and a boss mob that would not move for six years.Overall I'm really enjoying the game though and will play more as I have time.			"

												I am both changing the nature of my review and my recommendation of this game. The game is addictive and simple. It's as complex as you want to make it while giving you anywhere from 5 minutes to 5 hours of roguelike creativity.The developer got involved in the save issues people were experiencing right away. He reached out to players to address concerns and fix them. That doesn't mean the game is without problems anymore(I still don't know how lighthouses work since they seem to act differently at different times), but the game breaking ones are fixed and the fast action of the developer shows that the other minor issues will also be addressed.If you think the game looks interesting, you are right and you should buy it.Original Review:I just got lost in this game for hours. It was engrossing and totally stole my Saturday, no complaint. Until I went to reload my 25th Generation, four world connected empire that was preparing to move into the desert and it was all gone. I loaded up at the end of a tutorial generation. The game isn't auto saving. When that gets fixed I will recommend the game. Until then its worthless.			"

												Hero Generations is a light rouge-like game. The tension between adventuring with your powerful hero versus settling down before you are too old to properly train the next generation is quite nice. After 5 hours of play, I can say this is certainly a fun game, but I'm unsure of how long that fun will last.In comparison to my favourite rouge-like -FTL- Hero Generations seems to offer more freedom and strategic choice, while still being relatively simple and accessible. Where FTL wins out is on theme and artwork. I like the multi-generation mechanic in Hero Generations, I just wish your potential mates didn't all look like ugly trolls with gender miss-matched names. This may have been meant as light humour or a statement on gender issues, but for me is a weak piece of world immersion. It would be easier to get excited about finding potential mates(male or female) if they looked a little nicer. Hero Generations is a small game of exploration, adventure, and strategic choice with some weaknesses in presentation. I'd recommend this game if you can pick it up on sale.If you'd like to see some gameplay you can watch a let's play here:

												Hi, I bought and have been playing this game, and I just wanted to say I love it and have already reccomended it to friends, and I'd also 100% reccomend this to anyone wondering whether or not this game is worth it.So firstly I'll explain a little about what it is: its a casual paced strategy game with fun rpg elements. It's hard to beat! You'll get better as you go along and learn what works and how this and that works and when to go where and such, but luck and strategy are HUGE factors in this game.It looks to be from where I've gotten to that in order to beat the game you need to do most of your progress within one single generation, that generation will need to be some generations in as you'll need to work to building a strong foundation and do some exploring first, all of which takes many generations - some luck and some skill. The fountain of youth found in the meadows I think it was, would be really good for when you go to beat the game, but yeah,.... this game is pretty hard to beat.Anyway just gonna say it again I love this game and if anyone doesn't find this or other reviews to be helpful enough try finding this game on youtube, just keep in mind its a lot more fun to play than to watch, the gameplay is the selling point not the graphics. Peace.			"

												I regret this purchase very much. I do not know why the reviews are positive overall, since I can't imagine enjoying this game past about an hour. The concept is incredible, and they have the framework for it, but it's terribly executed beyond that. There just isn't enough content, and some of the systems, like the item and trait system, feel rushed and don't make very much sense. It's like they had these huge ambitions, made the world system, which is very well-done, realized they didn't have time/money to do what they wanted to, and haphazardly put together the rest of the game.I don't ever write reviews, and don't care to explain in detail, but I think a thought I had repeatedly while trying to play Hero Generations sums it up quite well: ""Why did I just pay $10 for a crappy Facebook game?""EDIT 4/18/15: I still do not recommend this game for the time being, but the developer appears to be paying genuine attention to reviews like this, and it seems like they intend to address many of the issues that negative reviews like this brought up. This is very interesting, so I will stay tuned and update the review if my opinion changes.EDIT 7/1/15: The developer seems to be devoting continued honest effort to improving the game based on community opinions. I have not played it in quite some time due to a lack of free time for games in general, but I will be clearing out a couple hours in the near future to update the review based on recent patches.

												Where a traditional roguelike is typically about learning the enemies and their abilities so you can decide how to deal with them, Hero Generations introduces more random elements to combat and uses the lifespan and generational mechanics to make the player focus more on the long term. Every decision must take the hero's remaining years and potential legacy into account. Is it worth fighting anything as a teenager, when the hero's strength is low? Should I repair that building so it will be there for the next hero at the expense of losing a card flip to get them another bonus?Even though I don't really buy into Hero Generations being a roguelike/4X hybrid, the 4X elements that have been woven into the game make it play differently from other roguelikes. It's turn- and grid-based in traditional roguelike fashion, but deviates far enough from the traditional mold that I'm tempted to call it a roguelite instead. I'm not sure how well die-hard fans of old-school roguelikes will like it. As a fan of both roguelikes and roguelites, I like it quite a bit.Read my full review at  IndieGames.com [indiegames.com] .			"

												Hero Generations is a fun light strategy game, all about raising successive generations of heroes. It shows it's Flash roots, but the graphics are crisp and clear and I like the art style. I like how you can build buildings to develop the world slowly over time and the pass genetic traits and items down to the next generation. The forest world you start in is pretty easy but the game gets challenging fast, the volcano world almost killed me and the desert world had lots of challenges (I haven't explored the swamp and island worlds yet). The game has a simple concept, but it executes it well.The bugs I encountered have been fixed and the developer has been good at responding to complaints. Apparently he's working on a fullscreen mode next. This is not a game that will suck up hundreds of hours of your life, but it is definitely worth trying if you want to play a strategy game that is a little different than what you're used to.			"

												I was one of the backers for this game, and I have been waiting for it with joy. This game is easy to learn, fun to play, and no two players will ever have the same experience. Not just due to the fact that this is rogue-like, but because of the many different strategies. Are you a fighter, a builder, a scholar, a lover, or are you just in it for the money? Your child will benefit from what you bring with you, but not so much, that every generation plays the same way. I fully recommend this game, for the completionist, there is plenty to do in every world, and it hurt me a bit, that I had to look away from some of them, just due to my poor breeding. But it only adds to the fun. Buy it, be a hero. Or just retire early and see how many generations you can get!			"

												Quite a fun game however I've yet to be able to complete a game due to some bug preventing me for being able to move for example. I bought that game based on reviews that claimed it has a lot more depth to the game than you would imagine. This has not been my experience. I find that I can ignore all the buildings except the ones that give strength. Spam those and you can kill anything. This has worked on each world so far. As a result I've found that I've become quickly bored of the game.The traits and card system really hasn't made any difference to the way I play and influences the gameplay in such an insignificant way that it quickly becomes a chore to have to keep picking the cards.I hope there is more to come because the game does have a lot of potential. Priced at 1.99 on mobile devices it would be a good deal but I feel it's overpriced for what you get on the PC.			"

												A board game with RPG and Rogue-Like elements is the best way to describe Hero Generations. In short, it's fantastic! This is one of those games where it's better to watch some videos and form your own opinons though because I can see how it caters to a niche audience. I did a quick ""getting started"" playthrough so you can see the game in action before dropping $15. Enjoy!

												It's a fairly mediocre game with good ideas. Over all I like it, I've definitely gotten my moneys worth out of it. Though at the same time it feels lacking. While it has good ideas, I feel there is room for many improvements. The idea of a year of your life per move is lovely, till you realize you never have time to do anything if you want to gain any kind of bonus's for your next generation. You can spend an entire generation just maintaining towns (as unless you have a late-game building you and your kin are the only people who see the need to invest in towns and maintain them).Though with active creators trying their best to continually improve it I'd still recommend it with a warning, it's not for everyone. It still has room to grow and it has some downsides (like the combat, I enjoy me some good RNG but I prefer risk to reward rather than just pure risk).			"

												Hero Generations is an enjoyable, unique take on rougelikes with mechanics I'd love to see pop up in other games.Just spent most of my afternoon playing this game. Like the namesake you are guiding your character through multiple generations of questing, monster slaying and loot gathering. There's a lot to understand so I'd suggest playing the tutorial. It's a good primer for what you need to do to get started.Here's a video of the tutorial - (It's probably still loading)

			Views: 19		

			This was my first attempt of the game on a new save up until my untimely death. Hero Generations can be found now on Steam http://store.steampowered.com/app/295590/ Or Online -...		

The way Hero Generations works is you start as a young adult. Each step you take in the world is 1 year and you have a number of years you are expected to live (shown on the right side of the screen). During that time you must build around towns to earn wealth, go fight monsters to gain fame, and ultimately woo some potential mates that have good genetics you can carry over to your children. As you age you'll hit a few milestones in your life (Adult, Middle Age, Elder, Sage) ideally you want to mate earlier to get more picks at the gene pool so to speak. The mechanics of starting a new generation are one of the unique features of this game that I find enjoyable. Depending on what traits you acquire along the way and those of your mate you'll be presented with a grid of cards, imo these cards represent genes. You pick a certain number of them to design your successor. It's a random mix that is influenced by yourself and the mate you choose and the number of picks are decided by certain traits, what town you're in and the age you are when you settle down. Once picked you start over again and continue the legacy to to stop some evil. I didn't find the evil so I don't know what it is exactly. Your goal is to continue building up cities and earning power and wealth over time to eventually make your way to the end game (My first game I needed to get 30k fame in one life and go talk to some guy in the volcano world, I didn't make it =(I found this game incredibly enjoyable. Trying to min/max the steps I was taking to figure out the best way to collect items. Figuring out that building 3 of the same building around a town changes the town into a special building. There's so much to find (I found a cave the appeared once I had a certain amount of fame). Here's a video of my first playthrough from start to my untimely demise. (It's Still Loading It's about 90 minutes)

 A couple things did bug me though.The ability to only carry 2 items hinders the experience of actual exploration considering each step is precious life. It forces you to move to an empty space to drop the item then go back and pick up the other one.This also creates a problem where you'll have multiple items on the ground in the same tile space with no real control over which item to pick up. A simple mouse over menu on the right hand side to allow you to select what you want to interact with would be perfect.The RNG with attacking is frustrating as well, when you reach a certain point you will find your self with 100+ strength, so when attacking you roll your strength  against your enemies and it does this from 0. So rolling super low against a monster you should easily beat becomes a bit aggravating. Overall Hero Generations delivers a different kind of rougelike open world experience. One that I find charming, unique and overall enjoyable.-Angelo @EAPFor more Early Access and Indie reviews and bi-weekly podcast check out EarlyAccessPodcast.com and youtube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast "

												Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I haven't found any overarching goal to this game. It seems all you do is run around and amass points for no particular reason. Building structures is a nice touch, but the choices hardly matter. Whenever you switch to one of your heirs, the whole map becomes hidden in the fog of war again. Doesn't really serve any purpose other than that you have to memorize what you built where and complicate planning out routes.I've only played this game for about an hour, but I really don't see a point in going on since there seems to be a lack of an endgame goal, other than points.

												Hero Generations takes an interesting concept and turns it into a game that you can pick up for a few minutes or spend hours with. The gameplay is fairly simple, but there is a surprising amount of complexity in the number of ways you can build your towns and the world around you. Migrating to different worlds also gives you new areas to explore, so if things start to get stale you can always head off in search of adventure.			"

												I approached this game with my arms open. The art style is super cute, the legacy mechanic is amazing. And i mostly liked the game, having put  8  hours of my time into it.It's just so little. You get six worlds with a limited amount of towns in such a way that at some point (2 hours into a playthrough, less if you're good) the world will be fully explored with nothing else to do. That was kind of a dissapointment.That said, the game would massively improve if it introduced a way to increase the length of the game. I'm thinking of two ways.a) An infinite size, procedurally generated universe would allow you to hunt for highscores without having to wait for quests to reset.b) This feels so much like a board game that i'd love to see a multiplayer implementation - where up to 4 people, who start in different places, compete for fame (and the winner is either the last one standing or the one with the highest peak fame after N generations)			"

												So I loved this game when it came out, was loads of fun for 20$ or however much it was at launch. Was browing my games for something to play and remembered this, then recalled I had a coupon in my inventory for hero generatios. Was thinking about getting collectors and playing it again, if that's what coupon was for...Little to my knowladge this game was abandoned for them to remake it and add a lot of features that were missing from this 1... Scumbag move Dev's, and people gave Wild Card hate for their honestly amazing DLC that was made by an entierly seperate team, while main team kept working on main game. The only game that comes to mind for scumbag dev's is The War Z...Which I had bought a legendary pass to its kickstarter because it was going to be worlds better then dayZ, right up until they ♥♥♥♥ed it up. Added Microtransactions, got lots of hate and abandonment. Then renamed the game, kept going for a while, before most of the programer team quits to remake it again forgot that trainwreck's name, before Pimp w/e the Dev's remade and renamed it yet again. All of these were sold seperatly, but the first 2 could still play with original version, but lost all the♥♥♥♥♥♥you payed extra for.			"

												This game is still in beta even though it is out on full release. I actually really like this game a lot. My advice is to wait 6 or more months down the line when it is really finished.  Please take caution in purchasing this as the save file corrupts which will force you to delete your save and start over again.

			Views: 67		

			At the time of publishing this, this game is still in beta even though it is out on full release. This is a great game if you can get this a 6 or more months down the line.		

Update:To the developer: I respect what you as a 1 man team has done. I being someone who knows a lot about computer software/engineering know the amount of work that is required.  However, I must let my (bad) review stand because of the misjudgement of the timing of the release of the game which was still buggy and clearly a ""Beta"" version of the game.  It's absolutely inexcusable to buy something that doesn't quite work correctly but then be told that it will later on. Bugs I can live with and updates that better the game are fine but not crashes and freezes. I will give a deeper review below for those still interested in reading it.  After reinstalling the game I tried Hero Generations and found myself again liking the game.  Surely many of the bugs I had pointed out in my review are seemingly gone which is the good news.  The bad news seems to be the ""end game"".  Around the 15th generation you realize that you have explored all 6 areas and have killed just about all of the ""bosses"".  Then you ask yourself the question, ""Now what?"" I went and built up everything after all of the generations and...I feel as if there's nothing left to do once I get there.  The most frustrating part of the game are the items inventory system.  EVERYTHING requires an item and you can only ever hold 2 at one time.  How can I bear to put down my sword of awesome for a baby when I am about to walk into the volcano of death so that I may place a baby onto an altar?  Now you might say that I can replace said ""attack power"" by picking up more strength potions and damage potions for my character but that requires my hero to age.  Of course within a certain period of time my character only has a finite amount of years in his/her lifetime and it only becomes a chore to get the ""right"" combination for hopefully one of my future generations to achieve the goal of simply placing a baby on an altar. Again I will say that the game is fun.  I like trying to build up my hero to a certain degree and I love randomly choosing cards at the end of each life to hopefully have a better shot than dear old dad.  The only problem lies in what you do once you receive said thoroughbred?  Hopefully this will help future players out there in deciding whether or not to purchase this game.  TLDR: Heroes Generations is a delightful game marred by its lack of end game flair.			"

												Hero generation is a great and refreshing take on strategy mixed with adventure game. You take on a role of a hero and slowly build up infrastructure gather equipment for you heirs to take over your legacy and hopefully improve the land you live in. Game is fast paced very easy to understand even for total novice yet entertaining for strategy veterans. I enjoyed playing it a lot and I am looking forward to playing more in the future.I however encounter some bugs that are worth noting game fps have periods of dropping to crazy low levels it makes experience a bit less fun at times but is not a big deal considering game is turn based. I also had some problems with save files as they didn’t load properly at all time so it is something that will need to be fixed.Apart of that I believe game will give you countless hours of fun and is definitely worth it’s price of $15.99 I would be more than happy to pay more for it. I have made first impression video in which I talk about my experience with the game explain mechanics and give you a chance to see actual gameplay before you make your purchase decision.

												Alright, so I just got this game.. And I like it, I think it's a lot of fun, it's sort of like a lite Roguelike and a Civilization game rolled up into a bite sized game. There are issues that kind of make you feel like you aren't making progress. For starters, there's a ""world disaster"" event in the game and the count down to it is far too short, you've barely just started playing when it makes itself known.Further, any upgrades you make around other towns degrade slowly over time, even with the black smith utility. What makes this frustrating is, there's not really a point to upgrading each ""world"" unless you intend to spend any extended amount of time there. It feels like wasted resources and can be aggravating.The random element of the combat can be frustrating; it's all based on simple dice rolls. And even if you have a ability of 200 and are fighting a enemy with an ability of 30, there's still a chance they'll beat you. There's gear and buffs you can get later on, that add on bonuses to your ability and strength, which helps a lot, but early on, it's a problem.The game isn't really polished all that much either. There's been a few glitches I've run into that is really frustrating. The first is that the game is supposed to save after every move, but several times now my save files decided to just delete themselves or become something entirely different. Another issue I've been running into is, suddenly the game just won't let me move or skip any turns. The game is still running, I can open the quest menu, I just can't move. The game needs a little more polishing, there's some mechanics that could really stand to be changed and there's a few bugs to squash, but besides that, the game is fairly fun and the price tag isn't bad. Even with the issues I have had, I still can recommend it to like minded players.			"

												I like the game.  Addictive. better resolution to be played, 1280x720 on tv screenDeveloper would make a clan Name for all characters' lineage. First enter your clan name, and then, current new born character. Sometimes, appears male or female names to opposite sex, but you can rename. "

												This is a great blend of roguelikes, a stripped down 4X and Desktop Dungeons.  It is not puzzle-y and there is some real depth to the game.  The retire and start with the next generation mechanic and all of the variations that can arise from that is a great addition.  I love the game.			"

												Wouldn't recommend. For $15 you can get games with far more content. You'd think a game with the concept of raising heroes and going through countless generations would have a lot of replayability to it but it got old fast. I was disappointed in the player models and I didn't like how you couldn't raise your base attack. You could be extremely strong and still roll lower than the weakest of the weak. Game was pretty laggy as well.			"

												Hero Generations really disappointed me.I'm not sure what I was expecting quite honestly but it certainly wasn't this. The game feels like an overblown demo. There's some interesting mechanics that would work much better in another, more focused game, but the mechanics as they are here, are rudimentary and boring.Combat is by far the biggest down point. Roll a dice and see who wins the fight. I understand that its meant to be quick, but I really wish the developers could have come up with something much more fulfilling than click to roll and watch.  The building system, while interesting in theory, is another bore that requires micromanaging with minimal inputs. The interface is very tiny and doesn't utilize its space properly. The beautiful artwork is at a disservice when its so small. And for a game with a very stripped down look and feel, the animations for basic functions (like mating) seem to drag on.I'm simply amazed that this game felt completely different than what I saw in the trailer, read about in articles and funded during the kickstarter.I'm still glad I did fund this game though, even if it didn't live up to my expectations of it. For those that enjoy it, I encourage you to keep playing. For the rest of us that want a bit more excitement from a one-click game, I'm advise looking elsewhere.			"

												Why is this game not labeled as in ""Early access"" or alpha/beta is beyond me.  I will retouch this review after some patches and updates, but currently I cannot reccomend that anyone buy this game.  Why?  Thats simple, I cannot even play it.  Loading it up initially I ran into the first bug, where the game doesn't properly fit into the window size, which is a known bug for other players as well.  Which makes the bottom portion of the game unviewable and unable to progress after a certain part in the tutorial when I have to click buttons I cannot access.  Secondly, when I try to load a save game it just freezes on the loading screen.  I deleted the save game, started a new game, saved and once again the save was corrupted.  And this is after the v 1.15 patch that was supposed to fix this bug.  It looks fun, it sounds fun, and heck I will probably like the game when I can play it, but as of now that is not possible.			"

												A fun little game. It lets you run around and play how you want. Build up cities, kill monsters or do both at the same time. There are a few problems though. After every few moves the game auto saves. The delay is pretty noticiable. Even worse, The game is not able to load those saves when you close the game sometimes. So you could lose whatever work you've put into the game. But at less than $15 it's still a pretty decent time killer. It would probably do well as a mobile game.			"

Posted: April 13, 2015
												EDIT: There is now a newer version of this game, Hero Generations: ReGen. Get that instead.Hero Generations is a casual, fairly quick playing, turn-based, semi-roguelike game.(Note that problems many early players experienced with the save system, resulting in a number of negative reviews, should now be fixed.)The game is pleasant and relaxed, not requiring a huge amount of in-depth thought or strategizing, which suits me just fine. It’s easy to pick up and put back down on whim - sometimes one just wants to vege-out and click, explore a world, and have battles resolved by a quick random number generator (RNG).Early in the game you are intentionally exposed to a little fear and anxiety, and a part of that is avoiding battles until you're stronger. Later you get the satisfying feeling of stomping creatures that you earlier feared.The game achieves all this in a quick and streamlined way that is dead-easy to pick up and play without an extensive tutorial, and without having to memorise 16 thousand different spells and item combinations.RNG is only a small part of the game, as a lot of the decision making is based around deciding how much risk to take in combat - do you push your luck and take on a 50/50 chance of success with an evenly matched opponent, or do you avoid those battles until you are powerful enough to ensure that the odds of an unlucky RNG roll are minimal.If you're fighting units two thirds your strength you can fairly expect to lose, on average, one in three battles. If you don't like those odds you will need to level your strength up further before taking on those battles.Consequently, the bulk of gameplay is about boosting your hero's base strength, which is primarily achieved by collecting gold through light questing, and by constructing buildings to generate either more gold, or that provide strength and damage boosts. The buildings you construct mostly accumulate over generations, so eventually you will have put together a small strength and gold generating machine around your core villages.Loss in combat is a minor annoyance (slightly reducing your lifespan by around 5 'years' (turns) until you need to retire), and the law of averages evens out the occasional unlucky die roll over time.It is possible for your lineage to end if you push your luck too far and get caught out in the wilds with only a few years left to get back to a town and find a potential mate. Your lineage can also end in the rare instance that you haven't built up enough fame or wealth to impress a potential suitor before needing to retire.The generations system is neatly done, in that you have a choice about whether to do a big rush of exploration and combat with the current hero, or do you retire early and aim to do better next time. The incentive to retire early is that, the earlier you retire the more boosts your son or daughter start with next time. (For what it's worth, the game is pleasantly gender neutral.)Like many rogue-lites, there is no formal save system as such. Progress is autosaved at the end of each turn and you return to where you left off next time you start the game (select ""load game"" in the main menu).In terms of pacing, the game can hit a dead spot mid-game, where you’ve beefed as much as you’re going to and there is little to do other than random exploring and monster clearing while you wait for building upgrades to unlock (upgrades unlock after a fixed number of generations have passed).I have had a lot of fun with the game so far, and can see myself dipping in and out off and on in the future. Maps re only semi-random, however, so there might not be quite enough variety here to justify repeated play throughs after the game has been ‘beaten’.edit: updated review to reflect improvements from recent patches.

In Hero Generations, each step you take is an entire year of your hero's life. You explore a procedurally generated world in search of fame and a mate to have a child with before you die. After your life ends, you take control of your child in the world you left behind, in the hope of continuing your family legacy. Each turn becomes a meaningful life decision: you can focus on building and crafting the world around you, or adventuring to far off lands to make a bigger name for yourself. - Highly Recommended!

												Entertaining concept; poor execution.Having played a little under an hour, the gameplay already got very repetitive. Combat is completely uninteractive, and amounts to a randomized speed bump either netting you a minor reward or reducing your character's lifespan. The age mechanic (+10 strength, then +10, then -10, then -10, every decade or so) is more annoying than interesting, and diversity between characters is... well, very bland. And playing the game I constantly felt like I was waiting for slow, awkward animations and transitions. There may be real depth here at some point, but not enough to slog through the initial tedium I felt, and certainly not for the $12 it cost on sale.			"

												I'm not impressed, I don't hate it, I have the worst emotion you want a gamer to have.Boredom.I get how it's a roguelike. You have one lineage you try your best with. Fail to generate an heir and you're done for.But why can't I keep on questing while my mate raises my child? Every time you get any sort of stats, you can either retire early and thus lose them again, or keep being useful with a chance of your run failing. How do people even still exist if every couple can only procreate once?Everything seems so inconsequential. I apparently made my home town into a kingdom because I had 12k Fame. I couldn't make it back to my Kingdom, as my time was almost up. When I went to the Kingdom, it was already a Slum. What use is there in generating something fancy if you can't even see it once?But fine, that was because I didn't plan well. I trained far too hard, had about 100 str when I died. I should have gone for 60 str, then go after the 60 str boss. But you have to beat the boss three times! He can easily knock 30 years off of my life! Or 60! Or zero. Like every roguelike, playing high-risk is rewarded, as that is the only way to break highscores after some time. But it's also boring to fail runs in a row.So just plan ahead. Instead of beating the boss, buy high level gear, get a kid at the Fort, inherit good gear, and beat the boss early. Maybe. And if you DO lose too much time, that's it for that run. You won't see a Kingdom.RNG aside, as that is quite inherent to roguelikes, the music is meh and repetitive, and the animations just take so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long. See 10 numbers fly by on the red star dice before saying what our strength rolls are. Show me my damage given/taken, which you already know way ahead, for 2 seconds more. Deal damage for 2 seconds more.It got worse when I got a +0-1 damage bone. Most of the times it didn't even matter, as targets have 5- hp anyway. But you lose 4 seconds more every combat, to see it roll a 0, and to then add 0 to a different number to not change it.SOBOREDAt least you have ""meaningful"" choices when mating. You flip 6 out of 25ish cards to determine your character. But the cards are face down. You see the type(but not strength) of 3ish cards. You don't have 25 choices. You have 4. Which of the 22 random cards you flip is not an option. It's waiting for the numbers to show. This is made worse at the aging Milestones, where you always see 4 blind cards and 1 typed card, flip one of them. This isn't a choice out of 5. It's out of 2.In this way, I'm bored just as with (unpopular opinion ahead) FTL. Sure, you can do stuff, but you don't have real control. If I find a derelict spaceship, the ""don't investigate"" option isn't really an option, I will have just wasted my time on nothing. This is quite the same: you have 20 life left, explore? Well yeah, sitting around is even worse. But if you get back after losing a battle, your mate might suddenly not want to be with you anymore. Ending your run.Such fun.<Praised as ""the offspring of Sid Meier's Civilization, Jason Rohrer's Passage, and The Legend of Zelda.""> If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

												Hero Generations is a beautifully simple but extremely addictive game. It's combination of Rogue-like elements, with a 4X twist make the game easy to learn, but difficult to master. This really is one of those games where only through playing do you actually get a sense of how much it sucks you in.If you'd like to see some gameplay, I covered a beta version a week or two before release.

			Hero Generations is a casual Rogue-Like game with 4X strategy elements, from indie developer studio, Heart Shaped Games.		

You take control of a Hero, with a limited life-span. Every move is one year of your life (and lost battles cost you more). How do you use this time? Do you explore, looking for treasures, wealth and fame? Do you go off in search of monsters to slay? Do you build and improve on the towns to make life a little easier for the next generation? Whatever you decide, you need to find a mate before it's too late, settle down and have a child; a new Hero to continue the adventure.Pre-Release comments:Despite my Steam playtime, I've have put many hours into the various prototype, alpha and beta versions of this game outside of the Steam client.Upon release, the game did not include a full-screen option. However, full-screen has now been added to the options to allow for a HD full screen experience!All I can say is; it's fun, it's simple, it's addictive. Give it a try!			"

												I'd give the game a 2/5 looking at just the gameplay. The game, most noticeably, lacks an apperent save system yet has a load game button; it saves your game if you x out the window. The game world is very tiny which along with the ui gives it the feeling and appearance of a mobile game or a pc game in late alpha or early beta. So for what it is it is an ok game and worth considering if they lower the price, and make the game world bigger.Oh and make the people have normal skin colors instead of grey or green.			"

												Okay, so I see the issues most people have, and I tried it. I knew I wouldn't be playing it long, but it doesn't take long for a person of skill to make everything literally seem pointless.The finding a mate part took a few generations to set up good. I've got 1 town that I breed in. That in itself is a problem, because it's in the starting area. Would it be hard to lock other points in another area? No, I'd just do the same build mechanics that guerentee a mate.Age is a nice concept. You get +10 strength at Adult and Midlife stages, then -10 strength at Old Age and Sage stages. So your old as sin hero is just as strong as your fresh kiddy outta mommy. I get it, but I'm pretty sure a 16 year old could stomp a 120 y/o (My max age when finding a mate) into dust.City building takes a few gens. Get use to it. Build houses right off the bat. Put more people INTO the city, you'll be able to bone one. Got a bad lineup? Go to another city. All else fails, just start over. Every generation is a learning process (until you hit my point).Now, the playthrough I have going now, nothing breaks down. Not because of a building, not because I have traits. I have an emerald hammer, had it since gen 2. 800 years repaired.... Nothing breaks, because I walk over everything every life, have to to get strong enough to kill the bosses. How am I doing that?Turn 2 cities into fotresses, one with STR boost building, one with Damage boost buildings. On a good kid, I can easily take 20 years off other adventurers before even hitting ""adult"" stage.Therein lies the issue. I'm a huge RTS nerd. TBS isn't all that different. So I build to withstand over time. The hammer was a lucky drop, whatever. I still bought it. There's traits to get that effect. The problem is the moving. I don't think it should take 8 years to travel from one city to another. You're sleeping half the time, wake up and move your♥♥♥♥♥ 1 year 1 turn? No. Kill the life boosters so a character can't live 120+ years. I killed 2 bosses in that life. With the frailty this game shows on its ""heros"" that wouldn't work. Problem is, once you figure out how to build, you can get your guy out by midlife and into big fights, smash the enemies, hit sage, return to your breeding towns and just bang a chick to get a kid. Got the Golden Child Trait? Set up to smash a LOT of critters cause you're OP from the start of that gen.So for a couple hours? Sure, waste the time. Got a bad memory? Fog of War killing your vibe? Got a phone? Take a picture every time you fully explore a zone. Why are people hating on this? Take notes, it IS a form of stratagy game.All in all, I'm a harsh critic. I enjoy a challenge, and this game doesn't deliver that past the first 30 minutes (I'm being extremely nice on that) I would have to give this a 4/10. I wouldn't recommend it to my friends, they enjoy the same super insane difficulties I do. It just isn't hard enough long enough and theres no sense of reward for doing anything.And the ""ReGen"" they released? I won't be spending 15 USD to see what they did. Same game from I see. New items? New Traits? That's an update you money grabbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, not a new game. Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥			"

												My Quick Look on Hero Generations:


YouTube™ Video: Phawx Plays Hero Generations - Every Turn Is One Year Of Your Life - Quick Look / Let's Play 

			Views: 716		

			Steam Store Link: http://store.steampowered.com/app/295590/		

The game bills itself as a 4x Strategy Roguelike RPG, with the enticing McGuffin being that each turn is one (1) year of time that has passed. It's an interesting mechanic when applied against average human life expectancy.  There is always an urgency regarding your movement and what you set out to accomplish before going to the nearest town to have your next offspring.  The end goal of the game centers around how much fame (any particular generation) you've attained during their particular life-cycle.  More or less, fame is your score and you're trying to get a high score, which are reflected against a leaderboard on the main menu.These are the basics to the game, which fosters a very tight play-cycle on any particular generation lasting around three (3) minutes on average.  There are methods to increase your life expectancy (which requires either time or luck) but the steady beat of time and unlucky battles widdles away what little life you have.The game is very easy to pick up and learn with only a (optional) five minute tutorial to get you up to speed.  Animations are crude but get the job done.  Scaling up the game window to accommodate your display actually works against the game, especially during the battle sequences which can make the game (visually) seem not fully baked.All told, Hero Generations is like witnessing a machine in action.  All of the cogs and pieces have a purpose and fit together perfectly.  But, at least for me, it never went further than a cold, calculated strategy machine and never really addressed the powerful metaphor of how our short our lives can be.Having said that, it's still a fun game and I enjoyed it.

												Hero Generations is a very fun game to play,  its challenging and full of decision making.   As a player, you must make life decisions for your future generations. It has addictive qualities that keep your interest and thirst for fame, money and the proper choice of a mate.  It's great for all ages.  The artwork and characters are also very intriguing.  I have given Hero Generations a 10 out of 10 rating, meaning, an excellent top quality game.  I want to keep playing it  to see if I can keep improving on my fame, money and mate choices for my future generations.  "

												While I find the description to be wholly inaccurate, it is nothing like Civ this is a great game for jumping in and out of when you have a free 5 or 10 minutes. I only play for short stretches of time so in that respect and at it's £5.50 price it's pretty good value and certainly worth a play. I would suggest you watch some Gameplay videos though as I was not expecting the Gameplay to be like it is.Added Plus judging from the other Reviews the Devs seem to be pretty good at taking players opinions on board.

												I gave this a tentative thumbs up. It is a cute little rogue-like. My problems with the game revolve around pacing and balance. It is so easy to start a new hero and have 10 turns of ""run like a chicken"" because you have 1 strength in the early game and are just biding time till the +10 str at adult. Meanwhile by generation 8, I've ended up with my start world having an infinite life-strength-damage-money loop I can run through until I'm bored of it. Said gen8 hero is currently 5000+ years old with 250+ years remaining, 2600+ strength and 100+ damage.If the developer does some balance passes, I think I could go to thumbs up with no hesitation.I haven't seen the balance passes and have had to change my rating to thumbs down.

												I liked the look of this game when I first saw it, and bought it within half an hour of doing so. Unfortunately I find that it's not a game I'm particularly fond of. I found myself bored within an hour, and unable to find many ways to build a sustainable dynasty, or achieve much at all. At very best I could defeat one easy boss in a lineage, and then once that lineage ends you have to start over in a completely new world, so any progress you managed to make is now gone.I've never been as strategy minded as some in these kinds of games, so I'm sure there are people who would do a much better job of this game than I. Personally, while I love the art, the game was not for me, and isn't one I'd recommend to friends.			"

												Well, with all the updates made, i can say this game is now actually fun for a longer period of time, as well as stable. It's not the best game ever by far, but for it's price class, it's really a good buy, assuming you like strategy games and/or RPG's. I'd be really disappointed if the updates stopped any time soon though, since i can still see a lot of things that could be improved and added upon, to turn this game into the masterpiece i imagined when i first heard of the concept.Originally, i did not recommend anyone to buy this game. I still don't think this game is for everyone, but few games are. I like it, as it is, in it's current state, however, and maybe you'll like playing it too.			"

												---Warning long review incoming---This is based only on a couple of hours in. Oh! My english is not that good, so it's possible you see some mistakes.That said, let's get into the subject. The game has an interesting concept. The mix of ""5 Minutes Civilization"" as the dev said and the ""Rogue-Like"" genre, with the mechanic of mating so you can build a legacy make the whole idea interesting. The devs wanted the game to be accessible to everyone, so the game may be a bit simplistic.What is the result?Well... they managed to do something good, but i'll be honest, it's not the indie game of the month. You start in your village, and go fight monsters, build improvements to nearby towns so when you move on these tiles you get bonus (like more Strength, more Lifespan, Gold, etc.)You get quests as you go to other worlds, and you have a main quest too. So, you have your objectives, now it is up to you to find how you are going to accomplish them.The fact that they made the game accessible to everyone makes the game way too easy for harcore gamers, or some devoted gamers in general. The casual gamer type will find some fun, or even our kids or just new gamers.I don't want to spoil anything because there isn't much to discover in the game and it will destroy ""the magic"" if I tell you everything right now. Let me do a quick Pros/Cons list, so you'll have a better idea about the game.Pros___-Beautifull art-style. Simplistic, but still nice.-Nice music. Yeah... it's good.Now the real stuff-Good mix of genres (Simplistic 4x + Rogue-Like)-Friendly game that anyone can play-Interesting RPG system with the gear limit (2) , the traits you pass down, etcNeutral----Simplistic (i think i said that word a couple times now)-Easy-The art style, depends on your tastesCons----Too easy for the more dedicated gamers (way too easy for hardcores)-Doesn't have much content (not enough gear, traits, worlds, monster types)-Feel sometimes like a pocket game you would play on a phone or tablet-A girl named Bob, a boy named Josephine... -.- Seriously Heart Shaped Games LLC please fix your name generator (sorry for all Female Bob and Male Josephine out there)-Only 1 save slot-A ""Main Menu"" button would be nice by the way-More screen resolutions needed-Fullscreen and Borderless FullScreen is missing-What is this volume setting? It's like my phone. Make a slider or something please.-Fights are ful RNG based (My hero have 40 Str, my oponent 10, I roll a 6 he roll 8, he wins the fight and hit me with 5 damage, so i lose 5 years of my life)-Somehow overpriced (here it's 16,99 CAD$ full price, so i think $14,99 USD. Maybe if it was $9,99 USD (around 11 or 12 CAD), it would be more worth the money.And there is more i'm pretty sure, but i'll stop here because the rest is my personnal opinion, and it doesn't count right now. I heard this somewhere and I can't find who said that, but it's a very good way to think about games. Each dollar spent on a game should be worth one hour of fun. So in this case, the game must give you at least 15h of good time. Well, even if I found the game to be very easy, I still think  I spent some good time on it, because it was a relaxing experience. Sometimes, easy games are fun, even for more hardcore gamers.So, overall, I still recommend this game. But keep in mind that it's a small game for the public. So don't buy it if you want intense combats, deep strategy and complexity. This is really what the devs call it. a ""5 Minutes Civilization"" with Rogue-Like elements.This was Hero Generations.My personnal rating: 7/10Worth buying at: $11.25 USD or less.			"

The gameplay is fun, you have to think- what do I want to do with this life, what stuff should I build for the next generation. But it's not $15 dollars fun, it's like 5 dollar fun.			"
