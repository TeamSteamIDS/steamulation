												Came within 5% of the top-most goal for a level, and failed for lack of time.  Went back several saves and looked at everything.  Was my choice of drug wrong?  Were my production lines a square or two inefficient, preventing me from utilizing another delivery portal?  Was I spending too much on Bolivian Tree Frog Saliva?  Did I not get the researchers working on new machines fast enough?And then it hit me: my best-selling drug, for erectile dysfunction, beautifully crafted to avoid side effects and have an A cure rating... was devastating the market...  for itself.  I simply couldn't pull enough profit out of the economy if I cured people.Tried again.  Made sure to give the sufferers a side-effect free drug which worked... some of the time... enough to get their hopes up... but not enough to stop buying next month's installment.10/10 would abandon business ethics again.

												As a registered pharmacist, I feel that I am uniquely qualified to speak to this game. While it's not like actual pharmaceutical research and development, it does capture the essence of drug development (evaporation, distilling, different excipients) and does it while keeping things interesting. The minute-to-minute small puzzles of configuring everything in a small space, managing price, pushing for the next-best-thing (or not, if it's more profitable to flood the market with cheap, side-effect heavy medications), and monitoring the competition are all pleasingly done. You're allowed to set your own pace and customize your challenge through a wide variety of options, missions, and randomization of ingredients. The UI and graphics all fit well into this process.Thumbs up for this one, one of the better management/puzzle games released recently! "

												If you are the type who keeps working at something until you get it perfect, try this game! If you like games such as the Build-A-Lot, Farm Frenzy and Tycoon simulators, this is for you. It's a bit tricky to wrap your head around to start with, the tutorials teach you the bare basics (there's alot to figure out yourself as you go) and I almost gave up - but it is a puzzle game for a reason! Now I have a handle on the game mechanics, it's so addictive I can't go a day without playing. By far the trickiest part of the game after learning how to make successful drugs, is how to handle loans and income streams. You can't really do much without taking out loans (or at least this is how my gameplay works). I've tried looking for a similar game but haven't been able to find one. I'm hoping they release a similar game before I tire of this one! Getting master on all levels is very difficult, so it should be a while :) Just downloaded the DLC and looking forward to many many more hours of enjoyment. 10/10			"

												I am a big fan of logistic-puzzle games and thought that this might take the gameplay of Spacechem or Factorio in exciting new directions. Unfortunately, the logistics puzzles and business simulation don't really play off of each other well, and the game quickly becomes tedious. The two halves of the game don't play well together. The logistics lines are a little bland and mostly come down to twiddling the concentration of a drug up, then down, then up again to evolve its attributes and get them to the right concentration. This might be more fun if you could go whole-hog laying out a complicated production line, but the business side of things ensure that's generally unprofitable. Everything operates at just a 1:1 or 1:2 ratio, so there's no thrill of big, powerful throughput like you get with a massive Factorio setup or a speedy Spacechem reaction. The business level isn't that interesting, either. Your profit is dependent on the efficiency and margin of your manufacturing lines. Sometimes competitors will interfere by saturating your drug's market, which reduces your profits. Often, a competitor will beeline patent technology just to force you to replace your best drug every other year. That's just annoying. The business layer is also your chief source of waiting, as you twiddle your thumbs waiting for the next ingredient or technology to unlock.The GUI is also a bit of a chore. You'll frequently be flipping back and forth between the ""Ingredients"" and ""Cures"" tabs to try to figure out what steps you need to evolve your drugs, which ingredients provide the desired attributes, and finally what concentration you'll sell it at, and whether competitors are saturating the market.There are some clever things. Sometimes you will sell a drug with a bad side-effect profile just because it's not profitable to sell a more refined form of the drug. Or maybe your drug will be too effective and demand will go down, or maybe your one drug's side effects will drive sales for another drug. These are all twiddly little fringe cases, and they're not cause enough to keep me playing.			"

												This game was a little bit of a surprise..  I don't usually get much into tycoon type games, though I have fond memories of Theme Hospital from a few years back, and I guess Rollercoaster Tycoon, so my experience isn't great to compare this to others in the genre.   That being said, I find this game a great deal of fun.There are two core elements to the game;  a Logistical puzzle, and, a decent strategic/business simulator.  I'll cover these separately.The first part is what you mostly see in the pretty screenshots - you need to construct assembly lines that transform raw biological substances (insect parts, plants, etc) into finished pharmaceuticals.   There are a good number of different medicines you can manufacture and each one has vastly different requirements.  You need to purchase a variety of machines to transform the product as it moves along the belt from the 'in window' to the exit.   Some machines strengthen effects and some dilute them.  Other machines are used to combine two ingredients, to analyze a finished drug, to modify or rearrange effects, and to package the final product.  All of these machines have different 'in' and 'out' slots that will need to be matched up via conveyor belts in the correct order.   At first this can be a little daunting and frustrating, especially when you attempt to 'upgrade' a drug to a more powerful version, and some trial and error is required.   That said, it's great fun once you learn the basics, and quite rewarding when you smooth everything out.The second part of the game is the business sim.  This is probably standard fare for these types of games, but again I'm not experienced enough to provide a good comparison.  In order to succeed you'll need to carefully manage your expenses - buildings and expansions, machines, drug ingredients, research, and exploration all require money, and while you can take out loans, this will quickly sink you if you don't have steady cashflow coming in.   There are competitors who are trying to make a profit as well, and deciding which drugs will provide the best returns can be a challenge.  You must invest time and money into research in order to unlock better machines and make your existing ones more efficient.  You also must send explorers out to discover new substances that can be transformed or combined into new types of drugs.  Random events can have impact on supply and demand as well, so it pays to keep an eye on news popups.There is a good tutorial, which introduces you to game concepts as you play so you don't get overwhelmed.  After that, a series of 'missions' of advancing difficulties keeps the game fresh.   I can't speak to the replayability of the game as I'm nowhere near completing the core missions yet, but I believe there Is a sandbox mode once you've mastered all the basics.  The missions themselves can take from 15 minutes to a couple hours, depending on the difficulty and how focused you are.Big Pharma's art style can be described as cartoony and colorful.  It really reminded me of a less silly version of theme hospital, but aside from the graphics (and upbeat music) there aren't may other similarities between these two games.  One nice feature is the ability to 'paint' your factory - with various primary hues and patterns.  This could be useful to customize different product lines or processes on each line, or just pretty things up to your own tastes.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys casual business sims and puzzles.  Big Pharma succeeds well at both, and I found it well worth the price of 24.99, though I was fortunate enough to get it on sale. "

												Having played this game in (pre-Steam) alpha and beta for over 150 hours I can say ... it's amazing!So, what is it about?- Create a perfect, smooth running production cycle- Are you going for a cheap medication, try to appeal the mass-market, make a quick buck?- Do you want to perfection it, research side-effects, minimize them and improve?- Beat your competition by patenting the big cures? Maybe YOU are the guy curing Ebola, getting rich and famous?- Research new ingredients, new cures, new machines, new developments, new production methods- Send your scouts and scientists on month-long missions to find that rare beetle somewhere in the Arctic ice or learn how to use that new technology you need to unlock a fourth or fifth level of an ingredient.- Expand, start with new ingredients, new cures, do it all over again!It's a sandbox game and feels a lot more like Transport Tycoon or Infinifactory than Theme Hospital, you have your input (a plant, an insect, any kind of biological source), you refine it, mix it, filter it, strengthen or weaken specific effects, create a smooth running cycle with dozens of machines or steps in between, then export it as a medication in various forms. Pills or syringes? All your choice. Then you get rid of the side-effects, mix in other incredients, improve, get your A+ cure out and feel proud!Play with or without competition, maybe you just like to make it look good and not fight with other companies? Your call!If you like games like Infinifactory / SpaceChem or Transport Tycoon you will love this game.If you expect a simulation where small changes can affect the outcome on the long run you will love this game.If you expect the humor of curing patients like you did in Theme Hospital, this game might appeal, but wont fill that need.Overall it's a big recommendation if you like slow moving steady games, it'll often take hours to set things up well-running, and it's all about patience.

												Big Pharma is a ...Well, lets just say it outright, it's not a game about being a large scale megacorporation producing a massive amount of drugs and cornering the market. It's not a simulation of medical pills and pharma companies, and it certainly is not a game about the overall management of such a company or the simulation of such a thing.It makes promises that it can not keep. You will get little strategy, severely abstracted simulation, and very limited management. 'Big Pharma' is not about anything big at all.Instead, it is a small scale game that is essentially a puzzle about optimising chains of machines to produce a desired output, in a randomised building area of random size, with random ingredients that have random effects. If you like that, then good for you. You will probably enjoy this one, but for the rest of us who are after the other 'features' it proclaims to have..The simulation is basic to the point where I wonder if it is a simulation at all. Diseases have a set number of sufferers or a set cycle/increase of sufferers and your management is limited purely to the supply lines, machines, and conveyor belts. Everything else is abstracted to the degree that I wonder why it was even included in the game, and many times adds nothing except a timer you need to wait on before you can continue working your belts.The challenge, and main gameplay is more alike a puzzle.Fit machines in the (random) building you have to have your (random) ingredients produce an optimal effect for maximum profit. Nearly all the gameplay is about optimising your conveyor belts and machines, which will be frustrating to you because the machines come only in one form with 4 facings. You can not make a symmetrical and effective supply line, and conveyors can not go over or under eachother. You get a limited amount of (Randomly placed) input/output areas to connect to, and often you will not have space for just about anything more than a basic machine.Employees never have to walk in, out, or do anything in your building, they are merely an animation that is part of the machine. Research and exploration happens somewhere else. You never see your scientists or explorers except in a menu where you send them out.If this game was only purely the production tab, was honest about its size and content and somewhere between 5-10 dollars, then it would be great. But as it currently stands I just can not reccommend it for its price. The conveyor belt optimising puzzling is nice, and I will likely play it a few more times just for that, but that is all there is to the game. There is no 'improving the lives of millions', there is no 'getting rid of disease', there is no real management or simulation of a 'pharmaceutical conglomerate' here. The challenge scenarios are jokes, the rival corporations are jokes, and the whole 'business sim' part that it talks about in the ""About This Game"" part of the store are jokes.This is a conveyor belts puzzle with shiny graphics, get it for that if it is ever at a 75% or even 50% sale, but as long as it stays above 10 euro/dollar, I recommend avoiding it.

												So I've been playing since the early access non-steam beta came out and I've put about 30 hours into this game before this release and I honestly have to say while I like the idea it has some really bad core problems that all stem from it's use of luck.Basically this is a puzzle game with a enormous amount of randomness thrown into it and those are two things that rarely work well together. The game is more or less about completing scenario's with tiers of set goals and two months ago I made a rather long post on /r/bigpharmagame that explained why it's not done very good well overall.The short version is basically everything you need is random. The amount of space you start to build in is random, the drug effects you start with are random, the effects on those drugs are random, the order you unlock new drugs is random, the products your competitors will make are random. The only non-random things are how much money you start with and your overall goal for the scenario. Which leads to many many MANY unwinnable situations, e.g; It's possible to play a scenario were you have to produce certain medicines within a certain time period and random chance will put the drug you need so far down the research list that there's no possible way to even get to it let alone produce anything with it before the time expires.To put it into something that most people would understand; pretend your playing StarCraft 2 but the amount of SCV's you started with was random, so was the amount of vespene geysers, mineral patches and how much was in them.  With me so far? So YOU might start with 2 SCV's, 4 vespene geysers and 3 mineral patches, while your opponent starts with 10 SCV's, 2 vespene geysers and 20 mineral patches. Now ontop of that also make all the unit costs and research a random number as well. Do you see why this is bad now?It's basically a requirement to restart a scenario over and over again til you get the space and favorable drugs you need if you plan on getting anything but the bronze completion. Even if you get a favorable start, you still might need to end up restarting anyway because you may have had 2 of the drugs you needed for the 3 pills you had to produce but sadly #3 is the very last one your explorers can find.Overall it's what killed the game for me. If there was set drugs with set effects with set starting positions on the board then I wouldn't have had nearly any of the complaints I did. But overall you spend more time restarting then actually playing the game unless your content to bust your♥♥♥♥♥for bronze the whole way through, riding the waves of luck. "

												Interesting - Buy it on saleQuick points are below - full review right here.This game has some addictive qualities and will keep you interested for a time, but overall it lacks the full grasping power of other simulation / business games.  Your competition is supposed to be another company or group of companies, however, as long as you're turning a profit it doesn't really matter.  You are given objectives to meet and once you get the hang of it, they're pretty easy.  Your competition doesn't seem to affect much.  There are more punishing game modes (start with debt, etc) but honestly the reward of ""winning"" isn't enough to even contemplate another run through this game.The biggest adversary in the game is the whole researching and combining platform.  There are maybe 12 things to research, so this has already become exhausting and a chore.  It just has to be done and there is no thought needed.  I've found myself ""waiting"" far too often.  One of the biggest draws for me for business simulations is the complete micro-managing which ensures you always have something to do, that does not apply to this game.There is a puzzle element to this game that I'm not sure it needs.  It's more annoying than anything.  I suppose if you're really into maximizing space you could enjoy it but it's much easier to just buy a few expansion spots and build what you need in an empty space and not worry about it.  I think planning your factory floor would be more enjoyable if the inputs / outputs of your machinery were customizable.  As it stands you have 5 of the same machine on a line all outputting in the same direction and you just get a maze of belts.  It's asthetically unpleasant and tedious.I don't know how many more times I'll play this game.  Maybe a few run throughs here and there.  I've had much more fun with smaller / cheaper sims like Game Dev Tycoon.If / when the workshop comes to this game I think it will be worth a second look.  There are so many aspects of the game that I think the creative minds of the Steam community could expand upon.  As it stands now, its just repetitive and tedious after a few run throughs.Pros+ Minimally addictive / interesting+ A bit challenging at first+ Fun to make medicines (for a bit)+ Compounding meds for the max effect is challenging and rewarding*Cons- Repetitive- Not enough ""research"" and ""exploration / ingredient"" options- Puzzle aspect not needed and detracts- CPU adversary essentially meaningless- *Tarnished by the 12 same machines and room full of belts required to do itNot recommended at current $25.

												Playing Big Pharma and figuring out its intricacies is a lot of fun... at first. The stages and challenges are pretty samey, and the game gets pretty old really fast. If the game cost five bucks, I might have given it a thumbs up recommendation; at its current list price, it's twenty bucks too dear.Big Pharma provides dozens of hours of gameplay... but you'll only really have fun for the first few. If you keep playing past that it'll probably be out of some completionist urge, you'll play well past the point you stopped having fun with it and you'll just end up resenting the game. Once you've figured out how the game works and you find yourself just fulfilling mission objectives, this should signal that the honeymoon period is over and you should put this game down and do something fun instead.If price is no object and you're really drawn in by this game's premise (I was), consider buying this for a couple hours' worth of fun. Otherwise, this is a title you can safely skip.			"

												This is a nice optimization-/economics-game and is definitely good for a few hours of fun.BUT:- Its economic simulation is extremely shallow: no marketing, no manual price adjustment, the AI does not react to overproduction- Its gameplay is completely generic. Swap the sprites and text to something car related and you have ""Big Automobile"". - It is completely lacking one of the key dilemmas of Pharma: Ethics. Do I produce a cure for this widespread illness which won't make a profit or do I maximise profit with expensive drugs and let the population suffer? In this game, you just go for max profit since the population isn't even there except as a drug-to-money converter.Bottom line: Doesn't really pull its weight. Also very overpriced for what it offers.			"

												It's a good game, but I can't give it a positive review.  The concepts are awesome and they're off to a good start, but the gameplay just doesn't deliver enough enjoyment.  The game's systems are very complex, and the main problem the game suffers from is the interface.  The information you need to find out in order to make effective choices is arranged in a very arcane and dispersed fashion.  This leaves you with two choices: 1) Play the entire game alternating between Play and Pause, and spend most of the game looking for information while Paused, or 2) Discover all the information you need AND engage in critical thinking while Playing, at which point, the situation will have changed so much that you need new information and a refinement of your original plan.What this means is, the gameplay just doesn't deliver enough of a hands-on feel so that you feel real control over the game's systems, and over your chosen outcomes.  But it's one of those games that gives you enough tiny little dopamine-buzzers (Dings, music, sounds, green profit text, etc.) to fool you into thinking you're having a good time and keep you hooked.But after you play for 4 hours, you're just left with kind of a ""blah"" feeling.If they made the interface more concrete and less arcane, the game would have a better feel, ie. Player Input -> Logical Outcome.  Then I'd give it a better review.6/10.			"

												When Big Pharma first came out, they made a big deal of how it was going to be this big moral quandery. Would you go the path of greed, sideeffects be damned, or try to alleviate the world's ills for afordable prices. This was the reason I became interested in this game. Now, seemingly, they've fulfilled those promises (but most likely not), in the form of a PAID expansion.What you do get from the base game is a boring puzzle game, where you start from zero at every level, having to do the same things over and over again. There are zero moral quanderies. There is no reason to care about the 1s and 0s on your charts. You aren't presented with any consequenses even if you release the aids virus in pill form (other than a drop in profits). It's ONLY about making profits, nothing else matters gameplay wise.			"

												280 Hours on the game... half which I was probably afk...Where to Start... It's a decent game. The graphics are clean. The user interface is pretty straight forward. It's entertaining. It has a good tutorial. There are a few metrics of the game that are a bit tricky, but once you figure it all out, you can start pumping out money making products in no time. The only real issue i have with the game is it's a bit repetitive after a while. The only real reason I’m still playing it, mainly to finish off the last achievement I need for a perfect game. The grind is always the start of the level. All the challenges with the exception of the full unlock mission, have everything locked up tight. It's a bit annoying to have to go thru the same unlock everything BS each time you start a new level. Other games would let you unlock it, and then allow you to keep it on future missions, not this game.The other real issue with this game is the luck generation. A level is never hard or easy based on your skill or the conditions of the level.... The level is hard or easy based on the ingredients it gives you. If you get great ingredients, you can have a great start and plow through the level pretty easily. If you get♥♥♥♥♥♥ingredients, it’s just a long drag and struggle and you're better off starting over and hoping for a better starting hand. The game's full price is about $30 CDN. I'm notoriously cheap when it comes to buying games, not because I don’t appreciate the cost of development, but because I have about 500 games on my steam account I haven’t touched yet. It makes it harder to buy a new game over playing something I already bought and paid for. The moment I saw Big Pharma, i knew i wanted to buy it, but not at full pop. However, it is currently on sale for $10 CDN. Is it worth that, I would say yes. I figured i got a solid 100 hours of entertainment from this game, so at $0.10 / hour, this game is a great steal at $10. Even if you tried it and found yourself bored after about 20 hours, it's hard to be entertained in this world for $0.50 / hour. Do I recommend it?? I recommend buying this game when it's on sale.I'd give it a solid 7/10 "

												I wanted this game to scratch the same itch as games like Infinifactory and Factorio, but I found the game to be a bit of planning and then a whole lot of waiting around.The goal of maximising your profits meant that I would pause the game as I planned out each build chain, and then when I finally unpaused, all I could do is sit and watch for a long time as either my Scientists or Explorers gathered more progression for me, or I earned enough profit to pause the game and build something else.Also the lack of a planning mode/phase meant that I would waste money after I build most of a production line, only to find out that either I miscalculated or ran out of room. If you place a conveyer it costs you $100, and if you then destroy it you only get $50 back, even if you did it right away! If perhaps the game only charged you upon unpausing the game, then perhaps you could go nuts building everything without fear of going broke due to mistakes.I felt like the random elements in the game did not offer enough variability in how you play the game. It's just a matter of looking at the few incredients you have available via the unnecessarily clunky interface, mixing them in the same ways, and producing a product that you then proceed to forget about because it is time to move on to the next product. Then you run out of sockets and just spend the next 30 minutes watching the timer count down and your bank balance go up.This game simply is not for me. I gave it a fair shot but found myself pushing myself to give it more, in hopes that something would change or get better.			"

												Since 2010 there has been about six or seven playable business management sims. Only two are at the level of fun and playability of Big Pharma. First and foremost, the game manages to somehow make sense when explained as both simple and complex. It takes a very complex concept (manufacture from origin to completion) and makes it manageable from a single manager's perview.The game is both easy to understand and succeed and challenging to master and dominate. I recommend this game as both fun and challenging. It may not have the same level of replayability of a Diablo 2esque game, but with the number of scenarios/challenges built in, it has a few hundred hours easy.Two: Game Dev Tycoon, Tropico 4/5			"

												VERY well made game! I had a sneaky suspician that this was going to be a good game (from what I'd researched prior to its launch), but I was surprised to find that it was much better than I had expected.See the TL;DR read section at bottom if you want just the quick notes.I'm trying to keep the in-depth review as brief as possible, but it's very difficult...there's so much to say about this game.The Good1. GAMEPLAYYou start, grow, and manage a pharmaceutical company. You control every aspect of it such as production lines, research and development, budget (purchases, importing ingredients, payroll, cost of production), meeting market demand, etc. This is a pharmaceutical tycoon game and it gives you plenty of options and features to run the business as you please or win a scenario as you please. Designing the production floor is like a puzzle...but I really hate using that word. It's not a puzzle game. You have to make use of the space you are given (which is a lot so far for me) and plan workflow, but it's much more than that. There are options upon options to consider  The game can be very complex at times, but it also allows the player to keep things simple if they so choose.There are 8 Scenarios with 5 missions each. Some missions are specific, some are rather broad.  There's also a custom game feature and a free build option. Together, they allow the player to really play as they want. You can develop highly sophisticated medications or you can deal with simple production lines. It's entirely up to you!2. THE GAME IS POLISHED!Unlike many indie games, particularly with early access but not exclusive to them, this game is extremely...I mean extremely polished. Everything was very well thought out and organized. Key features were included yet nothing seems to exist that doesn't need to be. ALL the necessary fundamentals you'd expect are here (rare for many games today unfortunately), but many are done exceptionally well and are thus, quite noteworthy. Examples...One of the best tutorials I've ever seen in a game - it comes in the form of sections and are repeatable (for those of us who sometimes take a hiatus from a game then return later but forget some of the key controls/mechanics). There are also more in-depth tutorial videos by the dev for those who prefer some serious explanation as to what is going on (most probably won't need it though). The tutorial not only gives you the basics and walks you through the steps (allowing you to learn by doing vs reading a wall-o-text in game), it gives you game strategies such as using dual pill printing and options for varying concentration effects). A lot of thought went into the tutorial here.Speed controls - should be standard in every game of this sort...but unfortunately many aren't including it. Pause, play, or speed up time here.Ease of controls - you can hold down key to drag belts and it will auto path and connect where you want. Middle mouse copies an existing machine for further placement, double click allows you to move an existing machine, right click sells a machine.Convenient linking from one page or pop up to a RELEVANT page or place in the game (such as a an alert for new ingredient having a link to take you to the Ingredients page for convenience if you so choose)Animations are very well done and relevant to what is happening (fun to watch)Aesthetic customizer - change colors of belts and floors, you can customize your buildings the way you want. Contemporary design - very well done design with the gui and game assets. Details like in-game notices are done very well too (sliding from the side at top of page vs simply popping up in the middle of the page or displaying on the right hand side which is what most games seem to do).Lastly, one of the biggest parts of polish which was noticed...was the lack of any bugs!  I am despearately trying to find some. I know some have to exist. But I so far, have failed to discover any. The game runs smooth and there are no bugs that break immersion or stop gameplay.The dev did what most other devs do not do today it seems...he focused on QUALITY. He put a substantial amount of time into the game PRIOR to released. He focused on giving customers a QUALITY project to enjoy by making sure the details were there but also that the game works as it is supposed to. He demonstrated that he actually cares about his own game, his own work.Novel idea huh? Give the players a quality product they expect to have?3. DEV ACTIVITYFirst of all, this is the work of only 1 developer. He, like most devs used outside sources for assets (graphics, sounds, effects, voice), but 1 guy is the brain behind this game. Very few games can be pulled off successfully by a single dev and this one was.He also is very active in his communication with customers (his own forum, social media, and here at the Steam forums). THE BADI am still struggling to find something. I honestly am. I've not experienced anything negative about this game yet.The only thing I can see wanting to change, is a part in the last tutorial which discusses maximum strength analysis and how to implement it to upgrade a medicine's rating. To me, that's a bit fuzzy. I tried to understand what was being described and how to pull it off, but didn't understand it. That could just be me though. Regardless, it does not prevent the mission from being completed. It just means the user, or me anyway, needs to ask for clarification on the forum.SUMMARY / TL;DRHigh quality game, extremely polished, plenty of options and features, a lot of variation, NO BUGS (so far). This game will probably become one of the standards of quality that gamers will compare other games to (like many compare other ea games to Prison Architect or Kerbel).In a sea of poorly designed games from devs who don't seem to either care about their products or have the knowledge to make them great...and with the current gaming community's frustration level at an all-time high due to the abundance of bad games and ripoffs coming out on Steam...let this game refresh your faith and trust in the industry as it is proof that high quality games CAN be delivered and some devs DO care about their project and their customers.If you enjoy tycoon style games, do yourself a much deserved favor and GET THIS GAME NOW! You will not regret it (especially with Steam's refund policy of course - but you won't need it).			"

Disclaimer: the key was provided to me for reviewingAccording to description, Big Pharma is a game about creating medicine recipes and selling them for profit. But it focuses more on production process then profit. It is safe to say Big Pharma is a game about creating an efficient production line to achieve your (scenario) goal. The game has a tutorial, but instead of (usual) series of interactions, tutorial itself is actually a guide-like-text in “tutorial scenarios”. If player can follow the text, it is quite helping and explains the details to a certain degree. Still, for the first few games, it is highly expected that the player will revisit these tutorials. It is also worth noting that the game expects the player to have “planning skills” because it never mentions how a good/efficient layout should be.In this game, player is given a set of machines, and a number of ingredients. Every ingredient has one curing effect and one to three bad side effects (There are 4 effect slots on each ingredient). Each effect on an ingredient is active on certain “concentration range” and is most effective at a certain concentration. This concentration and activation of effects are the elements that create the base of the game. The player is expected to create a production line using the given machines, to activate the positive effect on an ingredient and create a medicine. Of course, bad side effects are present and are to be avoided. Curing effects on the final medicine increase the value and side effects causes it to lose rating resulting in losing value.Illnesses and cure recipes are known, and when you produce a medicine, more advance version is unlocked, up to level 5 medicines. Although illnesses and cure recipes are known, ingredients are not. For each game, ingredients are randomly generated. Only things consistent among games are that each ingredient having only one curing effect and activation range of effects. From effect combinations to how much those effects change final medicine’s value is random. This increases replayability value. But it is also random for scenarios; therefore it affects the actual difficulty of the scenarios. One time the game may be too challenging and other time, it may be too easy.Another randomly generated content is layout for production buildings. In each map, there are several (depending on the size of the map) partitioned buildings. The player is randomly given a partition at the beginning and buys the rest. The buildings and sockets are premade but layout of the buildings is random. Depending on the layout and starting position, the game may be annoying. Annoyance comes from shape of the buildings or the socket positions/count in a partition. Sockets are the points of entry/exit for the ingredients and medicines, on the walls of the buildings. Although there are at least 2 sockets in almost every partition, it can be more. Starting a partition with 4 sockets enables the player to have two production lines, without the need to but new partitions. Also a bad shaped building may prevent you to complete an advance production line required for the higher level medicines.There are also exploration, research, patenting and “company management”. Research is the common knowledge. Player hires scientists to do research. Research unlocks new machines and some infrastructure projects such as cheaper machine prices or ability of exploring different types of lands. Exploration is the same thing as research but unlocks new ingredients instead. On a normal game, only the most basic machines and only 2 ingredients are available at the start. Rest is unlocked through researching and exploration. That said, researching and exploration are just a tab in the game and not the main focus. Same thing applies for the “company management”. Other than patenting process, company management is just an info tab showing player’s medicines, yearly revenue and profit. Also rivals’ basic info can be seen in company management. There is a research that enables to see detailed info about your rivals but it is pretty much useless. Patenting is what the name suggests. Patenting a medicine prevents the others from selling the same medicine for a limited time. The length of time depends on how much player chooses to spend on the patent.Rivals in the game serve two purposes. One of them is to cause saturation because they use the same ingredient as the player and produce (mostly) the same medicine. This saturation increases the cost of ingredients and lowers the demand for a specific cure effectively lowering value of medicines. The other purpose is to patent medicine preventing the player to sell the same medicine. Of course the player has access to patenting after researching it too. This creates a nice “patent war” situation in the game, but patenting is pretty expensive and mostly not worth it until late game. As with all of the production themed games, most of the time in the game will be spend in paused mode. The player will try to make a good choice of ingredient-medicine pair to avoid side effects. After that, he/she will spend an equal time to position each machine in a way that they will occupy the least space. Since it is the nature of the game it is not a bad thing. Still, it is worth noting that machines can only be rotated in 4 directions and belts (connections between the machines) can’t be multi-layered (although they can be crossed and it mostly works well). These limitations may annoy some people, but also some “puzzle people” may welcome them because it gives the production a puzzle feel.The interface is very well designed and the player is never lost in it. It has a futuristic design and goes well with the game. The sound effects of the game are nice and do not bother the player. But the game is a bit quiet. It needs a few more soundtracks.Finally, a personal note: Everything in the game is sold back at half the original price. Especially at the beginning, you  may struggle with the design and make lots of mistakes. Buying and selling the belts will cause you to lose lots of money. To prevent this, plan and imagine the whole process in your mind, put all the machines first and then put the belts. It is also possible to get the “free belts” mod from the official site.Pros:+ Simplistic: All menus and tabs are cleverly put together in a clear and simple manner.+ Good Formula: Game elements go well together.+ Fluent gameplay: There is nothing to get in the way during interaction with objects and interface.+ Mod Support: It does not support workshop but has a separate mod support.Cons:- Randomization in Campaigns: This results in the campaigns becoming too easy or too hard.- Crammed Buildings: Sometimes building designs are too narrow or weirdly shaped and they do not allow a good production line.- Feels Repetitive: Although some of the content is randomized, after a while, the game feels repetitive due to its focus on production. This may be a deal breaker for some people.Verdict:If you think this game as a production tycoon game -as I did- it is well made (considering this is developed by a one-man-company). Overcoming the challenge to get rid of the bad side effects and creating a high rating medicine gave me enough satisfaction, so I recommend it. But because it focuses on production, it may be insufficient for some people.P.S: As a rule, I won't comment on price tag. Everyone has a different opinion on whether it is worth the price tag or not. So it is up to you to decide.If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator GroupEdit: Fixed some typos "

												I have only played 8 hours of this game so i have not even experienced the entire content the game has to offer but i can say that this game is highly addictive, and highly recommended for all those who are fans of simulation/management games.The aim of the game is to take ingredients and alter them in order to create cures for specific illnesses and then sell them to make money to make more cures etc etc.The game has a very steep learning curve, especially in relation to the later tier drugs that involve mixing. Getting these to work in a fluid manner (maximising profits) is quite challenging and requires a lot of trial and error so i highly recommend after the tutorial loading up the mode which has all the research and drugs unlocked so that you can play around and learn how to create a fluid setup of the machinery and adapt to the different building structures (there are only a few so even though its completely random you will get familiar with each one eventually).I did read alot of reviews before purchasing this game and a few mentioned the randomness of the drugs you recieve at the start of the game and size of the building being annoying/limiting the ability to play the game. However i dont think this is as much of an issue, the game seems fairly balanced and gives you plenty of time to complete scenarios regardless of the spawn. I can see the spawns being an issue if you are an achievment hunter who wants to complete all the levels on master (the time limit is much much less), however this can be worked around if you just restart the mission a few times so in my opinion the randomness is not a big deal for those who read those reviews and got worried that the game is broken.I also especially like the addition of a ""global economy"" aspect in relation to the competing companies whereby you need to ensure that the drugs you make are better than theirs by fine tuning them or you will not sell as many units loosing you money or manufacture ones that the ai have not considered thereby creating your own monopoly of the drug (can also be done by patents).Also a must have are the mods for this game, only ones i have found so far are the ones supplied by the actual Big Pharma website, they are very useful (example free conveyor belts).Overall, great game, very challenging and i can see many hours of my life being eaten by it.

												I love puzzle games, but I'm not afraid to admit when they get to be too much for me. SpaceChem is a perennial favorite of mine that I burned out on way before the end, for example. Big Pharma shares certain similarities with SpaceChem, but with a layer of corporate management on top of the mind-bending puzzles. It's an interesting combination, and also a very exhausting one.You get to be the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, which turns out to be a lot more interior design and number-crunching than the vlogging and buying Wu-Tang albums that I expected. Starting with a small empty room, you import ingredients through hatches in the walls, run them through a gauntlet of machines, and funnel the resulting pills, creams, and tinctures back out for a profit. Each ingredient has positive and negative effects that are activated at different concentrations, so your machines can raise, lower, and rescramble concentrations to make effective medicines.Cramming all the necessary machines and connecting converyor belts into the space you have is your primary concern. You can research and unlock more efficient machines but you're trading space efficiency for higher running costs, which must be weighed against the profit of the drug. These values in turn fluctuate with the cost of ingredients, the market demand for that cure, and any competitor companies in that market. This is the management layer I spoke of and while you can do well enough ignoring price fluctuations, more difficult scenarios and the Master-level goals require you to retool your operation based on the market, especially once patents come into play and companies start locking each other out of producing specific cures.This additional layer of complexity may be unwelcome to those just trying to wrap their brains about their assembly lines. Cures can be upgraded to more valuable remedies by hitting specific concentrations with specific machines. This sometimes requires catalysts mixed in with special machines, which might also require re-arranging your chemical's traits with yet another machine. All of these processes must then be crammed into limited space, and layout mistakes can be costly to undo. An efficient, profitable line is incredibly gratifying to put together, but it can be a difficult road to get there.You'll have over three dozen scenarios to choose from, with goals ranging from make X dollars over Y years to deliver Z quantity of a specific drug. Regardless of your goals, the means will be similar, building assembly lines for simple drugs while you research the ingredients and tools to make more complex ones, and refactoring everything when you start to run out of space. New machines, upgrades, and rules may come into play in later scenarios, but never to particularly dramatic effect. It's one of those games where you really have to love the core gameplay loop because it's not going to deviate much from scenario to scenario.The presentation is perfect for a puzzle game, with clear, colorful, cartoony shapes and pleasing animations for all your machines. I want to give special recognition to the sound effects, which reach Blizzard-levels of polish for how perfect and gratifying they are to hear. Machines make delightful buzzes and clanks, belts whirr along happily, and even the buttons have rich bleeps and bloops to them. It's an excellent concept assembled and presented as well as anyone could expect, so the only question is how long you'll care to stick with it. There's not a lot of variety to building lines or running your company, but if you want to build Rube Goldbergian coveyors and tax your brain in turning a profit, you'll find no end of content to keep you happy.

												On paper running a pharmaceutical company doesn’t sound like the most thrilling concept for a video game but seeing as management simulators have been extremely popular it isn’t actually that surprising that Big Pharma has emerged into the video game market. And thinking about it the pharmaceutical industry is ripe for a video game adaption with the potential for science, money, planning, espionage, innovation and competition to all be combined.Well the first thing to do when approaching Big Pharma is to reign in all those expectations; it’s essentially a logistical puzzle game with some management trimmings. Not that this limitation is a big negative – not everyone wants a hugely detailed simulator – especially me in which case a more accessible effort is very much appreciated. This more casual approach is evident from the start beginning with a basic, uncluttered menu system and continuing with the cute and cartoon-like graphics. Viewed from an isometric perspective the graphics are bright, crisp and attractive to look at, while there’s a basic satisfaction in watching your conveyor belts and various machines chug away.From the start you’re instantly presented with all the levels available for you to choose from. It’s a refreshing approach and means you can always change things up if you get stuck or bored, although you’ll want to try and do them generally in order. New players in particular will need to start with the tutorial levels which teach you the basics of the game – this starts off a bit overwhelming as you learn turning ingredients into working drugs, creams or pills through the use of various machines on your factory floor and trying to balance the benefits and side effects of your creations. The tutorials are well designed in this respect but unfortunately you’ll end up seeing a lot of them as Big Pharma doesn’t have a proper manual to refer to when playing.Once you get the hang of the game however it’s very enjoyable and I was getting that essential gratifying feeling from completing my objectives in each level. However the various scenarios that you encounter soon become a bit repetitive and once you’re competent the challenge tails away pretty quickly. In fact the biggest challenge actually ends up being planning where to place machines and conveyor belts within the restricted confines of your factory floor and dealing with the frustrating penalties when having to discard and rebuild them, which isn’t really the point of the game,It’s also disappointing that the management side of Big Pharma is underdeveloped with some rudimentary use of scientists and engineers. Similarly the ruthless nature of the industry isn’t really embraced fully. Sure it’s sometimes better to release a cheap product with side-effects rather than producing something perfect,  manipulate supply and demand to increase your own profits or acquire patents to mess with your competitors, but it never feels like it goes far enough. And as a final minor negative the music is very forgettable, although the various sound effects are fairly decent.I don’t mean to undersell Big Pharma as I did enjoy my time playing it – there’s a pleasant satisfaction to building up your factory and slowly perfecting your latest wonder-drug (before giving it a deliberately silly name) but I was always faintly aware there wasn’t too much else to look forward to in the game. The free play mode does add an extra dimension to gameplay and casual puzzle fans will find a lot to like here, but anyone looking for a real challenge or a more in-depth addition to the genre is likely to be left unfulfilled.

												One of the best management simulators to come along in ages and ages.There's a lot of complexity here and there's a bit of a learning curve, but the tutorial covers the bulk of what you need to know. Unfortunately, the format of the tutorial feels pretty lazy to me and it suffers for that. Namely, it's rendered almost as an in-game manual. The game really needed an overlay-style tutorial rather than ""OK, now click this widget, whose location on screen we will now describe in words instead of just pointing at it."" But that's seriously the only criticism of this game I've got and it's easily fixable if the developers wanted to put some time in on it. It's also an issue that you'll quickly forget about once you start getting the hang of things.So basically, your job is to make drugs. Drugs need to cure things. Ideally with as few side-effects as possible. But critically, you need your drugs to be profitable. Everything you do to remove side-effects or analyze the ideal mixture and concentrations for your drug ingredients introduces processing costs, which lowers your profitability. Meanwhile your competitors are making drugs that may target the same conditions. If their drug has fewer side-effects, demand for your drug will drop, and with it, the price you can charge for it. Suddenly you have to go back and do all the work you maybe skipped in the interests of profits because your terrible drug was properly recognized in the market as terrible. Unless of course, you patent your drug. Competition sucks. Nobody wants competition.You also have some interesting processing challenges around parallelizing the right parts of your pipeline while working within spacing and arrangement constraints. Actually, that's pretty much the core of the game. It's probably one-third budget management and two-thirds arrangement puzzle game that heavily informs the budget management aspect (bad arrangements are unprofitable).I'll be playing this one for quite awhile.Honestly, I could also see this game as being quite workable in a multiplayer format and I think multiplayer might be pretty fun. Since the game is moddable, it might even be possible for the community to supply that functionality. Who knows?			"

												So I have played since early beta (note Beta was _not_ on steam so hours will look off) and have spent many of hours optimizing production lines and maxing out my profits, above and beyond what steam says.My fav elements:- Puzzle aspect is there but doesn't feel forced- Good replay ability (many aspects of the game are randomized)- Reminds me a bunch of a good tycoon type game (by sense of humor/viewpoint and way you are making cash)-- In particular... if you enjoyed Rollercoaster Tycoon, and building Rollercoasters this game is for you... (similarly if you are the type that just enjoyed plopping any old coaster down this game is probably not as much for you)- Developer has been very hands on fixing bugs/making tweaks based on feedbackNegative:- Strategy wise many of the levels make me feel I'm re-using the same methodology over and over again - hasn't hindered my love of the game, but since the ""characters"" running your company have no abilities I find my first 15min of any game feel like the same and it takes till a bit more tech is researched before the game really starts to provide variety (you can fix this by doing quick starts, but wish wasn't required)- Very easy to forget you just played for many many hours and you really should sleep			"

												This game does everything right.It's an easy puzzle game wrapped into a good, challenging and fun manager game. It's charms and graphics are heavily leaning on THE definitive medical game of all times - Peter Molyneux's Theme Hospital.So it has the looks, it has some of the charm, it has the management down and once you play a couple of games you will find that the AI scenarios (it comes with like 50 scenarios and also a very detailed custom scenario editor with import/export functionality) are a shark tank of competition, that reacts to your productions, aggressively researches and uses patents to shut down your profitable products etc.The research is great. I can have fun and build a working company on any tech level, but I really want all of the technologies and cool gadgets as soon as I can get'em. The same thing happens with ingredients. You get the lore of sending some great explorer out into the wild, when in reality you are getting steady supply create relations with your impport seller to further be able to renegotiate prices in our favor. Their outfits don't reflect that mission, hehe.The game is somewhat easy to learn. The tutorials should be played before going on to  other scenarios, or else you wouldn't know what you were doing. Once you do know though, the puzzle aspect of the game becomes even more intriguing than the eco manager for which you took it at the time of purchase.TL:DR;Get this game. Cute looking hard to master fun puzzler wrapped into a brutal economy managing game.Are you going to cure a disease and destroy your own market for the medicine? Because that's part of the simulation, too.This game does EVERYTHING right. It's addictive fun with high replayability and hard challenges.			"

												As a fan of games like Spacechem, the old Mysts and 7th Guest, TIS-100 even and pretty much any other that requires heavy thinking, I really don't get why there are ""so many"" (22% as of now) bad reviews about this game.Big Pharma is not as hard on your brain as some of these games I mentioned above but it does require a fair amount of thought and planning, specially at the begining when you're not used to it, and the hardest levels are also pretty challenging.Put simply (if you're not in the mood for reading everything): the game is good, it keeps you entertained and focused for plenty of time.People writing bad reviews mostly claim that:1 - The game gets repetitive/boring - I disagree. Well, ok, every game gets repetitive - even life itself does - and Big Pharma is no exception. Still, you always get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you see your production lines running efficiently, your drugs selling more than your competitors (and for a higher price) and when you get good trial reviews because you're a good man and ran the extra mile to make them patient-friendly. Also, every level has a different objective, and you can get a standard, expert or master ""score"" on each, depending on how fast (usually) you achieved your objective, and that keeps you on your toe every time, avoiding any mistakes to get your ""master"" rank in every level. You do, indeed, start every single level with the same formula (slight variations, but the same routine), but I find the game is still fun after 20+ hours playing it, mainly because achieving the master rank in the toughest levels is a good challenge.2 - The ""managing aspect"" isn't a big part of the game - Again, I disagree. You absolutely need the money aspect, and it fits the game perfectly in my opinion. You must keep your drugs (and their sales rating, if you have the DLC, which I recommend) profitable, your income on the green, to be able to keep going. You must beat your competitors (and fast) or they'll end up showering you with patents and taking a huge share of the market, diminishing your sales. You gotta be careful with the loans you get so their interest don't end up eating all of of your profits, and also balance how many explorers/scientists you have - and what they are currently working on - to keep enough cash flowing in and your company, again, ahead of the competition. In my opinion, the management aspect works perfectly with the puzzle/logistic facet of Big Pharma. It's a double-fun experience, specially if you're the type of person who enjoys both things.I think that covers most of the ""thumbs down"" this game has received.***About the DLC:If you liked the base game, you'll like the DLC. It adds some neat new features (check the DLC's steam page for specifics.)***On a serious note / Something special about this game:There's a very interesting and particular side to Big Pharma: it opens your eyes for how the REAL ""Big Pharma Industry"" works, or at the very least it makes you think about it.In this game, you can leave side-effects on drugs on purpose (and regulate their, as well as the cure's, strenght as you will) to keep demand for some of your other drugs (those that treat such side effects) up high. You can patent your drugs to get a temporary monopoly of a market's share and raise your prices up to the sky. With the DLC, you can run trials on your drugs and deliberately disqualify the bad results to trick the consumers and raise  your sales. You... see where I'm going with this.After playing this game, one must wonder: ""Dude... this can totally be done for real. Maybe real companies do this kind of stuff."" Then you keep thinking about it and... ""Why wouldn't they? Well... maybe they have principles, and goodness in their heart. Maybe they want to help people."" But wait... we're talking about some of the (if not THE) richest people in the world, people you never heard about, people whose names no one knows. People who torture lab animals on a daily basis, who tested prototype-drugs on jew prisoners during Hitler's Reich. People who profit from the suffering of the sick and weakened, and make a living extorting the dying. People who steal an old guy's economies dry under false promises of an unlikely cure (**Google ""cancer"" here**).Finally, you'll find yourself concluding: ""Man... screw polititians, mexican cartels, weapon dealers and african warlords. Big Pharma - that's the real nemesis of mankind.""I just read that Johnson & Johnson was just condemned to pay and indemnification of 55 million dolars to a woman because one of their talc powders gave her cancer. The doctors had to remove her ovary, and it was literally lined with talc. And that's a second (at least) for them because, months ago, they had to pay 72 million to another woman for the same reason.If this example and reason alone aren't enough for you, Google ""Big Pharma"" or any company's specific name (Johnson & Jhonson, Pfizer, etc.) and read for yourself.What I know is I'm never taking any medicine again unless it's strictly necessary (AKA I'm in heavy, constant pain). If you keep thinking about all this stuff, it's easy to see how far these companies can/could/do go to take your money (like an infinite chain of side-effects and their temporary-with-more-side-effects treatments). Seriously, we are on the ""genetic mapping age"", how hard can it be for trillionaires (the Big Pharma industry generates a trillion dolars per year) to cut off side effects and balance a drug's components if they want to? Damn, even I can do it, according to Big Pharma (the game).***Conclusion:Big Pharma is a very nice game. It gives you a sense of reward every time you score a ""master"" on the tough levels and that's the raw thing every game aims for. If you like puzzle/management games, I'd say this one should keep the average guy entertained for 30-40 hours, maybe more (it took me 70 hours just to get ""Master"" on all the levels in ""Advanced"" and beyond). That's good value for your money, and this is the kind of game that you start playing at 6pm, play for one or two hours straight, quit, and realizes it's already 11pm.If you're concerned about the negative reviews (I always and seriously take them into account myself), maybe you can wait for a sale, but I really don't think you'll regret your purchase at full price, as long as you understand what the game is like (the screenshots alone can give you a fair idea) and feel you are going to enjoy it - the game's execution itself is great, that is not going to disappoint you.EDIT: btw, I never got a single bug or crash whatsoever.EDIT 2: ok, now the game has crashed once, after 45 hours or so.EDIT 3: I just found out that this game was made by ONE dude, alone. That always baffles me (Terraria was also made by a single guy, if I'm not mistaken). I, myself, can barely get dressed on my own, so... congratulations Tim, amazing job.			"

												Repetitive. Boring. Follow the formula presented to you by the machines and do not deviate from it... no actual choices to be made in this game. Why would anyone find this fun? I love tycoon games, I usually play them for long enough to beat them but this is just a game with no heart or soul in it. This is far too linear to be a tycoon style game.- This is my opinion, if you do not like it, too bad. Any fanboy replies will be deleted. "

												I would be wary of reviewers that invest 5 hours or less into this game. The Advanced Mode's machines, along with the Centrifuge from Intermediate, radically increase the ways in which you can manipulate ingredients. It's also much harder to make and maintain a large profit, especially since competitors play a much greater role in the Advanced Mode. You'll need to start utilizing some hidden optimization tricks involving things like the packer or crossing belts with machines that have a cycle time greater than 1. So while dead-simple machine placement will get you through the Beginner and some of the Intermediate Scenarios, reaching Master in the Advanced Scenarios requires a lot more thought.The negative reviews for this game have some merit, but the game doesn't promise anything more than it delivers. What this game does, it does very well: designing and optimizing production lines, anticipating what the market for a drug will bear, deciding what ingredients and machines to research or upgrade, all while balancing a budget that is very tight early and expands greatly over time. It's a beautifully-animated game that presents a relaxed puzzle atmosphere and gives you almost all of the information you'll need up-front.Let's get some things out of the way, though. Sick people are abstractions, which is honestly what I'd expect from most Pharmaceutical companies. The larger the market for a cure, the greater the relative price and the more of that cure you can produce without tanking the price. The market can increase or decrease as a result of random world events, increase naturally over time for infectious diseases, and decrease as people are cured. A cure that's particularly potent will fetch a much higher price, but you may eventually be left without a viable market for that product.The available cures and how they're upgraded are static. The starting concentration of an ingredient has a fairly narrow range based on the range of the Level 1 cure. The number of plots available for purchase, and the sockets within each building layout, are predetermined. On the other hand...The ingredient order is random, side effects are assigned semi-randomly, the building layouts you get are random, and the market for each cure is random within a small range. This can make or break the profitability of several cures, but the Level 1 cure of every starting ingredient is profitable and smart research choices can dig you out of some terrible early setups. Even a terrible cure can fetch a profit, although it can be much lower than you'd get from a perfect cure.Anyone who says that the Competitors are pointless was playing on one of the easier difficulties. The competition presents a real challenge in Advanced Mode, as you have 3 competitors that all have the same early options that you do. Different AI companies prioritize different things, but they'll usually go for the more profitable cures and cures that can fetch high ratings (ie, no side effects). You have to be smart with your market choices in Advanced because the AI will very quickly oversaturate and tank the price for several cures. Anticipating what your competition will do is a big factor in your success. Patents in particular can really help you or really screw you over in the short-term, although they're fairly easy to work around, but you can do the same thing to the AI. Mucking with the AI's profit margins can really slow them down, giving you a chance to reach (and patent) the very high-level cures before they get a chance to ruin your market.Sometimes you can make just plain bad choices, but usually there's okay options and really great options. There's almost always something you can optimize more if you put thought into it, and if you're shooting for a certain level of revenue or profit you'll be shifting around production lines a lot. I used to hit patches where I'd just need to wait, but now patch 1.01 added a much-needed 5x speed option!Personally, I love this game. The progression has a level of predictability that may put some people off, but the random elements that people keep complaining about actually keep things fresh.			"

												I was worried that Big Pharma could turn out to be either too ""casual"" (like many cheap ""tycoon"" clickers), or too messy (like games that pretend to be serious, but just throw a bunch of random events at you at increasing pace - Theme Hospital, I'm looking at you). Luckily, that's not the case.   There's far enough depth to raise the game well over the ""casual"" category. At the same time, its elements are completely transparent, so it doesn't overwhelm you with complexity. It could rather overwhelm you with opportunities. If you enjoy putting your brain to some work, this is a game a doctor would prescribe. Shortly, it perfectly touches the same strings that was touched by good old tycoons you are fond of, adds a surprisingly relevant puzzle element, and flavors the mix with good city sim's spirit of careful planning & continuous improvement. For details, look below.PART 1. MAKING DRUGS   Your goal is to create medicines and make money of them. A complex, profitable medicine usually consists of several components. Making such medicine usually takes many steps: starting an initial mix from a single ingredient and processing the mix through the chain of machinery, changing its concentration and adding other components (in specific order and specific concentrations). Each ingredient has some positive and negative effects. Effects are not just simple ""+"" or ""-"": during different processing, each effect could become stronger or weaker, or changed to another, or be removed at all. A mix of several ingredients, as you can guess, is even more complex and could end as many various intricate compounds.    So, making your products is not a straightforward task: there are many methods to make different pills for the very same illness, with various effectivity and side effects. Every production step costs money, so your new creations are usually a compromise between love for humanity and love for money. Plus, when you carefully planned all processing steps and finished your future production line design, you need to fit it into your precious factory space (which is sometimes a puzzle itself).    Plus, you start with a limited set of ingredients and the most primitive machines, so your first drugs are cheap and will not provide for too long. To advance into new delicious markets, you need to jump quickly into expensive research, which cripples your feeble cash flow. And when each of yourr products finally comes to market, there's another story to tell....PART 2. MAKING MONEY    You can estimate the market size and common price level of drugs for specific ilnesses. So, you can estimate your profits and risks of entering chosen markets, and pick out the best opportunity. You carefully look for needed ingredients and improve your technologies to make the product with minimal cost. Better quality can get you a hefty price bonus. But your product is not evaluated instantly. Only real applications show how good your creation turned out to be. So, only after time, statistics shows how effective the drug is, and how many side effects it caused. The price can fall dramatically if the medicine performs poorly, or causes far too many unpleasant experiences. Wrong formula? Your problem. Does demand for raw materials drive their prices up? Your problem. And don't forget you're not alone here. If your competitors saturate the same market with their products, and prices go down, guess what? You got it. Your problem.   What's better: to reach after the tastiest pie with a risk that, in a year, every company will also be biting it? Or to look for stable but safe haven in a sector no one is looking at? To rush into selling an untested formula on industrial scale to make some quick money? Or to test all effects in detail and get the best product and ideal production line that will feed you for years? To flood the competitor's market with cheap alternatives to cut its profits (cause I can, baby)?  Or to use the same precious factory space for a new experimental drug? Your choice, and... yeah, your problem.    ""5 hours of gameplay"" reviewers usually stop at, or even before, this point. People with more patience realize, unexpectedly, that Easy scenarios pack is a well-hidden tutorial extension, and that single ""competitor"" actually was a yawning guide in disguise.PART 3. MAKING ENEMIES   When you move to second scenarios pack, dusty gnomes inside your PC are finally convinced that you got used to the rules, and things start to get serious.     The whole new dimension of opportunities: research tree is exploded twice. Equipment which no one has shown you before. New level of formulas you can't even imagine creating without a pen and a paper. Vast number of ways to go. Tremendous amount of things to look into.    The whole new level of warfare: margins are thinner. Side effects' combinations are more sophisticated and widespread. Rivals that, you know, look smart, have different characters and can painfully stab you (and each other) in the back. Wow, now I can patent drugs! What, now THEY can patent drugs?!    All news are a news from a battlefront. Every day is an exhausting race for future riches and fierce dogfight for scarce resources of today. So, do you enjoy to put your brain to some work? Say again? Sorry, wasn't listening. It's all about stress. Got problems with my Prozac production. The composition is a joke. So, what were you saying?			"

												Big Pharma is a management/strategy/puzzle game where you have to build and manage a medicine company. You can say it’s a business simulation puzzle tycoon. You build, research, develop new medicine all the while trying to maximize profits. There is one part of the game that focuses on the production aspect of the medicines, in this part you have to concentrate on researching new medicine/cures and try to improve your medicine overall. The second part of the game is the economics of your company. You basically have to earn profit and try to improve medicine. Graphics: The graphics are simple yet beautiful looking. The colors are very bright and eye-catching. It almost sort of has that cartoon look. There’s not many options in the graphics menu other than resolution adjustment.  Sound: The music in the game is okay, you won’t get bored from it but it’s nothing to write home about as well. The announcer voice can sometimes become annoying though. Other than that most of the sounds work as they should and not bad at all. Gameplay:  The majority of the game is based on missions, where you start out with $50000 and you have a task. For example the first mission has you earn a certain amount of revenue in 10 years. Most of the missions are like that and as you keep doing missions the next batch of missions gets harder and harder. There’s a lot of missions and even free mode where you can just play without having to worry about anything. There will be a rival company which also influences your company when they introduce new drugs etc. There’s also a puzzle element of fitting your medicine making machinery in a limited space, so figuring that out can be a lot of fun. You can choose from 8 different characters when you start a game. There are perks when you start a new game. E.G a perk where refunding equipment gives you 100% money back instead of regular 50%. You can choose 2 perks, at the beginning there’s only 4 perks unlocked but you can unlock more as you do missions and do the objectives the said perk requires. It’s a very strategic game where everything you do has an effect eventually so you must make your decisions well thought out. Game can be pretty complicated so if you like serious management games, this game is for you.The DLC “Marketing and Malpractice” adds a whole bunch of add-ons to the game such as marketing tools where you can adjust your prices of your drugs as per the demand/demand, you basic economics. This basically changes they way the game works with your competitors as you can undercut their prices. You can give “gifts” and other such to doctors to increase sales. The DLC in my opinion makes the game much more interesting and gives it that new perspective of playing.  Graphics: 8/10  Sound: 7/10  Gameplay: 8/10  Overall: 8/10  Conclusion: Big Pharma is an excellent time waster and a very good business/tycoon/simulator/puzzle game. Though prepare to spend plenty of time learning the ins and outs of the game as it can get very complicated. All in all it’s a fun title and the DLC is pretty nice as well.			"

												I played dozens of hours of this game while it was in development and it's been one of my favorite games of the year! I'm happy to see it's now on Steam!Big Pharma is a very unique game. It's best described as a tycoon/management game, mixed with a logistics puzzler or ""product chain"" puzzler, such as SpaceChem, Infinifactory, or Factorio. Your goal is to create and sell cures ranging from cough suppressants to cancer medicine. The creation process is done through a network of machines and conveyor belts that tinker and transform the potency of raw ingredients into the desired cures (often combating undesired side effects).Often just figuring out how to make a good product is an excellent puzzle in itself, but it's made even more challenging by the ability to perfect the potency of a drug, mix multiple beneficial effects, and remove unwanted side effects. On top of that is a whole financial layer, including an ever-changing market of supply (how much raw ingredients cost) and demand (how badly a cure is needed), further complicated by the competition of rival companies who can drive up ingredient costs, compete for similar cures, and even try to patent certain drugs to prevent others from selling them temporarily. All this is mixed with a large research tree and an interesting procedurally generated list of unlockable ingredients that need to be researched and experimented with in order to advance your company.Sound complex? It is! This game is not a casual experience. As a management game, it strives to be more similar to older ""Tycoon"" games of the 90's and early 2000's, where succeeding financially is a genuine challenge and there's very little hand-holding when it comes to how to get there. At the same time, the game is definitely in the same vein of puzzle games like the aforementioned SpaceChem; a production puzzle game with no single ""right"" answers, but millions of wrong ones. Arranging the differently shaped machines and placing conveyor belts is as tricky as trying to figure out the correct combination to make the desired product. But, like the best  of both of those genres, as hard as they are, Big Pharma is actually very easy to learn once you wrap your head around its new ideas, and the payoff is countless ultra-satisfying ""I'm a freakin' genius!"" moments. The most important thing to note? The tutorial is NOT optional for a new player, and since it's a bit of a wall of text, I imagine that might put some people off.In terms of aesthetic, I absolutely adore the game. The music is absolutely perfect for the subject matter, the UI is one of the cleanest and most functional I've ever seen, and like most good factory-themed games, seeing your products  move down conveyor belts and through wacky machines en mass is an absolute delight.My only worry with the game at the time of writing is that it might have released just slightly too early. For the most part it's fully functional, but there are still a few bugs here and there, and it felt like the balance of things like competitor productivity and patents were still trying to be worked out when the game was released. So far, I've found nothing remotely game-breaking and it's definitely more functional than many things released on Steam, but I'm sure it still could use a few patches (there's also whispers of modding support that might expand the game in the future).Overall, Big Pharma is definitely my kind of game. I'd say it's a must-buy for anyone who likes production puzzlers like SpaceChem or Infinifactory, and a good buy for those who have fond memories of old Tycoon games (with a thematic boost to anyone who loved the game Theme Hospital). Those who want a more casual experience may want to look for something simpler, but for anyone for a great brain-straining puzzle and interesting management game, Big Pharma has your cure!tl;dr+ Great open-ended logistic puzzle gameplay+ Lots of depth, with a good tech tree, many machines, and tons of cures and side effects+ Procedurally generated factory layouts and randomized ingredients make each game feel unique+ Great music and lighthearted aesthetic+ Very challenging with many different ways to succeed+ Interesting business simulation with fluctuating markets and competing companies, adds a new layer to the financial aspect of the game.- Complexity may be off-putting; tutorial NOT optional- Minor bugs, might still need a few balancing tweaks "

												Big Pharma is a surprisingly entertaining little game with some great puzzle elements and an enjoyable biz sim. Here are my pros and cons.Pros:1. Enjoyable puzzle mechanic that makes creating new drugs addictive.2. Impressivle large list of items to research and drugs to create.3. Enojoyable and simple UI that is very sleek and well designedCons1. Game sondtrack isnt varied and it can get annoying listening to the same couple of tunes over and over2. The game lacks alot of options and stats that you would really wanna see and would vastly help you get more info about your income and costs, but the new DLC really takes great strides to improve this area so I would highly recommend getting the DLC.3. While I personally think the price is acceptable I defiantely feel that for pure amount of content it is slightly above where it shold be listed, 15 or 20 sound more reasonable. (Get it on sale and it will be well worth it.)In general the game is awesome and if you're any fan of company simulations or medical sims youll love this game. The team seems so far to be doing a great job, they are consistantly updating the game and using to dlc to add some real needed mechanics that make the game far more enjoyable and give it more depth. Im excited to see what DLC they'll be offering next. The game has so much potential for even greater growth with dlc and im excited to see where it leads.			"

												Played about 60 hours worth of the game so far, and have enjoyed it.  I have compeleted most of the missions offered in the game and have dabbled in the free-play/custom game mode.Big Pharma is essentially a one part puzzle - one part economic/business simulator, as most of my fellow recommenders have already mentioned.  As it is a two part game, both aspects of it become important at different times. Early game, the business aspect I feel is the more forefront of the two. Money is tight, and the AI at times can be brutal competitors either flooding the market for a product or squeezing you out of one. Not to say the game is too difficult, but for those who love business simulations, the early game is your niche.  Late game however, the game gives way to its puzzle aspect as the more pressing of the two. You both lose opportunities to flex your capital might as well as simply run out of space to place your production lines, usually resulting in having to forgo certain markets alltogether just to produce a high tier product. And one that is impossible to optimize at that. Some of the late game markets are quirky too  I feel - The Male Contraception treatments are apparently permanent (in any form, but pill form specifically just boggles my mind). For those who love business simulations though, I'd recommend giving the game a go.  Its drawbacks to me are more quirky than actual problems with the game itself and you can get decent value from the game at its listed price. In addition, I tink Mark Allsworth did a decent job with the games soundtrack.			"

												I found this game lacking the depth of other similar titles (Space Chem and Theme Hospital). You have research and ingredients which both require research, money and a person, that takes time so you need to pre plan your way through the research tree depending on the scenario etc.  There are lots of scenarios, I finished the tutorial and played a bit then put this down because theres nothing random about this game, that means theres always going to be a 100% correct way to finish a scenario which for me subtracts from the depth.  In the end for me it just become a place correct machines, maximise profits and select the correct research game, very limited, if your cool with that - fine, if not then I cant recommend this game.

												If you don't like stat screens, tweaking the minutiae, pressing the pause button, or obsessively chasing optimisation then you won't like this game.Nor will you like it if you're expecting a game of logic puzzles; this isn't a pharmceutical version of Infinifactory.And if you're hoping for subplot and intrigue you will definitely be disappointed.So all very negative so far, but if you do enjoy details, planning on bits of paper, or are a slave to getting the shortest/neatest/most profitable solution then this game is for you.In short, this is a relatively simple game for min-maxers who would find it very entertaining.

												Firstly, this is a bit of a mixed review. I was torn whether or not to give a thums up or thumbs down. Ultimately I went with my gut feeling...Overall this game does what it sets out to do. It is polished, has no bugs that I've run into, and has a good solid ui. So why the thumb down?Basically, as a puzzle game this is a fine game. It combines elements of marketing and math together with problem solving. Did I personally find it fun? Not really, though I'm sure this ticks the box for a lot of you out there. I was expecting a game of resource management (space, cash and materials) whilst competing against the AI in a race to find cures and market them efficiently and grow a company. I suppose I went into the purchase wanting a little more Tycoon/simulation based playstyle, what I bought instead is essentially a ""Spacechem"" type genre of a game. It just isn't for me. Regarding price. Even if I don't particularly connect with the game type I respect the dev for making such a polished product. They deserve the money spent for the hours it will have taken to produce and publish their work. No complaints there from me, power to them!			"

												Big Pharma is a combination of tycoon sim, Tetris, and puzzle game.The tycoon sim part is basic; you try to make sure your profits are higher than your expenses, you take out a loan if you're low on cash, you supply more of the drugs that are high in demand, and so on. The simple business management aspect suits the game well.The Tetris part comes from the unique shape of the machines you place in your factory lines and the limited space in which you have to use. In the early game your available space is small, in the late game your factory lines are complex and long, and in both cases maximizing the use of space for optimal output is important. The puzzle part is the meatiest: drug ingredients have components (with negative or positive effects) which can be removed, upgraded, or swapped around using one of your machines. These all have active ranges that vary, and it takes a bit of mental arithmetic to find the sweet spots to create the drug of your choice.When creating drugs, all three parts of the game come into play, making Big Pharma a game with depth and replayability. The campaign missions start you off in an empty factory, which makes gameplay fairly repetitive (though getting randomly generated ingredients and starting ingredients mitigates this somewhat). If you don't mind starting from the beginning for every campaign mission and you're a fan of business sims and casual puzzle games, this could be a good fit.			"

Posted: September 7, 2015
												Big Pharma...I need to say two things about the game at the start:1. The game is REALLY good, if you like repetitive puzzles with some niche changes over the cause of alot of different challenges pre-set by the game. It also has some sort of custom games mode - I have not touched on it so there might even be infinite amount of games you can play.2. The game itself doesn't try to make you interested in playing more of it. It is a game that you pick up and play and then put down again - it doesn't have a character to it that makes every drug/medicine you make unique in its own flavour. You basically just try to figure out how many positive things you can put on a single thing and sell it.Do I recommend the game? No. The game has an artificial longevity that is repeated in the same pattern over and over and over again. There simply is nothing 'unique' about each challenge you do since you will still build the same machines in every playthru' even if in different ways and shapes - they are still the same.Same thing with the drugs... you need to compete against a competitor's painkillers? Then here's your one ingredience with a side effect - now make it good. Rince and repeat.The game has replayability in the fact that all of the side effects and beneficial effects are random to some degree but like I said before, you are still building the same machines over and over again. Nothing happens except your own ♥♥♥♥-ups which some people find intriguing and I do too... in competitive games, not in games that makes me want to think and figure out what to do next.And this game doesn't really do anything to try and challenge you - there are some mechanics like patents which can make you lock out your competitor's drugs for some time and they can do the same to you but, mechanics like those are just infurating when dealing with an AI where as these mechanics have a place in games when you are able to screw over one of your friends; you are able to get a reaction from them.Overall the game is brilliantly made but doesn't do a whole lot with it. I bought it for 18,39€ where as I think the game's value would be around 9,99€ to 12,99€ - consider it when its on a sale but AVOID IT AT FULL OR NEAR FULL PRICE!			"

												Choosing to recommend this game or not was kind of a dilemma to me. I ended up giving it a positive recommendation, but I'd like to show the pro's and cons so you can weigh it for yourself if you're considering to buy the game.Pro'sMixing up medicine, having to consider side effect and processing costs is actually a lot of funHas a ""Theme Hospital"" vibe which is fun!Lots of challenging levels that you can complete at Beginner, Advanced or Master level. Difficulty felt just right!ConsNo multiplayerThere are these ""competitors"" who you can't see or hear much about, only that they are working on the same market as you and, of course, against you. I'd love to have seen their companies too!Progression felt rather shallow; there aren't many machines to use. You can combine a lot however which is great, but perfecting medicine often results in high processing costs, making your drug unprofitable which is stopping you from making awesomely thought out layouts.At it's current price-point, there's not enough the game has to offer. I really enjoyed this game, but at some point I had the feeling of ""Ok, well this is it"" and hit a wall when I couldn't really progress any further. The game's various levels really do put up a good effort to delay that feeling though and it definitely improves replayability, but to me that didn't feel like a strong enough reason to keep playing. I feel that a game like Factorio would be a better choice for a comparable game. Big Pharma is definitely fun while it lasts, so consider getting it in sale; I'd value it at about 10 bucks.			"

												Fans of Factorio, FortressCraft Evolved, Rimworld, any type of resource management simulator.... please read below:This game is not for you. It feels immersive when you start but is very shallow in reality. All the extra stuff going on other than automating medicine and making money is pretty much cosmetic, the competition does not mean a thing, you can pretty much ignore what they do. World events are spam. Worst of all, it becomes repetative after the first level. It looks nice, it seems to deliver a lot only to feel empty. The missions/goals for each level are there but each level, you are doing the same thing, automating meds. The machines manipulating the medicine are simple and limited. They do not change appearance when upgraded. The workers working the machines just stand there the whole time operating the machine, no needs. This game is for a console or an iPad, thats about it.Sale price is 50% off, if you want something a bit mindless and time killing, I'd say grab it but I ultimately requested a refund and still didn't find it worthwhile at the sale price.

												So I really like strategy games, and I thought this would be more about managing a pharmaceutical company than puzzeling one. It's really just about figuring out how to put the machines together in a small space. In the 'research' and 'ingredients' tab you simply click and wait to get new features, rather than being able to play with it.There is almost no depth nor consequences of choice in this game. I've played it until the 10th scenario, but still it's really just a large puzzle.			"

												I have mixed feelings about this game. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends, but some may like it.I played this game after having played Factorio, and this felt like Farmville.There is a lot of problem solving in the game, but no flexibility/creativity whatsoever. There usually is only one way to solve things and the challenge usually is about the factory walls blocking the placement of the machines. This is what will take up 80% of your time while playing the game and this is a bit lame.There are lots of details and dynamics incorporated into the game, but these are of limited use to the player. The satirical bits about the pharma industry are the fun bit that renders the game worth playing. If you like Plague Inc., you should enjoy this too.My final judgement of ""not recommended"" is due to the price, which I find is slightly too high for this game.			"

												I really enjoyed the first 3 hours I spent with this game.But then I realized that every scenario you started is randomized. As in the room layout is randomized, the positive and negative effects of the ingredients are totally randomized meaning that you could start out with two ingredients that need to put through only one machine to become a perfect drug or you could end up with something that has terrible sideeffects and therefore sells like crap. It feels like the replayability of this game is there but in a weird way. I mean yes it creates a new challenge for you everytime you start a game since you have to adapt your builds to whatever hand you're dealt in the beginning but it just feels kinda tedious if you end up with a bad one and the computer just charges ahead giving you no real posibility to catch up.

Posted: November 23, 2015
												First off: I own this game from their website before the steam release, so my playtime is higher than the 0.4 hours it claims right now.TLDR: Even though I like many aspects of the game, I can not recommend it at its price as it will not keep you entertained for very long.Do I somewhat like the game? Yes.Would I recommend it? Not really, especially not for 23 Euros.I love the setting, I feel there should be way more disease/medical-related games and I do enjoy the graphics, by which I mean I don't mind the simplicity. I like the making of new drugs, the setting up of belts/arrangements, the tight budget, the slight humour, the ideas like exploration and the reasearch tree.So why wouldn't I recommend it? Because it gets boring, and it does so rather quick. The reason for this is, that its repetetive. Gamesessions usually are done in 1-3 Hours depending on difficulty and consist of you researching new techs and producing new medications with increased difficulty in the setup of your conveyer-belts.The Problem is that its the same each mission. And the Drugs/Ingredients are completly interchangeable. Unless youre a ""Letsplayer"" you wont care for the name of the made-up Drugs/Ingredients within seconds but they will just be stats like ""increase/decrease concentration by 3"" so thats all you do.You find the easiest way to reach that wanted concentration. And theres only (when fully researched) like 3 ways of increasing decreasing, meaning +/- 1 ; +/-3 ; half/double. So thats not hard! In fact nothing is really ""hard"" in this game. Theres no need to make difficult choices, as you will most likely produce every medice you can as far as research and exploration go, since every ""tick"" gives money, theres also no need to think about if you should keep the medicine going - if it ticks in money, keep it, if it loses money, replace it.The result is a very easy game and the ""challange"" comes from increasingly hard scenarios. But this doesn't mean anything interesting like ""do this-and-that with 3 rooms"" or so, no, while there are ~5 different types on missions they all play the same, as you just need to make more of the best kind of medicine, cure a number of people, make some money or something along those lines, so they all mean you build up your, lets say ""empire"" and then at some point you win. And weather your task is to make 5-super-medicines or to make X Million $ doesnt matter as you do the very same thing. The Difficulty of the Game (which does go quite high in the late game) only comes from increasingly narrow timelimits, so the medium and hard difficulty is identical, except in one you need to make (lets say, not sure about the real number right now as it doesnt matter) 5 Milion in 10 years and on hard its 10 Million in 5 Years.So after 10 hours lets say you will start more than your 10th game (the easy games go by rather fast) and you will do the very same thing the 10th time in a row, still not caring. And since setting up the conveyer belt-systems is the only real aspect, and you do that about once every 5 minutes, you will have done that about 120 times. And then its just routine, theres no fun to be had (there hasn't been in quite a while) and all you do is click your new belt, wait for money to pour in, click your new belt a.s.o.			"

												Overall, I had fun with the game. Nothing exposes your inner evil than becoming a pharmaceutical executive. The gameplay is not too complex, mostly based around creating production lines increasing and decreasing concentration or adding new ingredients to reach the higher tier drugs or to add special effects. Building machinery is similar to tetris: rotate the fixed input and output points until the shortest connection between them is possible or they take up the least amount of place.Few issues:- Most maps are badly designed, as a result of the tetris-like elements. Buildings are oddly shaped, full of narrow passages and corridors that make placing fixed sized and shaped machines frustrating or requiring a lot of moving around. I would personally prefer a more Prison Architect style gameplay where I can freely design buildings to suit my needs.- Just as real medical research, I assume, production lines involve certain amount of rial and error. Some machines remove some effects, but so far I found no explanation for that. The mixers lack labeling on input, so the first mix is a trial and error in determining what will be the base and what the additive.- The upgrade system is uninspiring. Purely decrease the operating cost of a machine by x amount of money. No tech to increase speed, improve supply, or anything more meaningful. A deeper, more diverse research system would be nice.- The AI does weird things. I developed Drug A. Cornered the market to 90%. The AI developed Drug B, a less effective version of Drug A. Got the 10%. So far so good. But over time, based on its less effective drug, with a higher price tag and a lower sales rating, it managed to muscle me out of the whole market with no rational explanation.- The patent system is ridiculous and broken, just like in real life I guess. I have been selling a drug I developed ahead of the competitors for 10 years. Then the AI slaps a patent on it, and retroactively pulls mine off the market. That would be like me patenting apples and hitting all fruit farmers with a cease and desist letter which there is no recourse for. It is an unfair, broken and gimmicky system that should not be in the game in its current form. Drugs already on the market should not be subject to the system, it should be an option once you developed a new drug.In conclusion, I do not regret my purchase. The game is fun albeit simplistic and sometimes a bit rough around the edges. It is still an entertaining management game. With some additional elements a sequel to it could be a really good game.

												In Big Pharma, you take the role of a CEO of a pharmaceutical company, and you have to take your fledgling company from minor painkiller pusher to mega-corporate cancer killer.At the start of the game, you are dumped into an empty factory lot where you will be able to start building production machines and start manufacturing some cures. Each segment of the factory will have an input point where you can choose to pull through certain ingredients which may or may not have positive attributes. Running these ingredients through a careful setup of specific machines will either emphasise or dissipate the base positive or negative effects of your ingredients. Once you’re happy with the result, throw what you have into a pill machine and pipe it out through one of your output points where it will be given a name and shipped off into the world to be sold. You can also put scientists hard at work to research some brand new machines and ingredients, or simply improve existing ones. This is a nice way to improve the quality of your production lines and keep a consistent, stable way of producing reliable cures and boost profits the legitimate way.The Marketing and Malpractice DLC helps to give you more control on the money side of things, and instead of just selling a cure for a set price throughout you can hike the cost of a drug when you know the demand is high and people are in desperate need of it; something as simple as a paracetamol may be in high demand after a tragedy somewhere in the world, and you can use it as an opportunity to charge a fortune for it. You can also undercut a competitor to gain your own company more money at the expense of theirs, adding new ways to play Big Pharma and causing you to be savvy off the production floor as well.Big Pharma does feel unique, as it’s rare to get an economic/sim game that was built from the design level up to be a morality play on human greed.People who enjoy business sims, and want to engage with something that requires planning without overzealous micromangement may find Big Pharma to be the cure.THE GOOD- Unique morality play in a sim game- Addictive gameplay - Adds a new personal approach to playing- Perks systemTHE BAD- Feels somewhat barren- Suffers from repetitive gameplay- Once you’ve played around with the features it loses appealDISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY | GOOD | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE			"

												The game focuses on setting up the production lines - it really isn't a business sim, but I don't think the game suffers because of it. Combining ingredients to get the desired effects, working within the confinements of your factory - there is plenty to think about. It can be very satisfying to tweak a production line to operate more efficiently, or to engineer out one of the pesky side effects. Probably do to my inability to think ahead, I'd have to re engineer my plans to overcome an obstacle I didn't anticipate. Researching better equipment opens up more options to formulate your products.On the first advanced scenario, money was much tighter and the game provided a tense challenge. Sometimes competing against the AI feels arbitrary, maybe because they're mostly just messages that pop up. I don't feel like they're going through the same process as me. They are effective though - I would curse them when they patented a cure that was on my production line and they provide for some interesting moments.My two main wishes are more fast forward levels and an online leaderboards so I can chase my friends' scores. Another nice touch would be to have a 'random' setting for each parameter when setting up a custom game. Many times games are more enjoyable if the player doesn't know quite what to expect and have to adjust their play once they discover what's going on.I've read some people's complaints about the amount of content included in Big Parma and I don't get where they're coming from. There are many scenarios, taking hours to complete. Setting up a custom game offers more play for those who want it too.So, if you enjoy setting up and tinkering with production lines, my guess is that you'll like Big Pharma.

												Big Pharma requires you to fit a number of tetris-shaped machines in as little space as possible in order to make drugs for profit. I'd love to say there was more to the game than that, but sadly there really isn't. All the challenges are basically the same, which makes the game very repetitive and it gets boring very, very fast. SImply not worth the price. You can get mobile games for free that are much more worthwhile and will give you many more hours of entertainment.I bought this in early access (and got the Steam version for free, but never played it on Steam) and expected a lot more to be added to the game, but was then surprised when the release date was announced, constantly thinking ""that has to be a mistake, it's not remotely done."" But no, Tim considered it done and it was released. Sorry, Tim, but you made a bad game.The good part:- Figuring out how to turn ingredients into drugs using as few machines as possible is fun, at first. - Trying to create crazy drugs by combining different cures that aren't normally combined can be fun, at first.- Watching all the machines work is fun, for a while.- You can name all your drugs whatever you want, which is also compeltely pointless because there's no multiplayer so there's no one to laugh at the names you use.But then comes all the bad (and the list is only short because there's so little to the game):You have AI opponents who for the most part only seem to be there as decoration. They're no real challenge and even with the patents it's not a problem to beat them because you can just make another drug that's slightly different. You never feel cornered or like you have to rush. The only challenge remains beating the timer if you care at all about scoring gold on everything (which in itself doesn't earn you anything whatsoever other than a golden line on the scenario selection screen).Once you beat the first scenario you know how to beat the rest of the game. The only thing that changes is how fast you have to make your money and what drugs you can make. Nothing else changes.Tim (the developer) has a background in simple mobile games and it shows in Big Pharma: It lacks depth, it lacks complexity, and everything is over-simplified to the point where you have no control over any of the things that would have made the game remotely interesting. I wasn't the only one who asked for a more complex economy, but Tim felt it wasn't needed. Unfortuntely having no control over the economy means it doesn't really matter what you do because prices fluctuate at random. It also means that half the info screens don't matter because you can't do much at all to affect your economy anyway.Tim's idea that ""scoring gold on a mission can be incredibly motivating"" doesn't fly when the game is so incredibly boring to play and has no real content. You simply have nothing to do, ever, other than plopping down the machines, connecting them with belts, and trying not to lose count of whether you needed two or three machines to get the right concentration.Meanwhile you scream for more to do and bang your head against the wall to express your frustration for yet another incomplete game that was released with no plans for more content.

												Big Pharma is a tycoon-style game based around pharmaceutical development. It holds the isometric view of classic games like Rollercoaster Tycoon while being graphically sleek. As with its tycoon-style roots, it also contains puzzle elements as the equipment you must use act as puzzle pieces that you must fit together in a fixed amount of space.So what makes this game appealing?Firstly, it's a management simulation game. If you're as big a fan as Rollercoaster Tycoon as I am, chances are you'll enjoy this game just on the style of the game alone.As for how the levels are set up, there are several categories of scenarios each with their own set missions. These categories range from Beginner to Advanced difficulties, along with Quick Play and Crippling Debt categories, the last of which severely handicaps you if you're looking for a challenge!When it comes to dropping into a scenario, the building space and ingredients you have at your disposal are completely randomized. This means you can start the game with a nice area to start building in, or perhaps a not so nice area. It also means that you can have ingredients that induce negative side effects or not. But no fear! You can buy more space with the money you have and discover more ingredients through exploring different biomes for new raw materials to make cures to illnesses with so overcoming a rough start is entirely doable.Exploring for new ingredients is a must as well as researching new methods to manipulate the drugs to turn them into cures. The ingredient system works very well in my opinion. Sometimes you just have to change the concentration of the ingredient to make higher level cures but sometimes you also need to mix it just right with catalysts to make the drug a higher selling product which adds more layers of depth to production.With all that, there are also competitors that influence the drug market in their own unique way that isn't the same each time you play. Competitors may release the same drug as you have, saturating the market with supply which brings the price of the drug down a little. So release patents to stop them and hope they don't do the same to you!This game, while simple at its core, offers a great managing experience and varying levels of challenge even within each mission through three different win-states. The win-states are like a ""Bronze, Silver, Gold"" medal type system which rewards both casual and hectic play.What may users not like about the game?If you’re like me that wants to try to perfect everything and max out the space you’re given? There's ALWAYS something that requires your attention, requiring you to be ready to do a whole list of things until you end up closing out of the game or pause it to take the dog for a walk. There's no real time to take a step back and admire what you create or take a breather. Even on the beginner levels there are always ways to enhance production, make new production lines, enhance ingredient discovery or research, etc. However, you can choose to take the game slow if you want; there’s nothing stopping you but the goals you set for yourself when you drop in!Also just a note, this is one of those games that you need to play the tutorial to really get a good foundation on how to play.If you're still indecisive, I've made a small video series of me playing the game trying to reach master level on the game. I jump right into it and explain how everything works and I believe you'll know if it's a game for you within a few minutes of skimming through gameplay.

												I initially saw this game at Eurogamer and I pretty much decided to buy it based on the the bare bones beta they had on show. The full version has not disappointed me. A good puzzle/management game with a fair amount of challenge and room to play around. Easy to learn the basic mechanics of it but challenges you to put these into practice. The game consists either of the challenges or the freeplay option (I have been playing the challenges). The challenges I have played so far have a good level of difficulty, providing a challenge, while you explore the various options within the game. As the ingredients are randomised, it makes each game slightly different, as you attempt to create more and more high value drugs. i've seen some reviews complain about the price, which I can understand, as the game can appear quite basic. However, I feel that this game is a solid game, which has been well thought out, and I feel that I will be putting many more hours into this game.			"

												I defintely recommend Big Pharma for a simulation and strategy game.  It is well made, has lots of scenarios to burn through, as well as free play mode if you want to play around. Pros:+Excellent time waster+Interesting, inventive concept with unlimited replayability+Interesting scenarios with scaling difficulty+Beautiful game with great flexibiliyCons-Can get dull after several hours at it especially at higher levels-other AI firms constantly patent everything they make not allowing you to sell the product anymore-Hard to compete with AI at higher levels-complex game not really kid-friendly designOverall I'd defintely give a 9.5/10.  If you are at all on the fence BUY THIS GAME!!  It is a great concept and exciting when drugs come together the way you want them and horribly aggrivating when nothing comes along as you want or you don't have room in a factory.  Just wait until your competitor issues a patent on that thousand dollar syringe you are banking on!			"

												Big Pharma is obviously a business management sim, but it has some unique things going for it that distinguish it from other types of business management sims and give it a unique hook.First let's discuss the normal business management aspects. You run a company that makes drugs, and there are essentially three areas of the company you have to manage. The first is that you need the space and the equipment to make the drugs, which means you will need to spend capital to purchase floor space and then you will need to spend more capital to purchase machines to go on that floor space that are used to make your drugs. (There is a LOT more complexity to this part of the game, but we'll get into that later.) The second area is research, which is pretty much just an unlock tree. You pay an initial flat rate to hire a scientist and then also pay each scientist by the hour. The more scientists you have on payroll, the more quickly you'll rack up research points, but that obviously gets expensive, so you need to balance with your income. Research unlocks new machines, new shipping methods, access to new drug recipes, ability to file patents on your recipes, and more. The third area is exploration, which is a tree similar to the research tree. In this area you pay a flat rate to hire explorers and then also pay them by the hour. You deploy your explorers to search jungles, deserts, oceans, etc for new or rare ingredients. By discovering new ingredients with new properties, you have access to new recipes that can be used to make a variety of new drugs. Explorers also have their own research points which you can spend to reduce the purchase price of ingredients and reduce your cost of materials.These are the basics. Know that you will always have rival companies that are manufacturing and selling drugs in competition with you, and if the rival company's drugs are of a better quality than yours, they can eat up your market share (i.e. you will make fewer sales and earn less money due to your competitor stealing your customers). In the early modes and difficulties, competitors are a breeze to deal with. They can be more of a menace in later modes, though, for sure.Okay, so what is the unique hook? The unique hook lies in purchasing floor space and machines and then assembling production lines. It is a complicated PUZZLE. Bear with me, because this gets a tad complex. Every ingredient you have to work with has four effect slots, and those four slots are filled with effects. The slots can either contain a curative effect, a negative effect, or simply be empty. The easiest ingredients to work with tend to have one curative effect and one negative effect. The more difficult ingredients have one curative effect and three negative effects. In addition to these effect slots, each ingredient also has a CONCENTRATION value that can be anywhere between 1 and 20. The higher the number, the higher the concentration. Each of the effects in the four slots has a random concentration interval assigned to it, and the effect is only ACTIVE if the concentration falls within that interval. For example, if the ingredient has the curative effect SOOTHES COLD that is active between 11-14, and the negative effect CAUSES CONSTIPATION that is active between 5-12, and the default concentration of the ingredient is 12, then THAT means that both effects are active in the ingredient, so you have to put the ingredient through a machine that will change the concentration so that the curative effect is active and the negative effect is not active. So if you change the concentration to 13, it is still within range to soothe colds, but it will no longer cause constipation. Get it? Still with me? It gets even crazier.Okay, so obviously there are machines that can change the concentration value of an ingredient to alter the effects. But sometimes you have ingredients with three negative effects and it is literally impossible to deactivate all of the negative side effects, so then what do you do? Well, there are also machines that can shake up the order of the effect slots, and machines that can swap effects between two ingredients. So if you're clever, you can swap negative effects out and positive effects in. In some situations, you can even create super drugs that have multiple positive effects! The problem is that it can require a lot more machines to make these crazy drugs, which is not only more expensive to purchase the machines, but each machine also has a per-use cost as well, so it is in your best interest to have as few machines as possible. UGH. DECISIONS.There are other ways to deal with negative side effects as well. For example, you eventually learn that not only does every effect have an active range, but every effect also has a ""sweet spot"" number, which is a specific number between 1 and 20 where the effect is 100% effective. So you can research your own drugs to find the sweet spots and improve your drug quality, which is important so that your competitor doesn't steal your buys with better quality drugs. And of course there are some interesting technologies you can unlock that don't really pertain to concentrations or effects but are still highly useful in other ways. There is really A LOT in here to learn and figure out.Oh, and don't forget that you actually have to manually place each machine on the factory floor, rotate it, hook up the conveyor belts yourself, etc. Sometimes you have enough funds to set up a production line for a new drug, but you're out of floor space because you built too many huge production lines and you can't fit the new one in there. (Discontinue a line of drugs to make room for a new one? DECISIONS.) So there is also a spatial puzzle element of using the fewest machines possible, laying the conveyors to actually complete the circuit, arranging your machines and production lines in such a way that it doesn't get in the way of future building and/or allows you to upgrade or expand the current production line later as new ingredients become available.There are lots of different difficulties, modes, and objectives to play. There is even a sandbox mode where you can get all machines, all tech, and are given infinite money, so you can experiment with the machines to figure out what all of them do. (Some people may be confused about how the mixer works at first, so having a safe place to test and observe it is helpful. Combining the mixer and shaker is an advanced gameplay strategy that is difficult to understand or use without a bit of practice and experimentation, so sandbox mode helps with that as well.)Mods are available from the dev if you want to change up certain aspects of the game. For example, some people (including me) don't think it makes much sense that by default it is impossible to move conveyor belts without selling them and rebuying them at a loss, so you lose money for just correcting/moving conveyors (which is not the case with machines). So there is a mod to make conveyor belts free, which I recommend. (Though what they should have done for best balance, IMO, is just make the buy/sell price the same.)Tutorial is well done. It is very hands on, but also easy to skim through quickly for those who have little patience and just want to get down to business (i.e. me).Highly recommended for business sim lovers---especially if you like the idea of having some headscratching and puzzling thrown into the mix. You REALLY have to plan with this one.			"

												I've been playing this game since its early beta days back in June 2015. Big Pharma might look like your run of the mill tycoon game, but it is much deeper than that. The concentration system for drugs, the random ingrediant generation and robust AI compeditor performance (especially on higher difficulty levels) lends this to be a very interesting and *very* replayable game. Sure the random nature might mean that the available ingrediants are awesome in one game and suck in the next...but since everybody in the game plays with the same pool of ingrediants, the challenge is to make the most of what is available. This is also a part puzzle game as you try to figure out how to cram your more and more complex production lines into a limited space. It can be extremely satisfying to have nearly every square inch of an area filled to the brim with drug machinery humming with their various drug modifying operations. The tech tree is laid out in a logical but still strategic manner. Researching techs takes scientists and keeping scientists employed is expensive, so deciding which techs to go for in which order is important. Given the variable ingrediants each game, you aren't going to always want the same path down the tech tree each game. Not to mention you have to weight the options of leaving your scientists idle, which generates research points that are used to upgrade your equipment (making it cheaper to operate) or use them to research new techs, giving you access to brand new equipment or other discounts. If you are a fan of business tycoon games at all, this game is for you. It is absolutely worth the price of admission.			"

												I got Big Pharma before it came out on steam and I had a blast trying it out! Now that it is done, I can't wait to see how they improved and what they added!To sum up Big Pharma (from what I know)It is a game that puts you in the point of view of a medicinal company that makes and sells drugs, however you are a villanious company that does whatever it must to make a profit, even if that means lying to the consumers.Overall I rate this game 8.5/10 because it is a fun, easy to learn, and thought-provoking game that I enjoy!

												This game is one of my best recent purchases. I got this at 66% off, but 21 hours in, I can definitely say it is worth full price.I completed the tutorials in about 90 minutes, and it has taken me a further 20 hours to beat all the beginner levels to Master standard.I've just moved up to Intermediate level, and discovered that there are a whole load of new machines and research topics, plus more cures, ingredients, side-effects, and ways to combine them together! I wasn't expecting such a leap in complexity, and I still have not checked out the Advanced levels yet! I've also noticed, that many of the achievements seem interesting, and might be worth pursuing in their own right.Before purchasing. I read some of the negative reviews, which mentioned the randomness of the game, and repetitive nature of the gameplay. Sure, some of it is repetitive; when starting a new level, you have to build up your factory and income, but the randomness is a good thing - in different games, different ingredients lead to different cures and side-effects, and you have to combine them in different combinations. You have to think - you can't just keep repeating the same cures you developed in previous games. In my view, that's a very good thing!There are so many aspects of this game, and it is much deeper than I expected. I've yet to unlock and discover all the elements of the game, but already I can see the potential for creating super drugs which cure multiple illnesses at once, and could potentially be worth thousands of dollars. That kind of drug won't be easy to create, but is definitely doable if you make the right combinations.Do yourself a favour, and just buy it!			"

												I don't know how you'd pin this, so let's just call it what it is: stressfully funIts got something of a puzzle in the mix, where you gotta create drugs with certain effects, but those effects can only be made known with certain machines, and its really easy to mix up what machine does which.Its graphically what you'd expect, music is good, tutorial is a bit hamfisted but it gets the job done. I do wish the machines were'nt so odd to drop onto the lab floor. LIke, some of them are 's' shaped, where the input is on the opposite side of the output, and its also sideways, so you gotta spend more time working around an oddly shaped machine in order to run it through the exact same oddly-shaped machine, and its never quite fun to do so.However, seeing everything come together makes all that effort worth it to great effect.A great game to get on sale, and when you're bored.8/10			"

												Started a company called Turing Pharmaceuticals. I made a drug that cured cancer and was hailed as the saviour of the human race. Little did the world know that during the clinical trials, it was shown that my ""cure"" also caused other types of cancer to develop in 97% of the patients. I hid this fact from the scientific community with a series of well placed bribes and I basically had a licence to print money. 10 Martin Shkreli's /10 for realism.			"

The descriptions and videos are very forward about what type of game this is.  This is NOT a Theme Hospital type game.  It's a puzzle game where you create manufacturing lines to create medications for the hospitals and pharmacies.  If you watch a video and it looks fun, you'll love the game.  If you watch the videos and it looks boring, you definitely will be bored.Insta-buy on sale.  Highly recommended on retail price.  I've had a lot of fun with this game!			"

												I heard about this game and saw a couple of lets plays on it, then bought it.  It is a very simple game, but it is not easy.  You start with a production floor, which can be increased.  The production floor is randomly generated, so it is different on every game.  The ingredients are also randomly generated with both positive and negative affects.  There are 20+ challenges with 3 different levels of completion each.  Not to mention the equipment and upgrades.  Is it repetitious at times, yes, but so are every other game in a similar genre.  The randomized aspects of the game keeps you from doing the same exact thing from challenge to challenge.  And the game does not take itself too seriously.  Yes, you can make a migraine medication that has headaches as a side affect.  And lets not forget the names of the medications you create.  You can name them yourself, or have the computer do it for you.  With a female contraception called (by the computer) Jeff's Preg Be-Gone, how could you name anything better than that.Overall, it is a good game, and I paid full price for it, $25.  I do not normally pay full price on games, but wanted to support the developer.			"

												Have you ever played an RTS where you get really immersed in building the perfect base, but every new level throws away your hard work and forces you to start again from scratch? Big Pharma is like a distilled version of that. It has 35 levels, all of which start you near the bottom of the tech tree. Pretty much every level will start the same - 10-20 minutes of building low-level supply chains, trying to get a profit while you wait for research to unlock. To make matters worse, building the supply chains is actually really tedious as you have to jump through the menus to research each stage of the process before you build it. You're constantly fighting to make a profit, and many of the levels have time limits. Don't let my high playtime fool you - I was afk for a lot of that. Big Pharma is only good for about 3 hours. After that, there's just too much tedium and not enough fun.			"

												My fear in purchasing this was that I'd be bored of it in 5 minutes.  I'm glad to say that I was wrong.Don't be fooled by the simple, clean UI---Big Pharma is a surprisingly deep simulator where the logistical puzzle of placing machinery to assemble your drugs is the least of your worries.  For me, the real difficulty of the game was interacting with the drug market, where you must balance drug prices, market saturation & also keep an eye on what your competitors are doing (if they're importing the same ingredient as you, for example, that ingredient may become oversaturated & its price will rise, hurting your bottom line).You can flood the market with a side effect-laden drug for some quick cash if you want, but consumers will eventually figure it out & punish you as your cure rating drops & your drug starts losing money.My only criticism of the game so far is that it lacks a planning stage where you can lay out your production lines in advance.  I had to repeatedly switch between the Ingredients & Cures tabs to work out how to develop a level 3 cure, and keeping track of the machines that I needed quickly became overwhelming.  In the end, I'd go to the Production tab to place a couple machines, then back to the Ingredients & Cures tabs to figure out what machines to place next.A planning stage that tells you the concentrations/catalysts of imported ingredients (from the Ingredients tab), how to get to the cure (from the Cures tab) & the concentration/catalyst of the drug as it exits each machine in the planned line would be incredibly useful.  Then click a button to commit the entire thing, and you're done.Also, when I'm deciding which machines to upgrade, it'd be very helpful to know how many of that machine I have across all my production lines.  For now, I can scan the lines to get a rough idea, but this is another example of mental gymnastics that the game could eliminate.Big Pharma is a game that I wouldn't hesitate to pick up on sale.  I'll be following this one for sequels/expansions.(This review was for version 1.00.04 of the game.)			"

												Interesting game, but a bit long and tedious.  Game could seriously benefit from faster speed acceleration than is currently available.  The lack of an area selection tool to move or delete sections of production line is also a noticeable negative.  The pieces all have set shapes, which is part of the puzzle element of creating drugs.  But this works to the games disadvantage as well.  You end up with such chaotic and ugly lines of production that you lose some of the joy and pride of accomplishing a difficult creation.  I'd rather have the option of choosing between multiple shapes for each device.  It would also be very nice to feed one device directly into another without a conveyor belt.Later on in each mission, you have a large amount of ingredients and production lines.  There is no nice clean link between the screens that show ingredients, production, and your outputs.  It would be extremely helpful to show something as simple as ""You are buying 90 of these per month.  This ingredient is used in 3 outputs"".  This also doesn't belong on the giant graph/screen on the right once you click on an ingredient.  It should be in the descriptor block for each ingredient.Click on an ingredient, drug on the cures page, or on one of your drugs under the company page, should show you where on the production map those items are being imported or exported.  This would alleviate some of the tedium.  Or at least on the production map you should be able to zoom way out, and still see the ingredient and output icons that you can see while zoomed in.  Finding one light pink pill on a jumbled messy map is annoying.If you want a puzzle game, go play Infinifactory.  For an economic sim game, the lack of reporting and inspection into how things are going are lackluster.  For a casual game, each level just takes too long.			"

												I wish there was a way to write a neutral, as I could go either way on this game.Obviously, I have played a lot of hours, but as another reviewer mentioned, you get to the point of wanting to complete all the missions/scenarios instead of playing for fun.Figuring out how the machines work, strategies for making money, etc are fun at first.  What happens is it takes some time to get machines unlocked, etc. while playing in missions, so you find yourself doing essentially the same strategy for every scenario up to the point of fulfilling the mission objectives.  For example, several missions are ""earn xxx profit in xxx time"" - well that's easy enough once you have done it for $1,000,000 you can do it for $10,000,000.  There are missions like ""cure xxx xxx times"" or ""supply xxx drugs"", again, once you do those once, it's fairly easy to repeat.  The AI players are pretty much a non-threat.I believe there's a good 20 hours of playtime in the game.  After that, it starts to become repetitive.My advise:  Buy it on sale.  $15 or under would be OK.To the devs:  Game is good but too expensive for what it is - I wish the missions were more varied.  I wish you could really ramp up the difficulty and the AI was an actual competitior.  For example, being able to bankrupt the AI or having the AI complete the same mission objectives you are would be good.			"

												This game is like the baby brother of factorio. There's still plenty to do though. Completing all the cure's even in the largest of maps at the same time is no easy feat (assuming your also pumping out each of its predesessors). Its pretty fun, looks good. Concept is great and gameplay is smooth and intuitive.HOWEVER.. i honestly dont think its worth £18.99. I grabbed it on sale for £7.20 or something with the DLC and it is totally worth that as after 7.7 hours played so far i would say for me there's not a great deal of replay value. Whereas Factorio being outside, and much MUCH bigger you're able to plan your routes etc far more imaginatively and keep pressing for that every more efficent factory. This, not so much as even with changing building sizes you're still always limited and that in itself is great to start with but when you have to start removing production queues to fit in another stage of anoter drug it lets it down a little for me.So yes, i would recommend this game to anyone who likes these kinda games, its great if not a little limited. Pick it up on sale if you can as i would have been left slightly dissapointed at full price but had fun none the less.			"

It would also be highly recommended that before you play a campaign in this game, you might want to head over to the tutorials (big mistake I made) All in all I think this game is very decent for what it is, I only have one problem and that is the price is high for the game, now if your really big in Tycooning games, the price should be fine, but I find it a tad bit overpriced, but that might be my cheap self getting in to it.

+ The gameplay is extremely addicting. Basically you are building a lab full of assembly lines that take raw ingredients and converts them into medicine or pills to sell for profit.+  Visually the game looks great with a very nice clean charming style. Once you build a bunch of machines it can be very entertaining to just sit back and watch your factory essentially print money.+ A lot of strategy and planning is involved while designing your machines. You will often have to move around or completely change a line to develop an even greater product. Every machine has a different entry and exit point, so you really have to keep in mind how much space you have, and try to make things compact.+ Surprisingly complex. I found the game to be a tad hard to learn at first, but once you grasp the concept it will feel very rewarding as you learn how to upgrade and mix ingredients to form greater level cures.+ A LOAD of content. If you plan on beating the game I'm sure you can spend over 40 hours easily as each level is quite time consuming. (which is not a bad thing)- The tutorials were very lengthly and a bit tedius to get through as they have you read through a bunch of instructions rather than introducing the mechanics in a more fun way. (A narrator could have helped)- There isn't any information that tells you the supply / demand for each type of drug. Therefor, you do not really have any idea what a new drug will sell for. I'd often find myself spending quite a bit upgrading an assembly line to make a higher tier medication only to find out that the new medication was not selling for much and there's no way I could have known.

												A really good game. It's a very nice blend of puzzle/economic strategy genres.It has something in overall visual that reminds me Theme Hospital, though this is an other kind of game. "

												This is a fantastic game, designed and built by someone who clearly understands the concept of what makes a game fun.It's a game for people who like to think, strategize, and carefully plan their next move.  There's enough variability that every game is different, beyond the many different goals of whatever scenario you're playing.If you're tired of running around destroying things and blowing up monsters, and just want to chill and enjoy a colorful game of managing, optimizing, building, and puzzle-solving, you really can't go wrong with this one.

												Yes:If you're a fan of games like Rollercoaster Tycoon or Theme Hospital then this game is definitely for you. The main challenge is in laying out your production lines - making them as efficient as possible so you can squeeze more machines and manufacture more and complex cures in the limited factory floor space given to you.It can be maddeningly difficult, but in a good / challenging way, trying to work out how to get yourself out of the corner you've painted yourself into.No:I haven't played through every scenario yet, but feels like the game eventually runs out of new challenges and things to master. Getting really good at the main game takes a while, but once done, it's fairly easy to bring in the money and completing the scenarios just becomes a matter of the details.Overall:The game is definitely worth the entry price for fans of the genre. Will be interesting to see if it gets any expansions or interesting mods			"

												Great game, did not regret buying it. It's not the game you will be playing like forever, but a couple of dozens of hours and an ok replayability is here. The economic part is not that strong, but it is still there hidden under the hood, and understanding some of those not too simple under the hood interactions is crucial for beating the master level of more difficult missions. The great thing about the game is the puzzles of fitting every processing unit into your tight area and the tradeoffs of what exactly you want to produce: a cheap low quality product, an expensive perfect medicine with no side effects, maybe you make cream instead of pills to reduce side effects instead of expensive process of removing it, or screw everything and simply do not produce that type of medicine. And those competitors with their patents...rrr! Great stuff, quite simple at a glance, quite challenging if you want to master it, that's what I want of the game that does not pretend to be the best in genre for all times but still is way above average thanks to a number of small but enjoyable details. I feel the game could even be one of the best of its kind if added a bit more divercity, deepness and maybe an additional few layers of what you work with, hopefully in the same manner the complexity already exists: not critical to know if you don't want to bother but extremely useful to max out your perfomance.

												If you love to craft items and watch your bank account grow than this is the game for you.  However if you were looking for a management sim in which you compete against other companies for the right to call yourself the best of the best than you may be disappointed.  There were times that I did not even think about the other companies until they pulled out the patents on drugs which made it slightly more difficult to money.  All in all a fun game that has different types of drug concentrations with each playthrough but falls short in the overall big picture

			A game that is very interesting to micro manage the intricacies of being a large pharmaceutical company. However the game lacks end game depth and overall feeling of accomplishment.

												Big Pharma is a fantastic hybrid of a business sim and a puzzle game, but not in the sense of a conventional puzzle game. You design your own puzzles (the assembly lines) for products that the market demands. It is hugely satisfying to determine what remedy you want to develop and then design hugely complex assembly lines to create them. I recommend this game to those who like critical thinking and management.			"

												I've never left a review before, despite owning a couple of hundred games on Steam. But after playing Big Pharma I felt compelled to. Hopefully that alone is testiment to how good it is.There are enough reviews on here already to give people a good flavour of the game's content and mechanics, so I'll keep it brief. The aesthetic is heavily reminiscent of Bullfrog's classic 'Theme Hospital' and so is the music. The mechanics are an ingenius blend of puzzle game and business simulation.If those things sound like your cup of tea, this game is a must buy. If not, it's probably still worth picking up in a sale to find out if it could be...			"

												This game is pretty fun. I haven't played much of it but plan to play more of it. Now I will say this, I'm not very good with learning game mechanics and how to function and this game is confusing at times, but it is pretty fun once you know some of the basics. It would also be highly recommended that before you play a campaign in this game, you might want to head over to the tutorials (big mistake I made) All in all I think this game is very decent for what it is, I only have one problem and that is the price is high for the game, now if your really big in Tycooning games, the price should be fine, but I find it a tad bit overpriced, but that might be my cheap self getting in to it. Do I recommend it? Yes, I do recommend it but I recommend you stick around for a sale and it's a little bit more towards its actual value			"

												Big Pharma is a logistics min/max puzzle game mixed with a lightweight market simulation.  You'll make decisions regarding the quality of your cures vs. the strength of their side effects vs. the profit margins you get for selling them vs. the randomly-generated sized and shaped warehouses available to build in.To go along with this, you'll have to work through a Research tree to gain access to better equipment and new ingredients as well as many ways to discount the various costs and/or efficienices in the game.  The better equipment is needed for making higher-end cures as well as making cures with less overall machines that might require more creative conveyor belt routing.  Some machines do take more turns to complete an action so now I need to build another conveyor line going this way and then bring them back together over here and then I just need to...  ahem...  There's also an Ingredients tree where you'll send explorers to various places to unlock the ability to cure other diseases.  Some of these ingredients have special catalysts that you'll need to use to upgrade other ingredients.  Upgrading lets you develop cures for the more difficult and expensive diseases to treat.  All ingredients have side effects though that can vary widely - adding another layer of difficulty.  Inactive explorers will help you reduce the costs of your ingredients as well so you can bring up your profit margins without having to sacrifice a cure's quality because that stupid jerk other company is stealing my marketshare and my patent won't finish for another three months and staying in the green is tough right now so I just need to... ahem...The game's main story mode has a really great variety of challenges to play through.  The tutorial levels are a spot-on introduction to the game and do a good job of preparing the player for the regular game.  The difficulty does ramp up pretty quickly between the columns - especially when there are additional competitors in the game.  Some of the levels are really straight-forward and you'll knock them out in no time flat.  Other levels are like trying to eat frosted mini-wheat cereal without milk, for lunch, while sprinting across the Sahara Desert being chased by whatever crazy hallucinations the sun poisoning has developed because writing this review is going on too long now so I just need to... ahem...Go play some more!Tldr; This is one of those games that makes me physically stop and ensure I don't have anything else going on for the next 2-7 hour long binge session.

												One of the best ""factory"" games I've played. Definitely a fun game that's got a lot of long-term playability (currently 50+ hours played). I had a bit of trouble at first figuring out how to do transmutations or whatever it is called to create more complex meds, but overall I found the game quite enjoyable, easy to learn, and a good mix of managing costs, productions and logistics. I have not played the expansion (and currently do not plan to, because price micromanagement doesn't see as fun), but the base game provides plenty enjoyment for me.			"

												Surprisingly good game. Put way more hours into this than I thought I ever would and I keep on playing. It keeps you engaged, when you work a problem out like compacting a production line into the smallest space possible in a cramped factory you legit feel good about it. Then your heart sinks when the market for that product falls out. Luckily you can save money, look for another ingredient that needs to be processed in a similar manner and with minimal effort crank out another drug. Or instead of selling the machinery at a loss you could re-use machinery different configurations or manufacturing lines to make a completely new process for another ingredient. Another thing, ingredients are randomized. This means you cannot make the same thing the same way. Ever. Each time you load a new level you have to think on the fly, formulate what conentrations you want, and if it's worth processing an ingredient enough to remove side effects. Sometimes side effects disappear with almost no effort, other times it's too cost prohibitive to even try unelss you want to make a drug at a profit-loss. What furthers the gameplay is competition. There are AI that can do exactly what you do in the game. All the dirty tricks and good recipes. They might not be as good as a human right out of the gate, you are typically the first to release a product, but each personality of AI can specialize in certain things. The CEO fellow goes around putting patents on easily made drugs like a prick, the nerdy looking old man makes very high-level drugs typically quicker than I would, sometimes an AI will make enough of a product that it drops market demand so you won't be on top in that market. This helps keep the game very fresh at all times, you don't know which AI you are facing and they can give you a run for your money at times. I can keep raving on for hours. I like this game a lot. It's not expensive, it's very cheap for what you get. It can run on Linux just fine, I play it on LinuxMint17 and the mouse isn't as responsive as windows but this isn't an FPS, you can pause this game any time you want. The expansion is an honest expansion and worth the $6 full price, adds so much more to Big Pharma. Very good game, it genuinely surprised me how much fun it is.			"

												If this game had a demo when it first came out, I would have undoubtedly paid full price.Instead I read many of the negative reviews and held off buying it until now.So there you have it game companies who insist on not putting out demos because ... well why?This is a great puzzle game, with enjoyable logistics.  I'm really disappointed I never got it sooner.The replayability is very high too, due to randomization of components that appear.It has a well designed learning curve.Latency in builds is much more impactful than it is in Factorio, because every belt movement point is 1 day of lost profits.Great game, and worth full price if you enjoy the tycoon genre with a little more weight of puzzle-solving thrown in than most tycoon games have.Con:  I do have to agree with other reviews, that it does get tedious at a certain point in the game.  Your mileage may vary.			"

												Initially, I liked the game.  But as I replayed, I found it pretty boring to always research ingredients and technology in the same order.  Music and graphics are poor for today's games, but I would have easily forgiven based on a cheaper price if it had great game play.  I just didn't think this really had it.  Also, I found myself SO frustrated on one of the Intermediate scenarios that I basically quit the game:  the scenario called for making XX of a highly complex drug and I felt like there was a glitch that wasn't allowing my drug to make its final transformation.  That did it for me.			"

												I wanted a game that presented me with moral dilemmas and such... what I found was an awkward ""tetris like"" gameplay where, if there is an interesting part, it's obfuscated behind layers of annoying interfaces. The relevant info to make decisions on the products was difficult to reach. Then, if I decided I wanted to make a change in my production lines, to reroute the paths and find room for each machine was a cumbersome process. I don't have much money.

												OverviewI have played for over 30 hours without mods or cheats and do not own the expansion pack. So far I have managed to progress to Intermediate level in the scenarios. From my experience this game is what a sim management should be.  With a bit of twisted humour thrown into the mix seen in classics such as Theme Hospital, Big Pharma is beautifully made and very entertaining with a lot of replayability. Interface and graphicsThe main menu looks like a mobile port but don't be fooled! The simplistic buttons and side menus in the main game add to the overall functionality of the game. There are options to change the resolution, sound and graphic quality in the game. The graphics are in the cartoon style. I personally prefer this because cartoon style graphics will age much slower than the more realistically styled games, if at all.GameplayThere are 3 game modes for you to play - Free Play, Custom Game and Scenario. Free Play is the sandbox level where every machine and research branch is already unlocked and you have no money. Custom Game is where you set your own criteria to win the game. All of the goals/criteria in the game are number based and it would be nice to have a little more variety in how you win like being the most or least ethical competitor in game (but this might be in the expansion). Other than that the gameplay is solid. There is a lot of scope for replayability. There are 3 ranks in each game: standard, expert and master. The higher up the rank, either you have to do more within the standard time limit, or you have a shorter amount of time to complete your criteria. It's not just about what the game tells you to do as I find that I set myself personal goals long after I have finished my game criteria on a certain level. A few funny bugsI have experienced some world events that were not logical at certain times. An example of this is the 'mild winter' event that popped up in May. I was also stuck on the 'Keep calm and carry on' scenario for a bit because none of the raw ingredients that were available to be explored in the game had the certain enzyme that I needed to be able to upgrade my drug to an anti-anxiety treatment. I made sure to explore all of the available areas.My verdictThis is a great game. It gets really addictive so don't pick this game up if you want to be productive. A solid 10.			"

												I'm disappointed that Big Pharma is not a game about someone who can't fit on a Tractor. Once I got over that initial shock, I was able to lose an entire afternoon/evening to this massively enjoyable game, that constantly had me planning 2 or 3 moves ahead. The visuals give a clear nod to Theme Hospital, which makes it a pleasure to look at as well as play, and the interfaces and menus are well designed in that I never felt lost searching through the multiple research and finance screens. Pros- Great visuals/audio- Addictive, well thought out gameplay- Rewards forward thinkingCons- No ""Big Farmer""Overall, my recommendation for this game is a huge yes!

												Got lost in this one. The luck involved is frustrating sometimes, but when things work it's really exciting. In most sims, once you set up your engine it becomes too easy, this one keeps you on your toes. As the market becomes saturated your drugs lose value and you need to invest capital to stay current. The loan system truly makes this game. Shopping terms to keep your business growing, yet in the green is great. Anyone who likes business simulators should grab this one, worth every penny.			"

												I'll be honest, I torrented this game first, but it was a really fun time-sink so I came by and bought it. 8.5/10It's challenging but not brutal, levels are similar enough to make it feel accessible and familiar but not so much that they're boring, and you can expect to spend hours upon hours of fun crushing your competition and convincing the sickly public into just accepting that curing their cancer will require your drug that causes anal warts.You'll spend a lot of time figuring out how to use the ingredients available to you and how to organize your assembly lines for maximum profit - if that sounds like something you'd enjoy, ignore the frame-rate drops you'll experience with enormously complex late-game facilities and buy this game now!

												Have played a lot of this game before it reached Steam. It has a very tycoon feel to it while being very puzzle like in the builds. It currently has 35 different challenge senarios that all have randomly generated buildings and ingredients with randomly generated possitives and negitives each time you start a new challenge so you can very much play the same challenge over and over and get an entirely different play through each and every time. The machines mechanics are for the most part well expained though there are some things that you learn by just doing. And say you don't like any of the scenarios or have beaten the master rank (basicly gold in a gold/silver/bronze rating system) of all the scenarios (which would take a long time to do even if your great at the game)  custom game has a ton of customization to it, choose anywhere from 0-3 competitors, 5-15 randomly generated ingredients, where you start with 2-5, how many catilist there are and their side effects, victory conditions of total revenue, operating profit, within x years, x products with atleast x profit or value or level, minimun cure rating, total products, and pay off loan, which you can combine in any fation, so say you want the winning condition to be where you have to have 3 pills that all make atleast $1,000 profit per pill produced all with atleast B cure rating within 15 years with no competitors, you can do that. You can also set what research you (and all competitors) start with and even what research is disabled in the game (so say you don't want anybody to be able to make patents you can disable patents).Then you get into settings like map size, event frequency, loan interest rates, plot cost, research speed, scientist saleries, scientiest hire cost, explorer saleries and hire costs, analyzing speed, patent speed, patent cost, cure market size, cure profit margins, starting money, starting loan, ingredient prices, process costs, build costs, research point accrual speed, ingredient point accrual speed, cure rate, infection rate... and all of these things don't have just like 5 settings, they are all sliders that have many many settings even if its not good at informing that well (for example plot cost you could set to where it says low and the first land may cost $500, but then you set it again in low but slightly in a different slider cost and now it costs $480 or $620 for the first one.Between the randomly generated buildings, the randomly generated ingredients, the number of custom challenges with 3 ratings that are fairly challenging to get the best rank on, and the sheer customability of custom games, you will find that this game is very replayable even doing the same challenge or even same custom game settings because even with the exact same custom settings the buildings and ingredients are randomly generated each time which also means what the competitors make which effects your profit margins also changes each time. And can be as challenging or easy as you want it to be. And even as quick or long as you want it to be depending on how you set all the custom game sliders and victory conditions.			"

Posted: November 3, 2015
												This is a clever little simulation game. The challenge comes in two forms. The first is a business management simulation, not unlike Theme Hospital or similar games. The second part of the game is a spacial puzzle. It starts out simply enough. Very simple production lines bring ingredients in and pump packaged drugs out with a few steps along the way to prepare the formula. As you progress in the game you will unlock many new ingredients and cures and technology used to prepare them.Initially, the game only offers you selections that are available at the current level. As such, the game appears quite basic on the surface for the first dozen or so scenarios. As you progress further in to the game, however, you unlock a great deal of new research projects and technology.Many of the negative reviews I am seeing for the game (not all, but many) are suggesting the game is very basic and has a short lifespan. These same reviews were mostly written by players who had between 2 and 6 hours of play time recorded. I suspect most of these players didn't even play long enough to see how much added complexity there is when you unlock patents and stage 4 cures, etc.Highly recommended to programmers or anyone who enjoys optimizing engines. The production line component of the is reminiscent of SpaceChem.			"

Posted: February 1, 2016
												I don't like puzzle games. That's my story and I'm sticking to it. I bought this game because it's a business management simulator. Thing is, the business management part is only half of it, if that. The restf is very much a puzzle game, but not one that requires you to go so in depth with your puzzle solving thinking that you end up with a migraine.When playing Big Pharma, you'll notice that most of your time is spent, with the game paused, trying to fit equipment into spaces that make it work well with other equipment, within the constraints of the sometimes awkwardly shaped space provided. Sometimes you'll find yourself thinking ""Geez, they must have made this chain of machines incompatible with this dumb building on purpose"", while at other times you'll think ""Wow, this fits so perfectly here, without wasting any space at all, that I must be doing something right!"" Odds are pretty good that the reality is somewhere in the middle, where there wasn't much thought put into it at all aside from using the shapes of the buildings to throttle the difficulty. You will be annoyed at the lack of space, irritated with the AI for seeming to be able to patent something just as you're ramping up to produce it, but overall, you will get a sense of strange euphoria, seeing your machinations chug along, making you lots of money -- and it is pretty darn easy to make lots of money in this game. That part isn't hard. The difficulty definitely comes from making the pieces fit in a way that accomplishes your goals, effeciently and on timie, without blocking you from making the next line. This is a great game to play with the background music turned off and your favorite tunes playing instead. That's not to say that the background music is bad. It's just mediocre, and mostly pointless. The graphics look exactly like they should for a game such as this -- good enough. They're not realistic but they're not so cartoony as to be a distraction from the puzzle aspects.There is no story or campaign or anything. The closest you get is the ""challenges"" screen, which is the first thing you see when you click ""New Game"", and offers various scenarios with challenges attached. There is a tutorial which is both easy to use and fairly comprehensive, though you'll probably have to Google some of the higher tier equipment to see how they work. The information is not hard to find, though, so that's not really a downside. Overall, Big Pharma is a pretty good game. The simplicity will draw you in and keep you hooked even well past the point where you're tired of doing the same things over and over again and, really, that's its biggest rub -- redundancy. From the moment you play the first game in the ""Beginner"" column to the moment you put it away, you're doing pretty much the same thing over and over again. Think about it as an assembly line simulation tied in with some simplified business management concepts and you've got a good idea of what Big Pharma is all about.You're simply placing machines in a way that will be as efficient as you can make them. Everything else is just details. Is that a bad thing? In this case, I don't think it is. To me, the repitition gave me a sense of comfort, knowing that, at the beginning of every scenario, I had at least some *idea* of what I was doing. The first level drugs are extremely easy to make, and they get you off the ground pretty quickly, though you are forced to get more complicated since you'll oversaturate the market with them if you just make those. It was when the idea of starting fresh became significantly more appealing than continuing to try and get Master Level of accomplishment at a scenario that I realized it was probably time to play something else. However, that was 80 hours in, which is not a bad return for a game that costs $25 when it's not on sale! I'll probably go back to it at some point, too.			"

												I jumped onto this while it was in beta and fell in love, I am happy to see it reach full release and look forward to play it again in a finished state.This is kind of an unique game, it kinda is a tycoon game were you build production lines to create and sell drugs while also search for new ingredients and do research for more options and better machinery. The production line building is more like a puzzler were the challenge lies to make a space efficient and use a minimal amount of machines to reach your goals.The ingredients you use have 4 ""slots""  on them each with 1 curing effect and also 1-3 negative effects, stacked into the negative effects are also catalysts that are required for many cures to be upgraded. To top that off the ingredients also have a concentration wich ranges from 0-20 and different effects (both good and bad) are active at different concentration levels.Altough the concept of the game is quite easy to understand, it can get quite complex as you advance and need to mix and match different ingredients while trying optimse the concentration levels for upgrades while simultaniously trying to run a full speed production with a minimal amount of machines usage for your super drugs. All this is done on limited space and ""sockets"" that you need to bring in ingredients and ship out the drugs.The machines you use ""never fits"" wich adds a great deal of challenge while also giving a glorious feel of accomplishment once the line for your anaesthetic that cure aids, alzheimers and functions as a male contraceptive.I highly recommend this game			"

It might cost you a lot of precious money though. You can use your money to hire scientists and explorers to make even better drugs that make even more money. If you have a great drug, then you can patent it to prevent the AI from making money off your invention. Overall a great game and if I keep talking I'll end up rambling a lot more than I already am.			"

												Don't be fooled by the hours played, I've put in at least 30 hours in the beta phase (outside steam).The good: Solid gameplay, in depth strategy combined with tactical considerations like space and use of import/export sockets, excellent replayability with custom level builder and sandbox modeAwesome graphics, animations and perfectly suited music. Watching your factory and drugs in motion is mesmerizing!Smoothest beta process I've ever been part of, very few bugs (personally never encountered any) and quick releaseNo 'missing' features that gamers are forced to pay again for in the form of DLC or add-ons. The game is complete on release.The bad:Umm maybe a bit difficult for new players to grasp? It's honestly not a difficult game but it's definitely a step up from the mindless clicking that most casual games ask for these days.As I was typing this I realized that expecting a game dev to put out a polished, feature complete game at release has become somewhat of a high expectation in the industry :( Big Pharma definitely meets it and then some! I do hope there may be some sort of expansion/sequel in the future but this is certainly not a game that is lacking content. Like the good old tycoon/city builder games of the 90s, Big Pharma doesn't hold your hand. Understanding the mechanics takes all of an hour or so but mastering the game is not so easy!I'd recommned this game to tycoon fans, puzzle fans and those that like to relax with their games.			"

 This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes. Summary: A surprisingly deep experience in the strategy genre. The game hits you over the head with the options for the custom game. Granted, it'll take a bit of time to understand all the elements the game, and the tutorial could be better at teaching you the game's elements. But once you get an understanding of everything the game has to offer, you'll find surprising depth. The game's strategy design is where it shines: what elements are adjustable and ones that are not are done with purpose and reason in my opinion. Dealing with competitors that actually can affect your gameplay in slight and even more direct ways was fun, and it made me a bit sad that there's no MP element of the game, as I really felt like the game could have truly shined there. When it comes down to it: I felt this game did something that I feel a lot of developers could learn from: start with a great base design, add the options later on, and designed it from the player's angle: and what they'd want. Rather impressed in the long run, and can recommend to strategy gamers out there. Gameplay Footage and Video Review:

			How does one exploit medicine? ALL THE PROFITS. ALL OF THEM. This key was obtained from the developer for review purposes.		

  Lists: +: Lots of customization options in terms of gameplay, and in particular with the custom game. Really can change the elements down to the most specific growth rates and research trees that are available. A lot of strategy games can learn from this level of customization. I cover strategy games rarely because of the type of player that I am (I'm the builder type, basically consider me the opposite of the zerg play style), but this game was right up my alley in terms of my game style, but other game styles as well.  Good balance of gameplay elements that don't overly punish you for not using them, but reward you for taking advantage of them. Cost vs effectiveness of the drug does make a difference, especially in the early going, but both strategies can be viable. Found that it stood the test of time in terms of variety with the smaller elements. Despite me restarting a lot due to my own personal weaknesses (aka wanting to perfect situations and so repeatedly starting again), I still found myself having fun.  This may seem weird to say, but some of the elements that you'd expect that aren't there (like setting the price of the drug) Actually like the restricted playing fields. Causes you to have your own puzzle mini-game regarding machine placement that works rather well.  Did I mention there's a good selection of options? There's a good selection of options.  There's apparently mod support. That's always a plus. -: Takes a bit of time to get going in terms of understanding. Lots of information to digest, and it could have been passed on to the player easier in the end. Tutorial could have been done better. Little rough around some of the edges. In particular with things like the belt controls feel like that there may have been a better implementation. Luckily, it's something that you can easily get adjusted to in time.  Would have loved to see a MP version of the game, but understand the development costs that would be required in order for that to happen. "

It has a mind demanding circuit based logic concept easy to access but very, very hard to master! It has challenges increasing in difficulty!

												I bought this game about three months ago, before it was released on Steam, and spent a ""few"" hours on it.There's not much to say: release drugs and more drugs on the market, make money, and win in each level/mission with a different technique. Research every single ingredient and machine in the game, learn how to use them, and make EVEN more money. Money. Money. And more money. :P P.S.: Yes, you'll end up addicted to this game.			"

												Big Pharma is a great game for everyone who likes planning, tweaking, optimization. Your task is to manage a pharma corporation by producing and selling drugs. To get the job done, you´ll find your self searching for the required ingredients that can be processed and transformed into almost endless varieties as you increase or decrease concentration, add ingredients to produce new treatments and upgrade their effects. To make things more difficult, almost all ingredients have side effects that you may remove, weaken, avoid (by manipulating concentration) or just accept as a necessary evil - but beware, strong side effects will lower your drug rating and value. To make matters more complicated, your factory equipment cannot be placed neatly into straight assembly lines - each machine type has its own layout and creating complex chains will indeed be a puzzle game. And things usually don´t stay in place once you add new options to your arsenal - I find myself frequently redesigning my factory layout to optimize it according to the newly unlocked machines (which you can research). All the while, different scenarios and settings require you to work towards a variety of different objectives, from just making cash to delivering a super-drug with high value.To sum it up:  This game makes you think! If you like complex problem solving tasks, this is definitely your game.			"

												This game has a bit of a learning curve since it's a bit like medicine where you need to remember what is in what situation in order to create the proper environment for another reaction, etc etc.  It's fun, I've burned time on it so far this weekend.  It's a bit frustrating learning about catalyst reactions (on the game, not in real life), and how to work machines, placement of machines, etc.Would I buy it again?  In a heartbeat.

												I'll say this is one mind bending game.Cons first:  First the interface does need a touch up.  The GUI needs work to help navigate from cure start to cure finish along the lines of what you need to do.  At the moment you constantly have to switch between tabs in the GUI to determine the proper course of action to produce your product, fortunately you can pause the game.  It is a bit tedious to do so and I would like to see something more streamlined that allows for easier production of your cure.Second, No multiplayer.  You do play against an AI.  The AI's production of similar products  will effect cure pricing and both you and the AI can issue patents to have sole ownership of a cure.  There are world events that dictate supply and demand so it would be great to have multiplayer for the same reasons.  Unfortunately in a multiplayer scenario there would have to be two requirements:  A: Make it turn based to get around the GUI issue, or B: streamline the GUI for faster recognition of steps.That's it for cons that I see.Pros:Game runs very well.  The GUI does look great.  You really feel like a factory floor manager.Nice graphics.  Everything moves flawlessly around your factory floor going from starting point to A>B>C>D>E sell (Sometimes more steps, sometimes less).The game has an awesome puzzle base to it.  Not only must you solve on how to make your cures effective while mitigating side effects but you must also work out factory logistics to make your factory run efficiently.  Getting things to run efficiently is the harder part in my opinion, since you can pause the game to research your cure development steps.  Modable, no need to say more.All in all I really enjoy it.  It has the right amout of difficulty to frustrate the hell out of you and make you want to come back over and over to try to solve that pesky logistical problem so you can make as much money as possible.  Believe me I have quit several times in my short play time to give my mind the time to solve the problems while not actually sitting and playing.  Damn you money, I want more. "

In other words - it has longetivity.We're not talking about the next ""Rollercoaster tycoon"" here or anything, but I do recommend this game.			"

Then I realised contraceptive cream is the best ♥♥♥♥ing thing ever, coz the guy get's to rub it in ;)			"

												I wish I had bought Factorio instead of this! ... I bought both in the end. You will be hugely disappointed with this if you've played Factorio.Good:-Idea is great! Everyone can relate to drugs and pharmacies at least on some level. You will realise that curing is not profitable, treating is.-Graphics look very pretty!-What has been implemented, has been implemented quite well.Bad:-Very shallow in depth and repetitive. There isn't that much to do. Pretty much all incredients are treated in the same way each time, through the same machines. Only slight variations and you will end up with pretty much the same machines each time. It is a VERY linear game.-Space is very limited, so you cannot build exactly what you want. So building becomes more like a puzzle of space rather than just puzzle of machinery complexity.-""Artificial"" AI enemy. You cannot see their factory and their numbers are taken out of a ""table"" rather than from an actual situation.Reason for not recommending: it is just not worth the premium price tag. It is definitely not worth £18.99. It is more like a £4.99 game, even that is pushing it.			"

												I've been playing Big Pharma via a non-Steam version and have been really enjoying it. I'd played at least a dozen hours before the 1.0 release and have been very please with how the developer has not only been regularly updating the game, but also responding to community inputs and making changes based on them.I'd have to say that it's partly a puzzle game, in that you have to build assembly lines that require some planning and tinkering to fit them in the available space and also to spend as little money as possible. And you have to research more efficient (abet more costly) production machines that take up less space.It's also a business sim, in that you buy resourses, process them and then produce a product. This is done very well in the game because you don't have to stare at spreadsheets, instead you can just mouse over the production lines or your company page and the appropriate info is right there. And it's very easy to understand where you are making and losing money, in fact I'd say that this game is one of the best examples of how to make a business sim right.And the other nice feature that I like is that the game is composed of a number of scenarios/missions, most of which have three different levels of victory, and you don't have to unlock any particular mission to play any other of them. Plus there's also a custom game mode, where you can alter all sorts of criteria and conditions, and a free build mode where you can just make assembly lines and geek out on that.The game is very polished and glitch and bug free. I very much recommend it.			"

												This game is fun if you are into a cross between business simulation and puzzle games.  You have to fit the machines into tight spaces, trying to best utlitze the space given.  It's not always so easy especially when doing more advanced drugs that require a lot of space.I have played this game since pre-steam alpha stages and have put quite a few hours into it. (Probably more than I care to admit.)  It is fun and challenging at times. It can get a bit repetitious at times, but still a very good game.  The developer has put a lot of time into making this game and he really cares about his product.			"

												I'm actually stoked. This reminds me of theme hospital, but this game is very tricky. It beomes very complicated and requires a well thought out plan. It's really fun challenge and yet it can give you a bit of headache if you are a perfectionist. This game is for thinkers and if you are one of them, you will love the challenge and the game.			"

												Big Pharma does a decent job at what it sets out to do. However, I absolutely cannot recommend this game to consumers at the $25 price point that it is currently at. This game would be 100% solid at the $10-12 price point, but it is simply not good value for your money at $25.See my first impressions and thoughts here:

												Big Pharma isn't a bad game, but I just didn't have much fun with it. It seems like a game designed for someone who is a little OCD and enjoys the process of meticulously optimizing a production line. For me, the game kept me engaged but felt more like work than fun.Pros:+ The game looks good and is pretty polished.+ The mechanics are fine and sensible. The game is very playable.+ The game does require a lot of strategy. There is a definite puzzle element that might appeal to some people.Cons:- If you want to go beyond simple competence in the game, it requires some heavy-duty number crunching and space optimization. This feels like a game where the right way to play it would involve lots of spreadsheets and things.- The game lacks a story or structure to keep it engaging. You work hard to meet a meaningless goal. Then, once you finally beat a level, your work was for nothing and you just go to the next level--which is pretty much the same as the one before it. I did not find the payoff for my hard work to be worth it.			"

												Big Pharma is a game that I had no idea existed until it showed up on Something Awful. I didn't have high expectations, but this is one of the best games I've played all year. The scenarios escalate nicely so that just when you think you have a handle on everything, it gets a bit more complicated. You can also feel like the capitalist everyone hates by trying to shove your competitors out of the market through aggressive patent holding, flooding the market so it's not profitable for them to stay in, or agressive outsourcing and PROFIT. Go forth and organize your production lines in the name of profit!			"

												Big Pharma is a very refreshing take on factory building that offers genuine satisfaction for coming up with the best production line you can think of.  Where similar games get by overloading with content and chaos--more things to build, higher volume, etc, Big Pharma rewards for elegant solutions.  It isn't about how much you produce.  It's about how you produce it.For simplicity's sake, I will contrast Big Pharma with Factorio, which I also got a lot of enjoyment from.  Factorio is about managing resources and logistics--incredibly large numbers of exceedingly simple tasks that combine to create hectic situations.  The entire game (Factorio) can be summed up as deciding what you want to make, then ensuring the right buildings are getting the right amounts of all requisite materials in a massive and complicated chain involving dozens of buildings.  All gameplay revolves around that.Big Pharma is absolutely nothing like that; rather, it is about design and decision making.  Where Factorio gets complicated, Big Pharma is merely complex.  In Big Pharma, you can make whatever sort of cure you like.  Expensive or cheap, whether you earn or lose money is determined by *how* you chose to make the product and whether it was a wise choice to make it at all considering demand, competition, and your current capabilities.  You can make crazy wonder drugs and lose money with a hasty production line a la Factorio, or you can put some thought into it and make millions.  The same applies to the cheap drugs.  Maybe you even allow a minor, negative side effect in the product to ensure economic viability.  It's up to you to determine what the right move is, and when you make that right move, you get genuine satisfaction out of it that games like Factorio are simply incapable of matching.I am not saying that Big Pharma is better than Factorio.  I got a lot more time out of Factorio than I did from Big Pharma.  But I do believe the time I spent with Big Pharma was more enjoyable and satisfying, which is quite fitting.  Production in Factorio is all about volume, and production in Big Pharma is all about quality and substance.  This mirrors my gameplay experience with the two games quite nicely.			"

												if you like logic/assemble puzzle games AND economy sims this one might be what you were looking for.extremly easy to learn... but damn hard to master.quiet a good selection of scenerios, freeplay mode and custom scenario included rounds up an excellent game.a scenario takes you about 30min to a couple of hours to complete - so its definitivly not a game for in between, but it wont eat away all your free time - unless you chose to :Dbad things last: the starting of each game is a little random and competitors can kill you off with patents if you dont pay to much attention, but as a scenario doesnt take to much time : restart is always an option.so make your own happy pill and enjoy...

Someone can say it is repetitiv, and it is but that doesn't mean it's not fun. If this is not kind of game you like it can get boring after few hours, but there are to many goals and that feeling when you complete something with master rank after few crashes is just awesome.  And when you finish the ""story"" (I mean pre-built scenarios) you can make your own or just play sandbox with infinite space and money.

												I  was hoping this would be a lot like Free Enterprise, only without the glitches. However, it is far more puzzle heavy than sim/strategy/management.

Cons:- Conveyor belt routing is a time waster, but not totally miserable.- Initially have to reference a fair amount of material hoping back and forth between tabs, making it more like work than a game.- Once you memorize the tech tree and how the different components work, it becomes a logic/routing/adding/subtracting exercise. It isn't what I think of when I think sim/strategy/management.

												Very polished game, continuously challenges you to optimize products further. The end game is complex enough to allow you to solve the layout & efficiency puzzles in multiple ways, but still comprehensible enough to play while tired or not completely sober.The game feels pretty complete, haven't found any obvious bugs. But despite randomization of factory layout & ingredient effects, it still lacks a bit in replay value in my opinion. Certainly gives you a few days worth of puzzle/simulation/micromanagement fun. It seems that there is no new content planned though, which is a shame.Might not be worth €20, but I'd certainly recommend to pick it up during a sale. "

												Played for a bit, kinda fun but it gets stale after a bit. Oh, and when I exit the game my screen goes black and I cannot get my computer to come back without power cycling. Lucky for me, I happened to be half way through a Forza Horizon 3 download when it happened. It restarted at zero out of 50gb. Rage-uninstalled Big Pharma immediately.			"

												Big Pharma is worth a buy if it's on sale and as long as you are not expecting a Theme Hospital-like experience.The game is more space-management and puzzle solving than hospital/business simulation.There is a lot of content. Plenty of missions that require quite a bit of effort to complete.I had fun playing through the first dozen missions but don't feel the  motivated to push onward.If puzzles are your thang, pull the trigger. If you want to cure patients and expand your facility in fun and creative ways, this isn't what you're looking for.			"

												A tycoon/simulator game where you build production lines for medicine. There is no story mode/campaign but rather many scenarios that require you to reach a certain objective (like a target revenue) within a time limit.You start with an open area and have to build production lines for medicine. You start with a vent on the wall to import raw ingredients, pass it through several processing machines to refine and produce the medicine, then end with a vent on the wall to export the completed product. There are a variety of machines and you'll have to make decisions on how to make your medicine. There are tradeoffs in space, manufacturing speed, profit, and quality of medicine based on which and how many machines you use. Also, there is a research system in place that requires you to invest money to eventually unlock more ingredients, machines, and other bonuses,Certain things could be better polished/presented:The tutorial could be better- it's just one long scrollable text box. I would've liked a tutorial that was properly divided into separate windows for each step and with UI focus (like highlighting/pointer arrows, etc.) on what is being talked about. It's not too hard to learn if you've played similar games or have a knack with understanding program UI but the tutorial could use some polishing up.At first glance it seemed that there were only 4 columns of challenges but one day I was surprised when my mouse cursor wandered to the right edge of the screen and it scrolled a little. There's no reason to move your mouse all the way to the right (you can hover over the right-most challenges without scrolling the screen)Sometimes it's hard to click on a specific thing (like vents to change ingredients or to delete specific tiles of that are partially hidden behind things). It's due to perspective but there has to be some way to better select objects in the back. You have to click on a certain area for vents that you'll have to learn by experience.There are a couple UI changes I would have liked:To have a dedicated area to see current active events. I couldn't find the details anywhere after I dismissed the event box. After a while you can manually check the graphs for the changes but it would still be a nice addition.To toggle ingredient icons while zoomed out (normally, all icons disappear). I liked to use the icons to figure out which areas are making which product (which is useful when you want to change production).To find the location of your product line by clicking on the product in your company tabTo display the amount of ingredient currently being used in the upgrade tooltip (like the machine upgrade tooltip). This would let you know at a glance which ingredient you're using a lot (so how much the upgrade would benefit you).'Auto pause and focus' is nice but it will sometimes not work if you've currently opened another event window. Your product line (and its revenue) will stop completely while it waits for you to name a product so the product naming window should really always pause and force you to deal with it (Or the product should keep selling under the generic name until you name it).Personally, I would've liked a campaign or scenarios with personalities and scripted events to make things interesting. A little story to link things together helps keep my interest when doing multiple playthroughs of the same thing. The sandbox is fun for a while but it's not like The Sims where it's easy to make your own story in the sandbox. I had fun doing a few challenges and then went straight to a custom game with all tier levels unlocked to get the full experience.Worth a look if you like sandbox tycoon games and refining your strategy through multiple playthroughs.

												Unplayable on MacBook Air Late 2010. Although I seem to  meet the requirements. Welcome Screen sluggish. As soon as I build one machine, it slows down immensely. Great game on other platforms. Please adjust minmum requirements on website. Bought it because I wanted to play it on my macbook... cant recommend the game for that. If you have a stronger platform, buy it.Edit: Thank you Brico. Right you are. By no means did I want to bash this game. That's why I wrote ""If you have a stronger Platform, buy it."" I do not recommend this game for the purpose I bought it for. Tht is all I said. The game itself is great. Second point I wish to clarify: MacBook Late 2010 is quiet  great when it comes to gaming. PolyBridge... similar level of graphics is quiete playable. Hell... there is even a low level graphics patch for Cities Skylines. Portal 2 is working as well. And I do have the feeling, that Big Pharma would work too reading the different comments in the communities and comparing the specs with other laptops.Third Point: Do please check your facts before you insult hardware. The poor things like MacBooks, SNES and my old GameBoy cant defend themselves. My poor MacBook is now sulking in a corner... the discrete graphics adapter has gone to the nearest pub, upgrading itself with an intolarable amount of tequila. While this is going on, I do not have discrete graphics.  Fourth whatever @ Binnes: Yes I am playing games on my Mac. I played games on my 8086, on my CPC464 etc. I like playing games. Fifth: No Bootcamp. If I want to play under WIndows... I use a PC.Sixth: Going sulking now. Thinking about joining my graphics adapter.Gonna change the recommendation because I am kind of spineless and cant't stand the hassle of you guys.			"

												4GB memory is not enough to play the game.  After about 10 minutes of non-menu gameplay, my mac reaches full heat capacity, and the game freezes up, becomes clunky.  I know, I shouldn't have gotten a used mac.  I'm saving up for a gaming PC.  I just think the minimum memory requirement should be raised.  Also, why does it need so much memory?  I play plenty of games with 3d graphics, like Portal2 (no problems) and KSP (minimal problems).  With such simple concept, there should be a way to slim down the code.			"

												I expected some simulation game, but this is more of a puzzle game. Deciding what to build usually takes about 2s, but finding how is the only issue. It's kind of like playing tetris with medical equipment. The UI helps a lot into making the game seem like it's complex, while it actually really lacks depth.Research and exploration makes very little sense too. There should be a way to preselect what you want to find, and should have a way to make the game go *really* faster until something worth your time happens (which would be not often if preselection was possible), spending hours waiting for something interesting to happen isn't my idea of fun.

												I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a little bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total disappointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!The review will be constructed into 5 parts:1. Game description (from what I’ve seen in the time I’ve played).2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.3. Pros/Cons.4. Final thoughts.5. RatingSo let's begin...1. Game description:When I started this game I had expected something like Roller coaster tycoon(what I think a management game should be) but with medical drugs. I was so wrong. The graphics are on par for a management game. Nothing too special but not bad. Music and sound effects are ok and the gameplay is…well OK too. It’s nothing special and definitely not what I expected, but it’s OK for what it does. However the building part doesn’t matter too much and that’s what killed it for me. It’s a micromanagement decision making game, with a little construction thrown in.2. Did i finish the game? NOThe fact that the building portion of the game was so small made me uninstall it after the first mission. I don’t think I will be coming back to this one.3. Pros/Cons.PROS:- A pretty good management gameCONS:- Not a lot of building in it4. Final thoughts:Not my style of management game, although a lot of people will enjoy it. 5. Rating6/10 "

												A very comprehensive management/simulation/factory game that requires a lot of strategy, not only from a floor space perspective, but also for optimization of processes, a degree of cost/benefit analysis, workforce management, and some degree of business sense to be successful at the Expert level (Middle level).  I've really enjoyed this game, can't wait to continue with it, and can't wait to see what changes with it in the future.			"

												In general, I like Big Pharma, and have had fun completing some of the various challenges. The initial puzzle solving is interesting, and I enjoy trying to create the perfect drug in the space allotted. I also very much like that it is pauseable real-time, so that I can take as long as I want figuring things out.However, the game is very similar each play-through, with only minor randomness (the floor layout and the ingredients list are all that change). So once you know what works, it pretty much works every time. The computer opponents are also not so much competitors as a nuisance, as they cannot beat you, but only get in your way. The only thing you are really fighting against is the clock, and your own goals.So while I think this game is good for people who like puzzle and optimization games, it is not for everyone, I am not sure it is worth the full asking price. So if this looks interesting to you, watch for a good sale and give it a try.			"

												Original Post:Bought the game on 40% sale thinking ""oh this is a good deal"", next day turns to 80% off. Request steam refund, refuse because 6 hours played. What a **** move.New Post:Not a bad game, gets a little repetitive after a while and doesn't run like a true business sim, more of a puzzle challenge game. However, that being said the gameplay is good and certainly something both new and clean. The challenge of creating some amazing drugs in such confined spaces can really be an exciting challenge. I'm not sure about the price though, even if I did buy it on discount, it still seems quite expensive for what the game is.			"

												I picked this up on a big sale. It's probably not worth $28, but $14 sure. It's worth a good 15-20 hours of gameplay. The most frustrating thing is how difficult and finnicky it is to setup multi-feed processes. Like mixers take 2 turns to process when many other processes take 1; so you should have 2 mixers - but this becomes so burdensome to try and setup that you will quit and take the 50% slower process. There should be some kind of simple ""belt programming"" so I can say ""belt intersection alternates firing left then right"" instead of constantly trying to delete, play, delete, play, delete play; to try and time my ingredients correctly and then STILL the belts will fire in the right direction, then the wrong again. AHH! Game is a cool concept, fun to play, but a completionist/perfectionist will go mental.			"

												I was a little bit wary about this game when I first got it, but oh boy, was I pleasantly surprised! This game is positively addicting, and it has tons of fun challenges to keep you occupied for hours and hours! Definitely recommend it if you like simulation games, it has a bit of a learning curve, but once you get past it you'll have fun designing intricate assembly lines for hours. Not the most complicated in terms of what you can actually do, but still plenty charming and fun!The one gripe I have with this game is that the interface is a little bit unintuitive. I think they were going for a kind of minimalist thing, but it'd be much nicer if my eyes didn't have to scan past inches and inches of blank space to find what I needed to see. It'd be cool if they put the Production tab and the Ingredients tab into one interface, because it feels kind of bloated otherwise. Still, a very minor criticism for an otherwise fun and addictive game!			"

												See what it feels like to be Martin Shkreli, in this pharmaceutical company management sim, ... well maybe not. In Big Pharma you do manage a pharmaceutical company but it's more of a puzzle game with management elements. Big part of the gameplay is placing various machines that increase or decrease concentration of ingredients or mix them up and finally turn them into pills or creams or syringes. All these machines have different input and output locations and often sizes, you also need to add conveyor belts and with limited amount of space and doors through which ingredients can enter and leave your factory creating a new drug becomes, well a puzzle. Besides planning your factory you'll send explorers in search of new ingredients and researchers to invent new types of machines or improve existing ones. You can play in free mode or one of many challenges. What is really smart and should be adopted in other games is that the challenges get progressively more complex. And I don't mean that the competition gets tougher or you are hit with arbitrary debuffs. The game actually limits your research tree and ingredient list to only present you with simple choices. Then as you progress you are given more and more options. It's a really nice game that hits that improvement itch, you've created a cure for bad breath and now you can improve it and cure sore throat. Coming up with more and more complex recipes for more advanced cures is extremely satisfying. Dad rating: ExcellentGame can be paused at any time, giving you time to attend to the little ones. Speed can also be increased if you prefer to breeze through the more boring periods.No violence what so ever. No scary monsters jumping out on the screen either. You can safely play it with your child on your knees.I highly recommend it my 10h with Big Pharma felt like a breeze and I'm looking forward to many more. "

												Overall, great idea and solid presentation. It's really a lot of fun to build assembly lines, and to create the final product. The learning curve is a bit steep at first, but plateaus very rapidly once you figure out the couple more advanced concepts and techniques.As fun as it is to play, the one thing I fault this game with is the use of ""Challenges"" as the core game mode format; which I found to not be that engaging.This might work well for 'completionist' type players who want to achieve the highest rating for each Challenge, but I think Big Pharma would really benefit from a Civilization-type approach where you build a drug empire, interact directly with other AI Pharmaceutical companies in different ways (hostile takeovers, mergers, forcing them out of business, etc...) and strive to achieve one of multiple possible victory types, all over a fairly long period of time. Overall, definitely worth the price, but this game could be so much more with a bit more gameplay depth.			"

												I will review all my humble bundle games and see which is worth playing and which is not! Like a lot of people i buy H.B. games as a pack because i want some of the games, but not all. I will play for 5 minutes (or a little bit more) and give you my opinion on it. Sometimes the game will surprise me, sometimes it will be a total disappointment. Just keep in mind this is my opinion only and is not an objective view of the game. You might actually like it!The review will be constructed into 5 parts:1. Game description (from what I’ve seen in the time I’ve played).2. Did i finish the game (YES/NO/Maybe in the future) and why.3. Pros/Cons.4. Final thoughts.5. RatingSo let's begin...1. Game description:When I started this game I had expected something like Roller coaster tycoon(what I think a management game should be) but with medical drugs. I was so wrong. The graphics are on par for a management game. Nothing too special but not bad. Music and sound effects are ok and the gameplay is…well OK too. It’s nothing special and definitely not what I expected, but it’s OK for what it does. However the building part doesn’t matter too much and that’s what killed it for me. It’s a micromanagement decision making game, with a little construction thrown in.2. Did i finish the game? NOThe fact that the building portion of the game was so small made me uninstall it after the first mission. I don’t think I will be coming back to this one.3. Pros/Cons.PROS:- A pretty good management gameCONS:- Not a lot of building in it4. Final thoughts:Not my style of management game, although a lot of people will enjoy it. 5. Rating6/10 "

Big part of the gameplay is placing various machines that increase or decrease concentration of ingredients or mix them up and finally turn them into pills or creams or syringes. All these machines have different input and output locations and often sizes, you also need to add conveyor belts and with limited amount of space and doors through which ingredients can enter and leave your factory creating a new drug becomes, well a puzzle. Besides planning your factory you'll send explorers in search of new ingredients and researchers to invent new types of machines or improve existing ones. You can play in free mode or one of many challenges. What is really smart and should be adopted in other games is that the challenges get progressively more complex. And I don't mean that the competition gets tougher or you are hit with arbitrary debuffs. The game actually limits your research tree and ingredient list to only present you with simple choices. Then as you progress you are given more and more options. It's a really nice game that hits that improvement itch, you've created a cure for bad breath and now you can improve it and cure sore throat. Coming up with more and more complex recipes for more advanced cures is extremely satisfying. Dad rating: ExcellentGame can be paused at any time, giving you time to attend to the little ones. Speed can also be increased if you prefer to breeze through the more boring periods.No violence what so ever. No scary monsters jumping out on the screen either. You can safely play it with your child on your knees.I highly recommend it my 10h with Big Pharma felt like a breeze and I'm looking forward to many more. "

												This game is based on logic puzzles, but it also contains an intuitive tech tree, there is a market you should investigate from time to time, money administration is also quite important.This game succesfully mixes all those aspect in one. Maybe it's not the best game you can buy, but at least for me it's absolutely OK.			"

												So first off: this game has a lot of polish. this is a well-done game.  the UI is slick, the mechanics are new (to me) and interesting.maybe I'm being too picky, but I take umberage with how they implemented the belts - and for a game that hinges on logistics, belts are important. they have frustrating logic, trying to 'predict' your intentions. Basically you should only be placing belts as the final step, and even then dragging from point A to B is the most efficent path, but not if you want to tuck into that space later - also if you're in a rush, you're more likely to place a t-junction that halts an entire  production line, and there is no attention grabbing 'hey you broke x'. I apologize for offering criticism without an alternative, but all I can think of is more fine-grained control.if you like a good puzzle game / business sim with some depth (the ingredients and researching and upgrades are a nice touch) and don't mind looking past some frusting flaws (or are more forgiving/patient than I) then this could be hours of enjoyment for you.as it is, 20$ for a game that will end with ME needing blood pressure medication? I'll pass.			"

												Buggy game.Imagine you have a really efficient system, and a nice long machine, connecting each part to another in perfect harmony. You then add a machine that slows down the process slightly, and although you're limited by space, you see a small opportunity to add in another machine to help increase profits.You spend the last of your money getting everything in place, then connect it all with belts. Suddenly, everything but your new addition grinds to a halt, as it turns out one of the belts in the new T-junction you've created is trying to move in the opposite direction.You scratch your head, thinking ""but there's an input and an output... why can't it see which way to go? Everntually, you contact the developer, who says ""It's literally impossible to fix this""... You then realise that the developer simply doesn't know how to fix this bug, and therefore calls it a feature, telling people not to use T-Junctions, even though they limit the space provided, and encourage you to connect machines together and utlise space as best as possible.It's a nice game, and certainly a time sink, but whomever designed the belts system needs to go back and do them again. Especially as they're the most used object in the game.It's not going to happen though... as the developer refuses to admit there's a problem, despite the number of people arguing their point.For that reason alone, it's not recommended. You'll find yourselves more frustrated than entertained.			"

												From the description the game ought to scratch my tycoon/sim game itch thoroughly, with some interesting spatial puzzles and potentially moral dilemmas thrown in - but unfortunately the reality was a dry, uninspiring game with no real direction. The humour of classics like Theme Hospital is ditched in favour of a quasi-realism that doesn't really hit the mark, whilst a complete lack of story or characters ensures the game has as little heart as the big pharma companies it emulates.Heh, maybe that was the point.

For instance, the 2nd tutorial teaches you how to upgrade your drug, except the option to upgrade is no where to be seen. Same for the rest of the tutorials, none of them match with what you're supposed to see.

They don't break down, you can change the speed of the belt to meet demand, and overal there is a lack of what I feel is control over your own factory.  Your just the simple caretaker do a one time set of step and then done no tweaking or challenge.  Even though its on sale for roughly $8 dollars at the moment I would still not recomment it.			"

												Big Pharma is essentially a game where you are able to spend your money on parts such as ""evaporators"" and ""dissolvers"" in order to create new medications that will essentially give you more money, to spend more parts, to get more money, to spend new parts etc. This game has an endless cycle of ""spending money on parts"" and ""gaining more money"", just like the games ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" and ""Holy Potatoes! A Weapon Shop?"". Other than giving specific goals to reach, such as gaining $1,000,000 in revenue in 10 years, this game really has no point other than to keep you in the ""endless cycle"", which is why I cannot give it a ""thumbs up"".However, If you are the type of person who loves these kinds of games, then I will tell you that there are many aspects to consider, including:-Research-Finding new Ingredients-Getting Loans when your bankrupt (which many games do not allow you to do)-Upgrading standard Migraine Pills to something even better-Upgrading Equipment-Competitor Companies (AI companies, not multiplayer)Even though Big Pharma is not my preferred cup of tea, it may be of interest to people who like the game I just described above.Happy Gaming-Matt			"

												The idea is nice. It's a puzzle- management game. But it's to buggy. There are many frustrating flaws: layovers not functioning and other small inconveniences. Besides that last update corrected placing machines so they needed a belt in between which made placement a lot less efficcient. So get rid of the bugs  and it will be a lot better. "

												If you are looking for a game to create big factories and intricate production line go play Factorio. I bought this since I thought it might be fun, but it is not - there is no real challenge to the gameplay. It just feels annoying that each machine has different in and output ports that make building a space-efficient factory an impossibility. Also the economy is a joke - it's practically impossible to not turn a profit which makes the whole part of the game trivial.It feels like a nicely presented iPad game - but won't entertain for more than 1-2 hours after which the mixing and upgrading part of the game gets repetitive and annoying (due to the factory building shortcomings).

												I bought this game for 5 bucks. Thought it was a steal but I still ended up asking for a refund. Now I cannot say that all will share my experience. But this game was far too complex for me. I got frustrated playing the tutorial. A tutorial which encouraged me to create the requested result ""In my own way."" to just ""make sure the end result is the same."" I did this several times throughout my 4 hour playtime. Eventually I gave in and just copied exactly as it was in the pictures (as far as layout) and what do you know, It worked. However, the end resulting drug that was created was the EXACT same drug I created with my layout. As I stated in the begining, this may just be my own fault. This game may be too smart for me. But I feel that if your tutorial contains grammatical errors and lack luster instructions to say the least, it makes it a bad time universally. To its credit, it's very robust. Tons of scenarios and modes to play with. It's just that the game is not fun.			"

												This game has real promise and potential! Great graphics and fun concept. Sadly the execution is a little lacking. Specifically, the whole 'upgrade' thing feels really wrong. I upgrade by using the same concentrator? Why doesn't it automatically upgrade when at the correct concentration? It's very clunky, doesn't feel natural and in the end is what caused me to quit this game, never to open it again. Not sure why this wasn't caught in beta :(			"

												Not much of a tycoon game, more of a puzzle game. I found it very confusing, and not fun. It kind of reminds me of a cross between Pipe Dreams and The Incredible Machine. I'm not really much of a fan of puzzle games in general, and I almost flunked Chemistry in high school. This game doesn't really do it for me.But if you're looking for something really tricky and complicated with hundreds of moving parts, you'd probably like it. I was hoping for more management / business type stuff and there are elements of that here, but the main goal is to figure out how to make X, Y, and Z by combining A with B, then adding some S and P, subtracting N, performing the square root of J and inputting that as the coefficient of C to get D.

												My wife is the COO of a pharma company and this has next to nothing to do with what she does. Not a pharma simulator! 1-star.This is actually a factory simulator and oftentimes pharm companies outsource the manufacturing. Well, honestly there are two main kinds of pharma companies and her company is actually a drug discovery type. She doesn't produce the generic types; she produces the new drugs. This game has nothing to do with that and that was disappointing for me.Ultimately, the game became boring about halfway through the tutorials. Sad.			"

												Great Game. I installed it. Though I’d only play the tutorial levels then a few hours later. I’d spent most of the day playing I been a while since I have done that with any game.A mix of strategy and micro management. Then you get to later levels and the game falls Apart and becomes a steaming pile of crap.			"

												This game has a very interesting concept, balancing both business simulation and logistics planning, making this one of the deepest and most challenging tycoon game yet. The random generation also allows for more challenging scenarios and replayability, but is also one of the downsides to the game, considering business simulation and RNG tend to dislike each other. I'm not far through the game yet, but it is starting to get repetitive, as most missions can be completed by the same general business strategy of ""upgrade and expand as much as possible"". Controls, UI, and other gameplay elements are handled well, so there's not much to say about that. Rating:7/10 Not a bad game at all, but I suggest getting it for a lower price due to the repetitive nature of its gameplay.			"

												It's easy to see that the developers have tried hard to make a good game based on a new idea. And they have gone 95% of the way, but the games still feels like a beta version of the real game. The controls are clumsy: you move around with the same right button as you sell; switching between tabs takes so much time, although you do it all the time; I still try to push escape to get to the main view (because it's natural!), but only get to the menu; the default building hotekys are on the numeric keyboard (do you think everyone has it?) and I still haven't found a hotkey for belts.At the same time, the gameprocess is overloaded by messages and different areas in which your attention is required, which doesn't let you focus on something in particular, but always distracts you. The analysis of market is not well presented, so it's hard to understand what is the best course of action at the moment. Finally, fitting your equipment in the factory is interesting the first two minutes, but then you are kind of tired playing tetris and are more interested in concentrating on more important stuff, but nope, you cannot. And if you want to double your production you cannot copy a segment of your conveyor, but have to rebuild it againg with all the connections, which feels like a complete loss of time.This game is a good try and may become something good in the end, but for the moment it is largely overpriced (I wouldn't pay more than 5$ for it) and in my opinion needs large sales and an army of beta-testers to make it playable for more than two hours. So be aware: for the moment this game is not what you expect. But it still has a change to become a good one.			"

												I've had Big Pharma for a while now; I bought it when it wasn't on steam (A few months before the release) and have gotten a pretty solid idea on the game.Graphics: Simple 2nd Dimensional, isometric camera view. All the machines have nice animations, and the customization of your building, albeit basic with flooring and wall paper, add a bit of hominess and individuality to your lines.Sound: Not much to say. The music is nice and the sound effects are good, but far from breaking any records. Gameplay: Big Pharma is a building game, a puzzle game, and a business management game. You pick ""play"" and you are presented with a wide varity of missions. These range from ""produce X amount of treatment for X"" to ""Make a profit of X dollars."" What is great is that you are able to approach this however you want; the game doesn't force you to follow specific paths. You get to build whatever manufacturing lines you'd like to produce medications. It gives a feeling of freedom, compared to other games where they hold your hand and demand you do things in a certain order, and more or less penalize you for differentiating. Each effect requires a bevy of actions first. To get treatment for X, first you must set the concentration to the right values with machines like the evaporator and ioniser. You may need to combine it with a catalyst effect- Which comes with other symptoms too, so you have to figure out what to do with the biproduct too. Along with keeping a functioning line running, you need to keep a mind for space conservation- each exspansion of your building takes money, and they aren't too roomy. Along with making sure your lines work and you have enough space, you need to keep an eye on your competitors; developed a wondercure for a very exspensive symptom? Soon, the AI competitors will rush to roll out those medications and steal some of your profits. Multi-tasking is a critical part of the game, and if you will have a bad time if you're only good at focusing one thing at a time. Another great feature is the hands-on tutorial. It lays down the foundation you need to understand the game and get a business running, but is entirely skippable if you chose.Overall, Big Pharma is a great game if you're into the business management economic simulator genre of games.

												Big Pharma is a nice combination of puzzle solving, business simulation and floor planning. I have not come across any other game which manages to combine all these facets of gameplay and still remain interesting.The game offers you so many opportunities to optimize your designs, production layouts, pricing, research that I only seem to unpause the game when I run out of money. However, once you start making some serious money in a few years, you can just get caught up in designing the perfect drug for each disease and then creating the production layout for it in tight factory spaces. Some reviewers have mentioned that drug designing is a simple matter of increasing or decreasing the concentration but I think that those players have not yet discovered other aspects of drug designing which really compel you to look at all the possibilties and then create that Viagra-like drug that will change the world!The best part, perhaps, is that all these complexities offer value to those players who wish to indulge in them. If you just want to keep it simple, you can easily make enough money by just producing simple generic drugs.			"

												A lot of fun for people who enjoy building and improving their ""mousetraps"" (which I greatly enjoy.)  The many challenges of the game are fun and rewarding to try and beat on Master level.  Good tutorial to help you jump in pretty quickly, a little heavy on the reading if you're not into that sort of thing, but if you're not, you're probably not gonna wanna play a drug-making simulator anyway.Marketing and Malpractice DLC added TREMENDOUS depth and enjoyability (and replayability) to the game.  Having a ton of fun with it.One of my most profitable drugs was in high demand, and cheap to make but had bad side effects.  When I tried to make it more helpful to the populace in general, it ended up being not as profitable and I had to chuckle about the irony of that compared to real life (something I think the game designers intended to represent.)  However my competitors started manufacturing better versions of the drug and stealing all my sales.  So naturally I did what every good pharma company would do: patented my crappy version so that they couldn't sell their (economic infeasible) versions and steal my sales.10/10 would make money at the expense of human health and well-being again			"

												I really enjoy Big Pharma since you have to build enough machines to make the drug you make effective without breaking the bank. The tutorials are great and you can spend hours making your own drug with different side effects and cures, which adds to replayability. One gripe is that it takes a while for you to go from no money to making money at first, but after a while it's okay.I do find that it's a hit or miss depending what you like. If you like puzzles, making pharma drugs, and buisness all in one, go for it or else you may have to skip. Like I said it's a hit or miss.			"

												Awesome - nothing less!Factory building old-fashion style, with plenty of depth and randomness to add replayability!Ressources are random with effects and range, floor and new rooms are with random size and ports and to remove/upgrade drugs, you have to plan well ahead.Basicly you get a ressource and then add/decrease strength to hit a target range. Then if you want to upgrade an effect or remove a side effect, run it through a specific machine, some times add a component. The further you go, the deeper and more complex it getsTutorials are not super, but does the job well, most of the interface and gameplay is with a good layout, so it seems logicalFirst play was almost 2 hours that went by way to easy :D			"

												Tons of play time for only $25.00. Outstanding value for money if you're into this type of game. The time and effort spent on details, gameplay, and features really shows. This game is beautiful and it runs like butter on my very old 32-bit XP box (3GHz Athlon 64 X2 CPU, 4GB of DDR2 RAM), Radeon 6700-series video).[Edit] Revision to the above. The game has crashed 4 times, once with an actual ""The game has crashed""  dialog (creating a crash dump folder which I emailed to the developer), and 3 times it just locked up solid at various points., forcing me to Ctrl+Shift+Esc into Task Manager to kill the process. In fairness, It's possible that the problem may lie with my aging hardware.Things I like:1. Great combination of puzzle/strategy/simulation. Min/maxers will *love* this game!2. Except for entering your company name and custom names for your saves (both of which are optional), game can be played entirely with the mouse.3. So nice to have a ""sandbox"" mode to just goof around in as well as create your own levels/puzzles.4. Also nice to be able to build/remove/adjust while paused.One nit: As with many such real-time simulation games, there can be lengthy periods of ""sit back, watch, and wait"" but the visuals of your factory alleviate that somewhat.

												This game is a unique blend of big-picture simulation and puzzle like supply chain management that I think anyone who likes sim or puzzle games should look into. I definitely recommend it on sale to a fan of either genre.  Otherwise, it is more of a niche game than I thought it would be, which makes it tough for me to recommend to the average gamer.  I followed this game since the first dev vlogs came out, then bought it in the beta phase, and for me there was just enough that the game did well that made it worth me supporting it before release.Pros:+ Supply Chain Management Tycoon: This is something unique that it does very well regarding drug creation/production. If you're not into Sim and Puzzle type games, then think twice before buying the game.+ Scenario Variety and Customization: Dozens of scenarios of varying difficulties with the ability to create your own.+ AI / Competition: I didn't find competing companies to be unrealistically hard or easy. With 3+ competitors, innovation to different drug types are imperative.+ Macro management (other than supply chain): Dev explicitly stated that the game wasn't designed for micro managing a pharmacy company. Big picture management is done well though with plenty of Research & Development opportunities, and it doesn't bog you down with price management or small stuff.+ Subtle ethical decisions: Some people wanted to be hit over the head with this, but again, it seemed secondary in the eyes of the dev. The decisions currently come in the form of...Do I leave this side effect or weak cure as is because my profit will be higher? Do I stop production on a drug that is still in demand just to move on to higher level cures with larger profits? Do I ""research"" corporate espionage in order to see my competitors' profit margins, etc?Cons:-Incentiveize the game play loop: There's 3 completion levels for each scenario indicating how well the player did, but that, scenario uniqueness, or making a specific type of drug (e.g. hair growing male enhancement drug) seems about it for replay motivation.-Starting drug RNG (may be fixed): I've read about a number of players restarting scenarios until their initial unlocked drug combo was ideal. This may be more of a player min/maxing issue, and I think a patch meant to address this, but I don't know how well this helped.-Micro management (by design): As mentioned above, the game wasn't designed for that, and this may bug some people. Just supply chain and big picture stuff is what is mostly in this game.			"

												Big Pharma is a great little game in which you get to play as the big pharmaceutical companies, create drugs, sell them and build up reputation.The game is in essens a puzzle game with some light management thrown in for good measure. Most of the gameplay is creating drug chains that optimizes drugs (for profit or usefulness) and then to sell them. Which is really a really satisfying puzzle game. All of the machines that create drugs have a different shape and size and in order to fit them all in you either need to plan out what you'll need ahead of time, because moving production lines after they are completed is really difficult, alternatively you can buy smaller more effective machines, however those will crank up the production cost for the drug, directly affecting your bottom line.The game is great in that you can create really weird drugs that may or may not actually work, but after all it's all about making money and not drugs right? You will need to decide wheater you value space efficiency vs price, what research should you prioretize. All the while trying to stay ahead of the competition which have just patented your new drug formula rendering the giganormous production line you just created, worthless...It's a great little zen game where once in a while you sit back and just wait for your drugs' ratings go up or down, accumulate money etc. Contemplating weather or not it's the right time to expand, what you should expand into, is it worth optimizing that one cure so that its drug rating goes up...There's almost always something to do, at least in the beginning and then the game zens out after a while.One bad thing about the game however is that when you get to a sort of ""critical mass"" you basically cannot lose, except  for deadlines. There's not really too many challenges after the initial ones, because when you manage to get enough drugs to sell, you will start making tons of money and the game really turns into a fine tuning game. I'm not saying it isn't  fun at that point, but it really doesn't require as much baby sitting.On the other hand that might be exactly what you're looking for as you can then sit and maybe catch up on a series, Youtube etc.All in all, it's a nice little game, especially if you can get it in a sale, great if you need something to stimulate that gamer part of the brain as you catch up on videos or whatever. I for one can't just sit and do one thing at a time, so this is a great game for me. :)			"

												I played this game quite a bit in pre-Steam alpha - I recommend this game only to those who enjoy puzzle games, I'd say it's worth it if you can get it on sale for 10 bucks or less. If you are looking for a tycoon/management game, this is not it.------I was originally intrigued because it reminded me a bit of Theme Hospital, which - like most Bullfrog games, I loved - but this doesn't play like a tycoon game, or a management game. It's more of a puzzle game. Think Tetris where you have to research the different pieces. This game cries out for a sandbox mode... where you can build a room, build an import, layout your machinery, then build an export - use the funds to research/innovate/explore etc - enlarge your factory, add more production lines, make more money, stay ahead of the competition. Instead you get numerous scenarios in which you have to gain an arbitrary amount of money and/or create a specific type of medicine by a certain date and/or before the competiton. The game itself is that you fit your production line into a predetermined amount of space. The ingredients must be researched and require various amounts of machines (which must also be researched) to get them into medically effective states. Your work out the logistics to make it all fit. Rinse, repeat. Personally, I dislike scenario games like this; any game where I'm asked to spend time building something only to leave it all behind and start again from scratch level after level, wears thin on me rather quickly.That said, the game is extremely well made in terms of quality, the UI has been streamlined and overall it's very solid. This dev knows what they're doing, and I look forward to more of their work.			"

												This is one of those games that you'll end up playing for hours without even realizing it. It seems simple in premise at first: use your machines to make cures. When you factor in belts, space restrictions, research/exploration and side effects, it quickly becomes quite complex. Thus it is more ""puzzle"" than ""simulation"" but it's entertaining, fun, and engaging. Hopefully, the developer decides to add more content in the future, or even make a sequel.			"

However, it also ties into the management size - can you make the drugs without them turning a loss instead of a profit? And do you let side-effects in to save money?* Management: Balancing the books, making profit from the drugs, and balancing research and exploration for new ingredients.The developer also seems to be continuing to support the game, having released an update recently to make the UI alittle better, and balance the game more.In short, I don't think it'll be everyone's cup of tea, but for me, its been grand and fun.

												This is a puzzle/logistics game that dives into the economy/politics side of drug companies.  There are various challenges to complete, with different tiers of success, ensuring you will come back to previous challenges with more experience and a better outcome.  Some examples of challenges include, deliver 200 units of hair loss product (requiring desert research and follow-up exploration and an end-game atomic sequencer) before a set amount of time, produce 6 products with a B+ rating (you can make a few extra bucks if you don't process out side-effects, but this challenge requires you to find profitable and sustainable drugs without using questionable business practices), and make as much money as possible using patents, putting out as much product with as little work as possible, and undercutting the AI businesses as much as possible!This game's business side is a little light, but is expanded on in the very affordable DLC that add new layers to the game.  I would recommend getting the DLC, but only after you try the base game.  It isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine!			"

												It's one of those games that you start over and over and over and over trying to make it better next time. Only to realize that, well, you won't. The theme of the game is, basically, building a pipeline from a start to a finish point with some machines in between to ""produce"" your pharaceuticals. The tricky part is that every type of machine has a defined input point and a defined output point, which means that if you have to put like 5 of them behind each other, you will invariably end up either in a circle or in a really bad design.Solving this is, basically, the game.Is it still fun? Surprisingly, yes it is. The graphics is cute enough to make it fun to watch that machine do its magic, and the liberty you have to make decisions is just enough to give you something to ponder. Should you scrap that low profit production line and hope that you can squeeze in the much larger one that gets you better profit? Do you have room to use three cheaper machines than one expensive one? Should you hire more scientists to make production cheaper in the long run, even though they're expensive to hire and maintain? Is it good enough to warrant the price tag? I'd say yes, but I wouldn't pay more than that.			"

												UPDATED REVIEW:I initially gave this game a negative review due to the incredible difficulty. There is an extreme learning curve here, at least for me. It took me a solid 10 hours of gameplay before I finally figured out how to complete even the 2nd beginner scenario. I will admit that I rage-quit several different times before finally getting the hang of it. Therefore, if you have little to no patience (like me), beware. This isn't the best game ever made, but it also isn't the worst. It isn't your typical ""tycoon"" game, as it requires a LOT more thought and strategy. I still wish there was a difficulty slider so wimpy me could make it a bit easier, but I would have to say that I have enjoyed my time playing. I sitll dislike that luck determines what ingredients you start off with, but I suppose this allows for a bit of replayability as no two scenarios are ever quite the same. All in all, I would recommend this game, but only on sale. The standard price seems a bit steep for what this game has to offer.NOTE: I do not own the DLC, so I can't provide any opinion on that. ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:What a shame... I really thought I would love this game. I've always been a sucker for tycoon/management games.Alas, this game is rage-inducingly difficult, and there is no difficulty setting, so you're stuck with what you have. Even more strangely, it seems that each new game is randomized so there is a bit of a luck factor involved. I can't even finish the 2nd ""begiinner"" mission (after three tries) without failing and, therefore, rage-quitting. I wonder how I would do on the advanced missions? :DTutorial is quite useless and does little to help you complete the scenarios. My company is always bleeding money while the AI companies seemingly instantly turn into millionaires. So glad I got this as part of a bundle, because I probably won't be launching it again...Not recommended. I would not buy it again if I knew then what I know now. This game has brought me no enjoyment whatsoever.			"

												If one is looking for a pretty decent strategy simulation game then they have come to the right place. although the game is suppose to be a simulation, it really is not besides the fact that you have to moderate a budget, but it does not take away from the game in anyway. the premise of the game is to research machines, and ingredents and finally use both of these together to great a drug in which can can be sold for high value, easy enough... the game is not a complex one to play and is pretty straight forward once you have completed the tutorial. although there are opponents they do not really have anything to do with you as a player except annoy you with constant updates that they have created a new drug.. although they might be smarter in later difficulties as there are patents in the game and they may use them to prevent you from developing that legendary quality drug. the only big con about the game which is not something that could be avoided was that there is no strategy in the game. its the same build set up the entire game. mass produce as many low quality drugs untill you have found catalysts and have the machines to create the next lvl tier drug then mass produce those and repeat till there is not any high lvl drugs to mass produce. money is super easy to keep flowing in so its easy to have lots of scientists and researchs to generate points to make things cheaper to operate. besides this small con the game is lots of fun if you want to just relax and play a game that is not a FPS or RTS becuase the building layouts are different in each scenario which makes it harder to set up that lane of 50 plus pieces of equipment to make the highest end tier drugs.

U need to be very smart to survive, The only thing that is really bad, is that once u become rich - u can almost destroy ur enemies by producing annecessary stuff and patenting everything, so ur enemies cant produce anything, and u starting receive enourmous profit =( but if u give ur enemies a chance, they will surely destroy u.

												If you're a fan of city builder type games, this will keep you entertained for a week or 2. It's a bit tough to grasp at first, but fun once you get it. It gets repetitive after awhile. It becomes to formulaic for mid to late game, and the end game unlocks don't do enough to spice it up and keep it going. Difficultly is med-high I think, you nearly HAVE to take a loan out to complete most missions, and there are like 50 missions. You'll be tired of the game long before you do them all. IMO do the first couple of batches to get a feel for the game, then create a custom game with settings of your choice. do recomend overall.			"

												Really quite a fun production-line game. Idk what the actual genre is called but you basically make production lines that automatically produce stuff, while you balance all the external factors.Pros:- Lots of replayability- Extremely satisfying to get your 'rooms' just right so that you can fit everything you want and make it all work.- Highly logical gameplay, very appealing for me- ChallengingCons- Feel like you should be able to remove the rival company function, playing it ""Single Player"" mode for me would be way more fun- Some of the external factors/features seem contrived and annoying rather than integral to the gameplay. I get that they're really going for the Pharma concept but still- Moments of extreme frustration when you literally need that one machine to face the other way but its orientation won't let you complete your production line...- TBH the quests/missions felt like chores and free play was just better.7-8/10, I'm hovering between 7 and 8 (not 7.5 though) as the gameplay is 8 but the mission format and other cons drag it down significantly for me.

												This game is a unique blend of big-picture simulation and puzzle like supply chain management that I think anyone who likes sim or puzzle games should look into. I definitely recommend it on sale to a fan of either genre.  Otherwise, it is more of a niche game than I thought it would be, which makes it tough for me to recommend to the average gamer.  I followed this game since the first dev vlogs came out, then bought it in the beta phase, and for me there was just enough that the game did well that made it worth me supporting it before release.Pros:+ Supply Chain Management Tycoon: This is something unique that it does very well regarding drug creation/production. If you're not into Sim and Puzzle type games, then think twice before buying the game.+ Scenario Variety and Customization: Dozens of scenarios of varying difficulties with the ability to create your own.+ AI / Competition: I didn't find competing companies to be unrealistically hard or easy. With 3+ competitors, innovation to different drug types are imperative.+ Macro management (other than supply chain): Dev explicitly stated that the game wasn't designed for micro managing a pharmacy company. Big picture management is done well though with plenty of Research & Development opportunities, and it doesn't bog you down with price management or small stuff.+ Subtle ethical decisions: Some people wanted to be hit over the head with this, but again, it seemed secondary in the eyes of the dev. The decisions currently come in the form of...Do I leave this side effect or weak cure as is because my profit will be higher? Do I stop production on a drug that is still in demand just to move on to higher level cures with larger profits? Do I ""research"" corporate espionage in order to see my competitors' profit margins, etc?Cons:-Incentiveize the game play loop: There's 3 completion levels for each scenario indicating how well the player did, but that, scenario uniqueness, or making a specific type of drug (e.g. hair growing male enhancement drug) seems about it for replay motivation.-Starting drug RNG (may be fixed): I've read about a number of players restarting scenarios until their initial unlocked drug combo was ideal.

												This game looks complex at beginning, specially tutorial which not really helpful, it's more like it was made to cover up the game simplicity.Combining ingredients (with mixer or centrifuge) can be fun or frustrating, because most of time it just matter of good positioning of the machines, sometimes I felt like I was playing tetris than a tycoon game because it is kinda similar.Making an expensive medicine doesn't always resulting a better income, most people only buy painkiller or aspirin afterall. The worst is no one buying your expensive medicine, and it happens very often if you play long enough.I thought medicine effect is random, but unfortunately once you getting hang of it, this game might be boring for you.I'm not sure is it a bug or not, sometimes market is getting saturated up to 15.000% for all medicines.Animations is great even with simple design, it looks neat and colorful, love it. Overall it's an okay game I do hope this game will get more updates, at this state it just too much for the price (original price).But, considering there are only few good tycoon games on steam this one definitely must play.

												I've had Big Pharma for a while now; I bought it when it wasn't on steam (A few months before the release) and have gotten a pretty solid idea on the game.Graphics: Simple 2nd Dimensional, isometric camera view. All the machines have nice animations, and the customization of your building, albeit basic with flooring and wall paper, add a bit of hominess and individuality to your lines.Sound: Not much to say. The music is nice and the sound effects are good, but far from breaking any records. Gameplay: Big Pharma is a building game, a puzzle game, and a business management game. You pick ""play"" and you are presented with a wide varity of missions. These range from ""produce X amount of treatment for X"" to ""Make a profit of X dollars."" What is great is that you are able to approach this however you want; the game doesn't force you to follow specific paths. You get to build whatever manufacturing lines you'd like to produce medications. It gives a feeling of freedom, compared to other games where they hold your hand and demand you do things in a certain order, and more or less penalize you for differentiating. Each effect requires a bevy of actions first. To get treatment for X, first you must set the concentration to the right values with machines like the evaporator and ioniser. You may need to combine it with a catalyst effect- Which comes with other symptoms too, so you have to figure out what to do with the biproduct too. Along with keeping a functioning line running, you need to keep a mind for space conservation- each exspansion of your building takes money, and they aren't too roomy. Along with making sure your lines work and you have enough space, you need to keep an eye on your competitors; developed a wondercure for a very exspensive symptom? Soon, the AI competitors will rush to roll out those medications and steal some of your profits. Multi-tasking is a critical part of the game, and if you will have a bad time if you're only good at focusing one thing at a time. Another great feature is the hands-on tutorial. It lays down the foundation you need to understand the game and get a business running, but is entirely skippable if you chose.Overall, Big Pharma is a great game if you're into the business management economic simulator genre of games.

I have seen people complaining about random effects on ingredients which sometimes make achieving a goal difficult, however you can see what effect the ingredient has before you discover it so it is not a big problem.Quite a lot of minor interface bugs. Also the interface is not really well designed, you have to constantly switch between multiple tabs - on the cures screen you cannot see what ingredients have this cure, on ingredients screen you cannot see what ingredients you currently import etc.			"

												Greetings.I don't specialize in writing reviews, I don't have that many hours in, so it's just a human moment / perspective from a regular gamer. A little bit to describe my playstyle: it ranges from primitive shooters to sophisticated strategies, though I do have a thing for city building / production line management games (starts with Caesar III, then onto Anno and Zeus/Pharaoh/Caesar IV, Simcity, Skylines, etc).What do I have to say about the game? It's extremely catchy. System requirements are low, price's not that high (especially if you manage to grab it during a sale like I did); the game really does remind you of Theme Hospital quite a bit. Hell, when I first saw it in my ""featured"" tab, I thought this was a remake of the series. You know, the kind when you can't exactly sell a game under its old name due to some legal issues, so this potentially looked like an Indie rework of some Theme Hospital fans. The similarity ends right there, Big Pharma has way more depth to it. I'm just going through the first stage of the tutorial but I can already see a lot of -interesting- complexities. Having said that, the game is really easy to learn. It's not a Hearts of Iron or Victoria by Paradox that you'll spend two weeks learning with constant hit-n'-miss play sessions resulting in frustration before you understand what every little button does and every tiny switch stands for.All in all, Big Pharma is exactly defined by its tags. An indie (the dev seems to respond in the hub), puzzle (gets you thinking, that's a check for a fact), strategy-management (Theme Hospital- / Tycoon Deluxe-style) with a theme that makes sense (simulation).Let's see if it manages to keep me busy long enough, I'll edit it then. <:			"

												I played this game quite a bit in pre-Steam alpha - I recommend this game only to those who enjoy puzzle games, I'd say it's worth it if you can get it on sale for 10 bucks or less. If you are looking for a tycoon/management game, this is not it.------I was originally intrigued because it reminded me a bit of Theme Hospital, which - like most Bullfrog games, I loved - but this doesn't play like a tycoon game, or a management game. It's more of a puzzle game. Think Tetris where you have to research the different pieces. This game cries out for a sandbox mode... where you can build a room, build an import, layout your machinery, then build an export - use the funds to research/innovate/explore etc - enlarge your factory, add more production lines, make more money, stay ahead of the competition. Instead you get numerous scenarios in which you have to gain an arbitrary amount of money and/or create a specific type of medicine by a certain date and/or before the competiton. The game itself is that you fit your production line into a predetermined amount of space. The ingredients must be researched and require various amounts of machines (which must also be researched) to get them into medically effective states. Your work out the logistics to make it all fit. Rinse, repeat. Personally, I dislike scenario games like this; any game where I'm asked to spend time building something only to leave it all behind and start again from scratch level after level, wears thin on me rather quickly.That said, the game is extremely well made in terms of quality, the UI has been streamlined and overall it's very solid. This dev knows what they're doing, and I look forward to more of their work.			"

												Big Pharma is a great little game in which you get to play as the big pharmaceutical companies, create drugs, sell them and build up reputation.The game is in essens a puzzle game with some light management thrown in for good measure. Most of the gameplay is creating drug chains that optimizes drugs (for profit or usefulness) and then to sell them. Which is really a really satisfying puzzle game. All of the machines that create drugs have a different shape and size and in order to fit them all in you either need to plan out what you'll need ahead of time, because moving production lines after they are completed is really difficult, alternatively you can buy smaller more effective machines, however those will crank up the production cost for the drug, directly affecting your bottom line.The game is great in that you can create really weird drugs that may or may not actually work, but after all it's all about making money and not drugs right? You will need to decide wheater you value space efficiency vs price, what research should you prioretize. All the while trying to stay ahead of the competition which have just patented your new drug formula rendering the giganormous production line you just created, worthless...It's a great little zen game where once in a while you sit back and just wait for your drugs' ratings go up or down, accumulate money etc. Contemplating weather or not it's the right time to expand, what you should expand into, is it worth optimizing that one cure so that its drug rating goes up...There's almost always something to do, at least in the beginning and then the game zens out after a while.One bad thing about the game however is that when you get to a sort of ""critical mass"" you basically cannot lose, except  for deadlines. There's not really too many challenges after the initial ones, because when you manage to get enough drugs to sell, you will start making tons of money and the game really turns into a fine tuning game. I'm not saying it isn't  fun at that point, but it really doesn't require as much baby sitting.On the other hand that might be exactly what you're looking for as you can then sit and maybe catch up on a series, Youtube etc.All in all, it's a nice little game, especially if you can get it in a sale, great if you need something to stimulate that gamer part of the brain as you catch up on videos or whatever. I for one can't just sit and do one thing at a time, so this is a great game for me. :)			"

												This game looks complex at beginning, specially tutorial which not really helpful, it's more like it was made to cover up the game simplicity.Combining ingredients (with mixer or centrifuge) can be fun or frustrating, because most of time it just matter of good positioning of the machines, sometimes I felt like I was playing tetris than a tycoon game because it is kinda similar.Making an expensive medicine doesn't always resulting a better income, most people only buy painkiller or aspirin afterall. The worst is no one buying your expensive medicine, and it happens very often if you play long enough.I thought medicine effect is random, but unfortunately once you getting hang of it, this game might be boring for you.I'm not sure is it a bug or not, sometimes market is getting saturated up to 15.000% for all medicines.Animations is great even with simple design, it looks neat and colorful, love it. Overall it's an okay game I do hope this game will get more updates, at this state it just too much for the price (original price).But, considering there are only few good tycoon games on steam this one definitely must play.

												I love this game I totally recommend it. Its not easy so examine carefully the tuturiol but you need to learn more than that.  You are making drugs from ingredients that sometimes have to be discovered by your explores. Once discovered each drug tells you wht its good for curing and you set about plycing different machines in your laboratory to adjust that drug if needed. sometimes you can mix drugs to create new cures and there are drug upgrades too for instance you can get a drug good for curing the common cold then an upgrade will be an antibiotic. A drug good for indegestion/heartburn can be upgraded to good for stomach ulcers etc. Theres plenty of scope to sell different drugs even creams. There are competotor companies. watch your money closely .			"

 DISCLAIMER: This is a first impressions review, and NOT a full review, if you want a full review, then please read better reviews then mine Big Pharma is a game developed by Twice Circled and published by Positech Games, the same people behind Gratuitous Space Battles' series, Gratuitous Tank Battles and the Democracy seriesBig Pharma throws you into the medicinal making business where you run a pharmacuetical company distributing drugs that help people whilst also making big green dollar bills. The game is both a management simulation game and also surprisingly a bit of a puzzle gameTo create a drug you first have to find the suitable ingredients, each ingredient comes with a cure, a side effect and sometimes a booster (these are usually found in other ingredients and not the same one). Through that you then can make you're drug by processing it through machinery that can mix and match to evenly balance both the cure and the side effectsThe game is fun yet challenging at the same time, and with the constant upgrades you can make more and more drugs which then can be sold on the marketHowever, the game can get repetitive and some points and it does have a steep learning curve to master the game which can put some people off, you don't have to play it the correct way (which is what free build offers you), however, it is interesting to play how the game wants you to playBig Pharma is not for everyone, me personally, I enjoy it when I play it in short bursts, however, the game is not for everyone... RECOMMENDED :)  "

												Theme Hospital's and Tetris' illegitimate love child a decade later.Mildy amusing at first, though the tutorial on mixing ingredients needs improving to make things clearer but once you've figured that out, how to remove side effects and how to control the shaker... that's it!There's not really anything more to the game after that, all further research and exploration is really just enhancements to your profit margin. If it's on sale for €5-10 it may be worth a try if you liked the Theme Park/Theme Hospital games, if it's full price then give it a miss.If you want this sort of game I'd suggest checking out Capitalism II instead, sure the graphics might be lacking but there's a lot more to the actual game itself.As for the reference to Tetris above that's what trying to squeeze in as many product lines as possible into each building is like.

												Big Pharma's an enjoyable enough game during the first few hours of play, but after you get the rythm down, it quickly loses its appeal. You spend the better part of the game just perfecting formulas for your meds and adjusting sale percentages by one or two percent on your arsenal of pills or creams. There isnt a whole lot of depth that I've seen, even the tech tree is pretty lack luster and offers you a total of maybe ten or twelve buildings total for your factory. Seriously, this game is kinda like adjusting the ph on your pool while watching your stocks bounce around on your phone.It's pretty fun though for a little while though, and some of the animations are neat, but once you scratch beyond the surface, this game lacks personality and depth. There's no real story and every game plays out pretty much the same way (maybe to add authenticity to the real world big pharma). If you're new to these sort of management/production games, this might not be a bad title for you.Unfortunately, I enjoy a bit more challenge and diversity in my logistic games. I'd been watching this one for a while and got it on sale for just under $9 and honestly I feel that was a fair price for what I got. If you're like me and play a lot of these types of games, I encourage you to check out 'Factorio' or even 'Off World Trading Company' instead.			"

After that the fun begins .There is a sandbox mode or quests in increasing difficulty. They require to chose between developing various cures, explore ingrediens, research production technologies, deal with market fluctuation by world events and competitors selling the same products. Chose between cost or space when buying equipment. Get loans wich require repay with interest, hire explorers and researchers with payroll cost. Figure out how to improve cures or make them work by mixing in other ingrediens to act as catalysts. Lots of thinking fun until becomes repetitive and boring. If ever.			"

												Big Pharma is a fantastic management and simulation game. It's an usual subject to be managing, but now that I've played the game I'm surprised that it took this long for someone to think of it!The game is a great balance of logic puzzle (in the form of making profitable drugs), business (deciding when to expand, when to invest, when to do nothing), and simulation of the pharmaceutical industry. I played this when it was first released in beta and it is a LOT better since that point, so if you read about the previous releases and weren't sure I'd suggest looking at a more recent review before deciding to buy. It's a great example of an early access game doing what you would hope: improving in the run up to release and being a better product when it gets there.Positech has a great history of supporting and developing games post-release, and I look forward to playing this game for a long time to come with more and better things to do in it.

												Big Pharma could be characterized as a procedural logic puzzle game with several random-ish elements.But that sounded a bit boring, so I'd rather call it a ""living puzzle"".Basically you got your factory gadgets, which need to face certain directions, and you connect them to each other with conveyor belts. Then you input drug ingredients from wall sockets and upgrade them along the production line. You can rotate the gadgets, but not mirror them. After you decide your production line is long enough and your drug is done, it must be processed into a pill, a cream etc. and sent back into a wall socket - then you can begin selling it!It's not a simple as it sounds, in fact I think this game is quite challenging, at least with the DLC add-on. Some people said that the base game is a bit easy, but I only played with the DLC. Every factory gadget has a processing cost when stuff moves through it. So you have to ensure your drug is cheap to make by optimizing the amount of gadgets. You can make your drug stronger and boost your sales by getting rid of side-effects or adding positive effects and boosters from other ingredients, but there are many specific logical rules in place which ensure that you will mostly have a hard time doing so.After playing a while I have to say I like this game. Somehow it balances the line between being both addictive and frustrating at the same time. The game is quite well made and balanced gameplay-wise, and I've yet to see any bugs in the game which is also a very good sign.			"

												If one is looking for a pretty decent strategy simulation game then they have come to the right place. although the game is suppose to be a simulation, it really is not besides the fact that you have to moderate a budget, but it does not take away from the game in anyway. the premise of the game is to research machines, and ingredents and finally use both of these together to great a drug in which can can be sold for high value, easy enough... the game is not a complex one to play and is pretty straight forward once you have completed the tutorial. although there are opponents they do not really have anything to do with you as a player except annoy you with constant updates that they have created a new drug.. although they might be smarter in later difficulties as there are patents in the game and they may use them to prevent you from developing that legendary quality drug. the only big con about the game which is not something that could be avoided was that there is no strategy in the game. its the same build set up the entire game. mass produce as many low quality drugs untill you have found catalysts and have the machines to create the next lvl tier drug then mass produce those and repeat till there is not any high lvl drugs to mass produce. money is super easy to keep flowing in so its easy to have lots of scientists and researchs to generate points to make things cheaper to operate. besides this small con the game is lots of fun if you want to just relax and play a game that is not a FPS or RTS becuase the building layouts are different in each scenario which makes it harder to set up that lane of 50 plus pieces of equipment to make the highest end tier drugs.

												This is the sort of puzzle/management game that will eat your time if you're a sucker for optimization.  We played this game incessantly for a while and definitely clocked enough hours for it to be worth the price tag.  This is my first experience in the genre of factory management games, so I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it was generally well-polished and difficult but fair.			"

												I like this game. If you put time into it and figure out how it works it rewards you. If you like simple games this is not for you. At start it starts kind of simple but in the mid of campain/scenarios it starts to get pretty hard and if you are not goal oriented you loose pretty fast. Ofc theres alway a bit of luck involved at the start. What kind of stuff you get to develope cures...			"

												Purchased the DLC (M&M), and played recently. I nominated the game for 2016 Steam Award ""WHOA, DUDE"", because I feel every cent spent on the game has turned into gold in every aspect. I enjoyed it a lot (150 hours so far)! It is a rare game, that is not underdeveloped, but polished. It has wide range of challenge from simple to really hard one, good sense of events, the game is updated and rebalanced, and even the DLC is adding in the manner of these values. Maybe I overhype, but this is incredible, and never seen this level of care for a game! Anyone, who likes tycoon type of games, this is a musthave. It can be played easy, it can be played complicated...really up to you. Both ways, you get unbent experience. This game is a high class standard, with no 50 EUR pricetag on it.			"

												Recently gotten within a bundle with other games, this is a nice little puzzle/logic game.The management part is minimal as all that is required is for you to complete certain objectives within a certain time frame while staying afloat with your income. Expenses comes from research, exploration, ingredients and process cost.The challenge mostly come for choosing which priority comes first as well as managing the limited space correctly.The only major Con I have with the game, is the fact that certain objectives requires the production of medecines that requires catalyst (mixing the attributes of a different ingredient), however as ingredients are generated at random at the beginning of each game, it often happens that the needed catalyst is not even available at all, thus forcing you to start over sometime half an hour in.That annoyance aside, very fun little game overall. I'd put the correct entry price at 10$ or less thought.			"

												This game is really cool. However, the developers made the process of creating ""medicine"" more like editing genes.dispte this the game machanic is easy to understand and use. combine that with an awsome array of machines to use and the funniest story ever. (the story is on the collectable steam trading cards cards you get from the game, but it's not as bad as having to go to a completely separate website to see it! *cough cough* Bungie *cough cough*)			"

												Amazing tycoon type simulator. Good gameplay, nice ""micro mini-games"" like the puzle of logistically setting up your machines, marketing choices, research of new materials and some other minor things. Good replay value, still need to beat to highest difficulty scenarios. Altough a litle bit pricey. Would recomend in sales for more than 60% of the price.			"

												This is a puzzle/logistics game that dives into the economy/politics side of drug companies.  There are various challenges to complete, with different tiers of success, ensuring you will come back to previous challenges with more experience and a better outcome.  Some examples of challenges include, deliver 200 units of hair loss product (requiring desert research and follow-up exploration and an end-game atomic sequencer) before a set amount of time, produce 6 products with a B+ rating (you can make a few extra bucks if you don't process out side-effects, but this challenge requires you to find profitable and sustainable drugs without using questionable business practices), and make as much money as possible using patents, putting out as much product with as little work as possible, and undercutting the AI businesses as much as possible!This game's business side is a little light, but is expanded on in the very affordable DLC that add new layers to the game.  I would recommend getting the DLC, but only after you try the base game.  It isn't everyone's cup of tea, but it sure is mine!			"

												This is probably one of my favorite games ever.I have a soft spot for this type of game: automation, managment, logic, conveyor belts!!! It's like Theme Hospital meets Factorio, and I've lost a lot of time to this wonderful hybrid.While the actual mechanics of the game might seem complicated, and it would appear to be that it's one of those games that you have to play for hours until you really get the hang of it, it's not like that at all! Big Pharma has a brilliantly intuitive tutorial, a clean while still visually (and audially) interesting aesthetic, and an inviting, trance-like feel to it that will likely make me forget that I even have exams to study for – but in a good way!Overall, I'd definitely give this a try, and I think it's well worth the price.

												Well, after playing this game for several hours after many years, I must say this game is an absoulute chore to play. While we you have a lot of complexity to work with, it is not at all deep. The production lines, while they could be interesting like Factorio's, instead turn to a cold calculation  rather than an interesting puzzle. The business side of things is quite tedius and uninteresting. I would only recomend this on a big (75%+) sale.			"

												This game is great! My computer doesnt even meet the minimum requirements and it runs fine and fast! I love the puzzle element and its perfect for people who like factory managment games! One suggestion though, you should be able to, or research the ability to: import items into one of those ingredient slot things, and port it out of another one somewhere else for a price, depending on the distance. This would make producing max teir products much easier.			"

												for me, it's not worth it. it's a fine game, don't get me wrong, but even after being explained the mechanics by the hard-to-understand tutorial text, and playing the game for 8 hours i still struggle every time i play. it's also hard to get a sense of what's going on in-game just by looking, and after a while all the conveyor belts and ionizers just start to bleed into this gross off-white color, and my brain cells start dying due to overexertion. i play games that are fun to play (as most people do), and big pharma is just based off of maximizing profit while minimizing space and managing time, and i thought i would like it as i did with other management games, but this is just... bad. and i have nowhere near enough time as i would need to get good at this game, and there just isn't any real potential for this game after you beat all the ""levels"" or whatever. it's pretty heinous.
