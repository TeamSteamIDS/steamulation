												I think i should write at least a short thing about this game, because it truly deserves it =)Its a kind of ""Build your Adventure"" story game in which you raise your own monsterling from birth to adulthood. It involves quite some good reading and humor. The game gives you lots of choices, like ""save the monsterling - or eat it"", which in progress develop your character and the storyline.Besides the many small story bits, its not overly complex, but its very entertaining.The Achievements are fun to hunt down and you will need to play through the game several times to get them all. Generally the game has plenty of replayability with its varied small stories, so that is not too much of an issue. I played it several times over and still find new ones. A playthrough shouldn't take more than an hour i guess, maybe less.If i had to criticize something, then its probably that its not very long, but i guess that's the way the game was designed, its not meant to be a complex long thing, more something easy to play in between.And i would have loved to be able to design the looks my own monsterling, sadly the game doesn't give that option, i think its random how your monster will look like.Technically the game is solid, no bugs or anything that i would have to mention.Also i totally dig the artstyle, but thats personal preference =)It also has the best emoticons, so thanks for that. ( :hee::ooh::hmm::blech::grr: - they dont work in this Review post )Conclusion: This is a very fun small charming game worth to be played =)			"

												It was fun! ...For the first run or two.Well that was upsetting. Monster Loves You! is a text, choose-your-own-adventure game where you start your life out as a newborn baby monster and you live your life up until your return to the slime vat pool or until you finish the game as an elder who transcended above death to decide what ulitimately happens between the humans and monsters when the inevitable conflict happens.You have 5 personality traits, Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, and Kindness. You gain and use your traits to your advantage in situations that require them. This would be awesome if there was actually more situations that required that. Because more or less everything you do it a sure thing. It's pretty obvious if you're going to lose something or gain something from most interactions. I'll continue that shortly.You use these personality traits to your advantage to gain respect from other elders and monsters so you may be respected enough as an individual to transcend into becoming an elder on the day you are supposed to die. Then once you are an Elder, you must work to either build or sabotage human and monster relations in the coming days before the conflict of humans and monsters. It is this point I believe the story ends with the effort you put into this before the conflict.Everything about this game was really cool except that this game doesn't vary or switch up the story at all. By my second playthrough I already knew pathes and things I needed to say to reap the most (xyz) out of that ""adventure"" So I could get my stats high or close to maxed out as possible while getting tons of respect from the elders. I was hoping that after each death it'd be like a new life with new characters and new adventures. But I kept seeing the same thing over and over again already and it got really tedious and simply not fun. It immediately became apparent that i'd just start grinding to get medals for achievements. I don't care so much about the medals. It's nice to see new endings. But that's not the point of a game like Monster Love You! or at least shouldn't be circled around what the ending is going to be. The meat and soul of the game which is the time spent in each life stage is where you're spending most and pretty much all of your time as opposed to the scripted age-transistion stages. It was like I had a really amazing, fan-friggin-tastic sandwich, and in two playthroughs I felt like I was eating the same sandwich for months. I was so sick of it.Contining on that point is that you get really familiar with each adventure pretty easily, they're very distinct and memorable most of them. And the options listed make it very obvious which choice is going to get you the most points and the good stuff.I was investing in honesty and kindness to achieve renown for honesty and kindness in the game, but I knew the choices in the game so well and understood where I could get off chalk-free in two playthroughs I already knew where I could build ferocity without consequence. I had kindness and cleverness maxed, I had honesty about 86% up there and I had roughly 69% ferocity. I shouldn't be able to get my ferocity stat so high while striving to get honesty and kindness. Cleverness was just so easy to pick up. It made it super-easy to bend the end game to my will because I had such high stats overall I could make the story anything I wanted it to be. Therefore there was really no reason to keep playing the game. Because in two playthroughs I could understand the routes I need to take to get the most (xyz) and how to get the medals and other things.It as a really fun game my first two runs. After that, it just simply wasn't fun. Definitely wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I expected much more out of it after reading such nice reviews.Also continuing, from what i've heard in the game, sounds like the game has only 3 soundtracks in it. And that's just a big no-no. The art directive is okay. They could've worked harder in a lot of areas, but whatever. The humor in this game is great. But it's not funny after you read it the first time.Regardless, Monster Loves You! is a nice and funny and enjoyable game. But after the second playthrough or third, you realize you're just doing the same thing again and it's not fun. I was really hoping that my deaths in the game would have an influence on my next life (which I read this in a review, this was a lie or a fabrication of their beliefs of what's going on in the game) But it doesn't and that's when I realized I was going to just be doing the same thing over and over again.Overall, this game wasn't worth the money I paid for it, I bought it for about 4 dollars and I personally just wouldn't really recommend it at all to be honest. As I said, it's fun and it's nice. But I personally think you should keep that money for something nicer that pops up on the steam store or in a steam sale that you'd rather grab.Anyway, thank you for reading my review. I hope it helped you in your decision to purchase this game or not, have a good day.			"

												""Monster loves you"" is a text based game, an interactive story both for adults who enjoy reading children's books and kids. It's a wonderful storyline with nice music and great humor (btw English here is quite difficult for those who have it as a second language). Monsters are odd and incredibly cute, they will melt your heart and make you smile during the whole game. You can play as one and choose your character, behavior and destiny. Welcome to the cutest monster-world ever! And remember - monster loves you!			"

												Monster Loves You! is a nicely created game with cute monster artwork. You create your own story by making choices in the game. You're born as a monster and the choices you ultimately decide generates what personality and appearance that you will develop as you go along with situations that happen in the game. ♥You can choose to be friendly or ferocious, honest and kind, or clever, you could be a brave monster or afraid of anything that moves! ♥The gameplay can be repetitive, but nice if you enjoy collecting stories or replaying for different outcomes.Overall I thought this was a charming game to play to relax and has a lot of amusing text to read as you create your own outcomes and story. ♥If you like cartoons and decision making platform games that are not too complicated and you enjoy creating your own story outcomes, you will love Monster Loves You! and Monster Loves You! will Love You! too. :]  ♥			"

												'Monster Loves You!' falls into a very unique category;  It's essentially a 'Choose Your Own Adventure' game--an interactive book.It is entirely meditative:  you direct the flow of your monster through various events and stages of life and enjoy the colourful illustrations and caricatures.  The prompts and narratives have a sense of humour all their own and it makes for a delightful read.  My only complaint might be that there are so few pieces of music in the game and they feel droning after a few plays.On the whole, though, it does well with a morning cup of coffee and a friend in chat.  Go on, give it a try.  At the very least, it's a refreshing new take on what games can be.			"

												Monster Loves You! is a unique text-based game where you take control of a monster in the forest of Waelmist. The actions you take will affect your monster in many ways (Cleverness, Ferocity, Kindness, Bravery, Respect, etc.). After your adulthood, you can either choose to dissolve in the ""Spawning Vat"" and allow your greatest trait to carry on in the next generation of monster or ascend to the status of Elder monster. When you play as an Elder, you get to decide the fate of humans and monsters by taking more actions (talking with your fellow monsters or traveling to the human city), which I enjoyed. There are 14 endings to discover so you'll be playing this for hours.8/10			"

Each achievement here are the different endings possible in the game. The story is easy to follow and guess since the choices and stat system are simple, at best.

												Monster Loves You! is a text-based choose your own adventure game. You guide your monster through stages of its life, your actions determining your monster's attributes, such as ferocity, cleverness, and bravery.While each stage of life has multiple short adventures to take your monster on, they rarely influence each other, beyond some of them becoming easier depending on which 'stats' you've leveled up beforehand. It isn't until the latter of the game, which you may or may not reach due to your decisions in game, where you begin having an influence on anything beyond your monster village and the woods around it.Monster society is darkly humour- black comedy abounds. You meet many different fairytale creatures and have an opportunity to try and befriend or viciously murder and eat all of them. The soundtrack and visuals are bright and cartoonish, and fit perfectly.Each play-through will take you about twenty to thirty minutes, depending on how fast of a reader you are, and getting most of the endings is pretty intuitive. It's a good game to pass the time.			"

												Monster Loves You! is short and solid.It's a choose-your-own-adventure style game with a very high density of choices to be made crammed into a small package. The result is that everything you do feels important, and with too much to do in a single play-thru the replayability factor is somewhat high. However, the game isn't long and multiple play-thrus--once you understand the format--can be accomplished in rapid succession and the game peters out.Still, it has lovely graphics and makes for a few really fun rounds in a notably unique monster world and culture. While not being expansive it is highly detailed and definitely worth a look if you enjoy the pick-your-consequences genre.			"

												The whole game is a big dialog tree. You're presented with a situation and you choose one of the 2 or 3 responses to the situation until you evertually reach one of the 12 endings.Unfortunately, there's very little random variation between games and choices early in the game affect your stats but not the scenarios you encounter later. After two playthroughs, you'll have encountered most of the scenarios even if you make very different choices on your next playthrough... so there's little incentive to try for the other 11 endings after you've seen your first.The hour or so of content here makes it hard to justify the purchase price.Subscribe to my curator page hereView my other reviews here "

												It's a really nice litte game to pass your time and do things, you can't do on a normal day (like eating everything that doesn't run fast enough...) As for me, I'm having a hard time to be the bad guy... So the farious endings became a bit limited. Usally I start out fine, being angry, beating other monsterlings... but then... I end up helping the others *sigh* but it's still a lot of fun! I'm planing to play it with a friend, who can stop me from beeing nice. The grafic ist cute and colourfull, it runs very smooth, even on my old machine and in windowed mode. It really makes me smile to meet the well known personas from the fairytales... although eating little red riding hood ist like killing the last bit of childhood. But she was tasty!Long story short: buy it, play it, have fun! If you aren't a bitter, angry, progress-orientated, goal-reaching-by-any-means-person, there is a high chance you will like this game. Who wouldn't be a Monster??			"

												5.5/10+ Pretty enjoyable if you've never played a text-only Choose Your Own Adventure game before. My one previous attempt, The Forest of Doom, felt much more tedious and ended prematurealy.+ Eventful for such a short game. From birth to elderhood (and more) in 1 hour.+ Music and sound effects (though minimal) are very fitting+ No rolling dice - Very misleading screenshots in the store page. 99% of the game is choosing between textual options. Only 2 of the 10 screenshots are representative of this.- Not my kind of game. Not the game's fault, just not my thing.I only played enough to get one ending, but I believe it's sufficient to grasp the concept of how Choose Your Own Adventure game work. I probably won't try to get the other endings in the foreseeable future. My backlog is full of games that are much more appealing to me, and I don't care about achievements etc. Bottom line is that I wouldn't pay full price for this game, but I think it's worth getting in a bundle, if only to get a chance to familiarize yourself with this type of games (if you're not already familiar with it).

Cartoony feel that is not common with this text adventure style game, though a welcome addition to the genre. Lots of different paths and endings available to tour.CONS: Virtually no challenge. Graphics feel a bit over-used and stock. Writing is a little childish at times.WORTH: There are surprisingly many ways to mold the ending, so finding them all is a pretty fun timesink. Still probably not worth $10.OVERALL:This game is cute, I enjoyed playing through it. I'm sure if this team took on more adult themes in their next text-based adventure project, it would go wonderfully.

												I have played this game once and I ended up being a kind monster. It's fun that you can affect what kind of monster you want to be. Your story starts as a little innocent monster and your actions will affect to your personality while your growing up.There's 14 different types/endings that you can achieve, you just need to think carefully what to say or do in every situation.So if you like choice based game which affects to the sory line this game is for you. The game is about 1h long (one play through).Style is cute and also the soundtrack is very nice.Maybe the only one minus in the game is that there's so much text to read and you can't really interact with anything and it might get boring in a while. Otherwise I really enjoyed playing it.Soon I'm going to play it again, let's see what kind of monster I'm going to turn out then!(Cried when my mosnter died at the end T.T).8/10			"

												Monster Loves You is an adorable little experience where you play as a growing monster, making decisions and developing your personality. If you buy into the Story vs. Game debate it definantly lands more on the interactive story end. The choices you make give you points in certain attributes that are then tested at a handful of landmarks. While not necessarily a very flashy or unique game, I found myself repeatedly going back to discover new endings and storylets. Overall, if you aren't a fan of games like The Walking Dead or No One Has To Die you probably won't find too much enjoyment here, but if you're looking for whimsically cute interactive story, I'd definantly give this one a shot.

												This game is a bit different. Its a ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" kind of game were you play a monster that is growing up and evolving. Your choices effect what stats and such you gain, and they effect your dialogs and actions. It has an surprisingly large amount of dialog and details and I was overall impressed by the quality of the game.There are 14 achievements in the game were each is awarded for one of the 14 outcomes of the game. This sadly makes the early parts of the games very repetitive since you need to do them 14 times at a minimum but probably many times more unless you do everything right every single time. Most outcomes are easy to achieve, and only one of them is really tricky but can be gotten with some patience and experimentation.Time to 100%: 6 hours			"

												Hey, did you like the part of Mass Effect where you choose responses to get Universe Savior or Bad Space Cop points? Because that's what this game feels like to me. Except there's five kinds of stats and a mid level boss dependent entirely on dice rolls. It is based around living the life of a monster from birth to death, but it doesn't go far enough with it. Because of that, all the conversation forks are based around me asking myself 'Do I want more Furious Fred or Smarty Sammy points?'. It's kinda fun to experience once, maybe twice if you choose to sacrifice your monster at the midpoint of the game, and after that it's just about rote achievement hunting.			"

												What an adorable little  game! Monster Loves You is a  ""Build Your Adventure""  casual game.  I had fun trying to unlock the different endings and to grow my little monsterling to an Elder who may lead Monsters to peace or war with Humans (Or having him become a neurosurgeon). Or, to have my monster sacrifice himself to help create future monsters with his best attributes. The artwork is  colorful, lovely, and charming, reminding me of picture books that I read at a young age. The music is quirky and fits with the game quite well. Gameplay wise, it can be a bit tedious to unlock every ending, however, it's a great game to pick up casually. In addition, this would be a great game to play with your family, adults and children alike.			"

												There is something special about Monster Loves You!Simple, but deceptively replayable. It's a choose-your-own-adventure type of game, starting you as a monsterling that was just born. With multiple stats (initially at zero), your actions will lead to the community respecting you (or not) and increasing statistical values about your personality (bravery, cleverness, etc.).This is simple but, again, rather adictive. After 6 hours and about 8 (?) playthroughs I'm still getting newer and newer stories as I go along, which adds the replay value of the game (besides the fact that it possesses 14(!!) ending, to my knowledge).Graphically it's just multiple backgrounds with no real animations (unless you click your monster avatar, which will make him jump and say weird ♥♥♥♥ xD), so to review graphics, I'd really review one thing:UI (INTERFACE)Nothing short of great. Buttons are clear, with something indicating what the story behind each clickable button may consist of. A scared monster face may lead to a story about investigating a human house, for example. Nothing more to say, really, informative, simple and slick, the UI excells in this adventure game unlike for of its genre.AUDIOWith no voice acting, that leads the music which is kind of a few tracks that repeat themselves. They are pretty good and chilling, suiting the happy and cute atmosphere the game transmits.STORYBarely got anything to say about it:You start -> You're born.Game ends -> You shifted the course of the world, creating an endless war between monsters and humans, or united them into one civilization filled with compassion and honor between eachother. OR you simply died, recognized for the trait you leveled up the most (braveness for example).This allows for alot of replayability considering you like the style and the atmosphere of the game. Since it's pretty much YOUR story, relatability to the main character resides in you and only you. It's well done and the cuteness of your activities, monster reactions, UI design and drawing  give the game a MASSIVE boom of charm and interest to the player. This is precisely where you'll find the best part of the game. The juxtaposition of the charming style and the story make the game worth, in my opinion a purchase at any price equal or below its base one (9,99€).The emoticons are expensive as ♥♥♥♥, tho. Anyway, I digress. Game's fully worth it for it's uniqueness among the genre. A solid 8/10 for me!P.S: Kinda weird steam updated it's review system and forgot the much asked ""meh button"", the score system introduction and all that...The game is amazing and has nothing to do with said ""Meh"" button, but still... this review system still feels rather barebones and Valve sure has the potential to make this a great environment for a complex but useful review system (since any idiot can hop on Metacritic for example and bash a game they don't like, like Call of Duty (and that does happens to CoD, we all know it!)).Anyway, just my 2 cents...

												This is a very cute text style game where your choices determine what sort of monster you'll grow into and what influence you'll have on your peers. I like the writing and the story; with cute and comedic dialogue as well as interesting options. It has definite replay value and a pleasant atmosphere. The adventures you take will not remain the same every time. Each time you leave the spawning vat will likely be a new experience. If you have kids I think it would be something enjoyable to play with them because it's a lot like an interactive story and seems very innocent.			"

												I got this game as a gift from a friend first off.About this game:A text game basicaly where you are a mosnter born and then get thrown into different situations. Problem is, this particular game is buggy. For example, the ending just freezes up the the game. As much as i want to upvote this...in good conscious i cannot due to it being buggy. If you still want to try it, it is somewhat fun if it was not for the bugs. I suggest if you want to try it, wait for a sale to buy it.Also, there is a repition issue. The game store page states the game changes storyline every time you play, but it really does not. It just rehases it over and over again in different situations...sure it is fun for like 2 rounds of it, but it gets old very fast. It might be enjoyable to a very young child though..			"

												tl;dr: I had fun but it's nowhere near worth the price.Nice art, fun story... not much game. You click through a series of events making minor decisions and then get an ending based on how smart, respected, strong, etc. you were. No problem, typical visual novel stuff, and a much more interesting premise than dating high schoolers. The problem is it took all of 75 minutes for me to play through TWICE, during which I saw several repeat events despite trying to pick a completely opposite style. I can't imagine a third playthrough.For $1 this would get a hearty thumbs up. Anyone who pays $10 will be sorely disappointed. Some short games can justify a high price because they're that unique or amazing. This is not one of them.			"

												I purchased this game as a result of a discount coupon from crafting badges. My initial thoughts for this game were boring, repetative, and tedious; however the more I got into the game the more I began to appreciate it for what it was, an education tool to promote reading. Yes, reading. This game is suited to teach children the idea of ""action and consiquence."" with a fun twist.I would highly recommend this game to parents who would want to improve the literacy skills of their kids.TLDR: The game is geared for a young audience to improve the proficiency of their reading; but can be enjoyed by anyone who seeks a light-hearted adventure.Score:(5/5) for an Educational Game(3/5) for an Indie Casual Game(2/5) for Achievement Hunters			"

												Bought on a whim during a sale, this is a lovely, charming casual game that I recommend, perhaps not at full price but definitely on sale.It is quick to play from start to end, with less than an hour for a completion from monsterling to elder, however due to the nature of the game it has a lot of replay value. The format is all choices based on presented situations, which the result will increase or decrease various stats. I found it easy and intuitive to guide the play towards the monster I wanted to be without too much thought.This isn't a title to sink your teeth into, but for short sessions in a beautifully created world, it is perfect.

												""Monster Loves You!"" is literally a Choose Your Own Adventure text game, with some general background drawings. It's not the same as an exploration game where you punch in keywords or try to work your way around somewhere.The time it takes to complete the actual game is 30 to 40 minutes, depending on how fast you're picking options and reading. Technically, you can fly through it in approximately 15 minutes or less if you know what events and choices you want. Each achievement for the game is completing it with a new ending, and when you replay, the events don't change unless you trigger something specific at the first endgame point.If you care about getting the achievements, you can reuse saves as some guides explain. It really is not that worthwhile to replay it 14 full times because more than half of those times you'll be choosing the exact same actions.I thought the game looked a bit interesting in drawing style, hence why I got it. But it turns out that there really aren't that many different graphical screens. And most of the time, they're just shadowed out because of the text boxes, sitting on top of the screen for you to read and decide upon.Your monster has a set of stats that you can increase as you choose certain events, and the game's ending is determined essentially by those stats, as well as a few other endgame choices. No event until the ""final"" age event actually triggers the ending. Thus, the game fits an exact carbon-copy mold of the same general things happening over and over, which also adds to your boredom and the game's lack of fun replayability.Going through the adventure of the game was just really disappointing, as not many of the events are that exciting. The developer's claim of the 900+ choices is quite an exaggeration, since most events don't differ by much at all with their choices. And the fact that it's an extremely short story means that it doesn't require any investment or make you even care about what is happening.			"

												It's a cute game. I would play this with a child. We would learn a lot in how to get along with others and for that I have a positive view of Monster Loves You! For a parent, this is probably a good game to play with their children.But it is far too short to justify a $10 pricetag. There is simply not enough content to justify it. Another thing worth considering is that your actions, generally, provide few negative consequences. You would have to actively seek out the worst possible answer to even reach the worst endings within this game. There is simply no challenge, though in retrospect, that may have been the point. However, given the lack of content, this only serves to hurt the game instead of actually reinforcing the gaming experience, gaming being used very liberally in this situation.I really do like this game. I appreciated the variety in the scenarios and the writing was very cute. However, there is simply not enough to do in this game and the things to do don't provide any measure of challenge. I found myself with most of stats being maxed out without any active consideration towards any stat but one. It was honestly harder for me to not get both Human and Monster relationships up to 100%. It just seemed like this was too easy and even though I'm not expecting something difficult on the level of some other Steam games, it just felt like this game was handing everything to me. So, sure, buy this game and play it with your kids. But, honestly, there could have been so much more and for that, I cannot recommend buying this.			"

 Overview Monster Loves You! is a casual indie game where you play the role of a young monsterling, with simple choices that soon will dictate your future as you change into a monster. You live your life, ascending to elderhood and beyond, making a difference into the world of humans and monsters. The Pros  Adventure  - The fact that the endings are so different and unique with each choice you make and each gamethrough - makes the process of playing fun.  Soundtrack  - The music is smoothing and relaxing, the ambient changes as to the situation you are in and the different stages of your monster.  The achivements  - It has very easy to obtain achivements. All the 14 achivements are game related and are based on the way you make your choices, the tricky part is that you have to play the game again for 14 times in order to get all the achivements - dictating the end of you life as a monster. Don't worry - completing the game with all the achivements takes around 5 - 6 hours.  The price  - The game is always found in either different budles or at 50% off. The low prices you might find at sales or coupons justify the buy.  Phone  - You can play this game on your telephone, be it Android or IPhone.You can enjoy all the stages of the evolving your monster at the comfort of your bed, on your phone. The BONUS  - You can become a Neurosurgeon, also one of the achivements, with just some simple choices and without needing any medical preparations! The Cons   Trading Cards  - I loved this game and I wanted to craft the badge but the spicy price the trading cards have made me think twice. Though the perks of having a badge in this amazing indie game made the damage minimal. Though, if you want to sell the trading cards you can get in on a big advantage and I recommend you do this.  Repetitive Gaming  - Even though I liked to play it for 14 times, it got boring. The scenes dont change, the characters dont change, the challenges dont change, the musin doesn't change. The only difference is the 5 minutes at the end where all the magic happens.  The personality  - As you make different choices you upgrade your Kindness, Bravery, Ferocity, etc. The fact that you don't know  which  one of them you upgrade can also lead to removing points from others(such as +1 Ferocity, -2 Kindness). Conclusion Did I like this game? A lot!Do I recommend this game? Yes.It has so many posibilities and over 900 choices to make - Devour a little girl, help a wounded deer, eat three little pigs, ASCEND TO BECOME AND ELDER AND LEAD THE MONSTER TO ANIHILATE THE HUMANS, and so on.This game is worth purchasing.

												A really quick game to play but as it has multiple outcomes it will be a game I keep returning to, it requires very little concentration so it's a nice, easy game to chill out with. The visuals of the game are cute, good colours and a clean, simple design. It reminds me of ""Long Live The Queen"" in a way because the choices you make affect the outcome and give you trait points (kindness, bravery and ferocity for example) which will then further affect decisions you can make.

It will require multiple playthroughs if you want to get all the achievements, which may become tedious if you do not have the patience to go through the same game multiple times. There are many choices which you can make within the game, which all eventually affects the type of ending you will get. If you enjoyed reading Choose Your Own Adventure books in your childhood, then you will certainly enjoy this game. If you didn't enjoy those books or you don't even know what I'm talking about, still buy this game because I guarantee you will enjoy it! 10/10			"

												Monster Loves You! is a casual, text based, Create-Your-Own adventure game.You are a monster, living in a monster town. You begin as a tiny monsterling, and grow as the game progresses. Through childhood, into adulthood, and possibly even as a monster elder, you must make choices. Each choice alters your monster in some way, and lead up to several different endings based on how you choose to play. The writing is humorous at times, with you having to decide between truth or lies, fight or flight, and occasionally whether to help someone out...or just eat them and be done with it. The art style is something out of a toddler's story book, which fits surprisingly well with the game's design; and the story itself isn't very long, which makes it a great time filler.The game is simple, easy to pick up, and family friendly. However if you don't enjoy point and click games, or the Create-Your-Own adventure style, then this probably isn't the game for you.			"

												So, I found this game today on the store because I received a coupon for it. With 75% off, I figured why not? I didn't pay much attention to the reviews and just gave it a go.What you have here is a cute and charming choose your own adventure game, with pretty backgrounds and nice ambient music. However the entire gameplay consists of essentially multiple choice answers to various situations. You go through each stage of a monster's life, from being born, an adolesencent, an adult, and then you either dissolve and die or become an elder. When you're an elder you decide the fate of the monsters versus humans. Depending on your choices you gain points in personality traits, which you need for other decisions later in the game. Based on your personality and your choices you can get one of 14 endings. An average play should take about 40 minutes, as it did with me. It's a very charming little title, and if you know what you're getting, go ahead and buy it. But if you're looking for something beyond ""click click click"" for forty minutes, your attention is best placed elsewhere.			"

It has many different endings that boil down to what you want your legacy in this world to be.

												This game certainly wasn't what I was expecting it to be. I was under the impression that making decisions to develop how your monster grows meant exactly that. I was expecting more than an interactive story.If anyone saw my library, they would see that I have no problem playing story-based games. I love story-based games. However, the story-based games I purchase allow me to watch the story unravel as I play them. This story-based game is little more than a ""choose your own path"" book with a few pictures. If I wanted a ""choose your own path"" story with a few pictures, I'd purchase a book. It'd be cheaper and I could take it back to the bookstore for credit when I was finished.On the other hand, however, the story was different and the perspective was fascinating. If you don't mind a game that's almost entirely text-based, by all means, purchase it. If you are expecting to actually see your monster develop and grow, you will be horribly disappointed. Its only saving grace for me was that I purchased it on sale and I lost very little in doing so.I do not recommend this game unless you A) know what you are getting yourself into and B) don't mind paying the price for it.

												The most recent choose-your-own-adventure, (primarily) text-based game I have played is Dark Scavenger. I was interested in this game after discussing it with my brother, who had seen a playthrough by YouTube personalities Game Grumps. A few days later, this game was the Steam Daily Deal.If you like super casual gameplay, choose-your-own-adventures, and text-based games, then you will enjoy Monsters Loves You!The game is extremely short - I completed one playthrough in less than 45 minutes. Keep in mind, however, that I read A LOT and can read considerably quickly. The aesthetics (like most other elements of this game) are fairly casual with a small pool of recycled pictures and text. The detail in the scenery is good, and your monster's appearance varies greatly and seems to be determined by the initial options you select. The music is suprisingly good, and the ending background music in particular adds a majestic, urgent feel to the gameplay. The controls just involve you to click, and the learning curve is minimal. There is no apprent tutorial, however, many of the options have a ""help"" button that you can click, allowing things to be explained without progressing the story - in dialogue options, this is usually presented as the top/first option (clicking it will provide you with additional situational information without continuing the story).I have to stress that gameplay is extremely casual, and since this is a text-based game, you will have to really rely on your imagination to fill in the details. Readers interested in the theme will probably like this game, however, if you do not read regularly (especially for recreational purposes) you may find this game to be very boring. Almost every decision you make in the game will result in you obtaining (or even losing) different stat points like bravery, respect, ferocity, honesty, etc. For example, fighting a bear and winning may give you points in bravery, ferocity, and respect. Besides respect, every monster stat is represented on the bottom of the screen in the form of different icons, and you can click each one to give you additional information. You can level all stats to a maximum of 100.The stats are important for the end-game, where many of your actions are dependent on your stat scores (ex: to successfully fught off an opponent you need a high bravery/ferocity rating). Furthermore, respect is extremely important for getting other monsters on your side, especially in political situations. While the ""politics"" element really interested me, remember that this is an extremely casual game, and the politicial intrigue is reflectively minimal. Most of the politics involves your interactions with both the human and monster communities, and the end-game (if you get that far) will add two new gauges - the ""how humans view monsters"" and ""how monster view humans"" meters (maximum value of 100). Respect is critical for the end-game, where your decisions will determine which particular ending you receive.Each ""phase"" of the monster's life cycle is broken up, and you have a fixed amount of turns before you advance to the next stage of life. The last stage requires you to have a high respect rating and/or high character stats. During each ""phase,"" you can go adventuring. I really liked this part, because you only have enough ""turns"" (represented by days) in each ""phase"" to go on adventures. When selecting an adventure, you must click on different icons to activate a mission - you are not given any information besides the pictures on each adventure icon. I loved this mechanic because it made things less predictable and also more exciting. I am not sure if the available adventures are randomized for each playthrough, but I have noticed that they can be different each time (it may depend on the initial options you pick right when you start playing).For achievement hunters, you will have to do A LOT of playthroughs, since you need to unlock every possible ending. After doing enough playthroughs, you should be able to progress through the game fairly quickly, especially once each adventure icon becomes more and more familiar to you. That being said, it is very, very easy for you to become bored of this game if you try to get all the achievements in one (or few) sittings, since all of the decision tree consequences will be known to you. Instead, I strongly suggest you only do one playthrough per sitting, and try to spread the playtime for this game around to keep things fresh. Remember, there is A LOT of text in this game, so avoid it if you do not like reading.For choose-your-own-adventure buffs and text-based game lovers, this casual game will fit very well in your libraries. For anyone not interested in those things, you might want to avoid playing this.Recommend!Cheers,DJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews "

												I've only played once through. 1.7 hours but to tell you the truth, I took a break here and there to do other things. That shows how quickly this game can pass. Having said that, it's fairly cute and would be amusing to play along with children. As a family-friendly game, it certainly works. It's an easy way to pass a little time; it isn't exactly difficult to get the kind of ending you'd prefer. Even while I was split between about 3 of the 5 statistics, it all worked out exactly as I planned. This is not a game for anybody looking for a challenge or a long story path. I thought that I wouldn't be interested playing it a second time but actually, I'd like to see how the game handles the more ferocious choices. I would have liked a little more to the ""and everybody was happy"" ending. I wanted a monster family (or even a cross monster-human one). It also would have been good to feel like I actually knew the other monsters being mentioned. That will likely come after a few replays. Not particularly wowed by how the game looks. As I said, it's a cute game, however I think it feels a bit bland at times. I had hoped eventually there would be more to click on, even if it was simply to show a picture or make a noise. It would be good to see additional features.I don't feel like I need to play through more before reviewing. My main reason for posting this is to say that while the game is worth a go, I would personally advise waiting for at least a 30% discount. Honestly, I don't know much about game development so I can't say if the price tag is fair for the work put it. But since this is Steam and you'll likely have a chance to get it for cheaper, I'd say have a bit of patience unless you don't mind overly one way or another.			"

												Monster Loves You! is a cute choose your own adventure game. You are a newborn monster and you have to develop a few skills that may help you later in the game. You can do that by choosing an adventure, and make the choices that you would like to do.You grow older, and there are many more adventures to follow. Will the other monsters respect you? And how do humans view monsters and visa versa? You can decide that with your own behaviour in the stories. The game is not very long, I think you can complete one story in 45 minutes. Luckily, the game has a high replayability due to the multiple endings. The stories where you can choose from are amusing to read. The artstyle looks cartoony and I think it looks very cute as well. The slow paced music fits the game perfectly, because it is a cute but relaxing tune.I would recommend to buy this game in a sale. It is a good game if you want to take a break from all the fastpaced games. My rating for this game: 7/10			"

												I loved, loved, loved this game.  It took me about an hour to beat, but the humor and story were perfect (I was genuinely laughing at certain points) and I really cared about the little monster I created.  Although the game encourages you to replay to get all of the rest of the endings, I had little desire to revisit the same scenarios over and over again.  So if you're anything like me, you're really looking at about two hours of gameplay tops.  If you do decide to go completionist, I imagine you'll quickly get bored at the redundancy and the early charming humor of the game may end up actually becoming an annoying slog to get through.  Just a possible word of warning.I'm recommending this game enthusiastically (again, I had a great time), but believe it's priced a bit too high for what you actually get (I think it should be a $4.00 game tops).  Definitely pick it up when it's on sale or included as part of a bundle.I've deliberately not mentioned many details of the game because I feel like the experience is best going in as blind as possible.  Even if you do spend full price for this game, I doubt you'll regret it.			"

Some of the stats include: cleverness, ferocity, bravery, etc. Although game play may be limited to about less than a dozen hours, the amount of time spent to be reached the multiple endings is a reward enough.

												It's humour; pure humour. If you don't enjoy games that are about making choices and seeing how those choices affect your character's development, as well as the world around you, then this game isn't for you. If you do, however, then this game will make you laugh.After all, how often do you run into a game where you grow out of a vat like a amoeba, turn into something nature could only invent when it's drunk on whisky, and get Kindness-points when you feed your colleague an entire ant colony?This games takes the old concept of allowing the reader (player) allowing to influence a story's outcome through interaction, and makes a computer-game out of it. Will you turn Kind, and work to increase understanding between monsters and humans? Or will you become Ferocious, and wage war until all the humans are dead?...while discussing the philosophy of rocks, and feeding your fellow monsters entire ant colonies.			"

												Monster Loves You! is a super cute visual novel where you grow up as a monster. You make choices as a monsterling to determine the basis of your personality, then make choices as an adult to gain the respect of your fellow monsters. If you survive to become an elder, your choices can affect the relationship between humans and monsters to bring about peace or conflict. There are several different endings, so there's a  lot of replayability. There are a variety of adventures, though some do repeat in each playthrough. Overall, I enjoyed and recommend it.

												I really wanted to down vote this game as it appears to be a blatant mobile app port, but after playing through three times I can’t. The game is strangely addictive and I find myself wanting to see all the endings. The UI looks and feels like a mobile app. It consists of large, easy to press, buttons on a simple background. The buttons come in two different types, pictures which are somehow related to an action, and dialogue for different choices and tests. The game play is simple, you click a button, read some text, and see how your choices modify your stats. You go through several development phases, starting as a baby slime and moving up through full fledged elder monster. If you make it to the end, you can decide the fate of monsters and humans.The choices and options can get repetitive over multiple playthroughs. This is particularly frustrating since auto-saving means you you need to start from the beginning each time you attempt to get a new ending. As there are 14 different endings, I really wish there was some sort of save or rewind functionality so that you could skip the earlier phases. As long as you don’t mind eating children or kittens it's a good game to kill some time.  "

												What a game! So simple and yet so great.  Take all the glamor and game play away from the walking dead, and you're left with decisions, consequence and a long term outcome.  Throw a little child like humor in, along with some classic movie quotes, and you have a game that will leave you smiling time and time again.  It doesn't take long to finish, but you should get many play throughs out of it.  If you really like this kind of game, its worth 10, otherwise you can get it on sale for 5 soon enough.			"

												Monster Loves you is a choose your own adventure style story.The main backbone of the story follows your life, as a monster, from the moment you are born in the ""spawning vat"".  As you progress through the story, at certain points in your life you are given adventures to go on. The choices you make in these adventures determine the course of your life, and the overall outcome of the story. There are a wide array of adventures available at each section.You might think that this is simply a game for kids, but while kids will enjoy this, it does have some aspects where an adult might understand the more mature themes. It is worth noting however, that the overall playtime for the game is quite low, but trying to get the possible endings & exploring all of the available adventures will bump that time up somewhat.The graphics in this game are very nice. Although they are not the most important part. That falls to the text. The story is written in a very nice way, that makes it easy to enage in.The game is controlled via a mouse although if you can stream to or play the game on a tablet, it will work much better.The music in this game is very nice. It's not too obtrusive and compliments the storylike nature of the game.Something I do feel that this game would really benefit from is if there were some way of making user-generated adventures. After several play throughs, you will come accross all of the adventures and end up repeating yourself.All in all, ths is a very nice choose your own adventure game which is definitely worth buying. Although, If you don't like reading, then don't buy the game. "

												Monster Loves You! Does what it does well, but it doesn’t do a whole lot. It is a charming, simple and cute game that won’t cost you a lot but also won’t last very long. If you’re looking for a decent visual novel, this is certainly an interesting one to try out, if just for the concept of playing as a little monster. The art style itself is great albeit lacking in animations, the dialogue is quite amusing at times and there are quite a few choices to make that lead to different endings. If that is what you’re looking for, then this is worth a shot. If you are looking for something with more sustenance or context, or simply more gametime, then this will definitely not do.

												Monster Loves You! is a graphical text adventure where you raise a little monster. You can 'level up' your monster in several categories by going on 'adventures' (little stories, in terms of gameplay). As you get older you start thinking about your relationship with humans. Are they evil or good ? It's up to you to decide how you want to play. The developers found a nice, clever way to tell a story where you decide the outcome. There are multiple endings (14 if the achievements aren't lying) so there's more than enough replay value here. One playthrough should take you about an hour.A cute little game ![Rating: 72/100]			"

												MLY isn't so much a game as it's an interactive story, like a Choose Your Own Adventure book. That doesn't mean it's bad, but if you're looking for frenetic gameplay, you won't find it here. Instead, everything in this game hinges on your decisions and how you live your life as a monster.If I had to compare MLY to a video game, the closest thing would be a very, very old game called Alter Ego (from 1986, not the 2010 game of the same name). The similarities are striking, with the exception that in MLY you play a monster in a fictional world whereas in AE you were a male or female human in the real world. Although MLY's interface is better than AE's, it lacks the same depth. In AE, you didn't just make decisions and get older, but you could get an education, hold down a job, get married, get pregnant (if you were female), die prematurely, and so on.I wish MLY had included something like those options as it would've increased the replay value a lot.  That said, it's still an entertaining and unusual experienceand, so if you get it on sale (which I did) then you'll get your money's worth.			"

												A visual-novel-orientated, adventure game experience, whereby the actions and lifestyle of your monster are the result of the decisions you make for them.- Think of it as...a bag coloured stones, and each stone gives you a different situation depending on which colour you pick. That's very similar to how you progress through your story, to result in many different endings.Re-playability  -  great, definitely possible without getting bored.- I completely adore the soundtracks in Monster Loves You. Definitely in my short-list of favourites.- Goofy yet comically loveable art. Definitely worth a play if you enjoy visual-novels and have no problems with a high amount of reading.			"

												A great little game. I enjoyed two full playthroughs, one I made with Reputation at mere 35% or so, the other at over 50%. There was a difference in the main story.Good thing is, there are so many side stories to choose from, that my playthroughs were quite different, even if I ended up as a Kind and Clever monster in both cases, but that was just because of my choices.I guess I couldn't make myself to become a proper Ferocious monster even if my life depended on it. :-)Kudos to the makers of this game.

												Monster Loves You was a game I played because it looked interesting and odd. I was looking for some new ideas for games and was surprised to discover that it's a choose-your-own-adventure story. Not a lot of new elements were present as far as the game itself, yet I loved it. (The game itself was a lot like the old books which used character sheets)  I have no idea why it was so darn charming, but I played through to get the various endings and trying different approaches.The writing, graphics, and music all mix well. While the gameplay itself is a pretty good interface to a very basic game, the story is unusual enough to be fun. It's an interesting take on what it means to be an alien creature. It's also a study in how simple games can be quite fun.(I've played the game more on mobile than PC, since the mobile version was less buggy.)			"

												Monster Loves You! is a choose-your-own-adventure-esque RPG from Radial Games and Dejobaan Games LLC. Let’s get rocking.The GoodIt’s hard to classify what genre this game should fall into (gameplay wise) as it is very similar to a visual novel, but it does have aspects of an RPG. Whatever it is, it does a good job of being what it is. MLY! has a lot of possible endings and a lot of ways to get to those endings. Naturally, this provides a lot of replay value, which is always a good thing.The artwork in the game is consistently charming. It is kid friendly (some of the content may be a bit darker for younger audiences. just so you know) and vibrantly colored.The game as a whole, I think, is very creative. You, as the player, experience the entire lifespan of a monster from spawning to death. What events fill the time in between those two are entirely up to you. Every choice you make in the game not only counts, but very significantly impacts your late and end game.The BadGo ahead and scroll on past this one.The MehIf you’re not really a fan of reading, this may not be the game for you.If you’re looking for a gory, violent game about being a monster, this may not be the game for you.Verdict: YeaAll in all, Monster Loves You! is a fun, lighthearted game that, I think, anyone can enjoy playing. If you’re looking for something to do around Halloween time and you’ve got some extra cash, take a look at this game. If you have kids and you’re looking for a game for them to play around Halloween, this could just be your game.			"

												A great little game. I enjoyed two full playthroughs, one I made with Reputation at mere 35% or so, the other at over 50%. There was a difference in the main story.Good thing is, there are so many side stories to choose from, that my playthroughs were quite different, even if I ended up as a Kind and Clever monster in both cases, but that was just because of my choices.I guess I couldn't make myself to become a proper Ferocious monster even if my life depended on it. :-)Kudos to the makers of this game. Thank you for something so different than the mainstream. I would wholeheartedly recommend the game to everyone.			"

												Monster Loves You was a game I played because it looked interesting and odd. I was looking for some new ideas for games and was surprised to discover that it's a choose-your-own-adventure story. Not a lot of new elements were present as far as the game itself, yet I loved it. (The game itself was a lot like the old books which used character sheets)  I have no idea why it was so darn charming, but I played through to get the various endings and trying different approaches.The writing, graphics, and music all mix well. While the gameplay itself is a pretty good interface to a very basic game, the story is unusual enough to be fun. It's an interesting take on what it means to be an alien creature. It's also a study in how simple games can be quite fun.(I've played the game more on mobile than PC, since the mobile version was less buggy.)			"

												A cute and enjoyable Choose-Your-On-Advneture style game with stats.In the different stages of you life as a monster, you are presented with short missions/stories where you choice of action will determine which stat, if any, gets a boost. Later in ""life"", the stat will determine if you will continue to live or die, how well Elders are listening to your advice and what the outcome of the inevitable meeting between Humans and Monsters is going to be (also if you get a career as a disguised neuro surgeon among the humans or not!)Each lifecycle takes between 20-40 minutes to complete. Later ones take a bit longer if you are going for specific outcomes, as you suddenly need to plan ahead.After playing a lifecycle 3 times, I started noticing a lot of repeated missions/stories, and while the writing is pretty good and quite funny, the repeats are my only real gripe about this game, as it turns an otherwise very nice casual title into a grind for the achievements.

												Monster Loves You! is a charming text based, choose your own adventure game. You live the life of a monster, from conception to old age (if you make it that far!).  The game has 14 possible endings, all with their own achievements. Each stage of life offers you different, randomized scenarios. These plot points can add or subtract points to your personality traits and overall village respect rating. Two hours in, and five monster lives lived, I find myself impressed with the number of scenarios that exist in the game. I keep coming upon ones I haven't seen before in all of the different stages of life. I feel as if I'm truly a different monster each time, which leads me to be pleasantly surprised by the replay value. $10 may be a little much for a game that requires nothing more than some clicking, but I would encourage anyone to pick it up during a sale. What kind of monster will you be? Will you dissolve into a vat of slime? Or will you lead a revolution? Either way, you'll have a fun time doing it.			"

												Monster Loves You is a pretty cute ""choose-your-own-adventure""-esque game, where you control your monster through a variety of encounters from birth until either death or the resolution of the struggles between Monsterkind and Humankind. Your decisions affect your stats, much like a simple RPG, and ultimately play a role in how each playthrough ends. There's not a lot here gameplay wise, as you might expect, but MLY is fairly well written, providing both some genuinely touching moments and some good laughs, and the art style, while somewhat limited, is pretty adorable. While it is unquestionably aimed towards children, it can appeal to everyone so long as they're willing to look past the cutesy demeanor.At $10 USD, it's a bit overpriced; even with 14 different endings providing a fair bit of replay value, you'll still likely be able to see all there is to see in 4-6 hours at most. However, this game is worth a look whenever its on sale, or if the price ends up dropping to about $5.			"

												Had this on my wishlist for over a year and the present (Aug 2015) Humble Bundle was kind enough to offer it up.  It in many ways passed my expectations with its beautiful music (love the guitar picking) and great take on a choose your own adventure.  You can blow through the game itself in just under an hour but in truth that fits this game well.  You go through a number of monster life cycle stages and your actions will dictate your monsters personality and ultimate its fate and potentially the world.  As such it approaches things from a childish perspective often which from my perspective is not a complaint but might be for some.   Might be a bit overpriced as while you can replay it I don't believe the quests change.  So yeah there's lots of different endings but even in RPGs i usually stick true to form so having all those choices and endings is great but with no other gameplay to speak of I don't think it would have much value in this case.A great game with wonderful production values and character just probably overpriced at anything over $5 or if you get it in a bundle.  If you like playing all the different outcomes of a Choose Your Own Adventure than it may be worth full price however as it nails that while offering it in a unique and charming perspective/setting.

												As the write up states - it's a choose your own adventure.  The game have basically five phases (birth, child, adolescent, adult, elder).   Each phase has ""mini adventures"" from which to choose and then options within the adventures.  The choices drive your ""personality""  Good - the little adventures are amusing and there's a semi randomness to what gets offered as a selection in each phase that lends to some replayability.  There are 14 possible outcomes for the end game.  It takes about 10-15 hours of game play to achieve all 14 outcomes. My criticism is with the choices lacking materiality on the final outcome.  The choices cause the trait percentages to vary. Basically you get about 30 or so choices and find they lead to one final choice yielding your outcome - you could choose the same 30 adventures/same choices every play through, get to 80% in every trait and about 70% in respect.  (not that you'd do that, but you could and it would not restrict final outcome overly much at all other than neurosurgeon and modest legacy).  Basically the choices at birth/child/teen just arent material enough.  They should cause the final outcomes to be far more restrictve and potentially open up new content.  Instead  all forks in the path lead to what is effectively a common point.  My second criticism would be the elder phase -  the choices are mundane - one choice will pretty much cause How monsters/humans view one another to go up and the other cause it to go down.  The phase is akin to clicking ""help"" or ""sabotage"" buttons 15 times in a row.  The adventures themselves were creative but the choice selections and how they cause """"your own adventure"" to evolve in my view lacked creativity.  Summary - The mini adventures are quite amusing but other aspects of the game are lacking.   For 2-3$ and the replayability of seeing how each choice affects your traits it gets a borderline thumbs up.   "

												If you think it was difficult growing up as a human, just consider how it would have been growing up as a monster. Your life starts in a tank of slime and while growing up you gain different amounts of personality traits (bravery, cleverness, ferocity, honesty, and kindness) and the respect from other monsters based on the desicions you make as monsterling, adolescent and fully grown monster. If you are sufficiently respected you may continue your monster career as an elder, or you get recycled in the tank. You may even go on to achieve great accomplishments in the diplomatic interactions between monsters and men. You can write monster history!Monster Loves You! is a cute little game, or rather a cute little interactive story, where the choices you make matters. It is very nice in small doses, but after a couple of lifetimes the little adventures you experience starts getting a bit repetitive. The same can be said about the music. It is interesting that the way some choices influence the personality are not immediately obvious, but that they start to make sense after a while when more is learnt about monster life. The storyline is inventive and clever and the monsters are cute to look at. Monster Loves You! offers a relaxed escape from the human reality.			"

I ended up thinking it wa fun and interesting, so I continued with my second playthrough, as this games has extremely extensive replayability.

Really, you can't rate this game because it is so extensive that it is like playing a lot of different games. Its all about possibilities.

												I am on the fence for this one since the graphics are cute and there was obviously a lot of love put into making this game.Ultimately I cannot recommend this game for the price given its limited gameplay and repetitiveness. The other reviews explain the mechanics well so I won't dwell on it, but there really should have been more choices available. Most 'levels' have you choose something like 12 or 14 actions out of 15 to 18 options. So even in a single playthrough, you are going through like 80%+ the options. Most actions are not complex enough to have more than 2 or 3 outcomes, so it really limits replayability. It makes completing the primary goal, which is getting all the endings, quite the chore.4/10			"

												I am on the fence for this one since the graphics are cute and there was obviously a lot of love put into making this game.Ultimately I cannot recommend this game for the price given its limited gameplay and repetitiveness. The other reviews explain the mechanics well so I won't dwell on it, but there really should have been more choices available. Most 'levels' have you choose something like 12 or 14 actions out of 15 to 18 options. So even in a single playthrough, you are going through like 80%+ the options. Most actions are not complex enough to have more than 2 or 3 outcomes, so it really limits replayability. It makes completing the primary goal, which is getting all the endings, quite the chore.4/10			"

												This game is too adorable for words, but I'll try.  10/10, great value at 10 dollars.  Excellent soundtrack, and very well written.  Multiple endings, with a good deal of enjoyable replayability!  I highly recommend it to the visual novel crowd.IMAGINE.  You are a monsterling, fresh from the spawning vats.  You will explore a world of monsterly delights.  Will you live a life of kindness, sharing benevolence and healing with your fellow monsters?  Are you an honest creature, to be trusted by your friends and elders by always telling the truth?  Are you a nasty little monster, known by your fellows for intellect, for you tricks, your clever ideas, and wit?  Or will you perhaps be known for you bravery, or your rage and ferocity, trusting in luck and skill to survive the harsh world outside of your monster village?Whichever you choose, if you earn the respect of your fellow monsters and ascend to venerable Elder status, your life could even influence Human/Monster relations!  Be nasty, cruel, helpful or kind; it's your choice!  The world - and your monster - are what you make of it.			"

												Let's start by saying this... ""Monster Loves You!"", despite graphic, is pretty much a text-based game. We are playing as newborn monster. Our decisions will shape his personality, that has five main categories - Bravery, Cleverness, Ferocity, Honesty, Kindness. This stats will then affect our later decisions. Depends on how high they are, we may either be successful or fail miserably choosing our fate. There are three main endings and each of them have few variants, that usually depends on which of our trait is the dominant one.Game is pleasant, but a tad short. Main con is rather low number of situations when our traits are truly put to the test. Also, sometimes options are ambiguous, so when you choose one of them with clear intention in mind, you may find out that it lead to something entirely different - which may be consider good thing and bad thing at the same time.It's a cute game that didn't reach it's full potential. Better buy it as a part of a bundle or during sale.			"

												I've played Monster Loves You! a couple of times now.  It is a cute, bright, interactive story game where your actions from birth and actions/decisions you make while doing tasks determines the kind of monster you are going to be and your influence on other monsters and humanity.  Like others, the game is short, but it is a game I've enjoyed enough to play again.  It's something a bit different and easy going if you fancy a lazy gaming day ;) Will undoubtedly have another play through of it at some point :)			"

												A game that is purely text-based. It is very similar to the old game Alter ego (which you can play for free here: http://www.playalterego.com/alterego). I really love games in which you are responsible for the actions you make. There are every new quest new choices to make. If you decide to be brave you will receive +bravery points. This will have influence on option that are available later on in the game. For example if you want to impress certain Monsters or Humans you need to roll two dices (based on yoru bravery) to see if you are succesful.It is very easy to build up your personality points, and some options are really obvious what the outcome will be. The quests results are a bit predictable at times. But nevertheless it is a cute game which i enjoyed very much. Although for a very short time. You can finish this game in under an hour. Of course there are many other paths to take and endings to see.Pros:- Decisions, decisions, everything comes down to decisions.- Humorous and fun to read.- Different endings.Cons:- Very short.- Decisions have only influence on your personality not on the overal storyline.- Text-based.

												It's more a textual game than anything- so yeah if you love reading you'll find this alright.- there isn't much going on in terms of a visual aspect, you just get similar reactions/images through the game over and over again. music can become highly repetitive but it doesn't mean it's bad. Its mostly ambience.You'll be trying to achieve all the endings - which is about 10 or so... So you're going to basically go through the same basic process over and over again- like for about- 10 times or even more times assuming you might get one repeated ending on acicdent. So after the second trial i was basically breezing through without even reading a good portion of the time excluding the answers I'd assume would give me a specific benefit i was looking for.The games story is a bit childish- yeah. But it's pretty charming and a decent time-passer.Pretty sure if you let a kid play this they'd enjoy it unless they have dyslexia or some sh!t like that.I wouldn't get it on full price- though.

												Hello my name is Gaming crocodile and I must say that this game is a very good one, let me explain:Monster loves you is a choice game, the thing you do in the game is saying how your monster reacts on something.You can be many sort of monster, you can be a bully that is solving his problems by smashing and fighting, or you can be a very kind monster that never lies, that is one of the very good things about monster loves you, there are so many choices!!!About how long the game takes, i play the game in one hour, but it varies. If you read fast you can be faster but if you think about anything it wil take longer. The thing that makes monster loves you so good is that there are 14 endings and I am a person that wants to play all the endings. So if you think it out, 14x1 hour= 14 hours, but some endings are harder to get than others so is the ending where monsters and humans live happy together easier than the ending where you are a docter among humans (the docter ending is very hard!).So my opinion is that this game is great and I think that everyone should play it!!!

												This was pretty much a half-hour long visual novel, but it wasn't anything particularly interesting.  It is a really interesting concept, as you follow a monster from birth to death and help them make decisions in life in a choose-your-own-adventure format, but overall, it fails to deliver much in terms of interesting choices.

												The game promises you can make ""decisions that affect the world of Monsters and Humans."" but none of your monster's decisions in life carry over once they finally reach the end of it.  This game could have been promising if, Crusader Kings style, when playing as a monster born after the previous one the impact of the previous monster could be felt, but every time you start as a new monster, it is as though you had never played the game before.  The game teases social changes in monster society, but since the game never advances forward in time, it's all just window dressing, as no matter what everything will be reset once your current monster dies.  Given that each playthrough is extremely brief, the result is a shallow experience.  Most of the endings are basically stamps for finishing a brief runthrough with a monster who had a certain combination of stats.Your choices in the game affect your monster's personality, but your monster's personality stats do not have much effect overall.  As far as I can tell, when you begin a new game you get a randomly selected monster image to act as your monster's avatar.  Unfortunately, unlike other monster raising games (like the genre-creating Tamagotchi, cutting age software from the year of our lord 1998) your monster's personality and disposition do not affect its appearance.  Your monster's personality stats affect skill checks in the ""Elder"" segment of the game, and in a few places before, but once you get to the Elder segment the game allows you to choose your best stat for use in skill checks, meaning you will pass every one that you attempt.Another complaint is that the game features a few recurring characters, but events show an image of a generic monster whose emotion is meant to represent the emotional energy of the scene.  It would have been nice for these images to show the recurring character that is involved in the scene instead.  This game has a lot going for it - the art is fun and the interface is fine.  The monster society has some fun ideas behind it.  But unless the game can get more interactive, I cannot recommend it to others.			"

												A very simplistic text-based adventure game where you choose your reaction towards different scenarios to gain different properties like kindness, cleverness, ferocity, truthfulness etc. These determine the ending you will get and the choices you can make during the end of the game. Each monster ""life"" in Monster Loves You can be finished in less than 30 minutes. You can tackle different scenarios (which are various but do become repetitive) to get different results but in the end there is not much to this game. The art style is nice although it doesn't animate much at all and everything is pretty static. But the visual style and fonts are at least easy to look at. I can't say if this is suitable material for younger kids because it does have some rather violent imagery brought forth in some of the written scenarios but they never get too serious or morbid. I really don't see any more charm to it.Cute? yes. Mildly interesting? yes. Passable? YES!			"

												Surprisingly difficult to rate this one: it's a standard point-and-click game, fairly short, with your actions throughout the game determining the result you get at the end. If you're using this for say, the 7-11 year old range, it might be workable; however, the various different endings (all of which unlock rewards on Steam) have maybe 2 ""good"" endings, and tons of other ""horrible to varying degrees"" endings, with no clear weight to them other than ""I just got a different ending and a new Steam achievement. Hooray!"" And by ""horrible"", I do mean ""you have to choose the very meanest, most hurtful combination of options presented as actions you are personally deciding to do"", which is why I feel it didn't really suit for a younger audience.I feel it doesn't suit for an older audience, as it wasn't clearly defined just what the Monster race believed in and strove for as a whole: if I am just one of the race, what exactly have my elders and society set out as the norm for behavior? Like I said at the top: suprisingly difficult to rate this super-cartoony, goofy game.			"

I reached the ""best"" ending in under two hours with next to no effort. The $10 entry is much too expensive for this fairly shallow experience.			"

												Got this game figuring it was going to be a charming break from more up beat games. Unfortunately this game is quite the snoozer. The whole game is text based adventure (read&click), no interaction otherwise between characters or environment.  Could not keep myself entertained with this game. You'd be more content reading old goosebumps books.			"

Product received for free
												Received free via Steamified.Overall score 7.5/10 Let me start off by stating that this game plays much like a choose your own adventure book. A very very well done choose your adventure book. It has a ton of compelling visuals that tie a lot of the lore together. THere are a lot of positives about this game: the textual descriptions are detailed and tie the various approaches to the story together. THE main negative to this game, s many have stated, is the length. It is a rather short game for 10 bucks, especially if you're looking to play through it once. It's value lies in multiple playthroughs. Experimenting with different character builds is where this game shines. exploring the different options the game gives you  is a very fun experience. LAthough the gameplay stays very static with no huge mix ups, the varying options given to the player keeps the game from hetting too stale. Overall, it is a well done, if not generic choos your own adventure game.			"

												A quiant little text based choose-your-adventure game. Zero gameplay. Just dialog/action choices. I didn't find the artwork interesting at all. The soundtrack is cute. It's a short game, something like 45 minutes, and they expect you to replay it multiple times to try and cover multiple personalities over the course of multiple monster lives, just to see what happens. It's a silly game, and frankly wasn't worth $2.50. If it was ever like a buck, perhaps.			"

												Monster Loves You! is a cute, whimsical and basically well done Choose Your Own Adventure kind of game, but it is entirely too short.In each phase of the monster's evolution, the player faces a number of ""challenges"" where multiple choice answers slowly form the characteristics of the monster. If it helps others, the kindness stat goes up, if finds good solutions to problems, the cleverness attribute increases. if it flies right into battles with claws extended and teeth exposed, it becomes more ferocious, and so on.In essence, this is the entire game. The graphics are well done and atmospheric, the dialogue is shallow but funny, with plenty of references, but there isn't much actual gameplay here and you'll be through in under two hours.			"

I tried it a couple more times, but was bored, knowing the endings. It's cute drawings and everything, but I just wasn't interested in it.

												I found Monster Loves You to be a fun game that is rather silly as well. The choices you make do matter and effect your endings and you can get multiple endings out of the game. Your monster that you play as can look completely rediculous (in a good way) but does not always match the storyline. ""You shred Nash Nash with your claws."" But a decent number of monsters that you end up with actually have no claws, sometimes not even arms at all! This can be frusturating but it in no ways makes the game unplayable, at least for me. Having a blob for a monster that is supposed to be able to climb, claw, bite and run around is a bit disapointing. I did enjoy the game very much so and will play it again every once in a while just for the memories and fun even though I would know EVERYTHING about the game and have unlocked every ending.			"

												This is a little gem of a game, and I don't say that lightly. It's like baby's first RPG/sim hybrid, a way to whet your appetite before tackling denser games like anything by Black Chicken Studios or heavier visual novels like Analog. But it also has its own merits. The writing is smart and lends itself equally to humor and insight, and occasionally flashes of existential horror, because why not. Do keep in mind that the game IS short and my main criticism is that replayability is hampered by how few scenelets really show up in the storyline. But I'm keeping an eye on this title. Fixes seem to be made pretty frequently.			"

												If you recall the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" or perhaps the ""White Wolf"" game books from the '70's and '80's, then you're on the right track for this game.After a few playthroughs, you'll probably start to recognize some of the options.  This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either.  The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.The soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar  is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well.  A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing).  The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game.  It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.The writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar.  It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child.

												Unlike a majority of games on the market, Monster Loves You is an adventure game where your choices affect your future and reputation. You start off making life choices from the moment you are born until you become an elder. In the end, your actions will affect the outcome of your monster species. A typical playthrough from start to finish will take you no more than about half an hour but the real draw of the game is to see what type of ending you are going to get. In the long run, Monster Loves You will give you a memorable experience but  wont give you a long-lasting one that will leave you wanting to come back to the game more than a handful of times. 73/100			"

It was short and sweet only took about an hour to go from start to finish. But I am already ready to do it again. I got it on sale for 5 bucks and have to say has put at least five dollars worth of a smile on my face.

												Unlike a majority of games on the market, Monster Loves You is an adventure game where your choices affect your future and reputation. You start off making life choices from the moment you are born until you become an elder. In the end, your actions will affect the outcome of your monster species. A typical playthrough from start to finish will take you no more than about half an hour but the real draw of the game is to see what type of ending you are going to get. In the long run, Monster Loves You will give you a memorable experience but  wont give you a long-lasting one that will leave you wanting to come back to the game more than a handful of times. 73/100			"

												Cute little choose your own adventure style game that feels like a nicely written children's story. It's mainly text based with cute artwork and funny scenarios. It even has some touching moments in it. There are 14 different outcomes to your overall choices in the game and while a little repetitive after a while, it's still a fun playthrough at least a few times as you only get to select a handful of situations to act out per level and there will be some you didn't get to try out at each time.

												If you recall the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" or perhaps the ""White Wolf"" game books from the '70's and '80's, then you're on the right track for this game.After a few playthroughs, you'll probably start to recognize some of the options.  This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either.  The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.The soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar  is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well.  A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing).  The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game.  It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.The writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar.  It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child.

												This is a GREAT game. It's a wonderful relaxed and casual game. There are no timers, no bells and whistles, no incoming hoardes of zombies or bullets to count. It's much more like a choose-your-own-adventure book, monster style! From the very beginning of your monster's existence you choose what actions to take in response to various situations, which shapes and forms who this monster is, who they will become, and even the very fate of the monster race! There are so many different combinations and possibilities this game has a lot of replay value. Plus, the music is great, and the pictures are fun. I can see this game being fun for younger audiences as well as long as they have a sense of humor and a parent guiding them along with wise explanations.			"

												One thing you should know before picking this up, is that it's not a game in the traditional sense of the word. It's more of a choose-your-own-adventure kind of thing. There is no platforming, no questing, no inventory, no racing. And that's completely fine.That said, if you've ever enjoyed books that allowed you to choose your own adventure, you're bound to love this. There are a lot of options and outcomes, all done in a cartoonish and clever style. Don't be fooled by the presentation though, this is not quite what you'd call a ""kid's game"".While there is no voice acting, the options you're presented with all have distinct feeling to them, which plays great with idea of shaping your monster from a morsel to an Elder. The various personality traits - such as bravery, ferocity, kindness - increase or decrease depending on your choices. Your options for the final outcome are determined by how high or how low these traits actually are. This also gives MLY plenty fo replaybility, as there are plenty of different outcomes each granting an in-game emblem as well as an achievement. Great for trophy hunters.I definitely recommend getting this if you're looking for something mellow and relaxing to pass time with. Each ""run"" is about 30-60 minutes long, depending on what scenarios you receive and how fast you read.However, know what you're getting into. I cannot stress this enough. Do not get this if you're looking to jump on platforms, or shoot things, or race vehicles - or do anything other than read and choose reactions to the situations presented. It does just this one thing, but it does it really well.			"

												Maybe my expectations were to high, but I was kind of disappointed. It is really just clicking on textboxes to gain ""personality points"" (like ferocity, cleverness, kindness) and in the later rounds ""respect"" and in the third round you can determine by your actions wether humans and monsters like each other. Sadly it´s pretty easy to see through and after a while one can just quit reading the question-box and just click on answers. It´s cute in the beginning but I was bored after about 20 minutes. You just click on ""adventures"" (which you do not have to search for, it´s always on the same position and visible by a big sign) and you can not move or interact with objects. I mean, yeah I wanted a ""brain-off""-game to relax no action and not too much of thinking or complex riddles, but this is just too low and it does not give you (or at least me) any satisfaction.All in all it´s plain clicking on textboxes. Nothing else. "

												I'm not sure if I recommend or not this game, but it has a big disadvantage so I press NO.Here are my reasons:+ AdvantagesThe game is cute, I really love the illustrations for the screens. It also reminds me the old rpg games where reading and choose your option and that leads you to a result or another, but much more visual. Maybe for children is ok, around 10-12 years old, or if you simply love the artwork. I simply bought it because I liked the visual aspect. It's also quite funny thanks to the the stories and situations.- DisadvantagesExpensive for what it offers. It's completely static, you can't do anything to interact, just click the options, not even objects, and til now I only found one end, the rest of the time I just don't grow up and that's all. The price is that big disadvantage for which I pressed NO. I sincerely won't pay for it more than 3€.			"

												I thought this game looked like a bit of fun and I was expecting some sort of gameplay other than just clicking on text to make a decision in what seems to be a game made to teach morals to young kids, if that is what it's intentions are i'd say it's good and kids would enjoy it but for anyone older not so much.I just find myself completeing it over and over again bored of clicking on text just to get some easy acheivements, glad I didn't pay the full amount for it.Wouldn't recommend for anyone say over 12 years of age, maybe younger.If there was a neutral option rather than do you recommend?

												I would say that this game is good for children in the 6 - 10 years age group.  Younger kids could easily play game, since there is no skill involved other than some pretty heavy reading, and older kids would appreciate the humor.  There are several different endings to get if you can stand navigating multiple choice menu after multiple choice menu.  Sure are there a few different ""adventures"" in each level, but there's no interactivity with the environment.			"

												Looked great from the preview, but they forgot to mention that there are no actual gameplay elements.  You make decisions (usually between 2-3 options) and they rather predictably raise or lower one of five metrics (honesty, ferocity, bravery, kindness, respect).  Some decisions lead to chance outcomes, influenced by your metric in those categories.  I played through the entire game in about ten minutes.  It's boring.  Easy to ""win"" and not particularly engaging.			"

												This isn't a game, so much as an interactive story, but it's a fun one! I never gave the game much thought, because the name seemed kinda silly to me, but after getting the game in a Humble Bundle, I decided to check it out. I've gotta say, I enjoyed my first playthrough! If you enjoyed interactive books as a kid, you should definitely check this game out.			"

												This game is a choose your own adventure style game. The mechanics are simplistic and the story is cute. However, the story presuming you progress to the elder stage will take you about 40 minutes. While a nice idea and enjoyable for the short time frame I can not recommend as the game simply asks you to replay it to get all the endings... Not worth the time.  "

												This game isn't for me. I don't like it, I thought it was going to be something different. But it was recommended to me by a friend so I bought it (in 2013).I don't recommend it because I just didn't find anything about it fun or entertaining, personally. The limited customization didn't make up for the various outcomes in the story-line, and the story itself was just too dull for me. The challenges weren't challenging in the right way.You make a little monster and answer questions that make up a story and your decisions affect the outcome. That's all I can tell you, because I only played it once YEARS ago and didn't get very far before I closed the game and never played it again. Most of my time was actually AFK.At the time Steam didn't offer returns/refunds, so I uninstalled it and forgot about it. Now, however, I'm stuck with the game since the purchase was made so long ago (even though I have the less than 2 hours played requirement and the last date played is the same as the purchase date...sigh). PLEASE UNDERSTAND I'm not saying this is a bad game; it has great reviews. But it's an ill fit for me, and one glance at my game library would tell you why.  So if you're not sure about this game, do some research before purchasing and don't screw yourself out of a refund should you change your mind afterwards.			"

												   Monster loves you eh?   Yet another odd game but that doesn't make it a bad game. You start of in a cauldron of goo and work your way up to adulthood. The game itself is as short as that description. The first time I finished it it took me just under an hour. That's the main drawback of the game, short as hell.   Monster loves you is a Visual Novel. The art although I regret not getting to see much of it during the story, mainly because the dialog boxes covered the images is what you would find in a children's book but not to childish to stop anyone else from playing it in that regard.    What do you get to do? All you do is click dialog boxes. What do these boxes contain? Text of course. Just joking. This is the core of the game. You grow up based on the choices you made starting from day 1. The shortness of the game is countered by a decent ammount of choices that you get.   Verdict time. I for one got this on a -50% sale and got exactly what I signed up for. An amusing story that did not drag on to the point clicking a dialog box becomes a chore. I couldn't wait to click and read what my choice did and let me tell you, some of the choices you get to make are either hillarious on their own or the result is.   If I were to give it a score I would go for around 8 / 10, and as always that's the grade according to how much they achieved and how much more they could have.			"

												Monster Loves You! is nothing too special. There's not really much to talk about, either. Normally, you'd talk about gameplay. But there is none. The entire game is text-based, and all you do is pick certain ways to deal with situations the game throws at you during your life as a monster. So right off the bat, there's something of a letdown. Visually, it also isn't too stunning. There are some nice drawings here and there, but the environments and your characters seem a bit bland. The music is also forgetable. The only thing this game has going for it is its witty dialogues. And the fact that there's 14 endings, so there's quite a bit of replay value. But not too much. I've spent 8.2 hours on this game and got all of the endings. I'm not saying I didn't enjoy playing it, because it does have a certain charm, but I can think of countless other games that cost less, yet blow this one out of the water.			"

												The first video game I played was GTA3, all the way back in 2001, on the PS2. I didn't enjoy it very much (and still don't enjoy GTA-style games in general). The second game I ever played was much better - Age of Empires 2, on the PC. Why do I bring this up? Because it's important to note that I started playing video games well beyond the era of the text-based adventures and RPG's of the 80's. Which is important to note because Monster Loves You! is essentially a text-based adventure game, albiet one that doesn't require typing and has a graphical interface.It's definitely a solid game, with a clearly defined goal that you're working towards, and it's probably the right length for a modern text-based adventure. The graphical interface is cutesy enough, and is very effective in capturing the player's interest. The game also successfully incorporates some clever RPG-like stat-building, with a series of stats that can be raised or lowered depending on the conversation options the player chooses. All these elements combine into a lighter game that will be enjoyed more by casual gamers than those that play more seriously.Which is why I can't recommend this game; most people on Steam simply won't enjoy it for long enough to get their money's worth. While I enjoyed it, that was only for 51 minutes; I have no desire to play through the game again. That's not the fault of the game, moreso the fault of the genre. Gamers have simply moved on from the days of the text-based adventure, and now prefer their RPG stats to be accomponied by a 3-dimensional world that they experience through the eyes of a character they make. If you enjoy text-based adventures or more casual games, than this is a game that you'll get multiple hours of enjoyment from. Otherwise, the stat-building and graphical depiction of the story simply won't be enough to keep you captivated beyond the first playthrough.			"

												You emerge from the womb presented with three dialog options. We’re not talking ‘red blue or green’ and we’re certainly not talking ‘attack defend or route.’ Your choices are some meandering fancy like “scoop up slime, hold your breath, or call for help.” Welcome to Monster Loves You, where dialog choices comprise the whole of the gameplay. Revel in stat bonuses for choosing the right option —it’s always the right option— and accrue new dialog choices based on your newfound stats. But watch out! Don’t get enough stats —it’s never enough— and you will unknowingly close yourself off from other dialog options.If you think that choosing an option is actual gameplay, this is the game for you! It’s like Final Fantasy X’s combat with none of the consequences or combat. If you want to be mentally stimulated then this is not the Cart Life for you. I think this game is actually for kids. Like the literal kind of children, not the autismal man kind. Cute 4 girls but you know what? Girls want to play a video game. You know casual appeal of Bejewel and Peggel where you choose a touch and stuff goes? In Monster Loves You there is choose a touch but then you just choose more and more touch. Monster does not even love you until late-game. Has:- Artistic Direction- Be your own monster!- Touch or mouse.

												Live the life of a Monster, from birth to elderhood and beyond, making decisions that affect the world of Monsters and Humans. You live in the village of Omen, and your favorite snack is the fingers of small children. As a Monster, you pop up in the most interesting places — what do you do when three angry bears discover a young child in their cabin? Or when you spy a wolf hunting down that woman with the red cloak? As a Monsterling, your choices are simple ones. Do you chase those poor little mice (+1 Ferocity) or protect them from the dogs (+1 Kindness)? Do you come clean about that fungus your friends ate (+1 Honesty) or cover for them (+1 Bravery)? As a youth, your choices determine your personality. But all youngins must grow up. Monsters and Humans have been at odds for centuries, and there are Human villages on the other side of the enchanted woods. When Human children get lost in those dark and winding thickets, do you terrorize them for fun (+1 Ferocity)? Do you help return them to Human civilization to prove that not all Monsters are to be feared and hated (+1 Kindness)? Or do you fatten them up for Human foie gras — a Monster delicacy? All this, to the backdrop of increasing tensions between Monster- and Humankind.			"

												I had to pay DOUBLE for it as the copy I had in my steam inventory magically vanished. (Checked my trade history, nobody had used my account).That aside, per playthough, it's usually an hour. First playthrough I managed to get humans and monsters to co-operate. You're given various options which fill meters of sorts that change the outcomes in the later games. It's got great replayability, as you can choose to be a good monster (helping people) or a bad one (snacking on little fat kids who are lost) and these options open up greater choices. It's a charming little game.			"

												This is a ridicoulouse amount for the asking price, i got it for roughly $3.50 with a coupon and i still feel like it wasn't worth it. Not a bad game just way to short, takes 2 hours to beat it and the achievments broke for me as well so there's no reason for me to ever play it again. Unless achievments get fixed. I had to force myself to keep playing on my 2nd try and there's no way im going to be playing for a third. It doesn't have much depth either. The only way chosing different choices effects you is by percentages of respect and other stats you acquired which in the end just basically decide what choices you CAN make (Without high chance of fail).Overall 2/10 fun the first time but way to expensive considering.

												Worst game ever imagined. Definitely dreamed up by Uber Progressive Phonies who feel accomplishing and succeeding is a reason to feel guilty and ashamed.Very subliminal Propaganda work to anyone who spends enough time playing it to get the point of the reward and punishment system set up in the ?game?Underhanded Propaganda that is unprecedented in video game history. very sneaky agenda that only rewards you for following an Uber Progressive Fabian Society agenda. If you want to know what your kids are up against with Common Core and the indoctrination of the Federal Education System then just play this game for a few minutes and you will burn your computer.This game is an affront to free will and self responsibility It is an obvious and blatant  an attempt to manipulate anyone foolish enough to not have dreams or anything to stand for. It will appeal to the mindless and lazy college crowd who are stupid enough to believe in Global Warming without taking the time to research Historical facts about geological trends on this planet.If you like this game than you ARE the problem..

												7.5/10A nice multiple choice game with a high replay value due to its actual shortness (5 to 15 minutes per playthrough, depending on certain choices and the amount of text you get to read)But that's okay, because then you can start all over, make different choices and get completely different results:• Lecture fellow monsters about the dangers of human tools OR convince them that not everything human-made is THAT bad.• Comfort a grieving woman OR just eat her.• Scare away birds from some bread crumbs and eat those OR follow the crumbs to a strange little house made of gingerbread. *hint hint*• End the feud between monsters and humans OR go to war and either get killed, enslaved or succeed and become the new ruler of the world.All of this is just ""shown"" in textual form (nope, no animated cutscenes and no running around, just reading, choosing, clicking, reading, choosing and clicking), but it's still a lot of fun when you get to read the results of your doings:________________________[Eat some monkey poop.]WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT!?________________________Sadly, the best choices will get stuck in your head and you'll just click through everything in less than 5 minutes before you start a new game again, but that's only the case if you don't care about the different endings, because getting those is the actual challenge (which adds even more replay value).

												This is a cute, short, text-based, choose your own adventure story game. I feel people have been a bit harsh about it, so I'm going to give my honest thoughts. Note: I picked this up in the humble bundle, so I didn't pay full price for it (technically). PROS -Cute art style! Very kid friendly and appealing. It's endearing. I wish there was MORE art to look at though, as most of the game is text based. I could see this being a book series for kids! :)-Simple and easy to follow, again it's very kid friendly. I didn't have any confusion or difficulty understanding what to do, and the text is written in easy enough terms. However, it's not ""too simple.""-More on the story text. It goes into just enough detail to weave together a nice story, without being overly complex. It's all about monsters so it can be a bit ""gross"" and ""cartoonish violence"" at times, but it's not disturbing or anything. It has a very whimsical charm to it. I know I've said this already, but it's probably aimed more for 8-12 yr old age range. But as a 25 yr old adult, I still enjoyed it. :)-Multiple endings and many personal choices. I had fun seeing 2 different endings. It's short enough to run through 2-3 times in one night if you felt like it. So it wouldn't be too much for a kid to handle. CONS -As I said.... it's for kids. So you might not enjoy it fully as an adult. The dialogue, story, art etc. is all aimed for a younger audience. -That said, the multiple choice endings are a bit shallow. There's no real point playing more than 2-3 times. I don't see myself grinding for achievements.-It's more of a visual novel then a game. There's minimal animations, which is a shame because the art style is very charming. It's mostly just point n click, reading text, and using your imagination (which is not so much of a bad thing!) OVERALL SCORE: 7/10 I'd pick this up on sale, if you have kids, or are new to the whole idea of choice based story games. It's a simple and cute way to get into the genre. I could definitely see myself digging this back when I was a kid too, and I still dig it now!			"

												A game that draws you in with its cute visuals and promise of story, Monster Loves You! was an overall disappointing experience. I have played games that are so repetitive and it can be done well ,ex: Binding Of Isaac, but I have never played a game that got so boring so fast. This game only use is for let's players on youtube who only have to play the game once and never touch it again. Despite being a game you are supposed to run through multiple times, I got bored of it before I even finished my first playthrough. All the options that determine your traits are exactly the same and lack any variety. Your efforts to actually ""beat"" the game comes down to chance and is independant of anything you actually do in the entire game. Perhaps this game would be more enjoyable to a younger audience but the lack of changing gameplay, borderline soporific storyline, and limited replayablility makes Monster Loves You! a game I wouldn't play even once if it was free.

To be feared, to be respected, to be looked down and much more.  The choices are very obvious like to either help out someone, to mess it up for that someone or to EAT that someone. I know, sounds exciting isnt it?

												This is a cute game, not high action (the entire game is reading text and clicking options), but cute and relaxing. It is however fairly short; if you go for all of the endings/achievements, it will only take about 5 or 6 hours. After the first couple of times through it if you are just aiming for all of the endings you can basically speed click through all of the text as you won't be seeing anything new. I'd still recommend it, but not at the full price. I bought it on sale and it was worth the $2.50 I spent, and if it was say $5 I'd say it's also worth that much, but I personally do not think it's $10 worth of entertainment.

Monster Loves You! offers a good time of easy and fun gameplay that is suitable for most ages. If you're looking for a calmer game to unwind with, this is what you're looking for!			"

												""Monster Loves You!"" is a fun, short game in the style of a ""choose your own adventure"" novel. You begin life in a bizzare monster birth from a vat of slime, and progress through senility (if you live that long). While fun and interesting at first, this game quickly becomes repetetive and is easily completed in less than half an hour if you read fast. I've played the game about an hour or so total, and I've beaten it at least three times. Once you've beaten the game once, you can play through it again rather quickly, as many of the options are the same throughout the game and once you've read them the first time, there's no real reason to read them again. All in all, it's a fun time waster, but with limited replay value. I recommend it if you can find it on sale and want a VERY light visual novel to play around with. It's a lot of fun and there are some good humorous bits, but overall it's a pretty ordinary game.--------------------------------------------------------------------If you enjoy my reviews, why not follow my curation page?

												I set out to play Monster Loves You! with a little bit of disdain. I'd seen the screenshots, and the whole thing just looked very bland and childish. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was wrong. Monster Loves You! is a story-driven choice-based game where you play a newborn monster. You're tasked with answering a few questions and solving a few problems in order to determine a personality. Your personality is essentially your skills, and how you answer the problems and questions will determine your skill level. The skills are things like Honesty, Bravery, etc. and will be increased/decreased by how you respond to situations in the game. It's cute enough, with a decent story model, but it wears thin a little quick for my tastes. Definitely enjoyed my time playing it so far, however.			"

												It is a cute game. Providing many possiblities, but in the end, there is not much choice to make, sadly. The game provides many situations where there is a definitively favourable option. Also your options aren't clearly stated, small pictograms that mostly won't give any information away what quest you're about to apply to, making the encouraged min-maxing a matter of making notes. Still, the monsters are adorable. Maybe not the right thing if you're in search of self-fulfilment, but most probably suitable for a younger audience.			"

												A Choose-Your-Own Adventure game where you play as a newly formed monster. Every decision you make decides your temperament: Kind, Honest, Brave, Clever, or Ferocious, and how much other monsters or the humans respect you. As simple as the game sounds, it actually is enjoyable. The short stories where you make your choices are all pretty amusing, and each choice gives you very different results. Unfortunately if you're going for all of the achievements, you will start repeating these stories. There are enough stories for a playthrough or two (maybe three), but the achievements take 14 playthroughs. Fourteen. By the time I reached the last few I wasn't even reading the stories because I had memorised their symbols.Other than that, I did really enjoy the game, and if you remember reading those old choose-your-own-adventure books and liking them, then you'll probably enjoy this too.

												A cute little CYOA that emphasizes replayability... despite holding absolutely no replay value. The choices you make affect the ending and your character's responses to situations. The situations themselves, however, are all short vignettes, and almost entirely static. Once you've seen one ending, there's little incentive to play through and see another. Additionally, the scenarios get repetitive and predictable very quickly, and even the most extreme of options have no lasting or meaningful effects.I would recommend this on sale for about a dollar.

												This is a very simple game.  It could be classified as ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" basically but it is cute.  You get to choose a bunch of storylines that are quite cute (or slightly frightening) and watch your monster grow up.  Each game your monster will grow up to be a little different as well so you have the visual change too.This isn't a play for several hours game, you can beat it in about 10-15 minutes in fact and get all the achievements in much less time, but it is a cute, little thing to spend some time with.

However, it would have benefited from allowing save games so you could save-scum your way into many of the endings (without having to start over each time).

												I was looking for something that would make me emotional or something and I found this. I downloaded it and ten minutes later, I'm not impressed. The game requires no skill or thought, you just choose. I'm not talking about it being easy, i mean no matter what you do you can't get hurt or lose. You just gain ""Bravery"" or some other stat. You can't actually see whats going on either, and as much as I like text-based adventures this is noooot a good one. You just choose the good option in your mind and you get points. Instead of buying this game, ask yourself ""If i was a monster, would i be mean or nice?"" and answer that. Thats. It. You've gotten the same results. (Also, ten minutes in and im on the 2nd stage, so it's not going to be a long game)			"

												A heartwarming, or sometimes, gut wrenching tale of the lifes and times of a monster. The kind of monster that monster is can vary entirely dependent on what you do and how you do it, it could be a great big baby eating ogre, a sly trickster, a slithering horror that subtly changes the world behind the scenes, a big though kind hearted beast or even a secretive doctor. It's a feel good game that feels good, and really I think is best served if you just dive into the whimsical tale without any expectations or achivement hunting or anything else, just letting the little fuzzy tale wash over you like a storybook from when you where a child.

												:MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS:This game is very unique. The art and soundtrack are charming, the story is intriguing, and it's very replayable. There isn't really much for gameplay, being that the game is mostly decision making, which is by no means a bad thing. It'll take you at least a while to get all the endings, and even then there is just a bunch of different things that can happen. The writing is very humorous and clever, and the whole style of the game is charming. There are 5 different stages in this game: Morsel, Kid, Adolescent, Adult, and then Elder. Each of them have some differences. The 1st stage is very short, and will also determine a large part of what happens later in the game. The second stage doesn't have any major twists, although your traits (kindness, cleverness, honesty, etc.) will develop much more rapidly, which makes this a good chance to get a headstart on what traits you want more of. The third stage is much like the previous, but the story is more open, because you aren't in the brood cave the whole time like you were in the second stage. This stage takes a few more days and you become a little bit less impressionable, as well as it being much more likely to lose parts of your traits as well as gain them. There is a few chances of respect being earned in this stage, but it will not be majorly used until adulthood and elder. Similar to the other stages, the fourth stage takes the longer than any of the other ones. This stage is more free because you can decide whether to socialize with other monsters, or go out and adventure. During this stage you will be much less impressionable, and your traits will probably stay mostly the same. You will also rack up respect. Respect is very important as in most cases, it will determine your fate. Once adulthood is over, you will start to realize that your life is coming to an end and you have to make a few decisions, if you want to try to live, if you will dissolve, if you will ascend, etc. Once you go back to the spawning vat you will be confronted by elders. You can dissolve, or try to ascend into an elder. This part is kind of complicated, so I'll just sum it up. If you dissolve you will end your game right there, but if you try to become an elder you will have a chance to be tested. If you fail the test or dissolve, you will dissolve, but if you complete the test you will move onto being an elder. Once you become an elder, it's up to you to determine whether to fight the humans, make peace, etc. (Or become a neurosurgen.) This stage is probably the most unique for a few reasons. It adds two new factors, Humans opinion on monsters and vice versa. By the end of the stage the percentages and a few last decisions will determine how the game ends. Besides that, most decisions will require a trait. So you will have a better chance to complete something that requires more ferocity if you have 90% compared to 30%, adding a more rpgish aspect into the game, making the elder stage even more interesting.Sorry if this was more a guide than it was a review, but I hope it helps. This game is great, and I really love a lot about it. Of course there are downsides to a few things, like not as much character establishment, and things like that. Another thing about the game is that the story is VERY open-ended, almost everything is determined through your choices, which might explain why there's not as much character development. Other then that, this is a very unique concept and was very well executed. The game is charming, funny, replayable, and even at some times heartwrenching. And I would love to see a sequel to this game, because it really deserves it. It's definitely worth the money, so buy it and give it a try.			"

												The nice thing about Monster Loves You! is that it's not for you as a seasoned gamer, but for your children (with or without your help).You start your journey in a pool of goo, and from that slimy craddle to your comfy grave, you're confronted to numerous adventurous situations, in which you'll have to decide how you will react. Depending on your choices (presented as text options) you'll progress into branched mini-stories, receiving or losing points in a serie of traits like Bravery, Cleverness, Cruelty, Kindness and so forth.From an adult perspective, the game might seem unchallenging and you'll really enjoy the last part, dedicated to politics and community management. But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.The art is cartoony and childish (of course), and the langage proper to the young audience. Even if the total play time for a character's life is short (about an hour), it's possible to come back once in a while to have fun guiding another creature in the path you've chosen.			"

												This is a digital create your own adventure book with many many amusing monster adventures to be had. Each play through is fairly short so there is reasonable replayability. The decisions you make affect stats which affect what stories and endings are available so it is not as straight forward as choose X for ending Y. This is fun as it is your overall approach to the various adventures which determines what ending you get, this is great unless you are obsessively trying to get all the endings and keep getting up getting one you have previously gotten instead of the one you want. It is a single player game but it is also quite fun to play with a friend because you can share the decision making and enjoy the consequences and humour together.			"

												It's a fun idea, but essential a text-game with a few background graphics thrown in.  It's also very short with less re-play potential than it promises.  It's not expensive, but even so, it feels a bit over-priced for what you actually get.I wish I'd given this one a miss, personally.			"

												Monster Loves You! is a decision based adventure game which is best described if you remember those old Choose Your Own Adventure Books from around the 80's, where you had a story written down in this book and once in a while you have a choice to make that leads you to different pages and different continuation of the storyline. But Back to the Here and Now.GameplayThe Gameplay is more like a classic text adventure. Much to read and at the end you get a collection of things your character can do. For better visualisation you have beautiful handdrawn background, depending on your current location. To make every choice in this game more worthwhile (and to compansate the missing feature of running around in the world and exchanging things for something you could actually use on your adventure) there is a little stats-based system build into it. Nothing much, it keeps track of various characteristica that change depending on the decisions you make. And it actually doesn't do anything else in the game, it's only needed at the end to calculate which ending you will receive, which can range from tragic to hilarious, if you play your cards right. But more of that later.StoryYou start your adventure in a giant green pool of goo. Soon you will grow arms, and legs, and wings? Maybe. You can help those little things around you, or just eat them. And when you have grown strong enough you will embark from the slimy goo, seeing the light of the sun for the first time, and begin your new life as a little Monsterling.The Story follows you through your life from a little monsterling to your adulthood and eventually your death (and even beyond if you meet certain criteria). In every life stage you receive a collection of adventures you can go on, each one takes a day from your clock until it's time to grow up. But careful here. You have more adventures than days, so you can't take on all of them, the adventures are only presented as icons, and many adventures share the same icon. So you can only guess what you will encounter there. This system will go through all 3 life stages. As little monsterling you learn the ropes of being a monster and rarely leave you broodchamber. During your childhood / Teenager times you learn something about the outside world and how dangerous and fascinating humans can be. Those humans should be on a modern day level. Your adulthood begins with an initiation rite to determine what kind of task you will do in the monsterworld. It's calculated from the stats you build up in your life, but doesn't add anything to your further adventure. You just live your life and do tasks inside and outside of the monster settlement. At the End it's time for you to return to the pool of goo you came from and pass on your memories to the monsters of the next generation. Or, if you did something right with your life, you may receive an oppurtunity to become an elder and just maybe doing some great deeds out there.ConclusionWhat you can expect from Monster Loves You! is a fairytale like adventure game which let you see such stories from quite a different perspective. And maybe you encounter characters like Puss in Boots, or Hänsel and Gretel. The Art is exceptionally well made and the fact that each playthrough will have different adventures and outcomes you gain a certain replaybility. So give it a try and choose your own little twisted fairytale.If you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:http://youtu.be/pX7Gbe8U7gI?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuAFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:http://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/ "

												A very well done ""Build your adventure by making choices"" game.The game in summary is you as the player controlling the monsterling from birth to its adulthood.The game requires you to stop, read and think to let you achieve what you want to be as a monster. To be feared, to be respected, to be looked down and much more.  The choices are very obvious like to either help out someone, to mess it up for that someone or to EAT that someone. I know, sounds exciting isnt it? XDThe achievements are pretty good too, require you to play the game multiple times to get different endings and can take quite a few hours to complete it.The game is still pretty short, but im not complaning.

												A game that draws you in with its cute visuals and promise of story, Monster Loves You! was an overall disappointing experience. I have played games that are so repetitive and it can be done well ,ex: Binding Of Isaac, but I have never played a game that got so boring so fast. This game only use is for let's players on youtube who only have to play the game once and never touch it again. Despite being a game you are supposed to run through multiple times, I got bored of it before I even finished my first playthrough. All the options that determine your traits are exactly the same and lack any variety. Your efforts to actually ""beat"" the game comes down to chance and is independant of anything you actually do in the entire game. Perhaps this game would be more enjoyable to a younger audience but the lack of changing gameplay, borderline soporific storyline, and limited replayablility makes Monster Loves You! a game I wouldn't play even once if it was free.

												In a word Monster Loves You is delightful.It's an old school ""choose your own adventure story"" with an interactive twist.  Your monster earns trait points and respect for the things they do and how they choose to approach them--and sometimes you choose poorly.A monster lifetime will take you about 30-60 minutes to play through.  Different scenarios will present themselves--some of which are referred to later on.  The stories are delightful.  They fit in to fairy tales and it's suitable for children--though there is a death component to the game.The music is breezy and sets the mood.

												A cute, relaxing little game. There's not much to the storyline: This is a simple text-based Choose Your Own Adventure that allows you to roleplay through a limited number of story endings. The actions are light-hearted, and each choice can be easily ""fixed"" or negated if you're unhappy with its result. It's good for a laugh. The calming music is honestly the best part. This may be a good game for people with anxiety who need a quick distraction at night. It doesn't take much attention of commitment to play, so it's easy to spend a few minutes clicking through the story and letting the music do its work.$9.99 is a rather steep price tag for such a simple game, though. I'm glad that I bought this on sale and only shelled out $2.50. It wouldn't have been worthwhile to spend any more money than that.			"

The game poses many situations you must choose from a list of options to solve, each of which usually change one or more of your stats such as bravery, cleverness, or honesty.  You also have an ongoing respect stat that affects how your monsterkind treat you and how likely they are to follow under your leadership.  As a monster you undergo many phases of life all culminating with a large conflictual theme in the end that you must resolve. Choose your own adventure, monster-style.			"

												This is a casual, interactive novel, not an actual game, you play as a newly spawned monster and through your actions decide what kind of monster you will become, which also affects your reputation and how much the other monsters will respect you.The game play consists of choice and consequence but in a lighthearted way (except towards the end if you become an  elder). There are several ""quests"" or choices that come up which vary with each playthrough and are specific to the life stage of your monster, and the game has multiple endings.On the whole this is a cute, fun and at times funny game, but if you are trying to get all the endings I'd recommend leaving the game awhile inbetween each playthrough. The reason is that even though you don't always get the same quests, after awhile they do start to repeat...so after the first couple of playthroughs it gets a bit, well, repetitive . Not only that but there is no save feature, meaning that to get every ending you have to play through the entire game each time. Otherwise this is a quirky and enjoyable choose your own adventure and definitely worth a look, especially if you can catch it on sale.			"

												This game is so cute! Its a choose your own storyline type of game, and you choose different scenarios and actions that help you develop your personality and grow into different types of monsters to see if you will become an elder, or die. There are different outcomes and its pretty replayable since the game isn't that long. Its definitely recommended (buy it on sale) and it'll be a cute game to play.			"

												At a base level, face value and not entirely accurate analogy, I can summarize Monster Loves You by saying ""It's a text-based Spore.""Each session of the game is relatively brief, and after a while, previous options will start to re-surface, but this game is amazing and it's easy to enjoy, easy to play, and not boring, due to its replayability.Given what a cute game this is, with such simple, fun art, I was surprised at how graphic it sometimes got. The monsters do some pretty horrific things sometimes.But this game is cute and there are so many possibilities.Some parts, like the vastly important coming-of-age parts where you continue to grow up, are very touching. I love the music that accompanies your trials and choices in this specific section of the game, and the minor existential crisis you experience during and after about how we are nothing but specks of dust on a speck of dust, leaving no more purpose than this virtual monster does in its world after death.You can also view what endings you've gotten so far in the game on the title page, which helps you know how much of the game you've completed.

												It's a fun little game. It has nice artwork, the text is often funny and it has an interesting storyline. It plays like a choose your own adventure book. You can guide your monster to become friendly, clever, ferocious, cruel and a few other options. You can decide how your tribe of monsters deals with the humans they share the land with. The downide is that the game is quite short and doesn't really have a lot of replay value. You can unlock different endings if you wish but after that you basically know everything the game has to offer. I would not get this at full price, if it is on sale for at least a 50% discount it might be a fun and entertaining way to spend an afternoon.  "

												Monster Loves You! is one of the most interesting games that I've ever played. The quality of the game feels like something similar to Telltale Games (and that's a good thing). The makers of this game put in many different paths into this game so that you can get a different end result for every different response that you give to a situation. For example, I chose the honest path and was rewarded with a nice ending. You can choose to be mean to other monsters or be loving, choose between being nice to humans or tricking your fellow monsters into thinking that they're evil. Overall, this is an incredible game and I would highly suggest buying it. I got this as a part of the Humble Bundle and I wasn't 100% sure what I was getting. When I played this game today for the 1st time, I was throughly impressed. I guarantee it that you'll be too.			"

												It is a cute game. Providing many possiblities, but in the end, there is not much choice to make, sadly. The game provides many situations where there is a definitively favourable option. Also your options aren't clearly stated, small pictograms that mostly won't give any information away what quest you're about to apply to, making the encouraged min-maxing a matter of making notes. Still, the monsters are adorable. Maybe not the right thing if you're in search of self-fulfilment, but most probably suitable for a younger audience.			"

												Monster Loves You! is definitely fun in its own way, especially if you're used to games like dating sims or visual novels (despite this containing no dating at all and a very loose, not-100%-linear plot), but it's pretty lightweight. Basically: good way to kill a few hours here and there, extremely good game to give to kids (especially if you want to induct them into visual novels/text adventures later), cute artwork, cute writing, but can get a bit repetitive after multiple playthroughs. (Again, though, if you give this to a kid then they probably won't care.) Buy it, have fun with it, get vaguely annoyed at the fact that you can't customise your monster, but don't expect too much. 6.5/10			"

												Monster Loves You! is a decision based adventure game which is best described if you remember those old Choose Your Own Adventure Books from around the 80's, where you had a story written down in this book and once in a while you have a choice to make that leads you to different pages and different continuation of the storyline. But Back to the Here and Now.GameplayThe Gameplay is more like a classic text adventure. Much to read and at the end you get a collection of things your character can do. For better visualisation you have beautiful handdrawn background, depending on your current location. To make every choice in this game more worthwhile (and to compansate the missing feature of running around in the world and exchanging things for something you could actually use on your adventure) there is a little stats-based system build into it. Nothing much, it keeps track of various characteristica that change depending on the decisions you make. And it actually doesn't do anything else in the game, it's only needed at the end to calculate which ending you will receive, which can range from tragic to hilarious, if you play your cards right. But more of that later.StoryYou start your adventure in a giant green pool of goo. Soon you will grow arms, and legs, and wings? Maybe. You can help those little things around you, or just eat them. And when you have grown strong enough you will embark from the slimy goo, seeing the light of the sun for the first time, and begin your new life as a little Monsterling.The Story follows you through your life from a little monsterling to your adulthood and eventually your death (and even beyond if you meet certain criteria). In every life stage you receive a collection of adventures you can go on, each one takes a day from your clock until it's time to grow up. But careful here. You have more adventures than days, so you can't take on all of them, the adventures are only presented as icons, and many adventures share the same icon. So you can only guess what you will encounter there. This system will go through all 3 life stages. As little monsterling you learn the ropes of being a monster and rarely leave you broodchamber. During your childhood / Teenager times you learn something about the outside world and how dangerous and fascinating humans can be. Those humans should be on a modern day level. Your adulthood begins with an initiation rite to determine what kind of task you will do in the monsterworld. It's calculated from the stats you build up in your life, but doesn't add anything to your further adventure. You just live your life and do tasks inside and outside of the monster settlement. At the End it's time for you to return to the pool of goo you came from and pass on your memories to the monsters of the next generation. Or, if you did something right with your life, you may receive an oppurtunity to become an elder and just maybe doing some great deeds out there.ConclusionWhat you can expect from Monster Loves You! is a fairytale like adventure game which let you see such stories from quite a different perspective. And maybe you encounter characters like Puss in Boots, or Hänsel and Gretel. The Art is exceptionally well made and the fact that each playthrough will have different adventures and outcomes you gain a certain replaybility. So give it a try and choose your own little twisted fairytale.If you want to get a better look at a playthrough of this game just click the link below:http://youtu.be/pX7Gbe8U7gI?list=UUMxIS2guRxfCuJ1gllMecuAFor more Reviews visit my Blog at:http://achievementunlockblog.wordpress.com/home/ "

												I set out to play Monster Loves You! with a little bit of disdain. I'd seen the screenshots, and the whole thing just looked very bland and childish. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I was wrong. Monster Loves You! is a story-driven choice-based game where you play a newborn monster. You're tasked with answering a few questions and solving a few problems in order to determine a personality. Your personality is essentially your skills, and how you answer the problems and questions will determine your skill level. The skills are things like Honesty, Bravery, etc. and will be increased/decreased by how you respond to situations in the game. It's cute enough, with a decent story model, but it wears thin a little quick for my tastes. Definitely enjoyed my time playing it so far, however.			"

												Monster Loves You is a choose your own adventure game, that lasts for about an hour. You can just one of the best endings in just under an hour. Ten dollars is not worth an hour of entertainment when I can get probably about 5 hours from paying ten at a movie theater. 3/10.			"

												While I've enjoyed story driven choose-your-own adventure games before, it's the lack of concequences or branching paths that turns ""Monster loves You"" into a shallow, stat driven experience. Being short and shallow is forgivable, but an added lack of replayability should put anyone off the 10 euro price tag.In any other story game, what you do locks you into a distinct route through the story. Befriended a certain character, choose to pick up a sword and take the route through the creepy forest? You can be sure that character will remember, you're more likely to become a swordfighter and you might learn something in the forest that you can use later on. Sure, there might be some statistics involved, as you'll need strength to handle your sword and maybe at least 20+ survivalism to make it through the forest, but these are the things that bind you to the story. It sets you on a certain path that creates a mood, an understanding of the world, expectation of what happens next and gets you exclusive endings unavailable somewhere else that makes you feel like it was worth investing. It makes you feel the game/story recognizes you and entertains you with how it accomadates your unique choices and personality. Monster loves You has none of that. The game has three to four chapters, one for each stage of your life. In each stage, you have the choice out of some 20 adventures, with you having the time to go on some 12. All of them are already unlocked straight from the get go and they have no bearing on what kind of monster you are or on what what choices you've made before as a story. Being the goal of the game, they each raise your stats by a bit and by the third chapter certain adventures require your stats to be at a certain level before you can succeed to gain... more stats. By the fourth chapter, you can proceed to use your stats to crudely manipulate the outcome of the game and get the different endings by... raising or lowering new stats with the correct stats. You can randomly kill one day and spare the other. You can get nearly killed by humans at the start of your life and then get a happy ending with the humans at the end, without any explanation. It just is... because of stats. Other monsters don't actively recognize your past actions. As long as you pick the right buttons to make the correct gauges go up, and regardless of who you are, you can work yourself up towards any available outcome. Sure, sticking to a specific personality gets you furthest, but only because you can't possibly level all the stats and being consistent at least raises enough of them to succeed to pass checks. It deprives the game of personality and the feeling you're interacting with a living world, when the two of you simply don't react to each other in a way that is based on story. That said, the game looks okay if you like the artstyle and I can vouch that the writing is actually kind of great, but as a game or an interactive story, it fails abysmally with shallow mechanics.

												I was looking for something that would make me emotional or something and I found this. I downloaded it and ten minutes later, I'm not impressed. The game requires no skill or thought, you just choose. I'm not talking about it being easy, i mean no matter what you do you can't get hurt or lose. You just gain ""Bravery"" or some other stat. You can't actually see whats going on either, and as much as I like text-based adventures this is noooot a good one. You just choose the good option in your mind and you get points. Instead of buying this game, ask yourself ""If i was a monster, would i be mean or nice?"" and answer that. Thats. It. You've gotten the same results. (Also, ten minutes in and im on the 2nd stage, so it's not going to be a long game)			"

												A heartwarming, or sometimes, gut wrenching tale of the lifes and times of a monster. The kind of monster that monster is can vary entirely dependent on what you do and how you do it, it could be a great big baby eating ogre, a sly trickster, a slithering horror that subtly changes the world behind the scenes, a big though kind hearted beast or even a secretive doctor. It's a feel good game that feels good, and really I think is best served if you just dive into the whimsical tale without any expectations or achivement hunting or anything else, just letting the little fuzzy tale wash over you like a storybook from when you where a child.

												I thought i'd leave a review for this since i just completed it,[THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN GAME SPOILERS] Monster Loves You!{MLY! for short} is a cute but slightly short build your own story and adventure type of game, it's quite fun and the replayability is at least three to four since there are so many options!The options vary and change for every new game, though i will admit getting achievements was more grinding through the game over and over and did get tiring after a while. A good thing about the game is its varied endings, there are the endings in which you choose to dissolve{though i'm afraid that once you've dissolved once the others are practically the same thing for the other traits} and endings where you ascend to elder status - these are actually a little different every time.The other sneaky options and secret endings were quite fun to try and figure out though, the neurosurgeon one was pretty cool.Tl;DR - MLY! Is a cute adventure story game and it has varied endings to go for, it has a repeatability factor too and the choices are randomly generated which changes things up a bit, overall a good game if you like that type of thing.

												I've spent a long time trying to decided how best to review this game, but it all comes down to this: it's cute, not fantastic, but cute. The cartoons are sweet, its silly but not so much so that you roll your eyes through it, and the first run or two was pretty fun... but also pretty short. And not too replayable. After two run-throughs, I'll probably never open this game again. The music, art, and story are all charming, but not very substantial. If you see this game on sale, and you're already into this genre of game, then sure, buy it. Or if you're looking for a fun game for your kids it's a good choice. But if you're just casually looking for something, I don't know that I would recommend this game at full price.			"

												This game has had a LOT of effort put into it. You basically create your own story about how you live and die. There's many different endings, the games rather repetitive the more you play it, but that's really only if you try to do the same thing (which is kinda pointless).

Monster Loves You is a ""choose your own adventure"" version of the entire life cycle of a monster, from spawn to death or glory.  The game poses many situations you must choose from a list of options to solve, each of which usually change one or more of your stats such as bravery, cleverness, or honesty.  You also have an ongoing respect stat that affects how your monsterkind treat you and how likely they are to follow under your leadership.  As a monster you undergo many phases of life all culminating with a large conflictual theme in the end that you must resolve. Choose your own adventure, monster-style.			"

												Very cute game, it doesn't have a good replayability cause you have the same dialogue often so it can be boring once you finish the game 3 or 4 times. Overall it's a fun little game ! And cruel sometime !			"

												Its a funny choice based time waster. It can be as quick as 20 minutes or as long as an hour if you're really in a moral pickle. Most of it will make you laugh. Some of it will make you sit there and think about it for a minute.			"

												I highly recommend playing this game with your children, significant other and family because it will be a different experience every time!This is a monster creation game that is best done with someone else or would be a great game to do on Twitch. It's a 9.5/10 because I wish it had more content or DLC. :)			"

												the game is very short about 1 hour to 30 minutes of gameplay per run. But I found the game is best played at the end of the day, it's crazy how story changes according to your choices. I would recommend this game but not at $10 a way for steam sale to pick it up.			"

												Pretty fun game where your decisions actually matter. At first, I thought this game was not for me, but after playing for a few minutes I found the story and scenarios to be pretty funny! I did not finish all of the endings yet, but I quite enjoyed it. Bought it in a Humble Bundle so for me, definitely worth the money.			"

												Super cute game. Not very long, but a good length. There are so many different endings, it's awesome. Your choices from baby to elder affect the entire game. Super fun.			"

												A cute little all ages game with some real charming aesthetic and worldbuilding.  Mechanically it's a bit shallow, but it's still enjoyed it a lot.  It's definitely a game I could see being a really enjoyable game for children.			"

												5/10I have very mixed feelings about this game. I liked the idea, chilled and had fun while playing BUT the gameplay is only 40 minutes long with 0 replay value. I mean, you can replay the game for the sake of getting different ending (achievements), but basically you'll be facing exact same choices all over again and giving a different answer each time.

												This is a cute little game. The replay value is somewhat limited since the storyline is pretty short, but it's entertaining for two or three playthroughs.			"

												The trailer makes the game look amazing and... it is. It really is. However, not for a fifteen year old like me. It is a family friendly game with positive music and a fun story line. Don't think that this is a hateful review because it really is good and I can picture a younger child playing this with his parents. If you think about it, this game introduces certain concepts and ideas that someone may actually pick up in their personality, like kindness. Overall, it is good... Just not for me.			"

												I saw this game on an episode of Steam Train, and bought it as soon as I was able. There's just something comforting and hilarious about it, even though i always get the same ending! It's simple and straightforward, yet you never really feel like you don't have control over what happens. I've been playing it every once in a while for well over a year now, and still like it.			"

												This game is cute and sweet like others have said, and it's one of the few games my girlfriend enjoys playing with me so that's a plus.I first torrented this game to see if it was any good and after a few playthroughs I had to give these developers their due. I really love The Yawhg and this is a really similar play style. I wish there were more games that had presentation like MLY because it's much more immersive than other visual novel type games that I've played.It's true there aren't a ton of different endings but honestly I've put about 5 hours total into this game and if you buy it on sale then $6~ is definitely a good exchange.

												9/10 This game is cute and fun. I'm so glad I stumbled upon it. I would recommend buying it on sale, just because it is a shorter game, but it's well worth half it's normal price. There are multiple outcomes and the music and atmosphere make for a fun, enjoyable game to play. There isn't an ESRB rating, so I like to provide ones that are as close as possible to the rating system as I can make it. This game hovers between an E10 and a Teen. Normally, I would say E10 for Fantasy Violence, but some of the scenarios in the game are Teen oriented (for example, a monster has the choice to leave a young child and baby to supposedly perish in a burning building, and a few other such scenarios). Everything else is very lighthearted- there are just a few more mature elements for younger players.			"
