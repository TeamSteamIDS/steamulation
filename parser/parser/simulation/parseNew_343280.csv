												This is a very fun space shooter with nice visuals and good music as well. Once I figured out the map, upgrading my ship, and the missions it started going really well. There is a bit of a grind getting all the missions done, but still very fun. I find the leaderboards good, but I always seem to be in 5th place no matter what, even if I 100% it. But its fun to try and 100% every fight. Overall a really fun arcade space shooter.			"

												I had my eye on this game for a while, as I was making a similar game to Zotrix a while ago. The idea of a simple shoot 'em up with a more modular ship appealed to me, and I finally grabbed it.In a way, I had a lot of fun with it, as I was just looking for a mindless game. Shooting stuff is fun!Unfortunately, the pacing, progression and difficulty curve are all completely off. I don't know how the game was in Early Access for 4 months and these glaring issues haven't been dealt with...It's a basic modular shoot 'em up, with levels being composed of several preset waves. The waves are fairly well done, it was fun to play, for a while.The first problem happened right at the beginning. So, the game has several different space stations that you need to go to to complete quests and buy equipment. The paths have different levels of difficulty, which is good. However, the beginning of the game is really bad!Instead of introducing the shop and resource mechanics, you go for a 2-3 missions without being able to buy anything worthwhile. On the third mission, it's also incredibly hard to get to the end without buying anything. I restarted the game 3 or 4 times before I managed to buy the one! right item to beat the level. Where was the problem?In part, it was in how the game explains its upgrades. Items are divided into ""permanent"" and ""expendable"" upgrades. It seemed clear that expendable would be consumables, while permanent would be... well, permanent. That's not quite the case... Shields and Drones, for examples, are listed as expendable, but they actually carry over from mission to mission! The only ""expendable"" feature is that, for a given level, they can be destroyed and do not replenish until you finish that level. From their description, I assumed shields were just a consumable that would be activated for 20 seconds, or so. Turns out, they were actually all I needed to beat the mission.That's not all, though. The first, cheaper shields, are useless. They get destroyed by bullets too easily, rendering them useless. The higher level shields, on the other hand, are basically indestructible by bullets. The only way of destroying them, is by having ships ramming into you. Several in a row.Well, ok... just a minor misunderstanding.The bigger problem is: the higher level shields are really cheap! I bought the second highest on the third mission, and a couple of missions later I had the best. I was almost invincible. The only tough mission was the third. And that's because the game didn't communicate as it should have...Anyway, fast forward a bit, after a few mindless levels, I started looking at the resource trading and more expensive upgrades. In each level you gain some resources and credits. The resources you get are almost laughable, not really of any use. The credits are fine.The thing is, the economy is extremely basic. Assuming you're following the missions, you see what the next station is, and the game tells you which resources are higher. Then, you buy all the resources available to you, and sell on the next station. After a few levels, you have all the money you want.The game has 40 missions (each consisting of more than 2 levels, generally). Before the 15th mission, my ship was fully upgraded. I had virtually infinite money as resources. Only I had 25 missions left. At this point... what's the point?The story isn't particularly good, as the actual missions are simply ""Go from here, to here, to there"" because of a random excuse. There is no consequence or choice at all. It reminds me of a Clicker game, in some ways. Or an MMO, with the power creep thing. You just go around the places getting more powerful. The level don't keep up at all.I was steam rolling the game... With no purpose at all.The game has secondary weapons, like missiles or bombs. But you buy these individually. And if you use a missile, it's gone. Moreover, they're far, far weaker than your main weapon! It's useless. The drones are also a nice idea, but pointless is execution. They shoot automatically, but, again, they're very weak, and they also miss a lot.The levels are very basic too, as you leave exactly as you got in. There are ""upgrades"" in each level, as you start with a single shot, but can collect double and triple shot for that level. It's very linear, though, and you'll also get both upgrades at the same points. ...Oh well. There are other minor annoyances (and the music is simply there, tracks playing without a point) and some of the sound-effects overpowering everything else and being annoying.I was very negative in this review... Which doesn't really reflect my experience!I enjoyed the game a lot, as it was exactly what I was looking to play at the time. Something mindless and simple. It was cool!But the game itself, objectively speaking, has some very critical problems that make me not recommend it. I enjoyed my time, but I stopped playing after mission 18 because the game didn't keep up with the player. That's a huge  problem.If you think you'll enjoy it anyway, give it a go, the shooting can be fun! :)			"

Early Access Review
								***Written using a key provided by the Developer for review purposes***Zotrix is an arcade, space shooter that is inspired by arcade games from the 80's and 90's that has just launched on Early Access. In Zotrix you assume the role of a captain tasked with escorting different cargo ships to what remains of the human race all living in different space stations. Completing missions grants you rewards in the form of credits and materials, credits (and sometimes materials) are used to purchase upgrades and materials can be bought and sold to earn more credits. I've never played a game like this before and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.+Nice retro graphics and everything is designed well+Great soundtrack+Simple controls which your ship responds to very well+Projectiles can be shot and destroyed as well as the ships firing them+A wide range of upgrades can be purchased for your ship+Simple yet very addictive gameplay+There are already 40 missions and more will be added when the game releases+Good variation of mission length+You get powerups in the missions which make your weapons stronger+Quite a lot of different enemy ship types+It's nice that you can make money from trading as well as completing missions+/-The only replay value (once you've completed all 50 missions which will take you a while) comes from replaying missions you've already done to get a higher score-The missions feel pretty similar to each other-The asteroid texture looks out of place to me -Quite a few grammatical errors in the game and on the store pageVerdict:7A good arcade space shooter with addictive gameplay, I'm looking forward to see how it develops through its Early Access stage.El K.

												Zotrix:~~~~~~ Zotrix is a retro arcade shoot’em up with a twist of strategy. At the start of the game you will be at your mission control. There, you’ll have options to upgrade your vessel, go to the trade resources, see your current position by using the map or you can start a mission.Essentially, you have to go to another space station with a specific cargo. Upon success of your mission, you will be rewarded with space credits and resources too (Gold, Nickel and others).  With credits, not only you will be able to buy resources to go towards upgrading your vessels (weapons and other gizmos) but you can also assess which destination (space station) is buying resources at a higher price that you bought it so you can make a profit. During mission you can move your spacecraft all around the screen which takes a little time to master but if you are used to this type of arcade game you will have no problem whatsoever.Nice retro graphics and really good soundtracks.To be honest, this game is surprisingly good for an early access game.  Positives: ~~~~~~~ -	Good Retro Graphics-	Lots of upgrades-	Trade Resource Room-	Fun, Fast and Addictive-	Great soundtracks-	Trading cardsNegatives:~~~~~~~~   -	A bit repetitive (mission)All I can say is bring on the full version ASAP!MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HEREFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE "

												This game is pretty good. Frustrating? Yes. Difficult. YES. In space? YES!The only thing I don't understand is the optimization of the particle effects. My CPU and GPU (i5 and the highest radeon series) are equipped to handle that stuff, yet I get severe lag when too many particles are on the screen, with a density of 20 parts/cm^2 or greater. I know, one can turn the particles down, or even off, but I don't need to. My computer can handle what the game is doing, but for some reason the game is way, way too taxing in terms of particle effects.One UI thing that bothered me was the fact that you can go to the resource trade menu from the equipment store menu, but not the other way around. It's nit-picky, but that's what critiques are about. The graphics are amazing, so I have no issues there.The music is one of my favorite parts of this game. I would list the artists here, but there is a metric ton of people behind the music design, relative to how small the game is. There are also sound bars that are present in the main menu and the starting screen. Each level begins with a (usually) different-than-the-last-one-heard soundtrack, with the title of said soundtrack appearing on the screen. Obviously this game had a big focus on sound quality.The gameplay is pretty much what this genre is all about; you fly a colorful collection of pixels around a black and white background, shooting squares at other collections of squares as they shoot squares back at you. The game features newtonian mechanics. For example, there is a pushback effect from shooting, which is actually pretty unique in 2D space shooters. The ship, however, just kind of stops. This is counter-intuitive, unless the ship has some kind of RCS that the player can't see, which is what I'm guessing.The innovation here is that it's a 2D space shooter with resource trading and upgrading. It's not a roguelike, like FTL. It isn't as huge and encouraging of exploration as in EVE online. It also isn't just some boring Galaga clone. It's some hybrid of those games.If you want to play a casual space shooter and feel an actual feeling of accomplishment after beating a level without ejecting out of your ship, play this.			"

								It's trully a blast to the past. Zotrix is reminiscent of the finest golden-era shooters that us veterans played in 80's :) Though the basic premise of 'shoot everything in your sight' is still the same, it works suprisingly well on many levels, succesfully incorporating trading mechanics as well as some basic economics. Seeing this as a first game of this genre from this young Croatian studio, I can only look forward to future updates and refinements!			"

												The current state of the game does not support Xbox controllers well. For strange reasons the game requires a lengthy gamepad calibration the first time you activate the Xbox controller in game. The calibration stage is cumbersome yet producing bad calibration results, and it is impossible to steer and aim in the game in any meaningful way.Bad impression regarding the gamepad controls, as I have yet to see a gamepad compatible game on steam that requires calibrations. Most games just work with gamepad right off the bat.Maybe the developer try to ensure precise aiming, by mapping the range of the twin sticks to the corners of the screen of the current frame size? Anyway, stay away from using gamepad for the moment before a fix is available.However, the graphics and sounds in game is pretty superb, albeit the in game dialogues can not be fast forwarded/skipped. If you do do that, please make an effort to make the dialogue brief, relevant, and interesting.			"

								You could have told me that this was a port of an actual arcade hit from the period, and I'd have believed you.Zotrix has fast response, interesting enemy wave patterns, a killer soundtrack, and a good working upgrade system. The only letdown is the graphics department, but in a game like this you focus more on surviving than on how shiny everything is anyway!The game is still in early access, but is fully playable and looks to me to be really complete as is.Zotrix is simply fun to play.

Early Access Review
								Early Access Review as of 4/13/2015 Game Detail Name: ZotrixDev: Zerobit Game [Friendly Chaps]Genre: Arcade Shooter, Economic Management, Bullet Hell What is Zotrix? Along comes a game, a game that bravely claims that it follows the olden ways of playstyle  that of the arcade shooter genre. Now we question this little game, we belittle and ask it, ""Are you really what you claim to be?"" And that little game rear its Early Access head and said. ""Yes""And that my good man and woman of steam and of the internet is what Zotrix claim and manages to land for. An arcade shooter game with elements of modern day gaming mechanic instead of sticking to retro style graphics alone to earn free nostalgia point. It's uhh... fun. In a rather brutal and uncompromising way. Gameplay I wish I was joking but in this game of arcade shooter it actually has elements of trading and resource management. To give a little insights we human have basically conquer the world and made colonies on mars when suddenly *poof* aliens came and destroy us. So you, another faceless grunt who ate the propaganda the world leader told you must now defend the colonies and cargo ships from further incursion. For mankind!You start with a peashooter and a weak ship then you must choose a mission, look longingly at the upgrades and then shoot all the enemies that come in your screen and not die! Basically thats it but the added gameplay elements made for a more different experience than the rest, for example powerups are limited only to upgrade your main gun but you can add other side weapons, drones and shields to your ships so it can take on the bigger foes that plague the later missions. Speaking of which missions have difficulty number with higher being more difficult and adding more varied enemy type. Your peashooter cant last long without upgrades and Zotrix allow you to do just that with the money and materials you have earned! The inventory of each station is randomized when you arrived so some important upgrades like shields might not be available. Speaking of which you also get material needed to actually make those upgrade. I suppose you're not really buying them but rather employing the people on the station to make those upgrades. Make sense.Eventually you start getting harder and harder missions but i manage to finish a level 10 threat mission with nothing more than my peashooter craft and a pair of very powerful side arm so that counts.You can also nullify shots by shooting at it as it comes or if you're about to crash, pressing space ducks you into 3d space for a few moment so you can avoid all those 2d shots from the other spaceships. Sound Good, good. Lots of custom track in the game and most of them are techno beat which i like, hopefully the dev release the soundtrack. A minor complain is while the sound effects and music are awesome the difference a level 2 shot makes and a level 3 shot make is rather jarring at the moment. Graphics Nice retro graphics there, background is a clear contrast color along with the shots thus making it easy to see which is a common issue in a shoot em up game. Graphics for the rest of the game is is functional and does not detract from the overall experience. All in all good. Conclusion The little game was beaten with its face on the ground so i reach up and said. ""Fine, you're good."" And that is what i say to Zotrix. A fun little game that does what it claims to do with good execution. Scoring Methology [Courtesy of Meat King]:-	S-Rank: excellent-	A-Rank: very good-	B-Rank: solid-	C-Rank: satisfactory-	D-Rank: inferiorVerdict for early access review of Zotrix: A-Rank Early Access Hiccups? Non so far, it was bug free and i daresay I am merely Beta testing it instead of Alpha testing which is a good thing. The dev was a friendly chap and he did allude to me a few more unimplemented features. Might go back to reavaluate later. Check out the Original Network Groups.

												On paper, this would be one of my favorite games. I love top-down arcade shooters, and resource trading/management, and upgrade loops. Zotrix has all of these things, and it does them all in a very mediocre way.The shooting, where you'll spend most of your time, is incredibly boring and easy. Enemies will slowly march onto the screen, single file, where you will immediately wipe them all out by firing in a straight line - even without any upgrades. As the game grows in difficulty (at a glacier pace), occasionally two lines of enemies will come out simultaneously, which means you might miss a few, so you'll get fewer credits at the end of the level. You're never really in danger, and you easily become disinterested. This is not how you should feel when you're alone in space against thousands of aliens. Resource trading is also devoid of complexity or meaningful choices. Different stations sell different resources at different prices - but you can preview the price of any resource of every station before making the trip, meaning that there is no decision making, no research, and no risk at all. You can expect a small (5-10%) profit every single time you make a jump. This adds absolutely nothing to the game.Upgrades are weird and usually trivial. It's hard to know what things do or why you'd need them. Nothing that I found changes the game at all; it's simply bigger numbers (more damage to a primary blaster cannon, etc).On top of all this, you'll find numerous quality-of-life annoyances throughout the entire game. There's no Sell All button in the resource trading, so you have to type in all the numbers by hand (also, no numpad support). Sound effects for shooting are obnoxiously loud, completely obscuring the music. English is likely not the developer's first language - you'll see numerous grammatical oddities. Et cetera. Zotrix is an unpolished, uninteresting game that does not even come close to its potential. Avoid.			"

								Note: Sorry for my bad English, still learning it.Zotrix is an arcade shoot 'em up where you can move around freely in ANY directions possible and shoot baddies which there are various types of them. It has simple but tight controls, fun and addictive gameplay, smooth animation and simple yet beautiful graphics. The trading mechanic is suprisingly well done! You can make money or buy supplies in order to upgrade your ship off from trading. The soundtrack is one of the best 80s-ish music I have ever heard! You can find it through the game folders too! I'm looking forward to buying the soundtrack for this game and some improvements to the game shown below:-Add resolution options -Let us know the mission's difficulty -The missions feels kinda repetitive, although I find it getting harder as the game progressesDespite all that, this is a must have for shoot 'em ups veterans back in the day and for beginners as well. I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops through its Early Access stage.UPDATE#1: Kudos to the devs for listening to the feedback, indications of missions' difficulties have been added! Great job! :DUPDATE#2 Since forever: Sorry guys, haven't played the game for e'ons because of CS:GO :P                                      Anyway, the game looks more improved way more than I had in mind,                 Great job, Zotrix Devs!

Early Access Review
Overall rating: 8 / 10Zotrix is a space shooter coming from an experienced Indie game development team - ZeroBit Games. Zotrix is also their first game published on steam platform.Whilst, as any early access game there is a lot of room for improvement the game runs rather smooth and promises quite a lot. I've had the privilege of discussing the game with its developers and the impression gained is quite positive. Aside the fact of ZeroBit's constant feedback collection and the friendly nature of its developers there is also no lack of ideas and possible twists the game could take.--------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics: 8 / 10The game runs smoothly, which is really important for the type of games that is Zotrix. It is pleasing to the eye and with the adjustable amount of particles you may choose whatever you are most comfortable with.Sounds: 7.5 / 10Suitable music throughout the stages. I feel as if the music volume is a bit too low and SFX a bit too high by default, but you can adjust them to how you feel works the best and from there to enjoy the experience that it builds up.Gameplay: 8.5 / 10At the current stage, players can select from an alright variety of upgrades for the ship which are not permanent. Every upgrade bought can be lost with the destruction of your ship and will have to be re-purchased. The story itself is currently not too big, but I can positively say that the possibilities of further development are endless and the game might become much bigger than it currently is depending from the path developers continue guiding the game to.There is currently a very interesting mechanic in the game that allows you to go ""in the background"" by pressing space and thus avoid enemy bullets easily. Whilst I try to play without using this function, it is very good in case you cannot beat a level and in that way it provides an easy way out of a sticky situation in case you decide you need it. There are also small instructions currently implemented in the game that you may access by pressing f1 during the mission.Fun factor: 8 / 10Recommended!			"

Product received for free
Gameplay is okay, but after playing 5th level I felt I'm doing the same.I dislike shooting sounds - if you don't really make them down in options (accessible only from Main Menu!) it will totally overwhelm music - which is good, but not fitting feeling of this game properly... it's just playing - no ""changes"" to music when new wave appears or any thing.* Storyline seems ok, but I don't feel it really :(* The trading and upgrade windows looks very ugly :( * You always finish mission on 5th spot in leaderboards? That's fishy...Generally, I liked space-shooter games in past (XOP is one of my favourite titles), but since Steam times I didn't found any good. I got game for free, but I try to rate it as product for full price - at this price it's really shocking me :(PS: I feel ashamed not recommending this game, because as indie product it's quite good... comparing to other games I got for free, but I wouldn't really tell my friend ""hey, look, that's game that's worth playing"" about this game :(edit: I almost forgot... when you try to type numbers (for example of items you want to buy [resources amount, I mean]) numpad keys are not working... (yes, numlock is on).			"

												This game looks good at first, and I like what it tries to do, but it needs alot of polish. The missions have you grinding through levels you've already done. The resource trading system allows you to get the best equipment not even halfway through the game, making the aforementioned grinding even easier and more boring once you get past the initial difficulty curve. It really needs an autofire feature. There are lots of strange interface quirks that weren't ironed out.The music is cool at lest.			"

								Brilliant! I highly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates retro-like games. In gameplay I would give it an 8/10. I rate this an 8/10 because the gameplay is great but nothing completely special. It is challenging though. On the graphics I give it a 10/10. This game obviously wasn't going for beautiful graphics but the game lives up to what it was aimed for. I would rate the complexity of the game 9/10. The game is very complex and I love how you have to stop and logically think things out. I do have to complain that the resources are easily manipulated. If you study what the sells are you can easily get unlimited credits. If that's how it ment to be then I will learn to adjust to the easyily-acquired credits. Overall rating is a whopping 9/10. Looking forward to playing more.			"

												I love this game. It could be because I have an extreme bias for this genre, or any game that reminds me of a misspent (debatable) youth in Arcade/Pizza joints when the quarter was king. I don't think it's just that, though. Zotrix is an excellent retro top-down shooter in it's own right, but it is boosted to even greater heights by the more modern RPG elements woven in. The action is pretty fast-paced, but never seems to skew too far out of reach in it's difficult moments, even as you level up. It stays challenging, but never frustrating to the point of rage-quit. It has a pretty great soundtrack as well, and all the great pew-pew laser sounds you would expect from a title of this sort. If you're looking for a good time, a trip down memory lane, a compelling little twist an a familiar genre, or all of the above, then this is definitely the game for you. Just play it already, but remember....I got next.			"

								If you like retro games with a screen full of enemies and bullets this is the game for you.  It has everything you’d want in a game like this.  Enemies… and I’d say lots of of them but that would be an understatement as it feels like Galaga meets Asteroids on steroids.  Oh yes, I mentioned the bullets.. If you’re slow to react to a new wave coming from the other side of the screen expect a screen full of bullets intent on blowing your ship to pieces.  Thankfully you do have a shield and it’s not instant death which is a good thing as for me I’d probably only be playing for seconds rather than minutes.  It has a very nice feel and some decent power ups you can pick up along your journey if you can master the inertia on your ship as sometimes you can over shoot and just miss it by millimetres.  If you’re a competent player you can buy upgrades for your ship and increase your firepower and even test your new ship configuration before you make a purchase. :) I’m looking forward to dual stick support and I’m hoping for an “Easier” option to help new less experienced players progress through the game. :)  I fully recommend this game to anyone that wants a fast paced arcade challenge.

												This game has serious balancing issues. It is very easy to get overpowered gear very early in the game. This makes completing the game tedious and boring. The trading aspect of the game can be completely ignored. After finishing the first 10 to 15 missions there is not much more to upgrade and you'll basically have an endless supply of resources and money. Some of the upgrade items (the different missiles i.e.) and all the lower tier gear is completely obsolete. The story doesn't matter at all. It's just escort mission after escort mission. The enemy types and attack patterns repeat over and over again. When you are in the upgrade shop it is not possible to directly compare the items in the shop to the ones you have already installed. There are also still a few bugs in the game. Often when the last wave of a level is finished it takes one or two minutes of flying through empty space until the level finally ends. The basic idea of the game is very cool. It makes me sad to see so much wasted potential. This could easily be a really fun game if the developers fix the balancing, add some variety and give the player a reason to use trading. In the current state it's just a textbook example of game design gone wrong.			"

												A twin-stick vertical shooter-- what a novel idea! Unfortunately it is wasted on the most boring, repetitive arcade game ever made. While I like the intuitive concept of non-linear mission selection, equipment stores and resource trading, any pilot worth his salt will have enough to purchase the best ship, and the best equipment, after just a few missions, rendering the entire in-game economy completely worthless. Once you buy the best shield, you never lose it-- even if it is fried during battle it will be back again for your next flight. The game's array of drones, bombs and missiles are totally superfluous, except to hasten the destruction of enemy waves, since nearly everything is destructible in seconds with the standard blaster. If you destroy enemies too quickly, you effectively throw off the game's scripting and have to twiddle your thumbs for upwards of a MINUTE until the mission catches up and starts throwing enemies at you again. GOD.Speaking of missions, there are 40 story-based ""levels"" in all, but they are all the same. You just battle the same dozen enemies in the same dozen attack patterns against the same boring starscape backdrop over, and over, and over, and over again, with the occasional invincible boss encounter, until you ""beat"" the game. The story is boring and involves nothing more than political espionage; the true motives of the titular Zotrix that you mass-murder throughout is never extrapolated upon. it never rises above title-card after title-card of he did this, she said that, go here, now go there. Nothing INTERESTING happens.This game took me 30 hours to beat over three months because I could only handle one or two missions at a time before succumbing to sheer bordom. Half of that time was spent completing more tedious ""side"" missions to access story-oriented routes. The game justifies these detours through your accrument of resources, which, as I already mentioned, are useless after the first half hour. There is little challenge to combat once you learn to master ""diving"" to avoid collisions. Every level trickle-feeds you the same two weapon-upgrades, and nothing else.I hate to rag on Zotrix because it is technically sound and feels like the outline of a much better game... unfortunately, it is not that game nor will it ever be.

You progress through a campaign where you'll need to consider your build out for the enemy you'll face.  Recommended.			"

			COMPETITION ENDED! Massive thanks to the Developer for the review copy! I take a quick look @ 'Zotrix' Zotrix is an arcade space shooter inspired by early shooter games on arcade machines from 80's...		

Zotrix is an arcade space shooter inspired by early shooter games on arcade machines from 80's and early 90's. Designed for all generations it contains missions with nice and colorful enemies while focused on the arcade element of the gameplay. You dive into deep space escorting a cargo ship from your fleet. Quickly you realize you're within the boundaries of enemy territory. Chains of enemy ships are lining up one by one while you perform maneuvers to clear the perimeter and avoid being cleared out yourself. Victory doesn't come easy as you have to earn every single space credit out there fighting in over 50 missions.			"

Early Access Review
								I voted for this game on Greenlight and I bought a copy as soon as it became available for Linux and it doesn't disappoint.  Overall, it's a very fun game.  It's a retro style bullet hell arcade twin stick shooter with really catchy music.  The game play is fun and addicting.  The levels aren't long, but there appear to be plenty of them.  You can choose which route you take, which alters which levels you do and adds to the replay value.  At present, there are plenty of levels to choose from and there will be even more once the game gets a full release.  The game has beautifully colorful 2D classic arcade top-down graphics.  It also has really low system requirements.  The game even runs at full speed on my 1 GHz dual core laptop with 3GB RAM and AMD HD6290 graphics. So, it can probably run on most anything.There are only a couple minor issues right now, but its Eary Access and you have to expect these things.  One issue is that the Upgrades feature doesn't work in Linux.  Pushing that on either my laptop or my gaming desktop causes the game to crash.  This makes the game considerably more difficult as the levels progress and the enemies become tougher.  The second issue is that the controller support is a bit lacking.  The left (movement) stick is fine, but the right (aiming) stick has limited range and stays on the left side of the screen, making it about impossible to switch directions of fire.  But, that's not a deal breaker as the keyboard and mouse controls work fine.  Plus, the dev team on this game seems really friendly and they're active on the discussions boards.  They're actively seeking feedback and looking for problems, so I expect they'll have these problems ironed out before too long.  Once they do, the game will be perfect.			"

												All in all, it feels too repetitive and bland.The music is great, although each level consists of aiming at ships that appear from the edges of the screen. The story is progressed mainly by following different routes from starbase to starbase. As far as I could tell, there was no feedback as to exactly how long was in each route. As such, it made each map--especially the earlier routes--drone on, and on, and on. The backgrounds are all black with stars as the cargo ship you're 'protecting' moves from the bottom of the screen to somewhere in the middle of the screen.For upgrades, you buy resources and collect money through the various routes and space stations, which all offer their own slightly-unique selection of goods. They're nothing special: shields, added blasters, missiles/bombs, but adds just a little bit of customizability to an otherwise uninspired game.All in all, the game would benefit from a form of timer or distance bar, as well as having more variety during routes/missions. But, as I see it, the game is too bland to recommend for sh'mup fans.			"

												fun for a few.  uninspired, repetitve gameplay with quests that are unrewarding and basically pointless.   has some odd bugs such as quests being given out of order and completing themselves and occasional frame rate drop issues when a ""boss"" type appears on the screen.  upgrades feel weightless and thus continued playing and/ or grinding becomes quickly tedious. I recommend looking for another twin stick shooter, but if you really want to buy it.. buy it only for a few bucks at most.			"

Early Access Review
								Disclosure I recieved a review copy of this game and the dev asked me to do a little writeup about this ;3I will change this in the future as the game progresses and I invest more time into it.This is a fun space shooter similar to the old games I used to play in pizza shops as a kid.  The shop system in the game is unique, you buy/sell resources with different prices in different regions and are required to use specific resources when you buy upgrades.  Overall this is nice and determines what mission you will attempt to do based on reasource prices at the destination.  The actual gameplay is solid but basic,  I really do hope they add more depth to the way enemies spawn.  The on rails movement of enemies is fine but doing it for every enemy makes the game feel alittle dull in my opinion.  I havn't played long enough to comment on the weapon progression but right now it appears that all the upgrades you recieve are temporary/powerups that last only in the stage you recieve them.			"

												The difficulty varies wildly from level to level and the combat is tedious at best.  Staying in the bottom corner and shooting diagonally is a legitimate strategy that carries you through a lot more levels than it should.  I like the concept, but the execution would need a lot more work to make this game fun.			"

												Very little content, very unpolished, a lot of bugs (including FPS drops, freezing and crashing). Also extremely repetitive - after two hours you will know all enemies, maps, waves, patterns etc. Bugs in main storyline prevent completing the game.I have seen better arcade games for free on Kongregate.

												The concept so far is great, however, there is no real progression.  You go from a relatively easy difficulty to enemies that take multiple hits from your stock weapons in order to kill them.  So far, I have yet to discover how to earn enough credits on one or two missions to enhance my survivability on the third mission.  Game definitely has balance issues, I don't recommend it until the devs get those issues worked out.  Looks like another early access game took me for a ride.			"

												It was like drug wars with really slow, clunky, boring space shooter sequences that last for ~7 minutes between every travel.  Ship customization isn't very in depth.Worst of all, the game starts with a 5 minute unskippable ""cutscene"" that is just a planet doing nothing, and a single line of text appearing one letter at a time.

												The text was very slow and couldn't be sped up or skipped. Everything looked very complex in the very beginning and made me want to avoid it all. Controller didn't work right. You could probably play with it but things like "" press the ""A"" button to continue but it was actually left on the dpad"" would make it very difficult to figure out.			"

												Sort of recommend, but not quite. Definitely get it on sale if you do. Interesting little shooter with a nice retro feeling.However, the balance is all over the place, most levels are incredibly boring, then you suddenly get a screen full of unkillable enemies, bullets flying everywhere. You initally can't take many hits, until you get the last 2 shields and then you can LITERALLY take ALL the bullets to the face. Quests feel meaningless, there are essentially only 1 type of weapon you can buy, and there's like 4 of them. Had about 1-2 hours of okay fun with it, but I ended up giving up before I finished it simply because there wasn't anything remotely interesting to do anymore.			"
