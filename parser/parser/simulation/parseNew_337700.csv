												Ok lad so i've completed the game and here is what i can say.The game is good.I really enjoyed the gameplay especially the zero g touch that was cool.Its a hardcore survival game so yeah its dark and once you start its hard but youll get the hang of it .Of course it has its down sides like for example you move a little slowly in the zero G or maybe i didnt figure out how to befaster i'm not sure about that there are some really minor bugs that i think will be patched so in the end.The game is a hardcore depressing survival with a interessting gameplay its a bit hard but im tired of games acting as if im a toddler so if you consider yourself a real gamer want to get home and play something dark aloneand enjoy yourself a challenge i say the game is worth it 9/10			"

												I just jumped in to check it out. Here is what I have to say to those who said "" Why did I buy it?""***This is not a game for CASUALS******I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A GAME FOR CASUALS.***Just like some other guy said this is Space Dark Souls. No hand holding no bottle feeding. This has the most accurate simulation of Zero-G Physics I've ever seen. You actually float and hit the wall and respond accordingly, my brain feels good.  I will update as I spend some time in the game for now just wanted to clarify that you shoudn't waste your hard earned 6$ in this game if your expecting something easy. Or you know...just use EZ Mode. Filthy casuals.			"

												This is one of the most hardcore expericenses I have ever played. It just drops you in BAM! What has happened in this place? Everyone is gone. I explore for an hour and find the ""Construction"" level. Dark and unfriendly place full of loot ? I explore more and find a way jurry rig all the lights on. Now I can proceed but two aliens kill me.I start again. I look more thorowly in Filter Room 1 and notice a  vent that I can open with an old crowbar I found. I am in outer space now. In the small window before the sun sets I managed to light some projectors and now I can navigate the darkness.So if you like to discover things on your own there is a lot to discover here. My first playthrough had me solving the training puzzles in linear fashion. My second playtrough had me exploring the outside of the  asteroid in an open world style. This game has a lot to offer if you put the time in to figure things out.			"

												It's a great podcast game. It is not easy, but I find it relaxing. Sometimes it can get a little slow when I can't figure a puzzle out, but listening to your fav show while repairing  something in space really makes you feel like you are an engineer in his element.			"

												This game remids me a lot of the Treasure Hunter mission in Red Dead Redemption. You are given a picture and description and you have to  find a thing. It is more enoyable if you take it in small steps. When it starts to feel to demanding it is better to stop, chill and continue another time. I like it since the is a lot to do for 7$.			"

												This game is so interesting... I played it before it's release as beta and now its even better. Survival, puzzle, mystery, indie, horror are some of the elements u find in it. The storyline is taking place in space where you have to find your way out by solving puzzles. There are no clues on what to do. Your brain is your only companion and with patience i am sure you will solve it. Zero gravity effect seems real and its hard to control it at the beginning. It's difficult cause you must discover alone what to do and quite challenging to survive untill you run out of oxygen.			"

												I found the game to be difficult and confusing but not in a good way. Other reviews have stated that the game doesn't ""hold your hand"" and that is an understatement. The game tells you almost literally nothing. You get the basic control scheme and that is pretty much it.The interface and HUD are a bit clunky. The first puzzle in the game is... well... starting the game. I clicked on ""play"", selected my difficulty setting which then disapears and then I sat there for 30 seconds waiting for the game to start before figuring out that I have to click ""play"" a 2nd time to get it to go. You are then brought to a small room in zero gravity with some of the controls listed on the wall and a whole mess of numbers in the corner of the screen. One is a clock that is ticking down to something and a few other indicators that I still don't know what they all mean. I figured out that one is a health indicator, not sure about the others. I get that the game is supposed to be hard but some things in a game should be explained, like for example, what the stuff on your HUD is for and what it means. You also start with a note that simply says ""Lab 20"" on it (I assume that is my objective) and perhaps one of the worst flashlights in video game history. The game is very dark and I think the flashlight makes it worse by putting a large white spot on one side of the screen while also failing to actually light anything. You also move very slowly. At first I thought it might be an FPS issue, but moving my head and other moving objects are moving fluidly with no lag soooo I think you just move slowly.There are also these wierd physics puzzles I guess scattered around. You fly into this yellow circular structure in the wall and then you have to bounce around like a billard ball into another circle and it teleports you to another room. You have no free move controls in these puzzles you just aim at the wall and hope that you bounce off it at the right angle to land in the circle. Prepare to do many of them again and again and again and again just to get to the next room. It isn't really ""hard"" it is more like ""frustrating"".The game has potential. The atmosphere of the game is good and the graphics are very nice for an indy title. It just needs a little bit of polish. I think a little backstory and some more indepth instructions besides ""press ? for controls"" and welcome to a defunct space station, now go find lab 20 - would be a big improvement. The developer seems like he is making constant improvements based on feedback and that is always a good thing.I have a hard time recomending this game. If you do decide to play it I recomend setting aside a few hours and a pen and paper (seems to be one of those kinds of games...) to make maps and notes. I might give the game a 2nd chance later when I can do just that. If that is your cup of tea and you don't mind a bit of inappropriate furstration then give the game a try.  "

												I came back to write this review. I originally was one of the first to play and buy this game.The developer himself bought this game on other accounts just to review and give his own game a thumbs up. *Told his friends too*. This is skewing the review system. Review and more info below.I love being the first one to beat games, especially hard ones. So when I saw that another player beat it before me I was surprised, as I had dedicated 12 straight hours to this game. Then I realized, the player who beat me was the developers friend. I made a video review for the game, suggestions, and solved most of the puzzles. Instead of being straight with me, the developer only said ""the game can be beaten in about 30 minutes"". Following what he said, in this game's original release, to ""unlock"" the ending scene, you were required to get a laundry list of items that required you to fill your inventory 4-5 times with items that were already rare to come by. It was nearly impossible to do in a 30 minute time frame. It has now been fixed after I had to make a video about it. I wasn't given a refund so yeah, if you buy this game, never expect a refund past the 2 hour mark. Which is a real steal considering it takes you about 2 hours to figure out that you're getting nowhere in this space world, it literally is that ridiculous. You will find yourself wondering why you bought this game as it is not difficult in the sense of intelligence, but instead will test your patience. The plot itself is lacking, you wake up as a schizophrenic and are told to get to one place. ""No two playthroughs will be the same""? No matter what, you are doing the same thing, get from point A to point B getting 10 of C, D and 20 of E. Oh you got past that point? Get 20 F. The list goes on. The game is not worth it. The developer is not worth supporting. The developer has changed, his name is in the comments below. midnight640, yeah, you better make your profile private.			"

												I actually don't mind the games lag.  I beat the game and it was quite challenging.  The zero g made it feel more like space.  I reallly had to think when it came to the puzzles.  It actually felt like a horror game even though it doesn't have jumpscares.  The feeling of absolute issolation was there as well as an amazing atmosphere. I really liked it.			"

												Yeah, give this one a shot. - No bugs so far.- The dev seems  to respond and add suggestions. - Great atmosphere and a great simulator of 0GA bit slower on the slowpaced side, (due to backtracking or my inconpetence) but nothing gamebreaking. A quicktravel feature will be much apreciated.PS:It resebles Bioshock Infinite Burial at sea Part 2 in the since that you are locked in an open world, form the first person. that consists of separate levels and you look for parts to repair something.

												No knock on the idea, but the motion system seems terribly difficult to get the hang of, and the lack of atmosphere is saddening - maybe employing a more FPS style camera control as opposed to this strange rotation mechanic. That and amp up the atmosphere! holy crap, I felt like I was wandering the halls of some unfinished horror game.*This comment is based on a 30 min playthrough of the game, and now having 2 (or more depending on who reads this when) hours worth of playtime, the above is not a decent or even resonable review. (For future reference, this review used to be a 'Would not Recommend')			"

												Great little game, if you have the right expectations. The main problem or strenght is that it is slow paced for some this is relaxing for other boring.

												Hard to recommend this game. I understand the idea of self discovery, but there is no gradual introduction of systems or mechanics here, everything is just thrown at you with a giant in game list of commands.Perhaps there is something special underneath the surface here, but it is so buried only the most dedicated need apply.Check out my blind first impressions video below.
