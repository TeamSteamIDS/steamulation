												It's a really enjoyable target shooter. Nice choice of weapons, good handling, great target variety; for a $5 game there is nothing bad about it.If you enjoy target shooting, this is a great game to get. "

												Not a bad arcade target/rail shooter ! The game has pretty ok gfx enuf to get the job done for your eyes and the controls are pretty good and accurate.I think the only thing i would like them to add is a key remaper for us with more buttons on our mice you could map all keys to mouse and just use that :) Hope they mite add this maybe!!A real good game to play for killing time or waiting for other games to download or if you dont have much time and just want something to play that is fast and can be stopped at any point.So if you like this type of game i say give Reload a SHOT!! :P			"

												An overall pretty good shooting range/target practice game that will keep players interested for a while. The controls are responsive. The shooting is fun and satisfying, there is variety in the guns you use, quite a lot of game modes, achievements, medals, bonus items, etc. You get a lot for five dollars. The graphics while not stellar aren't that bad ethier. It's clear the developers wanted to make graphics for the pc verison as neat and cleaned up as possible in comparison to the Wii verison. That little bit of effort is well-apprecited. The only downside I can see for this game is that it probably will have a very limited appeal. Because of the fact that there isn't any actual combat in the game and is mostly target practice and such. If you're playing this game with the mindset that it will be something action-filled like Call of Duty and Battlefeild. Then you're already expecting the wrong things out of this game and will likely walk away dissapointed.  I also like the fact that shooting in this game is portrayed in a little more realistic style. Doing things like shooting on the move is not so easy as it looks.			"

YouTube™ Video: Reload • PC gameplay • 1080p 60FPS • GTX 970 • MAX SETTINGS • SweetFX

			Reload - 60 FPS FullHD (1080p) gameplay walkthrough (last level) • Game running on PC with max settings • Watch in Google Chrome browser for 1080p60fps setting Reload is a realistic weapons and...		

Think of it as an extended tutorial section taken from some kind of FPS game. You get to shoot different targets with variety of weapons, such as pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle or AK-47. You don't move your character - you only aim, shoot, and reload (sometimes you use scope as well). In most missions your time is very limited, so you have to work fast and try not to waste ammo. The game is not too hard though - if you just want to finish it there are only 2-3 missions that can be really challenging. Getting platinum medals in all missions is a different story and a real challenge. Game contains no violence - you only shoot objects such as wooden figures, pumpkins or cans, so kids are safe to play it. Cons? Graphics are a bit dated (but acceptable in this price range) and the game itself is very short - you can easily play through all the levels in under two hours. There are achievements and medals, however, that will keep you occupied for a longer period of time. If you're looking for something casual or need a break from ""serious"" games - Reload should do the trick.			"

												If you're waiting for rescuing hostages, taking down terrorists or simply sniping scarecrows, you will be served with Reload! And watch your step, make sure not to be hit by... paint bullets. Because in Reload, you're shooting at wooden/metal/paper targets. And it's like that at every scenario in your carrier. Anyway, the goal is to score points and to earn medals. Platinum medals are the highest one. By doing the campaign, you'll unlock glasses that will make random targets appear for extra points.  And the more the glasses are upgraded, the highest are the points.You have also some rail shooting actions - these are my favorite.Yet, there are some problems: the shotgun scenario named Quick Target is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥if you want to avoid any civilian casualty. But as I discovered, it's possible to earn the platinum medal with some of them being shot down. The sniping sequences are probably the hardest: given the fact that you're breathing, your crosshair is going crazy, like in Sniper Elite. But you can't zoom more. And when you're reloading, the game is messing the spot you were monitoring: I have my zoom on the grass most of the time. Thanks god, you can let some targets ""alive"" and still score a platinum medal.The graphics are correct, though not so extraordinary, the soundtrack is good, so is the replayability.Why? Because you can play unlocked levels outside the campaign and improve your score. The bonus levels are also a good idea: shooting fruits and vegetables or cans is a nice change of scenery.However, I largerly prefer the Heavy Fire games, for the scenario and for the action.Anyway, I'm perhaps mixed about the game but I'll recommand it for people that prefer a little more arcade than action and that prefer to shoot on objects than on humans.

												OVERVIEWReload is just what it claims to be: a MIL/LE simulation-style rail/range FPS, only, instead of shooting live baddies, you're shooting target representations of them in varying circumstances. In addition, some less combat-oriented levels are included. It accomplishes this premise in a mostly enjoyable fashion, with some flaws.GAMEPLAYThe levels are pretty well-designed and nicely explained, and it's not that difficult to get a handle on how things work, while also not being so easy that you're bored. The eyewear and camouflage unlockables are great touches that make obtaining platinum on levels feasible, while also adding a sense of accomplishment. There's enough variety in the types of levels to give the game good replay value. Enemies that shoot back in some levels are quite nice. Really dig the move-and-shoot factor on some stages. Controls are good.On the negative, the tutorial thingies are quite excessive. You should be able to turn them off. The F key is definitely your friend once you get the hang of the game. Also, in the first skeet shooting level, at least, when it says you have less ammo this go around, it's...meaningless, because you've still got hundreds and hundreds of rounds you won't need even if you're a terrible shot. Quite odd. Also, it's irritating that the game zooms in every single time you get a pumpkin or a small target in the sniper levels. The first times, fine; every time, no thanks. The grenade levels are poorly designed, as it's unclear as to what you have left to shoot. The most irritating factor of all is how poorly the reflexive fire rifle level is. Its platinum (and even gold) rating is absurdly difficult, not to mention that the two pop-up targets in the very back are nigh impossible (if not impossible?) to shoot (the shotgun level with hostages had a similar issues). The dot can be right on them and firing does nothing. Really bad hitboxes. In fact, that entire level is broken - you don't get any bonuses from one of the rounds, no matter how you do, which is probably exactly why platinum is borderline impossible.GRAPHICSQuite decent, once you change them to the highest resolution - why the default is so low, I'm not sure. There are some slight glitches, but overall it's quite nice.AUDIOSound is pretty good, from the instructor's voice to the gun effects. Music is OK and it fits well with the game.STORYYou're some random dude who's learning some mad skills. That's about it. I did, however, use these skills to save the girl I love and the world (plus every other world out there), so I guess the idea is to just create your own story in real life, like I did. Thanks, Reload!CONTENTNothing to say here. It's a clean, classy game in which you're preparing to toast bad guys 4 realz by toasting them in their simulated forms. Zero profanity, sexual content, worldview issues, or anything else.INTERFACEI'm assuming the word ""Interface"" works for this...Anyway, I'm talking about stuff like options and such. It's pretty basic but solid, with some problems, such as the aforementioned tutorial pop-ups, and the fact that, when you start a new career, it ditches all of the unlocked levels, too. That's...quite annoying. I assumed it would just delete campaign progress and that was it, letting you play all the scenarios straight through, but it doesn't. One other minor negative is that start-up is just a tad slow - staring at ""Copyright 2014"" (paraphrasing) gets old fast. Some other minor issues are, for instance, the lack of proper grammar in, ""Exit to windows?"", and it saying you unlocked two of...the same thing, or using ""Unlocked"" in reference to locked things (I can kinda understand the last one, but it's a bit weird. It would also be nice if it told you what some of the changes actually did (almost all are obvious). On El Presidente, it says to watch out for hostages...But there aren't any. Also, sometimes the game says, ""Better luck next time"", for...seemingly no reason. The ""All Weapons Drills"" don't work for me yet (I can't select anything), but it doesn't say why. In the mounted machine gun levels, reloading is still there even though it's irrelevant. (Note, of course, that a lot of these are quite minor, ""polish"" issues - I'm just trying to list everything I can, positive and negative.)CONCLUSIONThe more I played this, the more I liked it, which one other reviewer alluded to (more skill, more fun). For five bucks, it's not bad. Its simplicity is rather attractive. Overall, I think I'd give it about 6/10, maybe a 7. If you'd like a casual, at least remotely realistic FPS sim, then I'd recommend giving Reload a try.I hope you found my review helpful. Thanks for reading, and Godspeed.			"

												For any of you who may have watched the trailer, you're suspicions are confirmed. Its and point and click rail shooter, but hey this one is only $5 and doesn't crash for no reason like Rambo, also its not overpriced like Rambo.The game in total only has 21 levels in the career mode that can be replayed (mainly for achievement hunters like me), along with some bonus stages, 3/6 of them you get to choose you're weapon, sadly you can't use the mounted gun or any of the guns used in the final millitary stage (would have been nice to use the grenade launcher).For the majority of the time the game is ridiculously easy, the only time I ever got frustrated, is when I ""lost"" (using that word very loosely) at the aka-47 level, I got splated 10 times (due the aka-47 being the most annoying to use in the game) and I exspected to do the level all over again. To my surprise, the game kept my score and I got the platinum medal. Almost as if I did not lose at all. So if you are achievement hunting, those platinum medals are far more easy to get than you thought. You want you're game to have some form of punishment for loseing, naturally you don't want to punish you're players to badly to the point where they don't want to play anymore, yet at the same time you don't want to make the game so easy, that their is barely little to no punishment for losing.Multiplayer, at this point as far as I know, is just a hot seat. Meaning you and you're friends ""localy"" take turns to see who can get the highest score. I can honestly say for a game like this, it might be the best thing the devs can up with.Honestly, for a rail shooter, its decent. Though nothing to jump through the roofs about. But definately more worth while to have in you're library and easier on your wallet than Rambo.6/10			"

												This is a damn good arcade shooter, makes me remember the good old days of playing Police Trainer at the bowling alley. The graphics are sharp and detailed, the sounds are amazingly realistic, and the handling of the guns feels great. I also love the buttrock soundtrack, and the instructor's voice as well. It makes the oldschool arcade nostalgia that much stronger. I give this a solid 10/10.			"

												Reload is a arcade FPS target range game.You can compare it a little with NES Duck Hunt game.Only thing you do is shoot... and hit targets only using the mouse.Maybe it sounds a little boring only on the contrary it a lot of fun.You have different modes to play though.Basic targets, moving targets, disk shooting and a lot more.Not to forget all the different weapons you may use in the game.After a while you become good at the game and it becomes even more fun to play the game.Game looks great and gives a beautiful but disturbing effect while playing. I play the game at low resolution.There is no online multiplayer only old school hotseat mode.I think game like this are great with lightguns like from the consoles or arcade.That gives that piece challenge and effect that a game needs.I know I played too much Time Crisis on my Playstation 1 system.People who have played these games on there consoles or arcade machines they know what i'm talking about.It is a fun game but has no real depth.I give it 6/10 score. And new stuff like online co-op multiplayer.			"

												Enjoyable arcade rail/skeet/target shooter. Most importantly controls are accurate and responsive.A good variety of weapons and modes keeping things a bit varied. Most modes are variations of standing still target shooting static and moving targets, some sniping and a few on rail levels. Guns sound & feel satisfying and nice rock/metal background music. Graphics aren't amazing but perfectly fine for the job running smooth with good high resolution and widescreen support. Weapon models and textures well done though.Good fun and nice practice for improving speed, muscle-memory, reflexes, accuracy ect in a cheep package. One those games you can keep coming back to having a quick blast now and then to scratch that itch or improve your score or another game's downloading.			"

												Reload is an on rails shooter where you train to use firearms, but will you want to play it ?Reload is simple, all you do is go through different objectives ranging from clay shooting, to terrorist takedown operations and target practice.  The game is simple and you use only four  buttons. Right and left mouse buttons to shoot and reload, space to hold your breath and shift to use iron sights for sniper rifles. It's all really simple. The soundtrack to this game is absolutely horrible. It makes me want to stab myself in the ear it's so bad. The gun sound effects are also horrible. It's some of the worst sound design for a game ever.The game also is really easy. Apart from the missions where you can fail, you can do literally nothing and you will win.  Out of curiosity , I decided to not shoot anyone and to my surprise I still finished the level.The game took me 2 hours to finish every level, but there's still a lot to do, like challenges and Multiplayer ( not sure if that works though). The game ran really smoothly from start to finish, but the only problem is the horrific resolutions and to my knowledge there's no way to fix it. Overall Reload is a really mediocre on rails shooter. I highly suggest skipping this and trying out something else like Blue Estate. I give Reload a 4/10			"

FPS...Kind of...I play a fairly large amount of first person shooters, and a look at my game time within that genre would expose that fact about me. Not mentioning names, but a few of them are some of the most played games on Steam. Where does this fit in with those? Eh...nowhere!What's good and bad about this game?There are several good things to say about this game, and not many bad things to say about it. This is definitely one of those, ""What You See Is What You Get,"" deals. You can get the entire point of the game if you play it for 10 minutes, and in this case, that's not an insult. It's rather fun!But to call it a game in that there is such a rewards system to keep you playing for a very long time, that's definitely not the case here. I'm recommending it for a very specific reason.I play a lot of shooters, but my aim sucks...This game is target training. Very, very well executed target training. The music is stock meh, the voice acting is funny, but also what you'd expect from this. It's voice acting that takes itself too seriously, and not seriously at all, at the same time. This has the great feel of something that would've come out 15 years ago, with the usefulness of a training tool for gamers that might be an interesting new direction. The game is called Reload, I think a good alternate title for it would be, learn to shoot better. Sure, aiming varies from game to game within the shooter genre, and there are some minor differences, but at essence, you have a reticule and a limited amount of time to pop off a few shots before you have to reload, and then, DINK! You're gone. Time to wait until the next round, or be frustrated that you keep dying so often. This game is an FPS boot camp. - It will teach you how to shoot. Not to dance, not to run, not to hide in little nooks and crannies. It will teach you how to shoot, pure and simple, and that's really saying something. As I just said, first person shooters are all pretty similar in the way that you have a reticule and need to shoot. This game is that boiled down to its very basic, and for five bucks, or as a bundle pickup, it's a steal. The added bonus of psychological boosts received from Steam achievements is just some icing on the cake. Not a complicated game, and barely a game at all. More of an, ""Improve your shot,"" trainer. 7/10 - throw down 5 dollars, get help with your aim. Worth the pocket change, for sure.			"

												There isn't much to this game, really. You click on stuff. Sometimes the stuff moves, or the mouse moves, or the camera moves, but the extent of the player's involvement is hovering the cursor over a target, and clicking. It's like if someone made a whole game out of the tutorial level of Modern Warfare 2, then made it an arcade shooter, then ported it to the PC.But you know what? It's... really fun. I have no clue why, no idea what makes it satasfying, but it is really oddly fun. It's just five bucks too. If it looks fun, get it.			"
