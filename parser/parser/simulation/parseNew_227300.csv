												It's just one of those games you can turn on the radio (Game has an interface for internet radio) and just space out as you're driving through Europe's highways. Great game, would recommend to every single person out there!			"

												This game is meditation, the thought-cleansing effect of driving a thousand kilometres along the highway cannot be understated. Occasionally poor AI choices behind the wheel may spike your blood pressure but overwhelmingly ETS2 is a relaxing thing to stick on after a rough day. And if that's not enough you can just drive into oncoming traffic in your indestructible death machine.An alternate title for this game could be ""Zen and the Art of Logistics"".			"

												Upon a winter's night quite coldI loaded up a game Steam soldThe trucking sim of much acclaimWhile thinking, “what a stupid game.”At first I tried to play my wayBy squishing peds and bringing pain“Where are the cops?” I asked myselfTrying to earn my place in Hell.But time went on I grew boredI'd do one run and then ignoreThis game that they’d called 'Comfy Truck'And then move on without a-BUT WAIT! I'm almost out of time!Just have some faith, I'll cross that line!But time was past and pay was dockedMy world was shattered, faith was rocked.“Well just one more.” I grumbled lowI loaded up and hit the road""I've got it now."" as off I wentSoon to delete local content.Passed peaceful pastures in the nightI saw a sunrise blinding brightI guess this game's not all that badThough not the best I've ever had.Pop playing on the radioIn harmony with my VolvoThis siren sought to bring me sleepWhile consciousness I fought to keep.I showed up, docked and dropped my chargeAt a nondescriptive harbor yard“Just one more time,” said my girlfriend“Tomorrow you can play again.”But no, I knew I couldn't stopThe needs of commerce never dropIf it be chemicals or steelI had to keep turning those wheels.So down the road I charged once moreThrough France, Poland and LuxembourgAnd soon a thought occurred to meCould this be what they call ‘comfy’?If slow and peaceful is your aimYou'll not do better than this gameNow just real quick here's a rundownSo you’re running when you hit the ground.You move cargo from A to BI'd recommend quite hastilyIf you do well and earn your payThen manage other drivers days.And so with that ends my reviewI hope maybe you’ll try it tooIn here you'll find no gun or knifeBut I enjoy the trucking life.

												Top-notch truck driving simulator.  With support for TrackIR, wheels and pedals, this game has become a gem of the simulation genre.Before having tried it, it's hard to see why this game will be so addicting.  I suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi-country Logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers.You ""level up"" various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo.Driving the trucks is a pleasure.  It's surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city, obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman.  That said, if you disable the speed-limiter in options (90kph) you can get a bit crazy, getting as high as 150kph+ on some routes, a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow!  Speed cameras will become your enemy though.Unfortunately the AI of the other traffic can at times frustrate.  In some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way, probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly.  Don't get me started on the kamikaze AI at roundabouts either.In any case, this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game.  Having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended, and if you have head-tracking equipment it's icing on the cake.			"

												As a retired truck driver of 40 years I never though I would end up playing a game about truck driving but I find it a pleasing experiance when I can travel the European roads which I traveled daily. The experiance is so realistic I would recomend this game to all who would like a glimps of the life of a European trucker without all the grind and hardship which goes along with the job. Congratulations SCS you have a realistic product even taking into account the suicidal AI.			"

												Much like my sentiments of Farming Simulator 2013, I fell in love with Euro Truck Simulator 2 and I have no idea why. Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage, but a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compelling.There is no way I can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab. You’re a truck driver, and are starting your own shipping company. You have to drive according to the law, take rest breaks, buy fuel, pay for upkeep. There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game, yet for what it is, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable. I recommend everyone to give it a try.			"

												This is the best Driving Simulator that i have come across. The details are great, the driving is excellent and the choice of trucks makes it hard to pick a favourite. I have 1000hrs.+ and amstill not getting tired of pointing the nose of my volvo down the road and hauling that cargo.The Developers are always on the ball -  upgrading, ironing out the little bugs that come up,integrating new routes and cities and making the trucks work and drive as authentic as possible.Not to forget the multiplayer mode which is a change from the single player version so if anyonegets bored it´s their own fault.To summon it up this is just a great Simulator.

What is Euro Truck Simulator 2?Well, basically you drive a truck and deliver trailers to your destinations across Europe. This game is from the people of SCS who made other Truck Simulator games, as referring to 18 Wheels Of Steel Series and Euro Truck SimulatorSeems boring to play if you do the same thing over and overIt sure seems like it does, I honestly thought when I first saw this game it seemed boring when I saw this. I gave the first Euro Truck Simulator a try and loved it. This game soul purpose is meant for people who want to kill the time that's worth it and love driving. Is it really all about driving?Actually, yes it is. It may seem like an easy task to do, but it's actually a challenge.You start off small as you drive for other companies and build your way up. You start with the very small tasks that you can get done within the first 20 minutes of your gameplay with the short trips. Eventually, you gain skills and level up as you go. You can use those skills to help you for traveling the longer distance and get higher payment as you complete the tasks. Eventually, when you get that steady income, you can own your own truck and make even MORE money. You start off with a small garage, and you'll be able to upgrade it and hire drivers as you go! Even yet, take the shortcut way taking out a loan! You pick on what to do!Is it Realistic?Yes, and no.It's really how you look at it. The Physics on this game isn't 'Top Notch' but it get's the job done. For example, you hit a vehicle you'll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision. If anything, you'll just get a fine. Speaking of fines, there are laws you have to follow. Such as speeding, Red Lights and Green Lights and so on. The weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as you're on the road. Gas and time is a big factor too. It's important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your Fuel up at times! Sleep is also needed! Note: Some of these features can be disabled in the future in-game, but will get rid of that 'Simulation' Feel.Is there Multiplayer?The game alone is more focused on the single player aspects. Although there is a mod where you can download and be able to drive with your friends and other people!Is there Mod Support?Heck Yes!You can find a lot of mods, such as custom trucks, map mods, Graphic Mods and more!Although alot of these mods aren't off the steam Workshop, you would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ETS2 Mod Page Is The DLC even worth it?Yes and noThere's a lot of DLC's shown off this game off the page, but half of them to me aren't worth getting. Most of them are for Paintjobs for your trucks. Even though the Steam Workshop Supplies Free Paintjobs Without even Paying.The important DLC's are the Map Expansions. These are the three Map Expansions you would likely want in the future- Euro Truck Simulator Going East- Euro Truck Simulator Scandanavia- Euro Truck Simulator Vive La FranceAll three of these Expansions alone will give you hours of fun for every single DLC. I have over 60 hours on this game, and only explored 67.32% of the map! That's because I took my time, and didn't rushThe Issues I had in the pastThere hasn't been that many issues in the past for me, I had rare crashes that happen here and there and stuttering problems, but that's likely my CPU bottlenecking my performance. The AI traffic can be brutal at times, making sudden stops ahead of you, or cutting you off simply. But this is a rare occurrence. Although take care as you put Mods into your game, some mods will crash your game at times, but that's often rare in that case.My Final Verdictif you love driving, this is a must have! I never had interest into trucks until I played this! The scenery all around you while driving is just..breathtaking. Enough where you just want to stop and admire the scenery around you! There's a wonderful Day/Night Transition, weather effects, going 90kmh in the UK is just great!For a Simulator, I'm giving this a 9/10. There has never EVER been a game like this before!			"

												This is easily one of the best games I've got in 2013, and will probably remain in my Steam Favorites list for a long time. I never played a game like this before and now it has me hooked. It keeps getting better!At first I was just enjoying the scenery, the gameplay of driving the trucks, taking different jobs, and leveling up my XP so I could make more money and buy my own truck (Volvo FH16 Globetrotter). Now I'm working to upgrade my truck and my business. The business part is pretty addictive too. You can take a loan, expand your first garage, start buying more trucks, and hire drivers to work for you. I'm anxious to get enough money to buy another garage somewhere else and start another fleet.You can not only use your skill points from XP to strategically improve your abilities and rewards one step at a time to make more money, you can do the same with your drivers (or choose to have their skills auto-balanced).The scenery is gorgeous and there are some nice little touches of different things to see on the road and in different cities.The changing weather and day/night transformations are great. Rain storms are awesome.Driving in Europe is really not that different than driving in North America. Although, for some reason driving in the UK made me a little nervous--maybe it's the little extra traffic; maybe it's just driving on the other side of the road; or maybe I was expecting The Stig to cross my path.I play with a  Driving Force GT wheel, and even though as a fan of racing games I at first had doubts about this game, I gotta say if you have a wheel you really should try this game. Everything about the game is pure pleasure, but the driving is not just enjoyable but challenging as well. Things like parking your trailer; traveling swiftly but balancing your trailer's loads around all kinds of bends, inclines and declines; driving at night; dealing with other drivers (watch out for the evil empire of busses!) and trying to overtake slow pokes who follow the speed limit; traveling as fast as you can and watching for speeding cameras and changing speed limits make this one of the best driving games I've ever played. Oh yeah, don't blow those red lights--all the tickets you could get for various things can really ad up on one trip.It actually is becoming a racing game as I'm travelling longer distances. Right now in order to not interrupt my delivery with rest stops and not be late (which costs money) or get fined for driving while tired (happened to me four times at the end of one trip), I'm trying to make my trips even faster. So I'm balancing my loads at top speeds, taking the ever changing curves of the road as gracefully as possible, putting the pedal to the metal but watching for speed cameras and changing speed limits (watch out for those road hazard areas and be careful in town), and trying to overtake just like in a racing game--but it's more challenging with opposing traffic on busy highways!It's also a great music game. Hit the road and use your in-game radio to tune into different internet stations or play your favorite music on a media player in the background (I recommend AIMP3, which has a great interface and features but is very low resource).I highly recommend ETS2! I hope they make more expansions, and I am looking forward to American Truck Simulator.			"

												It's very hard to hype this game up. You get into a truck with some cargo to deliver and hit the road accross a scaled down version of Europe. Over time you gain experience for things, like longer distances, more valuable cargo, etc. You can eventually buy your own truck(s), hire other drivers and expand your trucking empire and stuff.But basically, it's about driving heavy, sluggish trucks. I am having difficulties putting into words why any of this is fun. Perhaps fun isn't the right word at all.It's relaxing most of the time, satisfying, and sometimes tense.There's something in there about small moments. The moment where you pull out of the loading dock with your frozen peas or whatnot and find the highway. The moment where the countryside changes and you cross borders. The moment where the signs change and the language is different. The moment where you know you're almost there and are about to arrive. The moment where somewhere in the middle, it rained for a while, or got really dark. Or both. The moment where you missed your exit somewhere in belgium. The moment where you discovered you could listen to actual internet radio from within your truck, from a station that matches the country you're gently passing through.This is probably not something you'll want to sit at for multiple hours, but if you're anything like me, you'll keep coming back to it, running a delivery once in a while, because it's relaxing, and the moments are tantalizing. Oh also, there's a multiplayer mod. It's all of this except once in a while you will pass another guy going in the opposite direction. You'll both cheerfully honk your horns in greeting, then continue on your respective ways. I guess that's also another moment.I am actually fairly excited about all things VR and the Occulus rift for a multitude of reasons and games I'd like to experience with it, but my deepest secret about it is that I am really looking forward to playing ETS2 when the consumer version lands. Seriously. That's how much I enjoy this game.			"

												The Simulator you expect to never like but somehow fall in love with, Euro Truck Simulator 2 lets you experience the world of cargo haulage right at your PC and it does it very well for the most part. You start with nothing, just taking low paying jobs in the quick job menu but gradually you will expand your company until you have your very own fleet of trucks and truckers all across Europe.+Great graphics, the trucks and trailers in particular are very high quality+Large map made even larger by the Going East DLC and the Scandinavia expansion+The system of building up your company works well and as you improve as a driver it becomes easier to improve your company+It's a very relaxing game and is a perfect excuse to listen to music, podcasts or the radio+You can play your music or a radio station through the game's menu+Trucks have lots of customisation options+Lots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargo+The paint job packs are very high quality and in my opinion are worth their price (especially on sale)+Plenty of great mods and it's very easy to install mods+Controls are fully customisable+Plenty of different cargo types, especially with the High Power pack and some of the skills you can unlock+Several truck manufacturers with several truck designs each +Seat heights, lights used etc are all customisable+Has a photo mode with lots of different options allowing you to take plenty of nice shots of your truck+The devs run events which give you the opportunity to unlock exclusive content through the World of Trucks website+It's easy to progress through the game without taking loans from the bank which is good for players who want to maximise their rewards in-game+/-Pretty hard to play with a mouse and keyboard but this is more than made up for with the controller and wheel support, if you don't have a controller or a wheel you might find this significantly more challenging to play-The AI can be pretty poor sometimes, AI vehicles almost always travel faster than the speed limit, trucks in particular have acceleration faster than makes sense, cars will sometimes accelerate into you while you are turning rather than stop-Major cities do not resemble cities in anyway, they are very small and all cities have a similar layout (a repair shop, two distributors, somewhere to sleep and a garage)-Major cities do not have gas/petrol stations so you have to rely on service stations on major highways for fuel -Doesn't have different seasons which seems odd considering they run seasonal events, such as the Winter Holiday event (seeing as you had to deliver presents it would seem logical to have snow)Verdict:8.5Despite the game's flaws I find myself absolutely addicted to it and would recommend this to anyone, there's nothing quite like the open road especially when you're building a business empire.El K.

												It's like Skyrim with trucks!Except well, not. But it's a lot of fun, and it definitely gives the feeling of a completely open world that's just ready for you to explore. Hop right in a truck and start hauling freight for others, and earn enough money to buy your own fleet of vehicles and keep more of the profits to yourself.It's really two games in one, because in addition to the fairly robust truck driving simulation, there's a pretty great business management simulation as well where you can play some kind of Trucking Tycoon and grow a small business into a profitable little empire of trucks and drivers all across Europe.I have to admit, Euro Truck Simulator 2 really surprised me with just how fun it is to play. It's pretty challenging to get the hang of at first, but once you do, it's a pretty enjoyable (and even relaxing) experience. The thrill of discovery — and the desire for a little more cash to pay off loans, hire drivers, buy new trucks, expand garages, and customize rigs — keeps me taking just ""one more job"" again and again.

												I, I have never had this much fun in months. I got this game today and i just HAD to write a review.Day 1- Mom said go find a job.Found an AD for a truck driver job.Called got the Job. Got paid 3,000 euros the first day.Day 2- Woke up thinking ""why should i get paid half and work using a company's truck"".Went to work as usual and got paid 3,000. Commited lots of driving law infringements. Ended up getting a call from the bank that i am in debt and that i have negative funds in my accounts. (They were nice enough to give me funds to sort things out).Day 3- Said ""Screw it, i'm buying my own truck""Went to the bank, got a 100,000 Euros loan (Thanks Merkel) and bought a volvo (Should change license plate to Diretide soon).Now i make 8,000 euros a day. I still sleep inside a truck tho (Don't worry it's warm).What's next? Well i will probably save 180,000 euros to buy a garage and hire some employees and hit the road daily as usual. Life on the road never ends. Thank for everyone at SCS Software who worked on this. 10/10 Game totally recommended!			"

												Nominated for the ""We didn't think of everything"" Steam Award 2016 for the category: Best Lifetime Support by a Developer.I think SCS Software deserves this recognition for the continued support of this game ( and american truck sim) during its lifetime so far through patching, quality non-overprized dlc and the many news updates in their development process.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 puts you in the shoes of a.................. truck driver. You start out as any regular bloke being a hired driver and delivering various things with a given truck.After a few jobs you have the option to get a loan from the bank to buy your very own truck. This is where the game truly opens. With your own truck you can drive around anywhere in the map and explore it as you please. Jobs give a higher pay so you can profit something while also paying off your debt. After some jobs the bank will offer you another loan, so you can start your very own trucking company. You use that money to buy a few trucks and hire drivers to work for you. There is no objective in the game, you're free to do anything, but you could say the objective is to have the biggest trucking empire.The game does a very good job at keeping you driving, if you don't pay off your debts, it's game over, but that's not all. You need more experience levels to be able to customize your truck to the max and also acquire better trucks. There many trucks in this game. Iveco, Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, MAN and Renault; all with different models and configurations. The world extends from Aberdeen to Budapest, but there are mods that expands the map even more, such as TSM, which will open up parts of Italy, France, Spain and Northern Africa. Or the Scandinavia Promod, it opens up Denmark, Sweden and Norway.This game will probably never die all thanks to the modding community who make mods and the players who play them and the developers who never stop developing.

												I kept getting tickets for speeding and ramming people off the street.Then I played Euro Truck Simulator 2.On a serious note, this is one of the best ways to spend your time. The game has focus on some of the most popular truck brands in Europe, with many ways to customize your truck. Wonderful landscapes and screenshot possibilities, all while striving to create your very own trucking empire. Thousands of mods designed to enhance your gameplay ( aswell as an unofficial multiplayer mod, allowing you to form truck convoys with your friends ).Do it!			"

TL:DR? See ConclusionINTRODUCTION:Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) is a 2012 vehicle simulation game developed and self-published by SCS Software. It features a massive game world spanning most of mainland Europe, the British Isles, and Scandinavia with each of the cities being connected by the beautifully recreated road systems such as the German autobahn roads.  The game also offers detailed simulation mechanics for hardcore sim players while also offering an alternative 'automatic' mode for the more casual players or beginners such as myself.Although the game's primary and obvious gameplay mechanic consist of driving across Europe, it does feature additional mechanics to give the game a little more spice such as; a progression (level up) system where each level unlocks new cargos, trucks, upgrades and delivery conditions; Truck Company Management system where you manage a trucking company by purchasing / upgrading garages, trucks and hiring drivers to use them.  Start the game as a driver for hire and earn enough money to build your own trucking empire that will span the entirety of Europe.PROS:+ Beautiful graphics with detailed truck interiors, world environment, and road systems+ Good sound effects and assets+ Europe is vast and well detailed  giving individuality to each location you visit+ Good selection of trucks with a good upgrade and customization system+ Various cargo and delivery conditions+ Surprisingly contains a relevant progression (level-up) system+ Garage and Truck Company management system+ Offers different game modes to cater for both hardcore sim players, casuals, and beginners+ Easy modding capabilities+ Very fast load times (Even on a mechanical hard drive)+ Live European Radio Streaming or custom music playlist using the in-game radio feature+ Has a demo in the Store page for anyone who's not sure if this genre is to their likingCONS:- Some micro-stuttering despite the FPS being above 60- Low number of pedestrians makes some parts of the cities a bit empty- Poor reward for manually parking a trailer (they could have at least given 100xp for it)- Anti-aliasing is limited to only MLAANEUTRAL:+/- The game's overall concept is for a narrow/niche audience.+/- The AI needs to attend a Road Courtesy and Discipline class. (Although this does add to the immersion since the player will have to exercise due diligence while driving)CONCLUSION:GREAT SIMULATION GAME. Playing this game is surprisingly stress relieving and gives off a zen-like feeling while also offering a lot of other contents within the game world. WORTH IT?:I can RECOMMEND this game at full price if you're a hardcore simulation fan but if not, I suggest you purchase this game on a sale. Either way however, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND purchasing the Delux Bundle which includes all available DLCs and Expansion Packs as well as SCS' other games such as Bus Simulator, Trucks & Trailers, and Euro Truck Simulator (1).FINAL NOTES:To be completely honest, I didn't think much of this game when I first bought it because I did not see the appeal in driving trucks around in a game without a plot or a story. I was, however, pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed the experience because what the game lacks in story (being a simulation game and all), it makes up for in solid gameplay, excellent presentation, and player-friendly game mechanics. The game carries with it a relatively high system requirement so be sure to check that out before making a purchase.--------------------------------------------------------- Like my Reviews?

												Simulation game, but newbie friendly. This game will please both starters and more advanced players although some will notice some lack of realism like no visual damage, game physics sometimes not so good and the lack of random events such as traffic accidents, road conditions, road works and random failures.--------Portuguese translation:O jogo é de simulação mas não é necessário estar acostumado com esse gênero de jogo. Vai agradar desde os iniciantes aos mais experientes, embora os mais exigentes possam ficar um pouco insatisfeitos com a falta de alguns elementos de realismo como falta de dano visual, física às vezes um pouco falha e uma certa falta de variabilidade do tráfego como acidentes, condições da estrada, falhas aleatórias, etc.			"

												Because of age and health issues I was stopped from driving unless I drove a hand adapted vehicle, which I declined. This game puts me again behind the wheel of a vehicle and I have spent in excess of 230 hours playing this simulator, I love this game and hope further expansion DLCs are soon forthcoming, the mods take this game even further, I have included American trucks, military mods and more paint jobs than I thought possible, immersed in the game you actually do feel as though you are on the road, the detail in trucks cities and countryside, and yes the A'holes that should never be allowed a license to drive are in the game, I let the AI know that if you do things to me I will do unto you, and I did, costing me £100s of pounds in repair bills and fines, but the satisfaction you get when you shove that car or truck into a river if one is close by is to much to resist, this game is for all ages, and I think it teaches all how to drive correctly, the young once familiar with driving a simulator like this will have no trouble obtaining a license, and keeping it clean, take your frustrations out on the traffic AI and drive squeaky clean in the real world, I highly recommend this game.

												honestly i don't even enjoy playing video games anymore. I feel so dead and empty inside all the time, nothing gives me any pleasure at all, the only reason i play anymore is as a distraction from the hole inside my heart. I come home from work and have nothing else to do because I'm so exhausted, so I'm just like ""what game should I play?"" Euro Truck Simulator 2, every time. Anything else requires too much commitment, I have to learn how to play the game and all the meta which isn't worth it since I couldn't possibly enjoy anything at this point, but this is just comfy as♥♥♥♥♥♥and immerses me in a world where I'm far more successful and own a small trucking company. I have 3 lil truckers in my company and i like to think about who they are/what they're doing and that's half the fun. When I fire people, I like to imagine myself pulling them into my office at the garage like ""Cameron, uhh, noticed you brought home a profit of only around 300 euros 3 trips in a row and then... huh... yeah, it looks like you couldn't even find a job and charged me 588 euros for maintenance and fuel? I mean, honestly, I've already hired your replacement, Jeff. Why don't you finish the route you're scheduled for and hand over the Volvo to Jeff. I'm sure he'll do a better job than you, you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥""EDIT: due to the rising popularity of this review, a surprising number of worthless NEETS have somehow found it appropriate to send me friend requests to ask if I will buy them a copy of this game. I have no idea where you guys get off thinking this is an okay or normal thing to do. It's rude enough to directly ask a friend to give you a gift, but it's a whole 'nother level of delusional entitlement to think it's okay to ask a stranger to spend their money to buy you a video game. If you were considering adding me to do this, try adding me on Skype instead so I can make eye contact with you while you kill yourself.			"

The thing about this game is that it is so relaxing, but at the same time very enjoyable. Think about coming home from a tough day at work or school, just depressed or tired. Just hop in your truck, turn on the radio, and diseapear into the land of the calm. I definately recommend this game. But as every game, it's not for everyone.

Posted: February 9
A quick introductionI will start by adressing the elephant in the room. Yes, the game has 2 steam awards, and yes, they are well-deserverd by the game for being the amazing simulator that it is. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not only a great experience that everyone can enjoy, but also a masterpiece in its own right. With such a large and active fanbase, the game grew with the help of its community: mods, multiplayer, new skins, trucks, etc., besides the huge amount of content it has been given from the developers. Official content is still being added to the game to the current day, be it in the form of patches, expansions or bug fixes. This makes my first point: buying ETS2 is a smart investment, since the developers truly care about the game and continue to update it and listen to their fanbase. I can make a quick prediction and say that ETS2 will still have updates or expansions coming out for at least a year or two more after the writing of this review. What exactly is Euro Truck Simulator 2? (Gameplay)ETS2 is a truck driving simulator, but not only that. It places you into the position of the manager of an entire international delivery company. The goal of the game, even though most players will just say it's to relax or to have fun (which is also true), is actually to expand your company, hire more drivers, buy more trucks, more garages and obtain the monopoly for deliveries in Europe. The game takes this simple concept and manages to add an astonishing complexity to it (at first sight only, because after the first 20 hours or less in-game, you'll realize that the gameplay is actually simple and enjoyable). As the manager, you can also make deliveries yourself, which is how you will get your company up and running before you have the money to hire drivers to do that for you. You will start by doing quick jobs for various employers, with a truck given by them for the specific delivery, and your first objective is to buy your own truck so you can start taking jobs from the freight market, which get you more income. Once you get your own truck, it's all yours: you need to take good care of it, repairing it, refuelling it, being careful not to get fined for your actions on the road, and so on. From that point onward it is your job to build a strong and succesful business. As you do more deliveries and manage to get more experience (both literally, for leveling up, and figuratively, because you will learn the mechanics of the game better and better), you will earn skill points with each level up. There are a variety of skills to choose from, including getting better pay for different types of jobs (fragile cargo, urgent deliveries, ADR deliveries, valuable cargo), less consumption of fuel, or being able to deliver cargo across longer distances. Your employees also have skills, a feature that on its own opens lots of possibilities for company management. If the information here or on the store page doesn't quite answer all of your questions, I'll tell you that there is also a demo for this game available to download on Steam so you can try the game out. But is it accurate? (Driving mechanics)Before I start explaining the mechanics of the game, please take note that I'm not a truck driver and have never driven a truck before, so excuse me if I don't have all of my facts straight. From my 90 hours of playing the game at the time of writing this review, I'd say that the driving in this game is absolutely beautiful. First of all, the complexity of the mechanics is fully customizable, so everyone from the newest player to the veteran trucker are able to enjoy the game. The driving is relaxing, be it day or night, rain or sun, highway or forest road, because it doesn't require that much focusing, but only as much as to not pass the speed limit, to avoid other people in traffic and to not come tumbling off the road. That gives you time to enjoy the wonderful scenes you'll pass by, which I'll be talking about in the next section. On-board the truck you have every switch you need, meaning headlights, wipers, the horns (air, regular, light), the handbrake, the toggle for high beams, for the beacon and the turning signals. It has everything you would want and need from a proper simulator of real life driving, so don't expect a truck racing game. The only thing that is a tiny bit more difficult is the parking, but there's also a solution for that. The parking is skippable in every delivery, while denying you a small amount of experience. But as you gather more knowledge and start learning what's what, parking should immediately become a breeze after a few hours of gameplay.Also, going a little off-topic, you also have a radio. You can upload your own playlist of music into the game and listen to it while on the road. Genius. Genius, I say. That's all well and good, but how does it look? (Graphics)Do not go into the game expecting it to look like it was made with Unreal Engine 32. The game came out a good amount of time ago (I'd even go as far as to call it a classic now, heh), and I can say it still looks decent to this day. The in-game world still is wonderful if you're willing to sit for a bit and think about how old the game is. Even if it doesn't have the latest graphics, ETS2 doesn't fail to impress, making up for raw graphical power in great world design. The landscapes in the game are beautiful, and the vehicle models still manage to look good and blend into the environment perfectly, giving the game a really special ambiance and relaxing potential. It is easy to get immersed into the massive world and if you're not careful you can lose hours driving your virtual truck around (as it happens to me quite often).But if I were honest, the question here is how good you can make it look. As I have said before, the game has such an active community, and modders are no exception. There are a variety of graphic mods to choose from both in the Steam Workshop and outside of it that do a wonderful job at enhancing your visual experience, making the game not only graphically impressing, but also making you want to get into the photo mode and snap some shots of your journey through ETS2's Europe. So...did you enjoy it? (My personal experience)The short answer would be yes, absolutely. But the answer worthy of this review is that I just spent so many hours into this game, in which everything you basically do, if we were to dumb it down to an extreme level, is drive around and turn left or right at some points, and I can't even explain why exactly. ETS2 just has a mesmerizing atmosphere to it, making the game beautiful in its own way, and being one of the most relaxing games I have and will ever play. Other simulators can't even get near its level (except American Truck Simulator, made by the same developers and based on the same concept), because for me, ETS2 will always have that je ne sais quois, that *something* which always makes me come back to it and do yet another delivery, over and over again. In other words, everything about the game is enjoyable, from the relaxing driving to the sweet feeling of getting another truck or further customzing your current one, to the trance induced by the exquisite feeling of being alone with the road, and for that, Euro Truck Simulator 2 wil always and forever have a special place in my heart.ConclusionIf you are looking for a relaxing driving experience with various customization options, a variety of trucks, perfect world design, mesmerizing atmosphere and most of all, a detailed company management gameplay component, then I am sure you will not regret buying this game. If you need further convincing, please do download the demo (which is available on Steam).			"

												I'm a 35 year old female who doesn't drive in real life, somehow I'm addicted to this game!I bought this after Christmas in the winter sale (also bought the DLC scandinavia and going east) and already have nearly 200hours of playtime on it and I'm ranked 33 ingame with 10 garages and a bunch of drivers, working on achievements now.So why do I love this game?! Erm ..well even on the simpliest driving settings (I play using keyboard and mouse) I've come a long way and  learned so much about driving a truck and actually getting an education about city names in europe lol In my first few days I wasn't using lights half the time, cruise control, indicating, looking left and right at junctions, moving lanes in time on the motorways (and hitting barriers/other vehicles) I was getting fined for everything...including falling asleep at the wheel. Keep your fuel tank topped up too or find out the hard way when you run out and need a tow lol I can now do the harder reverse parking and yesterday I finally got the achievement for no fines/damage and in-time urgent delivery for 1000km lol a real achievement for me :)This game is fun in many ways, I like recruiting new drivers and training them in certain areas (kind of in my head give them a backstory! Like Ethan who I recruited and is based at my Cambridge branch is most skilled at delivering expensive cargo, he comes from a rich family that think hes at Uni but hes dropped out to ""travel europe"" literally!)I also love seeing real landmarks in cities like the fortress in Salzburg, along with the beautiful mountains.Anyway, so even if you're not usually into driving games - this might surprise you! Definately value for money :)			"

												Journal Entry 1 Its my first day running my new company ""Marauder Trucking"" I took out a huge loan from the bank scored myself a sick looking Volvo truck, im ready for action. Journal Entry 2 I'm new to driving a vehicle with this many gears and new to shifting manually with a clutch but I think I got it under control.... then I back up straight into the side of a small van... so no im not under control.... I've now damaged my truck to 8% and cost myself a pretty penny for the accident..... But hey we all gotta learn sometime right? Journal Entry 3 After driving around my small property parking lot and learning my gears I decide to venture to the populated streets! I backup (this time checking my mirrors) and carefully pull onto the street. I'm now happily driving among the traffic of Europe! The drivers a slow and waiting at lights is a pain in the rear...but... alas this is my life now ... Journal Entry 4 I have picked a mission to haul a load of heavy machinery across the countryside. I drive to my location, which happens to be a nice little farm with very tight corners and fences. I see my load waiting between two other loaded trailers, this looks like a tight fit. I attempted backing up several times not getting it right, I'm sure the farmer and his wife were either giggling inside their house or regretting not hiring a better driver. I finally get latched on and give a sigh of relief, I pull out of the space and very gently make my turns while trying not to stall out. Although its tight maneuvering I am able to escape Vincent's Smoked Meats! Journal Entry 5 Now on the road I get to enjoy the beautiful countryside and shake my fist at the slow and dangerous drivers around me.... it begins to get a bit darker and a light rain starts, I almost drive my truck off the road twice trying to turn on my headlights and windshield wipers but were all good. I'm now cruising down the road at a gentle 70 and things are good....uh oh.....I can see a line of cars piling up behind me so I better pick up the pace... This was a poor decision on my part... Journal Entry 6 Now thinking back... in the best interest of other drivers I should have just stayed the speed I was going.... but I did not. I got far to generous with the gas pedal and shifting, ended up pumping my truck up to around 120. This speed was great, I was making good time, I didn't have a line of cars behind me.... but I didn't account for sharp corners in my equation. I came whipping up to a corner thinking... ok ill just tap the brakes and slow down a bit.... well its wet on the road.... its a sharp corner... I got it down to about 98 when i hit the corner and suddenly my world started to become slightly off center... Journal Entry 7 Now that my truck is laying on its side I've learned a key element about gear reduction to control speed as well as ""when to"" and ""when not to"" apply the brakes. I had missed my corner by lots...I had not taken into account the grade % of the road and I rolled it and slid for a long distance... it was quite scary......After my truck is up righted from the long skid on its side im now looking at 72% damage, the truck sounds like a blender full of ball bearings and the lights flicker.... that's totally normal right? ... Journal Entry 8 Ok the truck sounds terrible but it still drives... Its got horrible turning now and 3 of my gears are non existent... I'm still about 2 (game hours) away from my destination. I am able to drive for about 45 mins before the truck really starts to have...issues... I was driving along at my new cautious speed of 50 and suddenly my truck turns off.... great no power steering so my wheel locks up and its like trying to steer a dead whale with a pool cue....not working well.... but I'm able to get it to the side of the road safely. Journal Entry 9 I am able to start the truck again and drive another while before it turns off again. I'm now only 20 mins away from my destination and im not giving up... if its the last thing I do im getting this load to its destination. I've now cranked this thing over enough times that I could probably forge a blade on the starter.... but luck has it that the final stretch into town is all down hill....yay!..... throw it in neutral and coast into the city... I blast my horn and coast powerlessly through red lights, dodging traffic and jumping curves. I look like a boat without a crew heading directly for the shore. Journal Entry 10 I can see the building! I'm almost there! .. I'm coasting much much slower now that the terrain has leveled out, The truck won't even start now its toast, im about 30 feet from the buildings entrance and moving at a speed of about 5-7... Old ladies with walkers are getting better torque ratios then my truck. I finally land right next to the door, Unable to start the truck im not going to be able to back it in manually so we will take a gimme on this load.... this may be bad for my business but I can personally suggest you don't hire anyone from ""Marauder Trucking""			"

 Euro Truck Simulator 2 Review! Well where to Start with this game!I've played this game since day one, even before it hit the steam release with over 1000 hours. The game itself unmodded provides great entertainment if you enjoy to just relax at your computer and just drive. If you're wanting a great simulation aspect, this game can deliver on many levels and provide simulation like the real thing!Speaking of modding, this game provides a massive range of modding features to improve and drastically extend your gameplay, I personally play a modded game most of the time, as I've expereince most of the game and what it offers in the unmodded version, but to this day mods still make the game very fresh and new to play!Overall I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys driving games, with a very open aspect to modding. The graphics are beautiful and are very eye appealing, but another good thing is that the specs aren't too high to play the game! "

Do you know what sucks?School, if you’re still working your way through the education system you have my sympathies.Sure, it’s important, you need an education, if you couldn’t read you wouldn’t be here with me right now, but it does have a huge downside.It’s dull; there are a hundred other things you’d rather be doing. You’re forced to go there every day and you don’t get paid for it, they even test you to judge your intellect against your peers.Then there are the cliques, the cool kids, the jocks, the nerds, it’s a social minefield of awkwardness.As if being trapped there all day isn’t enough, they even give you work they expect you to do at home!School was a pressure filled, judgemental nightmare and one which I was glad to survive.Do you know what else sucks?Work, sure you’ve survived the “best days of your life” and now you’re out in the real world.People are treating you like a grown up (not that you feel any older or wiser than you did at school).Statistically you’ve probably found yourself in a “ground-hog day” of 9-5 soul destroying office mediocrity, you’ve got a boss you don’t like and a desk you can never leave.Sure you’re being paid now, but the “bank of mom and dad” has closed.You don’t think you’re being paid enough for what you do anyway and there’s always a relentless pile of bills demanding your hard earned money.If you are lucky enough to have a little money left to buy a game or two at the end of the month, you almost certainly won’t have the free time to actually play them.You know I miss school; they were the best days of my life....Greener GrassI often sit at work, questioning my poor decision making skills which have bought me to my particular running lane in the rat race.There must be plenty of jobs out there which don’t chain you to a desk all day whilst “the metaphorical man” breathes down your neck.Surely there are people who aren’t trapped in the same “Yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir” tedium in which I’ve somehow managed to imprison myself.Zen SimulatorBut I have managed to find a port in the storm that is my existence, a bubble of calm escapism which grants a little respite to my jaded soul.This soul medicine comes in the form of what I like to call the “Zen Simulator”.You know the sort of game where you can do something repetitive, something that doesn’t require too much thought but still rewards you for your efforts. Farming “Zen-ulator”Farming Simulator 2015 is a great example of a “Zen Simulator”, you trundle around in a tractor ploughing your fields, planting your crops and generally reaping what you sow.The “reward hook” is the money you get from selling your produce to buy better tractors to trundle around in and more fields to tend.It’s a million miles away from the adrenalin fuelled FPS titles I find myself playing at the weekends,The Zen simulator is the perfect genre to escape into after a hard day of work or school and now I’ve discovered that driving a truck can be just as therapeutic as chugging around the countryside in a tractor.Euro Truck “Zen-ulator” 2Euro Truck Simulator 2 is another perfect example of a “Zen Sim”.You start the game running delivery contracts for other people.You can peruse a list jobs requesting cargo to be picked from and delivered to various locations around Europe.You pick a job from the list, (your choice might not only be based on the payout of a job, I’ve found myself picking contracts just because I like the idea of driving to particular delivery destination. ) then you find yourself sitting in the rig provided by your employer, trailer all hooked up and ready to go. They’ve even already set the sat nav. for you!Drink and DriveThe core of Euro Truck Simulator 2 is spent driving along the highways and byways of Europe.This is a driving simulator, not a racing game; you’ll want to take care of whatever Big-Rig you find yourself in.Damage it and the repair costs will come out of your fee.You’ll also want to drive responsibly; running red lights will cost you, as will getting caught by speed cameras.Why would you want to rush anyway when you’ve got some beautiful European scenery to drink in as you drive?It’s about the Journey, Not the DestinationThe scenery is where Euro Truck Simulator 2 shines, this is a game that understands it’s the journey that’s important, your destination is just another way point to pause at.As you put your “pedal to the metal” and open your rig up on the motorways of Europe you’ll be treated to a lush and changing landscape racing passed your windscreen.Don’t get too distracted looking at the pretty fields of sunflowers though or you might miss your exit (or worse hit another vehicle and damage your truck!)A Continent of PossibilitiesThere are 69 European cities present in the vanilla game spread across a dozen countries.(You can add more via DLC too!)Each city has its own unique real world land marks or iconic buildings present, you can often see them looming over other city buildings as you wind your way through the suburbs.It’s a really nice touch to be able to recognise which city you’re approaching from the skyline without having to check the sat nav. or map.  Don’t go into this thinking it’s an exact recreation of Europe though or you’ll be disappointed.Euro Truck Simulator 2 adopts the same stance to mapping the European Continent as “The Crew” does to mapping North America.What you have here is a condensed version of Europe, which is probably just as well, I think driving from Southern Italy to Northern England in real time might take a little while longer than the normal hour or two I have spare in the evenings.Points on your LicenseIt’s not just about driving around making money either (well it is, but there are extra game mechanics to keep things interesting).There’s an experience based progression system here too.As you drive around, completing deliveries, you’ll earn points which you can spend to unlock new capabilities.You can invest points several different areas,  for example, you could focus your experience points in haulage distant which will make longer distance contracts available to you or you could invest points in licences for various types of hazardous cargo if you like the idea of trucking some dangerous chemicals around Europe.The Boss of YouWhen you’ve amassed enough wealth from “working for the man” you can invest in your own truck (there are plenty of models and varieties to choose from) and start your own haulage company.This not only gives you more freedom with regards to delivery contracts, but also gives you the chance to invest future earnings in upgrading your rig, whether that is an engine upgrade or go faster stripes, that’s up to you.There are plenty of stylish paint jobs you can pick as DLC too, should you like a more personalised look to your truck of choice.Drive SafeBeing your own boss isn’t all parts and paint jobs either, it comes with an extra layer of responsibility too.It’ll be up to you to pull in at the services and fill up the gas tank from time to time now; running out of gas whilst on a long haul is not a good idea.It’s also not a good idea to keep driving without a rest too, everyone needs sleep and you’re no exception so remember to keep an eye on your fatigue levels and pull in for a nap when you need one!You’re also going to have to pay for maintenance on your truck now, so it’s even more important ... <...snip...>( To view the full review (and others) please take the time to visit  review-well.com [www.review-well.com] )			"

												A LOT more fun than it should be.1. Find Job 2. Gather trailer 3. Deliver trailer - Get paid... ""i guess that can be fun...?""Maybe it's the idea of creating and expanding a business. Maybe it's that wierd infatuation people have with locomotives . Maybe it's just a cool job that works perfect for an easy going simulator.It's just good fun. Jump in and out, no hassle. Simple and relaxing.Your only objective is to create a successful business and ultimately: earn money. Money buys accesssories and upgrades for your trucks, along with recruiting drivers and buying garages. Naturally your truck is the whole game, so customizing and improving it is your primary motivation. Working towards unlocks is a major incentive to keep you engaged.  There is a also a huge community with tons of fantastic mods to try out. They're easy to use and the content is full of good work. There are enough mods to improve upon nearly every aspect of the game. There are a lot of sites with a lot of re-uploads and out-of-date crap, so It took me a while to sift through to find the ones i wanted. But it was totally worth it, I have an awesome menagerie of mods.Its an otherwise pretty dull scenario for a game, there isnt a whole lot more underneath than what's delivered at face value. There isnt anything truly unique or special about it. A European truck driving simulator, you shouldnt think much of it...But even if you have a remote interest, it might be enough to get some real enjoyment out of this. "

Posted: January 16, 2016
												I did a review before, Back then i had 17 Hours playtime. Now i gained a lot more hours on it :DBack then my Review was not very detailed and  since then Euro Truck Simulator 2 got updated constantly and has much more to offer by now, i decided to redo my review. So let's begin shall we? :3(For those who don't want to read a book and expect a review in form of an IGN Joke - 10/10 would relax again)The General Idea of the Game/Whats it aboutThe easiest answer would obviously be ""Driving Trucks"" B-But wait! That's not all there is to know silly. This game is in all reality a ""Relax and listen to a Podcast/Music while you drive Simulator"". This game is about you, your truck and an open Europe to travel across. How you do it, what trucks you will drive, what cargo you will haul or the places you will see is all up to you. GameplayGame Start and Quick JobsThe game starts you off as a hired driver. You have no money, no truck and only a rusty empty garage to work with. So what do you do? You work your butt off with ""Quick Jobs"" In these jobs you will get put inside a truck and just drive to the destination. In this starting phase of the game your goal should be to make as much Money as possible and of course to level up (More to the level system below). Freight Market and your own TruckAfter you are level 6 or 7, which is about 2 hours in the game, you finally have enough Money to buy your first truck!(You could also take a bank loan and do it faster. This is where the game starts to become fun and somewhat addicting. There you sit. In your own little truck, in your rusty garage. What now? Now you can start making the big money. Instead of getting hired for an apple and a hug, you will now be paid directly by the Companies. All that freight money goes into your pocket. So you select a freight from the ""Freight Market"" Unlike ""Quick Jobs"" you will not just spawn in place. You have to physically drive to the loading spot. So don't choose something on the other side of the Country because you will have to drive there. This will be your life from now on. You pick a job, you drive to the loading dock, pick it up, and deliver it to the destination. Then you will get paid, and based on how you did you will get rated with XP to level up. The Level System:As mentioned many many times above. The game has a level system. You earn XP to spend in the following categories to unlock freight and boost income.  Skill Description   ADR Lets you haul more dangerous cargo like gasoline or toxic stuff   Long Distance Lets you take on jobs with a longer distance which will be higher paid   High Value Cargo Expensive equipment such as diggers and forklifts   Fragile Cargo Glass, Cars, Electronics and so on   Just-in-time Delivery Deliveries with a shorter but more rewarding deadline   Ecodriving Makes your trucks consume lesser fuel In addition to your own skillset, your hired drivers will also level up in these. Which makes a level 30 driver far more productive than a rookie. Hired drivers brings us to the next aspect: Management The Management AspectAfter you made some Money, leveled up, bought more trucks and upgraded + bought new garages. You should start hiring drivers on your own. They will deliver cargo for you, just like you do. You equip them with a truck and they will bring in money. At first very little, up to 1000€. But soon you will have lots of drivers, and the higher their level, the more money they will make you. In the late game you will have so much money that you don't know what to do with it. Which is one of my biggest concern about the game. Once you reach a certain point you will just never run out of money. You will have millions and millions. Which makes it so the late game is literally only about the driving aspect. Which is not a major problem for me, but it might be for you, so please keep that in mind.TuningAs your level grows you will unlock more trucks and more parts for you to customize your truck with. You can even install mods that add more tuning parts. (Like you can install mods for basically everything in this game) You can also upgrade the trucks of your hired drivers, though that doesn't really do much since you won't see them on the road. :DGraphics, Audio and PerformanceGraphicsDon't expect Crysis. But the game looks beautiful enough in my opinion. The weather effects just got overhauled and I catch myself sitting there thinking ""What an amazing View, lets take a Screenshot of that"" far more often than in a lot of other Games. The Truck models look beautiful and they are all fully licensed. The Dashboards all are functional and you really feel the love SCS (the developer) has put into them. I had some odd Shadow bugs earlier on but it seems they have been fixed since thenAudioThis is one of the strongest aspects of this game. To be fair, SCS improved quite a lot here as well, compared to when the game was first released. From the sound of rain dripping on your cabin, to the rumbling of a thunderstorm, the sounds are just beautiful. The trucks themselves sound amazing! And not just the engine sounds, also the little levers in the truck itself has sound, and it just helps to immerse you in this game so much. Only the beeping sound. when you reverse from inside the cabin is way too loud in my personal opinion. I have never used a sound Mod since playing this game. I know they exist, and of course I use them for modded trucks but i never used one that changes the original sounds, but i just never felt the need to do so.PerformanceNow i have to say my PC is one of the weakest. I'm still using an old ATI HD4650 and a dual core processor, but I can get the game to a steady 30-35 FPS (20 in cities) on Medium Settings. If you use mods, especially big ones, such as the ProMods Map or the TSM Map, that number will obviously decrease, but I'm very happy with that aspect of the game.Pros and Cons + VerdictPros+ Fun and Relaxing Driving+ Fully Licensed Trucks+ Customization+ Big and Active Modding Community incl. a MP Mod+ Decent AI+ Amazing Audio+ Great Performance+ Good Looking+ Full Steering Wheel and Controller SupportCons- Late Game far too Easy- Managment Aspect not deep enoughVerdictIts one of my favorite driving games and the fact that I can only find 2 flaws with it makes me give it a strong 95%. If you are into trucks, or just want a relaxing open world driving game, get it.			"

												This is not goat simulator, or grass simulator, or bread simulator, or another ""stupid"" simulator. This is truck simulator, so your job is driving a truck, delivering stuff across Europe. So far as a casual gamer, I didn't find it hard to drive these trucks. Though the AI can be ridiculuos stupid.So.. you started to get a job, using company's truck. Get some money to buy your own truck so you can start building your own empire.. ehh I mean company. And then buy a garage. Buy trucks and hire drivers. Buy garages in every town. Upgrade your garages. Manage your trucks, your drivers and your garages because you're the boss.Also, I love how the developer works on this game. Not like *ahem* unity stuff.You will feel bored 'cause of it's repetitiveness. But sometimes, you will back to drive your trucks again. And then bored, and then drive it again, and feel bored again. And again. Overall, 9/10. Recommended for fans of driving games. Sorry for bad english, **** my grammar <3			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 - the smash hit no one saw coming. Buy and customise your own fully licenced and detailed truck from any of the seven truck manufacturers (Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, MAN, DAF, Iveco and Renault) then haul good around Europe's cities. Earn money, level up, buy garages and more trucks then hire workers to drive them. Build a trucking empire whilst traveling across beautiful scenery with realistic-looking sunrises, sunsets, fog and rain. Works with keyboard, mouse, game controllers and steering wheels, not to mention TrackIR and Oculus Rift. With great mod support and regular DLC, this game remains fun and enjoyable almost three years after release. Just buy it, then you'll understand.			"

												I love this simulation, the graphics are awesome and SCS does a great job with updates to the game and I don't mean just fixing problems they also add a lot of new things to the game as well. I would consider the game to be of medium difficulty.  Besides driving routes there is some managerial tasks in the game as well. Once you get some money going you can form your own company. Once you do this you will be buying garages and upgrading them, hiring drivers and also buying trucks and upgrading those as well if you wish. Besides hiring drivers you can also decide what the train in for their skills as well. The map you drive consists mostly of central europe and the UK as well. Going east adds  a few countries of course from the east.  I would recommend this game to any simulator fan.**Update- Since I have written this review, the game has added the Scandanavia map, as well as many other updates to the game making it even better! Some of the DLC really adds things to the game too, like being able to customize your cabin. And soon there will be a France map update as well. The game is totally worth the price and will give sim fans great fun for the dough.			"

												For some reason, my review got 'deleted' even though I could still read the comments, and it was marked 'not recommended' instead of 'recommended.' No idea what happened there, so this is my 'second' review.Naturally, I do highly recommend this game. It's the best 'driving' (you don't race in it) game I've ever played. Initially I was turned off by this game because of the whole 'truck' thing. I love the idea of travelling hundreds of miles on an open-ended map, but I don't care much for trucks. I'd rather drive a car. That said, I tried out the demo (hey, I've got nothing to lose) and got hooked immediately. While still not a totally realistic simulation of a truck driver, I learned that driving a truck is nothing at all like driving a car but I had gotten used to it quickly (gotta go wide when turning). The best part of the game is when you're actually out on the road. With your own MP3s playing (or one of the many radio streams you can turn on), and miles of open road in front of you, ETS 2 is the ultimate game to unwind. If you're all stressed out (from work, etc), play this game. There's no aliens to kill, or kittens to run over. It's just you chilling out in  your truck (with your cargo if you have a delivery) while singing Animaniacs songs (no really, that's one of the music I listen to while on the road) off key.Rain effects are really good, although there's no other types of weather. The maps aren't exact representations but they are perfectly balanced enough so that those long jobs (say from Warsaw to Aberdeen) don't feel that long.Cities aren't that interesting, but you rarely spend much time in any anyway, as you're mostly on the road. Going East (the DLC) adds much improved cities though,Some of the roads are questionable, and there's no penalty for delivering cargo earlier than the scheduled time, which are some of the little flaws in an otherwise excellent package. Form your own truck company, buy trucks and hire drivers to drive those trucks. Expand by buying garages for your company. Take deliveries and earn experience and money, or simply drive around in free roam and let your drivers do all the work.Ignore all the people who scoff at this game. I haven't heard of anyone in forums, etc, who, after playing the demo, -didn't- buy it afterwards. It's engrossing and the relaxation factor is high. SCS Software has been making truck driving games for years, so they sure know what they're doing. ETS 2 is the best of them all.P.S. American Truck Simulator is in the works. If it's anything like ETS 2, it will be yet another excellent game.			"

												So... modded the game with promods after buying both map DLCs, got a bunch of trailer mods as well, and I got a contract to take some crazy metal gear looking 66t construction machine tracks across France, Britain, Faroe Islands and half way across Iceland to some quarry, that for some reason was on top of a hill with the sh!ttiest, snowiest, slipperiest, zig-zagiest road leading up to it... not surprisingly, my 730 hp Scania took a sh!t and I had to give up the job just 2 km away from the destination, after over three and a freakin half real time hours spent driving the f@cker all the way up there... You know what I did? I picked up another contract and continued playing this amazing game, GET IT NOW!!1			"

												Picked the United Kingdom as my starting location. Slowly pulled truck out into the road, straightened out the trailer and began my adventure across the UK. Then a small hatchback slammed on the brakes when it was only one care length ahead, couldn't brake in time and ended up rear ending the car. Also got fined for hitting the car.10/10 Best British traffic simulator ever.			"

Introduction:Want to get some relax? Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the game just for your needs!Good: amazing graphics (though release date is 17 Jan/2013); really awesome landscapes; a great variety of cargo; trucks customization; unbelievable amount of mods; open world; the interest is also kept via portal http://www.worldoftrucks.com/ - sign in and you will see more; the game is updated and looks like there is no end of devs ideas;Bad: no exhaust (yes mate, I heard about ecology in Europe and Greenpeace but truck without exhaust isn't complete; physics (a lot of people say: physics is really good but I can't understand why If I crash at 80mph I can just go further and see nothing is visually broken); no multiplayer (yes mate, there are some mods but I don't like them if they are not supported by devs; no trails from wheels (you hit the brakes and see nothing also no sound for extreme braking); too much DLCs and you have to pay a lot if you want to get full game (Scandinavia | Vive la France are extremely required to get 100% achievements) but you can't buy them in steam bundle;In total: 9 / 10A shortlist of things to be added by devs but they will never do: Update the game to a new engine supporting DX10-12 etc...  Seasons; A noise of drops when it rains; Add trails from wheels for extreme braking cases and sounds for it; Police should patrule the roads :-) An exhaust (Yes, I'd like to see those dark clouds when I push pedal to the metal); Fulfill empty buses on the roads (Fun to see empty bus on the roads of Neverland);P.S.: so 90h is enough for me, sorry but will not play it anymore. May be some when when I'll get all those DLCs.			"

												There was a time I had everything perfect in my life, a beautiful wife and kids, a great job, but there was always something missing. Even after fantastic sex with my scandinavian model wife, I would lie awake and feel empty, hopeless, and souless. That was when a friend gifted me eurotruck simulator 2. Everything Changed. No longer did I feel lost, but more alive than EVER! I quit my highly sucessful job, divorced my wife and disowned my kids. I didn't need them anymore because any thoughts of them were replaced with the greatest game in the world. On nights I normally would have spent at partys or hanging out with Obama, I now spent preparing for the long drives from Aberdeen to Bratislava. I now live with my cousin Jeff who also is a ETS2 Fantic! We spend our time not gaming talking about different trucks or routes to travel on. I got a new girlfriend who works at a gas station, she knows a lot about trucks and it makes me aroused. One time we ♥♥♥♥ed in the back of a Scania AB. It was so hot I ♥♥♥♥ed all over the clutch. You should have been there that filthy♥♥♥♥♥♥was poping my clutch all night. I'm getting so stimulated thinking about it I might have to go for a stroke, maybe pop one into Jeff. The game is great and goes good with a G27 and eyefinity. Hoping for Oculus rift support in the future. Game Of The Year All YearsUpdate: I have found the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, he now joins in my mighty truck quests.			"

												-Got this game off the internet for free as a joke-Absolutely fell in love with it-Deleted the cracked version, went on steam and bought the game and a lot of DLCs just because I think the developers really deserve every penny of the money. Though this is not an action game, it's really stress relieving and relaxing to stand back and do your trucking!No joke, guys, Beware if you buy this game. It can really get to your mind.UPDATE: Alright so I've been playing this game a lot recently. I don't mean to get all sensible and stuff and fuss this much over a game but my life has literally improved because of this. I don't know, man, you sort of start to feel like this game loves you after playing it for a while. I mean, it speaks to you, and it has the right words to do it! The HUD, the main menu and even the pop up messages address you with sort of a tone, or so I think. For example, one time I drove into the service and the game was like ""You know, there's always something you can do to make you feel better about your truck."" or something like that, and I'm like f*ck yeah bro! You addressed me so directly yet so properly that you got me interested! You get a feeling that this game talks to you, that it loves you!My grades have been improving, whenever I have a more stressful day than usual and I don't feel like studying, I hop on this and my stress flies out the window. Plus, this prepares me for the real deal, for real life driving. I'm so glad that they keep updating it and adding DLC's because it's definitely the right thing to do with such an awesome game! It's worth every penny, guys.SIDE NOTE(including what I did not personally find so appealing and what I did): The other drivers. Like, man, if everyone drove the way that the AI drives in this game, there would be a world with civilized and safe roads, but that's exactly the problem! We can't have something so ideal, so unusually precise! Of course we do in the game, but in real life it's way different and I, for one, can't get accustomed. It's like the drivers are stuck to the road and follow a precise set of rules. No need! Make them more sloppy or something, make them more casual. With AI so respectful I feel like I'm the king of the road. Well, okay, honestly no. Not always. They do mess up sometimes and cut me off or overtake me too close, but that's exactly what I want! I lowkey enjoy it when it comes to my reaction time to prevent a crash and to the AI's innocent mistake. It is similar to real life so no need to fix this, it's called a SIMULATOR after all. Make me angry, make me want to get out and smash their windshields with a baseball bat! It's called road rage and it should absolutely not go missing in a simulator game.WHAT I WOULD ADD: -Make it so that you can travel with your drivers, for example make it so that a recruited driver can follow you in their truck and take a trailer from wherever you'd want them to, or simply make it so that you can cruise around with them.-Pedestrians crossing the street: Now, I don't want to turn this into GTA but it would feel more natural to have some people crossing the street at a zebra or something, and if you hit them it'll be like hitting a wall. This would sort of incentivise you to drive responsibly. Like, care not to stop for someone crossing? Well then, here's 25% damage to your truck. Go and repair it and hopefully you'll be more careful next time.-Make it so that you can get out of your truck for example when refuelling or stopping for a rest, make it so that you can roll your windows down to get some fresh air because sometimes it gets heated inside! Make it so that your music is displayed inside your car on some dashboard. Speaking of dashboards, all there is shown is just some basic info about the vehicle, such as oil level, fuel remaining, etc.. Make it more immersive, like you could have a mini TV which only plays while your truck is stationary for safety reasons. If your truck is manual, then do display the shifter and the clutch inside, and speaking of pedals, produce an animation for them, I don't know! Play around, make it so that you can strengthen the bond you have with your truck!			"

												Never been in Norway, so i decide to take a little delivery from Odense to the 1st city in Norway. In Denmark everything as planned, then i have to take the ferry and be more or less at 50 km from the arrival. I take the wrong ferry and find myself in Stavanger, 445km from the destination. Panic. I need 5.10 h to arrive, with 4.30 left.  It's 2 am. I Run at 140 kmh among the fiords like crazy, staying in the middle of the street to be faster. I arrive in the destination city cutting the last roundabout, 3 minutes before expiration. And they say this is a relaxing game! :steamhappy:			"

												The more I play this game the more I fall in love with it...Starting from humble beginnings as a driver taking freelance jobs you will eventually earn enough money to buy your own truck, then the fun really begins(apart from having to pay for your own petrol). Jobs are scattered across the whole of Europe with a variety of XP rewards on offer based on the cargo you will be towing...hook up the trailer, then just drive.As with most simulator games this could be seen as only appealing to a niche section of gamers but Eurotruck 2 really is different, I had no interest in trucks before this game but I was still drawn to it and it has quickly become one of my favourite games. It is essentially a driving simulator but there is a bit of added depth with the ability to build garages and hire other drivers to work for you but for the most part you will be flying down a motorway, watching your speed, watching the traffic, checking that ever so slightly tight bend(cos u will roll if not careful)..Having played many types of games the question of immersion often comes up...not long after first buying this game I was playing one night...Headphones on..Driving down the motorway..Listening to the in game radio(a metal channel) then it began to rain...wipers on ..slow down a bit i'm starting to weave around.. that short time driving down that motorway was the most immersed I've ever been in any game.Special mention should also be given to the Devs..they are constantly releasing updates..listening to player feedback..offering cheap dlc (paint jobs) and periodically releasing larger dlc that opens up new roads and countries and they continue to do this despite working on American Truck Simulator. They also offer the world of trucks website which you can upload your trucking profile to in game and earn achievements and rewards through there ...for christmas they had a challenge to deliver presents over a distance equal to the distance between their offices and the north pole..reward?.. free Dlc..So in summary, Great game..don't be put off by the 'Sim' aspect and support the Devs because they really deserve it and already have one confirmed sale of American Truck Simulator.

												Whenever I feel bored or sad, I just hit up ETS2, get a job with like 2000km distance, tune to 80's hotmix radio(or put on some superior eurobeat) and play for the rest of the afternoon. Never expected it to be so enjoyable to be honest, but it's great at taking stuff off my mind. It's also very comfy to drive on a rainy night with nobody else on the road, and just cruising with high beams. Also the multiplayer's pretty good, though it nearly killed my save so I'm taking a break from it.			"

												This game is fantastic. Some players will think, what a boring piece of... well, think again! If you like a relaxing experience after a hard day of work, right before bed, this is the game for you. Near to zero frustration, anger, high blood pressure. Check the demo! If you like it, get it! I always recommend the game with various mods, to higher the gamingexperience. A musthave for WoS18 addicts!Edit: After all that years and more hours of gameplay, this game is not getting old.The amount of DLCs may be a bit strange for some new-comers. But still, even the paintjobs are well made and worth the money, if you want to support that Company. Not only are they listening at the complains of the users, they also added free content (multible cities and Trucks). They are now working on ATS (American Truck Simulator), but still support ETS2 fully with new patches and content. The modding community is extremly strong and well recieved, which makes the game even better.My point still stands. That game right here is one of a kind. These reviews don't lie. Who ever thought that a ""Trucking Simulator"" can get such a big and supporting fanbase.I didn't.			"

Posted: December 30, 2015
												I have owned this game for quite a while now and I’ve really enjoyed driving for hundreds of hours. I myself am a vehicle fanatic so I love everything that moves on wheels 8). Here are the advantages and disadvantages of the game:Advantages:1.  The game has a huge map which will take you at least 600 hours to explore fully (including both map expansions). The map (including both map expansions) stretches from Great Britain to mainland Europe, then to the very east of Poland and the Nordic region up north. As of December 5th 2016 the 'Vive la France!' DLC completes the remainder of France that was left out in the vanilla map since it's release. It brings an extra 20,000 kms of new roads using HD textures.2. There is a wide range of trucks to choose from. There are high end trucks made for hauling heavy stuff and smaller trucks that get the job done.3. The customization is pretty good too because you can customize almost every aspect of the truck such as tires, engines and cabin trim. You can also apply custom paints and skins to make your truck more unique.4. There is a huge selection of trailers to haul; even if you don’t have the Scandinavia DLC, and the High Power Cargo Pack DLC, you still get a choice to haul pretty much anything that can be transported. It ranges from Tomatoes to Excavators and if you’ve got the Scandinavia DLC, you can haul a pair of Scania or Volvo trucks.5. It’s very realistic; the roads have the correct signs, speed limits are imposed in the correct areas and many things such as white lines, hard shoulders make the driving aspect realistic. The simulation aspect is well met with settings such as physical camera rotation to make it seem like the truck actually seem like it’s moving when you’re in the cabin and realistic fuel simulation. Also real life currencies have been implemented where the main currency is Euros and you’re able to use other currencies such as Pounds sterling or Norwegian Krona. 6. It’s fully modifiable and since it’s release the game has been host to millions of community developed mods such as free map expansions (ProMods & TruckSim Map are great examples), and it literally ranges from everything. There are mods that can change the economy of the game, mods that add trucks, mods that change cabin interiors, mods that add skins. You can really have a blast customizing the game and even making your own mods and publishing them on mod websites like ets2.lt.7. It runs alright on low spec PC's on the lowest settings of course. My PC is terrible and I get about 30 FPS in the cabin on medium settings8. The controls are very simple and it's easy to drive with a keyboard. Gamepads work well too and if you want the full on experience then you should get a racing wheel like a Logitech G27 because it simulates driving and it's more precise.Disadvantages:1.  Updates take a while to come out because the company who develops this game are a very small group meaning that map expansions like Scandinavia DLC that came out 3 years after the base game was released, were demolished by the likes of ProMods, a large group of modders who mapped out a huge part of Scandinavia over a year before the official DLC was even released.2. The cities are extremely brief; let’s take London for example. If the city of London in-game was about the same size as it is in real life, it would take almost every city in the game combined to equal it’s size. This is because each city only has around 4 to 5 roads, a service station, a garage, and a couple of depots.3. (Good and bad) - there’s no multiplayer. This was a problem up until late 2013 when some Polish guys got together and started piecing together a multiplayer mod that would be free to play and would give players an opportunity to transport  loads with each other, organize enormous convoys, and take screenshots. To this day it has over 1,000,000 registered users and as of now it’s growing by about 500 users per day. Overall this game is one of the best driving simulators on the store and it’s a game I’m so addicted to even though I have no interest in trucks. Hope this review helps!			"

												So you want to know what it's like to drive a truck around Europe?This isn't it.You don't get the discomfort. You don't get the stench of sleeping in your cabin for days. You don't get the jaded bored people in logistics handling your delivery. You don't get the pressure of a superior ♥♥♥♥♥ing at you for being late or slow or your cargo being damanged. You don't get the challenge of interacting with people whose language you don't even speak and can't deliver a sentence in English if their grandmother's life depended on it.  You don't get to deal with police pulling you over for speeding, or demolished cars from traffic collisions.You get to have all the fun parts instead (plus some rather irrelevant fines).Euro Truck Simulator gives you a taste of what it's like to drive cargo through Europe without most of the frustrating parts. Sure, you have to deal with local speed limits, and tight lanes, and traffic rules and intersections. That is part of what it means to drive a truck. The game is sandbox-y enough to let you get away with a great deal of driving atrocities without letting you feel like a total traffic god, but it comes close to letting you. The result is that a lot of this game is touring through scenic environments, dealing marginally with traffic rules, with your favourite Internet radio station blasting through your in-game system, and making in-game money through your trucking company in the process. It's not high-paced action. There's no great story involved. Yet the game is irrationally entertaining, managing to somehow find this perfect balance between being engaging and being relaxing, poignantly demonstrating that the goals we set in a game and engage with frequently find their origin in nothing but our own subjectivity, rather than the actual game design.I bought this game on a sale. I never even expected to like it. I was surprised when I did. Had I known I would have paid full price. It's not always relaxing, but it's definitely comfortable. I can launch it up and continue my progress of my trucking empire any time I feel like it, or delay when I don't. I can't rightfully claim to be bored, owning this game.Get out of my way dude, I got a truck and I ain't afraid to pay a fine.			"

												Holy crap this game is awesome. No wonder it won 2 Steam Awards. Great graphics, great gameplay, great concept, what's not to love? It's so realistic, once I almost got stuck in a grassy area and it took me 5 minutes to get out. That's how realistic this game is. Highly recommend. 10/10 5 star game. SCS Haas done it again (Get the joke?).			"

												A (generally) relaxing grind game.  If you like clear set objectives and earning your way to bigger and better things, you'll very likely enjoy this game.My company is big enough now that I can just cruise around and see the sights while my employees earn the big euros for me.  I find it really pleasant to listen to the radio while driving to a place on the map that I've never been to before.  I also REALLY appreciate that the development team constantly adds little tweaks and improvements - for example finally being able to set my own destination on the GPS.One minor, but annoying aspect is the limited number of drivers you can hire.  I know, there are many, many drivers to hire and it may seems pointless to offer any more... But, I've hired every single available driver and there are still lots of cities where I haven't built garages yet.  Point being, I want to hire more drivers, but can't.   Apparently I have single-handedly reduced unemployment for a whole section of Europe.			"

												I had seen my friend Alex play this game and thought: driving a truck in Europe would be very boring. I was very wrong! After I saw you could get a mod of Optimus Prime and his trailer, I had to play this game and a friend Alex gave it to me. I wanted to give the game a shot and it turned out to be a lot more fun than first anticipated. Maybe because one of my favourite series is Ice Road Truckers or because I like big machines.If you want the game to be more realistic try play it with 3D turned on and you will never go back! It makes a huge difference and the 3D works very well. The game is best played with Nvidia's 3D Vision technology.Unfortunately in three real time hours I managed to get four tickets for driving through a red light and no less than four speeding tickets for driving too fast with my truck. He, he, oops! PI really like the way you can tune your truck to look even better and make it more powerful.And not to mention all the mods you can download. I have gotten a lot more respect for the European trucks and I have a lot Scania trucks besides my Peterbilt truck.There is one thing I hate about the game: The piece of crap music in the menu. It sounds really terrible and dull. Some of friends hates the music too o0The AI is not too intelligent either. For example I get fined for another stupid AI card brushing my truck! The brand Iveco gets me angry for some strange reason and I hate it.Try playing this game with Logitech G27 set and it gets a lot more realistic. To top it off, add two additional 3D monitors and you will get an ultimate experience. I haven't played it with three monitors though, but I can imagine how cool it will be.Playing with the mouse and keyboard is challenging and can be a real pain. One day when I have enough money I'm going to have a driving license, not only for cars and motorcycles, but also for busses and trucks. Before I began to like Transformers alot I thought rather negatively about trucks about how slow they were etc. But this game has changed my opinon of trucks and I love to tune my trucks in game, especially by slabbing on some big air horns and a lot of lights, lol. Not to mention a huge roaring and rumbling monstrous engine. <3Tuning a car has never been me and I have tried it in several games, but it doesn't interest me since I hate those cars irl :SEven though I only had a little interest in trucks, now it has affected me a lot and you should try the demo. Give it a shot and I can definitely recommend this game :DI really have changed the way I look at trucks now and I really respects them now.Keep on trucking! (honk, honk!)			"

Traffic can stop randomly on the road (motorways especially) for no reason. Traffic does not give way properly at roundabouts or when entering the depot which can cause huge traffic jams. In the event of an AI crash, the traffic will not reverse unless you hit them to give the AI space.- Collision physics are off. Trailers rubbing of barriers will cause your truck to stop or slow down abruptly. 9.5/10I strongly recommend this for those who like simulation games. "

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a good casual truck driving simulator developed and published by SCS Software. The game was released in January 2013. You, the player, will create a truck driver that can choose from several generic appearance options and you will create your business with a name and logo. The objective of the game is for you to choose contracts to deliver goods and services to various destinations in return for cash. This review will examine Euro Truck Simulator 2's main features in regards to gameplay, environment in respects to performance.ETS2 features entertaining gameplay targeted at casual gamers, as players can play, relax, and listen to music. ETS2 features a job market, split into quick job, freight market, and external contracts. The final category is World of Trucks related; therefore I will not cover it. A quick job is for beginning the game. You choose a job and you drive a business-assigned truck to the destination and in return earn cash. A freight market is for when you purchase a truck and complete jobs to grow your business. Furthermore, once you make money you buy more trucks and hire employees that automatically choose and complete jobs on a time-basis and do earn cash for your business. At the end of each delivery, may it be you or your drivers, all earn experience that increases your levels and grants you skills so you can place into one of six categories, which feature diverse attributes. The game features several brands for trucks and there is an upgrade system that allows you to use money to purchase various upgrades for you and your employee’s trucks including wheels, design, and interior. The entire gameplay process is easy to grasp and it was not difficult for me to learn because it is essentially picking a contract, completing that contract and getting money, and so forth. Furthermore, the game is endless through the objectives of growing your business and learning of all the areas in the game, meaning there is replay potential in ETS2. And, the game does feature a very nice variety of trucks, designs, and customisation. The game features an in-game radio system that allows you to download live radio stations from the Internet. For instance, I was playing and listening to BBC Radio 1, which was live and had Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones in for an interview, so it is a complement to the gameplay. Lastly, the game is very realistic and compares to real-life counterparts through the behaviour of AI drivers and through regulations. The game features speed limits, toll booths, traffic lights, stop signs, basically anything that you see when you drive on so it does add a high level of realism towards the core mechanics of the game. The only negative I have with the gameplay is your truck can only go 90. While this may be realistic, this can be awfully slow when the majority of the game is highways.ETS2 features an excellent map design that alters depending on what location you are at. For instance, Berlin has a different landscape and bigger cities than Torino, Italy. But overall, I found the variety to be plentiful and the overall landscape and environment beautiful and gorgeous. I loved the autobahn's in Germany to the tons of tolls in France to the countryside of Britain. The game complements the great areas by incorporating further detail through weather and night driving. With weather, AI does not change its behaviour, but the only notable difference is drivers have their lights on, but it does not affect their speed. Likewise, night driving is realistic as there are fewer cars driving and there is lights everywhere to illuminate the area. All countries have diverse road designs and it complements the experience.  Performance-related, the game remains consistent in FPS as I was able to maintain a 48-55FPS playing on max settings with minimal drops under 48 and regular increases over 55. I commend the developers for the effort they have in producing a truly beautiful environment and with the diverse weather affects and how it affects the roads. I also commend them with strong optimisation to make sure lower-end PCs play this with ease. My only wish was for bigger cities, but that is probably something we will see in American Truck Simulator.ETS2 has very minor bugs and spelling errors. These are not entirely noticeable, but are present in the game. In saying that, I will not detract from the score because SCS Software have been excellent in providing continued support and update for ETS2, even post-American Truck Simulator release.Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a gorgeous game that is simple, aimed for driving and simulation fans and for casual gamers. It acheieves a very high level of performance, coupled with excellent design and scenery. It has several features and options to spice up the game and maintain simplicity while driving. It is realistic that it matches real-life experiences of road regulations, traffic lights, and even penalties. The game features 35 DLCs with two major expansions, one cabin accessory DLC and the rest being paint jobs. I highly recommend the Euro Truck Simulator 2 + East/North Expansion bundle for USD$29.99 as the game has high replayability.Ratings:Gameplay 8.75/10Environment/Performance: 9.25/10Overall: 9/10Thanks for reading my review!

												Driving trucks around Europe seems pretty boring, right? Wrong.ETS2 has become somewhat of a guilty pleasure for me, being someone who loves driving. The game offers up a solid rendition of a scaled-down version of most of Europe to roam while mastering the skill of hauling tons upon tons of cargo. The game engine is powered by a fairly accurate physics engine and detailed graphics, and achieves an overall feeling of realism that is on par with some of the best. Think of it almost like a ""Free Drive"" racing game, except you have to follow the rules of the road, and trucks provide more of a challenge to drive. There are several real-world trucks with seemingly endless customization options, and a diverse pool of trailers and cargo types to avoid repetition between deliveries. Completing deliveries rewards you with experience points and cash, which both add progression in the form of unlocking new trucks, cargo and customization options, and being able to grow your business by buying more trucks and garages, and by hiring drivers. All in all, ETS2 is a pretty relaxing way to kill some time, and an extremely detailed simulation.

												ETS2 is one of the most relaxing games I've ever played, there's something so chilled and relaxing about trucking long distances where it's just the truck, the road and (for me) the music. I love sitting back with the in game radio on and just driving. The in game radio is an internet radio of sorts and you can connect to real radio stations, there even has been radio stations made and maintained specifically by and for truck simmers. It is a fairly grindy game, but usually for me, a grindy game is an issue when the gameplay gets super repetitive and boring which it has not for me in ETS2. Though keep in mind I do only have around 40 hours logged. Personally I didn't know if I'd enjoy it too much, I've never really been into trucking or anything like that but I was very pleasantly suprised by how much fun I've had with this. If you're doubting your interest, at least give it a go.There is a big map from the get go and coupled with the dlc's it makes for a HUGE map. There are still some portions of the maps which I feel are not very accurate and fairly bland. That being the UK, being from England I get frustrated at driving in the UK in this game because it doesn't feel as authentic as I feel it could. The main concern with the UK driving is the on/off ramps of the motorways. In the UK the motorways are three lanes and have an additional lane created for the on/off ramps, in ETS2 the three lanes split and one of them is used for the on/off ramp. This might be a bit nit picky but it just really annoys me of the lack of authenticity presented in the UK side of the map, something about the merging from the on ramps would feel pretty enjoyable in my opinion. It is very clear from the newest DLC that SCS has improved greatly at making the map and I'd love to see them do some more revisiting of older sections.The developers do indeed still update the game which is very nice to see this is still getting supported even though they've released American Truck Simulator.There is also a very nice modding scene, mods such as ProMods add even more life into the game, adding more countries and improving on some already existing ones, it really makes the game feel a lot better to play. Various mods to add real companies and different trailers are also a must for me.I've seen a lot of people who don't want to play because they don't have a good wheel or whatnot but I've had absolutely no problems with keyboard and mouse, the menus are really well done to allow enough tweaking to make the controls feel comfortable for you.Overall, it's a very relaxing and fun game, the trucks feel fun to drive and it's a simulator done right with a pretty decent management system too. Pros+Relaxing+Good modding scene+Game still supported and updatedCons-Some parts of the map need some work to bring it up to the standard of some other parts of the map.Final score: 8/10 - a must play for anyone.

												I have soon played Euro Truck Simulator 2 for two years and it's the best game I've ever played! I'm close to 1500 hours on record and I'm not sick of it at all! I bought it on sale and I was very sceptic to this game. You can see many real landmarks and you learn to drive! It's many different roads: motor roads, small roads, roads on mountains and in long tunnels! The game is 4 years old so there are some things SCS could updated, for example making Autotolls and many junctions can be confusing. I started delivering one load and thinked that this game wasn't bad at all, and here I am, almost two years later and still love to truck! Don't hesitate to buy this game, it's worth every penny! :)			"

												So this is the most relaxing non-competive driving simulator ever to be created. I wake up turn on my pc, get some food, setup my steering wheel, pedals and gearstick and im trucking for the rest of the day. Totally recommend this game if you just want to relax no stress, no whiny females, just you, your truck and A lot of roads to drive over 👍 Also very usefull when u want to forget about all your problems, you won't notice the SWAT team in your house cause you are trucking, you won't notice that you havent been outside for 5 years. This game is the best game evey made in the history of games.			"

Euro Truck Simulator 2Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game made by SCS Software, a company that has experience with making trucking games, and this game really shows that:The Good:Relaxing, once you boot up the game and start driving around, you just get relaxed.Immersive, on max settings, this games graphics are absolutely stunning, and everything looks very realistic.Fun, it's a lot of fun to drive around and swear at the AI because they've crashed into your truck and you get fined.Realistic, they actually bothered (bovvered) to put a radio in so you can listen to internet radio stations. You might as well buy a real truck by this point.Long, this game takes so long, contrary to other games this game will game you at least 100 hours of game play if you rush through it.Stupid/Realistic AI, the AI behaves like they're real people: Clowns on the road.Low Requirements, you don't need a Gaming PC to run this game.The Mediocre:Sometimes it takes a bit too long to do stuff, and I do recommend only to play when you have some free time on your handsThe Bad:Nothing reallyThe Verdict:Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that proofs that you should never judge a book on its cover. If you hear the name, you'd think that it's dull, but once you start playing it, it just sucks you in and before you now it, it is 3 o' clock in the morning before you have to go to school. "

												just gonna put this here first so people don't need to read it all: I give this game 4 out of 5.coming from games in my youth like, football manager, etc. This game sort of felt like, the more and more I got into it, the more it was a ""manager"" kinda game.Your goals is to obtain garages and trucks, pretty much owning everything, this doesn't fit my definition of a simulator and that might be because I see a simulator being more of a simulation of how it would be to drive around in a truck and do trucker stuff, do not get me wrong this was still good fun as it also reminded me of manager games where I simply just wanted to own everything.that being said, when I bought the game I was expecting a simulator kinda of game but it was not at least it was not for me that is, hence why I wont give it 5 out 5 but 4 out 5 however that doesnt mean I found this game to be bad.Some stuff i did not like:Some lights fx in paris did not work at all, probably was like that in some other cities aswell.(had to wait forever untill I realized I would not get a ticket if I had just crossed it anyway)the ""you are driving in the wrong lane"" ticket ""100 euro"" was also weird because you could alone on the road and no one near you and still get that ticket made no sense to me how anyone would know that.i believe i saw some signs being off like usually at some detours u will get a recommended speed ""dangerous to go faster than 40"" sign but the sign was just a regular dont driver more than 40.the whole map I agree the surroundings were amazing and very nicely done but come on.. the same detours ... the same bridges (i even think I saw at one point a airplane landing on a detour above me..) the whole thing just felt like driving the same path over and over which kinda made me a bit sad because once I did get into the ""manager"" role and where I wanted to have it all, every job just became so tedious because, I had seen it all before, the roads, the detours.. not to mention the ""cities"" themselves.. just looked like a copy paste.my first instinct when I owned my first garage without any debt, was to make the days go faster and to begin with I would just sleep all the time untill it told me I could not sleep anymore.I figured out a way to make the days go really fast and that was to buy another garage and just quick travel back and fourth apparently it cost me 0 money to travel I found that odd because nor did I lose gas or money it and my day went faster so my income got in ""faster"" i am not sure if that is intended but I did that a few times between Liverpool-> Rostock = 100k euro profit over night and then from Rostock -> Liverpool = another 100k euro profit.things I would love to see in ETS3 :- genuine map overall (google maps)- actually cities doesn't need to be detailed I know how much work goes into it but something more decent or at least something that resembles the actual city you are in.- driving license for the truck something like when I was younger I played Gran Turismo back on my ps1 i think and you would had to take driving licenses to the appropriate cars, you coud do the same with the amount of weight you gonna transport not sure how it really works but I guess you get the idea.- actually simulate a truckers life, daily bills, food etc (there were non what so ever besides the ""sleep"")- and keep the manager kinda thing alive it was really fun trying to own every garage in England.NOTE: do not think I only played 13 hours clearly it hasn't counted my offline hours.

												I don't normally play simulator type games, but after hearing nothing but good things about this game I decided to pick it up while it was on sale and give it a go.My conclusion? Yup, it's good. Spend a nice relaxing time driving around Europe listening to random European Heavy Metal radio stations (or whatever genre floats your boat) followed by half an hour figuring out how the hell to reverse park a truck with attached trailer (skippable, but with a bit of practice it becomes fairly easy). Occasionally get a fine in Luxembourg for running a red light (It was yellow I swear!) or speeding in France. Get a loan from the bank and start up a trucking company, because why not?Bonus points for having really good support for nVidia 3D vision out of the box - there are a few issues (skybox too close, stereo mouse cursor sometimes gets stuck at the wrong depth, the odd body of water is renders incorrectly), but nothing severe enough to stop me playing it and throw helix mod at it.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2;As you can tell from the name, it's a simulator. Let's just start this review off by saying, simulators are not for everyone. In Euro Truck Simulator 2 you take the wheel of a tractor trailer across Europe. You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.Pros:-Great Time Passer-Good Graphics-Very Realistic-You Drive All Across Europe-Learn How to Manage Your Own CompanyCons:-There is none, buy this game.Final Verdict:10/10			"

												Its the only one of his kind, SCS has monopolized the licences of trucks so other gaming companies canot make a game like this one.Its a great game even if is one of the most badly optimised ever created. You can`t run this game at 60 fps with more then 200% scaling on a high end pc.I really hope that SCS pays more attention to the feedback of comunity, because SCS will not live forever. And someone else will make a similar game and SCS will die. Its a shame that a company with such a big pedegree and experience in trucking games has made the only game in the world with trucks to be so ugly and bad optimised. It sounds like a negative review but its not, i love the game, i hate the company who made it. I dream the day when Ubisoft or Codemasters or any other company will make a similar game. ETS2 will be just a memory.			"

												I'll keep it short and sweet, if you ever drove 18 wheelers or just like trucks you'll love this sim! Personally I'm waiting on the new SCS American Truck Sim to drop! You do need to fine tune your controls and steering but other than that I love it. And the free private ad-on mods sometimes take the sim to a whole new level!			"

												Ive been playing truck games since hte early versions of 18WOS and as a kid, that series was brilliant. But the advances in programming technology, SCS have done a fantastic job with ETS2! As a single player simulator, the game offers a challenge to build up your company, hire drivers and buy trucks, putting you in the management seat as well as th driving seat. With the addition of the multiplayer mod, the game was bought to life and has since exploded in popularity in my opinion. ETS2MP bought the world of virtual truckers together, enjoying the game together, driving in convoys, working for virtual trucking companies and generally having even more fun than single player!!Overall, the game on its own is fantastic, but with the addition of official DLC's it is becoming an incredibly immersive environment, and some of the mods you can download really make the experience unique to the player. Ive truly not seen a better truck simulator than Euro Truck Simulator 2.But dont take my word for it, my hours are good, but i know a few people with 500+ hours on the game!! Creating an experience that good is most certainly something for SCS to be proud of.Now, no game review is complete without pointing out some of the bad points. ETS2 itself has been out for a while and technology has advanced greatly since its initial release, therefore the physics engine could be improved. eg. why not have the road become slightly slippy when its wet during/after rain? However, I know that SCS are working on improving various elements of the sim whilest creating new exciting DLS's at the same time. The ETS2MP Mod (the most popular unofficial mod) shares similar downfalls as many other mass multiplayer games (Call of Duty, Battlefield, GTA Series) whereas the servers become filled with people just wanting to ruin your day by not playing the game properly. It was suggested by an ETS2MP admin that new players should be made to ""take a driving test"" before being able to play on hte main ETS2MP servers, however I dont think this will take off.I hope this review is helpful, I truly think SCS will one day create something better than their capabilities, but that hasnt, and wont happen with ETS2. WELL DONE SCS SOFTWARE!!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game with long lasting fun. Great handling models for each truck, great community, and great DLCs. The base game includes the UK, part of France, part of Italy, Belgium, Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Germany, part of Poland, part of Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland. Expansion packs (as of 7/5/2016) are Scandinavia and Going East. Scandinavia has Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. Going East has countries like Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.There are a lot of licensed trucks with 2 models per company. (Renault, MAN, DAF, Scania, Volvo and Mercedes) A lot of truck custimization, from paint job to light systems. You work your way up the World of Trucks, starting with little money and no trucks. You do quick jobs until you can take a loan from the bank and buy a truck, or you can do a lot more and buy one without a load. As you level up, you can choose where to invest your training in. ADR, Long Distance, High Value, Fragile, Just In Time and Eco Driving. If you have enough money, you can expand your garage and buy more trucks, you can also buy other garages all over Europe. You can buy trucks for your employees and they will make money for you. The game is constantly in development, the Vive La France DLC has been anounced and will have the rest of France. They also keep adding Flag Paint Job DLCs (currently are about 19 countries (7/5/2016)). You should buy this game, it is worth it!			"

												Quite possibly the greatest simulator ever made.With its smooth gameplay, eye-watering graphics and a vast amount of vehicles available vanilla, you can be assured that your first drive in this game will be an unforgettable one.Then there's the mod community. It has to be one of the biggest out there. There are many sites out there where you can download extra content for this game. There's so much of it out there, you'll probably need to rent out Google's servers for a day just to hold them all.If you get this, I highly recommend you get the Multiplayer mod for this. It's that great, it won Mod of the Year 2014. You can meet other people who share the same interests as you and take a drive together. If showing off is your thing, you can enter a truckfest or drive in a convoy of your choice using the dedicated convoy sites. You even have the chance to drive a highly detailed car, which you can use for either piloting a convoy or just as an ordinary civilian vehicle.Overall, this gets a 10/10 from me. And for as low as £3 during a sale, you can never go wrong. It's essentially a steal.			"

All this ties well with the TruckersMP mod which allows for you to play online with friends and join the bigger community.			"

I ended up finding this game on YouTube, and after seeing some gameplay, I instantly bought it.Also, the company who have made this game, SCS Software, are absolutely amazing. They are constantly updating this game, fixing bugs, making DLCs...			"

SummaryIf you're a truck fan, this is the best that you can get. There is no real reason to look for any other truck sim at the time, and you'd spend your money better buying Euro Truck Sim's DLCs. Better yet, get Promods mod pack for the game and enjoy a vastly improved map with a lot of new countries, cities, and almost never ending new roads.Pros1. Great selection of main trucks on the market, each very detailed and with many ways to customize.2. A pretty large map which can get really huge with Promods. 3. Many different cargo types to choose from, available in many national liveries.4. Steam Workshop support with a huge amount of great mods from new liveries and vehicles to physics and graphics overhauls. 5. Very nice graphics and an in-game screenshot maker that allows you to edit many different things such as field of view, blur, and colors on the spot. Even though this game is not new, I think it aged pretty well.6. A lot of different paintjobs for your trucks, if that's your cup of tea - note that you will need DLCs for most of them.7. Driving seems quite realistic, although requires a decent steering wheel and some adjustments.8. Game is very stable and bugs are very rare.9. Fleet management and ability to build your very own company is a prety nice addition. 10. Levelling and unlocking different abilities that allow you to burn less fuel or transport certain kinds of goods - such as toxic, flammable, explosive etc.11. Community is very vibrant and friendly.Cons1. Too many buildings are just copy-pastes, especially warehouses where you pick up and deliver goods.			"

												It may sound silly, but this is one of the most compelling games I've played in the past several years. It's fun, it's gorgeous, it's engaging and it's very well made, with an active community and a proactive developer who continuously patches the thing. This is the game that finally convinced me to get a 360 gamepad, and that alone was worth it, but the game itself is just fun, and relaxing too. One of my favorite moments was driving through Germany listening to a French radio station when ""Blame it on the Boogie"" by the Jackson 5 came on. I'd never heard the song before, but loved it, and the mix of that song, the open road and the lovely graphics were just incredible. Totally worth your time, this game is.			"

												Back when I had first discovered ETS2, I played the demo for hours upon hours. Starting one profile after another. Once the Multiplayer Mod was released, a friend of mine decided it might be time to actually purchase the game and see all it really has to offer. Now, I've been playing ETS2 since roughly November 2013. But I hadn't actually had it on Steam up until March or April. I've been involved with the Multiplayer community from day one, and have put over 400 hours into multiplayer alone. But, that isn't really the topic of discussion.So, I estimate I've put in about 200 single player hours (90% of which was off the record) and I've got to say, if you enjoy simple, relaxing, and generally stress-free gaming, ETS2 is certainly for you. I can't tell you how much fun I have going from one end of the map to the other, avoiding the sometimes clumsy Artificial Intellegence cars. I've played around with the Vanilla version, Mods, all the while rounding some of the trickiest turns and windiest roads between Erfurt and Milano. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. It can take roughly two hours to get from one end of the map to another with the speed limiter on. Not to mention it's still being updated. Not too many games that were made even six months ago continue to add on more content, or even just fix little problems or exploits. I have to give it to SCS on this one. This game is their baby, undoubtably the best game they've ever made. And they treat it as such. Not to mention the Community. The ETS2 Community is very fond of SCS. And that is for one simple reason: They listen. SCS listens to the suggestions given to them from within the Community, Unlike most big companies, (Not gonna name any names here... *Cough* EA *Cough*) which seem to only care about the game and it's Community for a short time. While SCS has continued to progress the developement of this game and it's Community. And believe me, guys and girls. We, the Community, notice and appreciate your efforts. So, on behalf of the entire ETS2 Community, I'd like to say Thank you.The amount of DLC for this game is quite substantial. With the new Cargo Pack update, and a potential Rigid trucks update coming out (Nothing official, just being considered) this is shaping up to be one hell of an amazing game. SCS, you're going places, and I'll be right here when you get there. I've been playing trucking games since the days of Hard Truck one, so I know what it takes, and what people generally want. And I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. And I know ATS is going to be flatout incredible. Happy Trails, SCS. Keep in mind, comparing this game to current gen games is not what I intend to do. It's being rated based on it's release date, and it's updates since then.Physics: 7/10.Truck model detail: 10/10.Map size: 10/10.Texture detail: 9/10 (For it's time and what it is)Menu layout: 10/10. It's super easy to use, and rather user friendly for new players.Immersive aspect: 10/10. I can't tell you how many times I've started playing, and forgot I was playing a game for a bit. It's really easy to lose yourself in this game with some good music and a Radio Play or two.Overall, I have to give this game a 9.8/10. It's fantastic, and certainly worth the money.			"

So what are you waiting for jump in start your engine and head out on the open road. :)			"

												I'm a truck driver in real life. This is the best Truck Simulator I've seen. Now if the developers could add some bridges and other obstacles too low or narrow for the trucks to pass, narrower, twisty and bumpy roads with heavy climbs and slippery surfaces, snowchains, risk of flat tires, destinations which are extremely hard to locate, deliveries fitted with the wrong address, more paperwork, dirt and carwash, and the risk of delivering the wrong goods or wrong amount at the wrong place this would be an even better simulation of a trucker's everyday life. But seriously, this is THE truck driving simulator. If you ever wanted to see what it feels like driving a truck around, this is probably as close as you can get without actually doing it. However, a major difference between this game and driving a truck around in real life is the level of comfort and relaxation. Driving a truck in real life will make you tense, whereas this game is weirdly relaxing. The sim is good looking and well made. I never regret for a second spending a few bucks on this game.			"

Product received for free
												Recommended: Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a really good, entertaining, enjoyable & decent game to play. There are a range of loads of which you can transport to it's destination. However there are DLC Maps and Paint Jobs etc to improve your gameplay... There is also a Multiplayer Mod to add to your enjoyment out of Euro Truck Simulator 2. Euro Truck Simulator 1 had some good graphics however Euro Truck Simulator 2 has improved these much further. There are a range or trucks which you can select from to deliver your load. You can even start your own business with drivers you hire. Overall it is a great game for all who like driving and trucking :)   (Multiplayer is a mod which you can get from Truckers.MP.com) "

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is all about living the dream that is professional trucking. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is too serious. The game even tells you as you begin that this is your dream job. With more than enthusiasm, players begin their adventure humbly with a little garage in the home city of their choice, and a company with no trucks.The player begins by taking jobs for other companies, earning money from one city to another, with an eye toward earning enough cash and purchasing a truck. An owned truck means more freedom, with higher paying jobs that require more responsibility. When working directly for the player company, cargo is waiting at a select shipping yard and must be hitched to the truck before it can be taken to its ultimate destination. The next step from there is to start upgrading the garage, hiring other drivers to bring in more income, and eventually building a trucking empire that spans all of Europe.The more you go, the more there is to do. Want to expand quickly? You can take out loans that need to be repaid. Want specialized drivers? They each level up the same way you do, and you can dictate the way they do. Of course, you also have to be mindful of expenses, be they repayments to the bank or fuel consumption by employees looking for work. There are a lot of ducks to get in a row, but the interface is user-friendly and information is constantly provided so nothing ever feels hopeless.More than a game about driving, Euro Truck Simulator 2 boasts some role playing elements to keep things interesting. Successful jobs earn experience, which gives skill points. Skill points can be spent upgrading one's proficiency in certain types of jobs, unlocking new types of cargo, or even investing in fuel efficiency. Improving personal abilities and building a business from one lone driver to an entire fleet.Driving trucks is as realistic as possible. Offering a huge map of Europe, there's plenty of time to be spent on the open road, and lots of distance to cover. Although you won't be undertaking journeys in real-time, a decent paying job is still quite the investment. I often found myself able to only play one job at a time.There are a variety of controls and settings allowing for significant flexibility in terms of personal comfort. You can choose how complex your controls are, with automatic settings keyboard and set up a wheel. Whatever your available input, Euro Truck do a great job of covering you and ensuring you get into the game easily.A tutorial guides for newcomers, and the essential GPS is easy to understand, as is its clear and simple route map. My first job was a decided disaster, with me getting the trailer stuck a number of times, managing to tip the vehicle over, and even call for emergency rescue. Traffic lights, speed cameras, and the ever-present need to keep one's eyes on the road can always trip up an overconfident player, and as relaxing as long country drives may be, the pressure to avoid mistakes is present throughout. It's very easy to start getting speeding along a motorway without regard to other drivers and strict speed limits. Every mistake translates into a financial penalty, damaged cargo reduces the payday, and suffered by an owned truck will have to be paid for at service stations.When a mistake occurs, it's almost always our fault, but there are some moments where the computer controlled road users face an issue. But they're few and far between, and experienced drivers will be able to avoid many of the hazard that lead to such trouble. Despite the occasional pressure to perform jobs well, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is still a largely cleansing experience. There's a driving through a variety of countries, a sense of joy as you get closer to your destination, and a sense of accomplishment in performing such boring tasks as refueling at gas stations and finding parking stops at which to grab some sleep. As you build your business up from nothing and take on more of managerial duties, it's hard not to feel pride over rewards well earned.Although most visually advanced game, Euro Truck's believable presentation of Europe's roads and cities and atmosphere of the backdrops, there's a sense of individuality to each new territory you uncover, and the trucks themselves are lovingly recreated with an intricate level of detail. Owned trucks can be repainted and upgraded with all manner of parts, and as the player levels up, the potential for personalization expands.The most fun aspect of Euro Truck Simulator 2, however, comes in the form of its music. With the simple tap of the ""R"" key, you can open up a menu packed with European Internet radio streams as well as your own Music and Radio streams. Providing a wide variety to listen. There's also the option to queue up music from one's own PC.Conclusion:Very realistic and very fun to play good gameGreat GraphicsLarge map, (With Going East and upcoming Scandinavia DLCs.t's a very relaxing game It’s very easy and to listen to music, podcasts or the radio.Customization options for trucksLots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargoReal truck manufacturers with Different truck designs.Photo mode with different options allowing you to take nice shots of your trucks.World of Trucks Achievements and Events from the developers to unlock new contents through world of trucks                             website.Seat, lights and mirror adjustment, lights are all customizable.Different cargo types, especially with the High Power pack and some of the skills you can unlockDifferent skills to unlock new cargos.Customizable ControlsPlenty of great mods and it's very easy to install modsGame customizable with mods and it's very easy to install mods.Extra paint job packs in high quality.High Quality sceneryRating:10 of 10 "

												I hate driving games and I hate driving even more in IRL. I saw someone playing it and I couldn't understand for the life of me why anyone would want to play something that sounded so boring. Then I tried it for myself, it seemed... nice... watching the beautiful scenery roll by while you're driving and listening to music is very relaxing.19 hours (in 1.5 days) later, I think I'm addicted to it and can't stop playing, I'm not even sure why. I have already thought about quitting my day job and just be a full time virtual truck driver.			"

												After having over 1000 hours of gameplay I can safely say this is my most favourite PC game of all time with its stunning gameplay and also the fact it's great to play and chill out while driving through excellent scenery. I love the fact that after 4 years this game is still as actively played due to developers releasing updates quite often with improvements to the game via free updates and also paid DLC, before you start I know alot of games try and cash cow the DLC system but for the amount of work the small team at SCS put into the DLC and the small amount they request you to pay it's excellent and I thank SCS for their hardwork and commitment in this game.The game is also very largely supported by the community that offer various mods that range from additional Trucks (Scania 143) to Trailers and cab accessories (Inside & Out) and also map mods.If you have read this far I believe this game should already have been added into your cart or already been bought :)Please feel free to check my profile for screenshots from the game.

												The best thing about this game is the experience. I have not spent a lot of time in Europe, but I feel like I have after driving from Scotland to Hungary. You've probably read all the other reviews here and in publications talk about the experience of just slipping into some kind of ""groove"". You will be cruising down the autobahn with a load of potatoes at 3:00 AM with the radio on to some Dutch station and just lose yourself in that moment, almost as if you can roll down the window and feel the wind blow in. Those moments create immersion in a way few games can and this game will creep up on you with them. When you do make it to Milan with those potatoes you will feel like you've accomplished something.The experience is the best part about this game, and while it's great I find myself wishing that the whole ""company management"" aspect of this game was done just a bit better. It has the bare bones there, you buy trucks, hire guys, buy garages, make money, but I wish it had more depth and strategy than it does. There's enough there to make you care about hitting the road with that load of tractors or upgrading your engine, but it's not quite what it could be to make this a truly killer game.But what is here, those ""on the road moments"", is worth it.

												Driving semi-trucks in Europe? That's gotta suck, right? How wrong you are! This game is terrific. The game starts out like a road-bound big rig version of Elite or Privateer. Haul loads from place to place earn money. Simple. After awhile, you'll buy your own truck. Now you're invested in following the rules of the road because tickets add up. Gas costs money. Once you've mastered the life of a solo tucker, the game really opens up. Now you get to manage a company, hire and fire truckers, set jobs for them, and do your own trucking. Highway bliss!			"

												“With its stellar gameplay and presentation, Euro Truck Simulator 2 set a new standard for the simulation genre.” -  Gaming Nexus [www.gamingnexus.com] Better than  Euro Truck Simulator  Worse than Actually driving a truck with your own business in which you travel around Europe. TL:DR Driving games have never really been my thing in the past. The only reason I bought this was because one of my friends was nagging me to buy it. When I first played it, my first hour was literally crashing everywhere trying to adapt to the controls. But the more I played it, the more I loved it. You can own your own buisness and travel around a huge chunk of Europe. Definitely a must buy! Give it a chance, it's worth it. NOTE: All of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.  About Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the 2nd game of the Euro Truck franchise. You drive around Europe, completing deliveries and earning money to manage your own company. You can hire drivers to work for you by also completing deliveries around Europe. You can buy your own truck and design it in anyway you choose. Make your dream come true...... but in a video game.  Gameplay The gameplay is pretty simple if you've played simulation games beforehand. There are different modes for controls so for newcomers it shouldn't be too hard to adapt. Once you're used to handling your truck, it can be pretty relaxing. The game has tons of real-life radio stations for you tune in to. Your truck pretty much has things a real life truck would have, such has headlights, indicators and a horn. It even has steering wheel controller compatibility. There are 8 different camera views, so you can drive your truck at different angles. An almost basic style gameplay (Unless you go for the more advanced modes). Design/Graphics You don't need a super powerful PC to run the graphics at a high level. The developers have done a great job at detailing environments as best as they can. Some locations are beautiful to drive through, where as others are a bit plain and simple. The graphics aren't the best I've seen, but they're good enough to show a beauty element to it. The graphics settings are easy to navigate, should you need to change them. UI [User Interface]  When looking at some of the screenshots, I can see some people being a bit overwhelmed if they haven't played many simulation games before, but as I said before, you easily adapt. As long as you know the controls, you don't need to worry about all the things you see around your steering wheel. Managing your company can be confusing at first, but the more you play, the more you get used to it. Pros - Very realistic- Huge world to explore- Beautiful environments- Different driving styles- Real-life radio stations to listen and relax to. :) Cons  - Some parts of the road make no sense. E.G. Roundabouts. - Can be confusing for people new to simulator games.- Some environments can be plain and/or repetitive. Final Recommendation As many people have said, this game is more of an experience. You don't have to like simulators to like this. You don't have to live driving games to like this. If I ever want to play a relaxing game, this would be the game I'd choose most of the time. It provides many hours of enjoyment, with plenty of things to do. I would definitely give this game a go! Final Verdict - 9/10.

												I have bought ETS2 through another site, so my playtime is not accurate. This will be a review from my own perspective. My opinion is not a subject to approval. In this review, I will use 10 different categories, each having 10 points. At the end of the review, I will sum these points up.GameplayIn Euro Truck Simulator 2, you control a truck driver, who slowly climbs up the career path and eventually runs a huge company, OR goes bankrupt in the process. You can customize your truck, give your driver a name, and so on. Anything you would want to customize in a truck simulator, is there. The game is very fun and playable in general. It's a great game if you want to relax after or before work/school. You can also level up in various fields!Gameplay score - 10/10SoundThe game features very realistic truck sounds, and I have no complaints about those. You can hear the rain, thunderstorm, etc. But the biggest flaw I noticed is that I don't hear the AI cars/trucks passing by. It might be a problem with either my sound card or settings, but if I am wrong, I will update my review when I figure out how it really is.Sound score - 9/10GraphicsAs a game developer myself, I do understand that if the point of the game is functionality, then of course graphics must be put to second, or latter place. Therefore, the graphics and animations for ETS2 are as good as they should be for a truck simulator. I'd really give 11 points here if it only was not against my rules!Graphics score - 10/10DifficultyMy first hours were of course quite difficult to understand the controls. But what helped the the most are the manual and the online ETS2 guide. Thanks to those, I learned the controls and how to play this game really quickly. The developers put their thought into this and for that, I salute them. I don't remember if there was a tutorial, I think there was... I'll check when I get back home.Difficulty score - 10/10VarietyThere is a huge variety of landscape, trucks, A.I. cars/trucks, buildings, and everything I would expect this game to have. There are lots of upgrades to choose from. The developers did a great job on that part. The only bad thing which stands out to me the most is probably the people walking on the streets of the cities. Yeah. There are none. But hey, it's a driving game, and maybe the developers decided not to include pedestrians in order to either optimize the game, or invest more time on more important things like trucks/landscape.Variety score - 9.5/10OriginalityI haven't really played any other truck simulators in the past, so I'll just put a full 10 here. Originality score - 10/10EconomyThe economic/business management part of this game, however could be improved much more. There's really not much you can micromanage. You can't negotiate with your employees about salary, you can't promote them(only level  them up). You can't enter how much you really want to take from the bank. There are no competitors, even if you see the actual A.I. trucks driving on the road. However, the economic part of the game is still playable, I'm not saying it's not. It's just that tycoon-maniacs like me might find this as a huge flaw.Economy score - 5/10A.I.The AI in this game is really well developed. It, however,  still behaves strangely sometimes - the cars sometimes don't follow the road rules, sometimes they glitch out. But overall, the AI just about right.A.I. score - 8/10ControlsLike i stated before, the controls are well-accessible, and are easly to learn and customize. You can even use a wheel with pedals, pretty much what all driving games offer, right? Perfect controls.Controls score - 10/10Price vs. QualityThe game is 20 euros. It is too low. Should be 40, or 50! Buy it before it raises! You will not regret it!Price vs. Quality score - 10/10OverallOverall score - 91.5/100 "

The multiplayer mod makes this a blast to play with friends and besides, Who doesn't want to travel over Europe with friends, its even better with the going east DLC since you can explore even more of Poland and i really can't wait for the Scandinavian update :)This became my addiction for a short while but now i have no one to play it with.Would deliver loads of cargo across Europe again, I r8 10/10UPDATE : Can deliver crap and♥♥♥♥♥♥10/10 - IGN			"

												I simply got hooked on this game, big time.  This is one of those games that isn't fun, yet it's still entertaining.  Maybe, it's because it's kind of relaxing, just driving a big truck along European highways at night, with nothing to worry about except getting to Point B except offcourse obeying the traffic rules and knowing what your side of the road you are on specially in the UK.  I like also dig the concept of starting out your company from scratch and make it successful.  In addittion, you can pretend travelling through Europe and enjoying the amazing landscapes.  The single and probably the main reason this game is so appealing to me is the fact that I can listen to my own music playlist or watch a youtube clip  and still play it.  I like that in games.  Sometimes, I pause for a while and read news articles online then come back and play. The graphics are decent, and the gameplay has enough variety to keep you going for a while, with many different European and UK cities.  And the developers are great, offering expansions and DLCs to an already great game.I would definitely recommend for people who enjoy simulators because this one is pretty good.  I haven't tried the multiplayer mod yet.  I read somewhere that there are only a couple of servers available (US and UK) with very strict gameplay rules. All in all, it has been a very immersive and interesting experience and I give a score of 8/10.			"

												yes i highly recommend this game. Honestly I wasn't too keen on a game for driving trucks , then a friend gave me it and I'm glad i got to play it. For starters , i wasnt successful on my first save , which some may find too, but it gets so addicting when you get into the game past your first truck . Pros , offers a very realistic experience , including trucks and roads that fell as if you could get into any volvo truck in real life and drive accross europe on your knowlegde from the game , propably stall the truck but thats besides the point! Offers many choices in technique , personally i chose manual gear box (shift up and down gears ) and mouse steering for a realistic enough feel , i would recommend that settings. Graphics are jaw dropping on ultra and excellent on good . Cons. At the start it was so boring , and if you dont think you will ever have a love for driving or trucks or business simulation , be best stay away , but i would give it a chance. 2, Ultra realistic , if you crash too much it could cause you to go so much in debt that you might just reset your game save . 3,Unrealistic ai , sometimes the ai can be stupid , like would someone ram you in the side at a T junction , probably . To sum it up short , great game , very realistic , can be boring , but rewarding , and be sure to stay within those speed limits ( only if you see the speed cam sign)			"

												Even though driving around MAY get boring after a while, this game has to be one of the most immersive driving games I have ever played.Content-wise, the game's not dissapointing either. You don't get too many trucks BUT you get plenty of variety when it comes to customizing. The map is pretty big and you can easily expand it with modifications (I DO recomment ProMods, their map expansion is like, REALLY polished and REALLY huge). If you get to add your favourite playlist or an online radio station, you'll love this game for sure.Oh, and, thanks to this game I started looking at mirrors when turning or changing lanes in the other games. Nothing's better than a game which builds good habits!			"

												This game is suprisingly good for a simulation. Could the graphics be better? Yes. The cabs are highly detailed though with working gauges and lights. Outside scenery is a little lacking then you come across something that blows you away. A boat in the harbor, a lighthouse, an old manor. Could the AI drivers be less annoying? Yes but then it would loose some of it's charm.Picking the right loads and delivering them on time without racking up a ton of fines/damage is a real challange. Going from left hand drive to right hand drive countries will keep you on your toes.Being able to stream European radio is a huge plus to the immersion and really interesting. Tons of stations to choose from. Want to stream your own music? Go ahead the Dev's included a way to do that as well.Overall good game for those that like trucks and trucking.			"

												Ever since I purchased Euro Truck Simulator 2 it has been one of my all time favourite games, with myself playing over 75 hours, all of which helped be grow and expand my company. Although the game never ends, once you are earning more money than you could ever need, and you don't really know what to do next.The Performance of this game is incredible! I could run smoothly on my old laptop on medium settings and on my desktop I play on elevated high settings smoothly. The graphics are very realistic in high settings but sometimes out of place. Most motorways in the UK in the game look the same but none the less the experience in terms of graphics is amazingly realistic. Definitely see the performance for youself and do youself a favour and download the demo!When I first purchased the game I owned a Thrustmaster 458 italia racing wheel, which as the market goes is near the bottom. The wheel worked with the games like Insane 2 very well, but for Euro Truck Simulator 2, since it only had a 90 degree turning radius in each direction the sensetivity was insanely high. I changed the controller imput from 'wheel' to 'gamepad' and the sensetivity issue was fixed, but nothing felt real, as when holding the wheel still in real life, the wheel kept turing in the game, it took getting used to and did work but I didn't really like it and it caused coutless MVAs.Once I was hooked properly on the game I invested in a Logitech G920 racing wheel which has a 900 degrees turning radius. All my problems were fixed, the driving force shifter felt realistic and worked perfectly, the amount I turned the wheel in real life was mirrored in the game.The scenery in the game is very good and HD but is out of places in a lot of the game, my fix for this is to either go with a scenery mod like ProMods, which is a bit of a hassle to get working or try the Scandinavia expansion. I bought the expansion and it looked really good, I've never been to Scandinavia but I got a feel for the place, it looked really good and was definitely woth buying. Going East came with my version of the game, but didn't really click with me, the east side of the map felt just like the rest of it but the price reflects that I think.I would recommend both Going East and definitely the Scandinavia expansion if you love to drive, but if you just want to mess around and are casual, don't bother.As I got more into Euro Truck Simulator 2 I starting looking for ways to improve my experience, origionally I looked towards VR and the oculus rift which the game is compatible with, but the price put me off so I instead bought Track IR 5 with the standard head clip. The clip worked and fits onto any hat, and meant I could look around the environment as if I was in it. Although expensive, really cool and awesome.One of the things that I love about Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the endless posibilities with customization of trucks, you can change everything... literally everything, the wheels, tyres, exausts, sun visors, interior trim, and loads more! There are endless posibilites and having played lots of the Truckers multiplayer have never seen anyone with a truck like mine.One thing missing from the game I think is some realistic damage to the environment and your truck, which never happens, everything is clean and un-dented. Hopefully SCS can think about that one. Overall Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a brilliant game, very much woth the money and heaps of fun to play if you are serious or want to mess around. I recomend this game to anyone with interested in driving games as it is in my oppinion the most realistic driving simulation on the market. There are plenty of mods to have fun with so is perfect for any player,Thanks for reading and happy trucking,~Panini			"

												This game was sitting in my library for a year already, but never got around to play it. Now that I am playing though I can't stop playing, it's pretty addictive to drive and build up your company! Is this game a simulation? Yes and no. Yes overall it is a (driving) simulation, but in the finer details it is not so much. Specially the whole road network and traffic is not quite real and a bit to generic. I wont go into all the details, but the road network is not like that in real life in Europe (and specially not the same for every country). How the highway ramps/exits are designed and how just one lane can be used to not take the exit I have never seen in Europe. Even though it's not that realistic, it is not something to get annoyed about, it is what it is and it works. As for the environment, that too (so far as i've explored it) is kind of generic (though nice looking), I don't really notice much difference between countries. When I am driving in Germany it could just as well been Poland or Slovakia or something. Some countries do have some unique buildings and scenery. The Netherland has windmills next to the road so you recognise that easily. However The Netherlands apparently also has hills, something I have never seen, and I am a Dutchie. And Austria and Switzerland does not have the Alpes mountains anymore. Those countries in real life have some great (tricky for truck drivers) mountain passes, but they are not there in the game. Mountains only exist as distant scenery, all the driving is done on hills at most. Overall the game has a bit to much copy/paste scenery/buildings/roads making more or less every country you drive through feel the same due to the same roads and what you see next to the roads. It would of course have been time intensive and costly for the devs to create unique buidings and environments for every country, but now it feels a bit to lazy. Even the vegetation and trees is exactly the same everywhere, there are maybe 4 or 5 different tees types on the whole map, grass and flowers are the same in whole Europe.I have never driven a truck so I can't really tell how realistic it is, besides I am playing with a controller and not with a wheel. The handling and phisics does feel nice and it really gives the feeling you are driving with a 10 ton trailer behind you.Controls (controller) has a pretty aweful default setup and the game does not 100% support an Xbox controller. Not every button on your controller can be used to bind functions to so you are stuck with limited controls, however the most important things can be used with the controller.Camera. It's great you can look around in your cockpit and look at both mirrors, but while driving I can't really use the camera, because I don't have a 3rd hand I can use. Playing with a controller you can setup one of the joysticks for the camera, but then you will have to setup the other joystick for both steering and braking/accellerate which results in unplayable driving. So in practice in the truck I always have the camera straight ahead and totally rely on the mirrors. Now I don't see much of the nice scenery though as I can't smoothly look left/right. Graphics in general is nice. I think they made a good compromise between quality and performance. The truck models look really great and high poly and the overall cars (traffic) look pretty good too. I especially love the sky and clouds in this game, it really looks nice when you drive into the morning sun and see those nice clouds. As for buildings and general terrain and scenery, it's nice, but not wow or anything.Conclusion: This is a really fun and addictive driving game/simulation that is suited for a very wide audience. I think almost anyone can have fun with this game/sim if you like driving. The game/sim can be set up to be played as an easy arcade suited for any age, but you can also ephatize the simulation aspect and make it more challenging. This game is a nice getaway from all the competitive games. It's very relaxing to just drive from A to B and meanwhile enjoy the scenery and the sun shining through the window while listening to some music. Dispite the few critical/negative notes I made I think this is a pretty solid game that I will at least sink a 100 hours into.Verdict: 80/100 "

												I never knew what country music is, knows nothing about trucks, after playing this game for 5 hours straight last week, oh boy, I wished I knew about this game sooner. Nothing beats the feeling driving the truck in 90 km/h while listening to those country music. Got 3000 euros fine the first time I did my delivery, not familiar with the traffic rules in Europe, but you can always reload.Driving is the core of this game, its relaxing and addictive at the same time. The graphic is breath taking, the musics are good, and the driving mechanic is based on reality, which makes it very comple. And god, those trucks are awesome as ♥♥♥♥, and you can upgrade your trucks from the tires, body, dashboard (incl. accessories), engine, suspensions, paintjobs, basically everything. Every delivery you complete will net you some exp, money and skill point. After you has some dough, you can hire new drivers, trucks and garages.The map is big enough (without the dlcs), IMO. It takes time to discover every roads to 100%. If you want a relaxing game with no pressure, try this one.			"

												If you are feeling like going for a drive, but someone has stolen your car (again), why not just pop on 'Euro Truck Simulator 2?' For a nice, lazy sunday afternoon trek to various european destinations via abridged 'real world' locations, you can smash your way through traffic at high speeds of 45mph, with not a policeman in sight. This is the lethargic man's Grand Theft Auto. No need to get out of your rig to beatdown an old lady for chump change here. Just sit back and enjoy the scenery, and even take a nap at the steering wheel if you feel like doing so. When you wake up, you might be in Rotterdam, surrounded by mountainous vistas, with peaks as high as 3 feet. And if you have a good while to spare, you can attempt to park at your destination. Your clothes will be out of fashion by the time you do so, and you will be eligible for a bus pass, but it's all part of the Euro Truck 2 journey. Three thumbs up!			"

												Driving a semi around Europe doesn't sound all that fun, but unlike most simulators where the fun is further depressed by terrible gameplay, SCS Software has created a masterpiece. There is a lot of long drives for sure, but as the modding community comes alive there are new and larger challenges around every corner. The graphics are excellent, the trucks feel right, and when you mess up and hit the wall you pay for it. These aren't race cars and driving them as such will only come out of your pocket.The added ability to hire drivers and build a trucking empire, while it still sounds tedious, is not nearly as boring as it sounds. The more you grow your company the more you can goof off and risk that speeding fine, car crash, or other poor decision.All in all Euro Truck Simulator 2 is worth a look by all gamers. Sit back, turn on the radio (which links to streaming radio stations from Europe), and drive!			"

												Well, I wasn't excepting a simulator game will be that entertaining. This is a good game with nice graphisms and a big-enough variety of trucks. The specialization system is great, just like the employees system. However, the damages and the penaliy system are very strict because of the fact that you don't have a license system. Sometimes, you'll be at 90KM/H on the highway and a random car just made a tiny bump into your trailer and then it says ""Damages : -400€ and 2% damages to the trailer that contain fragile shipment lawl"". In this situation, you'll be like ""I'll crush your tiny car with my bare hands, u piece of trash!"". But sometimes, this kind of situation can make you laugh. However I am still wondering why I only have 45 FPS and 60°C on my GPU during driving and more than 900 FPS and 80°C on my GPU when I am on the menu.→ 85/100			"

												Everyone might make fun of you for playing it but it is a very enjoyable, relaxing game. You lose hours while driving from city to city, expanding your company and buying bigger/better semi trucks. The developer continues to update the game even though they are working on an American Truck Simulator. The enviroments don't look perfect but each truck is modeled directly from their real life counterpart and each drives differently. I've put in about 35 hours and I've only discovered 45% of the map. Still so much to discover!Update: It's still so relaxing and unwinding to drive a semi through Europe.			"

Then last week I read some reviews and though it sounded pretty decent so I took the plunge and bought it. And I must say it is probably the best decision I have ever made. I have only been playing it for a couple of days but I am hooked. So many other reviewers have said that it is the most relaxing game they have ever played and I have to say they are bang on the money. Just sit back, put your favourite radio station on (yes you can stream live radio stations in game) and chill out.This game gets a 10/10 from me.Happy Trucking People!!!			"

 Why ETS2?  The other day I was chatting about my future graduation occupation with my American English-teacher.He asked me what kind of job I want to take after graduation.Normally I would say something that’s related to my major like starting a business or being some clerk in a bank or a company.But I answered different this time, I said I wanted to be a truck driver.  Oh, that is out of the question for me, considering how weary it is to drive hours or even days to get the cargo to destination, like non-stop, literally.Although I’ve never been in the driver’s shoes, I imagine that being a truck driver must be  quite an interesting experience which takes up quite the courage and needs lots of self-discipline to obey the law, especially for someone who never obeys the law in any games. I believe most of us don’t. But will that apply to real life driving? That still remains a myth when so many car accidents happen every day.But it is interesting, adventurous, isn’t it?Driving for thousands of miles, seeing different places across the country, enjoying the scenery and listening to radios,Now I don’t have to race for win, but for loneliness, contemplating and enjoyment on the road.	Yeah, because in real life, when we are driving, from home to work, home to school, we are being with ourselves most of time. So it is in this game.We start off by taking jobs from other companies, and drive to deliver the cargo and get the payment, and repeat. Till we make enough money to afford a truck of our own, and a company of our own.From nobody to somebody.And that is a grass-root-counterattack in real life. Somehow I believe that we are imperceptibly influenced by many things- books, music, TV shows, movies and even games. And the last item allows us to experience things we’d never ever imagined of, as in protagonist.Maybe I didn’t write all this for ETS2, but without a question ETS2 is a great game to simulate a real truck driver. I want to highly recommend it to all of you although for some reasons I don’t have much time to spend on games, I wish I have.2017/3/9			"

												The reviews don't lie, this game is just awesome >_< My father, who was a truck driver and a gamer, would have really loved it! I can, for the first time in my life, know what is to drive on the left in England! I'm pretty sure to be really lost in the real life! Short. It's amazing to drive trucks. Discover the countries where live my international mates :) Germany, England, Austria, Poland, Belgium...! So cool!Deliver various materials, from simple to more complicated. From lightest to heaviest. In larger distances, as the smallest. Make money, manage a transport company, hire drivers and make fructuer my business. In addition, the game is not heavy, just over 2gb.I play with keyboard, but I can feel how it's hard to drive a truck and how it can be awesome. But I love trucks, and I really enjoy this game. Maybe it comes from my childhood and from the first loves of my father who brought back my first name from England during one of his trips. I was a little girl so proud... It's for these only good memories I love this game. Thanks to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and to the devs <3I definitely recommend this game to the trucks lovers			"

												You can listen to death metal on the radio whilst waitng at a red light.At first it seems like the most boring idea for a game ever but it's actually oddly addctive and you'll soon be sucked in and driving for 12 hours across Europe just so you can afford to buy a new paint job for your truck.Try the free demo if you're not sure.Good stuff.9/10.

												There are titles in the simulation market which can be sold on the novelty factor alone, but tend to be disappointing games.  Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not one of them, it is strangely cathartic, engaging and relaxing. Unlike other niche games, there is a smaller barrier to entry and features a simple control scheme for newcomers.  There are some reservations such as an infuriating penalty system and a lack of vehicles on major highways but these are outweighed by the positives.  Overall, for the fee of 20€, I would highly recommend this driving experience even if it’s not something that would usually be on your radar.			"

												Don't be fooled into taking a quick glance at this game and thinking it's a boring half-broken trucking simulator that you'll never play again after 10 minutes.  This game is the complete opposite of those things.While there is a bit of a learning curve at first (especially if you aren't from a European country), you can easily find yourself sinking a lot of time into this game.  The map for the game is very expansive, and it will take hundreds of hours of gameplay to discover every motorway, dual carriageway, small country road, and city.  Even with this game being out for over year and a half, the developers continue to provide new updates and DLC that continue to provide new and exciting things to try.  And if they don't provide something you want, the modding community is very large and there are many different sites each with a plethora of different mods you can try (modding is also as easy as dragging and dropping).  Want a fancy Peterbilt, or a map with over 200 cities covering almost all of Europe?  There are mods for those.In short, you won't be disappointed in this game if you enjoy casual trucking simulators.			"

												What I like about Euro Truck Simulator 2:It's my very first time playing a driving game since Late 1990's Nascar, and though I'm an adult and a great driver of U-Hauls, tractors, sports cars, and other fun on and off road vehicles in RL, this gives me a whole new outlook on driving! I've ridden in Rigs, many relatives of mine drive trucks, as well as a friend.  I stayed in my lane mostly (until I'd hit my touch pad on my laptop, haha). I moved my turn signals to A and D since I use my mouse to steer. Q became my brights. Gotta watch out if you pass up the gas station just a hair, there always seems to be a rig behind you and backing up ends up giving you a violation for a wreck! (Object's distance when that far back on a 1920x1080 resolution is nearly impossible to be able to judge how close that rig behind you stopped)  LOL  I only ran over about 15 cones in the construction area. (yeah, ONLY) haha.  (And a friend of mine was texting (in RL) while driving a rig in the game and she nearly blew through a tool booth! LMBO!!!)I found it fun.. Some may stress over it.. but to me, it's just a game and it's fun to explore what it is like to drive a rig in a virtual reality setting. Visuals are great! Just wish that camera sound would stop when taking images! Steam uses f12 for me and this game was using both f10 and f12. I deactivated the f10 option but f12 still makes that shutter sound. Steam settings have sounds turned off for ingame captures. No clue how to fix that issue.  I got a lot of speeding tickets too! haha When I very first started playing, I forgot it was not American and I went down the wrong side of the road .. Another violation! And people keep cutting me off!  But my rating for the fun/ease of use/ new experience - I'd give it a 8/10 myself. I haven't figured out yet if hazards or high beams affect but no headlights at night = ticket/fine/loss of money. Backing up is HARD for me. I jackknifed more than I care to admit..♥ Roll on 18 wheeler, Roll on! ♥I hope you guys can enjoy it as I did. One more note. I used keyboard and mouse.. Mouse to steer. I played 4.1 hours straight my first game.. Must say something about how cool I think it is.. ^.^ (And you don't have to hit E to start the engine. You can hit W as well, which is ""drive""..)  AND you can add your own music!!!  ( ♥  ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♫ ♪ ♥ )Keep an eye on your side view mirrors as you turn... Easy to hit a vehicle or other object (Signs, rails, buildings, trailers) if your turn is too sharp and getting up some hills is nearly impossible but not impossible :D You can also adjust your seats, position in the seat and other cool little tidbit settings ^.^Another note: I've only purchased the base game as it was a good deal but hope to purchase the others later, as they drop in price! :D  Have fun truckin' if you do like these types of games! It's great, I think!			"

												Experience the big rigs you dreamt of behind the wheels as the driver. It's a simulator which means you have got to be patient while you develop driving skills. The driver skills are a great way to upgrade the driving experience.It's not just about going places and admiring the scenery. You have got cash which means you gotta bank it. You start as an employee but sooner or later, with more jobs and more money, you get to have your own rig and build your own company. This is where I just love the gameplay! Especially when you are looking at the showroom and the expensive choices that feels just about real to make you value your hard earned income.There is a very dynamic weather available that can go from a quite sunny to a gushing thunderstorm that can test your road skills. The night cycle is really dark and you can customise headlights to view better. Nothing becomes frustrating. The cargo you carry come in different varieties and payloads.The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” AwardFor my final verdict, I give this game 9.5/10. I have avoided a perfect 10 because in my opinion, a much more interactive traffic AI and damage physics would be rewarding!			"

												Driving a virtual truck might not seem like the most exiting of things, but ETS 2 manages to achieve the improbable and actually makes it a very relaxing and fun experience to just put on your favourite music on the radio and roll across Europe delivering various goods and growing your trucking empire.It's one of the best driving simulators around and with great developer support from SCS and frequent updates and map expansions, especially the impressively detailed Scandinavia DLC, there is a lot to like about the game.Overall a great game from a good developer and one of those games that any good gaming library should have, for those times when you just want to sit back and drive for hours across Europe. Highly recommended. "

												My playtime says it all. Whether it's just to enjoy the scenery as you putz around the European countryside, or go all out and mod in fantastically heavy loads and try to get them to their destination on time in a hilariously underpowered truck, you just can't go wrong with this driving simulator with a business simulator tacked on. And not only is ETS2 a great way to chill out and listen to tunes, its also a somber reminder that once a business starts making enough money it can effectively ignore the law, run roughshod over the populace and pay the meager penalties imposed upon it by spineless governments.

												I suck with reviewsLike I'm terrible at them lolBut anyways**Or you could skip to the bottom for a warning about this game from an actual user**This game is incredibly relaxing.You can put in your own radio station and just drive around and make deliveries.I usually stick to news/talk radio if I ever get around to listening to it.Like the BBC for instance. Though most of it repeats during pretty much the length of your playtime.Speaking of playtimeIt's practically infinite. You drive, make deliveries, and buy new trucksI wasn't very fond of Simulation games at first, but after playing this one I can definitely see the appeal. And it's making  me want a sequel to this and leaves me in the mood to play other Simulation game.***WARNING***DO NOT LISTEN TO EUROBEAT OR ANYTHING FROM THE ANIME ""INITIAL D"" WHILE PLAYING THIS.YOU'LL BE SURPRISED THAT YOU COULD DRIFT WITH AN 18 WHEELERSURE YOU'LL GET TO YOUR DESTINATION FASTER, BUT AT WHAT COST!?YOU MIGHT EVEN BREAK DOWNHILL RECORDS!AND CHANGING THE COLOR OF YOUR CAB TO BLACK AND WHITE WILL NOT MAKE YOU FASTER!

												ETS2 is a zen game more than anything else.  No twitch gameplay here.  Just the mechanics of driving a tractor-trailor long-haul across the nation.  Is it uber realistic?  No, not really.  The scenery is abbreviated, the distances severely compressed and many of the systems are simplistic in their representation.But it works for me.  Why?  Because I used to drive long-haul in the lower 48.  I wouldn't want to spend several hours to get from one town to the next.  The distances in ETS2 are appropriate for a representation of what it is like.  But at the start and end of the journey the mechanics of picking up and dropping off the trailer remind me of my trucking days.  There's something satisfying in cutting the perfect corner, of figuring out how to approach that tricky dock and then just doing it.Colored by nastalgia?  Maybe.  But if the game is evoking nastalgia in this former trucker then clearly SCS is doing something right.			"

												Positives:- Does exactly what it says - simulates truck driving in Europe very well.- Developer support has been fantastic.  The game feels very different compared to what it was in April 2013 compared to December 2013 due to various improvements (dynamic auto transmission, dynamic fuel, other tweaks)- New trucks are being added to the game for free.  In other games, these would be DLCs.- DLCs are very modestly priced, great value for money.- Very easy to install mods from a highly active modding community.- SCS official forums are a great place to ask for help in a mature manner.  i.e. Very informative, but not suitable for the attention-deficit crowd.Negatives:- You'd better love trucks and simulation or else you'd die of boredom.- Trucks probably handle a little too well around tight bends.- Some bends and gradient changes can be smoother.- UK motorway design is very Continental.- AI traffic have their annoying quirks  (but the developer says they are working on improving this).

												All my life I've waited for a realistic driving sim. Playing with mods in GTA to make it more realistic, trying, and being dissapointed by ""educational"" sims, until I found SCS' previous game UK Truck Simulator. Now with ETS2 though it's almost become the game I've dreamed of.I've never had a particular interest in trucks, I've put in 1000s more hours into riding motorcycles than cars even, but if you're the sort of person that finds driving relaxing, even if you don't think trucks are interesting, you'll probably love this game. And even better there's a Linux release!The two map DLCs (Going East, and Scandinavia), are highly recommended, as is playing with a 900 degree steering wheel (even a cheap one makes it tons more fun, no need to spend 100s on a Logitech wheel), but the game is still plenty of fun without. Overall I'd rate this game 5/5. There are some small nuances such as the AIs inability to use roundabouts properly, and poor signage in the non DLC map, but overall they're nothing in comparison to the overall quality of the game.

												It's hard to review a game which is such simple and at the same time so complex. It's name says everything - it's a truck simulator so what exacly would you expect from it?You'll find few trucks which you can costomize from looks to performance. If you feel like manager - you can always buy some garages and hire truckers to work their♥♥♥♥♥for you. The roads are preety the same and it might get a little dull after time but if you pick the off-highway roads you'll find some really nice places and sights to watch. Graphics are nice and game itself is nicely optimized so you shouldn't have problems running it even with older PCs.Traffic AI in Singleplayer is nice and feels real and weather chaning conditions are just a jelly on top. The best fun is when you play it with a controler or with a wheel. I played it with keyboard and mouse but after getting myself a driving wheel the gameplay experiance just hit the top. The DLCs comming out are quite balanced between the price and value and there are plenty of discounts and bundles to pick. I strongly suggest getting the map DLCs because they are simply better then the basic ETS2.To sum up - if you like simulation games and you are into trucks this is definitly worth your money. Just remember that multiplayer is something completly diffrent and unfortunetly things that happen online have little common with reality or simulation but most of the time it's nice to drive behind a real person not AI. Anyway - I recommend this game and hope that SCS will continue to develop this product.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that simulates the life of a truck driver. Lately the game came with many graphical improvements and physically. You have several options to customize the tractor for free. The big problem with this game is financial. Expansion packs, custom paints and other things like ""Cabin Accessories"" cost. The game updates are focusing just for fixing bugs and implementing a single new thing, everything else costs. To buy the game, the expansions, 2 DLC (High Power Cargo and Cabin Accessories) and all of the paints cost around 89,21€.To buy just the game and the expansions with the 2 DLC it's cost 56,45€.I think is too much for a game like that.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2, SCS Software tarafından çıkarılmış olan bir kamyon simülasyonudur.19 Ekim 2012'de çıkmış olan oyun günümüz Avrupa'sını temel almıştır. Oyunda Scania, Volvo, MAN, DAF, Iveco, Renault ve Mercedes- Benz olmak üzere 7 adet lisanslı kamyon markası bulunmaktadır. Ayrıca SCS Software'nin oyuncular için yayınladığı güncellemeler ile yeni model çekiciler oyuna dahil edildimekte, oyun dinamikleri daha da geliştirilmektedir.

												This is one of the best games I have ever played. I know it may seem rather unusual for a woman to be interested in a game such as this, but that's mainly a stereotype. I enjoy the relaxing feeling I get from just driving around from place to place taking in all the scenery from city to city. Euro truck 2 for me captures the very essence of logistics. It's a game I could see myself playing non stop, and I am talking hours at a time of game play. My favorite series of trucks in this game are of course Scania, but I found that all of the trucks besides Scania have a unique look and feel to them. The graphics are amazing simply breath taking and the ability to take photographs in game are an added bonus that I am sure will please anybody trying this game for the first time. I highly recommend you grab this game try the demo first see if you like it. I am pretty sure you will find it as pleasing as I did.			"

												Simulators tend to be hit and miss, but this is no doubt a hit. This is a game where you can chill, as though you are indeed driving through Europe. When you do the larger missions, completion is fabulously rewarding, as is the excitment the game manages to give when you purchase your own truck.They have managed to get the scaling down of Europe and the speed of time spot on in my opinion. The perfection means that it's not too slow going from one country to another, but there is a certain marathon of time to fare in driving. I think this plays an important role in how much satisfaction the game gives you; getting 20,000 virtual pounds has never felt so good after an hour's drive.I'm not going to pretend this game is bang on though. Things do end up being repetitive; for example the locations for a company are exactly the same style of building no matter where you are. There are limited AI cars (themselves a bit dim-witted), the motorways could do with being a little bit busier (like rush hour), and the turn off junctions on motorways are extremelly inaccurate.My suggestions for an update would be to allow the driver to skip a track whilst driving in music, and for the fuel prices to be updated through the internet to match the current prices. Surely that's not too difficult?That may sound like a proper moan, but these are tiny issues that can't overlap the fact that this is a very well designed game with jaw-dropping physics on the trucks. Just don't tell your friends that this is a more enjoyable game than most action games out there...			"

												Best Driving Simulator I know, if you love Simulator Games, and love Trucks or driving around Cities, this is the right game for you!Controlls are simple and works very nice with keyboard, controller works too but it was not comfortable because locking around is painfull when you drive.You can choose if you are M or F, buy later your owen Truck, get better jobs and earn more money. With the new DLC you can travel around Europe, ok locations are not original but still nice.There is also a Mod now to play this game Online, thats very funny, the Mod is free and works for an Alpha pretty good.You also can add your owen music into the game (ogg files) or listen to the radio. if you know a radio station you can add this too, so you feel more real.

												Wow, still haven't reviewed this game, even after 50 hours of playing and recording it. Well let me tell you that this can be a very serious, or a very non-serious and arcadey game, depending on how you go about playing the game.Simulation-y things to do:Obey traffic lightsObey speed limitObey laws of gravityRefuel when the tank runs reasonably lowHave traffic accidents once in a whileNon-simulation-y things to do:Disable speed limiter, race up to 170km/h (might end badly)Run traffic lightsCrash into cars (for fun, of course)Roll your truck over, explode into flames (for fun, of course)Play dubstep as you're road-warrioring around EuropeSee if you can make the next fuel station even as you're running on fumesBut, as I said, it depends on how you play it.If someone said to me, 'Tim, you wanna play this game in which you drive around and all over Europe, chilled like? Look around at the serene scenery and the plush countryside? Listen to the engine purr at the touch of your feet?'I would buy it. And you should too.			"

												For a person without driver's license, or  drive a heavy truck, it's good to be able to experience driving a heavy truck on the road, under the cloud and sun.Game experience is very easy. just drive.But I don't have a license, so most time my attention has been focused on the road, no time to look at the roadside scenery. (Although the roadside scenery is not very detailed)Light effect is great, but raindrops looks fake.Music and radio need to be manually added, if they can be pre-included in advance.The steam cloud save for this game is not for the game save. So You can't play with a single save at 2 different PC. That's bad. The most important point:It takes 1 hour to complete a transportation task.15 minutes on the road.45 minutes to unload.Just for me....Who can teach me how to unload @_@			"

												I've been fan of trucking games since Hard Truck 2: King of the Road came out and i also happend to be fan of any kind of open world games, but thats just one of the many reasons i love Euro Truck Simulator 2. As you might have guessed the game is about simulating trucking, your main job is delivering cargo around Europe and in case you want full simulation you will have to refuel once in a while, get sleep when you get tired, repair your truck and so on. It's important to note that the trucks are very fun to drive and feel pretty realistic, and once you gather enough money you can upgrade and mod them.The game itself provides great graphics, physics and mechanics. Also the map and the environment are very beautiful and very massive, which is making your trucking experience even better! What also is worth to be mentioned is the huge modding community which is taking part into improving the game a lot, for example there is multiplayer mod that came out few months ago, so now you can truck with your buddies as well!Some people will find this game boring at first, but once in a while its good taking rest of fast-paced games and just drive, chill and listen to your favorite radio station meanwhile, not to mention the fun situations you will get into. :)			"

												I... I just... I don't understand.This game... it shouldn't be fun, it's got all of the makings of everything boring. It's a game where you drive on the motorway to deliver stuff to warehouses. But it's fun... Euro Truck Simulator 2 is sort of like being shown a 4D cube as a citizen of the 3D universe. It just baffles you. For starters, I haven't played the other ""simulator"" games like Train Simulator or Garbage Truck Simulator (seriously?), I bought this because something just compelled me to. Perhaps it appealed to my secret yearning to drive around Liverpool in a giant truck in the rain with my windscreen wipers on. It's a great simulation, the controls work brilliantly (though I had to tweek them a little to fit my preferences) and it recreates the roads of the world quite accurately (I assume, I only know the roads of North England). My only real gripe with the game is that it doesn't seem to actually simulate the cities of Europe. When I said you can drive around Liverpool, you can only really drive around the outskirts of the city. It's really a shame, but I suppose the game makers didn't have time to recreate the major cities of Europe.You'll probably find this game a lot less bewildering than I did if you like boring stuff like driving down the motorway. It practically infuriates me how this game is fun when it shouldn't appeal at all.I don't think I'd pay the full £15 for this unless I was a real truck/driving fanatic, but in the sales I'd go for it.

												[Review based on MP Mod]Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an anomaly in itself and the multiplayer is very well done because of the sudden and unexpected moments it creates. The truck driving and beautifully weaved scenery gives you goose bumps for the immersion it hands to you. The game itself is quite unique in its own respect as it breaks all the arbitrary boundaries and restrictions that many other simulators place on the table. Euro Truck Simulator 2 liberates itself and goes above all the others.But why is Euro Truck Simulator 2 fun?Euro Truck Simulator 2 completely redefines the epitome of the simulator. Even though it is quite esoteric in the way it is built, it still offers a wide array of features which all come together to make it a fabulous game.I consider Euro Truck Simulator 2 the leader of all simulation games and is very idiosyncratic to me as it gives me open world features which lead me to have  a freedom of choice in all my actions including  as where i want to go around Europe. Aswell as that, the multiplayer enviroment allows me to junket around and witness the often hilarious moments of seeing others jack-knifing their trucks in traffic which leads them on to rage in chat.Many open world games are quite infinitesimal; but not Euro Truck Simulator.The world is large and has many different high poly models which help it represent what it is. These models include world wonders such as the Eiffel Tower.Once you are immersed in the world you often become oblivious of your real life chores and you struggle choosing between bed time or ""Just... one.. more.. job!"". Your real life will become a red herring to Euro Truck.Although this game was released in a precocious state it has been patched and made better with recent additions and when Multiplayer was added. Multiplayer has revolutionalized the state of the game for many players, including me. Aswell as that, multiplayer has paved the way for social interactions between players and players making rules as to what is propriety.Now what is Euro Truck on its own?Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a vast and open world game with a high amount of immersion thanks to its highly detailed cabin with fantastic textures including normal maps and high poly models. These highly detailed models allow for us to revel and bask in all their eternal glory and is just scintillating in the way they are designed exactly like the real trucks.The sound engine in the game is just phenomenal ranging from turbo whistles to indicators and to idle truck noises it really pops into your head wherever you are and becomes very ubiquitous.Overall I consider Euro Truck Simulator an absolutely marvellous game which all compiles together to create a fantastic experience through sound, graphics, immersion, social aspects and even the driving mechanics.Just don't mention the Artificial Intelligence. (atleast it's disabled in MP).. please.			"

												Awesome Game!  I love it and have joined a virtual trucking company.  I have an appreciation for truckers after playing this game.  I enjoy the support of the modding community.  ProMods and TruckSim Map are the best but there are other maps that are fun to drive.  And there are many othe mods availble other than maps. I've been playing for six months and I have not grown tired of the interesting game play.What I really like is you can go for authenticity or you can play free form and dare I say cheat!  That's why its a Sim play it your way not everyone has the time to master all aspects of the game so drive enjoy listen to some tunes on the built in radio and most of all Happy Trucking!			"

												Not a game I normally would play, yet somehow I am playing it, and it's stupidly, mystifyingly, inexplicably good.  Well, I *can* explain it, actually -- the developers clearly care about the quality of their product enough to pack it full of crazy detail in pretty much every aspect of the game.  The environments are ridiculously beautiful, the weather patterns are a joy to see in action, the trucks are shiny and gorgeous (and customizable), the driving is challenging *and* fun, and there's also a business management game built into all of that.  Pretty cool.So yeah. Trucks.More fun than you'd expect.			"

												When I first heard about the game, I was immediately put off by the notion of driving trucks. I'm not a racing fan, as the novelty of driving supercars has long since worn off. With the plethora of so called simulators flooding the market (farm simulator, goat simulator, you get the idea), I avoided these sim games until I watched my friend play on his PC with a wheel setup. I was immediately awe-struck at how good and immersive driving a truck felt on a wheel setup, by the time I got off from his PC, I noticed already 2 hours had passed. I haven't been this immersed in a game like this in a long, long time. What really piqued my interest in the game is how you begin from scratch of just having opened a truck company with no trucks of your own. You earn your keep and livelihood driving trucks for other companies. On long hauls across the European landmarks, with Brian Eno's music playing on the radio, I contemplated how nice it would be to finally own a truck of my own and hire drivers to do my bidding. A couple of weeks later and with enough savings, I was able to buy my very own first truck. But that was just the beginning of it.If you're looking to play destruction derby or Forza/GT type experience, then you're looking in the wrong section. ETS2 offers something unique and captivating other driving games fail to offer.This game also has an amazing mod community which has a lot to offer.Very highly recommended for everyone who are sick of playing cops vs racers & driving supercars/ sportscars over the same landscape over and over. Its a nice change in pace and you will love every moment of it.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2; its often difficult to explain to people what makes this game so immersive and fun to play. You can easily put hours into this game and never realise. After putting 162 hours into the game myself, I figured I should leave a review! Basically, this game gives you the freedom to travel the roads of Europe, driving any truck you desire, completing jobs from Aberdeen in Scotland to Lublin in Poland and everything in between. The trucks are fully customisable, and there is also a level up system, allowing for longer distance jobs, eco driving, more important cargo and better trucks unlocked. You may purchase your own garages in the cities you visit across Europe, and hire drivers to work for your company. The more you earn, the more upgrades you can do to your garages and the more trucks you can buy as well. The devs at SCS are excellent and come out with great updates and DLCs. Also, if you're a modder, this game has a great modding community and awesome scope for mods of all kinds. It is a great simulation game, if you have a wheel and pedals to use, the experience is even better. But you can also use a normal gamepad if you desire rather than keyboard, it is up to you how you play. The trucks drive like they should do, you can feel the weight of the trailers you pick up. One of the things I love most about this game is the environment. SCS have done a great job with creating the world of ETS2, and each country has a slightly different feel. I love driving through the Austrian mountains as well as the countryside in the UK. The weather and lighting is also brilliantly done. I have owned ETS2 since February 2013, and I still enjoy playing. I highly recommend this game!EDIT: Nominated for Just 5 More Minutes Award! (29/11/16)			"

												Euro Truck Simulator. Three words which, in isolation, seem innocuous enough, but which when spoken in sequence can put even the most ardent gamer to sleep.If you’re still reading this, then that means you’re still awake. You passed the first test.If my tone seems cruel and mocking now, that’s because when I first heard about ETS, I did cruelly mock it. Trucks? Boring. Simulation games? Boring. That’s what my STUPID brain thought when I read the title, and it relayed the various commands so that I might signify my condescension. Fake yawn, patronising shake of the head, roll the eyes. Fart a little bit - my bottom pleading to be involved somehow. And so I ignored it, for about a year after its release, until I read an article (I forget where, or by whom) which said that even though it sounds like it’ll be boring, it actually isn’t. It is. It is a bit boring, but in a good way. First, the meat. ETS is a game where you drive a truck and deliver goods around Europe. You start off doing freight jobs in loaned trucks, but will eventually earn enough to buy your own, which is when you’ll see real money coming in. You’ll continue earning money until you can rent premises, hire people and buy more trucks for them to deliver goods in, earning you even more money. That’s it, really. There’s not much to the business management side of things, so once you’ve got your own truck you could just ignore that aspect entirely. Control options are fairly customisable, which is nice. I play on a 360 pad (very “casual mode”) with all the assists turned on and automatic gearing and whatnot, and it’s lovely. Relaxing. But if you want you can have 50 different buttons on the keyboard devoted to different functions and really take control. The holy grail, of course, is playing with a wheel and decent pedals, but I doubt I’ll ever get the chance to try that out.After I played the demo until about 3am, I decided to buy ETS. I couldn’t say that I had had a lot of fun, precisely, or that I’d learned anything about what it is to drive a truck, or any other aspect of trucking. But as the rain fell upon my cab in Calais, and the wipers swished hypnotically back and forth, back and forth, I had felt tremendously involved. In that time I’d gone from Manchester to London, then all the way to Scotland on some slow, winding roads, and then belted back down south and across the channel. I’d signalled properly, watched my speed, and stopped at the lights like a good boy. Is this even a proper game? Where are the zombies?Often, when we talk about games we talk about atmosphere. How does this game conjure the atmosphere or exploring an underwater wreck, or how does this one make you feel like you’re in the middle of a war, running for your life. ETS has an amazing amount of atmosphere: you really will feel like you’re sat in traffic on the M56. And if that sounds mundane, fair enough, it probably is, but somehow this game seeps into your pores and you start to care. You want to make your delivery on time, and you want your cargo to be undamaged, and you want to ease the trailer into the bay like a boss (your first time around this will seem impossible). It can be tremendously satisfying to get things right, and very stressful when things start to go wrong. I remember driving past my exit somewhere in Germany and having to take a huge detour. Pressed for time and with my truck running on fumes, I started driving faster, more recklessly. That job cost me a lot of money, and in real life, would have earned me some serious jail time.Speaking of jail time, the way fines and penalties are handled in this game is a little odd. There are no rozzers to speak of, and when you, for example, hit another car or run a red light you will automagically be fined a set amount of money, curse under your breath and continue on your way. That’s it. It’s a bit disappointing to me that even if you careen into a mini at 100mph, there will be no real negative consequence to that. A small fine, that’s it. Worse still is the infuriating way speed cameras are handled. If you’re doing 31 in a 30 zone as you pass one, you’ll get a fine. Shouldn’t there be a bit of leeway, like in real life? I’m not sure what the game is “simulating” in that situation. The AI in this game is hilarious at times, too. I remember once a car flashed me to let me out of a busy junction, and I thought that was great. It didn’t seem like a scripted response at all, and I honked my horn in approval. That’s only even happened once in about 60 hours. More often than not you’ll see drivers stopping dead on the sliproad for no reason, or entering a roundabout in the wrong lane at the wrong time as you pull 22 tons of furniture in their path. I remember one particularly determined driver who got himself wedged under my trailer as he tried to change lanes. I got a big “collision” fine for no reason, and he put his hazards on, pointlessly. I’d like to say this stuff is rare, but usually you’ll see some crazy AI behaviour on every job you take.Look, I love this game. It’s what I love to play when I want to unwind. Undeniably, it is repetitive. Even if you’re going somewhere new - and on a map this size you often are - you’re still essentially going through the motions. But, like taking a big dump, these motions are very satisfying, and the odd glitches and quirks of the AI add to the charm somehow. It’s a big achievement that a simulation game, such as it is, has managed to find quite so broad an audience. Give the generous demo a try, and I think you’ll soon be seduced by its shiny, chrome encrusted charms.			"

												This is an odd game to review because, like Crusader Kings II, it's fun - but a very specific kind of fun that might not be for everyone. This is obviously a driving sim with a healthy mix of logistics and entrepreneurship and it's hard to sell that to people who aren't already interested in it, which is why the trailer to this game looks lost and confused. People like videos that highlight the action and, honestly, this isn't a game that has a lot of it. This game doesn't have explosions, it's relaxing, if anything. You transport objects and make money doing it. For some people, this is boring, but for the target audience, that's a cool concept in and of itself. It's probably the meat of what people describe as being the intangible backbone of what makes this game good.What makes life in this game tolerable? Well, the first thing that comes to mind is that an enormous amount of time was spent trying to get the roads and scenery to look convincing. If you're on the M5 and pause the game, go to Google and drop the streetview cam on the approximate spot where your truck is, it's going to be pretty darn similar to what you'll see. Road signs will toned down and simplified, but the traffic cams will not. People without cars will soon learn what a pain in the butt they are for commuters. Road patterns like interstate on/off ramps will be recycled, but that's pretty much what happens in real life as well.When driving down an interstate, it's obviously not in anyone's interest to make a two hour trip to Bristol actually take two real world hours, so time and distance are abridged. So are cities and the insane traffic patterns and congestion associated with it. This means that, sometimes, it's O.K. to go to London.The game can be as accurate as you like when it comes to operating your truck, from incomprehensible (how gears work in real life) to arcade (magic transmission - W means go).Radio stations are real. If you choose, you can have your truck radio stream the actual radio stations of whatever country you want and whatever languages they are broadcast in. This is a pretty fun feature and adds to the immersion in the game.The biggest downside? Traffic. It's inconsistent and has a few bugs. The most pressing one is that NPC drivers have no concept of their own safety. Honestly, I'm not sure what their pathing is, but they seem to cruse right into you as if you were not there, even with proper signaling. That said, they're better than I expected for AI behavior for the most part. If you signal that you want to turn across an oncoming lane, the cars will ocasionally stop and flash their lights to indicate that they're willing to stop for you to get across.An unrelated disappointment is that weather is not dynamic to your location, it's a global setting. So, the chance of rain in Glasgow is the same as Paris.The final remarkable disappointment I can think of is that, like I mentioned earlier, roads and cities are abridged. And while I definitely don't mind avoiding cities for their suicidal traffic AI, they're very unconvincing for the most part. Unless it's is a larger city that they are particularly proud of, like Klagenfurt and Venice, the majority of ""cities"" are maybe ten blocks? Residential areas and all? It makes the final destination a repetitive anticlimactic end to a long drive.The game is still being worked on, obviously. Scandinavia will be released at some point and there's already a host of mods for amateur-created areas. At some point, it's possible that the drawbacks I've mentioned will be taken care of. Even if they aren't, there are far worse and game breaking problems that it could have, but doesn't. The devs have put a tremendous amount of time into this unfathomably large and complicated project and it's solid because of that. As far as a truck driving sim goes, this is probably as good as it gets for the foreseeable future. "

												What an absolutely fantastic game! I have played this game for nearly 4 years and it is astonishing. As you can tell by the amount of hours I have on it, you can see that this is a game that I am very fond of. The single player is good as it gives you the opportunity to build your own company from scratch and also use some of the awesome modifications that the games brilliant modding community has created. Then we get to the multiplayer....... this mod brings a whole new life to the game as it allows you to truck around Europe with your friends! Not only that, the MP allows you to build up your own virtual trucking company or join one of the many ones that already exist. If this doesn't interest you, why not join one of the many convoys that are hosted each week? After all, the multiplayer is free so you have nothing to lose.I stronly recommend you purchase this game if you just want to sit back and relax and hit the endless amount of tarmac that this game has to offer.

												A lot of times you hear the word simulator and you get a little intimidated, expecting a steep learning curve.  But this game does a good job of easing the new player in.  It's also a great game to unwind to.  You can pick a radio station to listen to (or put in your own music), and relax to some music as you drive to your next destination.There's a ton of customization options for your truck, if you are into that sort of thing.  But this game has a lot to offer casual players as well.  I would definitely recommend this game, especially if you enjoy driving and you are looking for a change of pace from the usual racing games/crash simulators.Also, you can play this game with a keyboard or mouse, but I highly recommend a steering wheel.  I ended up buying a Logitech GT racing wheel with pedals.  My daughter makes fun of me because I have this fancy setup, and all I do is deliver cargo with it.			"

												Why is this game good?For me it's really the relaxation I get from playing with this game. It's not a racesim, it's not fast phased action. It's just driving around Europe, enjoying the view and listening to some chill music.Couple of years ago (I'm not really sure how, I don't have a special love for trucks and I never played drive-sims) I've ended up on their website. Tried the ETS2 demo. Didn't had a steeringwheel, so tried the demo with KB+M. Altho that sucks (if you ask me), I really loved the game (/sim) in a heartbeat. Bought the game, orderd the G27, and since then it's 1 of my most favorite ''game''. I like a ton of games, with more action, options and faster phase in it, but none of the games can relax me as good as ETS2. ATS was an insta-buy for me, like all the DLC's are for ETS2 and future DLC's of ATS will be. I even bought ETS and 2 other games from this company, just to show them how much I appreciate them.			"

												This is an awesome truck driver simulator game.  I play with an xbox Gempad controller and use the joystick to steer and it works very well.  The game is immersive and let's you play your own music through the radio.  You can work for other companies making deliveries or you can buy a truck and start your own company and even hire other drivers.  You get to drive in some nice scenery, realistic traffic and even get fines for not obeying traffic signals.  I'd recommend this game - it's a high quality truck driver/delivery simulator.			"

												Driving a truck through europe.....snorefest much?That was my first thought when I got this game and most people I know share that thought. There was a huge hype over the game tho so I gave it a shot.........took me ONE tour to hook me up. Seriously. Whats fun about this game?Your truck is a big slow brute, almost everything on the road is faster then you, your acceleration is matching a snails and turning takes hours (felt)...WHAT exactly can be fun about it?For me.....- its very relaxing to follow the street and be challenged with realistic physics and traffic rules- visuals are AWESOME if you take the time to look around there are so many details - a skill system enables you to evolve and improve your own driver and build up a trucking company- mostly its about the EXPERIENCE, its not a racer, its not a reaction game....it enabley you to do something most people cannot do in real life ----> commanding 800 horse power at your leasureI am playing it with keyboard and mouse (for steering and looking around) which works out quite well for me once I adjusted various sensetivities. I seriously consider getting me a steering wheel, camera (to enable me to ""look"" around with my head) and pedals for better control tho.It certainly isnt for everybody. I m just saying you dont know if its your game or not if you dont give it a chance. I ""thought"" this would never work for me and here I am....happily trucking away while my wife watches me shaking her head :)			"

												I never thought i will ever like such game. I always thought it‘s very boring and repetitive and it will be fun only for an hour or so. But i was wrong. I decided to risk and buy this and i didn‘t regret this. The game is great. It looks repetitive and boring but when you play it somehow time flies very fast. It‘s very relaxing game for me. Just open the beer, turn on the in game radio (which by the way has real stations) or your music library and start driving. It really feels very good. Especially when you‘re driving at night on narrow roads while raining.The controls are very precise, trucks have fully functioning dashboard. Everything you do is displayed correctly on in-game dashboard, from wheel turning to wipers and turn signals. The game is designed to play with a steering wheel, it really adds to the game. I tried to play it with an xbox gamepad before, but it wasn‘t so fun.The graphics can be ugly at times and sometimes it‘s great. Especially at night while raining, it looks amazing. Worst thing about graphics is that the game does not support AA. The performance is not very good too. Bearing in mind that the graphics is not the strongest side of the game the performance should be much better. You need quite a powerful computer to play it on high settings. But it's nowhere near unplayable. It just could be better in this department.The game has plenty of mods which adds new maps, trailers, logos or improve the graphics so the game will not get boring for a long time.Don‘t think and just buy it, especially if you have a steering wheel and you love drving games, this is a must have.

There are not all European countries but some of them like:FranceGermanyEnglandAustriaCzech Republic SwedenYou taking a job to transfer items from one place to second place. That can be fuel,woods,etc.... You have a time in how much hours you must deliver items when you will need a rest. You need to rest and give fuel to your truck, take care of him if he gets too much damage you will need to repair it. There's a traffic but no police. You need to stick to rules, don't crash into cars, don't go in a wrong way, don't go when it's red because you will need to pay. Also repairing it's not so cheap. You can get more workers and better trucks. There's also freedom where you can discover new areas. You drive at night too. In fact the game is awesome. Nice simulator game.9/10, Game should game Sweden,Norway,Finland etc... for winter roads.! Otherwise, it's really awesome simulator.!			"

												Here's a serious review of ETS2.Basically I was not into trucking until I downloaded (and bought later) Euro truck simulator 2. The thing which grabbed me were the nice graphics, the story (having your own logistics company) and well that's it. After playing it I realised that this game is very addictive, because it's very entertaining. Do you think that wasting gaming time on driving virtual trucks is boring? Well, think again mate. This game offers a lot of hours in ways such as customizing trucks, exploring cities & roads, explore trucks & garages and making sure your logistics company runs smoothly. The game might be stressful in the beginning, because truck driving is different from driving a car. But trust me, it's totally worth it. This game not only satisfy me, but it also gave me some passion about trucks. So, stop looking at reviews and check this game out immediately!!			"

												This game without a doubt is awesome, but is missing a few key elements for it to be complete. I'm not sure why, but I got in the mood to drive a truck with a trailer. For some reason, the challenge of wanting to be able to maneuver a tight turn was a yearning. Therefore I was willing to try the best of the best so they were saying.Upon choosing a character skin, truck skin, and company logo I embarked on my journey to become a trucker. The menu is extremely friendly (and very chic) and allows you to change almost anything. Controller compatibility is also accommodated here to a great extent. ETS2 has great gameplay. Steering, driving, shifting, turning, backing up all feel quite accurate. Don't go around holding the gas all the time though. I got a few speeding tickets that way. This would be an ideal dream for those who played Grand Theft Auto and loved to drive by the rules. Actually following the rules of the road in such a big machine is quite tough, at least from a first person view. Lining up the truck nicely when coming out from the curb to see oncoming traffic poses quite the challenge. This game definitely gave me an inside look of the difficulties truckers face when driving. There are a lot of side jobs that are offered and jobs that you can take upon yourself counting towards for your company. I would highly suggest practicing driving in reverse as it is one of the most difficult tasks you may encounter. The ability to build up a company and hire drivers is an enjoyable experience, but can feel like a grind at first. What was a neat feature was that sometimes the AI would let you merge when changing lanes, and sometimes there were AI that crashed into one another which would lead them to turn their hazards on. Sounds cool, up until your stuck behind crashed AI that won't PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD! It's hard going around signs and cars with a giant tractor trailer.  Visuals are extremely appealing and all the truck details seem to be there. Roads are complete with beautiful scenery and weather conditions. Besides driving in the sun, night or the rain, it would have been nice to be challenged with a bit of snow.Sounds seem as real as they get. It's nice driving and simply hearing a motor running. What I do want to make a few remarks about is the fact that you aren't able to drive up on ferries and board them when going across seas... which was sort of disappointing considering. Another disappointing fact was drivers don't seem to have any personality. Bland AI seems to be driving around everywhere. I wouldn't mind seeing someone react to me honking, or some crazy idiot driving swerving through lanes or trying to cut me off, or the slow guy that everyone passes. I know this game was meant for proper driving but I'd love to see a few collision mechanics at their best. What would be a huge deal breaker would be to add pedestrians. Yes it could be gruesome (so add an option to turn it off?) but watching over for civilians crossing is something to keep in mind when driving!  All that being said, I would still like to see a truck driving simulating game that puts the player in a city where they have to make turns in busy pedestrian and traffic scenarios.

												TLDR version - Don't wait, just go buy it! You won't regret it!Updated after patch 1.9:Absolutely fantastic work by the devs! New AI makes the NPC AI vehicles behave closer to real-world drivers (and sometimes they behave like idiots too, just like real world drivers!). New physics means your truck now will shake, wobble, etc etc depending on the weight of the load and the speed you're going at, as well as the terrain you're moving on.Fine attention to details such as traffic lights going from red to green immediately in some cities, and in other cities, going from red to amber to green. Truly amazing update! Makes a great game even better!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Normal version:Wow... this is a sleeper hit for me. When this first got released, I never even gave it a second look - ""What's so fun about driving a truck?"". I play simulators like F16s, Flanker, and so on. To me, this would probably be as boring as watching paint dry.Well amazingly, it IS fun. A friend kept recommending it to me so I finally caved and said ""Ok I'll try it but I'm not gonna like it"" and so I downloaded the demo, gave it a whirl and I changed my mind really quick! I was wrong about all the preconceived notions I had about this game.I can't really describe to you how sometimes it can be relaxing to be driving across Europe, or sometimes it can be frustrating as heck. Adding mods to this game, changes this game from ""great"" to ""awesome""... like how Skyrim is great in its own right but when you add mods to Skyrim it becomes awesome. Same for this. You need to see the content the talented community has produced and you'd be amazed!			"

												This is my truck. There are many like it, but this one is mine.My truck is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.My truck, without me, is useless. Without my truck, I am useless. I must drive my truck true. I must drive straighter than my enemy who is trying to ram me. I must out-turn him before he cuts me off because he's a ♥♥♥♥ing South American. My truck and I know that what counts in war is not the deliveries we undertake, the noise of our stacks, nor the smoke from burning sweet diesel. My truck is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its signals and its gears. I will keep my truck clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other.Before GabeN, I swear this creed. My truck and I are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy, but peace!			"

												This game without a doubt is awesome, but is missing a few key elements for it to be complete. I'm not sure why, but I got in the mood to drive a truck with a trailer. For some reason, the challenge of wanting to be able to maneuver a tight turn was a yearning. Therefore I was willing to try the best of the best so they were saying.Upon choosing a character skin, truck skin, and company logo I embarked on my journey to become a trucker. The menu is extremely friendly (and very chic) and allows you to change almost anything. Controller compatibility is also accommodated here to a great extent. ETS2 has great gameplay. Steering, driving, shifting, turning, backing up all feel quite accurate. Don't go around holding the gas all the time though. I got a few speeding tickets that way. This would be an ideal dream for those who played Grand Theft Auto and loved to drive by the rules. Actually following the rules of the road in such a big machine is quite tough, at least from a first person view. Lining up the truck nicely when coming out from the curb to see oncoming traffic poses quite the challenge. This game definitely gave me an inside look of the difficulties truckers face when driving. There are a lot of side jobs that are offered and jobs that you can take upon yourself counting towards for your company. I would highly suggest practicing driving in reverse as it is one of the most difficult tasks you may encounter. The ability to build up a company and hire drivers is an enjoyable experience, but can feel like a grind at first. What was a neat feature was that sometimes the AI would let you merge when changing lanes, and sometimes there were AI that crashed into one another which would lead them to turn their hazards on. Sounds cool, up until your stuck behind crashed AI that won't PULL OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD! It's hard going around signs and cars with a giant tractor trailer.  Visuals are extremely appealing and all the truck details seem to be there. Roads are complete with beautiful scenery and weather conditions. Besides driving in the sun, night or the rain, it would have been nice to be challenged with a bit of snow.Sounds seem as real as they get. It's nice driving and simply hearing a motor running. What I do want to make a few remarks about is the fact that you aren't able to drive up on ferries and board them when going across seas... which was sort of disappointing considering. Another disappointing fact was drivers don't seem to have any personality. Bland AI seems to be driving around everywhere. I wouldn't mind seeing someone react to me honking, or some crazy idiot driving swerving through lanes or trying to cut me off, or the slow guy that everyone passes. I know this game was meant for proper driving but I'd love to see a few collision mechanics at their best. What would be a huge deal breaker would be to add pedestrians. Yes it could be gruesome (so add an option to turn it off?) but watching over for civilians crossing is something to keep in mind when driving!  All that being said, I would still like to see a truck driving simulating game that puts the player in a city where they have to make turns in busy pedestrian and traffic scenarios. Sure it would be hard to make entire maps for cities, but even have a few scenarios to choose from with a few tight roads to outmaneuver through would be cool. On the road in the country side, adding wild animals would be another idea to think about. Would make night driving interesting. This may be veering to close to reality but adding actual police cars that pull the truck over would intensify the experience. Imagine a car chase with a truck! The game is good and would recommend a purchase on sale. I really hope though they do add what I mentioned into future games as I would literally like to foresee the trip on and off the road.

												I saw this game was the Deal of the Day about a week ago, and so I checked it out. It appeared to be one of those forgettable games with a generic name that was just trying to cash in on based on just the picture from Steam's store page, but I was intrigued anyway because I love all things cars and trucks, though I've mostly been stuck as a car hobbyist and racing genre fan, and never played driving simulation games. Based on the reviews I saw, this one was worth checking out--so I bought it and the Going East DLC.Short summary: this game is awesome in so many different ways. You start out as a low tier leveled business owner, and they don't give you any benefits of the doubt--you have so little money, you don't even get your own truck (yet). You can work for other companies, using their trucks to deliver cargo to a handful of cities across Europe. You have to obey all traffic laws (I made the mistake of rolling through a red light because I hadn't noticed they were there to be obeyed, and was charged a fine), and you have to deliver the cargo in a timely manner. If you damage the truck you're working with, the repair cost is deducted from your pay. The time you have to finish the job is also pretty relaxed--this is no Crazy Taxi, though they do have skill upgrades that allow you access to more time sensitive jobs that pay more for the benefit of a quick job.Speaking of which, yes, you level up in this game, and this is also great. You can level up in different ways such as in fuel conservation, where you use less fuel and therefore save more money, or you can unlock a number of different jobs by leveling up your training in different areas. High valued cargo? Check. Fragile cargo? Yep. All of these give you access to even more jobs from the extensive list you already had, and you're able to pick the jobs that pay more (it's also great to pick jobs where the delivery is in a city you've never visited, so you explore more of the map and see new sights).Control-wise, this game also plays extremely well. At first, my time with the controls was chaotic. I've been using a 360 controller to play, and I tried to mess with too much at once, and ended up getting stuck in parking lots because I couldn't figure out how to reverse (ha). If you want to use a controller, I'd suggest not changing the controls from the standard they pick for you at first. Drive around a bit before you decide to change anything.Moving on, as you make money doing jobs using another company's truck, the bank will eventually contact you and let you know they're offering you a loan. It's enough to buy your first truck, but you'll have to be diligent in making sure you make enough money each day to make your loan payments. With your own truck, you're free to explore the map without a time limit (though you do pay for gas!), finding new truck dealers, farms/factories/cargo drop offs, recruitment agencies, and even future garages that you can buy to expand your grasp in the truck business industry across Europe. Once you work hard at that, the bank will increase your credit limit--allowing you to upgrade your garage if you wish, allowing you to buy additional trucks and hire drivers for you. Driving simulation now gives way to business management, and this is pure enjoyment of the genre here. You have a number of garages you can obtain later on in the game once you have enough money, but at first, you'll just be buying another truck and assigning it to the additional space in your garage, where you can hire a driver to use. You can use any recruitment agency you've found to hire a driver, and from there you can hire them based on their skills and rating. Not only do they also level up, you can choose how you want them to work. For example, I chose to have my first hired driver focus on long distance jobs, since I myself was focused on shorter jobs that dealt with fragile or valuable cargo. Your hired drivers will also improve their rating over time, as they constantly are driving and working to improve their skills, though you have the authority to fire them if you so wish.Last but not least--part of the charm in this game is just driving. It felt great to be driving a truck pulling 16 tons of cargo down the highways of Europe, discovering new cities and fulfilling contracts. I knew that with each job I completed, I was a tiny bit closer to paying off my loans, proving my worth in the industry, and making enough for that next truck or next upgrade. Also, the game has a radio feature, which lets you listen to live streams of a great selection of European radio stations--yes, real stations in real time while driving in a Euro truck simulation--and this is awesome. Last night while playing this game, I was driving my truck to a city I'd never seen before, pulling tons of cargo in the dead of night. Only once in a while would another car drive by because of the time, so I was mostly alone on the road. The radio station was playing some older American rock hits between commercials in another language. I was able to zone out. It was simply beautiful to just drive alone on a highway at night, listening to classic rock. I've never played a game that makes you feel so relaxed, so in awe of everyday things...and I've played thousands upon thousands of games. This game does it right.I can't really say this game surprised me--based on the list of positive reviews, this game is a hit with many. But to think a game named Euro Truck Simulator 2 could be one of those games where you're watching the time get later and later and you think to yourself, ""Just one more, then I'm done, I swear!"" If you like trucks, you will love this game. If you like driving simulation, you will love the game. Heck, if you just enjoy driving like I do, you'll love this game. If you like business management games, you'll love this. If you love games where you start off dirt poor and actually have to work hard toward proving yourself, this game is one of the best you can buy. If you're looking for something you can pick-up-and-play to relax, yeah, this game is that, too. When I bought this game, I had hoped I made a good choice, and my husband kind of made fun of me for the purchase since he knows anything with cars or trucks makes me weak, but when I played it, he kept looking over and saying, ""Wow. I guess I can see why that would be interesting."" And he has zero interest in automobiles and rarely plays simulation games!So, with that said, the long summary comes down to this: this game is awesome for pretty much everyone.			"

												Personal Rating: I love driving my truck!Classic Rating: ★★★★★ETS2 is an awesome driving simulator, it's got many different features and they fit very well together.These are some of ETS2's strong points:● Good playability, easy handling/steering (I'm using an XBOX 360 Controller, but Steering Wheels are also supported)● Nice gameplay: you don't just drive; you can run your own company, hire drivers, take a loan if you need money to buy a truck or personalize it - the game offers many (unlockable) items for your trucks. You also advance in your driver's career, adding skills every time you gain enough XP; those upgrades are needed to take longer trips, carry fragile/expensive/dangerous cargos which let you earn money faster.● You can listen to your favourite music in-game, being it a Streaming Radio or MP3 files.● ETS2 is highly moddable and there is plenty of Mods: I can suggest ""ProMods"" for Single Player and ""ETS2 Multiplayer Mod"" which adds a living layer to the game (only human player are in there).● You can have your favourite avatar and plate, registering at World of Trucks website (they will also give you a free key for a ""Metallic Paint Jobs"" DLC).Some downsides too:● The AI is not the best, sadly. You'll have to pay a lot of attention when driving near crossings or when switching lanes, because the AI drives faster than you and it doesn't care very much about you; a little delay in your maneuver and some car can easily hit you - and yeah, you're the one being fined - always.● Mods: they're cool but you should chose wisely and do not draw the longbow. Some game breaking is to be expected, so always save your game before adding a new Mod. Another problem with them is that if you want to remove any, you'll have to reload a previously saved game and all of your gameplay with that Mod will be just gone; so, again, pay attention while modding.● The game is a little ""heavy"" on Graphic Cards, but I guess that's to be expected.I've got this game on sale, no DLCs, but I'm enjoying it so much - recommended.

												This is a really fun game to play. I have almost 70 hours of gameplay and the game keeps getting better! The DLC for this game is truly amazing. I would say get this game and the DLC for it. This is one of the best simulators for PC!			"

												I think this is one of the best simulators in the world as well as American Truck Simulator. In this game you have a great number of liscensed trucks  which are: Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, DAF, Iveco, Man and Renault. Great Mod Support as well as DLC's. Supports Oculus Rift and TrackIR. One of the best Graphics I've seen. You can get mods in The Steam Workshop. Has Steam Achievements. Quite a lot of European cities and towns to haul different cargo to. You can Customize your truck by your taste. Buy garages and hire workers and grow your Trucking Empire.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is, on the surface, a simulation game about driving trucks. Simple, right? Not as much as you might think. The bones and meat are a driving game, yet it’s so much more than that. It’s making those late night deliveries, driving through thunderstorms, and racing down freeways to make sure those Just-In-Time deliveries are delivered, well, just in time. It’s those situations that take the game to another level. Even when it’s a lazy drive though, the game is still great. In my opinion, the cities are a little bland, but where the game really shines is in the landscapes. Countrysides look fantastic, from the rolling hills and fields of sunflowers to the trees swaying in the breeze and rays of sun illuminating the pavement ahead of you. The game has a lot of content, and does a great job with what it gives you. Driving, doing deliveries, obeying traffic laws, it’s just fun. Of course, that isn’t all the fun to be had…Being only about 4 hours into the game, I can’t speak much about all that you can do, so I’ll just tell you about some of my experiences.  My first experience was in the demo, where I learned how to drive while responding to traffic flow, obeying traffic rules, and even parking a trailer (harder that it looks) in a simple and fun tutorial. My second experience found me being cut off by some jerk during a peaceful delivery, chasing him down at terminal velocity, and then spotting and proceeding to drive through a meadow of sunflowers (so pretty :D), which eventually led to the detachment of my trailer and first ever service call for engine trouble. As fun as the game’s core is, it also teaches you about yourself, and allows you to stray off the conventional path a bit.Sometimes it's fun to follow the rules and soak in the scenery, and sometimes it's fun to be a little unconventional. There's no ""right"" and ""wrong"" way to play this game. It's your game, do what you want, and just have fun. It is what you make it. I'm not going to tell you to buy it, but rather this review's purpose is to influence you into trying the demo, and forming your own opinion. It certainly isn’t the type of game I normally play, but has proven to be a worthy entry in my library. And maybe, just maybe, in yours as well. "

												I originally picked this up on a whim, looking for something else to play using my old wheel.  Got it bundled with Going East DLC during a sale and it immediately eclipsed all my other game playing!It's a different kind of driving game and a relaxing departure from the normal racing or shooting in other games.In addition to Going East DLC, it is definitely worth getting Scandinavia DLC as well as the High Power Cargo Pack.  Not much into the Paint Packs, but can pick up the Metallic Pack for free still.  ;)Nov 2016 update:  They've really done so much with this game and are constantly adding more features.  This continues to be the game I love more than any other!			"

												Really amazing simulator. I bought this game never knowing I'll have so fun with my Logitech Force EX simple wheel. I never played any SCS game and I'm totally in love with their work and hoping they release new map, DLC, maps, etc. I' ve tried many mods (there's a fantastic comunity out there) that makes the game more vivid. It's relaxing to drive over so many places that I only have ideas how to make this game bigger. I' ve payed a lot more to big triple A developers but I can say I feel guilty for having paid only 7€ for the gold edition, at least I think this money will be in good hands with a genuine passionate delevoper SCS is.I have no relationship with SCS, I just want to give my support to what I think is a humble company.Now in my own spanish: OLE, OLE, OLEEEEEEE!!!!Kind regards from Barcelona people!!!

												Those who play this game understand that it is fun, and nobody knows why. But I figured it out. I see what SCS is hiding from us.This game triggers something that usually lies dormant in the human brain. The Truckual Cortex. SCS has found a way to unlock it and make something that seems tedious and awful into a wonderful experience. And they just have to sit back and watch their influence grow.It's spreading.Resistance is futile.11/10 bow to our new euro-truck overlords			"

												Driving a truck can be as engaging and fun as any other game out there, you just need to give it a chance first. A game where the basic concept is simple, you drive your truck from point a to point b, get rewarded with money and continue on with future jobs, but where other simulators fail to hook the player, Euro Truck Simulator 2 manages to do the job right. This is not your average driving a truck simulator, in it you actually get to upgrade your vehicle, upgrade your character, level up, customize almost anything on your truck and even start your own company where you can hire other people to drive your trucks and make money for you. But hey, if you don't feel like doing any of that, there's always random jobs up on the job board from people that have a truck and need you to do a delivery, after you finish the job you return the truck and get your money, nothing more and nothing less, so this way I find it extremely easy to get into and just enjoy.Driving for great distances can sometimes be associated with ""boring"" which is not the case at all here. I find this to be the most relaxing game I have ever experienced, often times playing a couple of podcasts at the radio, sit back and enjoy a long drive, there's nothing like it really and you can't bash it till you try it, trust me. Time in the game is compressed, so for example, a 10 hour drive in real life will be about a 40-60 minute drive in the game, this is for a couple of reasons, but mainly to get you engaged on as many roads as possible, to admire everything it has to offer!

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a breathtaking game unmatched by any other. While driving across beautiful landscapes, manage your business, hire and fire drivers, fully customize your truck, and play through the most moving story any game has to offer. One man, alone, no shoulders to cry on, no crutches to help him stand, must strive to avoid bankruptcy in an unforgiving and realistic environment. The graphics are stunning, the driving is amazingly realistic, and the dynamic environment with moving cars is mind boggling. If the player turns on his blinker to make a turn, there is a chance that the car opposite of him will stop and let him make the turn. And when a player collides with another vehicle or object, the truck actually takes damage that costs money to repair, is deducted from the payment if the damage was done to the trailer. I can't think of any other game with realism as immersive as that. The leveling system is even better then that in games well known for unique and superior leveling systems such as the Call of Duty franchise and the classic E.T. for Atari. It provides this unique learning experienc that you can get no where else, making you feel as though while your character levels up, you gain a certain understanding of the real world. There were a few downsides of the game, though. For example, this game does not give you the experience needed to qualify for a CDL-A, which disappointed me, given the exemplary story and graphics. Also, it does not provide you with a steering wheel or pedal set for the complete Euro Truck Simulator experience. While most game designers wouldn't, I expected this games creators, or artists, if you will, to put themselves where everyone knows they belong: Above the rest of us. All in all, 10/10 must have, with an ending sure to bring tears to your eyes.			"

												I haven't been playing this game for very long, but I am really enjoying it so far and can definitely see many more hours ahead of me soon. ETS2 is a very relaxing, enjoyable, challenging and therapeutic game with so much to do and so many things to achieve. The concept is incredibly simple but as an actual game it works so well, it is difficult to explain why it's so fun, but just is!You start off as a cargo truck driver for hire, doing small or large jobs for money so that you can form your own business with your own fully customisable trucks in a beautiful realistic environment. The cities and routes are not 100% accurate and not as long (that would be ridiculous) but it doesn't matter. There is still hundreds upon hundreds of hours of game play on offer and fantastic scenery all around the developers vision of Europe in this amazing simulator.This time last year, I would have said that I do not understand how a truck simulator could be any fun as ever since I was a child I have questioned the fun factor of simulation games, but I am so glad that I spent £7.50 for the collection (ETS, ETS2, Bus Driver, Trucks and Trailers, Scania Truck Driving Simulator and plenty of DLC for ETS2), an absolutely amazing bargain.  Some of the best money I have ever spent and I have only played the one game of the collection so far!ETS2 is worth every penny, so if you see it even cheaper than it's full retail price pick it up and you won't regret it.

												One of the best games I've ever played and also the best simulator to my knowledge. Relaxing and enjoyable to play. Beautiful graphics and extremely well detailed trucks and physics. Although it's a simulator, it's very easy to pick and play. It controls very well on keyboard but if you can play with a wheel, do it! I recommend this game for anyone who enjoys a good driving game; or just a good game in general. If you had a tough day simply start up the engine in your truck and drive around the beautiful roads of Europe and relax. And if you get bored, just smash into the traffic. lol You can always load a save later at any time. Tons of options to costumize your truck and make it unique are available and SCS (the developers) are always adding new content to keep the game fresh and also fixing any problems they might find.The money you spend on this game will be worth every cent. This is a must have!10/10P.S: There is a multiplayer mod, by the way! Get it for free and show your amazing truck and driving skills to literally thousands of other players. Make friends on the road and drive in convoys around Europe, if you wish! The fun is doubled in multiplayer but also is the stakes. After all, you won't be driving with the AI, anymore. You'll be driving with real people, each with their own mind, ideas and driving skills. Almost like in real life! Except that in here, you won't be sent to the hospital and your truck to a scrap yard if you have an accident. :)			"

												Euro and American truck simulators are currently the best driving simulators in terms of realism.This game provides fun and relaxing gameplay for a decent price, especially while on sale. Many people may think that they'll get bored after an hour into this game but so did I at first. Driving, which obviously is an essential aspect of this game, isn't the only thing that this game consists of. We're talking about making your own company, buying garages and trucks in different countries and hiring people to work for you.Customization is a really big thing in this game too. You may modify your and your workers' trucks in detail. For instance, you can change such non-essential parts like door handles, add more lights, one by one onto your truck, change the interior and even add small accessories. And that's not all that can be done.The environment as well as minor details like signs and road marking differ in each country. That means you'll see plains in Netherlands and hills in Italy. This game also has a weather system and day/night cycle, meaning, you have to stop and rest during a really long trip. Moreover, to spice things up you could try downloading a surprisingly stable multiplayer mod. It's very populated, has organized convoys and events going from time to time.Personal Rating: 9/10 "

												This is one of the best simulator games on Steam. It's definatly my Fave. I have had this game since it's release. I started with Euro truck and moved to ET2, as soon has it was available. All the updates from SCS have been to improve the game, and have little or no impact on the gameplay, other than improvng it. I recently purchased the going East map mod. I also have an add on map mod , Scandinavia. Plus a few more mods to make the game more enjoyable. SCS is working onAmerican Trucker as soon as this is available I will install.  Has my location is Western Canada. I find it most enjoyable to drive around Europe, Especialy the UK, has I was born there. Immigrated when I was 11 years old. I have just recently joined SAS Transport Ltd, this is a great group, molst of the timr you will find me on teamspeak in the SAS lounge. So if you have the game, and teamspead drop in and say hi.

So far I have drove through Amsterdam, London, Manchester, Carlisle, Paris and many more. But, I am yet to discover everything.

												(EDIT - NOMINATED FOR 2016 STEAM AWARDS in the category of TEST OF TIME !!!!!)It's a great game with nearly infinite replay ability, and amazing Mods developed by its huge player/support community.  Face it! With almost 98% thumbs up, approval rating, this game has earned it.  SCS had done a great job here with ETS2, and has even improved the platform with the slowly expanding ATS spinoff.  With over 55k Positive reviews, there isn't much new to say, eh.MMO is not directly available thru the SCS game, but can be achieved through other means, though I stick to the Single Player, and couldn't be happier with the game.  Also, some players use keyboard only to play the game (poor devils), but I can't imagine getting through it without a few accessories.  I play at a desktop with the Steering Wheel & Pedals connected, Keyboard to the left side, Mouse to the right, and XBox360 Controller right next to Steering Wheel, for all of the various functions right at your fingertips.  It was all stuff I already had from playing over the years, and it works together great.  Go to You_Tube & see actual truck console rigs that some have built with working gauges, buttons, knobs, actual turn-signal stalks with multiple controls built right in - amazing - and I'm sure Expen$ive - LOL.  Some players even have headsets that IR track so that onscreen camera movements follow where the player/driver looks - amazing stuff yes, but, all too rich for my blood.  Ahhh, to have infinite disposable income - any gamers dream come true!!!Also, while you're driving down the highway, you'll want music to listen to, right?!  The game has a built in feature allowing you to listen to your own music right from your computer (boring), OR, ...Wait for it.... you can actually dial in live radio stations from around the globe.  What's more realistic than dropping off a delivery in England, Germany, etc., and listening to an actual station from that area, or that exact city?!I've played this for years, where I'll get into it intensely for a month or two, then lay-off and emersively play other stuff, then come right back to ETS2 over and over.  All of the continuously developing Mods you can easily plug into the game can make it a new & different experience every time you turn the key.This game can be as Real as you want to make it.  Like the kid (Mikey) in the old TV commercial used to say - ""Try it!  You'll like it!!""Cheers			"

												Totaly amazing, I didnt think i would like it, it has proven me wrong 100 times over. The graphics are amazing, specialy with a high end spec pc. The game play is smooth, i have to mention about some silly features, ie getting a fine for driving with no headlights on in rain.This game is worth every penny, and every minute of your time..Its like marmite, you either love or hate it. If they continue on this level for future simulators, they will be the very best..Ps: if you dont get this game, youl regret it, have a look on youtube, like i did.. Im sure the next button you will be pressing is purchase.			"

												I have over 3 million miles in real world semi's in 3 countries. I have driven just about every type of truck, hauled most types of loads, and did so for nearly 18 yrs. Since being forced into early retirement for medical reasons. I have tried every truck simulator out there, looking for a means to keep my skills sharp. Though this is based in Europe and it's primary focus is on COE's. This is the most realistic semi/ truck simulator out there. The world dynamic's are the most true to life I have ever seen. The shifting actually behaves like it should in a real truck. This is by far the best truck simulator out on the market. Can't wait for one to be done for America and Austrailia.In no other truck simulator out there, could I drive from the 1st person view. This one I haven't had to take it out of it. The views are spot on, the feel that comes thru is fantastic. All you need is a real truck cab mockup, a vibrating device tied to the engine noise, rumble strips and with a large enough screen, it's doubtful you would realize this was just a game enviroment. The only downfall I have found, the engine noise level inside the cab is way too low. I'm used to being able to drive by the sound without gauges, because of this I have to look from time to time. Generally I find this to be a worthy value and a great trainer aid. I am glad I found this simulator here on Steam. I'v also added some DLC mods as well as other mods that expand the map, trailer types and cargo. Makes it much more to life. But ETS2 is still a great starting point on its own.  Highly recommend.

												Euro and American truck simulators are currently the best driving simulators in terms of realism.This game provides fun and relaxing gameplay for a decent price, especially while on sale. Many people may think that they'll get bored after an hour into this game but so did I at first. Driving, which obviously is an essential aspect of this game, isn't the only thing that this game consists of. We're talking about making your own company, buying garages and trucks in different countries and hiring people to work for you.Customization is a really big thing in this game too. You may modify your and your workers' trucks in detail. For instance, you can change such non-essential parts like door handles, add more lights, one by one onto your truck, change the interior and even add small accessories. And that's not all that can be done.The environment as well as minor details like signs and road marking differ in each country. That means you'll see plains in Netherlands and hills in Italy. This game also has a weather system and day/night cycle, meaning, you have to stop and rest during a really long trip. Moreover, to spice things up you could try downloading a surprisingly stable multiplayer mod. It's very populated, has organized convoys and events going from time to time.Personal Rating: 9/10 "

												Surprisingly fun and addictive game. Once you build up your character's attributes you can make bank. Some of the deliveries can be 1,000+ km/miles. Just turn on the radio or listen to your own manually added tunes and enjoy the ride. You can purchase multiple trucking locations and hire drivers for each of them who in turn make money for you as they complete deliveries. There are a good number of truck manufacturers to choose from and plenty of options and upgrades, not to include DLC which further enhances upgrades. This game has quite a bit of replay value and much of that comes from the devs who continually provide updates and the modding community who tirelessly provide worthwhile mods. Get busy and start building your trucking empire!			"

												Driving Trucks around Europe. That sounds a bit boring but hey, first give the game a try.With the ""simulators"" trend growing insanely (have a search on the store) and most of them becoming a true joke (have a search on Greenlight), you would expect this game to be incredibly bad programmed and to have graphics from 2002. BUT let's have a look at the definition of ""simulator"" on the dictionary:A piece of equipment that is designed to represent real conditions, for example in an aircraft or spacecraftGrass simulator, Goat Simulator, Surgeon Simulator and all that are overcrowding the store granting a wrong idea of what a simulator actually is. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a seriously made simulator.What do we find when we get our hands on the game? First thing up, an amazingly huge amount of truck parametres to set up. Damn, every single thing you can control in a real truck is there and you can set them to fit your rig's capabilities.Then, the graphics. Although textures at some point are not as you might expect them to be, graphics detail is pretty decent if you set brightness and gamma to make the signals and road lines clearer. On the controller field, any input is comfortable. I play with pad (xbox 360 controller) and it works well. As there are many parametres to take care of while driving, the more complex your rig is the better, but the devs had a nice touch with non-wheel users and you can mix even three kinds of input to work simultaneously. For example, you can drive with a pad and control the GPS and deeper truck options with the keyboard.AI is... erm... well, it's AI. On such complex game with hundreds of roads and signalisation it is a challenge to make a proper-working AI. The thing is that AI is right, but it lacks interaction with your truck. No matter you have your indicators on they will smash into you at insane speeds (speed limit doesn't seem to be valid for them...) and €400 ticket for you. The game then will catch you on. It even has radio (!) which you can set with your local music. Driving around is relaxing and, although the cities you can drive to don't include the real life spots, it makes you want to drive to every single of them to bag some mileage in. Another good fact is that the game is constantly updated and the devs are including enhanced sounds, new cities, and new trucks quite often.9/10			"

As a total noob to the game I chose the easiest mode and am enjoying trying various trucks used in jobs across Europe. So far I have drove through Amsterdam, London, Manchester, Carlisle, Paris and many more. But, I am yet to discover everything. I feel like I am going to sink many hours into this game and I reccomend you do the same. It takes a certain type of person to enjoy this game and if you think you are one check it out right now!

Luckily, I decided to try it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised - big time!

												This is a game about trucks and to be honest that sounds pretty dire. Add to that the word ""Euro"" which evokes memories of well built and efficient roads. Yet this game somehow defies any logical conclusions you could make from the title and manages to be fun and interesting too. Being a trucker wouldn't be great and this game takes out the worst bits of being a trucker (porn mags and diarrhea inducing foods) and puts in the best bits (trucks and also radio). Stick on an internet radio station and deliver cyanide from london to amsterdam - time will fly by as well. Dangerous timesink. Good trucking.			"

It is pretty self-explanatory - you drive a truck, and deliver goods.  I listen to my favorite podcasts in the background.   Just relax, take your time, and enjoy the pleasure of driving.Even after nearly 200 hours, there's nothing like driving out of the ferry port in Sweden... seeing that early morning sunrise... pulling into the service station and imagining drinking a hot cup of coffee...10/10			"

												Excellent game some real good mods available glad to see game on steamHiWell i thought it was time to re-visit this review the original review was very brief and written in Jan 2013Euro truck simulator 2 would have to be one of my favorite games of all time the game now has the following it deserves im glad SCS has hit the big time with this game i got this game as per-order the only per-order i had no issues with my hours are not very well reflected on steam i original had it off steam.Graphics: Overwhelming good weather its modded and unmodded it gives off realistic feel and they are always improving them which is great to and by far the best graphics in a simulator in my mind but the great thing is they can be turned down so you can play on low end system if you wanted to me i run 3 screens and run graphics at max with no issues.Only thing i feel is missing is skid marks from brake lock up and smoke and skidding sound would be great addition.Controls: The controls are another great feature and SCS has pretty much taking care of every one from key board and mouse to different brand wheel and pedal combos and every other variety available i currently have a simulator rig which has a Logitech G27 wheel and shifter but i run Fanatec pedals this works well with ETS2 after bit of playing around in the settings to find your comfort Zone but the load cell does make it difficult as it feels like ETS2 does not recognize it.Game-play: Well the game-play is virtually never ending and running your own company can get very busy especially when you have alot of different drivers working for and trying to maintain there skill points trucks and delivery's plus driving yourself as well i think all in all this is a great concept with plenty of ways to play weather you want to run solo or have team of truckers working with you.Content: how to explain this with out talking for hours the world is your oyster i guess weather you stick to SCS original game content and use there DLC which are available here on steam or you combine there DLC with the many many mods available through the many fan sites with this only it makes the game feel fresh.With mods please use a test profile as SCS does to offer support for modded games which i understand and agree with i have a test profile and my main profile my main profile is heavily modded and is my same profile from the first day i installed ETS2 which shows if your careful you can have great experience.Physics: These are very surprising and realistic creating an accurate simulator in your home is not easy but ETS2 gives a very good sim feeling with you play on you sit in sofa or desk chair or sim rig to play you can feel every bump twist and turn with great immersion factorOverall this is a great game i personally recommend it to any sim fan or truck fan even if its not your normal style of game i recommend trying it out its great fun.PROS: excellent graphics, excellent controller support, excellent price, lots of content and game-playCONS: can be difficult to find comfort zone with load cell brake pedal ,no skid marks smoke or skidding sounds			"

												Euro truck is an interesting game. The first time i played it, i didn't understand it. After playing it some more, i realised that it is one of the most engaging games i have played. For me, driving in a truck for countless minutes on end was quite boring but the deeper you go, the more there is to it. Leveling up and earning cash became more and more rewarding. As you begin to build up a fleet of trucks and drivers, the game becomes more exciting and engaging. Building a company and driving long distances is really what this game is about. If you enjoy the game you will probably try to install mods, addons and large maps that can sometimes even be a whole country. They have also added a radio in the game that can give you actual live music from real stations around the world! Its a sensible game with a user-friendly interface that anyone withought any previous trucking knowledge can play around with. Now to the negatives... The AI is just unbearable, having to bear with stupid drivers is a huge let down and ruins the realism the game tries so hard to deliver. [This will probably be updated in the near future so dont worry too much] Cargo choices are quite broad but the game somehow chooses to give you the same load frequently. One of the largest flaws of the game is head turning, i say this because everytime you look right or left at a turn. As a result you won't be able to achieve proper speed of decision-making. Although there are many more flaws, they are mostly tiny and you usually wont realize them.I guess what i am trying to say is that it has great potential as a game directed towards very particular group of gamers and the team (consisting of only afew people) have put a great load of effort into it. If you ever see this game on a good sale i recomend picking it up and trying it for a few hours.			"

												This game is splendid, the genre of simulation games gets a lot of bad reputation and is generally the laughing stock. Euro Truck Simulator 2 just doesn't care and just became a really good game. If you like driving around, micromanaging your employees, or just like to mess around in simulators it is possible to do so in this.At first I was skeptic and I bought it on impulse but at the point of writing this I have played more than 50 hours driving around Europe, every country really is a unique experience with a lot of details added to the side of the roads making you feel like you're really there. I thought it wasn't true untill I hit some areas I've been too in my past although sometimes the road was a lot shorter than in real life, it still really felt like I was there, looking around from my truck, in the mountains, over the bridges and through the forests, the view takes your breath away. If you just like traveling, this game really gives a good experience of traveling with a truck.I really have to mention the roads, they are different everywhere, whereas in the UK you'll find a lot of roundabouts and you drive left, when you cross the pond by ship or train, you get on roads that are really specific to the countries, in the Netherlands for example you have these roads with orange browny sides that are meant for bicycle riders, in Poland you get roads that are a bit broken left and right, they are a straight contrast. Not to forget the different gasstations on the sides of the road, the tollhouses for tollroads, the bordercrossings, they all have a lot of variaty, the cities difer a lot. The truck handling really feels, when you drive without a trailer it feels like you're weightless, you pull up so fast and you corner so nicely, put a trailer behind it and it is the opposite. Depending on the weight of the trailer, it can be really heavy, trying to get up to speed can be a drag with those weights and trying to race the corners can be a large accident, you really feel like you're heavy when you have a trailer behind you. The things you can transport also make a difference a whole lot of difference, sometimes you transport bottom heavy diggers of 25 tons and you just feel you got a lot of grip in the corners, but then the next time it is sand which is heavier in the center of height, and you go through a corner at a medium pace and you start tipping, you just know right there that the next corner you can't go as fast anymore. The difference between two trucks is also noticable, every truck is different some have a lot of horse power and torque, whereas others have barely any and need to really pull their strength to get up a hill. If you go to a garage to repair your truck you can also upgrade it and customize it, making it even better than before.The games controls are also good, though lacking controller support, it has support for steeringwheels and joysticks. It for example does support the sticks on my controller but it does not support any of the buttons, though this can be solved with things like xpadder, it would still add a lot to the game if it had native support.I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy trucking it really has the full experience.

The truck handling really feels, when you drive without a trailer it feels like you're weightless, you pull up so fast and you corner so nicely, put a trailer behind it and it is the opposite. Depending on the weight of the trailer, it can be really heavy, trying to get up to speed can be a drag with those weights and trying to race the corners can be a large accident, you really feel like you're heavy when you have a trailer behind you. The things you can transport also make a difference a whole lot of difference, sometimes you transport bottom heavy diggers of 25 tons and you just feel you got a lot of grip in the corners, but then the next time it is sand which is heavier in the center of height, and you go through a corner at a medium pace and you start tipping, you just know right there that the next corner you can't go as fast anymore. The difference between two trucks is also noticable, every truck is different some have a lot of horse power and torque, whereas others have barely any and need to really pull their strength to get up a hill. If you go to a garage to repair your truck you can also upgrade it and customize it, making it even better than before.The games controls are also good, though lacking controller support, it has support for steeringwheels and joysticks. It for example does support the sticks on my controller but it does not support any of the buttons, though this can be solved with things like xpadder, it would still add a lot to the game if it had native support.I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy trucking it really has the full experience.

												Epic game! For those who really likes the process of neat and correct driving. The game has no story, just skills to develop as you and your truck empire grow, but this makes the game even more playable, as you don't have to waste time runnig through the plot and can just sit and drive.I've got the game during summer sale just for fun, just to see how interesting can it be and how good the driving simulation in the game, and I can say that everything is perfect.Graphics and physics are outstanding. Eagerly waiting now for American Truck Simulator, while I have lots of uncovered roads in Europe :)I think this game will be faved by all real drivers. Awesome.			"

TLDRETS2 is a great game if you enjoy simulators and are looking for a career game with simulation, management and vehicles.  With a thriving community, engaged developers, countless mods and seemingly limitless customization it's a dream game for vehicle sim enthusiasts.  Add to this a new meta game experience with World of Trucks and it adds an additional layer of achievement for those who are dedicated to the game.  Low entry price point, very fair DLC pricing and potentially hundreds of hours of replay for fans make this game one of the best values on the market.A Shining ExampleToday's gaming market is significantly different than it was ten even five year ago.  In the past, we'd always have to go to a retail outlet to purchase our games and in most cases were stuck with whatever we got.  Today, we have no end of possibilities for our gaming pleasure but often our choices are mediocre or still in development.  Indie titles, early access, kick starter and other avenues have opened up limitless options for us not only to play but to purchase.  Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) is a poster child for how this economy should work and thrive.  With a very easy point of entry at a regular price of $20 it's an easy game for most folks to get into that delivers substantial replay to it's core audience just in the base game alone.  In addition, players can spend whatever they want to add content, customizations and more to their experience.  Combine that with a thriving modding community and you can customize the game until your heart is content.  To highlight these points:Easy entry level price point with no additional recurring costsVery fairly priced DLC that allows players to pick and choose what options they desire and expand their game play options significantlyCountless mods that compliment the existing official content allowing enthusiasts to fine tune their experienceA four year old game that is still winning awards with developers that are still delivering great content updates to this dayIntegration with World of Trucks which creates a new meta game that integrates with American Truck Simulator allowing players to see all of their stats, share screenshots and earn additional rewards as well as participate in ongoing promotions[/*]Very solid gameplay mechanics that allow for a great simulation experienceGraphics that have aged well and still give the game a very high quality feelBeautiful landscapes that actually make it difficult to stay focused on the road while you're drivingDedicated developers that seem very engaged with their community and appear to take feedback seriously and try to deliverAvailable demo to allow players to determine if the game is right for themConcerning gameplay, this isn't just a game where you hop in a truck and drive trailers around from point A to B, rinse and repeat.  While that is one of the fundamental mechanics, it is not all there is to the game.  On top of the truck simulation is a management simulation in which you create your own trucking empire by purchasing garages, hiring drivers and purchasing trucks for them.  Completing jobs earns you money and experience which can be used to acquire new trucks, upgrades and skills.  This combination allows you to take on more jobs and earn more money for you and your employees.  Not only can you customize your truck and skills but also those of your employees.  That being said, if you want to just grab a truck and make a delivery, you can do that by taking Quick Jobs and earn money and XP in a truck that doesn't belong to you.But it isn't just happy driving to earn easy cash.  The default configuration of the game is setup so that you can get speeding tickets, get tired and if you do not rest you incur fines, can have major loss of cash if you cause an accident and you must also continually upkeep your truck.  But, if you want a more relaxing experience most of these features can be disabled allowing you to just happily truck along with no worries.  Additionally, if the default gameplay experience isn't what you desire then you can not only change the options but can find mods that will further allow you to enable, disable or add more challenging features.So this all sounds great so everyone should play it right?  Not necessarily.  Before I played ETS2, my initial impression was ""Why would anyone want to play a game like this?  It seems so boring and tedious…""  Well, that can be the take away for some.  While ETS2 is a large sandbox for truckers it's not a sand box where players can have a lot of fun just running trucks around and causing havoc or just freely grab any truck they want just for the sake of doing so.  This game emulates a truckers career and requires time and dedication to persevere.  For some, it will simply be too boring…but that doesn't mean it deserves negative criticism.  Part of the issue here is that the phrase ""Simulator"" being added to game titles these days doesn't mean what it once did.  In a market where a game that simulates the life of a goat translates into countless silly YouTube videos, the term has lost some of it's original meaning.  Another example, Shower with Your Dad Simulator.  While there is nothing wrong with those games, they do blur the lines of what a traditional simulator game once was.  So if you expect nothing but silliness and mayhem or free roaming bliss, keep searching, this definitely isn't the game for you.So in closing, ETS2 can be one of the best values for your gaming dollar is this is the type of experience you're seeking.  If you are on the fence, download the demo and give it a try, you might be very surprised (as I was) at how much you actually enjoy it.  SCS has done a magnificent job with this game and in my opinion should be the model for other developers to follow.			"

												""Truckin' was never that fun before!""When I've started Euro Truck Simulator 2 for first time, I knew I won't be dissapointed. How could I be? It's SCS Software. They never dissapoint.  As everybody else I had my worries, but as soon as I've bought my truck and started driving it, all my worries were gone.This game is AMAZING. What shines here are the possibilities. You can hire drivers, expand your business to other countries, buy new trucks, upgrade them, you can level up yourself, you earn money... there is a lot to do. You start as a driver without truck and need to do a quick job. So you hop onto borrowed truck and off you go. After certain amount of time you will earn enough money to get your first truck. The true pleasure starts when you actaully do free roam across europe. You can visit lots of cities, including Warsaw, Poznan, Berlin, London etc. There is a lot of them in game, and all of them contain their recognisable landmarks which adds to the overall immersion of the game. The only complaint I could have towards cities is their size. Often they have 3 to 4 roads, but other than that they are nicely looking. Outside of cities you have beautifull enviroments, rich with details. Sometimes you'll encounter a road works where you can observe workers doing their job, you can see planes landing and taking off from big airports or just observe traffic. Ai is improved from ETS1. They actually pay more attention to you and other drivers, hell, when you use high beam lights, they will flash to you to inform you about that. It's a nice touch, and I love it. Graphically speaking game is beautifull. I mentioned oustanding map and it's enviroment (plus map is AMAZINGLY HUGE). Truck models are made with huge attention to detail, so are traffic cars and other models. Truck interiors are incredibly well done and well detailed. I love looking at sunset, it's just amazing, the amount of colours, those sunshafts... Just wow. Sound-wise game is great aswell. Trucks sound realistic, they have their real engine sounds, but I think that in interior camera, outiside sounds are too quiet. Overall sound is nicely done but has it's flaws. Game has lots of options to choose from, you can even disable built in speed limiter. Optimisation could be a little bad when using outside mirrors, but that is subject to change because SCS is still improving game by adding new free trucks and some paid DLC's, which are definetly top notch quality as the game is (Going East!). Tuning is strong part of the game. You can improve not only engines, but also design of truck by installing grills, more lights, beacons, chromed mirrors etc. There is a lot to do for someone who loves to customise their vehicle. You can literally make a christmas tree out of your truck!Physics are improved. Trucks doesn't ""float"" on road anymore, they have weight, and thank god the cabin has it's own suspension too. I like that you can use mouse to steer the truck, but Xbox 360 controller after configuration works flawlessly. Game supports all common steering wheels without any problem.Game does not contain multiplayer.Thing worth mentioning is that game is moddable. Lots of mods (maps, trucks, Ai, physics mods, interior mods) have been released, and there is even more. SCS supports modding which is great, and they are improving this game by adding new trucks for free.Overall game is worth asking price without doubt. Truckin' was never that fun before, even in Rig'n'Roll. It has everything: customisation, advanced tuning, lots of trucks, business to expand, loads of cities to visit, and discover, drivers to hire... What are you waiting for? Go get it! Your truck business will not build by itself...9/10			"

												I never really understood the hype about simulator games, but then i met this game. Although I play this to only a small fracture of its fullest potential, i more than enjoy every minute on it. I play this with a XBOX360 controller and on medium settings! Hell, I don't even have a driving license.Despite not playing it the way it was designed for, the game brings me nothing but joy and inner peace. Just having a casual ride with your favorite music while expanding your emperium has never been so relaxing!			"

												For few year old game, it's pretty impressive getting support like this. Awasome game play. Need some improvements over boring road structures, most of trucks doesn't feels heavy as they should be. Music player sounds like it's coming from another dimension-it would be better if music can be heard if as playing inside truck. Need more tire variants too. Great customizations to trucks on how they looks, but not with performance modifications.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the most enjoyable sims I have ever played with a superb balance of fun and realism combined with a well-deigned career mode. The game isn't complicated in the slightest which enables you to pick up and play straight away without worrying about minor attention to detail that in other simulators you may have to adhere to.  This game provides a realistic experience but retains the fun which is a major factor for its success. The presentation is simple but slick with a well organised menu and beauitiful visuals.  The trucks look fantastic as do the other vehicles and weather effects.  The world map covers Great Britain and a large part of Europe on a watered-down scale which is a truly excellent accomplishment considering how big this game is regardless of being scaled down. You can go from Edinburgh to Warsaw in under an hour but this helps keep the gamer interested and allows you to complete several jobs in a single session.  The career mode sees you starting off a truck business from scratch where you are presented with a rundown shack as a base. You need to raise money to buy your own truck to further your bank balance or you can just grab a loan to kickstart your venture off with that extra bit of captial.  You can improve your base, customise and improve your truck, buy new vehicles from numerous real-life manufacturers and hire staff to enhance your growing company. You can rank XP to unlock extra items from new engines to even extra mirrors and minor truck accessories.  You also have a skill tree to unlock more lucrative jobs and longer distance trips.The driving side is absolutely fantastic from manual to auto controls, filling up petrol, taking a rest, speeding fines and crashes. Everything is there that you'd expect. You can even be penalised for a late delivery. All these factors add to the challenge and ensures that you don't take crafty shortcuts in trying to complete your job.  The sleeping and fuelling element also adds some tactical spice to the game so you have to plan some jouneys beforehand else you may have an accident or breakdown which can lead to penalties such as fines or unnecessary expenditure. Overall this game is a perfectly balanced sim that isn't overly serious but is executed superbly so it appeals to all gamers who enjoy driving experiences. The excellent presentation and learning curve makes this instantly playable with a well-designed career mode and brilliant driving physics.  Definitely the best simlator out there and highly recommended.			"

												I just love trucking around Europe. More so because I was actually there numerous times throughout the numerous years, and in many areas. It was nostalgic when I was able to venture around the Slovakia area (Bratislava) to see SCS adding in all the cool detailing both in the scenery & the trucks themselves. Lots of fun to be had in this game, even if it is a trucking sim. Quite neat how you choose jobs by borrowing other company's trucks to then get your own, customize them, and expend your trucking Empire by both yourself & varying skilled drivers for hire. It's even sweet when you can listen to the radio from Europe as you truck around.There's lots of details, more being added with each coming upate.Pros:- Scenery details: It's simply overly beautiful. Cities are well crafted, just out of your reach. You can visit & admire the view, just that everything is treated like a 'back-drop'. Lots of detail & attention was put into everything.- trucking experience: It's amazing when you're trucking while being able to haul goods. The feeling of having to be cautious, signaling, not hitting the curb, and having to turn on thel lights. Lots to pay attention to & get into habit-mode. Even being able to customize & such.- Truck detail: Cabin shaking on bumps, the GPS, the horn, the way they sound, run, and operate. It's all interesting. Even the ability to buy & customize them.Ai reactions (blinkers): Previously cars & vehicles did not react to your signaling & presence. Thanks to one update they now do, and even honk when they see you as a pest. They give way when you signal, and they're aware of your presence.Needing to stop at red lights: It's sweet how you have to stay at a red light. It get penalized when you don't, and you also are forced to kick that Grand Theft Auto habit of running lines to stay professional. Stay within the speed limit or get fined....There's speed traps.Repair:: Even though there's no real damage, you do however have to repair from normal or AI stupidity. You have ot keep repairing from normal wear & tear, or else risk stalling & crippled on the side of the road needing to call a taxi.Photography: Love the whole photography bit of taking & saving images. It makes the game more fun with the fun side-things you're able to do. I was able to spam my gallery with them from my journies around Europe. Constant updates: The game is always updating, and something that keeps me drawn to the game. The more it updates the more willing I""m willign to stay to see what's new. I love seeing new ""small"" features being actual ""big"" ones to enjoy. It added the whole ""AI interaction"" when you blinker.- There's even more that I just want to list. That awesome feeling of exploring, seeing you & your drivers level, while also seeing the constant updates. Even the nice little features of monuments, war museums, planes flying, ships sailing, and guys cycling. Nice trains even coming & going at random. Cons:- Repair Bill: You're always penalized when the AI is at fault. Always finding myself cursing when I dent or get cut-off by these AI ""greedy"" drivers. They do react to you, just ignore everything else. - Back-drop Cities: It's a real shame that the cities in ETS2 behave simply like a place to go with landmarks being cut-off. Take Bratislava for example with how you can't go on the ""UFO Bridge"" (Novy Most), or with how Frankfurt & Paris both push you away from such. [Fixed in ATS, or so mentioned by devs].- Invisible & 'lazy' Drivers: It's a real shame you can't see your own hired drivers with their own customized vehicles. Even if it's simulated, then pops up briefly for you to see. It bothered me how your hired drivers didn't bother to go trucking to a neighboring town or city to try and get a job back. This was a forced ""low economic"" feature that irritated me the most. They're intelligent & capable of improvising their way back since I was able to do the same.- No Multiplayer: No official, though there is a nice 2nd party type. It's awesome when you finally do managed to play on there. ATS needs to make note of this to also find its way into ETS2.Even so, this game is awesome. I love it, and still would play it with how much fun it is simply driving out accomplishing tasks. That feeling of detail alone is what is wanting me to come back in. European made games are so rewarding and so much fun. They know where the fun is at.			"

												Much more realistic than the first game. Cars and trucks will pull out in front of you, not giving a single d4mn just like in real life. Plus the 'grafix"" are highly improved, which makes the scenery more enjoyable to look at.That's all I can say really. Other than being able to drive xXxMLGGN0sc0p3720ladderstallxXx trucks, there's not much else to do, but I knew that already and it's exactly why I bought it.			"

												I didn't want to apply a thumbs-down because this is a game that achieves a fair bit of what it set out to do, and is obviously a labour of love. Nice day/night changes, a peaceful feel to it, a chance to listen to MP3s in a fairly stress-free game, comfortable controls. It took me a while to get it set up, but I was soon chugging up hills at 15 mph.I think my main disappointment was to do with expectations. The blurb says: ""dozens of cities to explore"". I didn't expect 1-to-1 fidelity, but to me, explore means at least they would feel like cities, and be vaguely recognisable. Much as I'd have loved it to be like driving through Google Street View, I had already scaled back my expectations. I assumed maybe cities would only have a third of the roads, something like that. I wasn't prepared for reaching Cardiff, a city I know well, and discovering that it seemed to be two roads and a depot. Likewise with Swansea. Ouch. I'd persuaded my girlfriend that we might be able to drive from our hometown across Wales, then on to Europe, and eventually down the coast of Italy, perhaps finding the town where some of our family live. Wrong. The vast majority of places in each country are missing. A few cities will exists as just a couple of roads, nothing like what you'd expect from Saints Row/GTA/Sleeping Dogs. Don't get me wrong, that would be great but I understand why things have been scaled down - I just think it's deceptive not to make that clear from the sales blurb. If that had stated that there were 40 urban areas out of the many thousands, and that cities were scaled down 1,000 times, and that places with populations of below a million weren't included, I'd have at least had an idea of how far the game is from reality. For example, the UK alone has 69 cities (and many thousands of towns and villages) but ETS2 only has 18, each of which is a few roads. Cities mainly act as just blobs on a map, connecting points. A grand tour of Europe this is not - it's a patchwork quilt edged by invisible walls (well, you can see them, big Xs and chevrons floating in the air to stop you heading towards landmarks or B-roads or anything that isn't a motorway). The map of Italy seemed to cut off at the very edge - so technically Italy is included, but only as a few clumps of road in a teeny area. It seems disingenuous. Most European countries don't seem to be in the game. This is a disappointment only because of the misleading advertising.It seems you can listen to radio stations in game but I never got that to work, no matter how many URLs I added to a text document nested far down my hard drive hierarchy. No error messages - good luck if you aren't IT literate.Finally, I think I'd have got a bit more pleasure from it if I could have also had the option of driving around in a car rather than a truck. It's weird that the game simulates many things; as a company owner you probably have a car, but there is no option to go anywhere in it. I'd have thought a free drive mode would have been a nice addition for people like me, who don't want a racing game, just something more sedate, but the chance to explore the small part of Europe that has been included at a bit more of a zippy pace. Still, that's a suggestion, not a criticism. The main feeling I had was one of disappointment at the scale of the game. It may be hundreds of miles wide, but the detail is only inches deep, a surface impression that didn't really satisfy me. I can see why others might be happy with it. Maybe a more accurate blurb would have helped, rather than trying to sell the Earth.---I can't comment on my own review's comments thread due to some error (thanks Steam), so here's my response to the comment by HaddockA, who said ""You're seriously crazy to even think that such a game in 2016 could even exist... That's like having GTA V multiplied by a factor of 1,000.... you're seriously weird. .""My reply: ""I probably am crazy but that's a separate issue. Having never played one of these games, but having used the free Google Street view which lets you do something similar, I don't see why it was crazy to imagine the game would map 33% of the roads, rather than 0.01% (or whatever the figure is). After all, it says ""cities to explore"". But you get there and there is nothing to explore. Just a few roads, one supermarket with an empty car park, and a background view you can't reach. If the blurb included what % of Europe's roads were included in the game then I'd be a fool to expect otherwise, but they don't include that information, thereby inviting inflated expectations.""

												Awesome driving game. With the multiplayer mod it got even better, extremelly addictive!Its not fast-paced like racing games, its a simulator, but its a somewhat relaxing game with great scenarios all over the europe and its also very rewarding. Buy it if you are into driving games and you wont regret it, it will give you many hours of fun.			"

												Pros:+ Good driving ""feel""+ Multiplicity of trucks, many of them are the real vehicles+ Large map (especially with the expansion)+ Great graphics+ Damages+ Additional and optional management game (buying garages, trucks, hiring drivers) which blends with the main focus of the game and is well madeCons:- Dumb and annoying AI- Damages are not realistic- A bit mind numbing, best played when high, drunk or tired- No multiplayer (unless you use an unofficial mod)Summary:Probably the best driving simulator. I enjoy this game a lot even though I dislike the genre. It's a perfect game to play when you drink alone or return home tired after a day at work/university.			"

												I have never been able to drive a truck in other games.I really liked my experience on learning how to drive a truck with Euro Truck Simulator 2. I was shocked and had to use automatic parking because I was unable to figure out how to park. I started to deliver a few cargos first before attempting to park properly.By the time I was able to upgrade my garage and buy another one, I am already taking deliveries with distances over 1000km. I find it hard to stay alert while driving on straightways, these deliveries now take a pretty long time and get me feeling sleepy (Just like the driver, I will take a nap when he gets to rest). I kept on getting speed tickets, I guess trying to slow down is something that I can't learn.I look forward to taking on more deliveries to expand the company and unlock more achievements. I'll also be trying out the multiplayer soon and will be camping for a sale to buy the Going East! DLC.			"

												Great game. Optimized good. Size of sandbox?, massive. Customization good. Stable, yes. Support and modding community large. Live streaming radio is great with many genres. AI runs decent.Nice way to roleplay management. With the mods availble, and in the quality of it, the game has an endless feel to it. If you enjoy driving with a bit of a challenge, ie; parking and measured turns etc., then here you go. I'm a truck driver by trade so this was a nice turn from my zombie killing days. Get the game if your on the fence.			"

												Really can't explain why or how this game is so enjoyable. It's literally just driving trucks around Europe and delivering cargo. Sometimes the monotous highway driving gets a little tedious but otherwise it's really quite addictive. Physics and graphics are brilliant, the sounds let the game down a little but no enough to detract from the simulator experience. Can eek out 4K gaming on a GTX970, i7 and 16gb ram but it's much more playable at 1440p with a steady 60fps. Make sure you get the DLC maps, they're worth it.			"

												There is something very calming about driving a rig and its load across the vast country side of Euro Truck Sim2. This game is stunning in every aspect. Graphics and the 1000+ km of scenery is breath taking along with its full range of weather makes for a completely realistic feeling (-winter driving they should add it in and hope they do it in the up coming expansion).  There are a Dozen + fully customizable trucks to drive (Performance and Visual/color), with fully detailed truck cabins for the perfect first person experience. Your character also levels up as you complete jobs alowing you to chose which direction you want to take your trucking experience, and Increasing your rewards!You are also given the ability to run and manage your own trucking company, micro managing multi drivers/trucks/garages which also are all customizable and level up.This game is also compatible with wheels and pedles, game pads, and the Oculus Rift/VR. You may also import your music to the in game radio or listen to one of their many online radio stations.If your looking for a sunday driver to enjoy scenery across Europe while hauling a trailer, or looking for a true Trucking Sim, you need this game!9/10			"

Unbelievable Truck Simulator! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]I started my truck driver life in a couple of minutes... In the first road stop, I watched to my left and then to my right for the street to be empty, then passed! No accidents! Then I spent the other 10 minutes trying to park that enormous truck without luck!I got my second assignment, the real one... I had to try to avoid the other cars, I had to slow down on curves, I had to take curves with an eye on my back! Then after a long road on the highway my attention got captured by the near airport and I took the wrong turn, so I had to drive for another 20 kilometers to the next town and turn around.Near the arrival point I said ""who cares about traffic lights"", and passed with the red lights on - I got fined for 350$.When I returned home I got an email from the Volvo seller :/Whoever designed this game is sick!!!IT'S AWESOME!!!Best played with Wheel & PedalRecommended Buy Price < 15$Score 11/10 "

												Cool Truck Sim. This game has a lot of real life effect from tipping over from going to fast to receiving tickets for not obeying traffic laws to having nice real life time lighting and weather. This game is what i would call a good and mature sim. The graphics over all isn't the best but it is one of the best for a truck sim. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants to relax and make believe they are starting trucking from scratch and develope themselves into a business. You earn money by the job and you loose money from damaging the trucks and or receiving traffic tickets. If you would like to play a good single player sim, then this is probably a perfect game for you. I like it and I give it 5 STARS.			"

												Always considered simulators to be a bit of a joke - an autists paradise - until I played this. It's extremely addictive and immersive, from taking a massive road trip from the UK to Poland via Netherlands, to buying and upgrading your truck to look exactly how you want it to. Add a few subtle mods, like realistic handling and weight, to real world fuel prices, and you'd swear you were actually a truck driver. 9/10, would definitely recommend, even if you don't care for trucks or driving simulators			"

												I have some friends that used to play the olds 18 wheels, and I felt strange how they get fun with these games? ""It seems too boring, driving slow trucks for hours..."", it's what I used to think about, and never got inspired to try...Well, some day when I bought a xbox 360 wifi controller to use on PC, I got a cheap steering wheel too, because it's cheap and seems a god thing to improve experience on racing games, like Race 07 (the race sim I most used to play at this time).Two days later, Euro Truck Simulator came in sale in steam, and I think it's affordable. Why not try? If I don't like, it's not a lot of money lost. Surprise myself, I stoped with car racing games and started to play ETS2 every day for almost two or three months!Really love the game! It's very challenging at first to drive and manouver to deliver the cargo, but eventually I was getting better. Never forgot the day I bought my first garage, first truck (one Volvo), and contract the first truck driver.It's a really nice game, it's a pleasure, it's relaxing, Driving day and night, with ou without rain, evolving the trucks, garages and earnings. Listen some cool internet radios in game while driving across Europe countries.2015 january I got a Logitech G27 and the driving experience got even better and pleasure.This simulator is a special gem, definitivelly it worths. I think I can driving these trucks for years without getting bored. Sometimes I stop to play, just to play other games in library or new games, but I allways return to my trucks to do some delivers and continue expanding the company. Waiting for Scandinavian DLC and American Truck Simulator too, no doubt it'll worths too.It's an excelent game simulator, I recommend.  "

												For the first time you play this sim, you'll get in touch quickly with almost everything in normal option. I believe since this is a ""simulator"" game, you should go deeper than what factory setting gave you.Try to use gamewheel, force feedback in this game is pretty awesome, you can tell the difference when you have goods in your back that empty trailer, if you don't have one, mouse steering still give you precision and little of the force feedback you want.every truck has it's own ""fingerprint"", Volvo feed your hunger for power, rather than majestic (or should I say Mercedes) will give you god touch of driving in the city and hill. ridiculous precision of a one's brand for such simulator.Oh! don't forget to learn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ braking and engine braking. And make the rain probability slider in option to go about 40%, rain is rarely happen under that mark, and rain is awesome!try to use ""simulator"" feature as many as you can, sure it'll bring you joy for fancy truck driving.I'm not going to whiny about graphics, but since in this game all you have to do is driving, having a good view of landscape and city is a need.Graphics pretty nice, what makes me impress is ETS2 have widely variant of graphic setting. I still can have nice graphic at my GT520M at my laptop (7/10) and a perfect breeze at my desktop GTX660.Here's a little con you'll find, not that many- sometimes when I go to the left/right, cars from opposite way of me didn't stop even after my truck body is eat up half of the road space. it's a little bit annoying to get -£400- you cannot set how many hours you want to sleep at the truck stop, sometimes I missed the delivery time for some mission because of this.- mouse steering sucks because you can't move your head without holding RMB.It's sure a great sim! be warned for addiction and dreaming become a truck driver.

												Now don't be fooled by the 'simulator' part. This is actually a really, really solid experience.On the one hand you've got a driving simulator, shipping stuff all across Europe on the big road listening to the radio or what have you, which is all well and good on it's own, but the game also has a tycoon bit in it, where you buy garages, hire drivers and equip them with trucks to drive.Leveling up is fast enough that it doesn't feel like too much of a chore to get bigger and better, but slow enough to give the game a good lifetime. Couple that with the tycoon aspect and you've got a long game in front of you, potentially endless if you really like cruising the French countryside on the way to England to drop off a shipment of forklifts while managing a hundred drivers across the continent.The physics are very solid and well-rounded, there's a lot of difference between driving with no trailer, driving with a few tons of corrosive acid or driving with sawdust panels. Try not to go too fast around corners with too much weight, you'll regret it. Turned into a highway into mainland France like 15 minutes away from my drop-off point and I had to call for assistance because I ended up on the side.If you're skeptical, give the demo a try. If you find that you like it, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing it and getting to work on your truck empire.Oh, and I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 has its ups and downs, mostly ups though. The game is basically where you can drive around Europe in a tricked out truck that you can customize. After doing lots of jobs in the jobs market, or just getting a loan in the bank, you can expand by purchasing larger garages and using them to hire drivers who will work for you! The graphics are amazing in the game, as well as the scenery in some of the cities and routes. Downsides? The AI are really dumb as they tend to slow down on turns and speed off all of a sudden, which could potentially cause a collision. Second of all, the physics S-U-C-K! You need to get realistic physics mod before the actual simulation starts. I don't have it but the game is really cool and I would suggest this game to all those of you who just love to go out there and drive trucks and haul loads!			"

												My response to these games is usually ""go truck yourself"" but I find this one oddly compelling and surprisingly good. It's not the expected shovelware♥♥♥♥♥♥quality like most of these go-get-a-real-job-simulators for sale. It's an immersive RPG in the very literal sense of the term (hey, it's also got fetch and escort quests). It's quite unique and soothing to cruise european highways hauling random toxic waste while streaming actual local radio channels. Exploration game meets immersion sim. Kind of like Proteus meets X3.

Basic InformationTitle : Euro Truck Simulator 2Developer : SCS SoftwarePublisher : SCS SoftwareGenre : SimulatorGeneral ImpresionEuro Truck Simulator 2 is a vehicle simulation game. The game is a direct sequel of Euro Truck Simulator and it is the second video game in the Euro Truck Simulator series. The player can drive one of a choice of articulated trucks across a depiction of Europe, picking up cargo from various locations and delivering it. As the game progresses, it is possible for the player to buy more vehicles, depots, and hire drivers to work.Players choose their HQ's location in any of the game map's cities. At first, the player can only take what are known as Quick jobs—these jobs involve making hired driver deliveries while employed by a delivery company, with a provided truck and all expenses (fuel, road tolls, ferry crossings) covered. As the player earns money or takes bank loans, they can eventually afford to buy themselves a truck, acquire a home garage, and start making more money by delivering cargo using their own truck instead of just being a driver for hire. Money earned in the game can be spent on upgrading or purchasing new trucks, hiring NPC drivers to take on deliveries, buying more garages and expanding the home garage to accommodate more trucks and drivers.In my opinion, ETS2 is a good game, but you will become boring after a few races.Strong points+ Multiplayer+ Great optimization+ Great truck costumization+ Too many places + Realistic+ Achievements+ Steam Trading CardsWeak points- Very expensive for what it offers- A lot of countries paintjobs that could be free- You will become boring after a few racesRating6/10 "

Even though I have only 32 hours on steam in this game, I've played the game NON-steam for at least 200 hours before I got it on steam.GameplayThe gameplay of this game is very good. An open world truck driving simulator that's also fun to keep playing, and doesn't get boring after an hour or so. There are some issues with people going from one lane to the other, but I can see through that with the great stuff the game has to offer. A wide variation of jobs, trucks, places to go to and more.DLCI've only played the Going East! DLC a few times, but it's a great DLC to have if you have some extra money to put in the game. All the DLC actually make the map bigger, or give you a wider variation of what to design your truck with, without making the vanilla game stupid and boring. ModsI really like the fact you can use mods to create a more realistic game experience than the game already offers. Mods like putting real brands in the game or even a Multiplayer mod make the experience even better. InterfaceI really like the interface of the game more than any other game. It has that ""truckdriving"" look to it and it's really clean and you can find everything pretty easy in my opinion. Graphics/PerformanceI don't have the best computer in the world (far from that), but I'm still able to run the game on a stable 60 fps with graphics lowered. And with the lowered graphics, the game still looks great in my opinion. Yeah, it's much better with some extreme masterrace pc, but I'm enjoying games on low graphics for a few years now and this is one of the games to add to this list. The menu where you can choose jobs etc. is kinda laggy though. It says I have 60 fps as well, but my cursor moves like it's 15-20 fps. It's not that big of an issue since most of the time you spend in the game, is not spent in that menu but on the road. OverallI really like the game and am definitely recommending it to everyone who likes to have a truck driving experience without actually getting a truck's driving license and buying a truck in real life. Even though there are some small issues, the game is very good and fun to play (multiplayer or single player). The score I'm rewarding the game with is 8.2 out of 10 "

												For the first time you play this sim, you'll get in touch quickly with almost everything in normal option. I believe since this is a ""simulator"" game, you should go deeper than what factory setting gave you.Try to use gamewheel, force feedback in this game is pretty awesome, you can tell the difference when you have goods in your back that empty trailer, if you don't have one, mouse steering still give you precision and little of the force feedback you want.every truck has it's own ""fingerprint"", Volvo feed your hunger for power, rather than majestic (or should I say Mercedes) will give you god touch of driving in the city and hill. ridiculous precision of a one's brand for such simulator.Oh! don't forget to learn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ braking and engine braking. And make the rain probability slider in option to go about 40%, rain is rarely happen under that mark, and rain is awesome!try to use ""simulator"" feature as many as you can, sure it'll bring you joy for fancy truck driving.I'm not going to whiny about graphics, but since in this game all you have to do is driving, having a good view of landscape and city is a need.Graphics pretty nice, what makes me impress is ETS2 have widely variant of graphic setting. I still can have nice graphic at my GT520M at my laptop (7/10) and a perfect breeze at my desktop GTX660.Here's a little con you'll find, not that many- sometimes when I go to the left/right, cars from opposite way of me didn't stop even after my truck body is eat up half of the road space. it's a little bit annoying to get -£400- you cannot set how many hours you want to sleep at the truck stop, sometimes I missed the delivery time for some mission because of this.- mouse steering sucks because you can't move your head without holding RMB.It's sure a great sim! be warned for addiction and dreaming become a truck driver.

												Now don't be fooled by the 'simulator' part. This is actually a really, really solid experience.On the one hand you've got a driving simulator, shipping stuff all across Europe on the big road listening to the radio or what have you, which is all well and good on it's own, but the game also has a tycoon bit in it, where you buy garages, hire drivers and equip them with trucks to drive.Leveling up is fast enough that it doesn't feel like too much of a chore to get bigger and better, but slow enough to give the game a good lifetime. Couple that with the tycoon aspect and you've got a long game in front of you, potentially endless if you really like cruising the French countryside on the way to England to drop off a shipment of forklifts while managing a hundred drivers across the continent.The physics are very solid and well-rounded, there's a lot of difference between driving with no trailer, driving with a few tons of corrosive acid or driving with sawdust panels. Try not to go too fast around corners with too much weight, you'll regret it. Turned into a highway into mainland France like 15 minutes away from my drop-off point and I had to call for assistance because I ended up on the side.If you're skeptical, give the demo a try. If you find that you like it, I wholeheartedly recommend purchasing it and getting to work on your truck empire.Oh, and I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award!			"

												My response to these games is usually ""go truck yourself"" but I find this one oddly compelling and surprisingly good. It's not the expected shovelware♥♥♥♥♥♥quality like most of these go-get-a-real-job-simulators for sale. It's an immersive RPG in the very literal sense of the term (hey, it's also got fetch and escort quests). It's quite unique and soothing to cruise european highways hauling random toxic waste while streaming actual local radio channels. Exploration game meets immersion sim. Kind of like Proteus meets X3.

												I had no interest in trucks.  Now whenever I see one in the wild I get a warm fuzzy glow. I stop and snap a picture of a parked up SCANIA feeling a certain sense of satisfaction -as if I just caught myself a new Pokemon.  After 20hrs I bought a Logitech G27 to give myself more realistic control. Shorlty after, a 21:9 monitor to give me a wider view of the road. Finally I upgraded my graphics to a 780Ti for a bit more Oomph. So basically this is the most expensive game I have ever played. Highly recommended. FYI; SCS are constantly improving the game with free patches, and they blog about it a lot. Just recently they updated the AI and physics. There is also a planned map update coming soon (free). Buy it! Support these awesome devs.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is just one of those games. One of those really annoying games that we all love. To not like this game is foolish, what is there not to like about it? You can launch it thinking ""I'll do one small job and get off, got homework to do"" and at 10pm you are still playing it. Despite all the swearing and crying over all of the times you have crashed and got no money for any of the jobs, it was safe to say that it was time well spent. Euro Truck Simulator 2 pretty much tells you everything about the game before you play it, but also without really telling you about the game. You are a lorry driver. You drive lorries. You get paid to drive lorries over Europe. It is a very hard game to play. No, it really isn't. Basiclly, drive, deliver your cargo and do it all over again without crashing too much. I repeat - too much. It is a challenge, but one that we all enjoy. If you are the type that likes really fast paced killing games with blood and gore, then this game is not for you, and if you can't stop killing people, and sit back and enjoy some lovely scenery and driving, then you are not for this game. I think now we have solved that, we can talk about the game. Funny, what have i actually said about the game so far? Do you want to buy it yet? No? I need to try harder, clearly. 10/10 Driving Simulator. Lovely scenery, very well made game, plenty to do, and no time to do it in. I would reccomend this game to anyone that hates lorries and simulators. This is just your type of game.			"

												Well, it´s a nice driving game and SCS software made a good job, releasing patches and DLC´s and making it better. BUT if you like truckdriving or dreamt of being a truckdriver as a child - this will make you very yery happy,  got myself at least a little addicted to that game. Sadly I´m not talking about the Vanilla game here, which brought me some enjoyment for at least a few month, but about a modded game. And here is where all the magic happens. You will have to figure out which mods fit you the best, but there are some out there which make this game the BY FAR biggest map in video game history ( ProMods20).  Imagine yourself driving a beautiful customized SCANIA V8 across the Autobahn, listening to your favourite music and the powerful crackling of your open pipe exhaust while watching a beautiful sunrise or a dramatic thunderstorm coming up the Skyline of Berlin/Prague/Paris/London/Amsterdam wherever....or cruising along the breathtaking Fjords of Norway and honk your illegal trainhorn at some Prius at the next intersection. I´m in love with this game.			"

It is just such a fun game to play which may sound weird considering all you are doing is driving trucks from point A to point B but it is really engrossing. You can sink a few hours into this game and not care.Also has a bit of a simple management side to it, but most of your time will be spent driving trucks and listening to music. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, pick this game up and see why nearly everyone raves on about it being such a great game to play			"

												Simulators fall into one of three types. One, boring gameplay with nothing enjoyble made by some kid in germany and bought as a joke in the pc software bin at an office store. Two, a joke about number one, an excuse to make a stupid game and then say ""Oh Rock simulator what a laught, ha ha"". Three, an enjoyable game that does what it wants to do. Euro truck simulator is in this group. This game has you play as a man starting a truck empire as you drive around europe driving Weed water towers. The game has a preaty big map even if a few big countrys don't have as many towns in them (I.E France) And the towns are a bit small, only big enought for what needed. I found the game very relaxing, I put on a podcast and then just drive. I really do recomend this game.			"

The locations and cities in this game are a bit of a let down. They are all about the same with the same industries. But, non the less, this is an increadible game which will offer many hours of enjoyment and entertainment.

												I suck at reversing the trailer (even though I'm getting better at it) but that's not the game's fault. There's really quite a lot to recommend in this game, so I'll get to it.Pros1. Very realistic driving simulation, from game pad and joystick support, to manual gear changes, faithful replicas of various brands of trucks, etc.2. Somehow they compress time -- a 4 hour journey can be completed in 30 minutes of real time game play. This was one of the biggest questions I had before buying this game since I didn't want to be stuck at the wheel for hours at a time. I don't know how they do it, but they compress driving time very well, so that you feel the longer deliveries but at the same time don't burn an afternoon travelling a simulated highway.3. Great graphics and physics engine -- rain, cloudy skies, wiper action, water drops on your windshield, headlights, all nicely represented. 4. Some RPG elements included -- running your own trucking business, buying vehicles, hiring drivers, all add a nice touch to what was supposed to be just a sim.5. The most amazing thing to me is: the landscape and the scenery look real! I don't know how they mapped thousands of miles of roads, signs, landmarks, scenery, etc. but they did a damn fine job of it. You really feel like you're in Europe!Cons1. Kind of steep learning curve, figuring out the driving controls/keys, had to keep pausing and checking the game setting options (there are a LOT of functions). I wish this part could be covered in a tutorial of some sort.2. A sandbox / practice mode would have been nice. You literally get thrown into the driver's seat from the start. But I guess some people like jumping in right away, but some like me prefer to have a decent understanding of all the controls first. Although I'm not as good a driver as I want to be, I'm actually having fun (minus the tickets and accident citations)!Recommended!7.5/10.0			"

												PROS:The Gran Turismo of Trucking.You will look at this game's store page and maybe think ""A trucking sim, really? What bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are playing that?"" and move on. But if you are lucky.. really really lucky.. someone will tell you to try it and you will. Maybe you get it on steam sale. Maybe you trade some old gift games for it you have collecting e-dust. Maybe you just say ""I have big balls, and these balls need a big truck"" and you buy the game right now.Whatever the case, once you end up with this in your library - it's all over my friend. You try it. It's more than you thought it would be. Hell, in the first hour or so, you may actually learn or google something about trucks. You get set up. You configure your keyboard and controller. You grab  beverage and hit the road...A week later...You have been driving for days. You sleep in the cab, maybe right in the driver's seat: who knows? Better yet, who gives a damn? You only give a damn about getting just one more haul in. Just one more pure columbian uncut trailer to barrel down the highway with attached to you like hot sexy chicks on your shoulder as you blaze out of hell on a chariot of fire. A chariot that is in fact, your super tricked out Scania-R rig with enough headlights to light up the gamma quadrant of space, and your sweet♥♥♥♥♥thunderbolt paint job. Don't even get started on the mods, your computer is like a truck-simulating battlestar cyclon at this point.As you drive down the road as king, you sing old Hank Williams songs on 181.1 FM and loosen your trucker cap, ignoring all the negatives in the world while people in the background complain that you won't get your laundry out of the dryer. But they don't know; they can't understand you. It's ok, your truck understands you. The road knows you. This is where belong, this is what you are now.CONS:It doesn't have that wicked cool Truck from the film ""Maximum Overdrive"" with the Green Goblin's head on the grill. "

												At first you would think this is a boring game, ain't it? But it's not, it covers the entire concept of hauling very realistically and in-depth! Also it's not that hard for a green-horn to learn the basics of trucking! It's also worth mentioning that the available DLC's are also worth spending, since one of them (maybe more in the future) greatly expands the map by adding new countries and cities! + very nice graphics, and truck tuning! I greatly reccomend playing it!			"

												This isn't yet another shovelware, mediocre ""simulation"" game. ETS2 is an accurate and advanced truck driving sim, with licenced trucks and cars and a beautiful (if very scaled down) version of European roads.Start without your own truck, take quick jobs, buy your first truck and garage, then buy more trucks and hire drivers and grow little trucking enterprise. Unlock better upgrades and skills for you and your team.All of these aspects are great, but for me - and it seems for a lot of people - the best part of the game is just the experience of driving. Discovering all the roads and locations, enjoying the views, navigating the long wide turns and tight corners, pulling off that perfect braking at the red light.Driving at night in the game (and in the real world), listening to European radios online, or your own music collection, both accessible through the in-game music player.There's something soothing and special about driving at night, in the rain, listening to oldies and talk shows on a Czech radio. To me, that's the real joy of ETS2.Even with the next game in the series announces (American Truck Simulator), the developers are still upgrading ETS2 and releasing new content. I'm looking forward to the Scandinavian DLC. It's a good sign when you look forward to a game's DLC.PS. Try with a controller / steering wheel and face tracking. (you can use FaceTrakNoIR, free)			"

												I'm not a gearhead at all by nature, but a friend introduced me to this game and I cannot stop driving my new rigs..:-)  Very well made game, lovely scenery, nice lighting effects, working mirrors and visual dynamics, and very accurate models.  I recommend this simulator to everyone.:-)  I use a saitek flight set up to drive, but friends use keyboards and mice as well and have fun playing..:-)			"

												If you own Eurotruck Simulator 2, then you need to try out Eurotruck Simulator 2 Multiplayer, where you can join convoys and drive with your friends, you can even have a competition with them to get the fastest truck and the biggest money, the only downside to it is there is no AI traffic and you can't employ workers either			"

												This game is one of the best games out there. Not because of the game itself (wich is great!), but because of SCS Software - the best team of developers ever! They add new content to the game all the time, even though it was released years ago! And, most of the new content is free! Can you even imagine that? Besides that, there's a great comunity of players, mod creators and developers hanging out on SCS forums - a place where you can post your ideas for the game, and chances are, you'll see them come to life in one of the next patches. (Mind you, ideas have to be realistic... and there's already a big wishlist there...) ;-)So, buy the game. Even if you don't believe trucking can be fun... Strangely enough - it is. And it's highly addictive. :)			"

												When I heard one of my friends on Steam had bought this game and was having a lot of fun with it, I couldn't believe it. After sinking so many hours into it, I believe them with gusto. It is just such a fun game to play which may sound weird considering all you are doing is driving trucks from point A to point B but it is really engrossing. You can sink a few hours into this game and not care.Also has a bit of a simple management side to it, but most of your time will be spent driving trucks and listening to music. If this sounds like your idea of a good time, pick this game up and see why nearly everyone raves on about it being such a great game to play			"

												Simulators fall into one of three types. One, boring gameplay with nothing enjoyble made by some kid in germany and bought as a joke in the pc software bin at an office store. Two, a joke about number one, an excuse to make a stupid game and then say ""Oh Rock simulator what a laught, ha ha"". Three, an enjoyable game that does what it wants to do. Euro truck simulator is in this group. This game has you play as a man starting a truck empire as you drive around europe driving Weed water towers. The game has a preaty big map even if a few big countrys don't have as many towns in them (I.E France) And the towns are a bit small, only big enought for what needed. I found the game very relaxing, I put on a podcast and then just drive. I really do recomend this game.			"

												Best simulator I played so far.Euro Truck Simulator 2 is that kind of game which steals your time but you wont regret it. The environment is very similar to the real life, making you feel like a real driver. The options are so detailed, that you can control almost every part of your truck. My advice is to buy a steering wheel if you dont have one yet, to play the best experience possible.If you are looking for a truck simulator, ETS2 is the best choice on Steam.			"

												Awesome game! Trucking at it's finest. Hearing about this through youtube, I really liked trying it. I got mine for free from a giveaway, but I think that it is an amazing game. Finding some good truck simulators is hard. Finding good train simulators are even harder. If you like trucks, get this. If you like trains, get TS14. DL Packs are good, and it's pretty nice if you get mods for it. Base is still good, however. And, with the announcement of ATS, I can't wait!			"

												This is a great game with terrific graphics. It runs suprizingly well on my computer (Windows XP 32bit, Athlon x2 250 Processer, 3.00 GB ram) even with the graphics set to high. The locations and cities in this game are a bit of a let down. They are all about the same with the same industries. But, non the less, this is an increadible game which will offer many hours of enjoyment and entertainment. I use a Logitech F310 Gamepad to drive my trucks, but any steering wheel/joystick/gamepad should work well too. I would recommend this game to any simulator/driving fan.			"

												PROS:The Gran Turismo of Trucking.You will look at this game's store page and maybe think ""A trucking sim, really? What bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are playing that?"" and move on. But if you are lucky.. really really lucky.. someone will tell you to try it and you will. Maybe you get it on steam sale. Maybe you trade some old gift games for it you have collecting e-dust. Maybe you just say ""I have big balls, and these balls need a big truck"" and you buy the game right now.Whatever the case, once you end up with this in your library - it's all over my friend. You try it. It's more than you thought it would be. Hell, in the first hour or so, you may actually learn or google something about trucks. You get set up. You configure your keyboard and controller. You grab  beverage and hit the road...A week later...You have been driving for days. You sleep in the cab, maybe right in the driver's seat: who knows? Better yet, who gives a damn? You only give a damn about getting just one more haul in. Just one more pure columbian uncut trailer to barrel down the highway with attached to you like hot sexy chicks on your shoulder as you blaze out of hell on a chariot of fire. A chariot that is in fact, your super tricked out Scania-R rig with enough headlights to light up the gamma quadrant of space, and your sweet♥♥♥♥♥thunderbolt paint job. Don't even get started on the mods, your computer is like a truck-simulating battlestar cyclon at this point.As you drive down the road as king, you sing old Hank Williams songs on 181.1 FM and loosen your trucker cap, ignoring all the negatives in the world while people in the background complain that you won't get your laundry out of the dryer. But they don't know; they can't understand you. It's ok, your truck understands you. The road knows you. This is where belong, this is what you are now.CONS:It doesn't have that wicked cool Truck from the film ""Maximum Overdrive"" with the Green Goblin's head on the grill. "

												This game is simply beautiful and relaxing. Whether or not you are a truck fanatic, you will find driving in this game the opposite of being a chore. Yes, it does get repetitive in the early parts of the game and the whole game is basically driving, taking charge of your own company and more driving. However, the driving is very realistic for the most part and it really makes you relaxed. It actually gets pretty addicting sometimes. It was very very rewarding when I worked very hard and finally got the money to buy my first truck. I would play this anyday just to have a little fun. 8.5/10p.s. saving money to buy a oculus which will prob never happen			"

												I am glad I got this finally. I was wanting to try it for some time.. but with the sale couldnt pass it up.  I drove for a while as a pro. My hat is still off to all the guys / gals that OTR it day in and out. But this... its a lot like the real thing, especially at first.. getting a feel for your truck and the controls.. then watching that trailor, and even more important.. the 4 wheels all doing their own thing... Game wise:Pretty relaxing really, dont treat it like GTA and get a feel for the drive, and its ok.Steaming radio allows you to listen to real radio while you drive.Bonuses for things like actually parking your load, vs quick park.Ran smooth and well. AI was not horrid like I have seen in other driving sims.. sure, they do stupid things.. but I do / did to. Nothing that was flat out crazy AI trying to kill me.. not yet anyway.You can progress your CDL Endorsements as you get experience. ( As in, you get your cert to haul haz mat etc.. which offers more money, but risk )At this point I cant really complain, its not a play it everyday thing, but when your just wanting to drive, make some money, maybe get your own business going.. it was fun. I am going back to it for sure! A big change from all the time I spent driving in the mud.. hehe.. I like this.			"

												I suck at reversing the trailer (even though I'm getting better at it) but that's not the game's fault. There's really quite a lot to recommend in this game, so I'll get to it.Pros1. Very realistic driving simulation, from game pad and joystick support, to manual gear changes, faithful replicas of various brands of trucks, etc.2. Somehow they compress time -- a 4 hour journey can be completed in 30 minutes of real time game play. This was one of the biggest questions I had before buying this game since I didn't want to be stuck at the wheel for hours at a time. I don't know how they do it, but they compress driving time very well, so that you feel the longer deliveries but at the same time don't burn an afternoon travelling a simulated highway.3. Great graphics and physics engine -- rain, cloudy skies, wiper action, water drops on your windshield, headlights, all nicely represented. 4. Some RPG elements included -- running your own trucking business, buying vehicles, hiring drivers, all add a nice touch to what was supposed to be just a sim.5. The most amazing thing to me is: the landscape and the scenery look real! I don't know how they mapped thousands of miles of roads, signs, landmarks, scenery, etc. but they did a damn fine job of it. You really feel like you're in Europe!Cons1. Kind of steep learning curve, figuring out the driving controls/keys, had to keep pausing and checking the game setting options (there are a LOT of functions). I wish this part could be covered in a tutorial of some sort.2. A sandbox / practice mode would have been nice. You literally get thrown into the driver's seat from the start. But I guess some people like jumping in right away, but some like me prefer to have a decent understanding of all the controls first. Although I'm not as good a driver as I want to be, I'm actually having fun (minus the tickets and accident citations)!Recommended!7.5/10.0			"

The map is huge and realistic, there are many trucks to drive and the updates make the game even better. You can drive with a steering wheel (which I think is a lot better) or even with your mouse (and of course with the arrows).			"

												I bought this game in 2014 through Humble Bundle for a cheap price, since I've always been at least a little interested in trucks. I thought I wouldn't play it that much, but I got my first 250 hours in a matter of few months. I even started to buy  truck scale models after playing this game. :D Now I've kinda faded away from it, but I still would recommend it, especially with mods! The modding community is very large in this game, considering its a trucking game.10/10!EDIT 25/11/2016:I now have played this game for over 1000 hours, and still keep on playing it. I think it is more than worth its price, and if you like any kind of simulators, this game is for you! SCS is also updating this game with new stuff, which is rare for a game that is as old as this one is.RECOMMENDED!			"

												Have you ever wondered, why ETS2 is one of the most played games on Steam? You should have, as there is no way getting around this wonderful simulator, at least not if you want to be a real PCGamer... but what makes that sim-game so special?Euro Truck Simulator makes it easy for any new players to jump right in and is very suitable for beginners as the options allow for massive customization when it comes to how realistic the game shall be. Talking about beginners, you don't need to have the latest and greatest PC in order to enjoy the game, it even runs on a five year old Intel HD Graphics but trust me, if you're lucky enough to own a high-end graphics card/ a decent rig in general, you will be able to push the graphics to a level on which you might be able to forget that you are just playing a video game! Anyways, if you don't want to sleep, you don't have to, just remove the mark in front of the fatigue simulation and you are free to drive for how long you want! But if you're one of those players, who would give everything for realism, you will also be absolutely pleased by what ETS2 has to offer. Let it be the fuel consumption of your truck or the air brake system, the possibilities for realism fanatics are endless. At that point, I should also mention that the game has great support for various steering wheels and TrackIR to give you the best possible driving experience. It is also possible, to mod the heck out of your personal Euro Truck Simulator version, in order to make it your very own experience. For those of you that aren't very interested in modding, you can also purchase a wide array of DLC packages that will add new parts of Europe or some new tuning options. Some of the best DLC that I can recommend at this point are the Scandinavia DLC as an example for a map expansion and the Mighty Griffin DLC that makes the stock Scania trucks almost look as awesome as some of the modded ones do.But does that mean that the game is flawless? No, it's not. Considering the AI drivers' behavior or some of the old parts of the map, there are some minor problems here and there but they definitely don't brake the game or make it unplayable. Just enjoy the game and listen to some of your music in the background, you will not regret it!			"

One of the best games ever!I played Euro Truck Simulator for the first time when I bought it from my local store which sells cracked games for $2-3. I bought just 3 games, one of them was ETS2. I played it for a while, realised that it was one of those games which people actually don't realise the perfection of. This game is Excellent.I was so happy with this game that I immediately spent $50 of my savings to buy a Steam Wallet Card and purchased the Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Deluxe Bundle.I would surely recommend this game to Simulator Lovers and for any other gamers, who can for once, just for a change, leave Counter Strike or GTA V and play this game.And for the climax, I really spent all my savings on this game, and have no more money left to buy your upcoming game - American Truck Simulator. I have really high hopes on this game. Devs, can you please gift me a copy of this game, or at least give me a Gift Pass for Beta Access? Just a request. BTW, good luck for the release!			"

Don't let the premise dissuade you; this game is great.ETS2 gives you a competent driving experience with also a business management metagame. The whole thing is very enjoyable  as you expand your business, buy new trucks, and hire new drivers.Do yourself a favor and get the Going East Expansion. Get the bundle of this. Great game.			"

												So hey, this is my story of my experience on this game.I've played this games on/off for months and everytime I play it, I get a good laugh.Why? Because the physics are sooooooo OP!!Why are the physics so OP? Well, you think it's all good when you're going onto the M1 and you turn at exactly 35 miles per hour to be safe, little do you know that the next thing you see is you tipping over onto your side and making a huge bang.It's best to play this game while you are intoxicated off drinking milk and eating Kelloggs™ Rice Krispies.Oh, another thing to point out is the AI cars.Boy... do they give you a rustle to your jimmies. You are on the motorway or you could be on the dual carrageway then suddenly you see that you have a vehicle crash ticket. You wonder how? Well the AI love to casually crash into the behind of you and ♥♥♥♥ you up the♥♥♥♥♥ You have to pay the fine and then you just trot on.Thank you for reading my beautiful review of this wonderful game created and published by Electronic Arts.

Please select your background music carefully xD.   Go get some Eurobeats collection from Initial D, man!	以下为具体歌单(Here are my suggestions)：- Daja Vu- Gas Gas Gas- Heartbeat- Speedy speed boy- Space boy- DON'T STOP THE MUSIC- NO ONE SLEEP IN TOKYO在您开始播放上述音乐后，请开始尽情享受 漂移	和 高速驾驶	的乐趣When you starts playing the following music, you can start enjoying your  drifting	 and  drag racing	.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a truck driving simulator, it contains some European cities and roads. You can work for an employer or your own truck, recruit drivers and buy new trucks or upgrade your trucks using money earned by completing deliveries, which involve picking up a load then driving to it's destination and parking the trailer. There is also a multiplayer mod, so you can start a convoy with other drivers and develop your own trucking company. I would recommend the game to anyone who likes trucks or driving games, there are also DLCs which give you new cities, loads and truck customization.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator provides an amazing realistic enviroment which allows it's users to drive around and explore the world. Normally, to be honest from past experience of the SCS software I felt the graphics were not the best, but since they've released Euro Truck Simulator my opinion has changed. This has been because of the constant updates and the multiplayer and the amount of effort they made to improve the game. I love this to bits and nothing or no other truck simulator would be able to compete against this simulator. It's a must have and could never be replaced with another simulator.			"

WHY THIS IS A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION OF GAMESIf every game developer did what SCS has done then most people would be sticking to their older games for a lot longer.I am still AMAZED that not only are their still patches coming out for this game, but additional content and inprovements that are FREE...Yes you read that right...""FREE"". There is DLC content as well, some worth getting. I would also recomend getting exspansion packs too.My gameplay hours are not correct as I got this game hours after it was released, then more recently switched to steam.It is one of those games in a funny sort of way, is real addictive. MODS make this game awesome.Here Is Some Of My Reasons To Recomend The Game The Open World Map - is vast so there are always new places to go that you have not yet driven You Can Take Your Time - with a long distance load and park up and save your game, and do a little bit everyday or you can just drive hard. A Rare Thing - the developers have listened to the community and while they can't do everything, on the whole they have designed the game towards what the players want and in my opinion that is a huge plus when you consider Ubisoft who ignores everybody The Modding Community - the game was designed with the modders in mind, I use promods map and drive around in an old Mercedes or new Volvo. This makes the gaming experience come alive.To sum up...just buy it, you will get your moneys worth out of this game.			"

I have an old steering wheel and pedals that I hooked up to my computer and it made the game so much easier. The graphics in this game are outstanding, it's like I am acctually driving a truck. I have found absolutley no glitches, or bugs in the game, it all flows really smoothly. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone, even if you don't like simulator games or think they are boring.			"

												I am 21 years old, unemployed, and now I have trucker stories about how much I hate British roads and how they drive on the wrong side of the road and how their rotaries are awful and I failed to do three no damage runs because of them. I don't know how I feel about this.All jokes aside, this is a pretty decent simulator. You can actually get a feel for the weight and power of your truck even if you use keyboard controls, which the game recommends against but I use anyway because this game doesn't tell ME what to do! But really though, if you're a simulation enthusiast or you want something to unwind upon and just stare at pretty scenery or just drive around making deliveries or something then this is for you.

This game with all it's DLC can make it an even better driving experience, with Fantasy, Flip, Forces of Nature, and so many more paint job DLCs. Not enough room for you to drive around Europe? Well, you can get even more room and driving area in the 'Going East' DLC! Another great feature of this game, is now you can interact with other truckers on the Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer Mod! Enjoy long roads and amazingly created countryside, along with funny moments, failures, and everything else imaginable, with your friends! Full 10/10			"

												This is without a doubt the best simulator out there. The world is HUGE. And when I say HUGE, I mean HUUUUUGE. It takes HOURS to get from one side of the map to the other side.""Well, in that case, the graphics will be bad!"" is what you might think. To be honest, this is one of the most beatiful games I've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredibly high. The scenery is really well detailed and there will always be something to look at. The sun shining through the trees, the incredible reflections in the water, the beatiful cities, and so on and so forth.What I would really reccomend you to buy too is the Going East! DLC. It might be €9,99, but I've never been so surprised about a DLC pack. It expands the map a lot, with completely new cities, towns and even more beatiful scenery! After having played about 45 hours at the time of posting this, I've only explored around 40% of the map. There's so much more for me to see, even after playing for 45 hours!Another cool thing about this game is that you start out as a 1-person company. Later on, you will have the option to expand your company to unknown limits! You'll have multiple garages around Europe. In these garages, you will have countless trucks being driven by AI companions you can hire. That means this game isn't only about driving your truck, but also about expanding your empire! This gives the game an even deeper layer which means even more fun!The driving mechanics also surprised me. I've never seen driving mechanics like this before and they are really, really pleasant! The mechanics make really small movements in the steering wheel possible, even while using a keyboard. I myself stopped using a keyboard because I had a steering wheel laying around. The steering wheel made my experience even more pleasant.Also, the AI cars and trucks in the game are terrific. They really take not in what you are doing. It feels like they are predicting what you are going to do. Sometimes they do screw up by not letting you go first when you have the right to, but this is no big issue to me. This rarely happens.Another great aspect is the modding community. There are countless amounts of mods, of which my favorite one is the Multiplayer Mod. Yes, that's right. There is a multiplayer mod for this game. Another massive pro! Other mods include map expentions. There is a Scandinavian Map, which is also huge. This mod is available for download for free. This means there will be even more to explore! An extra plus, modding is as easy as trowing some files into the Mod folder.In my experience, this is BY FAR the best simulation game I have ever played.

												You know a driving simulator is good when it makes you stop at a red light and have you following the speed limit so that you don't damage the cargo. I have been playing this game for a long time, on and 'off' steam and i cannot get enough of it. It also helps that this game has great community that is constantly developing new trucks, routes, cargo packs etc. which make sure that you don't get bored with it very easily. if you are into simulators this is a must have and is worth every penny of its asking price (i bought it on sale BTW). Like all other games it has its weak points like you not being able to see the trucks and drivers you hire like you could in 18WoS and absolutely no interaction with other trucks on the road. But all in all an excellent game that i will play for many many more hours.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is amazing.  GOTY.  You drive a truck from one city to another, obeying the rules of the road, driving carefully as you can stand, and getting to your destination on time.  For this, you get money and XP.  XP you spend on unlocking the ability to transport different stuff, basically more lucrative jobs.  You save up the money to buy your own truck (and pay speeding fines and suchlike.)  It's like Elite.  Yes.  It's like Elite, but with trucks.  A single delivery can take 30-40 minutes, easily.  The game accurately models the feeling of driving a large, unfamiliar vehicle.  If you've ever hired a van you will know the feeling - at first everything seems wrong and you're all over the place, then you start to get the hang of it, but just as you're getting cocky, it starts to rain.  OH GOD HOW DO YOU TURN THE WIPERS ON?  During a job, things will go wrong, with hilarious consequences.  There's something about the fact that you spend the time trying to drive sensibly that makes it much funnier when you, through a series of panic-strewn mistakes, end up stuck between a tree and a sign, twenty feet from the road.  I found the trip from Cardiff to Sheffield to be particularly tricky.  There seem to be a few fast bits of road followed by tricky bends.  I nearly shed my load at one point.  It was that exciting.

												Well, how do I put this...Let's go straight to the point.I DEFINITELY recommend this game.I've played some trucking simulator before I even had Steam... And yes, this game is marvelous.Why, you ask?- The trucks' model are well detailed (and fully licensed!)- Relaxing gameplay (even with keyboard)- Real-time radio streams across all Europe- You can even add your own songs, and change the track easily- Amazing scenery in an enormous open world- Beautiful looks- Easy to mod- Truck customization systemCons :Although this is not really annoying, but- The city layout is overall the same everywhere. It's fine though, considering the whole world itself is a minimized version of Europe- Speeding ticket (I know, it's not the game's fault lol)Sums up, if you want a fast-paced, thrilling game where you're racing with a truck, this game is not for you.But, if you want a relaxing, soothing game where you drive a damn truck, delivering cargo somewhere and enjoying the scenery with no hurry...JUST. BUY. IT. It's worth every penny.Verdict :9.5/10 would buyAnd one more positive thing.Scania.Addition : The DLCs are pretty good too, especially the Essentials bundle!			"

												Yes, this is the best truck game other than the other truck games. I used to play this on Demo version before playing the full version of this game.You can relax in your chair and press keyboards to move the truck around. But don't crash it with your own truck because this will pay your own money! For someone elses truck, you can repair it without you paying for it. You can also extend the map by buying the Scandinavia and Going East pack or you can have mods over it. And you can buy paint jobs and the High Power Cargo Pack also! I got Metallic Paint Jobs for free by creating an account on World Of Trucks.[worldoftrucks.com] And again I got another paint job which is the Viking Legends Paint Jobs Pack because I bourght the Scandinavian map between May 7th 2015 - May 14th 2015. My favourite truck of all is the Iveco Strallis Hi-Way. Anyway, this simulator has very good AI (I press the Horn button when I see a Iveco truck!).There are some glitches that I found like going on roads out of bounds, cars crashing to each other while the road works block the other side and trains goes through you. Sometimes in multiplayer (fan made) or maybe a glitch, your truck can fly in the air and will 'very damage' your truck likely 100%.The DLC is really good pricing than like Train Simulator, it is affordable. If you really want to save money, you can get Metallic Paint Jobs for free, and others, wait for a discount!I really like this game, if you like trucks, buy this one! SCS, you deserve my money.			"

												Going to be as honest as I can here.I've always wanted to drive a truck. I'd love to drive a truck. I don't even own a driver's license. So I can't drive a truck. Or a car. I'm not allowed to. Unless, of course, it's a pixeled truck.Guess what, ETS2 has pixeled trucks! Lucky me!Despite not having played ETS2, considering my gametime, I realised this game deserves a (extremely) positive review.It's just not possible to not like driving a truck around ETS2's roads, honking at lazy drivers, getting some speeding fines and even the occasional bump. From driving over the edge, while trying to deliver your cargo in time, to having to park the truck to get that extra XP, ETS2 has it all. You can even set your own playlist for the radio, with your own songs! Hell, I can't listen to some musics now without linking them to the game straight away.The truck design is incredibly good, and it's actually a thrill to drive (and mess around) in 1st person mode. Every truck is a different truck. From the noise they make to their acceleration, and it's easy to tell.It's a relaxing game, which I'll end up spending hours on. You'll even say: ""Hell, just one more delivery."", and when you noticed, you've done 10 more, and ""wasted"" a day.I recommend this game to anyone that just wants to have a good time.PS. I don't recommend going max speed on a curve. Really.			"

												Back in the day that I first played 18 Wheels of Steel, I wouldn't imagine if that company will be improving on some stuff. Now there's a game that you drive European trucks and drive all around Europe in HD. The modding community this game is insane enough like you can drive a American truck and I mean yes, this game does have very good modding capabilties. There's not much to explore more South in Italy and the Eastern part of Europe but that can be fixed by mods. Not only that, the people who created this game released more areas by DLCs like west of Europe and up North where you both meet Scania and Volvo factories. Now I was wondering where is the other factories for the rest?			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 - it may sound like it's gonna be one of those stupid and unnecessary games to play, but it isn't. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the most fun, and probably realistic (by realistic, I mean, it includes Lights, traffic lights, indicators, windshield wipers, retarders for slowing down, and more!) games that I have played to date! The game can be easily modded, and the moving community is still in full swing, about 2 years after it's first release. There are several types of trucks, including Volvo, Scania, MAN, IVECO and DAF, and the map is across Europe, from Britain to Italy, or Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic if you have the Going East! DLC. Also, the DLC always comes along, with paint packs, and cargo packs, but at this point in time, we haven't really seen many packs other than custom paint packs, which I hope will die down, making way for proper DLC. There are many settings for the likes of Cruise Control, Retarders, high and low beam lights, which can also be mapped on a DSD Button Box, for example. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing this simulator, and I hope there will be more happy gaming hours to come! Here are my pros and cons of this game currently.PROS:-A fun, and realistic simulator-At the moment (26th December '14) it's incredibly cheap for what it is-Modding community is very strong -Full wheel support, along with a shifter, and a button box, also.CONS:-At the start, you keep having to do ""Quick Jobs"", but I believe that they are just a bit boring, as you cannot customise the truck you are driving, because it isn't yours, so I Cheat Engine'd the game :-P-Can be quite frustrating with the AI, sometimes, you try to let them turn into another road, but they don't move, because they think it's your right of way. Yeah, I know, quite annoying.-No integrated Multiplayer mode, you need a mod to play online. So that's about it, overall a great game! You can download some awesome mods, or just download the Multiplayer Mod and drive with friends! Get it for £3.74 (or however much it is) quickly, it's so worth it!			"

Well there is one thing... all the ""Paint DLC"" is a total scam and should all be free, it's all stuff you can get for free if you MOD the game, so if modders are willing to put it up for free then SCS should too or at least put Comunity content into there awsome game so it can be added easier.Still the game gets a A++ from me.

												This is more of a game than a simulator, but the actual driving of the truck is a good simulation.  The gameplay components, IMO, make this better than a truck driving simulator.  I really enjoy managing a company, hiring drivers, owning trucks, expanding business, etc...  It's always fun to jam out to the radio while moving freight down the highway too.  I like that the distances are somewhat fictional and the cities are not fully modeled, I enjoy that when you come into a city, you only have to sit in some traffic and only sit at a few lights.  Basically the industrial areas of cities are recreated for use.  It would be nice to see the occasional iconic landmark that we all would recognize though. It would get old fast if the whole city were realistically modeled.  All in all it's much better than you could or would expect from a truck driving sim.			"

												This is quite an enjoyable game. Driving through detailed environment is beautiful. As you progress through the game, you kinda learn how it is to build a truck company up, and its a really deep experience. I find it really relaxing to play this game, just living on the road. This game is kinda perfect, because the real deal, like if you would work as a truck driver in real life, it would had probably sucked, because of the distance and the part where your away from your family, but since its only a game you don't need to worry about this :)			"

												In a world where we easily get bored by explosions, racing, gunfights, space, magic, dragons and pirates, you sometimes need a friendly reminder of what life is really all about. In Euro Truck Simulator 2, you are not a hero. You do not posess superpowers and neither will you make much of an impact on the world around you. All you are is a guy (or gal if you're into that). Norman Nomal, John Doe, Mister Smith. You have a full-time job and plenty of bills to pay, yet you long for a little bit of luxury. But, this is real life and there are no quests, no bosses to slay for loot, no hidden treasure to unearth - there is only good and honest work.You are a truck driver, nothing more. Plus, you're only at the start of your carreer, no money, no truck. To change this, you can either sign up as a driver for other companies and earn a little cash, or skip that bother alltogether and take a loan to kickstart your own small enterprise. With your very own, somewhat customisable truck (visually and performance-wise) you can start raking in some real cash by transporting various goods all across Central Europe. From the meadows of Paris to Warsaw, from Edinburgh to Vienna, you can drive whereever your assignments will take you, all without loading-screens. The roads and landscapes are inspired by reality, though significantly scaled down and simplified. A drive from the most northern part of the map all the way down south would take you anywhere between 40 minutes and an hour.In addition to making all the hauls yourself, you can hire more drivers to work for you, if you can supply them with vehicles. They will then automatically do their routes and get you a nice, daily income. Spend the money you make on upgrades for your truck, your garage or on more drivers. There is even a rudimentary skill-system that will allow you to unlock additional missions, like long-range hauls or high-value freight. The graphics are actually quite pretty, especially when considering what you usually get with one of these simulator-types. Complexity is where ETS2 suffers, the missions are always the same (transport cargo X from A to B), other than upgrading your truck there really isn't anything to spend your money on and the whole freight-business aspect is very shallow. The latter is especially unfortunate, seeing that going the step from lone-wolf diver to business magnate might have been a pretty cool experience, upgrading your entire fleet, setting up convoys and signing contracts for long-term partnerships. None of that is possible and at the end of the day, it will always be you doing all the work - drive, sleep, fill up gas, rinse and repeat. Expanding on the business-sim elements might have let ETS2 truly stand out.All that aside, though, you might find ETS2 strangely mesmerising and highly addictive, quite similarly to what Papers, Please did to me - a queer feeling that made me actually enjoy playing a game simulating work.

												I don't know what it is about this game that has me playing it. I really can't figure it out. This is my brie experience with the game. Basically, all I do in game is take jobs, pick up what needs dilivering, drive to the city it needs to be delivered to, and repeat. To be fair it's not QUITE that simple. I do have to worry about gas, getting enough sleep, traffic tickets, accidents, and remembering to drive on the left side of the road when im in England.I figured out I could get a loan from a bank that allows me to purchase my own truck which gets me better paying jobs. And more jobs I do well, the more experience get allowing me level up and get skill points to make my driver more efficient and able to drive longe routes. All this does not explain why I keep playing this game though. It's not exactly and exciting game. I haven't come across anything that has made me go ""Wow!"" I'm just pretending to be a truck driver in Europe driving, as an Amerian, strange looking trucks on strangely built roads and highways with exits that always seem to apear where they shouldnt be.Maybe it's that ever since I was small I used to wonder what it would be like to be a trucker. I remember raising my fist in an up an down motion as my parents passed them hoping they'd understand and pull the horn. They usually were nice enough to. now as an adult I travel a lot and have always wondered what it would be like to drive from Miami to Nashville in a big rig. This game sort of allows me that.I don't expect this game to be most peoples thing, but for the few of us that wonder this thing is easily worth the money. Just remember when you have to drive on the left! "

												I personally can't really explain why but I do recommend this game. I play it every now and then when I just want to relax. There's something relaxing about just driving that truck to a destination, listening to your music, and getting overhauled by literally everyone because you don't want to get a ticket. It feels like meditating when I don't even meditate, I just sit there and drive. Driving your car has the same effect I guess but you'd be looking for a destination to go too and it costs petrol.  It's not a special game, it's just a relaxing game. The gameplay is fine, the graphics are fine, you even have sounds for your horn. Also you can buy Volvo's because everyone wants to get in on some Volvo action.			"

												Simulator games have been quite niche traditionally, but Euro Truck Simulator 2 changes that. Sure it has the realism of Sim titles but there are actually more complexities than that, such as having a squad of drivers which participate in missions of their own. You'll also expand your empire and level up, granting you access to more risky and lengthy routes. There's something theraputic about driving along while listening to a podcast. Well worth a shot if you like the sound of the concept			"

I have an old steering wheel and pedals that I hooked up to my computer and it made the game so much easier. The graphics in this game are outstanding, it's like I am acctually driving a truck. I have found absolutley no glitches, or bugs in the game, it all flows really smoothly.

Really good graphics, great feel (especially with a G27 racing wheel), and you can also listen to your own music while driving, or a radio station from the internet. When you have a bad day, this is a game to go to. Very relaxing.... that is.. if you know how to drive of course, then I guess it wouldn't be so relaxing. Overall 9/10 for me. If you love to drive, this is a must have, and this comes from a person who could care less about Mack Trucks.			"

												Serenely relaxing and ridiculously enthralling - as unlikely as it seems, you have to try it to believe it. An incredibly surprising success.Euro Truck Simulator 2 (aka ETS2) is THE premier truck driving simulator game available on Steam. Very few games (actually, are there even any?) rival its amazing depth. Its Czech developer SCS Games is well-known for their truck simulator games, and securing the licenses of all the trucks you see in the game is no easy feat.You play as a trucker, delivering various loads of cargo from city to city. Journeys can be very long or very short, depending on where you start from and where you end. In addition to the whole driving aspect, you're also in charge of running a truck delivery company (it starts out with the grand employee total of 1 - yourself, but then expands as you hire more workers and buy more trucks).For the most part, the simulations in this game are very accurate. Trucks feel like a joy to drive (acceleration when the truck is transporting a heavy load is terrible, as it should be). Your employees also take jobs lasting several hours and you are credited the money (in-game) when you are done. If you have the money (real-life) to spare, for increased realism you can use a physical steering wheel controller and TrackIR so you can realistically drive the truck and look around.Although there is an amazing degree of realism in the truck models and world textures, there does not seem to be as much (I stress ""as much"" here because there is a certain amount...just not as much) care put into the menus. Compared to the rest of the game they feel comparatively close to a mere afterthought. Consider, however, that this is but a merely minor nitpick of mine, as you won't actually be spending most of the game looking at the menus, but rather driving.A slightly more frustrating flaw detailed here is one that is very likely to spike blood pressures. As much as I want to be nice about it, because this is a game I really like, I'm going to go all out here and say: ♥♥♥♥ the AI drivers with a force of a thousand suns. They are among the most suicidal and idiotic computer AI I've had the misfortune of playing with. They refuse to give you the right of way, they refuse to stop while you're turning out (and cause some much unneeded fines/damage), they are literally douches in general. Come to think about it, isn't that a sadly accurate simulation of most drivers nowadays?The good news is, you can disable the AI by playing on a multiplayer server. You have to download this ETS2 Multiplayer[ets2mp.com] client. Do note that you may need to downgrade your game version in order to run this - thankfully, older ETS2 game versions are preserved as ""betas"" in Steam for that purpose. The only downside is that you aren't allowed to auto-park your truck on these servers, and I can tell you this first-hand, parking is HARD.Time to end off with a few funny anecdotes: This is actually quite a fun game to stream gameplay of, both for the streamer and for the viewer. Especially when the streamer reads chat while driving, gets distracted and goes pinball trucking off the road rails and/or trees! Another fun thing to do, if the streamer hasn't changed default controls, is to ask him to use camera mode 8. If you have this game, you'll know what it does. Then see how long he goes without crashing. HAHA!When to buyGame has been bundled a few times. The most recent bundle, as far as I know, did not contain any DLC. Try to wait for the Collector's Bundle to hit a sale.As far as DLC recommendations go, I'd recommend as bare minimum the High Power Cargo Pack and the Going East expansions. The Scandinavia expansion seems great too (note that I don't actually have it at this point though).8.5/10I originally intended to write this review as a thank you to my friend Oddllama, who graciously gifted me this game and a ton of DLC, for his website revamp...but then he shut his website down. Boooooooooooooooo! :( "

												Euro Truck simulator 2 is a 'special' game because of it tendencies to make the player drift off into a world where you only have to focus on one thing: Driving. The game is unique as it delivers an experience that no other game ive played offers such as: Graphics that are simply breathtaking when on the specific high setting, the amount of attention to detain put into this game and it's world shows enomous dedication and a good eye, although the cities arent the actual size that probably should be, the major cities are quite realistic and have that original feel to them.The mechanics of the game are quite fair as if you speed you get a ticket, break rules: ticket and ect. The game is fairly good with its mechanics physics wise, I have yet to see a time where my truck has slingshoted out into the air. You can do everything that a truck can mostly do such as honk the horn, indicate, fill up with fuel (essential), cruise control, lights, manual gearboxes... the works essentially.The most unique thing about this game is that since it is just about driving, it has the sense of meditation or zen to it, usually I feel after playing an hour of the game refreshed or it clears your mind, it's also great before sleep as with other games where you find you are always looking around for dangers or involving yourself too much in typing or whatever, in this game it's simple, stressfree and overall very enjoyable. This game is great for all ages and especially those who are truck enthusiasts, people who dont mind sitting down for an hour or two and just relax will love the game and everything in it. The combination of just driving through the beautiful landscape is fully worth the money to look at and there is a wide selection of trucks to choose as well.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to all who look at the game and this review, and to all that buy the game:HAPPY DRIVING!(For those out of 10 enthusiasts)10/10			"

												This is without a doubt the best simulator out there. The world is HUGE. And when I say HUGE, I mean HUUUUUGE. It takes HOURS to get from one side of the map to the other side.""Well, in that case, the graphics will be bad!"" is what you might think. To be honest, this is one of the most beatiful games I've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredibly high. The scenery is really well detailed and there will always be something to look at. The sun shining through the trees, the incredible reflections in the water, the beatiful cities, and so on and so forth.What I would really reccomend you to buy too is the Going East! DLC. It might be €9,99, but I've never been so surprised about a DLC pack. It expands the map a lot, with completely new cities, towns and even more beatiful scenery! After having played about 45 hours at the time of posting this, I've only explored around 40% of the map. There's so much more for me to see, even after playing for 45 hours!Another cool thing about this game is that you start out as a 1-person company. Later on, you will have the option to expand your company to unknown limits! You'll have multiple garages around Europe. In these garages, you will have countless trucks being driven by AI companions you can hire. That means this game isn't only about driving your truck, but also about expanding your empire! This gives the game an even deeper layer which means even more fun!The driving mechanics also surprised me. I've never seen driving mechanics like this before and they are really, really pleasant! The mechanics make really small movements in the steering wheel possible, even while using a keyboard. I myself stopped using a keyboard because I had a steering wheel laying around. The steering wheel made my experience even more pleasant.Also, the AI cars and trucks in the game are terrific. They really take not in what you are doing. It feels like they are predicting what you are going to do. Sometimes they do screw up by not letting you go first when you have the right to, but this is no big issue to me. This rarely happens.Another great aspect is the modding community. There are countless amounts of mods, of which my favorite one is the Multiplayer Mod. Yes, that's right. There is a multiplayer mod for this game. Another massive pro! Other mods include map expentions. There is a Scandinavian Map, which is also huge. This mod is available for download for free. This means there will be even more to explore! An extra plus, modding is as easy as trowing some files into the Mod folder.In my experience, this is BY FAR the best simulation game I have ever played. You should definetly try it.The score I am giving: 10/10I guess you could say this score is for clear reasons!			"

												It's a game where you drive a truck from one warehouse to another. Turn the radio up and enjoy the scenery. If backing up a trailer stresses you out, you can just skip it. Use a wheel controller if you have one, so you don't even have to think hard about steering. The European countryside is varied and pretty.			"

												Best sim game loads of mods and very gripping game mod have a lot of support there is official forums and even multiplayer mod. The game itself is great has a lot of 3rd party support like xbox controllers, g27 steering wheel bug even with keyboard and mouse it's very playable there is a lot of modifications you can make to your truck in game like new chassis , engines , bull bars, lights and wheels. The sim part of game hasn't skimped either there is mods and options to add further realism but from standard game you get realistic fuel consumption , weight distribution , fatigue sim , damage limits, breakdowns, speed cameras , weather and even roadworks.I've put many hours into the game and it's worth every penny and it has a lot of updates and extras and as I said before a huge modding community check some of my screenshots to see limits of trucks mods with aftermarket parts from third party modders			"

												What's so fun about pretending to drive a truck around Europe? I honestly don't know. I can't figure out why this game is so entertaining, but it is. Maybe it's the empire building aspect, combined with exploration, and trucks. Regardless, even though I am not able to pin-point why this game is hours of entertainment, it is a lot of fun. I was surprised when I kept loading it up to play more.That said, there are a few quirks to the game that bug me, but they are all minor enough as to not really take away from the overall enjoyment factor. AI traffic is mind bogglingly stupid, but that's just realism. The interaction between the clip planes and the working components of the truck don't always want to work together. That is to say, the trucks are rigid, and don't allow for the tires to drop to meet the contours of the ground, which gives you a high centered effect, but it's rare. I don't have a whole lot more to add, but if you're into sims, give it a try.			"

I am still working on the building back up part but Im close enough. The ingame radio will hide the sounds of your crying when you fail at backing up. Which you will. Alot. The fields of flowers will absord your tears. Also from backing up. Are you ready to drive an actual 18 wheeler in actual Germany? Buy.This.Game.			"

												First off, I highly recommend this game. Provided you also get he following DLC, High Power Cargo Pack and Going East Expansion. The first adds new cargo and trailers that are both more rewarding and heavier than the original cargo variety. The second adds a large new section of map to drive, and many more cities and countries. Both are well worth the added cost. The other DLC's available consists of custom paint jobs. They add nothing to the gameplay, but you can buy those if you like them.About the game;You are a truck driver in Europe. You select what city you want to base your future company in, and start out working for companies delivering cargo with their trucks. You gain experience with each load that is safely delivered without doing too much damage. You can choose to buy your own truck as soon as you save enough money, or by getting a loan from the bank. If you own your own truck, you can upgrade or customize it however you choose (once you obtain the experience levels to unlock the upgrades wanted). You earn more money if you own your truck vs. driving a company's truck. As you get more money and discover various cities, you can buy additional garages and hire drivers to work for you... increasing your income. You will have to buy a truck for each new driver, and upgrade your garages to gain space for more drivers.  Garages come in 2 sizes. Small has space for 3 drivers and costs $180,000  A small garage can be upgraded to a large garage for an additional $100,000. A large garage also has a fuel pump for your benefit.While the game is a good game, it is not without certain shortcomings.First, There are many features that SCS had the code for from prior releases in the series that could have been included but were not. In Hard Trucks wipers had 2 speeds, now they only have 1. In Extreme Trucking, you had a variety of weather and road conditions, from ice and snow, to dirt roads and steep terrain. Here, the weather is very simple... it is either not raining, or its raining. Roads are all paved and quite uneventful. Hills are gradual, and the roads are formed from a set pattern of road sections that have been copied and repeated over and over. Another omission is that much of the available upgrades do absolutely nothing.  Most trucks offer 3 different truck cabs. A standard cab w/ no sleeper, a standard cab w/ sleeper, and a larger cab with a bigger sleeper. None of the cabs affect the trucks fuel economy, handling, or performance. The addition of a sleeper does not enable you to rest anywhere that a non-sleeper truck can. It's all purely cosmetic. Same for the transmissions. Al trucks come with a 12 speed transmission regardless of engine. Upgrading to the other 12 speed transmission does nothing for the performance or fuel economy. Tires are another thing, no matter what tires you choose, the handling, performance, fuel economy and wear are the same. All pure cosmetics. Adding a front bumper or guard does nothing to increase the durability of the truck. the AI traffic pays no attention to the existance of the roof mounted safety strobe lamps, nor is there and aerodynamic penalty for the wind drag from a roof mounted light bar full of lights and horns. Horns are ignored by traffic as well. Both horns and roof safety strobe lamps are purely there for cosmetics.The AI traffic has it's own issues. They will change lanes suddenly, stop suddenly, crash into you, and cause traffic jams lasting over an hour. They also are prone to hauling♥♥♥♥♥.. I've been running 102 mph and been passed and couldn't keep up with traffic cars before in 50 mph zones.A big issue relates to the drivers you hire and the trucks they drive. It does not make one bit of difference if you buy the cheapest truck you can get (a $97,000 Man for example), or buy the most tricked out, most powerful, most expensive truck (A fully decked out Scania or Volvo costing $275,000+)... you earn the same. Upgrading their trucks does not speed them up, enable them to haul heavier loads, or make them happy... It doesn't do anything. Save your money and give each driver hte cheapest basic truck you can buy. You also cannot see the other trucks on the road, nor in the garages, ever. They only exist as a small thumbnail picture in the manager section.Things I'd like to see in future updates:More weather types... Snow and Ice, hail, fog, etc...More variety in roads, Steep hills and switchbacks, narrow roads with high dropoffs and no guardrails. Dirt, gravel and pothole filled bumpy roads. Roads with deep ruts.Functional tires that have varying grip depending on terrain and weather. Make better tires last longer or have better traction than cheap tires.Adjust the engine outputs and trailer load weights so that pulling a 55,000lb trailer with the entry level engine is nearly impossible... making having a more powerful engine something you both need and desire. Adjust fuel economy so that the more powerful the engine, the worse your mileage (currently, there is no difference)Make upgrading trucks for your driver have a benefit.Make traffic AI react to safety hazard strobes (stay back a safe distance, give way when turning, etc...) as well as move over when possible if you blow the horn at them.Make truck cab differences matter. If no sleeper, you stay only in a Hotel or at your upgraded garage. If a small sleeper, you can rest at gas stations and rest areas, but you have to rest longer to get a full 11 hrs driving time. If you have the large sleeper, you rest better, so you don't have to rest as long to get fully rested.Add additional transmissions to different trucks. Some trucks have 10 speeds, some have 18 speeds.. "

												I know absolutely nothing about trucks, cars, etc... but I never thought that this game would be so much fun. The realism in this game is ridiculous. Really good graphics, great feel (especially with a G27 racing wheel), and you can also listen to your own music while driving, or a radio station from the internet. When you have a bad day, this is a game to go to. Very relaxing.... that is.. if you know how to drive of course, then I guess it wouldn't be so relaxing. Overall 9/10 for me. If you love to drive, this is a must have, and this comes from a person who could care less about Mack Trucks.			"

												Serenely relaxing and ridiculously enthralling - as unlikely as it seems, you have to try it to believe it. An incredibly surprising success.Euro Truck Simulator 2 (aka ETS2) is THE premier truck driving simulator game available on Steam. Very few games (actually, are there even any?) rival its amazing depth. Its Czech developer SCS Games is well-known for their truck simulator games, and securing the licenses of all the trucks you see in the game is no easy feat.You play as a trucker, delivering various loads of cargo from city to city. Journeys can be very long or very short, depending on where you start from and where you end. In addition to the whole driving aspect, you're also in charge of running a truck delivery company (it starts out with the grand employee total of 1 - yourself, but then expands as you hire more workers and buy more trucks).For the most part, the simulations in this game are very accurate. Trucks feel like a joy to drive (acceleration when the truck is transporting a heavy load is terrible, as it should be). Your employees also take jobs lasting several hours and you are credited the money (in-game) when you are done. If you have the money (real-life) to spare, for increased realism you can use a physical steering wheel controller and TrackIR so you can realistically drive the truck and look around.Although there is an amazing degree of realism in the truck models and world textures, there does not seem to be as much (I stress ""as much"" here because there is a certain amount...just not as much) care put into the menus. Compared to the rest of the game they feel comparatively close to a mere afterthought. Consider, however, that this is but a merely minor nitpick of mine, as you won't actually be spending most of the game looking at the menus, but rather driving.A slightly more frustrating flaw detailed here is one that is very likely to spike blood pressures. As much as I want to be nice about it, because this is a game I really like, I'm going to go all out here and say: ♥♥♥♥ the AI drivers with a force of a thousand suns. They are among the most suicidal and idiotic computer AI I've had the misfortune of playing with. They refuse to give you the right of way, they refuse to stop while you're turning out (and cause some much unneeded fines/damage), they are literally douches in general. Come to think about it, isn't that a sadly accurate simulation of most drivers nowadays?The good news is, you can disable the AI by playing on a multiplayer server. You have to download this ETS2 Multiplayer[ets2mp.com] client. Do note that you may need to downgrade your game version in order to run this - thankfully, older ETS2 game versions are preserved as ""betas"" in Steam for that purpose. The only downside is that you aren't allowed to auto-park your truck on these servers, and I can tell you this first-hand, parking is HARD.Time to end off with a few funny anecdotes: This is actually quite a fun game to stream gameplay of, both for the streamer and for the viewer. Especially when the streamer reads chat while driving, gets distracted and goes pinball trucking off the road rails and/or trees! Another fun thing to do, if the streamer hasn't changed default controls, is to ask him to use camera mode 8. If you have this game, you'll know what it does. Then see how long he goes without crashing. HAHA!When to buyGame has been bundled a few times. The most recent bundle, as far as I know, did not contain any DLC. Try to wait for the Collector's Bundle to hit a sale.As far as DLC recommendations go, I'd recommend as bare minimum the High Power Cargo Pack and the Going East expansions. The Scandinavia expansion seems great too (note that I don't actually have it at this point though).8.5/10I originally intended to write this review as a thank you to my friend Oddllama, who graciously gifted me this game and a ton of DLC, for his website revamp...but then he shut his website down. Boooooooooooooooo! :( "

												Euro Truck simulator 2 is a 'special' game because of it tendencies to make the player drift off into a world where you only have to focus on one thing: Driving. The game is unique as it delivers an experience that no other game ive played offers such as: Graphics that are simply breathtaking when on the specific high setting, the amount of attention to detain put into this game and it's world shows enomous dedication and a good eye, although the cities arent the actual size that probably should be, the major cities are quite realistic and have that original feel to them.The mechanics of the game are quite fair as if you speed you get a ticket, break rules: ticket and ect. The game is fairly good with its mechanics physics wise, I have yet to see a time where my truck has slingshoted out into the air. You can do everything that a truck can mostly do such as honk the horn, indicate, fill up with fuel (essential), cruise control, lights, manual gearboxes... the works essentially.The most unique thing about this game is that since it is just about driving, it has the sense of meditation or zen to it, usually I feel after playing an hour of the game refreshed or it clears your mind, it's also great before sleep as with other games where you find you are always looking around for dangers or involving yourself too much in typing or whatever, in this game it's simple, stressfree and overall very enjoyable. This game is great for all ages and especially those who are truck enthusiasts, people who dont mind sitting down for an hour or two and just relax will love the game and everything in it. The combination of just driving through the beautiful landscape is fully worth the money to look at and there is a wide selection of trucks to choose as well.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to all who look at the game and this review, and to all that buy the game:HAPPY DRIVING!(For those out of 10 enthusiasts)10/10			"

												Very good, cathartic experience.  I attempted to play this game as it was intended, but I soon discovered that being a complete and total sociopath was much more fun and rewarding.  Like my namesake Sanic, I made it my mission to make every delivery as fast as humanly possible, regardless of mechanical, monetary, or medical consequence.  On a 2 lane highway I'll drive down the center line, leaving a long line of cars behind me, unable to overtake.  On 3 lanes or more, I'll sit in the center lane, watch my mirrors, and if anyone tries to overtake me, I'll move into their lane to cut them off.  If I get lucky I cut them off in the process of overtaking me, charging me 400 Euros for a traffic violation, and sending the zippy little sedan into the median in order to wait for ADAC.  I find its helpful to yell obscenities at the foreigners.  On the way to Dresden from Berlin, I drove a minivan off the road.  As I passed them I leaned my head out the window and shouted ""That was for Pearl Harbor!""  I've collected enough speeding violations and vehicular damage (both to my own vehicle and to those around me) that I'm now several thousand Euros in debt.  I don't exactly know how their monopoly money converts to actual currency like USD, but its more debt than I'm willing to pay off.  I've now made it my mission to become a bigger drain on the European economy than Greece.  The internet radio stations were a nice touch.  It really topped of the atmosphere of the game, and taught me how to pronounce the funny made-up words they put in the game like Poznań and Szczecin.  10/10			"

												One of the many addicting sims that exist on Steam. Nothing like driving a truck to get your mind off of the real world. You got tons of content to keep you entertained for hours. Content such as mods, the fact you can slowly expand your business and have your company all over Europe, and the customization is just crazy. Well worth the buy and I think anyone who loves trucking sims needs to buy this game.			"

Oh boy. I have never been so wrong...This is more then a trucking game. It's like Therapy. This game is so relaxing, it's just amazing. If you got bored of it, go get some mods, new mods always bring a fresh new experience to the game. Got a long distance job? Turn on some music, and enjoy the road. This game goes on sale often, for 50% off and more. I highly recomend getting this game for people who love driving games.  "

												This game is acctually really good. When I bought the Humble Bundle this was one of the games that came with it, and I decided to try it. Getting into the game I really like the music playing in the loading screens and the game itself. I have an old steering wheel and pedals that I hooked up to my computer and it made the game so much easier. The graphics in this game are outstanding, it's like I am acctually driving a truck. I have found absolutley no glitches, or bugs in the game, it all flows really smoothly. I definitely reccomend this game to everyone, even if you don't like simulator games or think they are boring.			"

												I know absolutely nothing about trucks, cars, etc... but I never thought that this game would be so much fun. The realism in this game is ridiculous. Really good graphics, great feel (especially with a G27 racing wheel), and you can also listen to your own music while driving, or a radio station from the internet. When you have a bad day, this is a game to go to. Very relaxing.... that is.. if you know how to drive of course, then I guess it wouldn't be so relaxing. Overall 9/10 for me. If you love to drive, this is a must have, and this comes from a person who could care less about Mack Trucks.			"

												Serenely relaxing and ridiculously enthralling - as unlikely as it seems, you have to try it to believe it. An incredibly surprising success.Euro Truck Simulator 2 (aka ETS2) is THE premier truck driving simulator game available on Steam. Very few games (actually, are there even any?) rival its amazing depth. Its Czech developer SCS Games is well-known for their truck simulator games, and securing the licenses of all the trucks you see in the game is no easy feat.You play as a trucker, delivering various loads of cargo from city to city. Journeys can be very long or very short, depending on where you start from and where you end. In addition to the whole driving aspect, you're also in charge of running a truck delivery company (it starts out with the grand employee total of 1 - yourself, but then expands as you hire more workers and buy more trucks).For the most part, the simulations in this game are very accurate. Trucks feel like a joy to drive (acceleration when the truck is transporting a heavy load is terrible, as it should be). Your employees also take jobs lasting several hours and you are credited the money (in-game) when you are done. If you have the money (real-life) to spare, for increased realism you can use a physical steering wheel controller and TrackIR so you can realistically drive the truck and look around.Although there is an amazing degree of realism in the truck models and world textures, there does not seem to be as much (I stress ""as much"" here because there is a certain amount...just not as much) care put into the menus. Compared to the rest of the game they feel comparatively close to a mere afterthought. Consider, however, that this is but a merely minor nitpick of mine, as you won't actually be spending most of the game looking at the menus, but rather driving.A slightly more frustrating flaw detailed here is one that is very likely to spike blood pressures. As much as I want to be nice about it, because this is a game I really like, I'm going to go all out here and say: ♥♥♥♥ the AI drivers with a force of a thousand suns. They are among the most suicidal and idiotic computer AI I've had the misfortune of playing with. They refuse to give you the right of way, they refuse to stop while you're turning out (and cause some much unneeded fines/damage), they are literally douches in general. Come to think about it, isn't that a sadly accurate simulation of most drivers nowadays?The good news is, you can disable the AI by playing on a multiplayer server. You have to download this ETS2 Multiplayer[ets2mp.com] client. Do note that you may need to downgrade your game version in order to run this - thankfully, older ETS2 game versions are preserved as ""betas"" in Steam for that purpose. The only downside is that you aren't allowed to auto-park your truck on these servers, and I can tell you this first-hand, parking is HARD.Time to end off with a few funny anecdotes: This is actually quite a fun game to stream gameplay of, both for the streamer and for the viewer. Especially when the streamer reads chat while driving, gets distracted and goes pinball trucking off the road rails and/or trees! Another fun thing to do, if the streamer hasn't changed default controls, is to ask him to use camera mode 8. If you have this game, you'll know what it does. Then see how long he goes without crashing. HAHA!When to buyGame has been bundled a few times. The most recent bundle, as far as I know, did not contain any DLC. Try to wait for the Collector's Bundle to hit a sale.As far as DLC recommendations go, I'd recommend as bare minimum the High Power Cargo Pack and the Going East expansions. The Scandinavia expansion seems great too (note that I don't actually have it at this point though).8.5/10I originally intended to write this review as a thank you to my friend Oddllama, who graciously gifted me this game and a ton of DLC, for his website revamp...but then he shut his website down. Boooooooooooooooo! :( "

												Euro Truck simulator 2 is a 'special' game because of it tendencies to make the player drift off into a world where you only have to focus on one thing: Driving. The game is unique as it delivers an experience that no other game ive played offers such as: Graphics that are simply breathtaking when on the specific high setting, the amount of attention to detain put into this game and it's world shows enomous dedication and a good eye, although the cities arent the actual size that probably should be, the major cities are quite realistic and have that original feel to them.The mechanics of the game are quite fair as if you speed you get a ticket, break rules: ticket and ect. The game is fairly good with its mechanics physics wise, I have yet to see a time where my truck has slingshoted out into the air. You can do everything that a truck can mostly do such as honk the horn, indicate, fill up with fuel (essential), cruise control, lights, manual gearboxes... the works essentially.The most unique thing about this game is that since it is just about driving, it has the sense of meditation or zen to it, usually I feel after playing an hour of the game refreshed or it clears your mind, it's also great before sleep as with other games where you find you are always looking around for dangers or involving yourself too much in typing or whatever, in this game it's simple, stressfree and overall very enjoyable. This game is great for all ages and especially those who are truck enthusiasts, people who dont mind sitting down for an hour or two and just relax will love the game and everything in it. The combination of just driving through the beautiful landscape is fully worth the money to look at and there is a wide selection of trucks to choose as well.Overall, I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to all who look at the game and this review, and to all that buy the game:HAPPY DRIVING!(For those out of 10 enthusiasts)10/10			"

												This game is great! Suprisingly addictive, and fun to play driving trucks around - though some trucks are more fun to drive than others :) I've enjoyed playing it both on the keyboard interface (takes some getting used to, but after a few crashes you get on top of the sensitivity) as well as with a steering wheel lately (full feedback, engine rumbling experience!)I think it could seriously be improved by adding achievements, putting short term goals for slowly driving every road, buying every garage, and becoming a multimillionaire (though money in this game is simply so you can buy more trucks, and keep driving).*EDITED TO ADD* Achievements have been added to the game to give you short-term and long-term goals for which I give a HUGE thumbs up to the devs for!-- BEST SIM GAME EVER --			"

												Let me get this straight, I ve played many games, all kinds, some with hardcore gameplay, realistic at it's best with a learning curve who spans for years. from Tribes to Quake Team fortress, and old RPGs from Daggerfall to Witcher 2.Bought it because it was kinda cheap and I must say that Euro Truck simulator 2 is one of the most addictive and immersive games I've ever played.Not too realistic, no damage visible on car, no explosions when you're carring some petrol or acid.It's not spectacular at all, it's slow.The most important (to me) factor who contributes on fun and enjoyement is exploration, and Euro truck with or without map mods is one of the biggest open world, with nice variety very good landscapes and a sense of detail on environment, road works, trains, farms, small villages, forests, mountain trails it takes about 1 hour and a half, maybe more to cross the map from one point in Europe to the opposite. the driving model is very solid, not as complex as car sims like Asseto corsa or GTR2 but it's there, sometimes it's slipperly, your truck may collapse, you have to be aware check your rear view mirrors, incoming cars trucks, reckless cars, speed limits and so on..Everything is there, almost - turn indicators, windshield wipers, gas, repairs, day night cycle, weather effects, fatigue you can buy trucks, upgrade them. you have different jobs, with precious trailers, fast deliveries, long hauls you can also make your own company, hire drivers and you travel across many countries in Europe. and that's it.You can grab some graphic mods to enhance the experience, many mods are avaliable from traffic, to econmy mods and many maps.Exploration and real enjoyement are there, it's a different kind, the gameplay on the pad is great to with vibrations who emulates the force feed back who is usually on wheels.And to add, SCS is a great company, generous upgrades graphics maps, trucks, close information to the community I really didn't excepted such a gem, it's a refreshing change, relaxing and interesting gameplay with almost no flaws at all.Try it.

												Goodness these SCS simulators really give ""Time is flying by"" a whole new meaning. I have played these trucking games since 18 WOS first came out to market. I was hooked ever since. I would kill the sound for the game and just listen to my iTunes play. It served my in game radio. The game is so immersive, after a period of playing I would notice hours have passed by. Then I would say ""one last load"" and after that ""eh, one more wouldn't hurt"".ETS 2 is a good step away from the American trucking scene for awhile, while the new simulator is in development. Learning some of the roads in the game and seeing the large maps. The DLC, the skin packs, the truck add-ons, everything that keeps me coming back for more. The career driving is still great with some added features. I did not play the first one so I do not know if they were in there. However you can now add skills to your driver that will make your earnings rise. You can have garages to hire drivers and station them in a town/city. It just goes to show that while you are grinding away, load after load, there is still something to work for. I recommend not playing with any money mods as that may take away some of the fun of looking forward to your next purchases. Currently I have just 2 drivers but I am working very hard for more. It feels really rewarding knowing that I trucked those miles so that I could buy more trucks, more garages and grow my company. I recommend you play this game and forget about your clock because time will certainly pass you by.			"

												The thought of delivering cargo in a trucking game, sounds extremely boring. That's what I thought when I initially seen this game, however after only owning it for a month and logging in over 150 Hours I can safely say it's beyond addictive.There are many attributes to making this game appeal to many people. - Modding; There is a MASSIVE modding community, with new trucks, skins, engines, maps, literal overhaul mods that change every aspect of this already wonderful game to give it that extra spice that you may want. - Progression; My issue when playing games is that I only play games, that offer some sort of replayabilty. I want to invest hundreds and hundreds of hours into something and still have more to do. This game offers that. With the ability to start off with taking out a loan and buying a garage, then hiring drivers, to then bring in additional income to comtinue building up your trucking empire throughout Europe. Or you can start out taking small jobs from other companies, build income slowly buy your first big rig then launch your own company and hire truckers. You and each driver has a skill tree that you can progress into. Deliver heavier cargo, deliver further distances etc.- Map; The map is 1:19 in most of the map, 1:15 in the UK, and 1:3 in cities scaling = real world. In short, going from one side of the map to the other takes around an hour and a half. - Driving; The tucks have weight to them, you have to take into account the weigt of the cargo otherwise when going around a corner you may tip over and ruin your cargo. Mastering sharp corners is a challenge in of itself.- Online; TruckersMP has a simple yet intuitive tool you can use (Third Party Application) to play online. This offers a whole new relam of fun. Hopping online with almost all of the time a full server of 2,300 People is amazing. You come across convoys of hundreds as they all journey through the world and deliver cargo. You can stop at cities and show off your rig, chat with people via voice/text and this is where most of my time is spent. Overall my review doesn't even tap into the sheer amount of content in this game. I just thought I'd share some of my thoughts and perhaps get you to give this game a go. It's a 10/10 for me.They've recently released American Truck Simulator which is basically the same thing but in America, with new trucks. However it's quite new and is very, very small. It becomes quite boring very fast. However they're rescaling the maps so maybe this time next year it'll be complete with new DLC's to add to it.If you've thought about getting this game, but are on the fence. I would 100% buy it, download the multiplayer mod right away and play for a few hours. Don't like it, issue a refund. Cheers,RealSykes			"

												What can be said about trucking that hasn't been said a hundred times before. As my cousin would say, it's one of the greatest and most self-rewarding acts any human can undergo. Long winding roads, the ease of the motorway, getting a scratch on your first truck, the missed deadlines. Every town you visit is a new playground, a maze to navigate, corners to perfectly turn through. While it may seem a daunting and lonely career, the road and the radio will comfort you on the countless journeys through the boroughs of the countryside, the rises in terrain and the beat of the music are truly the greatest pleasures. I couldn't think of anything I'd rather spend my time doing... other than five on five multiplayer online battle arena combat, of course.			"

												I have long been watching videos of ETS2 on youtube, and what I saw, I was quite surprised by... The graphics were absolutely top-notch, and the physics looked spot-on.  I decided to purchase the game.  Well, what I got and what I saw on Youtube were two different things.  Just a note, this is not against the makers of the game, or the game itself, but rather, against myself for not paying better attention.  So, after paying for ETS2 on Steam, and downloading it, I played it for the first time.  I was dissapointed that the graphics could not run well on my computer.  I have to have the lowest graphics settings possible on my computer, and it still lags.  But don't get me wrong, this is a great game, and I would recommend it to everyone.  Maybe in the future ETS2 developers could find a way to maximize graphics performance for lesser computers...			"

												While the whole game world is (thankfully) condensed, most cities and landmarks are very recognisable. Driving is fun as well, depending on the chosen setting it can be casual or more like a simulation. AI is pretty decent most of the time, but sometimes makes weird decisions. Like a turning after a stop light can take forever when there is oncoming traffic, as the AI somehow can not communicate with each other.Roads are usually fine, some design choices are really bad, though. Like highways often narrow down to a single lane after an off-ramp.Despite that, it makes lots of fun. The management part is also quite nice, though I have not extensively played it yet.			"

												It's a game that can meet your wish to be a truck driver while you never do this in real world.The following are features of the game:<> Want to drive around Europe?Yes! A huge and real Europe map can make your dream come true.<> Unlike other racing game,you can't drive at high speed without limit.That is, you have to follow traffic rule.<> When you are tired of doing something,it's a good leisure that makes you relaxed.<> Multiple players mod is available.從沒開過卡車？想在歐洲開車看風景？會乖乖遵守交通規則？工作下班後想放鬆放空？想和朋友一起展開歐卡人生？沒問題！快來開歐卡吧！！ "

												this game is not really much of a game, but more a simulator(obviously) but it can be rather entertaining as well. if you want to know how it feels to be a truck driver, but on a smaller scale, this is perfect for you. the mods make it a game that will likely last for years, or at the very least months if you enjoy it. and it allows you to make a your own shipping company once you have enough money, meaning you can manage trucks for your drivers, hire more drivers, and overall manage the shipping company rahter easily.this game is best played with a wheel, i personally use a G27, but used to use a G25 for playing, but it is up to you which wheel you want to play it with, or even if you want to go keyboard/mouse.

												Game Score: 8/10*Scania, Volvo, Mercedes... you name it, they have it. Euro Truck Sim 2 is one of those games that you can sit back and relax while driving at the country side. The physics mechanics of the game works great, after all it's a simulator game. Europe is huge, with the map expansion DLC the map is larger than ever. Did i not mention that the game has tons of mods to play with and the most enjoyable ones would be the multiplayer mod where it allowed you to continue your gameplay as per normal just that there will be thousands of online players in the map which adds on to the challenge. All in all, a great truck simulator game but i am sure many would like to see that the trucks could have more detailed collision damage, for instance the wheel can get puncture or the suspension could get broken through collision.

												This game is great! Suprisingly addictive, and fun to play driving trucks around - though some trucks are more fun to drive than others :) I've enjoyed playing it both on the keyboard interface (takes some getting used to, but after a few crashes you get on top of the sensitivity) as well as with a steering wheel lately (full feedback, engine rumbling experience!)I think it could seriously be improved by adding achievements, putting short term goals for slowly driving every road, buying every garage, and becoming a multimillionaire (though money in this game is simply so you can buy more trucks, and keep driving).*EDITED TO ADD* Achievements have been added to the game to give you short-term and long-term goals for which I give a HUGE thumbs up to the devs for!-- BEST SIM GAME EVER --			"

It's one of my favourite games of all time. I play multiplayer mostly using the ETS2MP mod along with thousands of other drivers from around the world, but singleplayer is entirely great also, so whichever you prefer you won't be dissapointed.I play using a G27 steering wheel, pedals and H-Shifter for maximum immersion, and the game is compatible with Occulus Rift and TrackIR for those that want to go even further!I can't recommend this simulator enough, get it!Note: This should be pretty obvious but i'll say it anyway just incase...

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of those games that grabs your attention. Not because it delivers something utterly astonishing. Not because it delivers a big name brand from a big name developer with big pockets and licenses. This grabs people because of it's pure simplistic gameplay.To begin, you start off on your day driving. You work for employers for a set price, and one delivery only.  The game starts off slow but eases you into the game mechanics and internal workings. As you begin working for employers, and obviously wanting to start your own business, you can sit back and let the employer take care of fuel, toll roads, and of course, lorry damages.As you begin to grow in the game and earn some money, you have the option of purchasing your own lorry and begining your own business ventures. You start off with a small shack-like garage and from there you must build your own logistics empire!A lot of the lorries are locked out as you will find out, and so are some of the items for customising your rig. These become unlocked with ""levelling"" up. Consider it on the same track as, the more you drive, the more you understand how your vehicle and the road behave. So you can spot an issue beforehand. Once ""levelled"" up, more options become available. Such as bull bars, light rails, spotlights, beacons, wheels, axles, and paints.As well as driving for your own company, you have the basic management of drivers, such as hiring a driver, choosing what, if any, type of ""levelling up"", they should do to aquire newer licenses and new skills in driving. Along with this you can also assign them to any garage you own (more can be purchased throughout the game), and assign a lorry for each driver to drive. Of course you must pay the bills too.For a main point of note is the handling of the vehicles. Each lorry handles amazingly well under the Logitech G series wheels and Driving Force wheels. It is constantly being refined, with FFB as an example. you can feel the power steering on the rig when you switch the engine on (note, less stiff to turn).Along with this is a built in MP3 and internet radio player. Fully modelled cabins, weather effects, and more mods appearing everyday.Of special note: Any new trucks added by SCS come free in update patches.Graphics: 90%Sound: 95%Playability: 100%Multiplayer: 0% (none available)Scored: 98%			"

												Before I tried out simulators I had a very bad opinion about them. But since I started playing this game my opinion changed. I got surprised by the fun, although it gets repetitve, that you find in these games. The game is realistic, as it should be. The map is big enough North border is North-Scotland, West-border is from Paris to Lyon, South-border is North Italy and East-border is Poland/Slovakia. If you want to expand the map you got to get DLC which is expected. The downside of this game is that the AI may need some improvement. Some traffic rules are not added to these AI. I got 2 examples:I wanted to take a short turn right, I'm supposed to go first, and the car in front of me turned to his left or my right too and he hit me and I got fined while he was wrong.I wanted to get into a lane coming from the right. The car from my left just speeds pasts me and hits me while I was turning right. Then again I was supposed to go first, maybe that one doesn't count because I was coming from a highway but anyway it shouldn't matter if I remember correctly.The biggest feature for me aside the main-game is the music feature. It is absolutely amazing. It has it's ingame music while you are in your 'lobby'. You can choose from music from your computer if you add it to the folder of ETS2/music as an .mp3 file. But the biggest surprise for me was that you can listen to the radio in this game. Although not all Belgian posts are supported, most of them are which is actually very nice. You can pick any big European radio station if you want. "

If you want to shout at a computer for a few hours because you have been hit by a idiotic driver not indicating on a roundabout or have been caught speeding for the 100th time and you havnt even reached your destination, then this game is for you 10/10 would play again. ;)			"

												This is a very good simalutor. But it need to start renewing the things in the game if they want to keep this thing for the coming 3-5 years. I don't to see this great thing end up like TS 2017 (That's how the devs there call it).			"

												Before I tried out simulators I had a very bad opinion about them. But since I started playing this game my opinion changed. I got surprised by the fun, although it gets repetitve, that you find in these games. The game is realistic, as it should be. The map is big enough North border is North-Scotland, West-border is from Paris to Lyon, South-border is North Italy and East-border is Poland/Slovakia. If you want to expand the map you got to get DLC which is expected. The downside of this game is that the AI may need some improvement. Some traffic rules are not added to these AI. I got 2 examples:I wanted to take a short turn right, I'm supposed to go first, and the car in front of me turned to his left or my right too and he hit me and I got fined while he was wrong.I wanted to get into a lane coming from the right. The car from my left just speeds pasts me and hits me while I was turning right. Then again I was supposed to go first, maybe that one doesn't count because I was coming from a highway but anyway it shouldn't matter if I remember correctly.The biggest feature for me aside the main-game is the music feature. It is absolutely amazing. It has it's ingame music while you are in your 'lobby'. You can choose from music from your computer if you add it to the folder of ETS2/music as an .mp3 file. But the biggest surprise for me was that you can listen to the radio in this game. Although not all Belgian posts are supported, most of them are which is actually very nice. You can pick any big European radio station if you want. "

												Euro Truck Simulator is a delightuly specific Sim. If you are a true geek like myself and find solace and relaxation in driving cargo from one city to another, then you will delight in ETS2. Along with the extensive mod list, this game is infinately customizable, however, I highly suggest getting the ""Realistic Physics"" mod and enjoying the new and improved Hydraulic suspension. I'll be having some video reviews of the game up on YouTube soon if you would like to check it out!www.youtube.com/officialfarem "

												Why am I playng this game? I see that this game got a positive rating and decided to buy it. I mean all you do is haul cargo from Point A to Point B. No spectacular storyline. No final boss or anything. But for some reason I keep going back to it like it's a drug. Like I'm seriously addicted to it. The mod community is massive and they keep adding new things whether it is accessories or traffic or maps, among other things. Plus the streaming radio is awesome and they have alot of radio stations from all over Europe. Crusing down Germany while listening to 80's hits is something of a guilty pleasure. I recommend playing this game with mods especially Promods. That map mod makes the world better than the vanilla map. I noticed a HUGE difference in cities like Frankfurt, Germany for example. Seeing the Airport replicated perfectly is awesome (especially since I been to that Airport alot of times when I was stationed in Germany for the US Army). The vanilla map doesn't have those details yet (they might one day).  All and all play this game and you'll see what I mean. Oh yeah this game even has mutiplayer. But watch out though, those players love being trolls either smashing into you or driving over 150km an hour like it's a rocket or something or blocking lanes.			"

												This game is crazy, buy it if you have the money!Just for the record this isn't like any game you've ever played before. This simulator is like your second life where you aspire to drive trucks... You live this game, you sleep with this game on your mind, and you dream with this game... It never goes away from you, and it will always be apart of you. Trust me...In all seriousness, If you want to know what it's like to drive on the opposite side of the road, drive a truck from one country to another, back up a truck, fill up a truck, know what it's like to suffer financially with pain making dicisions, and fees you get from accidents/speeding tickets, then buy this game!

												Great game for people who really enjoy realistic driving simulators. Especially one that is well developed. One of the very nice things about this game is that they have a very wide variety of trucks to choose from, and a whole lot of customization to personalize it.       It comes off as a boring game to a lot of people, which is exactly how I felt when I first saw the game, but I still decided to give it a try, and I actually liked it which took me completely by suprise. You honestly don't even need a steering wheel of any kind to fully enjoy the game, I started out with mouse and keyboard and still enjoyed it, and eventually got a steering wheel. (Logitech G27, I suggest it to anyone wanting to get more into driving simulators)			"

												It takes every ounce of your energy to not take this game at face value, but is imperative to this sublime simulator that you don't.  Yes, it is a game about driving trucks.  Yes, the hauls get to be long distance.  If you're looking for something that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with non-stop action, this is not your game.However, if you're looking for one of the most true to life, masterfully done, in-depth simulator you've ever sunk your teeth into, you've come to the right place.I remember joking with my buddies ""LOL who wants to drive truck"".  Then a few weeks later, I find myself bored on a Saturday, lo and behold, ETS2 has a demo.  I'll give it a shot, what do I have to lose?  Just my entire Saturday.I can't quite put my finger on the exact thing that kept me playing this game for an 8 hour marathon session (I had stand alone before the Steam version).  Beautifully, accurately crafted European countryside is a brilliant start.  I plopped my trucking company down in London, as I wanted to tour the UK.  I buy my first truck, and jump right into my first haul.  Well, the minutes turn into hours, and suddenly I'm the owner of a successful trucking company, myself and 2 employees with my own fleet.  As you progress, you level up and can spend points on hauling more dangerous/fragile cargo, longer hauls, more economic hauls (gas/wear and tear), and more.  As your employees complete more hauls, they also level up and start bringing in more cheddar.My only gripe are the punishment systems.  I was expecting active traffic police, aka being pulled over for breaking the law.  However, the only punishment system is a series of fines.  A fine for running a red light, for driving in the wrong lane, for hitting other cars, and traffic cameras (which I'm told are quite common in Europe) for speeding.  No lost time in accident investigation or being pulled over, just a popup fine.  The only other punishment system is a damage system to your truck and trailer.  Damaging the trailer results in a poor score for the haul, and damaging your truck ends up costing you hefty repair bills.  It's also worth mentioning that it seems you get to a point where you make enough money that any punishment is negligible.  You make enough money on the haul where a few $500 tickets don't phase you, nor does a small repair.This game is a perfect getaway when you're looking for a lazy escape.  Throw on your favorite tunes, and get to haulin'.  ETS2 gets a 4/5.Apocky+Tawokwww.GuildLeaders.com "

												TL;DR - I never knew why people got Road Rage until I played this God Forsaken Game.and people in Red Cars have evil intentions.I finally got around to getting this game on this years Winter Sale, this game supposedly is a relaxing, fun game. I installed the game and jumped right in, I started in Edinburgh and my first mission was to drive to France, ""Wow, that seems pretty far,"" I said to myself as I looked at my map, ""this is going to be a long drive."" About five minutes passed before I first started to relax into the game, the controls were basic and easy, and the truck interior was pretty cool and realistic, but it didn't take long before some stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥in a red car cut me off as I was cruising a good 70 in a 60 zone, ""Oh ♥♥♥♥ me"" I said right before I came crashing into the back of the car. I was down to 1,400$ I was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥but I was not going to give up on this game and refund it, I started my truck back up only to realise my gear was still in R2 (Reverse) and I backed straight into another truck.My 1,400$ went down to 1,000$ and my 1,000$ soon went to 600$, god damnit I am losing money and fast, I checked my map only to be suprised that I had just got out of Edinburgh. I chose to stay out of large lines of traffic that day.It didn't take 10 minutes until I finally ♥♥♥♥ing yelled in real life because another♥♥♥♥♥♥in a red car cut me off as I was turning, all the rage I was building up unleashed and I found myself plowing through lanes of cars, no one can stop me now I thought to myself until I saw that bus coming towords me.My truck was ruined, and so was my dignity.10/10/Edit/Some of you seem to find this review a joke, I cannot stress that this review is completely serious and you should steer as far away as you can from Red Cars. This is real people, danger comes in red.			"

												This is so far the best Truck Simulator game but after a while I got bored. There is no reason to want to explore it's vast world, all cities are exactly the same with a few exceptions. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. So after a while this game becomes just a money grinder to get more trucks so you can get money to get better trucks so you can admire your trucks while you get more money to buy more garages e.t.c. I understand that you cannot actually finish the game but at least they could use the huge map with exploration treats and not just a yellow line on a map showing you have travelled there. By treats I mean some nice landmarks and landscapes, a few challenging roads, a variety in city planning and buildings e.t.c. If it had all that it would be on the simulation throne for quite a while.			"

												Surprisingly fun game! I'm playing for about seven months now and still not bored. You can make it has hard or easy as you want to, just by turning on or off some of the simulation aspects. It can be a very relaxing game to play. Just driving about, enjoying the beautiful scenery and listening to your music in the background. I often play it at the end of the day, just to cool down from work and all the daily worries. The game is also constantly being updated with new features and improvements. (A big AI update is coming too) The game itself is already great but there are tons of great mods available, wich make it even better. New trucks, trailers, maps, you name it. A steering wheel is recommended but certainly not necessary. You can play it with controller or keyboard too. Using a good steering wheel though is a totally different and greatly improved experience. If you have the proper hardware, this game can look absolutely gorgeous for a sim game. So... highly recommended. Happy trucking :)			"

												Very very addicting truck simulator, decent graphics and great feutures, the developers thought of everything all the way down to the smallest details, Take loans out at banks to help your business get started and grow, Plenty of jobs to take, lots of trucks to choose from, lots of upgrades to choose from, You can hire drivers to work for your company, upgrade the garage, etc etc, The Map is very very big as well with plenty of fuel stations and rest spots for those long hauls, You can even get fined if your not careful when driving such as speeding, running red lights, not using your headlights or warning lights with certain weather/cargo conditions, vehicle accidents, etc etc. The game has 4 or 5 different control sets as well for simple keyboard users where most stuff is automatic, all the way up to hardcore players where you have to control everything on your own in the truck cab. Overall its a very realistic simulator. Highly Recommended			"

												This game really has really good potential as a standalone game. But as mod makers develop and test mods for the game it just bumps the games realism up a bunch. Can't wait for ATS to come out and my Kenworth W900 will be waiting there for me. And a word of advice for you beginners out there start out in Germany it has a lot of close delivery points.			"

												This is so far the best Truck Simulator game but after a while I got bored. There is no reason to want to explore it's vast world, all cities are exactly the same with a few exceptions. If you've seen one, you've seen them all. So after a while this game becomes just a money grinder to get more trucks so you can get money to get better trucks so you can admire your trucks while you get more money to buy more garages e.t.c. I understand that you cannot actually finish the game but at least they could use the huge map with exploration treats and not just a yellow line on a map showing you have travelled there. By treats I mean some nice landmarks and landscapes, a few challenging roads, a variety in city planning and buildings e.t.c. If it had all that it would be on the simulation throne for quite a while.			"

												I'm driving my truck at night down a windy road near the Alps when I suddenly see brakelights in front of me. I hit my own brakes, and my 4T load begins to shift, making my entire truck slide down the road towards the car I am desperately trying to avoid. I hit the gas, and manage to avoid both the car and the hangrail just in time for me to continue.An hour later I arrive at my destination with zero damage, and park the truck backwards.Another bonus, and another cash influx to pay of my bank loan. Hopefully soon I'll be out of debt, and can begin saving for a larger garage and second truck.ETS2 is an extremely addicting truck simulator. I love just driving my cargo from England to Poland, from Holland to Italy, and back... it can be so relaxing that sometimes, I get in situations like the above. Making it out of a near crash caused by your own inattention is such a satisfying feeling.			"

tl;dr I didn't expect to like it, but I did, and I'm glad I did. If you're looking for a truck simulator, a good simulator, a relaxing driving experience, or all of the above, you have to check this out!Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the proverbial diamond in the rough simulator game landfill. Most simulators have hilarious physics or graphics, horrendous mechanics or UI, and terrible quality all around. It's an unfortunate reality that we'll have to deal with for a long time. However, as we all know, there are some simulators that manage to shine regardless of all of that. The ever-popular Train Simulator 2013/2014/2015/whatever it is now is the go-to for train simulation, and Microsoft Flight Simulator X is still the go-to for flight simulation (and it's just come out on Steam!). In that vein, Euro Truck Simulator 2 can be considered the go-to for truck simulation.ETS2 throws you, a rookie and under-respected truck driver, into the midst of starting your own truck company. However, you'll have to crawl before you can micromanage. The starting part of the game will involve you taking ""quick jobs"" across Europe for meager amounts of cash. Truth be told, I can't do this for long at one time before I start to get tired and have to quit the game, but I suppose that's partly the point of it. Eventually, the money you earn will be put to use in purchasing your own trucks and garages and expanding your empire. Oh, and fuel. Can't forget about that fuel.The thing is, doing these quick jobs is actually really calming. In real life, I've done light driving to begin preparing for my license exam, and it's a completely different world. Traffic everywhere, people being incredibly stupid, and having to focus really damn hard on everything is just really frustrating. In ETS2, all of that is still there (AI drivers have slammed into me on occasion - at least the game realizes that sometimes it's not my fault!), but somehow it just feels so much more calm and relaxed. It's a lot easier to handle driving in this game than in real life - and trucks are notoriously more difficult to drive than cars!The graphics in this game are likely better than most games I have ever played. That is seriously saying something; I have rarely seen such realistic graphics. Of course, people who go crazy about graphics will point out the problems here and there, and not to mention I'm restricted to Medium due to this being a heavy load game (haha, I made a pun...), but I still think it looks absolutely gorgeous.The sound design isn't quite up to the standard of the rest of the game. I mean, some trucks have their own distinctive sound effects, and it's pleasing to hear them, but every truck more or less sounds the same to me. This is probably something that people who know trucks would know better than me. But what's there sounds good anyway. As for music, that isn't really existent. Instead, the game has a built-in radio that allows you to select an internet radio station. My personal favorite is Euro Truck Radio, a fan-driven radio station specifically for this game. But you can choose whatever you want, even something from here in the States :DThat's still a very minor thing, though. All in all, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an absolutely terrific game, and I hope to see more from SCS Software in the future. :)			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 from Czech developer SCS Software follows a series of previously-released truck and driving simulation games with a reworked and highly-improved engine that foremost focuses on realism, yet while also incorporating entertaining and rewarding gameplay. As most simulation games often suffer from lackluster gameplay, I was most surprised with with the game's wide variety of content in addition to the stellar gameplay and presentation.I enjoyed the game's simple introduction in how it teaches players the basics of transporting cargo from one destination to another. Even the game's control setup is highly-intuitive in how it explains the various methods such as mouse and keyboard and also the option to opt for an automatic and manual truck setup.The amount of customization options for trucks is staggering from parts like the engine and exhaust pipes to additional cosmetic tweaks such as paint jobs and placement of lights. From scenic countrysides to tunnels curving through mountain hills, driving your truck to and from each destination is always an opportunity to see more of the many included countries. The game's world is often vibrant with life from cars, buses, and trucks going about their business.The diversity of each country's landscape ensures that each trip is paired with an addictive incentive to explore every city and road in the game's world. Not only was I surprised by the varied amount of content and realistic gameplay mechanics, the game surprised me yet again with beautifully-rendered landscapes and cities. The most noteworthy aspect of the game's presentation is the highly-detailed truck exterior and interiors. The truck's dashboard interiors with dynamic speedometers and digital screens, which are even unique to each vehicle model, are some of the best I've seen in any simulation game.As someone that has always been interested in the simulation genre, I was continually surprised by the new standards set by Euro Truck Simulator 2. The developers at SCS Software have proved that the often lackluster simulation genre can be brought back to life with games that deliver both realistic and entertaining gameplay. Elements of the game's design ranging from the varied content to the customization ensure that beginner players and simulation enthusiasts will discover their desired virtual trucking experience. the majority of content is presented with the utmost polish and detail that few games are able to achieve. Put simply, Euro Truck Simulator 2 sets a new standard for the simulation genre.			"

												Nice relaxing game if you have a steering wheel set up and have the radio set up to stream your favourte radio stations(this is the only game I know that makes this possible so theres no need to alt-tab out of the game to change station or adjust volume). Theres a huge amont of mods available too if your looking for more brands of trucks or maps. The developers are also working on integarting support for Occulus Rift and I'm sure it will be the first game I will try with it.			"

												Originally written by myself on Metacritic: (contains spoilers) This has to be the single greatest simulator game every made. It's hard to believe a trucking simulator is as fun as this. I can't believe I'm giving this a 10 out of 10! Anyways; let's start with the pros shall we? So, you start off at the very bottom of the totem pole. You have 0 trucks, you don't have anyone working for you, and you don't have a home garage. (Although you do have a home city that you can pick) You have to do odd little jobs to save up enough money and reputation so that the bank notices you. Once they notice you, you can pull out a loan. With the loan you can buy your own truck and start doing better and more lucrative trucking jobs. Throughout the whole game you are upgrading your stats which allow you to drive farther, haul hazardous material, drive longer distances, haul urgent deliveries, and so on and so forth. Once you gain enough money, you can buy your own garage, and upgrade it. When you have a garage, you can hire others to drive for you. Now, this doesn't mean you can stop driving, but they will start to earn a nice chunk of change. (And you can control what type of cargo they haul)Now, on top of all of this; this game accepts mods. There are a TON of mods for this game; both user created and professionally created. Some of the mods are horrendous and will crash the game; however some of the mods are extremely useful and make the game a million times more fun. Right now, with my game, I have over 200 different loads I can carry at any given time and I can travel thousands of kilometers. (Then again, everything on mine is maxed out) This is not a game you will beat in one setting, in one day, or even in one week. This is a nice relaxing game to play.Since I did the pros, I'll do the cons. (Which don't affect my rating because they don't matter much to me) You don't have any damage simulation. Well, you do and you don't. It's a partial simulation. If you damage your truck high enough you will have a tough time driving it as the engine will stall out on you. However, you won't notice any physical damage to your truck. It's all internal and nothing cosmetic will actually show. (Even the AI cars won't show damage when you hit them) Other than that big one, there aren't too many cons. Each person is different though.I personally recommend this game to anyone into simulation games and anyone who is interested in trucks. You will not be let down.			"

												See that mountain, you can't climb it. But what you can do is run over people and deliver used needles and other drugs to different companies.As you do these tasks you go up in level and are able to transport more goods to other cities far away.While on the road you will encounter many different obstacles such as people just stopping in the middle of the highway to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off or the endless tickets you get for driving too fast.These ""problems"" are minor since the payment is good enough to make anyone happy.This is until you realise you need at least 480k to start your very own company with a decent income.Now is when you take loans from loan sharks ( The Bank ) which will put you in debt and if you don't pay back in time they will send you hate mail and threaten you to ruin your life forever! You can also pimp your Truck.I Recommend this game for the low price of 5 Euro/Dollars/Whatever, unfortunately this is not the case as the price for this game is currently 19,99 Euro/Dollars/Whatever. Aka wait for a steam sale. "

												I played the original Euro Truck Simulator to the death so this game is nothing new, what I do find attractive about it is how well they have mixed up and changed the countries. Playing in the UK for example on the old one using Euro's and using European Road Laws really told me they had no interest in the UK versionand made it purely to line their own pockets...After much putting it off I finally picked up this one and it has truly been an expereince!Short Review this as you have to really pick it up and play it!10/10 from me... a Superb Simulator! I almost can't wait till my Oculus Rift comes in the mail now!			"

												In the past, I've played previous trucking games and found them to be mildly amusing. The graphics were simple, the game mechanics were simple, the driving was monotonous, and the scenery was often boring.I can't speak on Euro Truck Sim 1, but I can tell you Euro Truck Sim 2 is very entertaining. I don't even like driving, but I love playing this game, listening to the internet streaming radio stations and often pausing to take screenshots of places I've been. The business management is fun and immersive. The customization of the trucks is beyond my imagination. The variety of trucks is limited, but there is mod support to go unlimited.The DLCs which expand east and north are HIGHLY recommended. You'll be in awe as you drive through Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Lots of eye candy.I do not regret getting this game.			"

France to England);- U create your own company;- Special events (Christmas event for exemple... Free Paint jobs ^.^ );- U need reach a determinated lvl to bought some parts and trucks;BAD:- 11 modernTrucks (Scania; Volvo; Renault; MAN; Iveco; DAF; Majectic (Mercedes));- No classic trucks;- No American Trucks;- No America Map;- No Portugal/Spain (and some other countries);- No truck damage model;- No Multiplayer;- U need reach a determinated lvl to bought some parts and trucks (yup, i got +- 400.000€ and i cant bought Scania V8 225.000€ because im only at lvl 11 and i need lvl 25 -.- )VERY GOOD:- U can fix the bad thing with MODS ^.^(and multiplayer too).- Sory for my bad English :P			"

You can travel all around the world, meet the places where you already been to, and remember all the great experiences you have experienced here. You can remember that fun, that feelings.. its so intensive i can see it again, feel it . Its sooo good. Oh shi... it made me almost cry...

												""Another simulator game? Its gonna be bad!""Well, it is not in this game, Euro Truck simulator is expansive and it does take a long time to travel from A to B, with real life traffic rules, you may get money deducted for violating.You are a truck driver, roaming across Europe delivering supplies, it might sound boring and linear, but this game beats Desert Bus. Loads of trucks and customization to setting up your own shipment company, it doesn't get bored that quickly and is a good time killer.Overall, I am giving this game a 8/10, enjoy and sit back with a controller, keep your windows open and controller in hand and joy the simulated environment across Europe.

												Euro Truck Simulator is one of the greatest, if not the greatest open-world simulator games on the market right now. At the time of this review, the Steam Holidays Sale is currently going on and the price is 85% normal, which is twenty-five USD. Pros:+Beautiful game, and doesn't really bog your game down.+Every trip is an adventure, and with the ability to have the radio, it makes every single trip entertaining. You can also impliment your own songs and play them from the radio as you venture into the wild blue yonder!+Start your own company, and rise to greatness as one of the best truck companies in Europe. +The game is very realistic, where you use your driving wits to get you through each trip. +Trafic acts realisticly, where cars will go into the other lane to get ahead of you, people will honk at you for being to slow or not going at a green light, etc etc etc.+Explore parts of Austria, Germany, the UK, France and many more countries! With the DLC, Heading East, you can explore even more!+Modding support!Cons:-The game is quite expensive, and you have to play a bit to get your money's worth. -There are a lot of things to remember, but if you're like me and like that, then you're fine.-You  must  set aside some time every day or so to play this game to get anywhere in it. All in all, I definately recommend this to anyone who likes roleplay, exploring Europe, or just like semi's. Pick it up on a sale and play to your heart's content. 9.48/10.			"

												I am a trucker. I have been driving trucks and hauling trailers since I was 18. I even have certificate of profession to show for as a trucker. To put it short, I know trucks. I have driven them for all my time under the hardest conditions - because I have driven in western and northern Norway. These roads are pure hell during the winter - and the winter is LONG here. Imagine blizzards, short periods of daylight, narrow roads twisting around mountains and over bridges to reach that one ferry that only crosses 7 times a day. Stryn Mountain. Hamarøya. Korg Mountain. Iceroad Truckers can go wet their beds. I am a trucker. After 9 hours on the road, I have often sat down in my Volvo or Scania or DAF or whatever office I would be driving at that time, to play Euro Trucker 1 and 2. Pretty strange. One should believe that after so many years, I would have had trucks and diesel too far up my troath - but no. I like these games. Although very simple and not that demanding as it can be in real life, they are fun, relaxing and addictive. It also helps that there is a HUGE community providing a high level of addons for this game. Can't wait for the Scandinavian addon. Let's see how much more demanding they can make it.			"

												Trucks fascinate me and Euro Truck Simulator 2 scratches that itch mightily.Different truck configurations with different load configurations all handle surprisingly differently and negotiating the range of town, country and motorway roads on offer requires a surprising amount of concentration and focus.And then there's the reversing! With just your mirrors to guide you or with the help of the 8 external camera angles. I've been waiting for something like this since I was a small child.There's also a meta game where you acquire skill points, build up and run your own garage, hire drivers, assign their skill points and indulge in the huge range of cosmetic and mechanical truck customisations for as many trucks as you have the gamebucks to buy.Then when you're feeling really adventurous there are mods.It's wonderful! Try it!			"

												Suprisingly addictive I started playing this game very skeptical and am not a fan of trucks or this type of genre before. After playing this i have to say it's nothing i like i have played before and i LOVE it. Sceneary isnot repetitive, it changes from country to country and is dynamic. Truck sound, interiour's and exteriou's are authentic and sound proper. Great game overall i i recommend it to anyone, evenif you have no interest whatsoever in trucks!			"

												When this review was written, I had played it for about 7 hours. This game is honestly the best driving simulator game on Steam. This game is so much fun and a bit educational. You get to drive a truck on tasks and get about 2500 euros to 4000 euros. Also, once you get about 100000 euros, you can buy a truck / semi of your choice, and free drive it wherever you want to in Europe.  This game is so realistic with the facts that you lose money when you run red lights, hit a car, if you don't sleep in a while, and if you speed. Also, if you crash, you can call the Road Service. You will lose cash and it will take you on a bit of a detour though. In this game, you can drive your truck almost anywhere in Europe. And, you can travel from Amsterdam to London, but you will have to pay a fee to take a boat. I would most likely rate this game 12 / 10. This is one of the BEST games I've ever played.			"

												I LOVE THIS GAME! I never thought i would be interested in a truck driving game, but this game is just too good to miss. The simulation is not only realistic, but has a strangely fun aspect hidden in it. I dont really know why i find it fun but i just do and i know alot of people out there are like that. The trucks are realistically modled but some things do need fixing. One thing is the fact that they dont have a license to use Mercedes trucks in the game which cant really be fixed without their permission. Another thing that is wrong with this game is the AI traffic. It has some of the worst AI tragffic i have ever experianced in a game but they add a fun and silly aspect to this serious game. The AI will be fixed in the next update but if your are buying it before then just be warned. Overall this is a brilliant game and if you have any interest in trucks or you just want to try something new, this is a must-have and I highly reccomend it!			"

												Great game and highly addictive. I really do enjoy playing this game a lot and I spend a fair amount of time on this game when I am not doing other things like work etc. There is 7 brands of trucks to choose from which they are:DAFIvecoRenaultMANMercedes-BenzScaniaVolvoBesides that, you can start your own trucking business in the game with buying extra garages, trucks and recruiting AI drivers to earn your company money to build a haulage empire. All owned and controlled by YOU! :). However you will have to climb your way up the career ladder and work hard in the game to reach these new heights as you won't be able to afford to buy a truck in the game at first in the early days. So you will take jobs and do errand runs for other companies until you earn enough money to buy your first truck. Also this will allow you to gain experience in the game which you can earn skill points to boost opportunities and try out several makes and truck types before going it alone. As much as I love this game. I wish that Ireland, Western France, Spain and Portugal were available in the game, especially Ireland as I would love to do some runs from London to Dublin, Cork and Belfast.My only gripe with this game is the AI traffic because it doesn't always behave itself and the amount of times I have hit them because they randomly stop on the motorway at times when there is nothing coming or the AI traffic can pull out in front of you when you are overtaking, leaving it very difficult to react in time. But apart from that, it is a well made truck simulator and I still enjoy playing it. So its recommended in my opinion.Overall Rating: 10/10.			"

												+The game has the most relistic drivering contorls possible on a keybored and mouse set up and would be great if i had a steering wheel and pedals. The mission/jobs time is also alot more relasitic than over games in this genre as they actully do take alot of time to complete, this coiuld also be seen as a bad point in some cases. -There are a few minor things whitch bother me about the game, one been the AI of drivers in the game, when i droove too close but not quite touching them they stopped causing me to crash the vehacial. The only over ""bad"" thing about this game is that the graphics are not the best but what can i expect from such a massive world. +- Overall i would recomend this game to anyone who wants to have a sub-realistic driveing experiance, this game may not apeal to the people that6 dont have alot of time to play.

												While American Truck Simulator is still in progress (release date Feb. 3rd 2016), I'm glad that I got Euro Truck Simulator 2. Originnally this game I bought was the retail version with the eastern expansion already installedd, but now that I converted it to a steam version I can get DLCs which is awesome. I got the Scandinavian DLC, Cabin Accessories DLC, and ofcourse a couple of holiday paintjobs. However with out any DLCs the game itself is still pretty fun if you're an American/ Eastern European driver where you are used to driving on the left-hand side start anywhere but Great Britian because although it is great to challenge yourself you will easily loose ""euros"" by simply hitting a parked car or even lightly tapping the fences...I've flipped my truck thousands of times becasue I turned off ""Truck Speed Limiter"" and with an upgraded engine and with out a trailer, you can actually hit anywhere from 60-110 MPH (96.6-177 Kmh). If you play with a 'keyboard' its hard to actually drive which is why you should get a Logitech or a Thrustmaster's steering wheel with pedals and shifter. Personally I like the Logitech G27/ G920.Overall it's a FANTASTIC GAME!!!!!!!!! 10/ 10                                               CAN'T WAIT T'ILL 'American Truck Simulator' COMES OUT!!!!!!!!!!!

												The Best simualtion game out there! Point set.If you got good enouph PC to run graphics on high--the experience is like actuall life. Even better with Steering Wheel and a head tracker system set up.Positiv:-relaxing, ""a stress releasing game???""-releastic, even if your a truck driver yourself, you would highly enjoy it!-SCS software is an awsome company, they share media internally on how things are going and how they do things like no other, they care about their fans and they wish to impress the most.-The modders are better then ever, it is so many years since the release of ETS2 and yet huge mods are coming on sites DAILY!! That is fan-tastic how SCS have kept it going.Negative(dont expect much from me lol):-SCS should expand, personally I think they use a bit too much time from update to update and DLC to DLC, even Game to Game.-Sorry that is all I have to say here lol.The Game is definetley a 10/10Over 400 h on record and still ""loving the truckin"".Download the MP if your new, add me and ill meet up in-game for an epic good time and ride!

												I played the original Euro Truck Simulator to the death so this game is nothing new, what I do find attractive about it is how well they have mixed up and changed the countries. Playing in the UK for example on the old one using Euro's and using European Road Laws really told me they had no interest in the UK versionand made it purely to line their own pockets...After much putting it off I finally picked up this one and it has truly been an expereince!Short Review this as you have to really pick it up and play it!10/10 from me... a Superb Simulator!

												Listen here little fella...My success story is: working hard for something you love by doing something you dream about. I came from rags to riches and now own one of the most influential logistics company in Europe. I own almost 100 trucks and 20 garages and provide working space for all kind of people. We make million euros per week and continue improving our services for clients. Ofcourse it didnt happen in one night... But oh kid... It happened quicker than I ever dreamed of... It all began not so long ago... So... I began my career as a driver for hire. That was my first experience with various trucks and differant environments of Europe. To be honest with you... I still sometimes ride out into wrong side of road in UK. Eh... why they want to be differant? Anyway... I felt that this kind of work will not cut it, so I took my first bank loan and bought my first truck. OOOOOH... and I remember it very well... it was Volvo FH Classic Sleeper. All in black with 2 yellow stripes. It was not the fastest or most economical truck in Europe, but it was alright... More than alright. It was like someone very special to me. We drove for 130km pulling heavy weights all over Europe. Then I bought my first garage in Warsaw, Poland. Not very fancy one, but good enough for bussiness beginning. Its capacity was only 3 trucks, but I couldnt imagine any more at that time. I hired my first driver - a beautiful woman named Stefany. She was good... Sometimes even better than me... and well... what can I say... my heart was empty at that moment, but that's for another time...Oh... and listen here, son... I wish I could continue on talking with you, but I really got to go... My client cant wait any longer.			"

												Melhor simulador da categoria na steam, sem dúvida alguma, seu maior ponto forte além de possuir o modo multiplayer é com certeza o suporte para mods da comunidade, deixando assim o jogador com uma liberdade imensa para configurar o jogo ao seu gosto.A comunidade brasileira é imensa desde mods de mapas do Brasil, até mapas que simulam estradas altamente perigosas. o primeiro mod que instalei e que foi recentemente foi o do mapa brasileiro, o nome do mod é Mapa EAA, os produtores tem até o canal no youtube e são bem simpáticos e carismáticos. A física do jogo é fantástica, enquanto você sobe uma ladeira ou morro, ou como queira chamar, você estando fora do jogo consegue sentir o peso das toneladas em cima do seu caminhão, no menu também tem a possibilidade de você ativar a simulação de freios a ar e muitas outras opções desde da linguagem a tipo da moeda no jogo, mas uma que achei bem interessante é o ""Consumo de combustível real"" o jogo é realmente fantástico.A trilha sonora do jogo deixa a desejar mas não perde notas por isso, com um sistema de rádios ingame podendo você por até sua rádio favorita e jogar ouvindo sua estação predileta, também possuindo suporte para suas músicas pela pasta Meus documentos, simples prático e fantástico.Bom é isso, lembrando que o jogo sempre está atualizando a cada patch adiciona algo novo, a compra das dlc's ""Going to East"" e ""Scandinavia"" são essenciais, mas também pode jogar só com o jogo base, pois o mapa é realmente imenso.Nota: 8/10			"

												First review I've ever done. Let's see how this goes.To start off with, it's an extremely addictive game. I've tried to explain it to friends but it doesn't do it justice. I can't pinpoint the exact cause but I have a few theories. It's addictive because:1) Tycoon aspects - You start a company and build it from the ground up, hiring workers and building up a ""fleet"" of trucks.2) Calming - It's extremely calming. You have a big interview tomorrow? Just ride around for a while and work out all your stresses. Seriously, this game should be called Chamomile Simulator or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fantastic wind-down game for all ages.			"

												Trucks fascinate me and Euro Truck Simulator 2 scratches that itch mightily.Different truck configurations with different load configurations all handle surprisingly differently and negotiating the range of town, country and motorway roads on offer requires a surprising amount of concentration and focus.And then there's the reversing! With just your mirrors to guide you or with the help of the 8 external camera angles. I've been waiting for something like this since I was a small child.There's also a meta game where you acquire skill points, build up and run your own garage, hire drivers, assign their skill points and indulge in the huge range of cosmetic and mechanical truck customisations for as many trucks as you have the gamebucks to buy.Then when you're feeling really adventurous there are mods.It's wonderful!

												Good simulator! Looks very realistic but need improvement on multiplayer - what I mean by that is, add multiplayer to the actual game.   Also, when will Euro Truck Simulator 3 come out? Other than that, Brilliant game/simulator!			"

												For a guy that has nothing to do with Trucks IRL, this game caught me, BAD! I have over 75 hours, over 75% of the map uncovered and I still enjoy it. Devs take care of the players, answer to requests and constantly update the game and add content.Good graphics, night/day, weather cycle, good physics, everything you'd expect from a simulator.			"

												Of all the games I've played, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has by far been the most surprising. It didn't seem like a concept I would really enjoy especially considering American notions of what it means to be a semi truck driver. But as it turns out, playing a game where you play a semi truck driver can actually be quite fun!You can play a quick job mode where you are given a truck with cargo and a destination and just go and make the delivery, but the real fun comes in buying your own truck, finding jobs, driving to your employer, picking up your cargo and driving it to your destination. As you drive across Europe you'll discover new cities and find new dealers and depots. Making deliveries earns you experience to unlock new job opportunities and eventually new trucks as well as money to do anything else from buying new trucks, customizing the ones you have, buying garages and hiring drivers.More than anything, the beauty of Euro Truck Simulator 2 really caught me. Driving through the vast European countryside and cities is quite relaxing and the game comes with a radio that will allow you to listen a bunch of built-in European radio station streams or your own music if you put some MP3s in the program's radio documents folder. Of all the simulation games I've played this one has by far been the most fun.			"

												This game is far more fun than it should be.  It's relaxing, driving around in your big rig to music from the many online radio stations from around the world.  It's challenging, trying to park your rig to earn that extra money and XP.  It's got a very nice progression system, earning experience to improve your skills.  Customizing your trucks with better equipment and paint styles.  It's deep, in that you can buy your own garages, hire drivers, buy trucks for them to drive and grow your business.  It's beautiful, the scenery is sometimes breathtaking as you drive across farming fields, through cities, over mountain roads, through the rain and fog and night time.  It's one of my favorite games of the year, and although I find that surprising to say out loud, it honestly is.  It's like the Elite or Privateer of driving simulation games.  Very much recommended if you want a relaxing but fun and challenging driving game.			"

Don't get put off by the other 99 percent of crappy ""simulators"" out there, this is worth every penny!I love the fact aswell that this will either look flawless on top graphics cards but at the same time can really accommodate for the budget end graphics cards (I tried this on my Gaming Pc as well as a basic laptop, it automatically picks the best settings but you can always tweak them.)Just buy it, in my opinion the game should be worth at least £30 for its awesomeness.10/10 One of the best games on Steam :)			"

												This game...Is amazing. :DEverything about it does what the name says: A simulation of driving a truck in Europe.If you like beautiful landscapes, and well detailed games this is a great game to have.You do not need a powerful computer to run this game. It still looks good with lowered graphics settings. Everything from customizing your truck, to making a company is easy to do. But, it takes some time to get money and xp. You have to drive, drive, drive to get your money and xp to build a company, but it is worth it when you are getting $100,000 a day from your drivers.The AI are a bit annoying, but adds realism since people on the road aren't perfect...The physics are not the greatest. There is no visual damage it you hit something. If you want something more realistic when driving, use a streering wheel, like a logitech G27. The best thing about this game to me is that there is a HUGE modding community that make amazing mods so your gameplay will be a bit more mixed. Trucks, maps, skins, and much much more are avalable on many websites that are easy to download and use. As for the price, it is okay. If you were looking to buy this, I would wait for a Steam sale to get it a tad cheaper. But the list price is fine. The DLC is priced fine too. The map for original game, no mods or dlc is of a good size and quality. Adding mods and dlc opens up your ability to go further throughout Europe. I highly suggest getting them. Overall, this game is a 100% recommend from me. Great graphics, great UI, great game.   (If you don't like grind games, this may not be for you c; )			"

												In the past, I've played previous trucking games and found them to be mildly amusing. The graphics were simple, the game mechanics were simple, the driving was monotonous, and the scenery was often boring.I can't speak on Euro Truck Sim 1, but I can tell you Euro Truck Sim 2 is very entertaining. I don't even like driving, but I love playing this game, listening to the internet streaming radio stations and often pausing to take screenshots of places I've been. The business management is fun and immersive. The customization of the trucks is beyond my imagination. The variety of trucks is limited, but there is mod support to go unlimited.The DLCs which expand east and north are HIGHLY recommended. You'll be in awe as you drive through Norway, Denmark and Sweden. Lots of eye candy.I do not regret getting this game.			"

You want just want to relax with something that doesn't involve death or killing for once.So you map ETS2 to your DualShock 4 (or other respective controller) and boot that puppy up. Throw on Liverpool FM or Nostalgia FM and just unwind and drive your haul across Europe on the open road taking in the beautiful scenery and peaceful landscape while your favorite music plays in your ear.Add to that the multiplayer mod and you've now got a convoy of your friends, which all mocked you playing the game days ago, but are now doing their fourth haul in a row to level up just one more time while listening to the BBC News station and weighing the chances of their driver falling asleep at the wheel or their truck running out of gas before reaching their 14 hour destination across Europe.You see other trucks on the road in the multiplayer mod and you honk ""hello!"" at them and they honk ""hello!"" back at you and you go on your way. Safe travels, friend! You think to yourself as you continue your midnight haul to Hamburg with your trailer full of ice cream and classic rock playing out your radio.Euro Truck Simulator 2: It's just so comfy!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Manage and run a garage, shipping everything from lumber to ammunition all over Europe, you actually get behind the wheel, get your certifications and level up to aquire skills, obtain money by finishing deliveries (which by the way you are paid and given xp depending on how you drive/time taken/how you parked the freight)  to upgrade your truck, upgrade your garage, hire more experienced drivers to help off set the cost of this company and its overhead. Listen to authentic radio stations from all over the world and experience pretty decent looking terrain all the while managing fuel and sleep needs as they arise.  lvl 13 driver13,000+km under my belt.

The truck models are highly detailed and drive like they should. The trucks can be further modified with various parts to enhance performance and aesthetic appeal. The Simulator also covers the very basics of starting and running a Goods Transportation company, which is fun. This has to be one of the few Simulators I see myself playing and not getting instantly bored of.			"

(ETS2 is a really fun game with good performance and plenty of customization as well as light RPG like progression. Sometimes the AI can be a bit much, and I am not sure if I can ever be busted for ""creative driving"" my big rig over the island on the freeway but maybe the fact that I can get away with doing this in a 'sim' is a large part of its charm.)This game is strangely fun.

												For me, this is a tremendously relaxing game. I wanted to be a trucker when I was younger, but things didn't work out. Now, I get a second chance without the real life hassles. Picking up, dropping off, long winding roads with lots of amazing scenery, all while listening to European radio in the cab. Stylizing my own truck, management of my garages, drivers, and extra trucks is just the icing on the cake. Playing with my racing wheel and TrackIR makes it all that much more immersive and enjoyable.All that said, I would like to see SCS put the work into ATS that they have into ETS to make that a great game as well.

												Coming in to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I was not expecting very much. However, despite low expectations, EST2 has managed to sink its well-oiled mechanical talons into me and awaken the trucker within. Slowly but steadily improving your trucking empire makes for an addictive and rewarding experience, making all those hours spent on driving across a miniature rendition of Europe a worthwhile endeavor.  The aforementioned, paired with the ability to drive along the autobahn without having to worry about having two tones of metal smash into your face at 120 kilometers an hour makes driving a relaxing affair. Additionally, EST2 can be played in a wide variety of formats, from keyboard and mouse to the full on steering wheel experience, with assistive controls everywhere in between, making it assessable enough for newcomers while accommodating for the experts. Overall, EST2 is exactly what you would expect it to be, with no shortcomings or unneeded extras, just a well-polished, addictive and enjoyable trucking experience plain and simple.  I recommend dusting off your feed cap and flannel shirt and giving this one a go, even if you are not a gearhead like myself. "

												The most interesting thing about this game is that it's concept and gameplay look, at a distance, like it would be extremely boring and repetitive. In actuality, it is kind of fun and really relaxing. There are very few games that do this. I also hear someone is working on a multiplayer mod which would be pretty awesome.To be honest, I think it would be fun if you and someone else could both drive the truck and take turns. And just sit in there and chat. As silly as that sounds...it would be really fun. You have to play this game to understand how any of what I just wrote makes sense. Honestly, it's pretty clever. On the negative side, the game is based around a big grind...make money, buy better trucks, work for better companies, etc...but it's all really the same thing over and over. The actual driving around and stuff is relaxing and fun. As far as the endless grind goes...I used to like that stuff a lot more in single player games back when the internet wasn't as prevailent. But now I just feel like grindy gameplay mechanics should be left to mmos (and mmos should be avoided, even if they can be really involving and occassionally fun). "

												This is awesome with an Oculus Rift and a steering wheel (it's still great without them).  Relaxing (until the traffic does something stupid or you miss your turn), detailed, and it actually feels like you're driving something big.  The leveling system is pretty good and you'll get more jobs based on what you spend your points on (Long haul trips, expensive cargo, dangereous goods etc).Don't expect your friends to understand why you play - You'll probably be asked stupid questions like ""What do you even do?"" , ""What's the point?"".Give the demo a shot.  It's fun and easy to pick up (different control modes / level of simulation depending on what gear you have to play with).			"

												This is a game in which you drive a truck around Europe whilst delivering cargo to various places… kinda sounds boring doesn’t it? That’s what I thought at first, but instead it’s been 170+ hours of fun driving and learning. Graphics: 10/10Once you turn up those settings to the max, you get to see the absolutely gorgeous details the game shows. Whether it be a bright sunrise or a small patch of grass, it will look really nice. They really showed how beautiful the game looks, even in lower settings the game still looks lovely. The graphics in this game is the best I’ve seen out of the simulator genre. Storyline: 5/10However, not quite the word “storyline” as this game offers none of it. It’s more of a progression system which is implemented as the player drives and delivers cargo throughout the entire game. There is no actual storyline that affects the game. It is mainly just a simulator for experience and pure immersion.Sound: 8/10The engine noises, the wipers, the indicator light sound…they have been perfected for each truck which is pleasing to hear. The only compliant that I have is the truck horn and the traffic noise. The truck horn and the traffic noise sounds too quiet compared to the rest of the sounds. Gameplay: 10/10Smooth and refined. From driving the truck out of the compound to parking the truck in the designated spot, it will feel satisfyingly smooth and refined. I’ve yet to play a driving simulator which offers the same quality of immersion. Price: 10/10This receives full marks and I would give it a higher score if you got this from a sale. Even playing this for 5 hours is enough for what the price is asking for. This is the most immersive driving simulator I’ve ever played and it is sure to please you with its realistic controls, beautiful details and refined gameplay. It is worth the price you pay for.  "

 Score: 8.5/10 This game is a gem which unfortunately has to tumble through the simulation genre with the rest of the ordinary boring rocks. Many other simulation games out there give the genre a bad name, but this game is truly incredible not only to the genre of simulation but to gaming as a whole.  Tl;dr This relaxing, addictive game is for anybody. Simulator enthusiasts. Gamers. Children. Adults. Men. Women. Anyone. It's potentially captivating to such a wide range of an audience, that it's definitely worth downloading the demo to see if you like the flesh of the game. And if (when) you do like it, you can buy the meat.  What is it? Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game where you lead a trucking company, at first making money fairly slowly doing freelance jobs for random people (using their trucks) until you can afford your own truck. The quickjob part of the game shows you the flesh of what's going to come within the rest of the game, it lets you get to grips with the mechanics of driving the trucks in game, and gives you a general feel as to what you're going to be doing.When you get your own truck, the real meat of the game starts to show as you can make much more money from jobs which can then be used to do a series of things: Buy more trucks (♥♥♥♥ yeah). Hire workers to drive your trucks for you and make you money (we talk about this next <3). Pimp yo' truck. Buy a big♥♥♥♥♥garage in every city in Europe and keep your freshly-pimped trucks in them.The main things here are buying more trucks and hiring the workers. Once you've hired your first worker, you realise ""Actually, this is turning into a company, old turbo Joe himself is under my command in his fresh little pimp mobile. I'm gonna make the big bucks."" And that's how it goes, you do more jobs, get more money, buy more trucks, hire Turbo Joe and Rod Stewart to drive your trucks, and voila, you have an exponentially growing company.There is also a leveling system in the game, which gives you a skill point for each level. This leveling system allows your to get longer distance jobs, hold fragile cargos, get bonuses for driving economically, getting to your destination earlier bonuses, and other things. The leveling system is good, but it doesn't add much to the content, just allows you to make more money for each individual job. That doesn't seem like a lot content? Okay, so you don't want to splash the twenty buckaroos on Turbo Joe trucker Sim 2 because you're worried you won't find enjoyment in the game?Here's what I'd suggest.Play the demo for an hour or two, see if you find enjoyment in the driving mechanics of the game, if you find it satisfying to haul a load of heroin (or potatoes) across Poland. If you enjoy these two key things that make the flesh of the game, the meat of the game is going to add to the experience tenfold as it gives you big goals to go towards, but doesn't make them impossible to get. How does this game make you feel inside? I feel like the sexiest thing on earth when I haul that big load straight into the delivery point. And you will too (if you don't think you will, try that god damned demo). Seriously though, this is an incredibly relaxing game. I find it really good for winding down after a long day at college and suchlike. You don't have to pay too much attention, just enough to stay in your lane and to know when to turn off. The game proposes a constant low level difficulty, meaning that it's easy to play and you can be great at it as soon as you start, but this constant low level difficulty means that you've got to balance between relaxing and fully enjoying the game and keeping your eyes on the road. In my opinion they've done a really good job with this.I currently find myself coming home and playing this over WoW, which tells me the devs have done a really good job at giving the game a pull factor, making you want to come back to it time and time again. Any mods worth getting  The Euro Truck Simulator 2 Multiplayer mod makes the game a different experience, replacing all of the virtual traffic with real life players driving across europe completing similar missions to yours. When driving long distances, you may go a long distance without seeing anybody, which may make the game slightly lonely for you but when you do see somebody, the humble honk of the horn that you exchange makes it all worth it. In other journeys however, the roads teem with over players, all trucking away individually but the united cause of mothertruckers makes everyone united in away.The winter mod is pretty much just a mod that makes everything snowy, and does a damned good job at it too. The snowflake textures that stretch on the windscreen aren't great in my opinion, but that's my only criticism of the mod. The Multiplayer mod runs this during the holiday period. Score: 8.5/10  Tl;dr (also at the top <3) This game is for anybody. Simulator enthusiasts. Gamers. Children. Adults. Men. Women. Anyone. It's potentially captivating to such a wide range of an audience, that it's definitely worth downloading the demo to see if you like the flesh of the game. And if (when) you do like it, you can buy the meat. I'd recommend buying this in the sale, reddit, or the dispenser as that's where you'll get the cheapest price (maybe♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.I hope this review helped you, please rate up if it did. :)			"

												This is one of those unique experiences that define PC gaming. Explaining this game to someone is really quite easy... explaining why it is so much fun is another matter altogether.  As with any good sim, the basic mechanics are all in place - you drive and deliver cargo to carious locations. As the game progresses, you can determine where to take that experience. Do you want to take on massive routes for huge payoffs, stay local and make quick, easy money, or build your company to the point where you no longer have to take to the roads. The choice is yours, and the experience is a bargain at three times the price it goes for these days. A definite recommendation!			"

You can travel all around the world, meet the places where you already been to, and remember all the great experiences you have experienced here. You can remember that fun, that feelings.. its so intensive i can see it again, feel it . Its sooo good. Oh shi... it made me almost cry...

And yes, I did do all that without using and cheats for $ or fast leveling up and etc.Currently I am driving in Russia in the snow with a whole new batch of companies, loads and towns to explore. I think I might buy a new truck now as the game has got the fresh new smell again.			"

												I'll be damned. You look at something like this and shake your head, thinking ""How is this even a game? This just looks like Youtube fodder for people to do stupid stuff in and record it for their channel. However, when you play it, you discover that it's an engaging game involving driving your truck from point to point, picking up loads and dropping them off. You drive really long distances and can speed, but traffic lights, lane directions, speed cameras, and clipping/hitting other vehicles can result in fines and damages you have to pay to repair on your own vehicle. You start out really poor, using other companies' trucks, but the better you get and more successful you are, you can eventually buy your own truck, which incurs costs for fuel and such, but you make more money as well.Then comes a bit of business-building, because you can buy even more trucks and then hire drivers and start paying them wages. They'll make you money while you're driving.  It's sort of a perpetual experience of getting more and more trucks. It can kinda go on forever and is a satisfying and peaceful experience since you can even play your own songs using the in-game radio, or listen to various real European radio stations. Once you get to the point where you're hiring several drivers and buying several trucks, you've basically done everything you'll ever do, but can keep on playing and doing this. I'm a bit too scatter-brained to stick to it past that point since other games beg for my attention, but this is a surprisingly good game. It's not a joke at all and a lot of hard work and care went into it.			"

												You start the game without a truck and you are required to drive a company truck until you can gather enough money to purchase your own truck. ETS 2 offers a range of different trucks and real manufactures with a few exceptions. Once you own a truck you can add modifications to it such as bull-bars and number of axles ect. While the modification list may be large you are required to grind up through levels to unlock other modifications that have greater effects on your truck such as engines that range from 350hp to 750hp allowing you to be able to haul heavy goods. One of ETS 2 greatest features is the detail and scale of the game world (SCS Software are always adding in new features, expanding the already large world and fixing bugs and glitches).			"

												What I learned from over a hundred hours of this game:- Driving with 160 km/h (~100 miles/hour) in a sharp turn is definitely not a good idea- Overtaking sometimes results in several... broken Cargoes- You can rage-quit from a simulator gameI didn't expect much from this game, because the Germans basically ruined Simulators categorical (no seriously, they did). So after playing the predecessor, I also wanted to try this game, although the predecessor was just ""meh"". But this game is extensive, it offers its own kinds of variety. Even after over 100 hours, I haven't been able to get into the whole cargo franchise stuff, mostly because of my own incompetence, so I can't really give a review on that part. Looks interesting though. The graphics already look amazing (at least for me as a Minecraft player and former Nintendo fanboy), including the changes announced by the developers. On top of that, the modding community adds a variety of changes to the game, including a mod that extends the world to Scandinavia and the Bretagne (For reference: That mod is called ""ProMods""). If you are looking for your own small journey through Europe, this is the right game, and for -enter Steam Sale price-, it's definitely worth the price.			"

I can't pinpoint the exact cause but I have a few theories. It's addictive because:1) Tycoon aspects - You start a company and build it from the ground up, hiring workers and building up a ""fleet"" of trucks.2) Calming - It's extremely calming. You have a big interview tomorrow? Just ride around for a while and work out all your stresses. Seriously, this game should be called Chamomile Simulator or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Fantastic wind-down game for all ages.			"

Once demo'ed you'll be wanting to purchase the full game and I wouldn't blame you =)There is good customisation of the trucks included and the developers have recently provided a new truck for FREE, unlike some other games we can mention.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is more addictive than you would originally believe. Although I played the 18 Wheels series, I would never have considered myself a fan due to the awkward way the keyboard controls move the vehicle and the questionable AI of other drivers. In this, you have the option of using the mouse which, other than splashing out on a steering wheel (which is now on my list) this is the best way of driving. I have spent many hours playing this and have lost entire days to this. From this I can say that ETS2 is a very good way of spending time on the computer. The graphics are not bad and the models are very accurate, benefitting from licensing from the big boys in the European truck industry (apart from Mercedes-Benz who are depicted as Majestic). The business side of it is quite good too though an option to see your other drivers on the map would be good for those who like to micro-manage!So, in summary;Good Points- Licensed vehicles (apart from Mercedes-Benz)- Good graphics- Business model is good- Level based system adds more of a challenge- New content added quite frequently- Famous landmarks are there like the Forth Road BridgeBad Points- Traffic AI is still frustratingly bad- Motorway junctions change to single lane for onward traffic without warning- Accepting that making every city and landmark would not be viable, the geography is rather poor. Especially in Scotland. Also, Geneva is in France on the map...So, with the game being updated frequently, some of the points may be addressed. So I would rate this game as 80/100.Update - 12/01/2016Following my original review of the game, a lot of things have changed; SCS have gained a license from Mercedes-Benz so no more Majestic, the game is still frequently updated and improved by SCS, the Scandinavian DLC has been released and some other updates that have improved gameplay, graphics etc.The Scandinavian DLC is immense - driving through Norway alone is worth the cost of the add-on let alone the fact you can now drive along the Oresund Bridge between Copenhagen and Malmo. The graphics have also been boosted to the point where the game looks breathtaking in places.Another thing that has slowly improved is the AI - it's by no means perfect (and oddly, since v1.21, it appears to be going slightly backwards again) it is still better than it was in my original review.Something that I have now dabbled in is the extensive Modding community. This has enhanced the game no end. From additional trucks, cosmetic enhancements, tyres and additional maps, this game can pretty much be played indefinately!The use of mods though isn't for beginners, a lot of fiddling has to be done and not all mods are created equally. SCS for their part help with the addition of the Mod Manager but it's still a bit of pot luck if a particular mod works.If you want to go down this road (and I strongly advise that you do!) then visit YouTube/Twitch and you'll find a huge community with advice. One particular channel I would strongly recommend to visit is Squirrel (visit squirrel.tv), not only is he very entertaining, he regularly tests mods etc on his legendary Twitch stream, Sunday Night Trucking and has a spreadsheet that lists the mods that he has used and they work well. Another mod that I have begun to use extensively is the Telemetry SDK which via your LAN, displays a dashboard on a compatible iOS/Android device. I currently use this on my old 2012 Nexus 7 tablet and it works quite well. Certainly useful with those who haven't got a display capable of 1920x1080.So while some of my original issues are still there; the traffic AI is still not perfect and the junctions are still dodgy (though I now use the ProMods 2.0 map which does solve some of these issues) I can't help but continue to play this game as often as I can. In fact, the only thing that will probably stop me from contstant playing of ETS2 is the release of SCS's American Truck Simulator in February 2016! And even then, it won't replace ETS2.In 2014 I gave this game an 80% approval, in 2016 I can't help but give it an even higher 95% approval!			"

												I don't know why I love this game, but since I've bought it a few weeks ago, I've put 52 hours into it. I drive a lot for work, and yet I end up coming home at the end of the day and loading this up to drive some more.Maybe it's the graphics (gorgeous landscapes), the relaxation (I'm a fan of NERadio House music internet radio), or maybe it's just that it's nice to actually get progression when driving (as opposed to the nebulous progress one makes in real life). Whatever it is, this game has something that makes truck driving an enjoyable & leisurely experience. Every time I play it, I consider actually becoming a truck driver...Oh, and the updates & additional content that the devs keep loading up is much appreciated! I'm sure I'll get bored of this game eventually, but as long as there are 3rd party mods & dev additions, I'll keep on truckin'.			"

												This game is awesome, if you like big trucks and like to drive all over Europe.Euro Truck Simulator 2, this game just gets better and better. With all the many DLC updates that are released, the game became more real. Now you can paint your own truck. The bright colors and different designs. I love this game and look forward to new updates in the future.After 641 hours in this game i still play it, and i really still enjoy to drive around in Europe in my truck and pull all the trailers there is. So i will still recomand this game all trip is a new. So it will never be the same, i will keep on truckin and I see all you guys on the road.			"

												A lot of people had commented that this is one of the best simulator games around, and dear lord they were not kidding. Booted this up, and before I know it, had clocked in over 50 hours into the game - and that's barely 10%-20% completion of the game!!! Who knew the simple pleasure of driving a goliath of  a machine all over Europe would be so addictive, and strangely relaxing. To ensure you waste even more time in this game, the developers just released a massive expansion of scandivia, in all its wonderful glory. And this is not to mention anything of the stupendous number of  mods out there that enhances  your driving experience even further.One game for which I definitely wish to invest in a driving wheel setup, which unfortunately would not fit my current setup. So am relegated to kb+mouse and controller. Still its a joy to ride those trucks.Definitely recommend to any fan of driving sims, and even to new comers who have never experienced a driving sim before.			"

												Of all the games I've played, Euro Truck Simulator 2 has by far been the most surprising. It didn't seem like a concept I would really enjoy especially considering American notions of what it means to be a semi truck driver. But as it turns out, playing a game where you play a semi truck driver can actually be quite fun!You can play a quick job mode where you are given a truck with cargo and a destination and just go and make the delivery, but the real fun comes in buying your own truck, finding jobs, driving to your employer, picking up your cargo and driving it to your destination. As you drive across Europe you'll discover new cities and find new dealers and depots. Making deliveries earns you experience to unlock new job opportunities and eventually new trucks as well as money to do anything else from buying new trucks, customizing the ones you have, buying garages and hiring drivers.More than anything, the beauty of Euro Truck Simulator 2 really caught me. Driving through the vast European countryside and cities is quite relaxing and the game comes with a radio that will allow you to listen a bunch of built-in European radio station streams or your own music if you put some MP3s in the program's radio documents folder. Of all the simulation games I've played this one has by far been the most fun.			"

												Simply Brilliant.This ACTUALLY simulates the game fantastically. Don't get put off by the other 99 percent of crappy ""simulators"" out there, this is worth every penny!I love the fact aswell that this will either look flawless on top graphics cards but at the same time can really accommodate for the budget end graphics cards (I tried this on my Gaming Pc as well as a basic laptop, it automatically picks the best settings but you can always tweak them.)Just buy it, in my opinion the game should be worth at least £30 for its awesomeness.10/10 One of the best games on Steam :)			"

												This game...Is amazing. :DEverything about it does what the name says: A simulation of driving a truck in Europe.If you like beautiful landscapes, and well detailed games this is a great game to have.You do not need a powerful computer to run this game. It still looks good with lowered graphics settings. Everything from customizing your truck, to making a company is easy to do. But, it takes some time to get money and xp. You have to drive, drive, drive to get your money and xp to build a company, but it is worth it when you are getting $100,000 a day from your drivers.The AI are a bit annoying, but adds realism since people on the road aren't perfect...The physics are not the greatest. There is no visual damage it you hit something. If you want something more realistic when driving, use a streering wheel, like a logitech G27. The best thing about this game to me is that there is a HUGE modding community that make amazing mods so your gameplay will be a bit more mixed. Trucks, maps, skins, and much much more are avalable on many websites that are easy to download and use. As for the price, it is okay. If you were looking to buy this, I would wait for a Steam sale to get it a tad cheaper. But the list price is fine. The DLC is priced fine too. The map for original game, no mods or dlc is of a good size and quality. Adding mods and dlc opens up your ability to go further throughout Europe. I highly suggest getting them. Overall, this game is a 100% recommend from me. Great graphics, great UI, great game.   (If you don't like grind games, this may not be for you c; )			"

												For me, this is a tremendously relaxing game. I wanted to be a trucker when I was younger, but things didn't work out. Now, I get a second chance without the real life hassles. Picking up, dropping off, long winding roads with lots of amazing scenery, all while listening to European radio in the cab. Stylizing my own truck, management of my garages, drivers, and extra trucks is just the icing on the cake. Playing with my racing wheel and TrackIR makes it all that much more immersive and enjoyable.All that said, I would like to see SCS put the work into ATS that they have into ETS to make that a great game as well.

												The most interesting thing about this game is that it's concept and gameplay look, at a distance, like it would be extremely boring and repetitive. In actuality, it is kind of fun and really relaxing. There are very few games that do this. I also hear someone is working on a multiplayer mod which would be pretty awesome.To be honest, I think it would be fun if you and someone else could both drive the truck and take turns. And just sit in there and chat. As silly as that sounds...it would be really fun. You have to play this game to understand how any of what I just wrote makes sense. Honestly, it's pretty clever. On the negative side, the game is based around a big grind...make money, buy better trucks, work for better companies, etc...but it's all really the same thing over and over. The actual driving around and stuff is relaxing and fun. As far as the endless grind goes...I used to like that stuff a lot more in single player games back when the internet wasn't as prevailent. But now I just feel like grindy gameplay mechanics should be left to mmos (and mmos should be avoided, even if they can be really involving and occassionally fun). "

tl;dr I didn't expect to like it, but I did, and I'm glad I did. If you're looking for a truck simulator, a good simulator, a relaxing driving experience, or all of the above, you have to check this out!Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the proverbial diamond in the rough simulator game landfill. Most simulators have hilarious physics or graphics, horrendous mechanics or UI, and terrible quality all around. It's an unfortunate reality that we'll have to deal with for a long time. However, as we all know, there are some simulators that manage to shine regardless of all of that. The ever-popular Train Simulator 2013/2014/2015/whatever it is now is the go-to for train simulation, and Microsoft Flight Simulator X is still the go-to for flight simulation (and it's just come out on Steam!). In that vein, Euro Truck Simulator 2 can be considered the go-to for truck simulation.ETS2 throws you, a rookie and under-respected truck driver, into the midst of starting your own truck company. However, you'll have to crawl before you can micromanage. The starting part of the game will involve you taking ""quick jobs"" across Europe for meager amounts of cash. Truth be told, I can't do this for long at one time before I start to get tired and have to quit the game, but I suppose that's partly the point of it. Eventually, the money you earn will be put to use in purchasing your own trucks and garages and expanding your empire. Oh, and fuel. Can't forget about that fuel.The thing is, doing these quick jobs is actually really calming. In real life, I've done light driving to begin preparing for my license exam, and it's a completely different world. Traffic everywhere, people being incredibly stupid, and having to focus really damn hard on everything is just really frustrating. In ETS2, all of that is still there (AI drivers have slammed into me on occasion - at least the game realizes that sometimes it's not my fault!), but somehow it just feels so much more calm and relaxed. It's a lot easier to handle driving in this game than in real life - and trucks are notoriously more difficult to drive than cars!The graphics in this game are likely better than most games I have ever played. That is seriously saying something; I have rarely seen such realistic graphics. Of course, people who go crazy about graphics will point out the problems here and there, and not to mention I'm restricted to Medium due to this being a heavy load game (haha, I made a pun...), but I still think it looks absolutely gorgeous.The sound design isn't quite up to the standard of the rest of the game. I mean, some trucks have their own distinctive sound effects, and it's pleasing to hear them, but every truck more or less sounds the same to me. This is probably something that people who know trucks would know better than me. But what's there sounds good anyway. As for music, that isn't really existent. Instead, the game has a built-in radio that allows you to select an internet radio station. My personal favorite is Euro Truck Radio, a fan-driven radio station specifically for this game. But you can choose whatever you want, even something from here in the States :DThat's still a very minor thing, though. All in all, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is an absolutely terrific game, and I hope to see more from SCS Software in the future. :)			"

												""The sun rises over over the beautiful town of Berg as I take notice of how serene the placid little farms are that wisp by. I am calm and comfortable with Creedence Clearwater Revival quietly strumming away in the background. My big rig slowly makes its way up the hill with purposeful intent, almost as if the truck itself is excited to see what lays ahead for us. As I smile to the agile and swift passenger car that darts around me, I suddenly wake up in on coming traffic. Cars, trucks and the like all swerving like schools of fish being assaulted by a giant tuna. Semi's are flipping over guard rails, tires are screeching as amber lights alert all to the chaos. Wrong way citations begin clicking away as I realize I probably should have had a quick nap after shagging that truck stop mistress. Maybe this low quailty cocaine isn't keeping me up as per usual. The sound of a speeding citation clicks away as I decend the hill, dodging more oncoming vehicles. Christ, when did that median show up? I've got some very important dry milk to deliver and I've no intentions to stop. A few more wrong way citations won't be that bad. Ah, up ahead is a break in the median. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the way the sun lights those trees is pretty. The poor truck yelps in pain as I yank the steering wheel towards the gap. Like a bull in a china shop, the trailer bangs its way through the gap and finishes as gracefully as a sloth dropping a duece in a hurricane by side swiping a small passenger car. Why am I always forgetting to check my mirrors? Why the hell have my wipers been on since yesterday? Meh, I'll just blame it on the blind spots. Looking in my passenger side mirror to see how much damaged was caused to the poor little car, I can see the fallout of my little falling asleep incident on top of the hill. Death and destruction lay there as a symbol to all...Never get in the way of a mans dried milk.""Deposition of Space Viking on trial for crimes against dried milk.SpaceViking operating under company Balls Out Freighters V.S. the Country of Switzerland			"

												This is a game in which you drive a truck around Europe whilst delivering cargo to various places… kinda sounds boring doesn’t it? That’s what I thought at first, but instead it’s been 170+ hours of fun driving and learning. Graphics: 10/10Once you turn up those settings to the max, you get to see the absolutely gorgeous details the game shows. Whether it be a bright sunrise or a small patch of grass, it will look really nice. They really showed how beautiful the game looks, even in lower settings the game still looks lovely. The graphics in this game is the best I’ve seen out of the simulator genre. Storyline: 5/10However, not quite the word “storyline” as this game offers none of it. It’s more of a progression system which is implemented as the player drives and delivers cargo throughout the entire game. There is no actual storyline that affects the game. It is mainly just a simulator for experience and pure immersion.Sound: 8/10The engine noises, the wipers, the indicator light sound…they have been perfected for each truck which is pleasing to hear. The only compliant that I have is the truck horn and the traffic noise. The truck horn and the traffic noise sounds too quiet compared to the rest of the sounds. Gameplay: 10/10Smooth and refined. From driving the truck out of the compound to parking the truck in the designated spot, it will feel satisfyingly smooth and refined. I’ve yet to play a driving simulator which offers the same quality of immersion. Price: 10/10This receives full marks and I would give it a higher score if you got this from a sale. Even playing this for 5 hours is enough for what the price is asking for. This is the most immersive driving simulator I’ve ever played and it is sure to please you with its realistic controls, beautiful details and refined gameplay. It is worth the price you pay for.  "

												If you are into simulators, this is a good one.Even if you are not, give it a shot.You probably saw trailers and some videos of gameplay and you may be wondering ""these trips take an eternity to do, what a boring game"". I wouldn't say you're totally wrong, but i still would say for you to try the game considering this:- You don't have to follow the rules. Do dangerous takeovers. Go on the wrong lane in the city just to escape traffic lights.- Turn off the speed limiter. Go faster than cars on the highway.- Put music on. There is an in-game radio with some good streams of international radio stations. Or just turn on you favorite music player and play the game.If you do that suddenly the game becomes a lot more interesting.			"

												I didn't expect to love this game as much as I do. I bought it on a lark during a Steam sale for under $3. I've plowed about 70 hours into it over the last few months, playing almost every night. There's something very peaceful about this driving game -- almost completely the opposite of the average racing game. It's about driving carefully, obeying traffic rules, and slowly building your truck empire. The graphics are lovely - you'll send a lot of time driving around, just looking at the scenery and the wonderful little touches that make the in-game locations look like their real-world counterparts. My favorite part of the whole game is the ability to listen to (European) radio stations while you're driving. I grew up in Belgium and now live on the West Coast of the US; as a result, I can now listen to the Belgian morning radio shows as I drive around at night. You may be skeptical about a truck sim game -- I was -- but put plain and simple, this is some of the most fun I've had playing a PC game in years. Recommended!			"

												How I laughed when I first heard about Euro Truck Simulator 2.""What a silly idea for a game!"" I thought, whilst mocking my friend Jack for appreciating the game.Well, now I'm here eating my own words because this is one of my favourite games of all time. The concept is so small and drab but the execution is excellent and the appeal is abundant. I've always been a fan of Tycoon games and ones that involve money/time management and the general growing of a business. In ETS2, you have to work your way up from a rookie driver doing local deliveries to a pro driver who is trekking across europe in the truck of his choice.The game is realistic, with great sounds and amazing physics. There are so many customisable options that add great depth. Driving is a joy and it really feels like you have your own job in trucking. But best of all, you're free! This is the PERFECT game to settle down, relax, put some music on and just drive and think. It's truly amazing and that's the appeal I referenced earlier.So, to conclude, don't judge the book by its cover! Give this gem a go if you see it on sale because I promise you, it will not disappoint! Easily one of my top 5 games ever.			"

												A very fun but poorly named game.  It isn't really anything like a simulator and a better name would have been Euro Truck Tycoon.  The 'tycoon' aspect of this game is very good and I hope for the next version that they expand upon it by possibly letting you hire & manage mechanics, dispatchers, etc.  To improve the simulation aspects I would suggest adding insurance and drivers license consequences for accidents, make accidents visually realistic (visible damage) and more catastrophic.  To further improve the immersion more diverse weather is needed (where's the snow in the mountains?), and consider improvements to the wear & tear mechanisms as well.  To expand on the arcade aspect of the game, adding police who pull you over rather than just auto-tickets would go a long way but also adding some sort of bidding-for-jobs against competitors or a race aspect (bonuses for early delivery?) would be fantastic.The driving aspect of the game is good and can be challenging, however if you are looking for a simulator then Euro Truck Simulator may not be the game you want.  The scenery in this game is gorgeous, and if you like working toward expansion goals you will enjoy hiring & managing drivers, buying garages and trucks, and building skills.   "

Its so relaxing and the graphics are outstanding.     Then there's the whole modding world out there. Adding hundreds of more hours of fun. I would also recommend getting all the DLC as well. The East and North expantions, ""not so much the skins"" because they add a lot more content to the game and is very much worth the money!

												I'm not a big fan of trucks. I certainly don't hate them and do acknowledge their enormous importance to our economy. So when I spotted this game a few times on Steam I did not give it much thought. However, nearly a year ago it was on sale and I thought, why the heck not try it.Oh dear, what have I done... It is so relaxing to cruise around Europe delivering cargo, enjoying the sights on the way. A very big map with plenty of roads to drive on and cities to visit. There are three DLC's that expand the map, I strongly recommend all of them.Also, while the game itself is very good, it is made even better with map mods like Promods. I honestly don't want to play the game without that anymore.Want some relaxed gaming to unwind, and have a (small) interest in geography, roads and/or trucks? Play this game!			"

												I am a trucker. I have been driving trucks and hauling trailers since I was 18. I even have certificate of profession to show for as a trucker. To put it short, I know trucks. I have driven them for all my time under the hardest conditions - because I have driven in western and northern Norway. These roads are pure hell during the winter - and the winter is LONG here. Imagine blizzards, short periods of daylight, narrow roads twisting around mountains and over bridges to reach that one ferry that only crosses 7 times a day. Stryn Mountain. Hamarøya. Korg Mountain. Iceroad Truckers can go wet their beds. I am a trucker. After 9 hours on the road, I have often sat down in my Volvo or Scania or DAF or whatever office I would be driving at that time, to play Euro Trucker 1 and 2. Pretty strange. One should believe that after so many years, I would have had trucks and diesel too far up my troath - but no. I like these games. Although very simple and not that demanding as it can be in real life, they are fun, relaxing and addictive. It also helps that there is a HUGE community providing a high level of addons for this game. Can't wait for the Scandinavian addon. Let's see how much more demanding they can make it.			"

												Really relaxing game. Pure fun after playing all those intense games like Battlefield, etc. Driving is very fun, though it feels that you need a gamepad at the very least to fully enjoy this game. Analogue triggers help when needing to maintain a certain speed at short bursts (aka inbetween traffic lights). Driving long distances can be tiring (just like real life >.<), and Euro Truck Simulator fixes this authentically by providing a radio feature that allows you to connect to real radio stations (of your choice too), lightening up the mood. Crashes, speeding, accidents do occur if you are not careful, so no space for much dilly-dallying (though I might say the game isn't terribly unforgiving).Vehicle customisation allows for very varied trucks. Even if you purchase an entry level truck, depending on the brand, it could be very powerful through upgrading, eliminating the need to buy another truck (unless it is for your company of course). You can spray paint your truck to look much better than just plain-red or white, and designs are more-or-less varied.A business model is incorporated into this game. You can purchase garages, which after upgrading allow you to purchase multiple trucks (at least 3 trucks can fit in a garage). To maximise the use of these garages and trucks, you can also hire workers who will be happy to work for you. Through this, you can eventually start earning huge amounts of money (or even lose money). It is quite engaging, but takes quite a while (I have so far hired one driver only after 14 hours of playing [without any bank loans]) to really start kicking, which requires quite a bit of dedication. Graphics are pretty, with nearly every road having distinct features and landmarks. In terms of realism, the game doesn't really do much to push even the weakest of computers, even at high settings. Road textures could be better, some cities look uninspired and lighting is a hit-or-miss, sometimes there is too much bloom and sometimes there is too little.AI in this game falls-back a little when compared to the quality of the other mechanics in this game. The AI is a little shoddy, and is exuded in narrow junctions or turning points and lane converging points, where you can have cars or trucks crashing right into you while you make a turn or suddenly switch to your lane, completely ignoring the fact that you are right next to them. They usually never acknowledge blinkers or horns, rendering them useless 80% of the time, detracting the immersion you get from this game. However, the impact is only prevalent in tight-corners or narrow areas such as cites. In highways, they are less of a nuisance.Pros-Great driving, fun especially with musicVery relaxingSufficient vehicular customisationEngaging business mechanicWider range of unique places to exploreCons-Poor AIGraphics not too great when it comes to realism (which sort of coincides with simulation) "

												Depressingly cathartic.Euro Truck Simulator is one of those games where, on the surface, seems like another one of those terrible janky simulator games farted out every couple of months. But actually, it's a very relaxing, low intensity and surprisingly satisfying driving experience.Some say it's the best Winamp Visualization ever; and they're pretty close to the mark.It reminds me of roadtrips and late wistful car rides in the night. That certain itch you had when playing GTA to drive as legally as you can, probably most likely related to the fact that there was a song on the radio that you didn't want to risk  missing through criminal neglect.It's probably that bit that got me.I don't know. You shouldn't listen to me. You should listen to your heart.			"

												I have played many simulator games and within that category, quite a bunch of those have been truck simulators. Some have been great, many have been disappointing, but in ETS2 you really get some great things if you like simulator games.ETS2 is not just about driving around in a truck delivering cargo, you also have to maintain a company in which you have income and expenses to be aware of. It isn't especially hard, and it's not meant to be either. This is game for people, who just likes to sit down and drive around in a truck, where you get great graphics, great realism, a bunch of options that will make you decide how you want to play the game and much other.If you think the game is a little boring as it is, then you can always turn on mods, which are really easy to find.Pros* Great graphics* Many options (Truck configuration and updating, radio setups and much much more)* Great realism (Weather effects, optimized AI, day/niight cycle)* Always in development - getting updated often and the map is expanding all the time* Lots of mods available (Multiplayer, Map mods, Truck mods, weather mods, you name it)Cons* No multiplayer option (There is a forum where you can mod though)* Needs a bit more traffic and better graphics of objects, but that will come* Needs a bit more radiostations (It has a lot though!!)

												Whoever doesn't understand this game, can go Truck themselves!In all honesty, this is one of the best driving games I've played. Whist it lacks the high adrenaline of arcade racers or racing simulators, it captures perfectly the power and feeling of what it's like to drive a truck. You'll notice the difference in handling with no cargo versus 15 tonnes of timber strapped to the back of your truck. The game really comes into it's own with a controller or a steering wheel (which I recommend for this title).  All in all you will get the same chilled out feeling as taking a drive in your car, but without the fuel bill xDThe game it's self is all about getting delivery jobs and completing them before time for maximum XP and cash. There is a lot of exploring of European roads/cities to do, and you can also start your own company and hire drivers to work for you! Personal Rating: One of the best driving games, worth having in your game libraryScore Rating: 85% - Trucking Madness!  "

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 - Manage and run a garage, shipping everything from lumber to ammunition all over Europe, you actually get behind the wheel, get your certifications and level up to aquire skills, obtain money by finishing deliveries (which by the way you are paid and given xp depending on how you drive/time taken/how you parked the freight)  to upgrade your truck, upgrade your garage, hire more experienced drivers to help off set the cost of this company and its overhead. Listen to authentic radio stations from all over the world and experience pretty decent looking terrain all the while managing fuel and sleep needs as they arise.  lvl 13 driver13,000+km under my belt.

												Coming in to Euro Truck Simulator 2 I was not expecting very much. However, despite low expectations, EST2 has managed to sink its well-oiled mechanical talons into me and awaken the trucker within. Slowly but steadily improving your trucking empire makes for an addictive and rewarding experience, making all those hours spent on driving across a miniature rendition of Europe a worthwhile endeavor.  The aforementioned, paired with the ability to drive along the autobahn without having to worry about having two tones of metal smash into your face at 120 kilometers an hour makes driving a relaxing affair. Additionally, EST2 can be played in a wide variety of formats, from keyboard and mouse to the full on steering wheel experience, with assistive controls everywhere in between, making it assessable enough for newcomers while accommodating for the experts. Overall, EST2 is exactly what you would expect it to be, with no shortcomings or unneeded extras, just a well-polished, addictive and enjoyable trucking experience plain and simple.  I recommend dusting off your feed cap and flannel shirt and giving this one a go, even if you are not a gearhead like myself. "

												A nice relaxing truck driving sim.  Some might dismiss it as something ridiculously boring, but it's more than you think.  It's well made by a small Czech developer with years of experience in the trucking sim, so this is top tier in the simulator genre.  There's plenty of nice scenery (including landmarks) to be had in a compressed, yet varied, map of Central Europe and the UK.  Best experienced with a driving wheel, but it's very playable with keyboard controls.			"

(ETS2 is a really fun game with good performance and plenty of customization as well as light RPG like progression. Sometimes the AI can be a bit much, and I am not sure if I can ever be busted for ""creative driving"" my big rig over the island on the freeway but maybe the fact that I can get away with doing this in a 'sim' is a large part of its charm.)This game is strangely fun.

That's the kind of thing you wanna do after a stressful day at work, cruising in a big truck while listening to German or other European radio stations according to the country you're traveling through. Two thumbs up!PS: Even if I bought it on sale this is going to be a bigger investment. I need to get me a decent steering wheel with pedals. :)			"

												You start the game without a truck and you are required to drive a company truck until you can gather enough money to purchase your own truck. ETS 2 offers a range of different trucks and real manufactures with a few exceptions. Once you own a truck you can add modifications to it such as bull-bars and number of axles ect. While the modification list may be large you are required to grind up through levels to unlock other modifications that have greater effects on your truck such as engines that range from 350hp to 750hp allowing you to be able to haul heavy goods. One of ETS 2 greatest features is the detail and scale of the game world (SCS Software are always adding in new features, expanding the already large world and fixing bugs and glitches).			"

												What I learned from over a hundred hours of this game:- Driving with 160 km/h (~100 miles/hour) in a sharp turn is definitely not a good idea- Overtaking sometimes results in several... broken Cargoes- You can rage-quit from a simulator gameI didn't expect much from this game, because the Germans basically ruined Simulators categorical (no seriously, they did). So after playing the predecessor, I also wanted to try this game, although the predecessor was just ""meh"". But this game is extensive, it offers its own kinds of variety. Even after over 100 hours, I haven't been able to get into the whole cargo franchise stuff, mostly because of my own incompetence, so I can't really give a review on that part. Looks interesting though. The graphics already look amazing (at least for me as a Minecraft player and former Nintendo fanboy), including the changes announced by the developers. On top of that, the modding community adds a variety of changes to the game, including a mod that extends the world to Scandinavia and the Bretagne (For reference: That mod is called ""ProMods""). If you are looking for your own small journey through Europe, this is the right game, and for -enter Steam Sale price-, it's definitely worth the price.			"

Even better with Steering Wheel and a head tracker system set up.Positiv:-relaxing, ""a stress releasing game???""-releastic, even if your a truck driver yourself, you would highly enjoy it!-SCS software is an awsome company, they share media internally on how things are going and how they do things like no other, they care about their fans and they wish to impress the most.-The modders are better then ever, it is so many years since the release of ETS2 and yet huge mods are coming on sites DAILY!! That is fan-tastic how SCS have kept it going.Negative(dont expect much from me lol):-SCS should expand, personally I think they use a bit too much time from update to update and DLC to DLC, even Game to Game.-Sorry that is all I have to say here lol.The Game is definetley a 10/10Over 400 h on record and still ""loving the truckin"".Download the MP if your new, add me and ill meet up in-game for an epic good time and ride!

												This game is one of the best games you will play almost guarnteed. It is very relaxing to have nice long drives across Europe and taking in nice scenery while listening to one of the internet radio stations built into the game. (especially in austria and the alps) Also the business part of the game is one reason why you don't want to stop playing. You want more money from the time you purchase your first truck and start working for yourself, to buying better more powerful trucks and customizing. Also you'll always want to buy more garages and hire more workers for more money! I would give this awesome game 10/10!			"

Seriously, this game is a simulator of trucking in Europe (not including Iberia or most of Northern and Eastern Europe) and with the financing challenges, immaculate truck models, and amazing physics, you will feel delighted at the end of the day, with thousands made and lost.

												Listen here little fella...My success story is: working hard for something you love by doing something you dream about. I came from rags to riches and now own one of the most influential logistics company in Europe. I own almost 100 trucks and 20 garages and provide working space for all kind of people. We make million euros per week and continue improving our services for clients. Ofcourse it didnt happen in one night... But oh kid... It happened quicker than I ever dreamed of... It all began not so long ago... So... I began my career as a driver for hire. That was my first experience with various trucks and differant environments of Europe. To be honest with you... I still sometimes ride out into wrong side of road in UK. Eh... why they want to be differant? Anyway... I felt that this kind of work will not cut it, so I took my first bank loan and bought my first truck. OOOOOH... and I remember it very well... it was Volvo FH Classic Sleeper. All in black with 2 yellow stripes. It was not the fastest or most economical truck in Europe, but it was alright... More than alright. It was like someone very special to me. We drove for 130km pulling heavy weights all over Europe. Then I bought my first garage in Warsaw, Poland. Not very fancy one, but good enough for bussiness beginning. Its capacity was only 3 trucks, but I couldnt imagine any more at that time. I hired my first driver - a beautiful woman named Stefany. She was good... Sometimes even better than me... and well... what can I say... my heart was empty at that moment, but that's for another time...Oh... and listen here, son... I wish I could continue on talking with you, but I really got to go... My client cant wait any longer.			"

												      For the past few years, the JRPG genre has been seeing a dry spell, as many titles have sacrificed interesting characters and plot for fancy graphics and allowing several characters to fall into common and unwanted tropes. Additionally, many companies no longer localize their titles for the U.S. and Europe due to their belief that their games will not sell well enough in the other countries. For example, Square Enix's Final Fantasy series began as a JRPG true to its roots, instantly becoming a cult classic. In recent titles, however, there has been an influx of cinematics and high fidelity graphics, all of which are seemingly the trade-off for the qualities lost. Many things that defined the genre and made the stories and gameplay interesting were lost as JRPGs got more and more caught up in the ""new and fresh"" looks and styles in more modern titles.      Despite the apparent loss in quality in JRPGs, the genre is very much alive and well! Euro Truck Simulator 2 came out only a year ago, and yet it is proving itself to be a JRPG true to its elements. The story progression feels real and well-paced. The characters feel very human and never fall into any of the stereotypical roles filled by JRPG characters ( i.e. the edgy one, the tsundere one, the emotionless one, etc etc). This is in part due to the fantastic voice acting by great signature voices such as Nolan North, Troy Baker, and Danny Devito. I praise this, yet I would go as far to say that the game is just as good without any voice acting, but I digress. The gameplay in Euro Truck Simulator 2 blows every AAA title in recent years out of the water. So many puzzles and combat mechanics in the game are well refined and done so with the story in mind.      Overall, I could not recommend this game any more to any true die hard fan of the JRPG genre, or someone new to the genre. Everything from plot, to combat, and to graphics do not fail to impress me. This is definitely my game of the year, the decade, and maybe even the century. Kudos to you, SCS software, you Gods among men.3/10			"

												It's a fun, but kind of difficult simulation game that almost anyone could get into. I don't find it to be -so- realistic that you have to know exactly how to drive a semi truck before you can play it. You are able to download modifications for the games that will allow the realism to be extremely real if you'd like, though. My girlfriend and I use it as a game to pass time and so far it's done well with its assignment. ^^ The truck customizations are amazing, the traffic is kind of realistic with their behaviour and the hauls are beautiful. I overall love it.			"

I never get bored with the amount of customization and the various routes you are able to take on any given job. If you are a truck driver you will truly appreciate the realism this game has to offer. Even if you aren't a truck driver this game has something for everyone. The addition of patches brings just that little bit more to an already perfect game in my opinion. If you haven't already tried this game please don't hesitate to buy a copy I couldn't recommend it more.			"

The controls in the game and the truck are extremely easy to control even if you don’t play this kind of games. I personally think that this trucking game is the best on the market right now!9/10			"

												After 150+ hours, I decided it was time to write a review.Is Euro Truck Simulator a good game? That is all up to personal preferance. If you like simulators, this game is something that you will most likely enjoy. I love to sit down and listen to some music while I play this game on a rainy day. I love to add on lots of hours during the summer time if its raining outside or if I just dont feel like going outside. It just an all around great game.Another great feature of this game is that it suits every players needs. If all you want is to sit down and truck, go for it. If you want to 'tycoon it up,' you can purchase more trucks and start a buisness hiring drivers. The game also has many DLC options. Want a paintjob for the country you live in? It's most likely in the store. Do you want a bobble head dog sitting on your dashboard? You can get that too. And also enjoyable feature is the fact that the map is ever expanding. You can get the 'Going East!' expansion pack, allowing you to head on down to eastern Poland and Hungary. Do you want to test out that new heater? Get the 'Scandinavia' pack and get up in that chilly Norway! And soon to come is the all new 'Viva le France' that introduces a bigger France! Overall, this game is perfect for me. Sometimes I just need to pass the time when Im going stir crazy. And this is a great way to do it. For some reason, I purchased American Truck Simulator about 2 days after release, but it just never really stuck with me. This game did though, and I can just never get enough!Are there any cons to this game? No. If there isnt something you want in the game, you can download a mod for it. This game just has so much potential that is being pursued.Do i reccomend this game? Yes. It is a great game if you enjoy simulators, and id suggest taking a look into it. There is no going wrong with this game. Enjoy!-Dan			"

												I love this game. On the surface you may just see a simple truck simulator, but when you dig deeper, you notice that you were completely right before. However, once you've done so you seem to develop an affinity for this game, and before you know it you cannot stop driving trucks (in Europe of course). Theres really a sort of serenity and joy you feel when you put music on the in-game radio in a language you can't understand and drive around a country you've never seen but somehow can't help but feel you belong there. I'm pretty sure that's what love is like. TL;DR: Euro Truck 2 is love.			"

												To start, I have always been  big fan of cars and trucks alike, so when i was shopping around for a real life simulator, I saw this and said why not? The second i got into the game i realized that the people at SCS are BRILLIANT and spared no details in the set-up and flow of the interface. I think even you grandmother could figure this game out in 10 minutes, and i promise that you would feel that your money was well spent. Pluse the graphics are AMAZING and everything in the cabin works from the speedo andthe rev meter to the parking brake and the GPS. And best of all you don't have to use your keyboard, if you have a wired xbox controller or (even better) a wheel such as a Logitech G27 it adds a whole new perspective of life like simulation. But let's say you live in America and think it would be akward to use right-side drive (i am) don't worry because unless your base is in England the game is in left-side drive, AKA American style, so it is perfectly normal. Also there tons of mods ranging from truck mods to trailer mods and even enviroment mods such as the TSM map mod. SO HAPPY TRUCKING :D			"

After playing this i have to say it's nothing i like i have played before and i LOVE it. Sceneary isnot repetitive, it changes from country to country and is dynamic. Truck sound, interiour's and exteriou's are authentic and sound proper. Great game overall i i recommend it to anyone, evenif you have no interest whatsoever in trucks!			"

												Actually ETS 2 is not a simulator; its just a truck driving game. In my case; the trucks' physical reactions (for instance accelerating from zero to 20 km/h with 25 tons at its back); torque and braking power etc are not realistic. Because, you know, while driving a truck, you can't make speed, you can't race.. everything is more and more difficult then driving a car. The environment, the road reflections, the AI's behaviors etc. should be improved on ETS 3. Additionally its graphic motor should be changed. (CryEngine would be superb!) Altough all of these defects, ETS 2 worths playing. You will forget everything on your mind while driving your truck!The Multiplayer system worths underlining. Instead of AI, you have the chance to drive with real players. P.S: I strongly advice everyone to use a steering wheel set while playing the game.			"

You start of with a little compound for your own company you will be increasing later. Than you will be hired by other companies to deliver their cargo, which will earn you some money! When you have enough money, you can buy your own truck for in your own garage  which you will use to deliver cargo for your own company. That's not all, there are also other garages you can buy to upgrade your company!There is also a mod avaiable for download which let you go online on a multiplayer server where you can share your business plans with others or vice versa!

												+The game has the most relistic drivering contorls possible on a keybored and mouse set up and would be great if i had a steering wheel and pedals. The mission/jobs time is also alot more relasitic than over games in this genre as they actully do take alot of time to complete, this coiuld also be seen as a bad point in some cases. -There are a few minor things whitch bother me about the game, one been the AI of drivers in the game, when i droove too close but not quite touching them they stopped causing me to crash the vehacial. The only over ""bad"" thing about this game is that the graphics are not the best but what can i expect from such a massive world. +- Overall i would recomend this game to anyone who wants to have a sub-realistic driveing experiance, this game may not apeal to the people that6 dont have alot of time to play.

												The first thing that struck me when I played this game is the sheer size of the map. I thought it would be split into different, smaller maps but no, and the game is so much better for it. Add to that the DLCs Going East and Scandinavia and you have yourself hours of fun driving... no, trucking around Europe. Unfortunately there is no built in multiplayer mode but there are servers online, it just requires more setting up. This is one game that I feel is complete without any mods whatsoever, just turn the key and go!			"

												""The sun rises over over the beautiful town of Berg as I take notice of how serene the placid little farms are that wisp by. I am calm and comfortable with Creedence Clearwater Revival quietly strumming away in the background. My big rig slowly makes its way up the hill with purposeful intent, almost as if the truck itself is excited to see what lays ahead for us. As I smile to the agile and swift passenger car that darts around me, I suddenly wake up in on coming traffic. Cars, trucks and the like all swerving like schools of fish being assaulted by a giant tuna. Semi's are flipping over guard rails, tires are screeching as amber lights alert all to the chaos. Wrong way citations begin clicking away as I realize I probably should have had a quick nap after shagging that truck stop mistress. Maybe this low quailty cocaine isn't keeping me up as per usual. The sound of a speeding citation clicks away as I decend the hill, dodging more oncoming vehicles. Christ, when did that median show up? I've got some very important dry milk to deliver and I've no intentions to stop. A few more wrong way citations won't be that bad. Ah, up ahead is a break in the median. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥the way the sun lights those trees is pretty. The poor truck yelps in pain as I yank the steering wheel towards the gap. Like a bull in a china shop, the trailer bangs its way through the gap and finishes as gracefully as a sloth dropping a duece in a hurricane by side swiping a small passenger car. Why am I always forgetting to check my mirrors? Why the hell have my wipers been on since yesterday? Meh, I'll just blame it on the blind spots. Looking in my passenger side mirror to see how much damaged was caused to the poor little car, I can see the fallout of my little falling asleep incident on top of the hill. Death and destruction lay there as a symbol to all...Never get in the way of a mans dried milk.""Deposition of Space Viking on trial for crimes against dried milk.SpaceViking operating under company Balls Out Freighters V.S. the Country of Switzerland			"

												A nice relaxing truck driving sim.  Some might dismiss it as something ridiculously boring, but it's more than you think.  It's well made by a small Czech developer with years of experience in the trucking sim, so this is top tier in the simulator genre.  There's plenty of nice scenery (including landmarks) to be had in a compressed, yet varied, map of Central Europe and the UK.  Best experienced with a driving wheel, but it's very playable with keyboard controls.			"

												I love this game. On the surface you may just see a simple truck simulator, but when you dig deeper, you notice that you were completely right before. However, once you've done so you seem to develop an affinity for this game, and before you know it you cannot stop driving trucks (in Europe of course). Theres really a sort of serenity and joy you feel when you put music on the in-game radio in a language you can't understand and drive around a country you've never seen but somehow can't help but feel you belong there. I'm pretty sure that's what love is like. TL;DR: Euro Truck 2 is love.			"

												I love this game. On the surface you may just see a simple truck simulator, but when you dig deeper, you notice that you were completely right before. However, once you've done so you seem to develop an affinity for this game, and before you know it you cannot stop driving trucks (in Europe of course). Theres really a sort of serenity and joy you feel when you put music on the in-game radio in a language you can't understand and drive around a country you've never seen but somehow can't help but feel you belong there. I'm pretty sure that's what love is like. TL;DR: Euro Truck 2 is love.			"

												After 150+ hours, I decided it was time to write a review.Is Euro Truck Simulator a good game? That is all up to personal preferance. If you like simulators, this game is something that you will most likely enjoy. I love to sit down and listen to some music while I play this game on a rainy day. I love to add on lots of hours during the summer time if its raining outside or if I just dont feel like going outside. It just an all around great game.Another great feature of this game is that it suits every players needs. If all you want is to sit down and truck, go for it. If you want to 'tycoon it up,' you can purchase more trucks and start a buisness hiring drivers. The game also has many DLC options. Want a paintjob for the country you live in? It's most likely in the store. Do you want a bobble head dog sitting on your dashboard? You can get that too. And also enjoyable feature is the fact that the map is ever expanding. You can get the 'Going East!' expansion pack, allowing you to head on down to eastern Poland and Hungary. Do you want to test out that new heater? Get the 'Scandinavia' pack and get up in that chilly Norway! And soon to come is the all new 'Viva le France' that introduces a bigger France! Overall, this game is perfect for me. Sometimes I just need to pass the time when Im going stir crazy. And this is a great way to do it. For some reason, I purchased American Truck Simulator about 2 days after release, but it just never really stuck with me. This game did though, and I can just never get enough!Are there any cons to this game? No. If there isnt something you want in the game, you can download a mod for it. This game just has so much potential that is being pursued.Do i reccomend this game? Yes. It is a great game if you enjoy simulators, and id suggest taking a look into it. There is no going wrong with this game. Enjoy!-Dan			"

												this is the best smulator I ever played berfore in my life. I honestly have NO intrest in gaming whatsoever (I have other games but never play them) I ONLY play euro truck simulator and soon american truck. I take this really seriously I treat snd pertend like it's like it's real life. I'm even biulding a replica of a truck cab to make me feel more like a trucker with a driver's seat, passenger's seat, a bed (that I actually sleep in), a fridge, a cabinet, and much more. this simulator helped me find my passion in life, driving transport trucks. I'm gonna do it for real once I get my CDL and a trucking job. I even started my own vuirtl trucking company with my firends to make it feel more realistic with a logbook and everything. anyway let me start talking about some of the features that this simulator has. 1. massive map of europe with lots of real european cities and from germany, france, austria, UK, poland, sweden, norway, denmark, netherlands, italy,  and much more2. lots of really nice realistic europen trucks from europe such as Scania, Volvo, DAF, MAN, Iveco, Reanult, and Mercedes Benz3. lots of nice customization options for the trucks like lights, bars horns, paint jobs, wheels, side skirts and a lot more4. realistic phisycs when driving the trucks feels very realistic it feels like I'm driving a real truck5. updates are at least every month the developers are always on the ball6. lots of cools mods from trucks to maps to trailers, even multiplayer7. lots of cool cargo and trailers to haul around europe from refrigerated trailers to flatbeds to tankers8. the ability to add your own music and radio stations to the simulator to listen to while drivingif you like trucking at all then this is the simulator for you I love it. I highly recommend it and also if you from north america like me and want to drive american trucks in america then there is an american version of this simulator coming out on feb 3 2016 called american truck simulator for those who live in the USA 10/10 you can trust me that this is a great simulator I ""play"" (to me this is not just a game) everyday for hours I have almost 3000 hours itthank you for reading my review I hope you've made up your mind on whether you want to buy it or not :)			"

												Awesome game, good to just sit back and relax and just take it in. Control allows 360 pad, keyboard and also supports steering wheels. You can also have the way it plays set to full auto gear change to full on truck sim with manually changing gears etc. Music you can either drop a load of your own MP3's into the relevant folder or just choose an internet radio station to play in the background while driving. I have found REAL & Magic tend to play the best trucking songs as they tend to play stuff from the 80 mixed with a bit of modern stuff.Visually the scenery won't blow you away and you will notice ommissions when driving about your local city, it doesn't matter though, vehicles look amazing and the playability is right up there.It literally has the one more run appeal before turning it off, it is highly addictive and well worth being in any ones collection.

												TL;DR: Buy it, you won't regret it.Nothing can compare to Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's not somehting specific but a concoction of many different things that peice this game together into a beautiful mix of stress and relaxation.The joy of roaming the world at the start, working for others in their trucks is blissful. Being able to ding the truck untill it is 100% damaged with no consequences makes the later parts of the game have so much more gravity and realism. At the moment of taking a loan out from the bank and buying your own truck is the moment it all becomes real. When 1% damage costs as much as £1000 of your own money is the moment you get serious about being a professional truck driver and not a suicidal maniac on the roads of Europe.But all that pressure washes away as you are making your delivery bound from London to Luxemburg when listening to the volunteer run radio stadion does Barbie Girl, The Crazy Frog, Blue (Da Ba Dee) and finally Sandstorm all play in a row. In addition to that, you can make you game even harder with punishment from the community like 'More AI Traffic' which ramps ups your frustration towards other drivers and your sympathy for truckers everywere.The fun really begins when you realise that you can turn off the speed limiter that is turned on by default and add 30+ mph to your travels. While it sounds like nothing, it doesn't feel that way when you make a poor overtake down a narrow mountain road with a blind bend and run your truck head on into an innocent oncoming vehicle.  Then you realise that 30k in repairs will bankrupt you so it's either that and make a perfect 30 minute delivery with no fines and 'dings' to pay off your mounting debts  or attempt to make deliveries with a truck that randomly has engine failures whilst bombing down the motoway at 80mph.10/10, would scream at poor AI drivers at 3am and wake the house up again.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a great game, and I have no complaints. Driving is fun and easy enough, even with a keyboard and mouse, and is as realistic as you make it with multiple levels of complexity, ranging from options suited to a more casual gamer to life-like controls for more serious simulation gamers.The landscapes you are driving in are beautiful. Their is traffic, weather, and everything you would expect to experience on the road. If my memory serves me correctly, there are also numerous options to control the frequency of rain and things of that nature.There are numerous upgrades you can obtain for your driver to haul better cargo and make more money, as well as numerous trucks you can buy. You're also able to hire staff, but I have yet to progress that far into the game.This game is definitely something to try if you have any interest in simulation games. When I was first recommended it I was leery at first, but after playing the game I can safely say it was more than worth it.			"

												To keep this review short, here is a brief list of pro's and con's.Pro's:-Great looking vehicle models-Road sense plays a big part in this game-A massive, fully explorable map (and every single road, city or bridge have accurate signs)-Limitless combianations of truck parts and paint jobs which are all under your control-Smooth, easy interface, if you are new to simulators its easy to get started in this game-Multiplayer mod. Need I say more?Con's:-The map is massive, but while driving through England or france there are'nt any landmarks. This isnt too bad if you just enjoy the core gameplay (driving) but it can make it a little repetitive-Levelling up can take a while "

												I was challenged to see who was the better driver at this game. Named my driver Tiger Solomon and gave him a jewfro, won the challenge but kept playing because I truly enjoy playing this game. It's relaxing (except for when the occasional driver somehow doesn't notice you indicating). It has everything an aspiring truck driver could want: a radio that plays nothing but country music from the 90's, drivers who just don't seem to notice that there is a bigass truck right in front of them and ram into you, costing YOU money, and the ability to start your own company and pay other people minimum wage to earn you money for doing nothing. 10/10 would flip my truck over again (it was only the one time).

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game dedicated to experiencing the world of trucking from a first person perspective (although, it can be toggled to third person views). You are a trucker in Europe starting out on the job market, being employed by several different companies to complete jobs. As you gain money, you have enough to buy your own truck and complete jobs on the freight market, which pays out a considerable amount more than standard jobs. This then allows you to build up a company, hiring other truckers and buying garages in several different countries, completely switching roles from where you started at the beginning of the game.Overall I'd give it a 9/10, losing the 1 because I'm currently in debt and no matter how much I try to avoid it, some horrible driver always seems to manage to crash into my cargo.

												Do not be put off by other simulator games. This is far different. Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the ultimate driving simulator, offering the player a vast array of destinations across much of Europe.Unfortunately Spain and Portugal have been removed in this iteration of the franchise along with all of western France(There are cities there too, why are they excluded?). The developers luckily have added more destinations to compensate, most notably the inclusion of the island of Britain, but no Ireland sadly. Many new cities have been added to the map curing the barren look of ETS 1. No longer are you limited to 2 or 3 cities per country, now a myriad of cities appear dotted around Europe. The game works best with a steering wheel and pedals, but this is true for just about all driving games. However it is possible to derive a great deal of joy even with a keyboard and mouse. Alternatively it is possible to connect a gamepad such as an Xbox 360 controller. This will enhance your experience greatly, without having to break the bank on a wheel.The graphics are outstanding and don't require a particularly high end system to run at max settings, so long as it does not rain in game as this will cause frames to drop more frequently. The game is well optimised and so you can expect not to have to deal with many problems at all if you have a  somewhat modern computer. Overall this game is an exemplary simulator that shows us and developers what simulators can and should be. Simulators in recent years have been poor, half-finished, untested and quite honestly despicable games. Euro Truck Simulator 2 breaks this trend and thus is exalted into the highest echelon of simulation video games. "

												You should get this game if you :- love trucking games- love developers that put a lot of effort and listen to the community- expect hundreeds of hours of gameplay content before getting bored (which happens only if you are not driven by driving but rather progress)- expect a lot of mods from dev community - want a good bang for your bucks, this game offers so much more content for what it asks in term of price.Issues that bother me personally but should not affect purchasing in general (as in, once you put 200 hours they become annoying but you wont notice them before that mark ) :- You will actually need really good GPU if you want to get this to work on 60 FPS at maxed out settings and look nice- Optimizations are not that great- Extremely annoying AA issues, rendering in the distance without good scaling just looks awful and kills the joy - Really annoying interface prevents fast usage of basic tasks, such as switching trucks, traveling to garages, switching drivers etc.- Companies have no use except to annoy you and let you teleport, plus once you get few of them that work good, you lose all the will to progress, because you will have so much money that you do nothing with ... - If you have a really old save, quick saving takes minutes ... Anyway, if you do get bored in single player, you can always use Multiplayer mod which is fast with updates to ensure that you will play with your friends on latest patch ASAP.Multiplayer is really fun but AI is incredibly good, so if you want to play alone go for it.There are really amazing areas and so so much features.ETS 2 is really worth the money, the content, the mechanics, all the trucks ... just amazing.So while this game has some annoying quirks, it's actually amazing and all the good that it is makes the bad look silly.That's why I nominated ETS 2 for Steam Autumn Reward ""Test of Time"". As it appears, there is no end of this trucking ""adventure"" in sight, and especially now that ATS got released and both games get semi-equal updates.We're in for a long ride my friends, join us and keep trucking.

												There's actually not a lot to say about this game. Mainly because it's not really that eventful. You start off with the map of Europe and the UK. Then, through DLC's, you get to venture into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, which previously where off-limits. Those maps are actually quite immersive, well as much as they can be. You see, as far as the graphics and immersion go, it's pretty standard. There's a lot of detail when it comes down to it, such as all the enviromental objects like trees, walls, NPC's and so on, but every town features the same basic structure, with only slight differences in the layout. Cities aren't actually cities, more towns at best. They all feature 2-5 blocks max. The only distinguishing features that resemble and reflect the towns they're impersonating is the low-quality landmarks associated with the town that can be seen in the distant skies, beyond the city limits. The business side of it does add some fun, a sense of responsibility and management. You get to hire & fire drivers, set up garages and expand your business over every town in Europe.The Multiplayer can be fun, if a little aggressive and even annoying at times. IT's an unofficial add-on I think, and it's servers are usually over-crowded with terrible drivers from all-over the world who are usually too young to know about Highway Codes or any other driving rules, inevitably getting into collisions usually due to their own impatience. Not to worry though! When wars break out, there are admins (most of which are also kids) who police the servers, quite effectively too. Multiplayer is a bit of a rollercoaster, which can be fun in it-self. The roads are empty from NPC's and you will only occasionally encounter another player when not in the Netherlands, where most of them dwell (particularly Rotterdam & Europoort).7/10 would recommend.

												I have been having quite a lot of fun playing this game, even though I admit, there isn't much going on.  I guess that's why it has ""Relaxing"" as a tag.  You start out by driving trucks, and making deliveries for other companies until you are able to save up enough to purchase your own truck.  You can customize it to your liking, and do upgrades to it by pulling into a garage.  Then you can purchase Garages, and start your own trucking company buying trucks, and hiring employees to drive them.  The one problem with the Company part is there is no degree of difficulty.  Just keep buying garage spaces and trucks, to get a pile of drivers earning you money.  Unless you do something silly like totally maxing out the bank loans, you can keep this up endlessly.  Another problem.  You can mod up your NPC Drivers trucks, but you will never see them on the road.The company does seem to be quite dedicated to building the game up yet, adding new content, and fixing alot of things.  And there is a huge modding community, although I haven't downloaded and used any mods yet, and not sure if I will.  The games UI seems to be quite decent.  Cars will let you in if you have you signal light on, but occasionally they will ignore your wishes, much like real life.  The only problem, occasionally on underpasses, the UI will screw up and cause huge traffic gridlocks, and the only way out seems to be driving in the ditch around the area which can cause collisions (Which you have to pay for), damage to your vehicle and the load, ect. Another nice little option they added.  They have a Radio in the semi's that are set to play local (Euro) radio stations via the internet.  So as you're running your load through Berlin or Paris, you have the option of switching to an actual radio station in the area to make it seem even more authentic.Lastly, I will warn.  This game will be boring to many.  I am use to playing racing games, or am always expecting to see a deer or something jump out in front of me when I am driving at night.  Instead, the game is more about scenery, getting the loads to their destinations within the time limit, ensuring you don't run out of gas, crash, roll your heavy load by taking a corner a bit to fast, watching the speed limit (yep the police in game do have photo radar everywhere) as well as red light cameras and they even give fines if you don't have your headlights on as the game starts going into dusk.   The game is made in such a way that you can actually tell what type of load you are carrying by how your semi reacts on the road.  You can actually feel it straining to pull many of the heavy loads, especially when you are starting off, and have semi's with engines that have lower HP.			"

												It's good, but a bit slow. So, in this game you're a truck. Possibly a driver, but you never see a human body, so I'm going with truck. You drive to places and earn money to upgrade yourself. It's very relaxing, but honestly, once you've driven across europe once you've seen it all; there's not enough variation in the environments, and other than the cities, any place you drive across could be in any country. On the other hand, earning money and upgrading your truck is fairly addictive, and there's a dedicated (unofficial) internet radio station you can listen to for the best truckin' tunes.The AI likes driving into you and it's always your fault, just like in real life. Sometimes there's speed cameras, and this is a pain especially in England where your GPS can't (for some reason) show your speed in km/h, making it pretty tough to estimate if you're going at the right speed. Small flaws, but they get annoying.Still, it's not a bad game at all. I guess it boils down to how much you like trucking. It's probably the best truck simulator out there, even with the shortcomings.			"

												""Oh god, a Truck Simulator?"" I hear you think to yourself? Yeah I know. I thought the same thing. It sounds super lame. You're looking at it all wrong though, and what you have to do is look at this as not just a truck simulator and look at it as a trucker lifestyle simulator. If you want to enjoy this, then you're going to have to put in some effort. Go put on a flannel shirt and a trucker cap, and perhaps if you're male, grow out a bit of stubble. Once you're ready, and only when you're ready, you can jump in and start trucking.I don't know how to drive, so knowing the rules of the road is a bit sketchy for me, but after driving a truck I got to know the rules. After a few hours, I was doing long hauls while singing along to taylor swift, pulling over for bathroom breaks dealing with eye fatigue from looking at the same old roads for hours on end and only breaking the law and paying fines every mile or two.Thanks to this truck sim, I feel like I could hop into a truck right now and everything would generally be okay, more or less, and I now consider myself a trucker. 10/10.

												The job was risky (transporting fireworks) but the payment was high. Reached the destination a bit late because I had to repair my truck.I was driving through one of the countryside roads of manchester. It was already late in the evening. I could clearly see the sun setting in the horizon from my left rear view mirror & the sky was red. It would be dark soon. In the radio they were playing ""can you feel the love tonight"" by elton john.Suddenly I heard a cash register sound effect & in my gps it said ""fine €400 for crashing into a vehicle""....had forgot to look into the right mirror....:/Welcome to euro truck simulator! The AI can be a bit wonky at times thus make sure it does not become a fine simulator! Completely recommended if you love travelling.			"

												It's difficult to explain what I like so much about this game. It's relaxing in its own way.The map area is large and even larger and more detailed with the DLCs, especially the Scandinavia and France ones. It's nice to see how the detail of the map has increased with the later DLCs as SCS has been able to grow their team. I just hope they will continue to revisit older parts of the map and spruce them up as the transition from old parts of the map to new ones is very noticable.The multiplayer mod adds another dimension to this game and is what I spend most of my in-game time in. If you can get past the terrible drivers and kids, it's a unique experience. The community that surrounds the game and its multiplayer mod is charming, with community run radio stations, convoys and virtual trucking companies.All in all, it's a good time killer - and after all, isn't that what games should be?

It's not a racing sim though and it's not sandbox style, Feel free to check out my screenshots of it.You get to drive really long distances, there's rain too, and you can stream live radio stations.The only downside is that a lot of places and signs look the same; but there's a lot of places to go to and a lot of different trucks. Also a lot of accidents with cars aren't my fault. The AI is pretty stupid. Also the speed cameras are incredibly unforgiving.I currently have a fleet of 4 trucks and 3 other drivers on my team. They suck at bringing in money so I can repay the loans I took for the trucks from the bank. I don't have a problem yet.			"

 The “Just 5 More Minutes” Award Sometimes I find it hard to sleep at night. One night I decided to open up a broadcast of Euro Truck Sim as my initial opinion was that this game would be boring and upon watching 5 minutes of gameplay I would be sound asleep. I was very wrong. Within a few hours I had befriended the person streaming and was deeply invested in making my own trucking company and taking over the industry. The next day I grabbed my choc milk and waited outside the game store waiting for it to open so I could purchase this game.   Pros - Very soothing and relaxing gameplay- Extensive map spreading across most of Europe - Attention to detail is amazing given the whole surroundings - Traffic programming was surprising well done. They generally comply with road rules. After 80 hours of gameplay I finally caught a car crash - Multiplayer- Extensive mod workshop support. For example I was driving a Pikachu truck in Iceland - Many trucks to choose from - Realtime radio ranging with many different genres to suit your taste - Truck shifting and mechanics overall realistic  Cons - Some of the cities in different countries look identical- No mods in multiplayer hahaNow I can't sleep because I lose track of time whilst actually playing this game 10/10  "

Need I say more?Con's:-The map is massive, but while driving through England or france there are'nt any landmarks. This isnt too bad if you just enjoy the core gameplay (driving) but it can make it a little repetitive-Levelling up can take a while "

												I was challenged to see who was the better driver at this game. Named my driver Tiger Solomon and gave him a jewfro, won the challenge but kept playing because I truly enjoy playing this game. It's relaxing (except for when the occasional driver somehow doesn't notice you indicating). It has everything an aspiring truck driver could want: a radio that plays nothing but country music from the 90's, drivers who just don't seem to notice that there is a bigass truck right in front of them and ram into you, costing YOU money, and the ability to start your own company and pay other people minimum wage to earn you money for doing nothing. 10/10 would flip my truck over again (it was only the one time).

												I don't know why I enjoy this, but I do. By rights it should be laughably bad, but for some reason it just works. The controls are good, the graphics aren't bad, and I've enjoyed it enough to buy the expansion.I find myself playing it most often when I know I only have around 30 minutes or so. It lends itself well to a quick blast, rather than having to spend half an afternoon to get anything out of it.			"

YOU CAN EVEN BUY DLC TO HAVE A SNOWMAN ON YOUR TRUCK.A GOD. DAMN. SNOWMAN. WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULDN'T YOU BUY IT?This game is so ♥♥♥♥ing legit, I had to make a new steam account and buy it again.I cancelled my wedding, put my kids up for adoption, quit my job, and bought a trucker hat so i could play this game for the rest of my life.IF you think this game is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke, YOU'RE NOT PREPARED FOR THE DICKSLAPPIN', GUT TINGLIN', HAIR RAISIN FUN THAT IS THIS GAME.Final review:8.5/10. It's alright i guess. "

												People often now-a-days think: ""What could be the Greatest Simulator of all time? Could it be TRAINZ 12? Or TS2014? Or possibly even Farming Simulator"", to my opinion none of them can withstand the amazing graphics SCS Software has put into EURO TRUCK SIMULATOR 2, it is realistic enough to make you feel like you are actually driving a truck and Logitech Joysticks boosts that experience of opportunity. Take a look back to SCS Software's previous games, for instance, BUS DRIVER GOLD 1.5, I've played that for a while and I never seemed to fit into it, either because of the blinkers... or because of the intensity of breaking... but this time they've put an improved version of that but with trucks! Another recent improvement would be the 1.9 BETA, if you seen the recent videos of them you would see a MASSIVE improvement such as the AI traffic, the AI Wheel actually turning and even when the AI slows down when you turn on a blinker, I find all these kinds of improvements very exquisite and amazing. I am quite looking forward to seeing an MMP (Massivly Multiplayer) Beta and to see if that can be even better! This has pretty much been a better truck simulator than the ones like ETS1 or UKTS.			"

												Now i just edit this review for my official review.I personally like this game is awsome as although this game is not fast paced like the recent tripple games that came out like BF1 or older titles like GTA 5 but damn this game stood the test of time. It came out three years ago like GTA 5 and like GTA 5 the online is still booming. Well yes the online for this game is esentially a mod but hey Just Cause 2's Online is also a mod. Every time i go back in is game, I do a Long- Haul delivery i feel like doing it again even though it is literally 3 hours long.""Downsides"" I hear you ask. Errm i cannot really think of any because all the downsides were rectified during its development course. Wait i can think of one. The only fact that ETS2 is running on DIrect X9. But it is not really a downside because SCS software thought of the Mac users of which because of Apple idiocy of not upgrading their software SCS is forced to use Direct X9 just so Mac users are able to run the game. I hear you in the background picking up that pichfork. Put it down yes i said you. Do not start a riot because SCS wants to keep their Mac users. Because they do not want the Mac users to miss out on this superb game they made.So to sum it all up this game is lovely and this game is highly addictive just ask my friend ,Hannah, she doubted the game at first but when she picked it up she went from level zero to level 25 in no time and i cannot do anything to dissuade her from playing it anymore.Oh to add there was only two games that won two steam award. One of which is..... Euro Truck Simulator ,the other one is Grand Thief Auto 5. Just think for a while GTA 5 had a budget rivaling of a big budget hollywood blockbuster while Euro Truck Simulator was made by a small software developer in Scandivia. That shows you the scale of this game.P.S For any one who just join the sim community i would highly reccomend this game for you.P.S.S Even if you are not interested in trucks you should really pick it up because there is something soothing about dragging a 24 ton trailer with a 730 horsepower truck across europe.

												One of my favourite games to play to have time pass by. Game feels dull and boring if you play on the lowest settings, so to enjoy the game to its best you should play at medium or above. Controls feel nice whether it's keyboard and mouse, or a gaming wheel. The game has a lot of content that can last for over a hundred hours, plus DLC. To enjoy the game to its fullest, I suggest to buy a gaming wheel.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the best games ever made. I honestly belive that this is one of the few titles that meets all of the requirements for being almost perfect. It may lack action, and violence, and role-playing, but it still has something for everyone. Most people see it and think it's a kids game that is very bad, and boring. I sure thought this at first. But under the misleading cover, is a truly briliant book, if you get my medafore. You won't understand until you play, but there is something about this game that makes it just brilliant.The vanilla (base) game includes a large chunk of Europe, a reasonable amount of content, an okay (usually) AI system, and an extremely immersive graphics/physics engine. Along with these things are a variety of gameplay options ranging from sleeping at rest stops to simulated air systems. Now comes the bad things. The AI is the biggest bring-down. The devs have been hard at work trying to make the AI perfect, but it is still AI. They will hit you, they will troll you, they will trick you. But other than that, there is not much to complain about. Here is a list of pros/cons:Pros:. Amazing graphics. Extremely high frame-rate. Good physics. A capable AI system. Clean UI. Immersion. Good gameplay. Completely unguided playthrough-short tutorial and you can do what ever you want. Huge landscapes. Much affordable DLC, adding a lot more content. An entire online community made by the developers (World Of Trucks). Amazing modding communityCons:. Thin objects (power lines, guard rails, etc) tend to have a shimmering affect at distances. AI could be better. Not much fast-paced gameplay, can be boring for some. One or two truck models are outdated, and need overhauls. Not a huge selection of trailers/cargoes to useOverall, I would highly reccomend this game.If you dissagree with anything I said, or think that I could improve upon my reviewing skills in any way, feel free to leave a comment to help with future reviews.

												Was hauling yogourt one rainy night, until I fell asleep while listening to the raindrops on my windshield. I wake up to a yogourt covered, upside down truck on the wrong side of the road with cars beeping at me. Turns out when I was asleep, I ran into a car, hit the railing in the middle of the highway, my truck did a barrel roll over it landing on top of a car and forced all my yogourt out of the truck. 11/10. Would haul yogourt again while sleeping.(P.S. Yogourt doesn't actually fly out of your truck, and yes, I actually fell asleep while playing this game at 5 A.M.)			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game dedicated to experiencing the world of trucking from a first person perspective (although, it can be toggled to third person views). You are a trucker in Europe starting out on the job market, being employed by several different companies to complete jobs. As you gain money, you have enough to buy your own truck and complete jobs on the freight market, which pays out a considerable amount more than standard jobs. This then allows you to build up a company, hiring other truckers and buying garages in several different countries, completely switching roles from where you started at the beginning of the game.Overall I'd give it a 9/10, losing the 1 because I'm currently in debt and no matter how much I try to avoid it, some horrible driver always seems to manage to crash into my cargo.

												I've got to say it. This is a great game. It's a game to buy whether you're a racing type person or, like me, just someone who needs a reason for a relaxing drive in several countries. The realism's pretty good, although there are a couple of negative quirks; one being that one or two junctions are incorrectly labelled in advance so you only find out at the last second that you need to move to another lane; the other being a tendency for slip road AI traffic to assume right of way over people on the main road. But these quirks are things you'll get used to in no time and you'll have hours of fun delivering the heaviest and most dangerous loads all over Europe.One piece of advice though. Don't pick up any AI Hikers. You never know what they might get up to. :p			"

												Inside all of us, there's an unsatiable, yet unnoticed desire inside all human beings to drive giant trucks carrying heavy cargo. However, many are scared to go out into the real world to satisfy this need, as doing so would put their lives, others' lives, and the cargo carried in danger. But where can you expirement with a playground that is wide open, realistic, AND simulated? This game has and is the answer to that question.Welcome to Euro Truck Simulator 2.Now, when I first viewed this game, I was VERY skeptical to say the least. Then I saw the demo, thought why not, only 1000 megabytes. And boy was I hooked. It was a great ride (haha) with the demo while it lasted, but it only lasted for five shipments.Then I got to contemplating. Is the price of this game worth it? As of now, yes! I am loving the game. It may not be for the hardcore Call of Duty players, but it sure can suit a wide range of other gamers.TL;DR: Fun game, great price, definately worth it.+Great graphics! The great textures help add to the feel of the game.+Great little-things-that-most-people-don't-pay-attention-to; You actually have to press keys for turn signals, windshield wipers, etc.+There are rules of the road! If you crush other cars you get fined, you also get fined for exessively going over the speed limit and running red lights!-Sadly, you cannot exit your vehicle. I feel that if this was in the game it would make it to the top of my list. I'd love to park off duty, go and customize the clothing my character has, and be able to walk around my vehicle.8/10, definately does it's job; it's simulating trucking! In Europe!			"

												The last review I posted for this game was kinda cringy, and was posted when I only had like 5 Hours in this game, so I'm here to write a new one. This is my favorite game on Steam at the moment, and nothing comes close to it except for American Truck Simulator. This game is HOURS of fun. You get to travel all over Europe as King Of The Road, a European trucker who sets out to conquer the continent one delivery at a time. The graphics in this game are SO close to real life, that it's almost impossible to believe it's not real. Not to mention, this game has Endless DLCs for cheap prices, AMAZING Paint Jobs for the trucks, and very unique concepts. Not to mention, I can listen to Metallica and True Scary Stories From YouTube Narrators while trucking. The achievements are grindy and take blood, sweat, and tears to earn as well, and there's nothing I like more than a game that takes effort to get 100% Achievements in. To wrap up this review, SCS Software is an AMAZING Dev team, and there's no scenario in any dimension where I'd give this game a negative review. Thanks for many hours of fun SCS, and here's to many hours more! ;D			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the best games ever made. I honestly belive that this is one of the few titles that meets all of the requirements for being almost perfect. It may lack action, and violence, and role-playing, but it still has something for everyone. Most people see it and think it's a kids game that is very bad, and boring. I sure thought this at first. But under the misleading cover, is a truly briliant book, if you get my medafore. You won't understand until you play, but there is something about this game that makes it just brilliant.The vanilla (base) game includes a large chunk of Europe, a reasonable amount of content, an okay (usually) AI system, and an extremely immersive graphics/physics engine. Along with these things are a variety of gameplay options ranging from sleeping at rest stops to simulated air systems. Now comes the bad things. The AI is the biggest bring-down. The devs have been hard at work trying to make the AI perfect, but it is still AI. They will hit you, they will troll you, they will trick you. But other than that, there is not much to complain about. Here is a list of pros/cons:Pros:. Amazing graphics. Extremely high frame-rate. Good physics. A capable AI system. Clean UI. Immersion. Good gameplay. Completely unguided playthrough-short tutorial and you can do what ever you want. Huge landscapes. Much affordable DLC, adding a lot more content.

												Inside all of us, there's an unsatiable, yet unnoticed desire inside all human beings to drive giant trucks carrying heavy cargo. However, many are scared to go out into the real world to satisfy this need, as doing so would put their lives, others' lives, and the cargo carried in danger. But where can you expirement with a playground that is wide open, realistic, AND simulated? This game has and is the answer to that question.Welcome to Euro Truck Simulator 2.Now, when I first viewed this game, I was VERY skeptical to say the least. Then I saw the demo, thought why not, only 1000 megabytes. And boy was I hooked. It was a great ride (haha) with the demo while it lasted, but it only lasted for five shipments.Then I got to contemplating. Is the price of this game worth it? As of now, yes! I am loving the game. It may not be for the hardcore Call of Duty players, but it sure can suit a wide range of other gamers.TL;DR: Fun game, great price, definately worth it.+Great graphics! The great textures help add to the feel of the game.+Great little-things-that-most-people-don't-pay-attention-to; You actually have to press keys for turn signals, windshield wipers, etc.+There are rules of the road! If you crush other cars you get fined, you also get fined for exessively going over the speed limit and running red lights!-Sadly, you cannot exit your vehicle. I feel that if this was in the game it would make it to the top of my list. I'd love to park off duty, go and customize the clothing my character has, and be able to walk around my vehicle.8/10, definately does it's job; it's simulating trucking! In Europe!			"

												I started my career as a Formula One driver. Then I have gone for Rally, like Kimi the Iceman. Now I am a truck driver with a €100,000 bank loan. In a strange way, I am loving my new job.* My first job was to deliver apples from Cambridge to Birmingham. Not quite recalling how UK road system works (left UK since 95, true story), I have ended up with a huge detour.* I have learned that making a U-turn with a loaded truck is actually an art.* Finding a place for a U-turn is even more challenging!* I have turned into a small road thinking that I could find my way back to Birmingham. My truck nearly got stuck!* Crashed a few cars along the way. Went through speed camera twice. They took my money, not my license. Phew.* Dented the truck due to my obvious lack of experience. Luckily, that ain't my truck.* I hate working for people. After 2 jobs, I have decided to take up a €100,000 bank loan. The banker was nice. No question asked.* I randomly picked some jobs. Oops. Why didn't I pick a job that starts where I am?!* Drove through the sunset to pick up my first job as a proud owner of my truck.* Continue through the night to deliver my first job - logs.* My body outside the game is alert but my body inside the game was tired. I am seeing my computer screen blacking out.* Fortunately I found a motel nearby. I don't think they have charged me a penny. I love UK.Now, my body (outside the game) is tired. But I really want to deliver another job for some virtual currency to pay back my virtual loan. I may lose my real life job if I continue this way. Don't buy this game. It will destroy your life.

												The last review I posted for this game was kinda cringy, and was posted when I only had like 5 Hours in this game, so I'm here to write a new one. This is my favorite game on Steam at the moment, and nothing comes close to it except for American Truck Simulator. This game is HOURS of fun. You get to travel all over Europe as King Of The Road, a European trucker who sets out to conquer the continent one delivery at a time. The graphics in this game are SO close to real life, that it's almost impossible to believe it's not real. Not to mention, this game has Endless DLCs for cheap prices, AMAZING Paint Jobs for the trucks, and very unique concepts. Not to mention, I can listen to Metallica and True Scary Stories From YouTube Narrators while trucking. The achievements are grindy and take blood, sweat, and tears to earn as well, and there's nothing I like more than a game that takes effort to get 100% Achievements in. To wrap up this review, SCS Software is an AMAZING Dev team, and there's no scenario in any dimension where I'd give this game a negative review. Thanks for many hours of fun SCS, and here's to many hours more! ;D			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is one of the best games ever made. I honestly belive that this is one of the few titles that meets all of the requirements for being almost perfect. It may lack action, and violence, and role-playing, but it still has something for everyone. Most people see it and think it's a kids game that is very bad, and boring. I sure thought this at first. But under the misleading cover, is a truly briliant book, if you get my medafore. You won't understand until you play, but there is something about this game that makes it just brilliant.The vanilla (base) game includes a large chunk of Europe, a reasonable amount of content, an okay (usually) AI system, and an extremely immersive graphics/physics engine. Along with these things are a variety of gameplay options ranging from sleeping at rest stops to simulated air systems. Now comes the bad things. The AI is the biggest bring-down. The devs have been hard at work trying to make the AI perfect, but it is still AI. They will hit you, they will troll you, they will trick you. But other than that, there is not much to complain about. Here is a list of pros/cons:Pros:. Amazing graphics. Extremely high frame-rate. Good physics. A capable AI system. Clean UI. Immersion. Good gameplay. Completely unguided playthrough-short tutorial and you can do what ever you want. Huge landscapes. Much affordable DLC, adding a lot more content. An entire online community made by the developers (World Of Trucks). Amazing modding communityCons:. Thin objects (power lines, guard rails, etc) tend to have a shimmering affect at distances. AI could be better. Not much fast-paced gameplay, can be boring for some. One or two truck models are outdated, and need overhauls. Not a huge selection of trailers/cargoes to useOverall, I would highly reccomend this game.If you dissagree with anything I said, or think that I could improve upon my reviewing skills in any way, feel free to leave a comment to help with future reviews.

												Great game for every truck fan. Totally worth the money.You control a logistic company beginning with borrowed truck for each single job until you earn enough money to buy your own truck. Earning even more allow you to buy another truck and hire a foreign driver who will work for your company, earning even more money. Then you can just driving around and your workers will bring your company profit.Big map, good graphic, full wheel support even with clutch pedal and a shifter. You may control sight with additional hardware like TrackIR if mouse is not comfortable for you. Good driving physics in terms of PC games. You can drive on keyboard comfortably with automatic or manual/sequential transmission or you can make it more enjoyable with wheel and shifter shifting all 12 gears completely manually like in a real car. Releasing clutch pedal also would make your engine stall.			"

												There's actually not a lot to say about this game. Mainly because it's not really that eventful. You start off with the map of Europe and the UK. Then, through DLC's, you get to venture into Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, which previously where off-limits. Those maps are actually quite immersive, well as much as they can be. You see, as far as the graphics and immersion go, it's pretty standard. There's a lot of detail when it comes down to it, such as all the enviromental objects like trees, walls, NPC's and so on, but every town features the same basic structure, with only slight differences in the layout. Cities aren't actually cities, more towns at best. They all feature 2-5 blocks max. The only distinguishing features that resemble and reflect the towns they're impersonating is the low-quality landmarks associated with the town that can be seen in the distant skies, beyond the city limits. The business side of it does add some fun, a sense of responsibility and management. You get to hire & fire drivers, set up garages and expand your business over every town in Europe.The Multiplayer can be fun, if a little aggressive and even annoying at times. IT's an unofficial add-on I think, and it's servers are usually over-crowded with terrible drivers from all-over the world who are usually too young to know about Highway Codes or any other driving rules, inevitably getting into collisions usually due to their own impatience. Not to worry though! When wars break out, there are admins (most of which are also kids) who police the servers, quite effectively too. Multiplayer is a bit of a rollercoaster, which can be fun in it-self. The roads are empty from NPC's and you will only occasionally encounter another player when not in the Netherlands, where most of them dwell (particularly Rotterdam & Europoort).7/10 would recommend.

												As you can tell from the name, it's a simulator. Let's just start this review off by saying, simulators are not for everyone. In Euro Truck Simulator 2 you take the wheel of a tractor trailer across Europe. You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.Pros:-Great Time Passer-Good Graphics-Very Realistic-You Drive All Across Europe-Learn How to Manage Your Own CompanyCons:-There is none, buy this game.Final Verdict:10/10			"

												I have been playing this game  for over 300 hours and clocked up over 100,000Kms.It is a very life like driving simulation and quite relaxing. Some people may scoff at just a truck simulation but until you try it you don't know whayt you are missing out on, The truck details are spot on and the scenery is very realistic. The ongoing updates just add more features and realism each time they arrive. I highly recommend getting a steering wheel and pedals to makit esaier and more realistic I plan on getting American Truck Simulator as it appears to be as good if not better than ETS2  in it's own rights, the teaser videos make it look really good. This game is a good as it gets, if you like driving a car or larger vehicle you will love it. No screaming around doing wheelies or driftng just plain old driving sensibly. 5 Star Rating * * * * *			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that you will either love or hate. Personally, I love it. I first started playing SCS's trucking games with the 18 Wheels of Steel series. A friend gave me a copy of American Longhaul and it got tossed on the shelf as I thought I would have no interest in it. A few months later I decided to install it and after half an hour of play I was hooked. I then went on to put many hours into all the games in the series.I received ETS 1 in a bundle one day and set it aside to play at a later date, but I never got around to it. Then one day a friend of mine told me he had bought ETS 2 after playing my copy of ETS 1 through my shared library. He was one guy that I thought would not enjoy a truck driving simulator (in fact he originally ribbed me about playing 18WOS), so I was surprised when he started raving about it. That was enough for me to buy the game and all the DLC.Once again, I am hooked on a trucking simulator and it is great. ETS 2 is leaps and bounds above all of the previous efforts by SCS, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. There is still the problem of braindead AI drivers, but that is something you will learn to anticipate and it does not become such a problem after a while. The visuals are stunning, you just have to look at some of the screenshots to see how pretty this game is, and the truck models are fantastic. All of the trucks feel different when you drive them and you will soon find your favourites and those that you loathe to drive.With the addition of mods, especially some of the map mods available, the replay value of the game increases. There is even a multiplayer mod that regularly sees thousands of people on some of the servers. It is quite a sight to see hundreds of people lined up trying to get into Europort.The game is also linked to the  World of Trucks[www.worldoftrucks.com] website which offers external contracts, events, and more. The site is only alpha at the moment, but with the imminent release of American Truck Simulator I can see more features being revealed.As I said this is not a game for everyone, but if you like simulators and you like trucks then you will probably like this. As for whether to purchase or hold of for ATS, I would recommend buying this and then also ATS when it is released.5/5			"

												I wanted something completely different after playing lots of rpgs, this seemed to fit the bill.I've read other reviews claiming this game is ""relaxing"". I won't go that far because you have to pay a lot of attention while driving, it is, however, a straight forward driving sim, no racing, no one shooting at you, no airstrikes from alien motherships, just you, your truck, and the road. Well there are the occasional kamikaze drivers on the highways that stop for no reason when traffic is going 90 kph. ;) The game has two parts, the actually driving part and the business part. You start the game with nothing but the skill to drive and have to take jobs from other companies to build up your cash. You can also get loans from the bank if you want/need them. Once you get your own truck your then free to look into the frieght market and get jobs there using your vehicle. Once you have enough money either from saving it or borrowing from the bank you can start to buy trucks, upgrades for trucks (engines/lights/paintjobs/etc) and garages. You can also hire other truckers from recruitment agencies scattered around Europe. You can upgrade your garages also, from simple metal shacks to shiny ultra modern vehicle hubs. At your garage you get a bunch of controls over your employees from hiring to firing. Oh! Almost forgot, you must supply your employees with the truck, they don't bring there own rides. As for the graphics, I'd say its up there with just about any of the car race games around today, the day/night and weather cycle is dynamic and visually nice to observe. The cars and trucks, the roads you drive, the signs, lights and countryside are all crisp and detailed. Sound is pretty good, if nothing exceptional, you hear rain and thunder during a storm, your own truck sounds just like a semi, even the sound of planes near airports and trains at crossings, all in motion. The only motionless background I found a bit cheesy was the frozen breakers coming off the water when your by say the English Channel.Game play isn't hard at all if you want it that way, you can use k+m with WASD if you like, or a game controller, or even all the way up to total sim level steering wheel and shifters (I've seen some guys kit this out to a @.@ extent on Youtube). Backing up the truck with a trailer on it is /hard/ but thats not the fault of the sim, its just a hard thing to do well. If you don't wan't to do that, however, the game lets you just hit enter at your destination and your automagically parked. I've found this game oddly compelling, its not relaxing in the sense a Myst style game would be with just pretty things to look at, but its emotionally neutral, no worry about killing or saving the hostage or whatever, just get the load to its destination and save for that Volvo FH16 you wanted. In this sense it really /is/ a simulation, both of driving and managing a small business. It makes you feel the freedom of the road and the sense of competence and satisfaction when you get the job done. If your looking for Mike Bay style 'splosions, you will hate this thing.If you like train sims you'll LOVE this thing.Great game, can't say I'm not loving it.(My system specs: Intel Quad i7 4790K, Nvidia GTX 770, 8 gigs mem)			"

												#21 hours in# I own 3 trucks / 3 garages# Driver level 13An admittably weirdly cathartic game that is a tycoon game disguised as a driving game. Start with nothing, perform jobs to get more money. Buy a rig (as opposed to using others' rigs), make more money. Level up (RPG elements!). Gain the ability to transport more fragile and hazardous goods. Be able to take on longer routes. Buy another rig. Hire a driver. Build an empire. It looks like it would be boring. It seems like it should be boring. But it for some unexplainable reason is entertaining. Also there are a metric ton of mods for custom paint jobs, custom weather, totally new maps, new trailers, etc. If you like tycoon games and dont mind doing the actual work of the tycoon (driving) than this game may be for you. It is the perfect game to put the in-game internet radio or selectable music folder to and just chill out and not realize it is 2am and you need to go to bed.Regarding distance:The routes are (obviously) shorter than real life. It seems - In my experience - that 1 hour drive time (going the average speed limit of 45-55 or so) takes about 3 real world minutes.MODS:http://ets2mods.org/Support for mods is in game (although not steam workshop).

												TL;DR: Buy it, you won't regret it.Nothing can compare to Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's not somehting specific but a concoction of many different things that peice this game together into a beautiful mix of stress and relaxation.The joy of roaming the world at the start, working for others in their trucks is blissful. Being able to ding the truck untill it is 100% damaged with no consequences makes the later parts of the game have so much more gravity and realism. At the moment of taking a loan out from the bank and buying your own truck is the moment it all becomes real. When 1% damage costs as much as £1000 of your own money is the moment you get serious about being a professional truck driver and not a suicidal maniac on the roads of Europe.But all that pressure washes away as you are making your delivery bound from London to Luxemburg when listening to the volunteer run radio stadion does Barbie Girl, The Crazy Frog, Blue (Da Ba Dee) and finally Sandstorm all play in a row. In addition to that, you can make you game even harder with punishment from the community like 'More AI Traffic' which ramps ups your frustration towards other drivers and your sympathy for truckers everywere.The fun really begins when you realise that you can turn off the speed limiter that is turned on by default and add 30+ mph to your travels. While it sounds like nothing, it doesn't feel that way when you make a poor overtake down a narrow mountain road with a blind bend and run your truck head on into an innocent oncoming vehicle.  Then you realise that 30k in repairs will bankrupt you so it's either that and make a perfect 30 minute delivery with no fines and 'dings' to pay off your mounting debts  or attempt to make deliveries with a truck that randomly has engine failures whilst bombing down the motoway at 80mph.10/10, would scream at poor AI drivers at 3am and wake the house up again.

												This game is awesome especially after the recent updates and dlc releases. I like the fact that you are able to drive nearly anywhere in europe, this is improved if you buy both of the map expansion dlc's.Although this game is very good the one thing it lacks is heavy loads, luckily there is a very good mod community.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a great game, and I have no complaints. Driving is fun and easy enough, even with a keyboard and mouse, and is as realistic as you make it with multiple levels of complexity, ranging from options suited to a more casual gamer to life-like controls for more serious simulation gamers.The landscapes you are driving in are beautiful. Their is traffic, weather, and everything you would expect to experience on the road. If my memory serves me correctly, there are also numerous options to control the frequency of rain and things of that nature.There are numerous upgrades you can obtain for your driver to haul better cargo and make more money, as well as numerous trucks you can buy. You're also able to hire staff, but I have yet to progress that far into the game.This game is definitely something to try if you have any interest in simulation games. When I was first recommended it I was leery at first, but after playing the game I can safely say it was more than worth it.			"

												Awesome game, good to just sit back and relax and just take it in. Control allows 360 pad, keyboard and also supports steering wheels. You can also have the way it plays set to full auto gear change to full on truck sim with manually changing gears etc. Music you can either drop a load of your own MP3's into the relevant folder or just choose an internet radio station to play in the background while driving. I have found REAL & Magic tend to play the best trucking songs as they tend to play stuff from the 80 mixed with a bit of modern stuff.Visually the scenery won't blow you away and you will notice ommissions when driving about your local city, it doesn't matter though, vehicles look amazing and the playability is right up there.It literally has the one more run appeal before turning it off, it is highly addictive and well worth being in any ones collection.

												The job was risky (transporting fireworks) but the payment was high. Reached the destination a bit late because I had to repair my truck.I was driving through one of the countryside roads of manchester. It was already late in the evening. I could clearly see the sun setting in the horizon from my left rear view mirror & the sky was red. It would be dark soon. In the radio they were playing ""can you feel the love tonight"" by elton john.Suddenly I heard a cash register sound effect & in my gps it said ""fine €400 for crashing into a vehicle""....had forgot to look into the right mirror....:/Welcome to euro truck simulator! The AI can be a bit wonky at times thus make sure it does not become a fine simulator! Completely recommended if you love travelling.			"

												Who the heck wants to play a truck simulator? That's what I thought at least when I first saw this game. I didn't even give it a second look. But thanks to fate, I won a copy of American Truck Simulator (ATS) from a giveaway and so was able to try it out. Did I like it? Well, you can check my # of hours played and you'll know.This is where Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) comes in. ATS is all well and good, but at some point, since it's new, the map runs out quite quickly. ETS2 is the complete package. It is the culmination of 3+ years of updates and content not only from SCS Software, but also from elite modders who are continuing to create quality maps, trucks, and other mods that keep the game fresh. I have become a full-on truck fan thanks to these games, so much so that when I go out of the house, watch movies, or do anything in real-life, I never fail to notice the trucks that pass by, including their makes, trailers, setup, and everything else you can think of.If you want a more detailed look, feel free to check out my ETS2 series over at YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj2qHU-FlZQVI6rM2qlTHH8fYrl0eqziGHere's the first episode of the series as a sneak peek, for anyone interested:

												Now i just edit this review for my official review.I personally like this game is awsome as although this game is not fast paced like the recent tripple games that came out like BF1 or older titles like GTA 5 but damn this game stood the test of time. It came out three years ago like GTA 5 and like GTA 5 the online is still booming. Well yes the online for this game is esentially a mod but hey Just Cause 2's Online is also a mod. Every time i go back in is game, I do a Long- Haul delivery i feel like doing it again even though it is literally 3 hours long.""Downsides"" I hear you ask. Errm i cannot really think of any because all the downsides were rectified during its development course. Wait i can think of one. The only fact that ETS2 is running on DIrect X9. But it is not really a downside because SCS software thought of the Mac users of which because of Apple idiocy of not upgrading their software SCS is forced to use Direct X9 just so Mac users are able to run the game. I hear you in the background picking up that pichfork. Put it down yes i said you. Do not start a riot because SCS wants to keep their Mac users. Because they do not want the Mac users to miss out on this superb game they made.So to sum it all up this game is lovely and this game is highly addictive just ask my friend ,Hannah, she doubted the game at first but when she picked it up she went from level zero to level 25 in no time and i cannot do anything to dissuade her from playing it anymore.Oh to add there was only two games that won two steam award. One of which is..... Euro Truck Simulator ,the other one is Grand Thief Auto 5. Just think for a while GTA 5 had a budget rivaling of a big budget hollywood blockbuster while Euro Truck Simulator was made by a small software developer in Scandivia. That shows you the scale of this game.P.S For any one who just join the sim community i would highly reccomend this game for you.P.S.S Even if you are not interested in trucks you should really pick it up because there is something soothing about dragging a 24 ton trailer with a 730 horsepower truck across europe.

												As you can tell from the name, it's a simulator. Let's just start this review off by saying, simulators are not for everyone. In Euro Truck Simulator 2 you take the wheel of a tractor trailer across Europe. You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.Pros:-Great Time Passer-Good Graphics-Very Realistic-You Drive All Across Europe-Learn How to Manage Your Own CompanyCons:-There is none, buy this game.Final Verdict:10/10			"

												I have been playing this game  for over 300 hours and clocked up over 100,000Kms.It is a very life like driving simulation and quite relaxing. Some people may scoff at just a truck simulation but until you try it you don't know whayt you are missing out on, The truck details are spot on and the scenery is very realistic. The ongoing updates just add more features and realism each time they arrive. I highly recommend getting a steering wheel and pedals to makit esaier and more realistic I plan on getting American Truck Simulator as it appears to be as good if not better than ETS2  in it's own rights, the teaser videos make it look really good. This game is a good as it gets, if you like driving a car or larger vehicle you will love it. No screaming around doing wheelies or driftng just plain old driving sensibly. 5 Star Rating * * * * *			"

												I wanted something completely different after playing lots of rpgs, this seemed to fit the bill.I've read other reviews claiming this game is ""relaxing"". I won't go that far because you have to pay a lot of attention while driving, it is, however, a straight forward driving sim, no racing, no one shooting at you, no airstrikes from alien motherships, just you, your truck, and the road. Well there are the occasional kamikaze drivers on the highways that stop for no reason when traffic is going 90 kph. ;) The game has two parts, the actually driving part and the business part. You start the game with nothing but the skill to drive and have to take jobs from other companies to build up your cash. You can also get loans from the bank if you want/need them. Once you get your own truck your then free to look into the frieght market and get jobs there using your vehicle. Once you have enough money either from saving it or borrowing from the bank you can start to buy trucks, upgrades for trucks (engines/lights/paintjobs/etc) and garages. You can also hire other truckers from recruitment agencies scattered around Europe. You can upgrade your garages also, from simple metal shacks to shiny ultra modern vehicle hubs. At your garage you get a bunch of controls over your employees from hiring to firing. Oh! Almost forgot, you must supply your employees with the truck, they don't bring there own rides. As for the graphics, I'd say its up there with just about any of the car race games around today, the day/night and weather cycle is dynamic and visually nice to observe. The cars and trucks, the roads you drive, the signs, lights and countryside are all crisp and detailed. Sound is pretty good, if nothing exceptional, you hear rain and thunder during a storm, your own truck sounds just like a semi, even the sound of planes near airports and trains at crossings, all in motion. The only motionless background I found a bit cheesy was the frozen breakers coming off the water when your by say the English Channel.Game play isn't hard at all if you want it that way, you can use k+m with WASD if you like, or a game controller, or even all the way up to total sim level steering wheel and shifters (I've seen some guys kit this out to a @.@ extent on Youtube). Backing up the truck with a trailer on it is /hard/ but thats not the fault of the sim, its just a hard thing to do well. If you don't wan't to do that, however, the game lets you just hit enter at your destination and your automagically parked. I've found this game oddly compelling, its not relaxing in the sense a Myst style game would be with just pretty things to look at, but its emotionally neutral, no worry about killing or saving the hostage or whatever, just get the load to its destination and save for that Volvo FH16 you wanted. In this sense it really /is/ a simulation, both of driving and managing a small business. It makes you feel the freedom of the road and the sense of competence and satisfaction when you get the job done. If your looking for Mike Bay style 'splosions, you will hate this thing.If you like train sims you'll LOVE this thing.Great game, can't say I'm not loving it.(My system specs: Intel Quad i7 4790K, Nvidia GTX 770, 8 gigs mem)			"

												You should get this game if you :- love trucking games- love developers that put a lot of effort and listen to the community- expect hundreeds of hours of gameplay content before getting bored (which happens only if you are not driven by driving but rather progress)- expect a lot of mods from dev community - want a good bang for your bucks, this game offers so much more content for what it asks in term of price.Issues that bother me personally but should not affect purchasing in general (as in, once you put 200 hours they become annoying but you wont notice them before that mark ) :- You will actually need really good GPU if you want to get this to work on 60 FPS at maxed out settings and look nice- Optimizations are not that great- Extremely annoying AA issues, rendering in the distance without good scaling just looks awful and kills the joy - Really annoying interface prevents fast usage of basic tasks, such as switching trucks, traveling to garages, switching drivers etc.- Companies have no use except to annoy you and let you teleport, plus once you get few of them that work good, you lose all the will to progress, because you will have so much money that you do nothing with ... - If you have a really old save, quick saving takes minutes ... Anyway, if you do get bored in single player, you can always use Multiplayer mod which is fast with updates to ensure that you will play with your friends on latest patch ASAP.Multiplayer is really fun but AI is incredibly good, so if you want to play alone go for it.There are really amazing areas and so so much features.ETS 2 is really worth the money, the content, the mechanics, all the trucks ... just amazing.So while this game has some annoying quirks, it's actually amazing and all the good that it is makes the bad look silly.That's why I nominated ETS 2 for Steam Autumn Reward ""Test of Time"". As it appears, there is no end of this trucking ""adventure"" in sight, and especially now that ATS got released and both games get semi-equal updates.We're in for a long ride my friends, join us and keep trucking.

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that you will either love or hate. Personally, I love it. I first started playing SCS's trucking games with the 18 Wheels of Steel series. A friend gave me a copy of American Longhaul and it got tossed on the shelf as I thought I would have no interest in it. A few months later I decided to install it and after half an hour of play I was hooked. I then went on to put many hours into all the games in the series.I received ETS 1 in a bundle one day and set it aside to play at a later date, but I never got around to it. Then one day a friend of mine told me he had bought ETS 2 after playing my copy of ETS 1 through my shared library. He was one guy that I thought would not enjoy a truck driving simulator (in fact he originally ribbed me about playing 18WOS), so I was surprised when he started raving about it. That was enough for me to buy the game and all the DLC.Once again, I am hooked on a trucking simulator and it is great. ETS 2 is leaps and bounds above all of the previous efforts by SCS, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. There is still the problem of braindead AI drivers, but that is something you will learn to anticipate and it does not become such a problem after a while. The visuals are stunning, you just have to look at some of the screenshots to see how pretty this game is, and the truck models are fantastic. All of the trucks feel different when you drive them and you will soon find your favourites and those that you loathe to drive.With the addition of mods, especially some of the map mods available, the replay value of the game increases. There is even a multiplayer mod that regularly sees thousands of people on some of the servers. It is quite a sight to see hundreds of people lined up trying to get into Europort.The game is also linked to the  World of Trucks[www.worldoftrucks.com] website which offers external contracts, events, and more. The site is only alpha at the moment, but with the imminent release of American Truck Simulator I can see more features being revealed.As I said this is not a game for everyone, but if you like simulators and you like trucks then you will probably like this. As for whether to purchase or hold of for ATS, I would recommend buying this and then also ATS when it is released.5/5			"

												Great game for every truck fan. Totally worth the money.You control a logistic company beginning with borrowed truck for each single job until you earn enough money to buy your own truck. Earning even more allow you to buy another truck and hire a foreign driver who will work for your company, earning even more money. Then you can just driving around and your workers will bring your company profit.Big map, good graphic, full wheel support even with clutch pedal and a shifter. You may control sight with additional hardware like TrackIR if mouse is not comfortable for you. Good driving physics in terms of PC games. You can drive on keyboard comfortably with automatic or manual/sequential transmission or you can make it more enjoyable with wheel and shifter shifting all 12 gears completely manually like in a real car. Releasing clutch pedal also would make your engine stall.			"

												Great Game. A realistic simulation and helps a player to be familiarize with a truck. and to experience on how truck drivers do in real world. A must have game in steam and a great value for the bucks.  "

												Haven't been playing for too long, don't need to, to understand what I've learnt... This game was designed so that you don't have to be a truck driver, to drive a truck.----------------------------------------------------------So come closer and let me tell you a story of true pain.It's daylight, the sun is high in the sky and you can feel the warmth of its rays through the windowshield- but you start to tyre tire of the same old motorway you drive down, with the same old scenery- 2D trees and sunflowers line the grassy banks of the road, their single-toned colours hypnotizing you. And as you begin to lose focus your consciousness starts to slip away into truck heaven where the godess 'Scania R730' awaits you, but alas you can't have her just yet. All the while your grip on the wheel loosens to a point where the music playing over the stereo is all but a distant sound, it won't be too long before reality gives you a nice wake up call. The GPS that's holding onto the dash is telling you something-'that can't be right' you think to yourself as you calculate the situation at hand- as being an ""experienced"" truck driver you've had to deal with this kind of thing before right? But it's different this time, you're on two-landed motorway in the middle of nowhere with traffic barriers preventing your escape on either side. The GPS is showing a red line that clearly indicates you need to turn around as you've missed your turn-off... but how, there's no off-ramp for miles and this big ol' truck of yours is in no shape to be doing a U-turn in such confined spaces... Or is it?And that is the story of how you end up stuck in a ditch that could be classed as a minor hole for a couple hours somewhere in Europe waiting for an imaginary insurance company to come save you becuase you're great at delivering on time, every time. Or at least that's what you tell yourself.------------------------------------------------------ETS2 is the worth the buy, I don't think there's much more to it.			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that you will either love or hate. Personally, I love it. I first started playing SCS's trucking games with the 18 Wheels of Steel series. A friend gave me a copy of American Longhaul and it got tossed on the shelf as I thought I would have no interest in it. A few months later I decided to install it and after half an hour of play I was hooked. I then went on to put many hours into all the games in the series.I received ETS 1 in a bundle one day and set it aside to play at a later date, but I never got around to it. Then one day a friend of mine told me he had bought ETS 2 after playing my copy of ETS 1 through my shared library. He was one guy that I thought would not enjoy a truck driving simulator (in fact he originally ribbed me about playing 18WOS), so I was surprised when he started raving about it. That was enough for me to buy the game and all the DLC.Once again, I am hooked on a trucking simulator and it is great. ETS 2 is leaps and bounds above all of the previous efforts by SCS, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. There is still the problem of braindead AI drivers, but that is something you will learn to anticipate and it does not become such a problem after a while. The visuals are stunning, you just have to look at some of the screenshots to see how pretty this game is, and the truck models are fantastic. All of the trucks feel different when you drive them and you will soon find your favourites and those that you loathe to drive.With the addition of mods, especially some of the map mods available, the replay value of the game increases. There is even a multiplayer mod that regularly sees thousands of people on some of the servers. It is quite a sight to see hundreds of people lined up trying to get into Europort.The game is also linked to the  World of Trucks[www.worldoftrucks.com] website which offers external contracts, events, and more. The site is only alpha at the moment, but with the imminent release of American Truck Simulator I can see more features being revealed.As I said this is not a game for everyone, but if you like simulators and you like trucks then you will probably like this. As for whether to purchase or hold of for ATS, I would recommend buying this and then also ATS when it is released.5/5			"

												As you can tell from the name, it's a simulator. Let's just start this review off by saying, simulators are not for everyone. In Euro Truck Simulator 2 you take the wheel of a tractor trailer across Europe. You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.Pros:-Great Time Passer-Good Graphics-Very Realistic-You Drive All Across Europe-Learn How to Manage Your Own CompanyCons:-There is none, buy this game.Final Verdict:10/10			"

												Now i just edit this review for my official review.I personally like this game is awsome as although this game is not fast paced like the recent tripple games that came out like BF1 or older titles like GTA 5 but damn this game stood the test of time. It came out three years ago like GTA 5 and like GTA 5 the online is still booming. Well yes the online for this game is esentially a mod but hey Just Cause 2's Online is also a mod. Every time i go back in is game, I do a Long- Haul delivery i feel like doing it again even though it is literally 3 hours long.""Downsides"" I hear you ask. Errm i cannot really think of any because all the downsides were rectified during its development course. Wait i can think of one. The only fact that ETS2 is running on DIrect X9. But it is not really a downside because SCS software thought of the Mac users of which because of Apple idiocy of not upgrading their software SCS is forced to use Direct X9 just so Mac users are able to run the game. I hear you in the background picking up that pichfork. Put it down yes i said you. Do not start a riot because SCS wants to keep their Mac users. Because they do not want the Mac users to miss out on this superb game they made.So to sum it all up this game is lovely and this game is highly addictive just ask my friend ,Hannah, she doubted the game at first but when she picked it up she went from level zero to level 25 in no time and i cannot do anything to dissuade her from playing it anymore.Oh to add there was only two games that won two steam award. One of which is..... Euro Truck Simulator ,the other one is Grand Thief Auto 5. Just think for a while GTA 5 had a budget rivaling of a big budget hollywood blockbuster while Euro Truck Simulator was made by a small software developer in Scandivia. That shows you the scale of this game.P.S For any one who just join the sim community i would highly reccomend this game for you.P.S.S Even if you are not interested in trucks you should really pick it up because there is something soothing about dragging a 24 ton trailer with a 730 horsepower truck across europe.

												Its is, if not the best simulator out there right now. Its my most popular series on YouTube and it has a great community to it. Recently it just got a multiplayer mod which is in alpha right now, and for being in alpha, its been pretty stable and haven't ran into a bug yet.. But trolls... yes, yes I have ran into some but thats common with most games!			"

												Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game dedicated to experiencing the world of trucking from a first person perspective (although, it can be toggled to third person views). You are a trucker in Europe starting out on the job market, being employed by several different companies to complete jobs. As you gain money, you have enough to buy your own truck and complete jobs on the freight market, which pays out a considerable amount more than standard jobs. This then allows you to build up a company, hiring other truckers and buying garages in several different countries, completely switching roles from where you started at the beginning of the game.Overall I'd give it a 9/10, losing the 1 because I'm currently in debt and no matter how much I try to avoid it, some horrible driver always seems to manage to crash into my cargo.

												Inside all of us, there's an unsatiable, yet unnoticed desire inside all human beings to drive giant trucks carrying heavy cargo. However, many are scared to go out into the real world to satisfy this need, as doing so would put their lives, others' lives, and the cargo carried in danger. But where can you expirement with a playground that is wide open, realistic, AND simulated? This game has and is the answer to that question.Welcome to Euro Truck Simulator 2.Now, when I first viewed this game, I was VERY skeptical to say the least. Then I saw the demo, thought why not, only 1000 megabytes. And boy was I hooked. It was a great ride (haha) with the demo while it lasted, but it only lasted for five shipments.Then I got to contemplating. Is the price of this game worth it? As of now, yes! I am loving the game. It may not be for the hardcore Call of Duty players, but it sure can suit a wide range of other gamers.TL;DR: Fun game, great price, definately worth it.+Great graphics! The great textures help add to the feel of the game.+Great little-things-that-most-people-don't-pay-attention-to; You actually have to press keys for turn signals, windshield wipers, etc.+There are rules of the road! If you crush other cars you get fined, you also get fined for exessively going over the speed limit and running red lights!-Sadly, you cannot exit your vehicle. I feel that if this was in the game it would make it to the top of my list. I'd love to park off duty, go and customize the clothing my character has, and be able to walk around my vehicle.8/10, definately does it's job; it's simulating trucking! In Europe!			"

This game can be played forever, however it can be a tiny bit boring.CONS:1. DLC. DLC is the worst thing about this game, if they can make DLC they could have just added it to the game.¨All in all, I can definitely recommend this game. 8.5/10			"
