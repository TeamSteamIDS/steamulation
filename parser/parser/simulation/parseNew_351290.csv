								FOR THE DEVS:The game needs several improvements to make it more playable:-A better inventory system. For instance we should be able to put a gun in our inventory. We should also be able to remove clothes by hand-The needs system needs to improved. For instance my character is on the verge of dying every 5 minutes. Be it dehydration or starvation, it should be less unforgiving.-It would be nice to have servers for english speaking players and for russian players. Till now I've only met 2 english players. Since I don't speak russian it's hard for me to communicate with the other survivors.-Add actual character customization. Don't tell me it's a feature when it isn't even in the game.-It would be nice to have my fist as a weapon.-A global chat function would be nice. Some people don't own mics.-And please hire an actual native english speaking employee. Google translate items are tedious.The game is actually fun and I enjoy it. Keep up the good work.These are just my two cents. Please like so the devs can see.			"

								The recent push to beta ruined the game.You used to be able to roam the snow covered russian land scape, looking for supplies to survive and hoping to find fuel so you can light a log and stay warm for the night.Not, its a faux spring time texture set right over the old one, with the same sound effects. This is visually appaling, and combined with the horrible layout of the new maps, it is just disgusting. On top of all of this, the number of servers and players has decreased dramatically. At any given time, there are only 3 servers online, each with 5 people or less on it. This is because now they made strictly russian servers, and strictly english, and one other language. This was a horrible move by developers, and this ruined their american player base. It also removed a fun element from the gameThis game went from a solid 4/5 to, at best, a 2/5. The devs should roll back to the aplha version and fix the bugs, and make an anti-cheat that doesnt run on a potato curcuit.			"

								My first time playing the game:> I walk into a church> I find a gun and a coat> A wolf runs through a closed door> I kill the wolf using my gun> Wolf dies> A naked man walks in and starts shouting: ""GIVE ME MEAT !!""> I shoot him> He dies> After an hour or two I see the same man standing on a middle of a road with 3 other guys> He shouts something in russian> The 3 men start shooting me> I kill them with my gun> The man which was begging me for meat now begs me for mercy> I leave him> After 10 minutes a car full of Russians stops behind me and they shoot me to death> In my last seconds I hear: ""And after you kill him - take all his meat...""11/10 would meet the mighty butcher again			"

Early Access Review
								Firstly, I would like to point out that the follow points are constructively criticising the game in order to get it out of that early alpha stage. NOTE: This game doesn't have zombies in it, so if you are buying it hoping for that then you're out of luckThe good points:• Considering how new the game is, the gun play is extremely 'solid' for lack of a better phrase to describe how smooth it can feel.• The game is very well optimized, I run it at 1080p on a GTX 750 Ti paired with an i7 4790 to remove bottlenecking and I receive a solid 60 fps on maximum settings without any FPS lag whatsoever.• There is a nice amount of guns already, it has overtaken the DayZ Standalone given the amount of time the developers have put into it and I have a feeling that it will grow exponentially as soon as big Youtubers hear about it and start to play it.• The map is quite a nice size, you will have to run for a while to reach the end of the map. Whether you recieve better gear or not is really dependant on your luck.• The weather is a very nice side feature as well as a *NON-BUGGY* (I can't stress that enough when compared to DayZ) eating, and heat system.• The servers are stable enough and easy to set up and ones which you join aren't too laggy depending on your connection. (The combat sometimes get's slightly laggy, but hey ho)The Bad Points:• The only AI Enemies in the game are dogs, this by itself is fine, but there is definitely a problem with them. They spawn in packs in certain areas such as the military base and many other places far away from the generic new player spawn (very South of the map). Usually, this would feel nice and challenging but the problem generates when no loot is actually spawned at the military base apart from an odd M1911 magazine with 4 bullets in it. Whoopee.. This can be tested by creating a fresh server with brand new shiny loot (Dare I say), and you will see that there are too many dogs considering the lack of good loot. To improve, reverse their spawns and make them spawn in the wild and not near what was once human civilisation to encourage players not to wander off.• The melee combat is for one, dubious. It seems that the hit boxes on enemies and dogs in particular are very tiny, and in order for you to deal some damage, you need to be within licking range, fair enough for man to man combat, but when it comes to dogs, it's a big no no when you think about how many you will have to kill.• The heat system is too unforgiving. Staying inside with a jacket on still lowers your temperature, and once it gets to roughly 25 degress ᶜᶦᵗᵃᵗᶦᵒᶰ ᶰᵉᵉᵈᵉᵈ your health starts to slowly decrease. The second part I don't have a problem with, but the only way to get your temperature is to create a fire which requires an axe to get firewood, lighter fluid (I think?) and a lighter. The chance of finding everything for that is pretty slim• Similar to the heat system, the health system is VERY unforgiving. Running into dogs and surviving will probably take your health down the the 'Wounded' or 'Severely Wounded' stage. The only way to get your health back up is to take medicine of some description which is recognised by a generic 'Bottle o' Peels' and those pills are.. Yes you guessed it.. Extremely Rare. To improve this, they should allow your health to regenerate slowly as long as your other basic needs are satisfied.• There isn't a full tutorial for noobs who have no clue what they're doing. Some people who have played a lot of survival games take to it very quickly, but they will soon come to a halt somewhere. For instance, the weapon reloading system in itself is quite complicated at first, but you can get the hang of it. What annoyed me is how some of the guns were in Russian meaning you couldn't understand what they were called and look up their calibre on Wikipedia. Adjacent to the name of the gun, the type of ammo should be displayed so you know exactly what ammo to look out for.• One teeny tiny point is that my guns seem to not fire exactly when I need them to, and ammo doesn't seem to stack very effectively sometimes. This is more of a minor bug than a problem.• When you die, sometimes there will be a spectator mode in which you can see everyone meaning if you know one area well, you can track them down if you're lucky enough. Fair enough if you're on other side of the map, but if you're in the spawn then it can become a problem rather quickly. No neeed to explain that one ;-)• The final point isn't too much of a problem, but the servers seem to sort depending on how many people are actually in them, meaning you can't join a game that your friend has created if it's just them in it. And no, there's no option to join via Steam. This isn't much of a problem but sometimes it's nicer just to have a game with your friends are gear up before venturing into the big, bandity world.EDITS:• The guns don't fire because they either 'need oil' or 'need repair' (or broken if heavily used but not maintained) These are all of the points I have collected so far, and don't be discouraged by the sheer amount of negative comments I have hopefully successfully conveyed. There are far many more good points such as atmosphere and looting system that I could've writtne about, but they're so small individually that they aren't worth it, they do however create a massive difference when put together in an online game.Overall I definitely recommend this to people who enjoy survival games and are looking to support the developers in order for them to improve this already outstanding game. Dean 'Rocket' Hall can shove that so called effort he has been putting into the DayZ mod up his buttocks and salute these developers who are much closer to the community.If you wish to ask me any questions about the game, feel free to message me on Steam, I'm not the most experienced person but i'll try my best to answer any questions-Jacob :)			"

Early Access Review
								     This game does have potential, especially at this price, however a few major issues are holding this game back.  First of which is the dehydration mechanic.  For the rarity of finding water the dehydration bar drains much too fast.  It either needs to drain slower or more water/juice/soup needs to be spawned in the game.  The second major problem is the wolves.  Often times I spawn in looking for loot in a building only for a wolf to run in and start attacking me.  If I don't have a weapon there isn't much I can do to defend myself as the character runs out of stamina too quickly and the wolf can easily kill you.  Also the wolves can find you much too easily often I'll be on the second floor of a building and wolves will come from miles away outside, run into the building, climb up the stairs and run into my room.  Again if I haven't found a weapon by that point suicide is the best option because I have no way of getting away.  Also the hit detection seems pretty off, many times I've been in a firefight with someone and shoot them multiple times at close range with a shotgun only for them to switch to an axe and hit me once or twice with it and kill me.  Overall this game is solid for the price.  I have had many fun moments in intense firefights; frantically trying to loot the bodies of the players I has just slain.  Unfortunately these moments are too far and few inbetween and some of the mechanics are so game breaking that I cannot recommend this game until they are addressed.			"

								It's a great game and I've had a ton of fun with it, but the fact that there are hackers on all the time now really ruins it. There is nothing worse than shooting a guy and while looting his items you suddenly die because the guy you killed respawned and used some form of aim bot to shoot you from way out in the woods. It wouldn't be so bad if that were to happen only once in a while but it happens every time I play... Long story short, good game but the hackers kill it and it has been far too long without a fix.

								The game is completely worth 5$The graphics look amazing, and it runs so smoothly.If you're into DayZ, but don't have the money or the best computer, you should definitely give this game a try.Pros:-Graphics are really good-Runs smoothly on almost any computer-A lot of people don't KoS (Kill on Sight)-Just came out, so they're adding new things every day.-It's fun to create buildings with the crafting systemCons:-There aren't options where you can change mouse sensitivity, -Just came out, and not a lot of people are playing it.-Animations can be a little weird (Which makes the game fun sometimes)-You can spectate other players after death, which can cause people to learn where people are, which ruins the survival feeling,Edit: The dev's have pretty much gave up on this game, so there's barely any updates, and about no one plays it any more. It sucks because I really enjoyed this game and wanted to watch it grow to be something bigger. Right now I probably wouldn't buy it if you want something  that will last a long time.			"

								Really dissapointing. Played just over 6 hours I think, and Im calling it a day. In those hours, I played on the busiest servers, about 8-9 players, and I only ever met one person.  We stood opposite each other, at around 20ft distance, unloaded our guns on each other, and neither of us took any hits!?  I have shot many a charging wolf before you say it is my aim :PThe wolves are a relentless pain, and sometimes you will be spawned next to some, which means you have to run and hope for the best, as you have no ability to punch or kick these hungry little cretins.  Loot is scarce, you'll find yourself sprinting from building to building, searching endless empty cupboards and drawers, before you starve or dehydrate. If your lucky enough to find these resources, you'll probably freeze to death, as this is another element to contend with, and being fully clothed in winter gear and standing in a house is apparently not enough.  Theres loads of bugs, screen goes black whilst the sound continues, getting stuck in floors etc, but I expected these to be fair.  If this game was free, it might be worth a couple of hours of your time, if you have the patience of a saint.  As it currently stands, Id say keep your cash.			"

								As much as I really hate to say it I cannot reccomend this game, at the moment. When I first picked this up it was pretty damn good, needed a lot of work but it was good, WAS. The recent transition into ""Beta"" had royally buggered this game. The map is too empty. I spawned at a petrol station and spend over 10 minutes walking along a straight road and found nothing. After I suicided I found a ""TT"" pistol, it took 1911 mags, I found some ammo and another empty mag and tried to load it, nada. I then unloaded the mag that I had in my gun to find it had .357 ammo, went to put it back into the clip, nada. I then had no usable ammo. I went to explore after this point and found that the ""Jumping"" sound effect was so much louder than the others that I nearly fell off my chair in fright. The effect of running on grass makes your character sound like he's running over shrapnel or bullet casing.TL;DR - The recent ""update"" has totally ♥♥♥♥ed the game, if I'd written this a few months ago it would have been a totally different review. With that in mind: keep an eye on this game if interested. The Devs have taken some wrong turns BUT the game WAS good so there's no reason it can't be good again, given time and a new approach to ""updates"".			"

								PLEASE Don't pay any attention to reviews from players with not even 1 hour of play time.. They most likely died because they are♥♥♥♥♥♥and didn't know what to do.. SURPRISE SURPRISE!! This game is actually decent. Just earlier I was running around one of the towns and got gunned down.. When I respawned, I was lucky enough to find an old rifle and some ammo close by and walked back to the person looting my gear. I lined him up and BOOM HEADSHOT. Took all of my stuff back and most of his aswell.. It was very intense.. This game has created a very real world feel. There is no chat, which I think is AWESOME. Means you don't get any spam or ♥♥♥♥♥es having a good cry.. There is voice chat for when you are close to someone or if you have a walkie talkie you can talk to anyone in the same town as you..There are only 2 bad things about this game:1. There aren't enough players yet to be able to always play against people, sometimes you feel like you are playing solo game..2. Limited content and small bugs, but hey... It's early alpha, what do you expect? And it's $5.. C'mon.All in all, it's a fun game and well worth your $5. Give it a good chance, play it for a couple hours, look up some guides if you get stuck. If there was more people giving it a chance then it would be such a fun game for everyone to play!			"

As soon as me and my friends load up we both started looting and met up very fast, in fact it is really easy to find friends because from what I notice you spawn close to each other at the start. But after that you can then make your way into the wild ^_^.      When I got on I found a shotgun with no ammo, so  I then started to walk around for more loot and bumped into anther player. He had an axe while I had a Shottie with no ammo even tho unknowingly he dropped his axe and begged bot to be shot. And so I took is axe and ran off.     The later on I met another guy in a small cabin and started talking to him, but suddenly 3 Russians came up and started shooting at our cabin.  My new companion said ''hey this is the end'', lets us run out there and Shout! Allu Akbar'' And so we did and managed to escape until I died from my wounds. My friend who bought the game with me in the first place met a guy and asked if he wanted to be friends, the new guy said '' Yes'' And so I and my 2 friends made are way to the construction site only to find a pile of guns from dead players in the woods on the way there. We then hunkered down in the construction site and started make a fire till I heard foot steps out side. We told them to drop there weapons after I seen them through a window upstairs, but of course they shot at us and we fought back, and I'm telling you now the way the game handles when it comes to PvP shooting feels so good and I actually thought I was In a big firefight, we were calling out info and places while hold up in the building and man is was good. Eventually we won and reaped the rewards :).  10/10			"

								DO NOT BUY THIS GAMEHistory of this game as I know it:Beta: the devs release an open world survival game set in siberia, it is developed to near completion and is a fun game although still has some quirks that need to be worked out.Summer version: Instead of fixing the game that already exists the devs decide that they want to make a WHOLE NEW GAME that occurs in the summer ( previous game was in winter) so do they take the previous game and reskin the terrain in summer green instead of artic snow? HELL NO they create an ENTIRELY NEW GAME that runs like crap because the whole map is covered with flowers that move in the wind, and devs obviously still havn't figure out how occlusion works. This version goes over like a lead baloon and in response devs DELETE THE ENTIRE FORUM! then they ""re-release"" the old version, which still works ok but they don't fix the bugs that people have known about for ever.Current (alpha?) version: Ok never mind that the devs don't know what way the greek alphabet goes ( beta comes after alpha) After almost a year of no communication at all with their community the devs announce the release of an ENTIRELY NEW GAME. Do they return to the best working most popular version of the game and fix teh known issues? HELL NO they release 3 tiny unfinished ""sectors"" and call it a game. Then they drop off the face of the earth for 2 months.. that brings us here. The game randomly bans people that can play it, doesnt' let many people play at all, and quickly gets old after you take an hour to explore everything that you can, get mauled by the packs of OP dogs, die from lack of water when surrounded by snow, or can't find any loot because other players have walled off all the buildings in protest (thats right you can build walls, but can't destroy them leading to the landscape being littered with imersion breaking impossible structures and sky grafitti. There is NO SUPPORT AT ALL for anyone who has an issue, and since it is EA you can not get a refund.Oh yeah.. and all the while the devs are trying to get ANOTHER game with the SAME ASSETS green lit on steam.. for once steam makes the right choice and tells them ""um how about you guys finish the game you started first?"" I thought this was a good game, but now it seems like a cash grab with asset flip every few months to make it seem like its still being worked on.This game has nothing but potential.. if only there was someone there to develop it.

								Survival Postapocalypse now! is perhaps one of the best games I have played, great PvP featuring easy communication with other players and a real fun game and with over one thousand hours gameplay under my belt I have met some really cool people to play with or against,  Unfortunately it has a lot of bugs, glitches and lag not to mention some other annoying factors  including a kill cam that gives away your position to the other players you are in combat with, however all these problems could be easiy fixed with some effort, yet there is no support from the developers ( who gave up answering their customers back in March 2016) and now the game is over-run with cheats, ridiculously over run by cheats. If you want to play this as an honest player then you can expect to be shot through a wall or from across large distances on the map with one shot kills, other players teleporting, Spawning in loot, duplicating  and  bringing in banned weapons to name a few dissapointments.Oh and as for bans... there is currently no way to ban cheats either permenantly or temporaily as there is apparently a cheat they can use to unban themselves. The game is ruined and now 90% of the players I meet use cheats, it's a shame because with a few tweeks this could have be an awesome game. Steam need to come down heavy on the developers for abandoning this game and for letting down every honest player who purchased this game in good faith. Shame on you TB Games, in any other industry you would perhaps have faced penalties  for allowing this game to go the way it did, but TB Games have gotten away with this complete lack of professionalism and hides behind this 'early access' malarkey. I would suggest that no one spends another cent on this game unless it is fixed and a competent  anti-cheat system incorporated. SHAME ON YOU TB GAMES. you let your community down			"

								Hi there, as you may have already noticed, I have clocked into this game well over 100 hours. I have been playing this game since early development and have seen the many ""improvements"" that have been made by developers. However, there is one thing that I need to address, one thing that really upsets me about the recent update you made (2 months ago) with starting off each user in a Prison. Take into consideration the element of simplicity, prior to when you implemented the Prison into the game, the game was simple, me and my friend had a favored area that had a church, several small houses, a wood factory and what looked to be a temple. Roaming around this area, meeting newcomers and inviting them into our journeys or killing them on the spot was the thing that made this game great. But you completely removed that, and it hasn't been the same since.I've played this game alot. Really, alot. And I have tried to love the whole Prison concept. Don't get me wrong, I thought, originally, it was great. Although it was a bit confusing to comprehend why you're a prison inmate who woke up with a major headache with a sudden post apocalypse on his hands, but believe me, I tried to enjoy it.But when I came to the realization that you removed the one area that I loved so much, my love for the game itself slowly disintegrated. This area was the common area for everyone to meet up and it was easy to navigate around, why remove it?The simplistic nature of the game was ruined, you haven't made any changes to this game in months and a game with such potential is slowly dying off me.You can also tell that this is slowly dying off others too, months back it was hitting online numbers of 470 to 600 and more, but now you'd be lucky if there were over 50 users online. This update and lack of improvements is evident now, surely.Please listen to one of your most loyal players, please bring back that area, and please get rid of the Prison or something. It really doesn't make sense. I highly recommend this game, I think that it has potential as I said, if the developers update it regularly and listen to its consumers. I want you to fix this. Thank you.			"

I wander around for another 15 minutes because the tutorial doesnt tell me where to go. We spawn into a server. We appear in the middle of the freezing Russian winter, in a trainyard. We cannot meet up, because we are separated by a player-built indestructible wall. I find a revolver. I find bullets.I cannot load the bullets into the gun, even through the caliber matches. We finally meet up, and go exploring. After looting some buildings, I find a helicopter wreck. I go inside. I become stuck inside a wall, and cannot escape. My friend puts me out of my misery. I am left with a cam of my corpse, while heavy breathing sounds♥♥♥♥♥♥my ears at a massive volume. This continues for 5 minutes - I cannot respawn. I Alt+F4. This does nothing.

								This game is actually very nicely optimized and runs super smoothly for such a small team/project. I am also really loving the way you search for loot (actually open drawers and cabinets to look inside it for loot). They also have a good focus on PvE in terms of body temperature and wildlife. I believe the player base is pretty dead, but I kind of like it as it feels realistically barren. Hoping to run into someone at some point however. Would like to see more people check this out!			"

Alot of those reviews talk about crashes or the game being dead, but i have yet to experience those problems after 10h of playtime.

								I join the game and I'm greeted by the presence of another player. ""Hello friend!"" I say to him. He stares back at me intensely and doesn't mutter a word. As he raises his gun in my face I say to him, ""I was wondering if you could possibly show me the ropes? I'm quite new to this game and-"" and before I finish I hear a loud crackling static over his mic and in what I can only assume is a Russian accent he replies, ""Uhh, English... Err, not so good."" I think to myself, ""What an exciting adventure this will be, he doesn't speak English and I don't speak Russian... Fantastic""Almost immediately we became great friends. Running around, finding loot, wondering what we were saying to eachother, what an experience it was. Our adventure however was short-lived. We arrived in a town where other people were looting, they were far more geared than myself or my Russian friend. He had a shotgun and I was alongside him with my trusty pistol in hand. A pistol he had given me. Not only was this man welcoming to me, but he trusted me enough to give me a fully loaded sidearm. An act of kindness which I will never forget.We tried our best to avoid people as much as we possibly could. We went into a house, 2 story, with lots of rooms. We were both upstairs when I hear a car approach and stop outside. ""They got the jump on us man! Bail, Bail!"" I yell. Franticly I try to escape with my greatest ally. He rushed downstairs taking point with his shotgun and I tried peaking from the window, but they were gone...so we thought. Suddenly I hear a ripple of shots being fired and my friend yells, ""♥♥♥♥♥!"" I rush to help him but he's already dead. In a split second I react to the sound of a gun being reloaded and I deduce that it's coming from behind the shed behind the house. I rush back there and fire every shot I can into the sad sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥that killed my travel buddy. ""You've been avenged my friend..."" I say out loud. ""Oh♥♥♥♥♥♥.. Where is the other one? He's gotta-"" But before I finish that thought everything went black and the respawn clock was counting down. I never did find out the name of my travel buddy, but I know he's still out there... somewhere. R.I.P. #NeverForget(True story by the way... As for my review. [Cons]The hunger system is a little crazy, not enough food in the game to stay alive for very long. The wildlife is relentless and are very hard to lose on foot. I also don't know how the vehicles work haha. The transitions into some areas don't work sometimes. There was a bug where when I dropped my gun it would lose it's ammo which has set me back a few times.--[Pros] The player encounters while sometimes can be tough to communicate with people, makes for very interesting gameplay. The exploration is pretty fun. You are limited to how far you can go but there's also a good chance of getting lost. I guess some would consider that a con but I like the feeling of not knowing where to go, that's all part of being an adventure game :P)I'm typing this late at night so it's probably riddled with spelling mistakes and punctuation issues and I don't typically do reviews so sorry if it was♥♥♥♥♥♥lol. I think the game is worth playing. I enjoyed it for a quite a bit.			"

								So far, so good, I just saw the game previews on Youtube, bought it, played it, and for an early alpha, looks great, Still, more needs to be done, Here's one of many of my suggestions:1 -> NO ZOMBIES. Seriously, I'm tired of zombie games, please don't add them, add other things, such as bandits for weaponry, scavengers for random loot/tools, Survivors for everyday needs (food).2  -> More AnimalsYup, we need more meat, more fur, because WINTER IS COMING!and we need to freak out the cold ice on our bodies.3 -> Stress SystemWell, It would be awesome if you could implement a stress system...It could be unique for the game... If you hear a wolf howling, it would scare you ingame, and the stress would rise..You hear footsteps? Well, time take a deep breath, and prepare yourself..Gunshots? RUN, or face courage yourself...That way, the more stress you have, the more that your hands would shake..How do you fix you stress?Simple, Lighter + cigarettes for the nerves, or a little vodka.Or, if you ain't a smoker/drinker, try to face your fears/stress, so that your used of your dangerous, that the word ''Stress'' doesn't mean nothing to you anymore. 4 -> You guys need to implement a ''Suggestions'' Board on your steam game's forum, so that people would suggest things for you, so that the game would be well received for us all...Everyone loves to have their ideas posted, and replied by the game developers.For now, this would be great addictions for the game, and I hope that the developers would consider my suggestions, along with others suggestions from the community.I hope, that in the future, I could add even more suggestions, a great hug/kiss for the developers, and I hope that you could construct a FABULOUS game!7/10 for a great early alpha gameCheers <3			"

								So I purchased the game today, I have enjoyed it...here is what I have found so far...1. Lost everything when I had to log out...bummer, had good loot...2. Mouse wheel changes between melee weapon and ranged weapon3. G key drops equipped weapon so you can drop revolver you found in drawer and pick up auto pistol you found in another drawer.4. double right click on ammo in inventory and click on matching ammo in inventory to combine.5. double right click on ammo in inventory and click on matching magazine in inventory to load magazine6. so far have not figured out how to put magazine into equiped pistol (maybe dont have correct magazine for the pistol)7. Do not know how to load rounds into revolver (maybe dont have correct ammo for revolver) R key should be reload, but with no control mapping layout hard to determine and with hitting random keys on the keyboard and no message coming up (wrong ammo for type of weapon equipped) hard to tell.8. Finding a backpack increases your inventory. YAY!9. Found gasoline/lighter fluid with second character10. Found lighter with third character11. Died by wolf with first character as I could not hit it with my barefists, respawn gave me a baseball bat to restart. Hitting random keys to figure out what key was reload logged me out of my character and sent me back to log in menu where I lost my whole inventory and had to start over (suck!) New character starter with baseball bat. Killed wolf, got meat. Cant cook meat...12. Found a map!!! shows the area, need to take a screen shot and print it out.13. Found lots of weapons, lots of food, lots drinks, cant carry them all, get hungry fast, get thirsty fast, cant find a place to rest...cant find a place to save so I dont lose everything when I log out, dont know how to log out without losing everything...cant use beds (or have not found a bed that is usable) found apartment buildings with doors that close, that are safe from elements and wildlife, but can not sit on chairs/sofas or sleep in beds.I recommend the game for the price, early access, but the game does need a booklet or a screen that covers keyboard commands and maybe a bit of a walkthrough.***just played after the patch***Okay, after patch, either I found the correct ammo or R now works to reload and I have correct ammo for the revolver, still dont have an automatic and magazines to check on that aspect yet. Getting cold too fast and this time around not finding any coats, however i did find an axe and hammer and started playing around with building a structure, then someone killed me, respawned and only found an axe so cant play around with the building aspect of the game anymore, but it is kind of fun. gonna check out the help system that was just implemented in the menu and see what that is all about.

								Alright. I don't normally write reviews but I deemed this one necessary for everyone. An hour, a simple hour is all I needed to see what this game really is. I would constantly get harrassed by other players spawn camping in the old version. That's fixed now. But only to have arisen anew. There seems to only be 3-4 spawn points on this new map, and yes, they are getting camped again. When you do manage to make it out of the camp mania, you will not find any weapons, I spent a good chunk of my time looking for weapons in buildings and on other dead player bodies that somehow always seem to be laying around inside of walls.The hackers: ♥♥♥♥ loads, can't seem to get around the wasteland without running into atleast 5 in an hour. You'll see them flying, spawning stuff, and downright banning your account with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t cracked admin version of the game.The Anticheat: Doesn't Exist.RESEARCH: I did some research into this game and learned that this game is just a continuation of a FACEBOOK GAME. Yes that's right, this game was on facebook. It was originally on facebook, it also was only in russian and had no objective towards itself what-so-ever. FACEBOOK LINK: https://apps.facebook.com/survival_z/?fb_source=sidebar_bookmarkOverall I give this game 0/10.No creativityRehaul of a Facebook Game.Horrible MovementFeels like Infestation / WarZ all over again.

								Still very early in development.. but my initial response is that this game looks already to be running decent and offer a better online game to play in then some $20 online survival games like this.If you like these kind of games, it's probably worth your $5, but it is certainly not the best game of this kind available right now as games like Rust, 7 Days To Die, DAYZ, Reign of Kings, and H1Z1 are probably all much more complete games (and likely have many more players right now)Here is my ""First Play on Launch Day"" First Impressions Video:

								The developers thought they needed to start from scratch with a new game, people FREAKED OUT.So they changed their minds, seeing we didn't want that, and they are working on a really big update that they are going to push any day. They have been releasing frequent updates and pictures. It seems like they are doing everything right, but people are just really upset from that initial shock of them wanting to abandon it.They changed their plans because of how we reacted, and that shows that they aren't just looking for a cash-grab. Ignore all the people slinging the hate comments because of 'abandonment'.It's early access, and they treat it like early access. They are working on it.These devs try really hard. I think it's terrible that people are so angry at them still, even though they saw the error of their ways and did exactly what we were asking, which was more updates.Give the devs a break and buy their game, it's dirt cheap and solid gameplay.

								I saw this game and it looked like a game my friend could run since he doesn't have a very good computer so we both bought it and he gets 30-35 fps which is playable for him so this game can run on low end pc's. The game is capped at 60fps from what i see and i don't know if they have plans to change that. This game also has a lot already developed into it like a variety of cars (cough cough dayz cough cough) and a lot of weapons, the problem though is it's really hard to find a gun atm because of people camping the places they spawn in giving them an unfair advantage. The spawns in this game should be different and you should spawn randomly on the map rather than spawning in the same area you died in, this would get rid of spawn killing. I hope if this game gets more popular they will add US Servers because 70% of the time you will find russian people and can't understand them so they KOS. This game feels nice and smooth and whats its worth i think its worth the $6. Devs have stated that they are adding better Anti-Cheat and are adding a new map soon.Overall i give this game a 7/10			"

								For the price it's fun to mess around with. I'd start in a low  pop server until you can figure out how the game works some because it's a bit frustrating at ttimes. Seems like there is always one more piece you need to have a working gun and while searching, BLAM, someone pops u in the head with their working gun.I have yet to find shoes. I have found hats, shirts, gas masks and even am officers lid but no shoes. I do run into this dude on a server every once in a while that only has camo pants and a really sweet pair of kicks! My one and only goal nopw is to get this gun working, find that server and hunt that dude down for his kicks and I will have won the game, imho!This game is getting better. The more you explore, the better it gets. Don't stay in the area they start you at. I'm not sure if everyone starts way south but it gets better the more you play so don't give up. It does get very frustrating at times and I hope the Dev's add a little more to the rng as I have spent over an hour looking for a lighter on this last play and if you are playing solo, you won't live long without finding one this long.Want a pretty cool story(I think it is)?   vv Down here vvhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/351290/discussions/0/620713633847744255/ "

								What I liked: The overall feel to the game Travelling from one area to another area reduces the lag build up Not another Zombie survival game Crafting is good but needs improvement Noises are a bit loud but given you a chance at hearing people.What I did not like: Killed 10 times without even gaining a gun or some form of weapon Upon spawning in: Had nothing in Inv, not even a water bottle or snack. No chance to build a base. All players are set to KOS, no community help Wolves are a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥br>    No form of fist fighting: Melee spawning locations are a bit off since I was spawned right in the center of a gangs area. Opening and closing doors/hatches etc is a major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Pressed ""E"" 9 times before a door could be opened standing stationary. It's DayZ without Zombies, but instead major pain in the♥♥♥♥♥players.One senario:Joined a server, found a cabin, 2 more guys show up, Im wearing a gas mask and that's all no food or water or anything else.First guy: Think he has food?Second guy: Lets find outBefore I can even say ""Im new, I do not have anything but this gas mask""Me: On the ground dead due to a shotgun blast to the head.First guy: He had nothingSecond guy: ♥♥♥♥ing Noobs man, wish they'd learn to play the gameSo now It's like Dayz without Zombies; with Rust's Community.

								This game reminds me of a mix of The Long Dark, Rust, And DayZ(just no zombies). Although the graphics may not look as advanced as those titles i just referenced, you get past the fact that they are not that great. Remember this is an alpha. With that being said, alphas are meant to be tested and improved, therefore if you decide to buy this game dont expect everything to work how you would like it yet. I believe that after this game reaches its beta state it will be very successful.P.S. When you start playing expect to get killed a lot, and i mean A LOT. The Russians who play this game kill you pretty much no matter what you do, even if you just spawned. Also please dont press the cheater button out of anger, a lot of people are getting banned when they didn't do anything. It makes it hard for the developers to have to handle those cases, so please be considerate. Part of the game is getting killed, and if you dont like it this game isn't for you, otherwise add this title to your Steam Library.			"

								I do reccomend this game for 5 bucks, it is really fun, there are no zombies (it gives the game a more wasteland feel to it)  But DO NOT buy this game for the trailer you see, now of course I haven't explored the whole map yet because death seems to find me one way or another.  That is also another thing, you always spawn in the same general area, what I've come to call ""freshspawn valley"" where basically the game starts.  You move from area to area looting houses making it as far across the map until you die, if a player doesn't get you, its pretty much guerenteed a silent wolf, the cold, or accidently falling off a building will.  Back to the trailer thing, I haven't found many weapons beyond a 1911, 2 revolvers (which use the same ammo pretty sure there is no dmg diff), and a shot gun.  I've found ammo for other guns but I have searched and searched to find nothing, no mosins, no assault rifles, just double barrel shot guns, I haven't even seen an assault rifle mag..But that is just a warning about what you see in the trailer is not what you will be buying, the game is still entertaining and its very fun to explore and loot.  There is a good voip system so you can talk to people, idk how many english speaking players there are though because every person I come across speaks russian and that language barrier is impossible to overcome and it normally ends with someone dying.  With the way the melee hit detection currently is and the glitches I've found in the game I'd have to give it a 6/10 in this early access state, not to say that rating won't go up, I hope the devs work hard to improve this game and make it the great game it should be.

								This game is worth the $5 dollars! It's like DayZ but without zombies and is a very playable. If you want to play a DayZ like game, then this is for you. It also runs good on very low end PC's if you do happen to have one. Pros:-Runs well on older/lower end PC's-Very playable-Crafting is available-Updates everyday-Very fun with friends-Graphics are decent Cons:-Low player base-Everything is still very alpha-Clunky animations-No customizable settings other than graphics-Spectating after death which tells you exactly where other players are and what they have on them-Many players are Russian (From my experience) and most of them (Not trying to be offensive, yet again from my experience) are very agressive and will KOS. -Server hoppingI recommend you buy this game nevertheless as it will greatly increase the player base and will encourage the developers to keep working on the game.

								Sorry Devs, I really want to enjoy this game - trust me I do - but I really can't do that until you add a dedicated options/settings menu.For example: there's no setting allowing me to change my mouse sensitivity, therefore I'm having to do a full arc with my arm just to do a 180° turn. Other things are also prohibiting me from wanting to play this game further such as no option to change the FOV; the sound (it's really annoying when you jump and the character just roars 'HUUUUUUH' at me; also no key binding option.Honestly Devs these are just the small things I think you need to take a look at, I'm sure I'd have enjoyed the game if I'd played it for longer, I just can't seem to enjoy something when I can't tinker with the settings to make it play how I'd like to play - and I'm sure this applies to many other people too.I'll revist this game in a few weeks/months to see how it's progressed because I am genuinely looking forward to sinking some hours in to it once a few option features have been added.

								I'd recommend not buying this game what so ever, While the base ""idea"" is good and was going alright for some time it's now sadly abandoned.Last I personally heard of and seen anything by the developer of this is a statement on gamejolt basically stating that he quits.So for your own good, Do not buy this game, there will be no futher updates and where the game was left before it was abandoned had some issues to begin with, but now they've only gotten worse, rendering it unplayable.

								Cool game but not much to do yet and no tutorial so you just kind of have to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with stuff till you figure it out. It runs pretty well even on my stock hp laptop. Has nice visuals even if it is overly dark but I turned down the quality and things lighten up making things easier to see. At the end of the day 5$ is a good price especially if you want to give feedback and help the game grow and change as it develops. Cool game and definitely worth a look.			"

								So far this game is amazing. For the price of $5 it makes total sense to buy it now.Theres a few issues, ways you can get stuck, bugs, crashes every now and again. But its not bad.For how much they seem to be developing this game and the community starting to really back it. I think it is worth $20 as it is right now.Main issues i have had in game are with players, not hackers, just players killing on sight.But if you are like me, and play with a group (we are 10 strong right now) its no issue meeting up and being a huge force to deal with.P.S. if you want to join the team add me on steam, we will set you up			"

								I first played this, I don't know, many months ago. I kind of forgot about it for a while, due to a new kid being born and not sleeping and crying all the time (me, not the kid... well, OK, me AND the kid.)So I go back to play it recently, and there is nobody online.Not one. Single. Player.Further, when I tried to start up a server just to see what has changed... it stays on the loading screen. None of the listed ways of helping (firewall exceptions, disabling antivirus) helped.A pity; this game had some real potential. Now it's just a steaming pile of russian deer turd.			"

								!!!DON'T READ THE BAD REVIEWS PLEASE!!!This game is awesome if played with friends! I have played many hours and YET to meet a cheater!For 5$ this game is totally worth it! There are many things to do and many places to search for awesome loot! Decent variety of guns for such a game. Buy it! You dont have anything lose. And you might make some friends during your gameplay!Game rating 9/10( I dont give 10/10 because i have issues with the servers and my ping is constantly 100 and above )***EDIT*** As of today 29/2/2016 i have met 2 cheaters in my entire playtime.... Both of them got banned after pressing the ""CHEATER!"" button, so i guess the game developers !CARE! about their game!			"

								So.. After several, SEVERAL hours I have put into the free version, I decided to buy the actual release.  If you haven't played any version of this game, I reccomend you to atleast try it. For $4.99, it is really cheap for a game now-a-days.  Especially for the survival genre. It may be difficult at first for some becuase of NO tutorial or any guaidance at all, but once youu get the hang of it and no what to do, this game can be a blast! From the free version before actual release to now, they have done quite a bit of stuff. At the moment, I would give this game a 7/10 becuase there isn't really that much to do right now but that should change as the developement goes on. I still highly recommend it though.			"

								Obviously inspired from DayZ, ""Survival: Postapocalypse Now"" puts its own spin on survival.  One improvment over DayZ is the responsivness of the controls.  You won't see any zombies running about, but the humans opponents are as dangerous as ever.  Will you be a ""friendly"" and work cooperativly, or kill anyone you see on sight?

								I'm going to change my previous reccomendation to a positive one now. I know it's been rough for me and I've posted my share of complaints but, I do feel the devs are working on the issues at hand and are trying their best to fix everything. The feedback they've been getting from everyone has more than likely, been of great help. The posts about glitching, loot finding, placement of this and that and about all the hackers in game. This is being taken care of or, so they say. However, they have mentioned several times that, they know who all is hacking and it will be fixed and to add, all those that are hacking, will be permanantly banned from all, S:PAN servers once the final released is ready. My most positive impression about the game is, it's definately running smooth. I've not had many games that run as smooth as this one does, even more-so, with an 159ms ping. No matter what server I'm playing on, the game runs great. Nothing concerning issues I've had with it are, per the servers the game is running on. They're up, 24/7 and have never crashed, that I know of? Switching from server to server is not an issue at all. Alt/F4 out, switch server and bingo, you're there. I'm not sure if this is true wth everyone though and I play it with a 64bit system, not a 32bit system. I also don't know if that has anything to do with it or, not? If I was having any actual connection issues with the game, I'd of quit playing it a long time ago and in my games profile, it would probably show you less than 30mins played. It's an Old School type of game play configuration and perfect for PC/M & KB players. Is it worth the $5-6? Yes, even more-so at this stage. The devs have already stated that, everyone playing it now, will get the completed, full version at this price and if not, the rest will have to pay the full price for the game once, it's released. So, if you got $5 to spare and want to help track down hackers, kill hackers and/or, all these frkn wolves/bears in the game, get it and when the final is ready, prepare to gank or, get ganked.As an added note: This game is playable on XP for those of you who still use them for lower end games..It's not a bad game and I have over 200 hours into it. I plan to have more.===============================Edit: It is not advisable to play this game on XP. A friend got it and it really messed up his system. He was getting very low fps in game and couldn't even create/join a server. He tried changing screen reso and it messed up the system once he left the game. Now, he can't return his screen back to it's normal scale. If you have a beefed up system with a version of XP then, it may work. "

								This game is Extremely well done, it has ups and downs like any other game, but for the short amount of time this game has been up I have thoroughly enjoyed it. I would write an entire speech about this game but a short what they can add in my opinion would be best.What the developers could add to this game is chests and beds!! You can build a lovly base with nice rooms but there is no point. You can't sleep there and you can't store your items anywhere forcing you to take the bare essentials.Another thing the developers could add to this game is the ability to transfer your guns into your inventory. If this was implemented the game would be a whole lot better then it already is.These are just afew things i thought the developers could have added to make this game Better. One last thing, Remove the Esc Key Log. I use the Esc key to exit my inventory with every game and when I do it with this game it goes back to the main menu. Remove that Please it's very frustrating when I do it.I hope this review was helpful and Thanks for reading!			"

								I liked the game, like the gameplay, the way it looks, it ran very smooth for me, combat wasnt to bad comparred to some bigger named games. This is hard to decide on wether or not to recomend itor not as well, the game is good the devs seem either really slow or this is it and I feel if this it then no its north worth buying.There isnt even any decent dev news posted nothing which I feel is direspectful of the buyers/fans.so actually for that reason I dont recommend it			"

								Ok, there's a lot of bad opinions from people that haven't really tried to play the game, once you get further in the map, you get more stuff, everything is easier to do, guns aren't rare, don't get fully geared, get a gun with enough ammo and kill someone and take their stuff.Place I recommend to loot at for  major gear: FactoryYeah, there's hackers every so on, they spawn♥♥♥♥♥♥but aimbot/wallhack, I don't think so, the closest thing to wallhack that everyone uses is when their friend dies they spectate others in the area to tell them where you are.Glitches: One abused glitch is people glitch into the rock on the mountain and shoot people through it and not be seen, sometimes mods disapear off your guns when you die along with your shirt but dupes when you find another shirt of any kind.75% people you run into are russian, so watch yourself, most are aggressive in my opinion.Good things in my opinion: Spawns aren't over powered, mechanics are simple and clean (most at least), not many glitches, more development than DayZ Standalone.Bad things in my opinion: Too many wolves, they get annoying and constantly bite you, agro needs to be lowered, cars are a little too slidey while driving, some glitches that people exploit that get annoying. Fist can't be used. Easy to get stuck.The game is a little confusing but put time into it.ALSO MAKE SURE TO PLAY WITH FRIENDS			"

								The game isn't that bad. I feel a lot can be done. One issue i do hate is how many wolves spawn. Kind of sucks when you start with nothing and a wolf is already attacking you. If there's going to be a lot of wolves around at least put more med kits or bandaids out for us. Maybe even try to let us create our own bandaids like cloth with duck tape, something. I might just have the worst luck with finding something for my wounds but i'm always dying from not treating it.			"

								It's like Rust and DayZ combined with a little bit of Far Cry thrown in. I love it. The learning curve is a bit steep but once you  learn the basics you'll be Building bases and robbing people in no time. For an early access survival game I'd say it's one of the better ones. I'd recommend playing with a group of people though. The Russian seem to hate the Americans so watch out for them in-game. Now get to killing some bandits and dogs!!!			"

								 The game in its current state seems broke. My first few hours in the starting area was fun. Killing people on sight taking what they have and moving further along. The problem is it turns into a ""press e to open box"" simulator. Your progress ultimatley gets stopped because your spending all your time running from kitchen to kitchen opening cabinents trying to stay alive and keep your items. Ultimatley you die of dehydration/hunger because out of 20 kitchens with about 6 cabinets each to open you find NOTHING. It seems the game is rigged to offer you less drops the further along you get opening 100's of cabinets and finding squat. Wait until they patch or finish the product. current patch 8.6.8 alphaTLDR : (6/10 drop rates keeps your progress halted)			"

								This game would be decent, but unfortunately it is dead. I certainly like the idea, but Unity is a very clunky engine. I feel like if this game had more players, it would be a lot more fun. As of now, only about 2-3 people in each server. I will recommend this game because it is decent but is dead. The devs really need to work on this, it will bring more of a community and a lot less refunds. I would personally like to work on this game, make it better, the devs, unfortunately are inactive and I see why. There is no community that will like the game regardless. This game honestly has had just a bad start.			"

								For 5.99 you can get a great experiance in a post apocolyptic world. Honestly this game is worth every penny. It could even be put up against DayZ.One thing I wish I knew before buying this game is that it is Linear. You work your way through a map of multiple areas. Each new area having a different enviornment and different loot. Some areas will be filled with weapons and ammo. While others are filled with Food and Water. Some areas can be unforgiving lacking in food or weapons to defend yourself.Like any survival game it's always good to have a friend with you. So i'd recommed you grab a buddy and explore this world. Plus for this game being so under priced why not.In summary this game is worth trying.A great introduction into the survival game genre without dropping a $30 price tag. It's built quite well and I did not run in to any serious glitches.			"

								I bought this game like 4 weeks ago. I played this game about 2 and half hours and after that I was more sad then happy. I was stuck in one area because when I went to the next area I had a black screen. It was pretty annoying. I checked last update and there was no hope. But now the develop came from hades. They are saying that update is coming this month. So guys if you think about this game, just wait for new update and than you will see, because at this point the game is very buggy. Otherwise If develop fix a massive bugs in this game I will recommend it for you. So just wait and look for updates :)			"

								For the price you pay for this, it's well worth it! I had some fun and got frustrated at times, but it has so much potential to be a great game, possibly better than DayZ!Some of my experience so far:- Spawned naked- Ran to nearby house- Looted some cookies and beer (nice) - Found a shirt and some bi*chin' shorts- Found a hat- Found a gun and bullets- Came across an abandoned apartment building and started looting- Hear footsteps coming up the stairs, so I draw my pistol and hide behind a table (perfect spot)- Guy runs in towards me wielding an axe wearing better shorts than me- I start furiously clicking to try and shoot him, only to find my gun wasn't loaded, and for him recieving a volley of clicks.- He strikes me twice, I let out a blood-curdling scream, then die.- Then as I gaze down upon my precious collection of cookies, beer, a gun and other items, I can't help but feel a little bit sad- He took my gun, beer, and my damn cookies...So that was my first experience, but I can say I'm quite impressed from what I saw. This game has a lot of potential and I am glad I contributed towards it. I just hope the developers won't abandon what could be an excellent game.			"

								Now.... I will just talk about it a little bit. I've played this game for a while, on another account, and i'm just here to tell you about the game.For this game's price, it's one of the best damn games i've seen. They have been working way harder to make their game better. DayZ has been in EA for 2-3 years, and coming out with updates nearly every month. This game has been out for nearly a year now, and it seems to be going on alot better then DayZ. While this game dosen't even compare to survival games like Ark, as I said before, it's price is alot better. The graphics are decent, and it takes very little computing power to actually run, also compared to ARK, which takes a very decent computer to run.All in all, it's a good game with a good price, what else would you want?

								For 5 euro you can't lose. Bought this game with low expectations but enjoy the game very much. I played some DayZ before but i stopped playing it because the optimisation was terrible. I honostly rather pay the amount of money i spend on DayZ to this game than to DayZ itself. The game itself runs smooth, obtaining weapons isnt hard. And most of all no lagging through walls AI. Bad thing i think is the map. It isnt one big map, but devided in sectors. Maybe thats also a good thing because it saves you a hell load of ping drops.I'm too lazy to write down all the pros and cons.Overall this game is good, and for 5 euros you can have  a great time.

								It's sad, because it is a great game. It's the lack of care the Developer has that ruins it. Nothing but hack, more hacks, and then a little bit of hacks. If that's not enough the allowence of players to build walls just to troll the servers so noone can get loot, is just another example of the developer not giving a flying rats butt hole.Other wise it's a great game, well thought out, lots fo replay if those nasty elements I described would just get handled. I fact, the only latest news is the concern that players got banned???? REally ? No crap there is nothing but hackers galore in this game. And you want to care about the banned players?

								“Our game is almost in a finished state""This game is far from a finished state, more like 20% percent finished.constant warping and server disconnects,no key-bind option.no way to melee attack when first spawning in to defend  yourself.5 different buttons to activate player menu.no mic function even though people claim viop is in the game.graphic settings is done through percent.  20%  50% 75% and so forth.this Game is pretty much lacking anything that could be a survival game.crafting is near to none, no way to even craft.I would not recommend this game to anyone,2 years in development under the unity engine and they've only got about 20% of game playable.

								The game is stable for what it is but has a few issues. If you enjoy survival games but you don't have a high end PC, this is the game for you. But if your looking for a survival game that looks good AND runs well without the issues this one has I suggest you buy another game. That being said it can be enjoyed for many hours. I have a few complaints. Fix the animal animations and the AI. Fix the constant loss of health for no reason. (i assume it's from the cold but there is no way to get warm at the moment, at least none that i can find and the fire doesn't help) And last but not least, PLEASE change the UI it can be annoying at times. 7/10 for now...

								So... the game is NOT totally dead like everyone wants to say. I have not encountered any hackers in my playtime. I have encountered several bugs but no crashes. There isn't a whole lot to do, but it is kinda fun if you aren't looking for anything complex. Graphics are okay and sounds are okay. Only NPC I've come across is a dog/wolf. Loot is fairly easy to find but ammo is another thing. I can find tons and tons of ammo but none that work with any weapons that I've found and I've found like 5 or 6 different types of guns. No guns spawn with ammo in them so that is annoying. I've encountered quite a few players and out of all of them (around 15 or so I would say) I was only attacked by 3 of them. I dropped 2 of them, and the other one got me. The map seems fairly large but I have been to the same building like 3 times since when you die, you respawn in the same general area so I kept running by the same stuff. There is no hud, and only a dot crosshair.Decent game for $2.50EDIT: I've now encountered one person who I truly believe was hacking. While I have no proof, I think he was hacking for the amount of ammo he had and the fact that he wouldn't die despite being shot multiple times and once in the head. He went fully automatic on a couple of guys and had to fire about 3 mags. Then he saw me and did the same thing with about 2 mags. I played for quite a few hours and couldnt gather more than about 20 rounds for a weapon type at a time. I even went to the military base but found not a lot.			"

								Well as of this point I have only played the game for 2 hours. It is very basic. You start with nothing, and need to find a weapon, you can not punch or kick to try and defend yourself against those that would do you harm, which seems to be every player and animal (so far only wolfs/dogs seen). I spent only like $2.74 or $3.74 CDN on this so I got my entertainment from it. Its not a great game, but it did amuse me a bit. I made and posted a short video of the game here:

I was able to use some items and most of the item the first item was picked and I could not anything then cant drop items, cant use items.. cant do anything-The whole houses look pretty much the same, totally easy build... bad designer "

								Survival: Postapocalypse Now is great to play with friends and a great pass time game. Although... There are the downsides. A problem I've encountered many times now is being randomly ""teleported"" to a random area in the location. And i'm not the only one who has encountered this. Another major problem is the framerate. They need to fix this in the Hospital location especially seeing that I cannot turn around without my game stalling or dropping framerate. My specs are displayed in my profile description. I've also found that the game doesn't explain things very well. I spent at least an hour making sense of how the guns work and how the ammunition works. But I suppose that's just me seeing I don't have much experience with guns and how they work. Overall though, this game has potential. Besides the few bugs and glitches it's a very well made game for an Early Access title. I recommend this game if you are into Survival games and Russians especially, but at it's current state, I would wait for an update to fix those few major problems.			"

								So far ive enjoyed playing the game. There are a few problems though.You dont spawn with any weapon or the ability to punch. So you are defenseless untill you find a weapon which brings on the next problem.Finding Items is difficult. I played for over 3 hours and only found one juice box to hydrate myself. I was dying of dehydration before a dog killed me. YES, DOGS!There are tons of dogs/wolves who are agressive. They can attack you even though you dont have the ability to fight back until you find a weapon. So new spawns pretty much get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥until you find a gun.Player encounters are NOT rare. you will see another player every 10 minutes. Most of the time the other players will shoot on sight. No mercy for new spanws.Another strange thing is there is no options menu. no ability to adjust music or sound effect volume. Also no real video options. Only ability to set overal quality.I reccomend getting the game now thats its cheap and waiting for future developement. So far the game is easily worth its $5To the devs: PLEASE add hand combat. New spawns need a way to defend themselves.			"

Dayz took 2 years to get vehicles, this game needs a month to have that and even more.Suggestions:Worktool inventory section. [Line in inventory specified for worktools] (Cuz right now it sucks to pick 2 mele weapons only cuz u need to work with wood and not be able to have a gun)Adding Lynx. [Game needs cats too](A wild and fast animal with attackstyle of a predator, this cats launch position might be from a tree)Furniture crafting,baricadeing,window and door creation. [Lets builda a snowman](Right now makeing a cabin is pointless adding these things, might make it useful)Dog folowers. [Just an insane dream probbably not gona happen](Dogs could be good folowers in this game, like people could use dogs to trace food or enemies, or if the dog is trained enough it could be used for weapon or amunation searching)Weapon skin system. [Skins could not be lost](I have noticed that people like to play games where they can earn money, this game could have similar system to csgo.It could be optimized like haveing ""Supply drop cases"" which couldb be only opened by  ""Supply Keys"" which would cost money.That would give you cash to improve the game more and players would earn money by selling skins or lose some money by purchaseing them.)Waiting for more updates, and hopefully waiting for your decision on my ideas.

 IntroductionThis is a very interesting game, even though the developers are Russian, I am actually surprised this game is fun. However there is a downside to this game. Everyone who I have come across has CS aim. Don't know what CS aim is? No matter, the following paragraph will explain. After the first paragraph, I will talk about the game and a potential scenario you may find yourself in. What is CS aim? CS aim is referred to as Counter Strike aim, yes the game we all know and love. Basically everyone who shoots at you is probably a Global Elite; I say this because every battle I have been involved in always ends up with me being outplayed beyond, literally. I may be sitting in a bush (lots of foliage around me, basically impossible to see me) and people will locate my exact coordinate and fire at me, whenever I move, they will keep shooting without missing. So in conclusion CS aim is just the theory of someone never missing a shot no matter the situation. The GameThe game overall is actually quite fun, you will find yourself with a gun (eventually) and some ammo, and when you have this almost instantly you will hear footsteps, loud footsteps. Your heart will race and you will try to outsmart whoever this is, but always remember my theory, CS aim. You use your knowledge of the CS aim philosophy, so you camp it out a bit waiting for the person to appear before you, and when they do, you shoot, only to find out you didn't load the gun. The person is now identified as a white male, Russian ex Spetsnaz Praposhchik. The man drops to the ground and lights you up within a heartbeat... Now you wait 59 seconds to respawn. Conclusion 11/10 would play smart against ex Spetsnaz Praposhchik and forget to load my gun. gg			"

The water is also HORRID. It's super flashy and glitchy. I almost had to put on sunglasses just to play.			"

								Ok, first of all, there is a reason why this game is $5 (You get what you pay for). Now, for the game it's self, it's a cheap DayZ knock-off. Now, just because it's a knock-off doesn't mean it can't be good, However this game is awful. The game starts you in a tutorial (I think, since you never return when you die) The Tutorial is dark and doesnt tell you where to go or what to do (So, you'll be wandering for 5-10 mins) after the ""Tutorial"" it drops you in a sewer (Where you do re-spawn!) Now that your in the game, it's time for some real fun? No, only suffering awaits...... When your in te Sewer there is 0 lights and 0 direction (So quickly it becomes the story of a Russian man who goes crazy in a Sewer). After spending (Easily) 30mins- 1 hour, you'll begin the actual game. it drops you off, the (Obviously) you look for supplies (Since your a shirtless Russian man.) Strangley however, very close to spawn is a weapon/ammo spawn and, it's just terrible. I got 2 Mags for a Rifle and Suicidal thoughts. Now, Skiping over a lot of me running around looking for a shirt, I walked into some sort of diner (Maybe?), I was looting it, until I heard footsteps. A man in a Russian steel helmet with UN markings came out of nowhere, and (With the Revolver I found while wandering) I shot him 3 times. While looting him I took his helmet, gas mask, meat and Track suit (So I can be like true Slav.) Further down the road I found a Army base, this Army base was more of a ""Army base"" than I expected. I rolled up, and there were no zombies, however there were a family of (Quite) nasty wolfs. Little did I know this'd be a re-occuring theme. After shooting the dogs I found a AK-47 (Although it seemed larger than normal.) I couldn't find ammo anywhere (Also, never finding any ammo in the army base.) Around this time I realized that people could set down structures (The reason I know is because they were placed EVERYWHERE in the army base.) It was a appaling to see these towering walls of trashy wood covering sections of tents. After leaving the army base, I peiced it together that the threats in this game are Wolves, Players and Bears (If there are zombies in this game they played such a little role I cant remember them.) The rest of my game time was spent walking aimlessly through a swamp, cursed to never find my way out (Until I was mauled by Ninja Bear.)In Conclusion: Do you recommend this game?: No.Is this game fun?: No.Is there a reason to buy this game?: Yes! As a joke gift.Is it worth the $1.49 (That it costs on steam now?): Unless it's a joke gift.Would you recommend this game?: ...... (Did you even read this ♥♥♥♥ing Reveiw?!?!)What Experiences does this game provide?: The Suicidal kind.....($1.49 is too much, hell F2P is too much)       -10/10 Would wish for the sweet relief of death again -Wespen			"

								Feels alot like 7D2D did in the beginning. I personally dont hate the game but think it needed a hell of a lot more work before being made anywhere near public.Pros; good looting, good gun mechanics, weather effects for such low system requirements were pretty nice. Cons; no tutorial?, wolves/dogs run thru doors and with no melee ur kinda screwed very quickly and ... rest of game lol Conclusion; for $5 not half bad but IRL feels like lol DayZ Standalone for♥♥♥♥♥♥PCs :D			"

								It's better than most of the games out there for $5, but it's still not worth it.The keyboard controls cannot be changed. They are what they are. This is what I hated the most. Also if you have an axe, hammer, or whatever you can't use your pistol unless you drop it. You can only switch between your primary and melee weapon if you have a melee weapon. If you have no melee weapon you are free to use primary and secondary weapons, but for whatever reason melee weapon takes over for your secondary weapon.Other players are lagging all over the place which makes it very hard to kill hostile players warping all over around me... I've killed 2 players in 2 hours. Could have killed a 3rd... Shot him in the face twice with a shotgun then I think he quit. All you have to do is hit ESC to exit a server instantly. Easy to combat dodge and Server hop for loot. The only thing that takes a minute is respawning after a death which makes you wait 1 minute. So I can combat dodge and server hop easily for loot but I can't respawn instantly. Makes so much sense! Also I can see where all the other players are on the server while I'm dead! GHOSTING ANYONE!? Anyway...I've only been killed by wolves or freezing to death... The community can't seem to aim or I'm just as laggy for them as they are for me. So back to freezing. You need an axe to get the wood, lighter fluid to put on the wood, and a lighter. Most lighters have 6% fluid in them that I have found and that is not enough to light the wood. I will usually have wood and lighter fluid and no lighter or i have a lighter and lighter fluid and can't find an axe and I freeze to death. The community is lame and annoying in VOIP... You can look at bushes with your crosshair to see if a person's name shows up so you know if someone is trying to hide where you can't see.I like the inventory system. All items take up 1 slot, you start out with 8 and a backpack only adds another 8 slots for a total of 16 slots. Meds are really hard to find and you can't combine anything together except for ammo. So I will have a lighter, lighter fluid, wood, 2 cans of food, can opener, 2 or 3 bottles of water, primary and secondary ammo, all the meds i can find, and still have room for more. You can't put weapons in your backpack for a buddy like in DayZ, but whatever...There is a map but no compass in game, but the map shows your general location. It's a small location compared to other survival games.Overall the game is just alright. I don't understand this mostly positive score. These people must have only played games in the 90s because this game has about that level of detail. The gameplay feels more modern but needs a lot more work. I've never played Rust, but I'm going to go ahead and recommend a game I've never played for an extra $15 cause this is the internet you all do whatever someone tells you to do on the internet.RESPECT MAH AUTHORITEH AND BUY RUST CAUSE I SAID TO!!!Or you can just save your $5 for the next big thing... It's up to you. It's your money and you are in control.			"

								This game is Great. Super Fun game to play with your friends! Its the Cheap DayZ. Super Intense, very little glitches. Overall  its a great game.It is Early Access, obviously some changes need to be made but its great.Some glitches i did notice are: The melee, sometimes i'm hitting a dog with the Axe but its not dieing. When on a fire place, i drop down a piece of Meat and it cooks, i pick it up but on my friends screen its still there, which means they Duplicate. (not even mad) The loot on your screen isn't the same on other screens. Sometimes when im cold and i need a fire. I make it but i don't warm up. I have to run away 10ft and come back so it'll work in some houses i walk around the house and there is sections where i can hear the outside and it sounds like im walking outside. I noticed that after these new updates the water looks EXTREMELY GlitchyThats just some that i can think of right now.If a Dev is reading this please add 3rd PERSON! <3and also you should add bones so we can make Doggie Friends an Hunt the others down!!!10/10 "

								I have played around 17 hours on this game. I do not recommend if you are new to gaming, new to computer gaming or do not like being killed alot. Seriously. This game had potential, but the second someone else sees you on the game, they kill you. They run in packs to protect themselves, so if you dont have a group that is armed and carrying good gear, do not expect to get ANYWHERE in this game. Items are just impossible in this game. Either you find food but no drinks or ammo and no guns or clothes and nothing else or some rediculous combination. If it isnt the people that get you, it is the cold or the bears or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed dogs. Cannot find melee weapons for♥♥♥♥♥♥either. too dark to see♥♥♥♥♥♥at night, can never find flashlights and batteries and even if you do, you run  the risk of others seeing you, so again....dead.If people quit being♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and let you be, you might get somewhere in this game, but no, they kill you to scavenge what measley stuff you find.

								*This is already better than of what RUST or DAYZ standalone has become. Like seriously, those games are dead. PROS:+ A lot of action+ Not grindy+ Works smoothly on hi graphics with medium pc.+ Combat is much better than in look-a-likes (rust).+ Enviroment feels alive+ Hunger/thirst/temperature are there to create survivalish feeling. Not to annoy you, and not to be ignored forever. +Lots of loot, alive combat (magazines, rounds, weapon conditions)+ Very nice post-apocalyptic enviroment.CONS:-Full of russians. (the ones that completely ignore the fact that english is worldwide lang).-Crafting is messy and unclear o.O-NO DOORS. Again, no doors. Like, you cant have a base YET.-NPC enemies are buggy for the moment.-Weapons condition might be changing too frequently.-Instad of one-open-world there are these 'zones' that you pass. Map is divided into the zones. Loading screen each time u enter a new zone. Annoying as f**k.Overall: 7/10.   After they add doors ill give this game 8/10. Still needs some polishing, but i'd say i would buy this game for 15$ anyway. AFTER THEY ADD FREAKING DOORS -.-			"

								Best $5 ive ever spent, this game is actually better than dayz and H1Z1 at the moment, they have way more guns than dayz, more realistic loot style than dayz and H1Z1 and this game is actually challenging. Ive only found 1 minor bug, sometimes you get stuck and have to log and run or kill your self. They have developed a way of surpression by blurring and making your screen go red which is actually effective. They have created a realistic style of manipulating your weapon and challenge you to mind a magazine and ammo not only ammo. The environment is most hostile i have come across, not rust, dayz or Reign of kings can even compare, almost everyone is out to kill you, mainly russians.10/10 WOULD CAMP IN A WAREHOUSE WITH A SAIGA AND YELL ""WOLVERINES"" WHILE MOWING DOWN ROUGHLY 12 PEOPLE.

								This game is very intresting... I will start with some pros and list some cons. Please be aware this is a brief review and doesn't go over the whole game. Pros: -Pretty cheap being 5 dollars, good price for it atm. -OK variety of weapons-People don't always Kill on Sight (Of course this might change if this game becomes more popular)-Not a usual ""apocalypse"" survival game, instead of zombies or mutants it has real animals such as bears and wolves.-You can go into most buildings-Food, Liquid, and Temperature system, runs somewhat sturdy except at times you can freeze to death quite easy without gasoline or an axe.Cons: -The map is extremely confusing-There are different ""sections"" of the entire map-Bears are OP and can usually one hit you-Most clothing does not provide any buffs and doesn't help warmth but is just for looks.-There are only around 2-3 types of rifle weapons atm, and there should be more.-Graphics are ok.-Hard to find other players at times.-Early Access.This is my review, but if you really want to know what the game is like, go ahead and get it. It is worth it if you do decide to get it, trust me, it's worth the five dollars. And that's about it.			"

								+Cheap, and good for the price- needs more features, more of everything, and more places to loot, also it would be fun if every server had different terrain.If you are not in a group you will get rekt by an armed person right after you spawn in your underwear.How this game is: play in a lowly populated server, get loot, get weapons, walk arround, and just survive m8, it`s ok to play liek this.Or you can:Get okay weapons, go to the army base in a highly populated server, camp in a tower, take fire from 4 directions, including the ground. Die. Rage. Go back and try to take up ur loot in just your underwear. DIe. repeat 20 times, then you find 20 corpses on the ground, no one close, so you can loot them, saves you arround 4 hours in game.			"

								Ok lets see. I played the game several hours now and the more i play, the less fun it makes. But i will make a pro/ contra list, so see for yourself.Pro:-For an Early Alpha Version it works pretty well. Stable ingame, sometimes hanging up upon switching between parts of the map, but all in all pretty smooth-5 Euro is really cheap, so if you dont like it, you dont waste much moneyThats it for the real pros...Contra:Environment:- Snow everwhere...exept for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ marsh...else snow, snow, snow- the same 5 houses, with the exact same inventory everywhere, exept for a school, a church and an industiral complex- only 2 npc enemies, wolves and bears randomly spawning, even right after start where you just run for your life- a really bad and small inventory...if you arent lucky to get a bag sometime, you are just running around with 8 slots...gg- if you pick up a handgun and an axe, you can switch between them...then you pick up an shotgun and can switch between axe and shotgun, but to choose your handgun you have to drop axe or shotgun...and if you want to carry axe and hammer, to build something, you cant carry a big gun to defend yourself..gg- First half of the game is farming food n weapons in the first 2 villages...farm them, switch server to reset the villages and the loot, farm again. Then you can either go through an endless pretty empty marsh, swimming through icewater, so make a fire every 5 metre, or get 2 hit killed by a bear.Or you got lucky and get fuel for an engine in a bunker to use an elevator to get through...what will happen like 1 of 1000 times.BUT...you will rarely get that far. You waste an hour looting houses, just to get shot by anyone spotting you. I dont know what kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ play this game, but they dont get the survival part...working together or so...nah...kill anything moving, to steal his loot. You could beg for mercy, but 95% of the players are russians who dont speak english and even if they understand you, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥.So its just, loot, die, restart at 0....again and again and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥IT AGAIN.So better spend 20 Euro more for a better survival game, like the forest.Update:Another great job...now they added an prison as starlocation....so you waste 10 minutes running through an empty building with 5000 doors, finding no loot at all...at least nothing useful, like ammo for the imaginary gun you received yet or a portable radio without batteries.And after you managed to get out there, some russian ret.ards just sit outside waiting for some unarmed guy to show up, just to instantly kill you. Good Job, now the game is completly unplayable, since you always! (yes i tried it on 13 servers now, everytime, killed after prison) die by those no life inc.est bas♥♥♥♥♥♥♥I want my money back! Now!			"

								You start out with nothing... and cannot even use your fists. Poor design in my opinion for a survival game not being able to punch anyone. So new spawns don't have a♥♥♥♥♥♥chance at anything. Gun/ammo spawns are just as annoying as DAYZ, only without being able to punch you get ♥♥♥♥ed pretty fast. No item quickbar, and can only hold 1 weapon at a time. Very clunky and honestly not even worth $5 yet.			"

								Edit: While I still find the game enjoyable, there are some glaring bugs that are beginning to surface. Such as how there is a random chance that when you phase into a new area that the game will completely freeze. You can hear your guy jumping around and moving, but it just sits at the ""Connect to Server"" screen. Myself, and a couple of my friends have experienced this same error and it can be super annoying (especially when playing together).For $5 I have had more fun in this game than most $50-60 game. It is surprisingly polished for the price, but at the same time it is obvious there is a lot of room for improvement. I would consider this a much more simplified, fast paced,  version of Rust. I think the main thing that needs to be worked on at this point is the inventory management. It could definitely use some improvement.			"

I found an abandoned building and 3 dogs killed me within 5 seconds because I'm carrying a gun with no ammo and I can't use my fists... lol.There's also a strange glitch where if you pick up multiple items close together and your bags are almost full, you will pick them up but not have them in your inventory, so they will essentially disappear.

								Hello,The Full Controller Support that was implemented into the game doesn't work and hopefully will be fixed soon, because I like many like to play games in a more relaxed state generally, and keyboard and mouse just doesnt work anymore, unless you are a programmer or super-GEEK! The thermal update to use clothes as well as other items is a BIG+ as in to not have to worry about dying so quickly searching for the other rare items to find that would help you with thermal protection. HEALTH !, as in there needs to be a way or more items in areas to keep you from dying from lack of good health including lowering the amount of dogs in an area would greatly help.  Ammo needs to be close by that actually works with the gun and descent amount when you pick up a gun, gas container for vehicles of all types as well as generators or machinery needs to be in more areas, and the constant putting you in the swamp when you are more then two areas ahead of it, needs to be fixed as in not fair to always spawn that far back from where you died, as well as a driveable boat or two needs to be put in the swamp, pre-fabricated traps (e.g. bear trap) and the ability to make a trap (e.g. nature tarp with spiked pit below) needs to be added into the game. Last but not least for now scuba diving gear for fun and finding items under water would be a nice new added feature. In closing thanks for listening to your customers and future customers of this great potential game that I believe will be the best survival and then some type of game in a long time when it's finally completed or completed enough for a final release that I'm sure will have updates even then ;)                                                                                                                                                        Sincerely  ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з=( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿                                                                                                                                                                             a fan of STEAM™  "

								Edit: While I still find the game enjoyable, there are some glaring bugs that are beginning to surface. Such as how there is a random chance that when you phase into a new area that the game will completely freeze. You can hear your guy jumping around and moving, but it just sits at the ""Connect to Server"" screen. Myself, and a couple of my friends have experienced this same error and it can be super annoying (especially when playing together).For $5 I have had more fun in this game than most $50-60 game. It is surprisingly polished for the price, but at the same time it is obvious there is a lot of room for improvement. I would consider this a much more simplified, fast paced,  version of Rust. I think the main thing that needs to be worked on at this point is the inventory management. It could definitely use some improvement.			"

								This is definitely a must try for those who love a good atmospheric adventure/survival against nature. This game is based around Russia where snow and rain is very common in its cold climate. No zombies, no bs super powers, pure survival pvp/pve in a Russian-like world with plenty to explore. For 5$ you couldn't go wrong. Plus, it runs super smooth and has VERY LITTLE BUGS!!! Give it a try!			"

								This game is really fun to laugh and play around with. It is not something to seriously sit down and play for a long time. Dogs are the number 1 killer. I found an abandoned building and 3 dogs killed me within 5 seconds because I'm carrying a gun with no ammo and I can't use my fists... lol.There's also a strange glitch where if you pick up multiple items close together and your bags are almost full, you will pick them up but not have them in your inventory, so they will essentially disappear.

								Hello,The Full Controller Support that was implemented into the game doesn't work and hopefully will be fixed soon, because I like many like to play games in a more relaxed state generally, and keyboard and mouse just doesnt work anymore, unless you are a programmer or super-GEEK! The thermal update to use clothes as well as other items is a BIG+ as in to not have to worry about dying so quickly searching for the other rare items to find that would help you with thermal protection. HEALTH !, as in there needs to be a way or more items in areas to keep you from dying from lack of good health including lowering the amount of dogs in an area would greatly help.  Ammo needs to be close by that actually works with the gun and descent amount when you pick up a gun, gas container for vehicles of all types as well as generators or machinery needs to be in more areas, and the constant putting you in the swamp when you are more then two areas ahead of it, needs to be fixed as in not fair to always spawn that far back from where you died, as well as a driveable boat or two needs to be put in the swamp, pre-fabricated traps (e.g. bear trap) and the ability to make a trap (e.g. nature tarp with spiked pit below) needs to be added into the game. Last but not least for now scuba diving gear for fun and finding items under water would be a nice new added feature. In closing thanks for listening to your customers and future customers of this great potential game that I believe will be the best survival and then some type of game in a long time when it's finally completed or completed enough for a final release that I'm sure will have updates even then ;)                                                                                                                                                        Sincerely  ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з=( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿                                                                                                                                                                             a fan of STEAM™  "

								It's quite entertaining, for 5 bucks way better than i would have expected. I know this is alpha, and so I feel like really that bad things are important here for the effort of fixing them.1. The effect on the water, Literaly makes me nauseous, I'd honestly rather play not even being able to see the water just so i don't have to worry about running into it. In fact it actually makes playing difficutl and have to cut out regularly. (its the wavy effect on the water, its awful, the reflection is fine, just the movement turn it off? or i don't even know what to suggest, I wouldn't be surprised to find other folks that have this happen).2. Is there an armor value to items? i whack a guy with an axe 5 times, he's fine, he turns around and shoots me and i die? This isn't the first time, the first time, i shot a guy with 4 shots from a shot gun center mass, and then he shoots me with a nine 3 times and i die,... not really motivating. I play shooters, im not concerned about my aim, not to mention the little blood spurt from the guy your hitting, it's pretty obvious when your connecting.3. I come on to play, make it through an entire zone, when i load into the next zone, i get killed by apparently nothing and get the jarred kitty folks seem to have mentioned. 4. I don't get the point of building, no one seems to use it for anything except to keep new players out of houses to loot for stuff, OR, once i zoned into a section, they build a house at the zone area with no doors, so i was stuck inside and had to suicide out since i didn't have an axe. The only purpose building seems to serve, is to screw with new players, nobody does anything funcional with it, and considering i've been half way across the map before, it seems to only be a useful mechanic if your an @##&0l3. Turn it off? Also should probably make foundations destructible, for that reason since they don't seem to break.			"

								This game is amazingly fun but here are my ideas to make it better...ZOMBIES: Dont make dogs the only threat in a survival game. If not zombies add some other things.Weapons: Make weapons slightly more common.Water: Fix water texturesMenus: DONT MAKE ESCAPE ALWAYS QUIT YOU FROM THE GAME!!!!!  If I am in my inventory and  I press escape, just make it close the inventory, but if I press it with no menu open have it log me out. (MOST IMPORTANT ONE ON THIS LIST)Food: Make food easier to find.			"

								I think this is a great game, i admit it has some issues though, i have no idea how to stop randomly getting hurt and before i know it iv'e died of some strange disease or whatever (advice would be helpful) but it handles the survival genre alot better than most other high rated games which i find a little too much to handle. In short for £3.99 you get a fair amount of fun and suspense for what you pay, 8/10, i will be buying the full release when available.			"

								At £4.99 this game is what you should expect for such a low price tag. They say the objective is to survive, but it's nothing more than a fairly small deathmatch arena, spread across a few small, lightly populated zones, each as bleak and barren as the next. You spawn in, you try and find guns and ammo raking through draw after draw and cupboard after cupboard, if you don't get ganked doing that then it's time for you to go do the ganking until your ammo runs out or you die, then repeat.I'm not sure what I was expecting, not alot because it's so cheap, but it's not my cup of tea, as they say! Theres no purpose, just a really old looking fps with very very light survival aspects, including a hunger meter that goes down ridiculously quickly and a building system with zero purpose at all.Not recommended, it's not bad, it's just not worth anybody's time lol.

								WTH is going on here? That bear sounded like it was tearing through dimensions. Still better than H1Z1 at launch. Is it worth $5? Im still not sure. But Im going to keep playing it and say yes for now. Kind of. As long as you dont mind that nothing works and if there is one person on a server they have all of the weapons, can find you very fast, and just KOS you.Seriously, even in Early Access you need to be able to use the items taht you find. Out of all of the spawns Ive played now only one actually allowed me to select an item in my inventory. Allof the other times it was stuck on the same slot. So I couldnt select the food or water that I found to remedy my condition.Player who kept killing me was actually facing the wrong way when he shot and killed me (180 degrees the wrong way) and he was able to float across the whole map. Seems legit.Ive played worse Early Access games but not many this bad. But its under $5. You dont even get a shirt for that. Im serious. You dont get a shirt.			"

Its £3.CONS:Community, its questionable, if you dont have a mic, your ♥♥♥♥ed, This brings me tp the next con!Theres no chat menu, therefor if you have no mic, you can't say your friendly or communicate!Thats it, This game is icnredible for what it is, Buy it whilst you can, price may vary up and down!So yeah, jsut buy it, right now, im waiting.Still waiting.

Well, that dream has come true. This game puts the Deathmatch/Team Deathmatch game in an open world like DayZ. Where you need to collect items and get hungry and cold and stuff. In this game, you don't have to have any guilt when killing players because it's deathmatch. You can kill hundreds of players without doing anything wrong. I've played it 18 hours so far and I've really enjoy it. It's only 5$ and its really worth it.Best 5$ I ever spent!			"

								I give this game 10/10!!!  I've been a fan of the survival games since the DayZ Mod came out for Arma II.  This is now one of my favorite games to currently play (I play DayZ, H1Z1, and Miscreated)!  This is a great game to play with friends (the cost makes it an awesome game to buy for other people) or you can play it solo and ""hope"" to meet some random battle buddy.  Some of my best gameplay has been teaming with some random guy or girl that I meet in game.  RIP all my lost Random Battle Buddys.... :(If you approach this game with an open mind and a sense of humor, you will NOT be disappointed! :D   This game will provide hours of laughs, suspense, and the occasional heartache.  xDI highly recommend this game!

								The game is completely worth the money!It's like a mix of DayZ with Rust and Unturned!!Pros:-Graphics are really good-Runs smoothly on almost any computerCons:-Not to may options when it comes to mouse sensivity,audio,etc.-Spectate option (which is pretty broken when the guy u kill has a few friends on skype to who he can tell what u are doing so they can kill you :( Done that XD)			"

								The game is nice! Here are some points that would really be nice in the game:1: Crafting a bow and arrows2: Locking the bases3: Storage in the bases at least for food, wood & stuff (not for weapons)4. Changing between primary, secondary weapon even when you have an axe AND a hammer5. Crafting some more stuff as bandages would be good, because healing is a bit too hard in the game right now.i like the game and looking forward to the stuff the devs will implement in the future			"

								This is definitely a must try for those who love a good atmospheric adventure/survival against nature. This game is based around Russia where snow and rain is very common in its cold climate. No zombies, no bs super powers, pure survival pvp/pve in a Russian-like world with plenty to explore. For 5$ you couldn't go wrong. Plus, it runs super smooth and has VERY LITTLE BUGS!!! Give it a try!			"

								This game is really fun to laugh and play around with. It is not something to seriously sit down and play for a long time. Dogs are the number 1 killer. I found an abandoned building and 3 dogs killed me within 5 seconds because I'm carrying a gun with no ammo and I can't use my fists... lol.There's also a strange glitch where if you pick up multiple items close together and your bags are almost full, you will pick them up but not have them in your inventory, so they will essentially disappear.

								Hello,The Full Controller Support that was implemented into the game doesn't work and hopefully will be fixed soon, because I like many like to play games in a more relaxed state generally, and keyboard and mouse just doesnt work anymore, unless you are a programmer or super-GEEK! The thermal update to use clothes as well as other items is a BIG+ as in to not have to worry about dying so quickly searching for the other rare items to find that would help you with thermal protection. HEALTH !, as in there needs to be a way or more items in areas to keep you from dying from lack of good health including lowering the amount of dogs in an area would greatly help.  Ammo needs to be close by that actually works with the gun and descent amount when you pick up a gun, gas container for vehicles of all types as well as generators or machinery needs to be in more areas, and the constant putting you in the swamp when you are more then two areas ahead of it, needs to be fixed as in not fair to always spawn that far back from where you died, as well as a driveable boat or two needs to be put in the swamp, pre-fabricated traps (e.g. bear trap) and the ability to make a trap (e.g. nature tarp with spiked pit below) needs to be added into the game. Last but not least for now scuba diving gear for fun and finding items under water would be a nice new added feature. In closing thanks for listening to your customers and future customers of this great potential game that I believe will be the best survival and then some type of game in a long time when it's finally completed or completed enough for a final release that I'm sure will have updates even then ;)                                                                                                                                                        Sincerely  ̿'̿'\̵͇̿̿\з=( ͠° ͟ʖ ͡°)=ε/̵͇̿̿/'̿̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿ ̿                                                                                                                                                                             a fan of STEAM™  "

								SURVIVAL: POSTAPOCALYPSE NOW DIARYGot in the game, found a dog, got killed because I was too much of a pansy to use my fists.Respawned, found some guy looting the building, said hi, didn't respond, I got shot in the back by some other guy.Several hours later, I've finally got some good gear. I've got my backpack, clothes, shotgun, plenty of ammo and an axe. I was looting a church-like place when I saw a guy in there. Told him to keep calm and that I had no intention of shooting him. He looked at me, stepped closer, bashed me in the face with a hammer. I blew his brain to bits. I bled for about 20-25 minutes, going through town to town while looking for some medicine. After 6 diffrent towns, I came up with nothing. Spent my last five minutes jacking off into the mostly abandoned lands of Siberia.			"

								My opinion - better than DayZ in many ways, but DayZ is for a bit more ""hardcore"" survival players. This is more casual. I started to play this game, didn't know squat about it. 4 hours in - me and my buddy are armed to the teeth and exploring the map. Making nice camp fires, roasting wolf meat and talking about those nice times when we had a car and were driving around (sadly some glitch took it away). We cleaned our weapons and eat some sardines (not only they feed you, you can satisfy your thirst from them - they are the best), added a nice red dot mod for my assault shotgun and onwards we went. If I had to say it to you the easy way - this is going to be something like DayZ + Rust (but without zombies). You roam around and scavange for resources, but you can chop down the trees, craft items together and make your own little base building. Will see how it develops, it was really fun and really interesting for the first 4 hours, will play some more when I get the time. If you have to ask me - at this moment, for 5 euros - depends on what you want. I bought it and I am happy with my purchase. I am sure that I will sink many many more hours into it.			"

								At £4.99 this game is what you should expect for such a low price tag. They say the objective is to survive, but it's nothing more than a fairly small deathmatch arena, spread across a few small, lightly populated zones, each as bleak and barren as the next. You spawn in, you try and find guns and ammo raking through draw after draw and cupboard after cupboard, if you don't get ganked doing that then it's time for you to go do the ganking until your ammo runs out or you die, then repeat.I'm not sure what I was expecting, not alot because it's so cheap, but it's not my cup of tea, as they say! Theres no purpose, just a really old looking fps with very very light survival aspects, including a hunger meter that goes down ridiculously quickly and a building system with zero purpose at all.Not recommended, it's not bad, it's just not worth anybody's time lol.

								  Fun and easy to get right into.  Just have to say be on the look out for russians and american teens who enjoy saying ""you got rekt"". Be careful of who you let live around you espically people who say nothing and young sounding americans.  They enjoy stabbing you in the back.  I looked into the reviews of this game and saw everyone saying the same thing about the russian player base.  And in game I found this out to be true.  They are usally well armed move in groups of two and always open fire on you before talking.  I enjoyed hunting them down and every time I killed one they would say in a heavy russian voice ""I not Russian"".  All and all for the price, fun game to pick up and play.  I give this a 7 out of 10 and only because of the graphics but besides that good fun.			"

								To me? A great game things i'm listing what i like and things i don't really like**Things i love about the game**1.The game to be is basically DayZ, but with no thirdperson and the price is a MAJOR price downage.2.I may run the game with 30 fps but i can tell you, the gameplay is nice and smooth and easy to control.3.Sprinting does not run out quicky!4. Raining, Snowing, Night, Day, This is like a example of real life!5.Random spawning? Great for finding new things!**Things i don't like about the game**1. Finding people is very rare to me in this game2. Wolfs and Bears are to op3. Critical Damage from falling off a little leadge?4. I think finding stuff in this game is a little to hard, thirst and cookies are quick to find but guns and ammunition are rare.5.Backpack space should could a little more thing just 2 more added layers........6.Ladders and stairs could actually should have a animation for both of them.But in conclusion i really LOVE this game, just a few simple mistakes in there. Plus the game is in beta to it's not fully finished. Overall, i learn from my mistakes in this game. That's why now i a auto machine gun and some good gear.9/10   Just like DayZP.S. The price of this game should be higher like 10 or 14.99			"

								It is still a very basic game. But I am wondering, what is the purpose of it? What is the goal? If it is to survive, there are very limited resources to do so for a long period of time. If it is to be the main survivor, meaning to go around and shoot eachother for as long as possible, kk, I understand, just need to make it easier for weapons.Suggestions for improvement: -Make it so that you can put multiple logs on a fire so it will go for longer and so that you can restock it as you want and can keep a fire going so you can explore a bit and not have to use too many resources. -Herbology is a great skill to have in games like this. Maybe make it so that you can harvest herbs and stuff to make the medicines. Also maybe make it so that if you were to pick up extra clothes, you could turn them into bandages. Or even chop up furnature to get some bandages and wood.-A melee option so that if you don't have any weapons, you can actually hit people/animals. Maybe make it so that additional force can be used to bring down small trees? i can understand not the big ones, but at least the small ones. -When you have a map, have the 'M' key available to open it up without having to go through the inventory. Also, I didn't see any compasses, so it would be nice to know where north is.Would I suggest this game? When it is more completed and has an actual goal in mind, other than to survive (like to find some sign of civilization instead of everyone running around killing eachother, or something to that effect), I will def suggest the game. Graphics are good, never got stuck. The whole idea is over-used, but is still good in this format. I always do suggest trying something new when making games.			"

								The game is good for the price of $5. You got looting, weapons, crafting, building, and survival that makes the game enjoyable and worth the money. But there are many things that need to be changed/add/fixed.- Change esc into menu, honestly using the esc as a logout of server button is kinda stupid and annoying.- Add the ability to give your character name and customization.- Have the map tell you where you are, really the map is so confusing and just gives you the names of the area without giving you your exact location.- Add more threats, wolves and bears aren't enough.- Add some kind of crafting or combing guide to help new players.- And most important of all, let us switch to our 3rd weapon, there is absolutely no way for us to access our 3rd weapon unless you drop one.Overall, this game is good for the price and it is still early access, so hopefully they will fix and improve the game. If you can get this game now for $5 then it is worth the money. "

								I definatley do not recommend this game for anyone. I understand that the game is in early access but what I think is that they have tried to make a DayZ like pvp game, replacing the Zombies with glitchy wolves. There are barely any items scattered around the map and the map is also very small. We even joined one server and the main town in the map was all bordered of with wooden planks. I don't see any point to this game and if I was gonna recommend any game this would be at the bottom of my list. Waste of £3.50. This is just my opinion and others may enjoy it when it becomes a full game however this games really doesn't work for me.			"

								i love this game its pretty, well thought out,and after the news of the recent update with the inventory changes, and furnashing, i cant say im less then a tad excited xD,if i had 1,000,000$$ lying around with nothing to spend it on,,,, id give it to these developers to help fund the production of this game,its worth the $4.99 ($7.40+ AUD) and on the Australian note,,, MY PING IS ACTUALLY HALF DECENT!bring on this update guys, im keen as hell for it.something id like to see added..-more loot xD, cause you die often early game, and id like to catch back up (relatively) easily.cause losing everything when you die, sux enough. but nearly every draw is empty ;PRecommended?: Yes! A million times yes.love Nayfe P :)P.S. This is just my personal opinion, it might not be for you if your standards are higher then tommy chong in colorado.			"

								This game is too overrated... Honestly, what's so good about this?Played it for like half an hour and couldn't do anything...Read over the controls and everything as well.1) Went inside inventory after I picked up things, can't even have the option to throw things out of inventory. Can't drag and  can't click right or left to even have an option to drop item.2) Smashed this 1 guy with an axe over 18 times, and he's still not even dead. Did the hits even apply or are the people just really durable in this game? I see blood coming out but they're not dying.3) Cannot fight or even defend yourself with your fists or kicks until you find a weapon that's melee or a gun that must have the exact bullets / does not require cleaning / fixing / etc....4) Takes 60 seconds just to spawn back into the game5) Cannot even select items, not sure if glitched or what...6) Glitchy graphics such as people legs running like it could bend 360 degrees. Not sure if hits apply or not because 18 axe shots cannot kill a person that appears to be default with nothing on except pants. "

								Please know that I didn't buy this game. I got it in a giveaway.I'm going to give my First Impressions of this game, if you just want to get a quick glance at what this game offers, skip the first Impression bit, and check out the Pros and Cons. First Impressions I begin in a lit prison cell, i immedietly grab a screw driver and a lighter laying in the cell. I quickly pick the lock, and walk out of the cell, into an almost pitch-black prison... Which had me frightened... Would another character be sneaking about to get a few fresh spawn kills? Well no. I ended up just waltzing about in the dark for ten minutes until I grew tired and looked up what I needed to do. Ah, the torch in the prison cell can be picked up...Now since I have a light source, I quickly pick a lock, and jump into a sewer. As I waltz about in there, suddenly lightning flashes, and it begins to rain...In a Sewer, under the Prison...I soon manage to find a hole, leading to a loading screen... Taking me out finally into (What I thought hopefully) was the open-world. I waltz'd about for a little while around a trainyard, till I found a backpack. I left and followed a road... Which after five minutes of walking, took me to a loading screen. It was at this point I said ♥♥♥♥! Don't tell me this game has area loading screens! I found myself at what would appear to be a dinky little military outpost. As I would past it, I suddenly am flashed with another loading screen, as I then suddenly load back ALL THE WAY BACK THE TRAINYARD, WHERE I SPAWNED!?!? *sighs*My character starts to complain about being hungry and thirsty... Nonstop. Then he starts complaining about 27.3 C Temperature to be really chilly... WHAT!? Maybe 27.3 F... But 27.3 C is a bit... Warm.I FINALLY come across something, a bear. I swing at it a f- Dead.W-What!? No!? NO! I have to do that stupid prison opening again!?*Flash forward...* Climbing up a mount- Wtf!? I just TELEPORTED BACK AT THE TRAINYARD AGAIN!? WTF!?!?*A little while later* How do I eat? How do I drink!? I am clicking left and right, spamming the E button... SPAMMING ALL THE KEYS TO JUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO EAT AND DRINK!!!THIS was where I considered to stop playing.I mean... This game is broken. BROKEN. Empty as well. less then 60+ players total, and only 10 being on the most populated server. (Perhaps it would be best to remove a couple servers, and only have like 1 or 2 for the current population as of now.) Pros -Devs just got back to working on this game! Will change the review as development takes shape.-Vehicles, including Cars and Helicopters... Apparently. I never did find any.-The Graphics aren't that bad, and the game runs pretty smoothly. Cons -Broken... Just UTTERLY BROKEN. Ex. Spawning back in for me gave me double of all my items...-Inv. right now is a mess. (Update) The issues with eating and drinking was a glitch which didn't let me access any of my food or items.-No Character Creation-Voiced Acted Character... No, I think the characters shouldn't be voice acted. Just let the players do all the talking.(Seriously, the character just whines and moans non-stop.)-Very LOW playerbase.-More a recommendation, perhaps have an option to disable having to go through the long and dull process of the Prison. Conclusion? Survival :Postapocalypse Now is a very EARLY Early Access Game, on the lines of development so far. This is one of those times I wish steam had a So-so option to recommend. The devs show great potential, but right now the game is an utter mess. I'll come check it out again after a couple updates and PRAY it improves. :)			"

								This game is a good example of early access creating a positive dialect between players and devs.The game has gone under many changes since debuting, many driven by player requests (within reason so far).The actual game experience can be punishing, but for good reason. Lots of tedious and time consuming looting, typically only to then get blindsided by a stacked freak, or a group of them. The other side of that coin is that kills are meaningful and massive adrenaline dumps. It's actually a refreshing take on the value of a single life - while most games downplay the significance of a single life and create callused gamers.			"

								My god.Spent 20 minutes playing.Found 100 hostile players.Was killed a bunch by players.Someone said ""dont shoot"" when I had a magnum with no ammo, I asked him kindly for a melee weapon or ammo to defend from the wild beasts. He killed me with a axe. ♥♥♥♥.Its insanely hard to find Ammo, guns, or food. Its also hard to find working vehicles. I was chased for 10 minutes by rabid dogs in a school house whilst trying to find supplies. I ending up running out of the house before I was killed by dogs.I also found a guy whilst looting a house, another guy spawned, the same guy asks ""Dude, you friendly?"" The guy who spawns, promptly blows his head off with a ♥♥♥♥ing shotgun. Then attempts to blast me into hell with the same damn shotgun. I almost died, but ran off attempting to warn any passersby about the physcopath who killed that guy. hell, I thought the guy who spawned was the other guys FRIEND!			"

								This game has many, many issues.Firstly, it's impossible to create your own server since the patch, meaning you are duty bound to play on a server full of annoying kids from faraway countries who just kill you instantly. Secondly, it's full, and I mean FULL of glitches whereby you get stuck and have to kill yourself or remain trapped. Loot is impossible to come by on the empty servers... I see people (who are probably hacking) with amazing guns and seemingly endless supplies of ammo, while it takes me about an hour or two of play just to find a basic gun in good condition. The spawning system is particularly annoying: the prison spawn is ages away from anything good and takes too long to get away from. Also, players quite often ruin the game by boarding up useful buildings with the build tool. The devs claim that you can destroy player-made buildings, but you can't so if someone decides to do that (which they often do) the game is ruined. Oh, and they've ONLY JUST added in an option to change the graphics, although you still can't change mouse sensitivity, christ knows why.This game needs much, much work before it'll be playable.			"

								Absolutely worth $5.Melee combat has a lot to improve, but guns feel pretty solid and they're not as rare.The game world is big, it has lots of buildings as well as open space to set camp or even build a home, but has some loading screens inbetween areas (I think it's because apparently this game was on facebook first), which I'm hoping will go away as development progresses.There's a decent amount of loot, and different kinds of food and clothing, but some essentials are somewhat scarce.The graphics are good looking, movement and performance is smooth, and the system requirements are pretty damn low.The game world feels a bit empty in terms of ambiance, there should be more road signs and destroyed cars and rubble on the roads, but it's alright since the game is still on alpha and I imagine the devs are focusing more on gameplay and loot/content.Playing with friends is the best way to play. But surprisingly, there are many friendly players, so even if you're playing solo you might end up in a group. Don't worry though, there's also a lot of hostile, lone wolf kind of players and raiding groups, so sooner rather than later you'll come across some crazy guy that'll try to KOS (which, IMO, adds to the fun). Playing with friends and facing another group of players is interesting and fun, sometimes they'll trade and offer their help, or simply shoot you out of fear. I highly recommend getting this game, really cheap and fun.			"

								I took an honest go at liking the game but after 15 minutes of navigating an empty prison and only finding empty cupboards and no clues on how to get out, I resigned to the fact that I was probably stuck here.  All of the doors were opened, all locks picked, and the only thing I got out of my time was a pair of bright blue shorts and a mild case of motion sickness.  The game itself seems interesting but the concept of waking up in a prison as the only survivor, with a screwdriver and lighter locked in the cell with you, seems unbelievable.  The prison would better serve as an exploration point than a puzzle.  This is listed as a survival game and I've come to understand that they should be open-world.  This feels too sandbox like from the start to make me want to continue playing.And let's not even talk about server population.  The recommended server had 12 users...It seems like very few survive long enough to even play the game.			"

								Pretty good game. Has some bugs and optimization issues, but it's got potential.The good:-Lots of different guns to find-Working vehicles (suck it, dayZ)-Crafting-Only five bucks-Loot isn't too hard or too easy to find. You can actually die of dehydration, freezing, and hunger without being just some complete noob-Unique winter settingThe bad:-Many bugs, including a black screen bug (never go to the Marsh. they may fix this, but I haven't found out if they did yet)-Lots of KoS-When your character starts to freeze, get dehydrated or hungry, etc, he becomes very annoying with his complainingI'll give this game a 7/10. I haven't played with friends yet, but I imagine that'd make it about an 8/10 for me.			"

 For the DevsFrom what I've played of the game, it's a lot of fun. I've gota few things I'd like to see changed. Here they are:-Wolves/Dogs - Too hard for new players to kill.They have a very large detection range and are ruthless,and finding gear when you freshly start is hard with them around.-English - There's some mess ups in the game's text. Most notablywhen you're running out of food, it says ""Low Hungry,"" or ""Low Thirsty.""This should be cycled as (Fine, Hungry, Very Hungry, Starving.)-Communication - There needs to be a way to type to players.-Boundaries - I find it easy to get lost when going around, and when you go out ofbounds, the screen goes dark and resets you in a new spot. There should just be invisible walls,so you don't have to wait.-Loot - It's hard to get. Food and water and ammunition especially. I also found a problem with carryingmultiple weapons, if you have a pistol, primary and melee, you can only use the primary and melee weapons,the pistol is unusable unless you drop the melee. There needs to be more ammo, more inventory space,and more loot spawns/drops in general. -""Help"" menu - There needs to be a brief tutorial for the game somewhere, when I first got it I was veryconfused for about an hour.-Health - More medication needs to spawn. So many times I've looked for it, and I die from a wolf bite, thirst or hunger, or some various thing that could have been easily treated. I feel that the food should restore health, the variance in quality determining the amount. Ex: Raw Wolf Meat - Small amount of health restored.Through all this, the game is great! It runs well on my fairly bad laptop, it has a good and stable server lineup,the overall feel is more entertaining than most survival games out there. I'd give it a solid 6.5 out of 10.If the bugs and AI were patched, I'd probably bump it to an 8. It's very good, hope to see some updatescome soon.			"

								This game is Underdeveloped in a way. there are too many bugs/Too much open space areas in this game for it to be nothing but challenging when finding specific objects which of course is natural in a survival game however this game has huge issues which I do think need to be addressed. Servers are the biggest problem, There is no laungage barrier so sadly when your running into a player who does not speak your laungage then it truely is like a survival situation which actually does make this game more challenging than the rest, However this aspect of the game ruins any hopes to meet a ""Friendly"" player Or even a player that understands what your saying. There also needs to be more optimaztion for this game it is not running well on many systems. I would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge.			"

								This game has a lot of potential. But needs a lot of work and love. But I think it's worth the money, because it's a fun game. Yes it has some drawback,but don't forget, it's an alpha version. Recomended for all fans of postapocalyptic survival genre.For newcomers it can be hard,especially solo players, because of other players who hunt you,but be honest guys,in real postapocalyptic life,people are merciles :) Who whatched Revolution or The walking dead, 12 monkeys  series will understand :)The are couple problems and issues with this game,but I think developers will add them in the nearest future:-would be nice to see nicknames,add to friendlist on steam when meet somebody-give a handicap to new players or separate experienced from them who have a decent inventory(guns with bullets in particular)-add a tab,where you can see all the players in server and show stats ( for example how much hours in real time player stayed alive)Despite that,I recommend playing this with a friend or friends, it's hilarious :)			"

								I'm not going to lie to you: This is a difficult game. It's certainly harder than DayZ and unturned.  But if you've played those games your knowlage should translate.  Here's what makes this game stand out:You can die from so much more: In DayZ and Unturned, hunger  and players are your arch nemesis.  In this game you have hunger, cold, bears, wolfs, thirst, clothes, and even people that don't speak your language WILL kill you on sight.  This game is a harder DayZ with far fewer glitches (and a more bareable price tag).  So lets get down to my expiriences that will help you new players:This game is NOT friendly to new players, but at least you can get a hang of the controls.  The most helpful one is Z, if you can tell the people around you not to kill you then that's a perk.  Now, don't expect to run around for five minutes and find everything you need to survive.  It might've been that way in the prison but if you die you DO NOT return to the prison.  So if you have some high hopes of it being easy if you die you should head on over to DayZ or Unturned.  Next: If you don't want to be friends with someone you have an option: Kill them on the spot or rob them.  I prefer option two because it may save ammo.  Better yet: all guns you find won't have ammo, so if you simply point an unloaded gun at someone and threaten to shoot, they might never know.  Remember: once the robbery ends do not stick around. He might have friends.  If you feel like he didn't give you everything and you do have ammo: shoot him in the head.Next are animals: You have two threats in animals, they are wolfs and bears.  I've never seen a bear outside of the marshes so you shouldn't have too much panic.  The wolves are a different story, they are everywhere.  Good news is they're easy to kill, 2 axe swings or one shot will end them.  This doesn't mean they aren't dangerous however.Bears on the other hand I've only had one run in with, I can't say I liked it.  It jumped out at me in the marsh and scared the living♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me.  DO NOT FIGHT A BEAR.Next is food:  Food is a necessity, and so is water.  Find them and charish them.  Some food will require a can opener so be on the lookout for them.Cloths are vital.  If nothing previously listed kills you, this will.  Unlike Unturned or DayZ, you aren't in a habitable inviornment.  The enviornment of this game is norther Siberia.  If you aren't dressed right you will not survive.  You spawn in a pair of weird jeans (which I'm pretty sure have a swastica on the right leg) and some♥♥♥♥♥♥sneakers.  If you find a shirt put that♥♥♥♥♥♥on, you WILL freeze.  Players: TRUST NOBODY!  If you have friends, trust them but not too much.  They CAN and WILL turn on you eventually.  TO THE DEVS:  This is an amazing game but it needs some work:  I'd recommend slowing down the rate that you freeze to death and making more weapons.  Better yet: Let us be able to punch.Hope this helps you new playersEDIT:  You're going to want some music, I recommend anything by A7X if you like rock, Sabaton if you like metal, D12 Eminem Tupac or Kanye West if you like rap, Fallout boy if you like pop.EDIT 2:  I've since noticed that there aren't a lot of trolls, but when you find one they are very clever.  Always carry an axe with you so that someone doesn't block your exit with a massive wood wall.			"

								This is the first time I have reviewed a game, and that is because I believe in this game's potential so much.  I love survival games, and was pleasantly surprised by some of the aspects of the game.  I do not want to see this game fade into obsurity, which is why I write this in the hopes that someone with more influence than me can make this game more amazing.   First, what I loved.  The environment is nice to look at and does its job of making me feel like I'm stranded in the Siberian wilderness, scavenging long abandoned homes and buildings to survive.  Encounters with other players are- naturally-  cautious and untrustworthy, but how else would you react in a world where most of the population is dead?  NExt, the act of opening each individual drawer, locker, wardrobe and cabinet while scavenging for supplies goes a long way in immersing the player into the world- no menus or search timers.  The firearms are appropriately challenging to find (although sometimes you can find too much, for better or worse) and the realistic acts of loading the bullets you scavenge into magazines and being able to unload both gun and magazine is something I never knew I wanted in a survival game until I had it.  The crumbled buildings and abandoned structures are great for creating that lonely atmosphere that I love in a survival game. Food and drink are also tough to find(it is random, after all), but you won't always find mountains of food after the apocalypse (also, you need a can opener, screwdriver, or scissors to open canned food, which is a nice touch).These were only a few of the things that sparked my interest in this game, and I strongly encourage you to play it, and see what grabs your attention.  Now, let's move onto what I did not like, and some of the ways I think they could be fixed.  Please note that none of the following examples are NOT deal-breakers and are simply things that, if changed even slightly, can vastly improve the already immersive experience of this game.  First, temperature management; spawning in nothing but your underwear in the cold Russian expanse is lethal, but only having two ways to raise your temperature (a campfire and beer) and RNG making their discovery unpredictable is a great way to end up with stacks of frozen corpses.  I believe this can be fixed by making your core temp. decrease at a slower rate and having any clothing you are wearing protect you from the cold (that should be self-explanatory, right?)Next, wolves;  Yes, this is Siberia.  Yes, wolves are natural predators that will hunt you down relentlessly.  No, I do not enjoy being ripped apart by them immediately upon beginning my harrowing tale of survival.  You can easily fend them off with firearms and melee weapons, but until you get your hands on one, there's nothing to do except run.  This makes it difficult to scavenge for a weapon once a wolf has your scent, and the best strategy I found for dealing with them unarmed is to exit back to the menu and load back in hoping that they are gone.  Obviously, this is not a great way to play the game.  I recommend being able to attack unarmed and make the wolf retreat would be a great way to keep unequipped players alive long enough to find some basic gear.Multiplayer only servers.  Okay, this is more of a personal issue of mine and not any fault on the developers.  Unlike most people, I prefer to be the last man on Earth sometimes, I don't enjoy collecting backpacks full of gear and food only to be shot in the back of the head and realize I was basically doing someone else's grocery shopping.  I worked around this issue by always creating a new server when playing and then quitting out and starting another one when the number of players exceeded 4.  I would just like to get by and die on my terms, I hear wolves make great companions.Finally, and probably most basically, there's no settings or options menu.  Either I'm way more stupid than I think I am, or there is no way to change the settings of the game.  This is simple stuff here.So there... my first game review.  I love the way this game plays and feels.  The little things play a big part in making the game feel more real, and as I stated above, the problems are NOT deal-breakers, at least for me.  I think anyone on the fence about this game should give it a chance.  And if anyone with the ability to influence this game in any way reads this, then that's even better.Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to running around shootingmy M1911 at the wolves in my underwear.TL;DR- More methods of warmth, need to punch wolves, gimme dem settings.

								This game is Underdeveloped in a way. there are too many bugs/Too much open space areas in this game for it to be nothing but challenging when finding specific objects which of course is natural in a survival game however this game has huge issues which I do think need to be addressed. Servers are the biggest problem, There is no laungage barrier so sadly when your running into a player who does not speak your laungage then it truely is like a survival situation which actually does make this game more challenging than the rest, However this aspect of the game ruins any hopes to meet a ""Friendly"" player Or even a player that understands what your saying. There also needs to be more optimaztion for this game it is not running well on many systems. I would still recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenge.			"

								Currently in BETA, I believe. And yet it's brilliant. It runs so smoothly, the anti-aliasing and textures could do with a boot up the♥♥♥♥♥♥ but other than that the game's glorious and smooth and kinda spooky. Players are generally friendly and not out to kill eachother; oh.. and you can open basically everything.>wandering around, looking for stuff>see a pile of stuff behind a fence>jump over fence to get stuff>trapped in a square fence-cage with power relays in it>realise that the pile of stuff is from other people jumping into this venus-human-trap""oh ♥♥♥♥ing hell"">drop all the loot out of sight of outside the fence so nobody else gets trapped>suicide>end up finding the trap again later without realising>get trapped againPretty gud game ~IGN			"

								This game has a lot of potential. But needs a lot of work and love. But I think it's worth the money, because it's a fun game. Yes it has some drawback,but don't forget, it's an alpha version. Recomended for all fans of postapocalyptic survival genre.For newcomers it can be hard,especially solo players, because of other players who hunt you,but be honest guys,in real postapocalyptic life,people are merciles :) Who whatched Revolution or The walking dead, 12 monkeys  series will understand :)The are couple problems and issues with this game,but I think developers will add them in the nearest future:-would be nice to see nicknames,add to friendlist on steam when meet somebody-give a handicap to new players or separate experienced from them who have a decent inventory(guns with bullets in particular)-add a tab,where you can see all the players in server and show stats ( for example how much hours in real time player stayed alive)Despite that,I recommend playing this with a friend or friends, it's hilarious :)			"

								Having played the game for a few days now i can say that overall this is a fun game, it runs really well and looks great also. There are a few issues i have encountered such as melee attacks are a little, lets say just luck rather than skill to survive. Also, if you're not a fan of 'kill on sight' then this game is not for you (at the minute anyway) nearly every encounter i have had ALMOST ALL have been as a fresh spawn and i was instantly killed. But a definite reccommend and with more updates i can see this being a great little game in the survival genre.			"

								This was my experience with this game. I was all suited up with clothing to brace the cold and weapons to defend myself. I had a good bit of food, and I was just surviving, ya dig? But that wasn't the highlight of my time. At one point, I met another player with an awfully peculiar voice, kinda creaky and high. I don't remember our exchange, but I only remember using this text-to-speech app to speak through my iPod. Anyways, we went our own ways and I hadn't seen the guy for about ten minutes. I ended up at that large house by the side of a road, not too far from a boat at the bottom of a hill, and I entered the house. Suddenly, I hear a familiar, gritty voice that says, ""Hey, I'm stuck in the wall!"" I look for this guy, and I can't find him, and he's urging me to check the closet, so I do, and there's nothing there. The guy keeps saying he's stuck in the wall, and he's just kinda tittering to himself and I get all anxious and whatnot. After awhile, he stops speaking and I just sorta sit there, all creeped out because this guy was watching me from inside a wall. Asides from that, this is a really good game if you're not dealing with Russian jerks or guys that ask to team up and then start bashing you with a hammer.			"

								its a very developed game for the early alpha phase and, even though it is more developed than dayz, there are things to be worked on. dayz has a lot of thought put into so before you start judging dayz for being further behind just know that there are things that dayz elaborates on that this game doesn't. first off you cant bleed to death in this game and in dayz you can. survival post apocalypse now has way more vehicles than the standalone, however the standalone has put more work into their vehicles. lastly dayz has a sickness meter and a much larger map with dynamic item spawns (the helicopter crash sites dont always spawn in the same place and guns and items dont always spawn in the same area ). Also dayz in my opinion has less hackers and a better way of dealing with them than survival post apocalypse now. I recommend both dayz and survival post apocalypse now. If you want a ultra realistic zombie apocalypse, go with dayz, if you want a survival game that is easy than dayz but still challenging go with survival post apocalypse now.			"

Early Access Review
								Where to start. The reviews are mainly all great, and with good reason. Its a good game, especially for being $6. You can actually look down, and see your legs. One of the few games in which the player is allowed a lower body outside the inventoy page. The water physics are not the best, but optimal for the price, and even better than some other games. I'll just run down a list, or my review will just go on and on. Pros-Lower body, ohmygod, I have legs.-Decent water physics, for such a cheap price. -The inventory, despite being small, is realistic. People can only carry so much. -Everyone starts out the same way, which is good and bad, but good, because everyone has the chance to get a little stocked up before actually having to deal with the world's issues, and not have to worry about players having already looted the area.-Torches' flames go out when you are not holding them, and must be relit. Why is that a con? Its not good, but realistic, and thats the goal. Survival. I want to realize that I have to conserve fuel.-Stats. It doesn't give you bars, or percentages, you just have words, and your character will occasionally say something. I was dehydrated, so when I went into inventory, it said I was dehydrated, so I cracked open some sardines and reduced hunger and thirst, which brings me to my next pro.-Some items can reduce two things, such as sardines dropping thirst and hunger. Super handy. -Animals. I'm not sure what other games has animals, I know 7 days only has the messed up dogs and hornets, but this one has wolves. And bears. Glory to Mother Russia, right?Cons-No trust. Duh. If you play solo, you will die often unless you get lucky, run into almost noone, stumble upon some great loot.-Lack of water. Can I just eat snow? All I had were sardines. Nearly died before figuring out I could eat sardines to reduce thirst.-Climbing ladders looks so bad. I thought people had like a grappling hook, and were scaling up a tower, but no, they were just kind of floating up a ladder, no limbs touching, weapon drawn. -No day time? I'm not sure if I had to play longer, but there seemed to be no sun at all. Just darkness, and rain. -I'm really not sure if this is just me, but staying warm has been an issue. I've had my torch out, I have a sweater on, I stayed in doors, and still had temp drop. Curious if you need specifically a camp fire to warm up, or what. I really can't recall anything outside that, but that is what I think of the game. Is it worth $6? Absolutely. Especially if you can convince some people to play with you. I really hope this game keeps going and doesn't get discarded like most. 8.5/10			"

								First thing I would like to say is that I love this game. I love the concept, I love the variety of weapons and items at the momen. For an early access game it has quite a lot of potential.Pros:Huge variety of weaponsQuite a big world Nice calming/misleadingly calm sceneryGood for lower spec computers (for now)Fitting musicVery nice price at £4.79Cons:For some reason dogs can walk through walls or no-clip through walls which can get annoyingDogs stop moving but keep on animating, as if they were attacking you or someone if you're not on the same level as themThe edge of the world is a clear invisible wall instead of a mountain or buildings.Floating object such as trees and buildings. (which is a common glitch with this sort of game in this state so I understand why those sort of graphical glitches in a survival game such as this)No climbing animation so if you look at someone climbing a ladder they'll just slide up/down the ladder.Can't find supplies most of the time resulting in starvation, dehydration or freezing to death.The tutorial ain't easy to follow.Things I would like to see in this game:A single player mode so you don't have to worry about being killed by some random person.A more detailed main menu.The ability to change FOV (field of view) and mouse sensitivity.A sort of creative mode or sandbox mode so you can test out equipment or vehicles.But overall I really enjoy playing this game and I think it has a lot of potential.I would rate this game 7/10 for the moment, but to be fair this game is too early in production to judge at the moment.P.S I know I have only played around 2 hours of this, but I wanted to make a review because I disagree with all the people who don't recommend this game because of a few errors/glitches.

								I saw someone playing this game, and after a short while became interested in purchasing it. For the price, it's worth trying it out, even on a lower end PC, which is amazing. This is a survival game where you find items, combine them, and (if you're smart) survive the harsh elements while dealing with people who will either help you, or kill you where you stand. It can be a bit tough at first, but once you get to know what to do, you'll become cautious and acquire items to survive! As long as the minor issues are patched, and some different things (items, inventory layout etc.) are implemented, this can become a great release for the price! Keep up with the discussions, provide your feedback on issues, and hopefully the devs can help us out! I will definitely come back to this game and play it, and am excited to see what new features will come of this great little survival map in the near future! Trust me, it's bigger than it looks! ;)			"

								The game is cheap only $5 but despite that its just a bunch of spawn, loot a nearby house, find almost no loot thats worth taking then out jumps another player that proceeds to bash your skull in with a bat... watch him teabag your corpse for the next 55 seconds then respawn and repeat....The game has horrible hit boxes, it takes ages to find a gun then the magazine then the bullets for it, even if you find a gun and ammo chances are you wont survive the gun fight and if that doesnt kill you the cold weather will...Only way to restore health I have seen is vitamin bottles i randomly found in cupboards...Even if I survive my characters body tempature never stops dropping even if hes wearing some kind of top and pants and hat...Never live long enough to find a lighter or gasoline and try making a camp fire to warm up and even if i did it would be a beacon for all other players to come bash my head in and teabag me while taking my stuff...At least the game runs well on low end computers thats a plus			"

								I made a review about this game awhile back and reccomended it. After a great deal of time after playing this, i have a huge change of heart. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH 5$!! its worth .99cents at most....The game would be great if more poeple who talked and used their mics played it.It's Always shoot first, talk later, if you see a guy run or just KOS, they don't wanna talk or be friends, most don't even speak english.Your character dies too fast. it is impossible to get in a good 2 hours of gameplay without dying of thirst, hunger, or the worst of all, the cold weather. You can't find  resources fast enough to keep your character healthy. you starve and dehydrate too quickly before you can even find food and water. The freezing to death thing is annoying too. I had a character with thick jacket and a balaclava and i still froze to death!There is no tutorials for building items as well. The ways that the designers can make this game better.1.) Get more english speaking players that are active using the mic2.) Make it so you don't starve, dehydrate, or freeze to death as fast.3.) Put more Loot or supplies, or have them respawn faster in buildings.4.)Customizable character would be great too.5.) please nerf the damage that dogs do, or give more health to characters.If these changes are made i will make a recommended review again.

PS: there should be a way to make bandages, an arrow on the map to see where you are, and when you crash out the server your items should stay there for at least 5 minutes to pick them back up.			"

								DEVS are doing what players say! (big +++)ok afte this small fix its much better (less laggs)> realistic wind on trees > beautiful nightsfix:- mouse sensitivity is little better bad its still very horrible- motion blur? or what? (remove it or make us able to turn this off)- too dark in interiors at night (no brightness settings)- still need optimilization improvements- running- maybe third person in future will be fine - on mode selecting when you go on dm or tdm you cant go back on classic- weird sounds ( when you jump on fence its like jump on something created from metal )- wall textures appearing on windows- loading trees few meter in front of you- game needs better clouds in future (heavy, big, small) [different colours , white, dark blue depending on weather]- raindrops are too big during rain - in future game will 100% need a fully new better engine with much much much better graphic    (this graphic is not good) (its good only at night with stars and moon) 5/10 = 1 point for fast devs listening to players, 1 point less lagy gameplay, 1 point for modes, 1 point for big map, 1 point for lagging at start (u should put loading here instead of watch laggs and map loads xD)If you have good computer and you have nothing to do, then buy this, if no then dont buy this and wait for better version "

								DO NOT BUY THIS.As a fan of DayZ and other survival simulators, this is honestly the worst i've played. Shockingly, I'd happily play the abomination known as infestation survivor stories (WarZ) over this. Even though this is labelled as 'Early Access' it is not in a state to be released to the public. Some of my frustrations being:- Controls can't be edited in game- The ESC key returns you to the main menu- The inventory system is clunky and makes no sense- God awful generic jumping sound- Constant ambient sounds from wildlife on loop (owls hooting etc!)- Combat not fluid at all. Other players and wildlife sliding around.Some may ask why the hell I even bothered buying this. Well the truth is that I was really hoping to have a decent DayZ alternative to play. After reading the store page, which painted an optimistic picture, and reading the majority of positive reviews, it seemed easy enough to part with low price point of a few quid. However, it's the same rubbish that we've all seen before. A game made on an ok engine which has a few standard features that you see in all DayZ clones and then put to market. I will not be making this mistake again!			"

								So yes, this game is only $5 and I'd like to think that it has a lot of potential. But as of where the game stands right now, I can't recommend playing it. You're constantly getting killed before you can aquire any decent loot (either by players or wolves, since there is no melee attack). There doesn't seem to be enough loot for the amount of players on the server. Everytime you walk into a building there is more than likely another player in there, recently has been there, or walks in and kills you while you're in there. Even though I don't recommend it right now, I'd like to think, that over time, it will get much better.			"

								You start the game ""naked"" and cannot even use your fists to defend yourself from hordes of dogs everywhere... You join a game, you usualy die after a few seconds, or minutes if lucky... Or you may play an hour if you were lucky enough to spawn near other players ready to help you... Means... I don't see the point... Why make people spawn randomly with NO way to defend themselves and being surrounded by hounds`??? Is that fun? Well, for the devs maybe... Not for the player who restart the game 12 times and only get some luck after the 11th time he restarted the game... + there is NO way to go back to the main menu, you have to wait 60 freaking seconds to ""revive"" all the time.................

								Very Nice! Im not sure if they still develop the game but even if they dont anymore its still a very playable and enjoyable game!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Heres my review/video :

			★Links Below↓ _________________________________________________________________________________________________ ★Sonor Sound★ : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbC08NxybCqH4eTted411oA...		

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Ok so I spawned in a town found some stuff like food etc found a gun! That was nice finally found a wepon in a survival game then got killed after a while of searching. 2ND time playing. Spawn in find a rifle and a backpack. Find my friend we see each other then i die of bleeding out because of dogs or are the wolfs? Any ways - Over all a fun time even though it was short - The devolpers should work on a prone and crouch that are not on the  same button so like c to crouch and x to go prone - Get rid of the crafting all together since it can no clip threw walls etc - Add it in another time - They should work on a warming system since its mostly cold and windy - Something like The Long Dark -They should also add a better crafting system like a menu or something so you can make a bow and arrows easy by first finding an axe or hatchet etc then chop wood or be able to craft a stone hatchet by picking up stones and wood then opening the crafting menu with i or something instead of having q and i the same button for the Inventory. The sound i think is amazing like the wind and snow also add a snow effect outside say if inside or something because iv seen the snow goes away maybe to stop lag or something but your mostly out side so keep it out when in a house or something. Any ways a very good game for the price and for an early access - Cylinder - Hardcore Gamer -			"

								First of all. I will try to be fair here in the perspective as both a gamer and a fellow developer. This is not a flame review nor a you guys suck review. It is more like some friendly critics that I hope you guys would notice in a good and friendly way. And take into consideration when you keep on developing on the game.Gamer :  I would not recommend this to anyone in its current state. Item management is clumsy, Wildlife is clitchy as ♥♥♥♥. Sound and GFX (Even on Fantastic) gives you a migrane after a few minutes. Game seems way to small, i mean the few mins I have spent there it seems like i went from 1 invisible wall to another. Would not recommend even if it was free to play, and I dont understand why people would play this, when Dayz. Rust, Ark etc. is on steam.Developer. As a ""open world"" survival game 40 km2 is pretty small. Ones you are ingame it doesnt feel like 40 km2 at all though. it feels a lot smaller. Even though you announced that the game have a ""Giant world with ability to keep up to 40 people on 1 server"" As a comparrison DayZ chernarus (Mod) with 40 players felt small and that is 225 km2.You currently announce ""Our game is almost in a finished state"" Current state of the game in a ""normal"" roadmap is alpha state. The whole world need a redesign. roads overlapping each other in weird places, trees halfway inside buildings/floawing 5-10 cm over the ground. Props/assets needs a overhaul. wildlife ai, controls, UI and Hud needs a tweak, it looks like something that got rushed into greenlight.It might have been. I cant say for sure. I can see the whole idea with releasing a ""New"" survival game, and with the right angle you would be able to do that with success, no doubt about it. Kudos for the rain effect on the HUD. That is pretty neat though. And try and keep your facebook site up to date with the steam info. And avoid buying likes (Not sure if that is the case but the facebook meta on you page is extremely low considering there is 12k likes.)- Low Meta is bad for business, and fewer automatic adds posted in the ""Sponsored"" tab in facebook.This is the info on Facebook. - Awesome 3D graphics.(When saying Awesome 3D graphics, I think back when I saw Farcry for the first time, and I was like OMFG it is pretty, But in reality the current graphics, on fantastic makes the game look like a poor mans Arma 1 mod.)- Game world of 7 km2. (feels right when I played)Overall I would say good job in selling 3200+ copies. thats around 20k Euro :) Still show that there is a market for this type of games even though it seems rushed. Join ""Indie Game Promo/Indie Game Developer & GameDev Beginners"" on facebook. That have helpded me a lot regarding promotions, roadmaps, changes that needs to be considered before greenlighting a game. Or you can add me and I will gladly help out with what ever I can. promotions, marketing tips etc. anything!. I wont charge a dime. I will stick around and give this game another try, in the future. Cause I am a sucker for Post Apocalyptic survival games :DBest of luck and I hope to see this game develope to something awesome.  "

								     I wanted to love this game; but there is a reason I only have 0.2 hrs on record. I have a fairly decent gaming computer. I can run skyrim at max settings with no issues at 65 FPS and the fans barly have to move to keep the computer cool. This game is an enigma of programming a bugs. I first played it at my sisters house for an hour, her computer has similar specs, and this game was crashing, FPS was all over the place, and items, vehicels, and fun are no where to be found.      I love the idea of the game. It has a great base that needs no further explaining other than "" Its Russia, it fell, its everyman for himself, have fun"". However the exucution was aweful. The devs simply gave up. The bugs won't be fixed. The gameplay won't be improved. People in their right mind won't play it. Don't waste five dollars. Hopefully someone else will take the game over and actualy do something with it. It has the potential to be a hit if they would at least try.			"

I fully understand it's in the early stages but the lag and is unbearable at times. Spending an hour collecting gear only to be killed by something that is not in the room or missing a point blank shot to the head with a shotgun is beyond frustrating.With all the issues i keep finding myself going back to play a few rounds every week.  Whats with being able to build a house? Does anyone actually do that? Seems a silly feature for this game. The game would be better if they focused on speeding up the game instead.I give it a 5/10 but with a few tweaks it could be much harder. Give it a few months and I'll re evaluate the game but right now It's far from a finished product "

Early Access Review
								I got this game a few months ago for the first time. I then returned it, only having about an hour and a half in the game, only reason was to get DayZ (which did not work even in the slightest), I did not re-purchase for a couple of months due to other things I wanted until I realized... I really missed this game. Sure its not as polished as even DayZ (DayZ still does need work), but this is a damn good game. it was one of the first games I bought off of steam, and to this day is still one of the best. if you're looking for a fully finished game that is completely perfect, then....... well go look up....... oh wait thats right, no game is perfect. every game has its flaws, and this game's flaws are nowhere near game breaking. I will say though, that this game is best played with at least 1 friend, but is 110% worth the $5 it costs. it is very hard to find a game for $5 that is beter than this one, more so the ""survival"" genre. So even if you have to go and specially buy a steam card for this game, it is most definetly worth it. I can not stress enough that this game, is a good replacement for most-all survival games out there, excludeing zombie related  (only because i really like zombie survival games because of the ""war on three fronts"")			"

								Most of the reviewers don't even have more than 2h of playtime. This game is simple but nearly everything works the way it was thought to. It's all about surviving. Surviving wild animals or human players doesn't matter. You also might watch out to not freeze to death!It's thrilling. Every time a new experience. You work hard and get rewarded ""ok"". It's post-apocalyptic Syberia what did you think?!Based on the Unity engine. graphics, models and animations look ok. I love the ambient sounds of the game but they are very repetetive, but still enjoyable. Lighting and light effects are pretty and at night it can get spooky.All features seem to be working except for the ""cargo mission"". When I first played this game I was surprised because of that. I was able to do everything my ""post-apocalyptic surviving me"" could think of. I'd say ""It just works"" but it doesn't for everything. It's early access. But thats ok.I can't recommend this game for it's current state. (Long time no update, hackers with cracked clients) BUT the devs claimed to be back and I really look forward to see what they will come up next with. At least set it on your wishlist if you don't want to risk anything.5€ is a fair price for everything that you get. It's a lot of exploring and finding out how everything works by yourself.Had a lot of fun with it. Will have a lot of fun with it.			"

								This game has a glimmer of hope coming it's way in the form of updates.  Anticheat to ban the hackers and a new look and feel to the game.  For early access Survival: Postapocalypse Now has got a few hiccups and the hackers are everywhere but the is going to be a thing of the past very soon.  New feel to the game play and one large map to get lost in.  I have been lost far to often already.... Grab your copy for only $5.99 and you can't go wrong with this game.			"

Early Access Review
								I'm 3 hours into this game, and its a pretty basic little survival game. To me it is well worth the 5 dollars. Basically abandoned but works just fine most of the time in its current state. Understand that this is a PvP game. Everyone (and I do mean EVERYONE) is trying to kill everyone else, that's the point, and that's the fun of it. Do not get attached to anything you find, you'll probably end up losing it to the next guy, before the someone else kills him, and the cycle continues. Kill, loot, repeat.When you finally gear up enough to get your first kill its going to feel amazing, and you might even find yourself on a roll killing a couple of people before you're offed yourself and become a loot-pinata. Servers are pretty unpopulated, but even if you're on a map with one other person you're going to run into them and one of you is going to kill the other unless you're both completely unarmed. In which case you both lucked out, now run away, loot the nearest building and hope to find a weapon before they do. You will struggle to find food, stay warm, and to have inventory space enough to fill your basic needs. Weapons are scarce, ammo is scarcer, and your best bet is a melee weapon and no flashlight (ie no noise, no spotligBut as you keep playing  you just might find yourself surviving longer and longer. To figure out the controls you can use the 'Help' selection on the start page for a list of keybindings. Theres basically no other in game instruction, and  It doesnt tell you that you use 1 + 2 to switch weapons, but thats how you do it. You can only carry 2 of them. Anyone complaining about the game being too hard is a acting like a pansy and has no business playing survival games.			"

								Horrible Horrible! Wouldnt be bad if they actually done a few simple things to make game worth a damn! For one and prolly the most ridiculous of all is the inventory storage lol it is pathetic you can only carry very few items! sure you may find a gun but oops no room for a small box of ammo?! or if you have that guess what your not gonna eat or drink cause theres no room to carry the crap! That is one of the biggest issues in the game. plus everytime you find a gun guess what..... yup no ammo EVER!other issue is the graphics are literally playstation 2 gfx! I mean yea game is early access and all and even cheap but the inventory slots are what really makes me bitter. to enjoy a game you have to be able to actually get the things that are in the game that are supposed to make a game enjoyable.

								Game has the worst anti-cheat possible do not buy the game. People can mark you as a cheater and get you banned. If you kill them they just mark you as a cheater and you get auto-banned. Hackers can even ban you spawn in items and get control of a developer panel in which they can do certian things I currently do not know. PLEASE I KNOW YOU ARE READING THIS DO NOT BUY IT IM SERIOUS! People usually spawn in M4's with mods on the gun. The creators of the games know about the buggy game and they are ""Fixing it"". This is like bad rats with guns. Good luck trying to survive in this game because you will get spawned killed going to a different part of the map. The spawns in the games are trash.Gameplay: 7/10Graphics 2/10Netcode: 5/10Hackers: Usually there are two hackers on the bigger servers.			"

								this game is fairly unfinished, given that it is an Early-Release game.

								It has an enjoyable gameplay but when you spawn right near the school (without any items) wolfs attack you immediately so you die before even arriving to the school. If you put guns, bullets and gasoline frequently in the map, I would be so happy. I love ""the prison"" because before entering the wildlife you can find ""starter"" items easily (ex. a lighter, a torch, a jacket... etc.) I recommend this game for the beginners who want to play survival games because this game teaches the basics of surviving.

								Saw this game on steam about two weeks ago. With the price tag of 5.99 usd I figured I would give it a try even though I wasn't expection much from it. It started me off in a prison. After leaving there I traveled to two new locations. I starte looting stuff in draws, cabints, lockers, and such like other games do(dayz standalone). The game wasn't to bad until I started running into other players. Most had top tier gear and was just camping the noob area. So I died, died, died, and died so more. Couldn't leave the noob area and if I did, I would get killed by a player not long away. ---Pros----The loot system is good for a game of this price.Good amount of items/guns/tools.-When you go to other locations, it is it's own instance.---Cons----Players camping new player locations with top tier gear.-Hard to play alone on servers with more players on them.So would I suggest this game to anyone? If you like pvp survival games like dayz and just kos then this is for you. It's on 5.99 usd atm and if you don't like it after playing for less then 2 hours, you can ask for a refund like I did from steam. So I give the game a 4/10 for the looting/instance travel.			"

								I played 23 minutes of this, so take my review with a pinch of salt.The game is currently unplayable for computers less than one thousand pounds. I have a powerful computer and the frame rate was far too low to continue playing. If you are not like myself and most of the community and have an excrutiatingly expensive computer, by all means, I recommend it, but in it's current state, I don't recommend it at all. I did not die, I did not encounter anything, just twenty minutes of boring, slow, gameplay. I saw good reviews and thought 'This will be good!' and it wasn't. Developers: You really need to reduce the sizes of the map and do what you can to try to reduce the mass lag or nobody will play. Don't get me wrong, I like the game, it's a good idea and brilliant design of the maps and things, but there are far too many small glitches and bugs. There are also things like super slow frame rate, I was going at a rate of 5fps on a server with two people. It's ridiculous, my computer is powerful, so I was like: wtf?I do not recommend this game in the current state it is, but buy if you want to. I only played 23 minutes so don't take my review seriously, but that was my experience before it was too laggy and I quit.Please update the game with improvements. Email me at winnerasyougo@gmail.com if you wish to ask for what bugs and glitches are in the game.  I code and do designing, I can help with the development of the game, if you wish for my help, I am willing to give up my time for it. But for now, I'm refunding it, I'll rebuy it at a later date, but honestly, it really does need fixing.			"

You can't survive, you will die from wolfs all the time, or players... NO WAY TO DEFEND YOURSELF!I first saw it from some gameplays or pictures, I found it really great, but really, it's a scam, what a waste of money.They are showing you the ""unreachable"" part of game, cars, build your base, helicopters etc... LOL, nothing really exists!The inventory sucks, and the items ""combination""... anyways, that was my opinion for this game. I hope developers take a look on the negative reviews, to fix it lil bit! :)2/10			"

								I dont like leaving bad reviews, but this game hasnt impressed me at the slightest, everytime you die you have to get out of some abandoned prison, which is like playing slender, pitch black, in pans labrynth, way to stressfullPros:The running sound affects are coolishfor £/$3.99 its an OKAY time passerCons:hassel when respawning(you have to wait like 1 min just to clarify no one is going to revive you)The inventory controls is like trying to solve the da vinci codeVissuals are very cheap and rushed by the looks of itfor triple the price you can buy a game called rust which is like $15 or £14.99 depending where you areWould i recomend this right here right now as your reading this?not really, keep your money and go buy some dlc for Dota, payday, CS or something			"

								to be honest i really wanted to like this game it was a great idea it is a open map game and is kinda fun you start out with nothing witch is expected in a cage they do not show you how to pick locks it is pretty easy to get a hang of though but here are the problems there are about 24 active players at all times 3 servers aall the same map you have to watch out for wild anamals witch is no big deal but finding a gun is hard you will find ammo but no guns and when you find a gun yes you can kill people or protect your self but it gets lame after that and then you say well  i can get a team togeather this will be fun nope unless you speak russain no luck on thatthere are a lot of cheap fun games but i personally feel like this is not one of them maybe of you could make somethings like a building you could go in and call home or a fort or somthing becuse after you find a gun and ammo and a backpack with some food you are set and the game gets lame...

								This game has a lot of potential to be one of the best survival games in contemporary market. Although it's still in alfa, but you can find tons of different loot (weapons, clothes, food etc) and make harsh environment more friendly. But the main reason is to survive trough getting constantly : thirsty, hungry and especially cold. You have to battle all the time to be sure to keep those 3 stats ant None and 36.6 value. Second if hunger or cold won't kill you, angry russians will (and a ton fo wolves and couple bears :D). PVP in this game is really realistic and encourages players to communicate with each other to overcome together every obstacle you meet in this game.But as for now this game has quite a lot of bugs :Random teleportation through the map, or even to another serverYou can't (yet) destroy other players wood house, they exploit it to block entrance to looting areas (houses and etc)Most importantly HACKERS - they can even ban you via spectator console and you will see the infamous ""cat in the jar"" rather than actually play the game. Second in starting areas alot of people are using AR's or M4A1's with unlimited ammo or other sort of advantage. These things seriously impact the overall performance of the game... Hope Devs will fix these things..But overall - Would recommend this game 11/10 cause of angry russians and harsh environment  "

								Got this game with my friend for a little survival fun. But is that what I got... You start off in a prison which looks like a scene from a horror movie so much so actually I went backed to the steam page to see if it was a horror game. Once out of the prison you are spawned onto a map. A map in which tbh is quite boring. With annoying dogs and a boring environment that is quite lacking graphically. But I would be able to forget all that if it wasn't for the loot. Loot is so incredibly hard to find and what little you do find isn't usually helpful. But it gets ""better"" me and my friend actually manage to find a gay, my friend walks up and says hi the gay turns to us screams through his mic in a heavy Russian accent ""GIVE ME YOUR MEAT"" saying I had no meat I figured he meant the meat off my bones (you can eat people you've killed) he then process to chance us with a shot gun for 15 minutes.

								This game gets unnecessary flak for certain things. Sure, the game isn't necessarily graphically beautiful, but most of the mechanics are solid, if a little bit rough around the edges. If it were Day-z's cousin, it'd be the cool cousin with the mullet and questionable tattoo. It's more casual, and in my opinion, more charming. It has a STALKER feel, which is something I really liked. However, all this aside, there doesn't seem to be very many players... Hopefullly that will change, hopefully people will pick it up and play.			"

								Yet another game developers lack skills to finish...do not buy this title. And please stay away from their future games as well. Only if they are finished and has reasonable amount of reviews from people who did not get paid for their reviews. "

								to be honest i really wanted to like this game it was a great idea it is a open map game and is kinda fun you start out with nothing witch is expected in a cage they do not show you how to pick locks it is pretty easy to get a hang of though but here are the problems there are about 24 active players at all times 3 servers aall the same map you have to watch out for wild anamals witch is no big deal but finding a gun is hard you will find ammo but no guns and when you find a gun yes you can kill people or protect your self but it gets lame after that and then you say well  i can get a team togeather this will be fun nope unless you speak russain no luck on thatthere are a lot of cheap fun games but i personally feel like this is not one of them maybe of you could make somethings like a building you could go in and call home or a fort or somthing becuse after you find a gun and ammo and a backpack with some food you are set and the game gets lame...

								This game has a lot of potential to be one of the best survival games in contemporary market. Although it's still in alfa, but you can find tons of different loot (weapons, clothes, food etc) and make harsh environment more friendly. But the main reason is to survive trough getting constantly : thirsty, hungry and especially cold. You have to battle all the time to be sure to keep those 3 stats ant None and 36.6 value. Second if hunger or cold won't kill you, angry russians will (and a ton fo wolves and couple bears :D). PVP in this game is really realistic and encourages players to communicate with each other to overcome together every obstacle you meet in this game.But as for now this game has quite a lot of bugs :Random teleportation through the map, or even to another serverYou can't (yet) destroy other players wood house, they exploit it to block entrance to looting areas (houses and etc)Most importantly HACKERS - they can even ban you via spectator console and you will see the infamous ""cat in the jar"" rather than actually play the game. Second in starting areas alot of people are using AR's or M4A1's with unlimited ammo or other sort of advantage. These things seriously impact the overall performance of the game... Hope Devs will fix these things..But overall - Would recommend this game 11/10 cause of angry russians and harsh environment  "

It is in early alpha so it might not be that freat of an experience right now as i think there are to much snow landscape and almost no cities. And that u have to teleport to other parts of the map. Otherwise it looks pretty good and in my opinion the best survival early alpha game right now!			"

								This Game is really, really awesome if you understand after knowing how to play it. Except it laggs on laptops which you have to turn down the graphic resolutions of the game but its ok. My first time i held a PP-19 ''PP-Bizon'' and after 5 Minutes i got eliminated by a Sniper... so sick... -.-But it was fun though, i mean i have been through all map areas and it is fun to play.By Teaming the thing is you need to learn a little of russian, most players are russki which i can't speak.Last Time i met a russian guy and we teamed up, after that we were getting shot at by snipers again.. He combatlogged while the sniper was shooting at us, what the hell.------------------------------------------------------------------Bad News: There are Cheaters ingame and the new Update of this Saturday says ''There will be no more Bans but only for 1h'' I have read this just now and i was thinking, how will i ever play that game again?The Cheats are really strong in this game, you have no chance of Surviving which made my Opinion from Recommend (Yes) to (No) unless TB Games really starts fixing their game instead of abandoning it and not answering anything since March 2016..- Best regards, de Valuab7e			"

								wow...... wow.... so I waited the ~4 minutes for it to load, whilst the russian drinking music was playing in the background, it finally starts with the player being stuck in a prison cell, a torch, lighter and screwdriver. Cell door is locked. Some player spawned in my cell so I went all russian prison inmate and beat the living f**k out of him, he screamed some gibberish (really how to turn off the voice chat!!!!) whilst I was hurling the firey torch (no way could I equip the screwdriver!) down on him, and carrying on even though I knew he was dead..... after all, there is no hint of a way to escape so there is NOTHING else to do!TL;DR - this is why we need to go to war with russia, and nuke them back into the stoneage. The developers, or human garbage, need to be destroyed with the force of over 9000 suns exploding at once over their pessie little backwards town. Then we should follow up with fuel air bombs just to make sure these scummers have been wiped out.oh I just wanted you to read this as ""thumbs up"" are listed first.			"

								Great game, the only thing that would put people off are the hackers and not many players. You need to implement some sort of tutorial and ranking system to keep players online. I really enjoy this game, I'v played about 28 hours. Otherwise its a very fun game.For the newbies that are wanting to join... here is a quick tutorial.Find Axe, chop down tree. Find hammer, click Q in your inventory will be wood from cutting the treenow hold your hammer while clicking the wood, you can now build. everything else is self explanitory really.To find out what gun you have click Q and look at the bottom of the screen, it will tell you what bullet its takes. Make a fire, wood + gasoline + Lighter. Exploring is probably the most fun. It is a challenging game and takes patience.			"

								Sorry for bad English bla bla...I like this game?No. Of course not.I love post-apocalyptic survival games. I really love them.But this is not a survival game.This is ''Surviving in Russia Simulator.''Russians... Russians everywhere...For example:One Russian ran to me. For kill of course.And i beat him up like a dog.And he swears...If you want to hear Russian swear words, Play DotA 2 or CS:GO. Just do not buy this game.			"

								So far, this game lacks most of the necessary basics (no in-game communication for one). It has potential... if the developers actually put the effort in, but as it sits, it is unplayable.At this time, I would not recommend this.			"

Stupid controls, 5 different buttons on my keyboard opened the inventory/menu.No idea what to do or how to do it.Here's the rundown of 10 minutes ingame.I picked the lock on the door, game crashed.Picked it again, tried to open another door, game crashed.Finally exited starting area, stood there looking at nothing, as the graphics wouldn't load up.Got refund.

I just played it 30mins did not see anyone in the server (where 40 people should be) and there was nothing to do or find.. graphics are ok but not new gen or so. I recommend getting an other survival game. If you want to build anything with allot of people and even underground then I would say play '7 days to die' thats fun!			"

								First of I bought this game because I played the Facebook Version. Thinking it would be better on Steam but the truth is at least for ME no It's its not. It's to hard to find gun's or ammo for them the area is to small with little to no supplys ,everyone is your enemy .It's a good survival game I really love the rain effects well done for that but there are to many little bad things about it that ruin it ,give more maps give the ability to create your own server to explore the land before jumping into a server with lots of other players, Add a map ,add some type of chat box.Of course If you can put up with all of the stuff that for ME make it unplayable then go ahead enjoy your time just make sure you have a friend when playing so you dont have to restart all over again and find everything you've lost.

								I havent played a whole lot of this game but so far its pretty good for the summer sale price anyway ($4.94) .Its pretty straight forward and easily understood as in there doesnt seem to be a lot of hidden types of craftinglike RUST, MISCREATED, THE FOREST and so on. The server i was on ran smooth and i had a steady 100fps with no lag noticed. Keeping in mind this is early access i hope more things will get add like easier access to drinkable fluids cuz that was one thing that annoyed me only finding one can of soup and one bottle of what looked likegatorade lol. I came across 3 people in the short time i played...2 friendly...1 very agressive russian that i couldntunderstand and had to kill or be killed lol. Anyway..for the price try it out, i was unsure to and at this point i dont regret my purchase. Hope you enjoy :)			"

								ABANDONED: DISREGARD MY POSITIVE OPINIONAlthough it feels like it's very buggy and many things don't make sense in this game, it's still the most fun I've had in a survival game ever that isn't the DayZ mod. It's offered for a very cheap price and the developers update often and listen to the community. There's no annoying glitchy zombies, instead there's wolves and bears, which although are also glitchy and buggy, they make the game more fun and less silly.The gameplay is just amazing and if it weren't for the fact that the map ends at one point, I could be playing this forever. It's great for cooperative gameplay and survival is difficult, this game does the survival aspect right. It isn't just gather food, find a weapon and vehicle and then go kill a bunch of people, you also need to check your temperature, water and food is relatively scarce and medical supplies don't magically fill you to 100% health. You can get killed in just a few shots and if you get shot at, it will be difficult to fire back.There's so many different things that can kill you in this game, and it's amazing, even at this state. 8/10			"

								This is a good game and good setup and all but theres more downsides then positive but the positives are more basic to the game Downsides-1.) Every house is the same (almost) and tree2.) Kinda buggy3.) people kill you on sight Postitive-1.) sight is beautiful2.) very easy to play3.) great fps5.) easy to navigate 6.) devs update constantly and may be annoying but at least they are working on a game that means something to them.This game is a total recommend and even though there is downsides it wont affect you that much in the game but at least for an early access game its great keep it up devs			"

								This has promise if they can keep the development going. Right now, it's amusing for a while, but the lack of some functions such as building or hand-to-hand combat makes it not quite ready for prime-time. But it *is* an alpha.If you're into this kind of thing, right now I'd suggest 7 Days to Die or The Long Dark.			"

								I havent played a whole lot of this game but so far its pretty good for the summer sale price anyway ($4.94) .Its pretty straight forward and easily understood as in there doesnt seem to be a lot of hidden types of craftinglike RUST, MISCREATED, THE FOREST and so on. The server i was on ran smooth and i had a steady 100fps with no lag noticed. Keeping in mind this is early access i hope more things will get add like easier access to drinkable fluids cuz that was one thing that annoyed me only finding one can of soup and one bottle of what looked likegatorade lol. I came across 3 people in the short time i played...2 friendly...1 very agressive russian that i couldntunderstand and had to kill or be killed lol. Anyway..for the price try it out, i was unsure to and at this point i dont regret my purchase. Hope you enjoy :)			"

								Looking for a cheap DayZ clone that'll run fine on your crappy PC? Look no further! This is a reasonably competent take on the zombie survival trend from a small-time development team out of Russia. It is Early Access, so you can expect some bugs and a lack of polish. Huge map but it is not seamless. When you cross into a new area the screen will go black for a few seconds while it loads the new area... The game uses a crap ton of RAM all at once to load up that new section. If you're using a 32bit OS, then it's probly gonna crash due to the 2gb limit for applications. I was able to fix the crash using this http://steamcommunity.com/app/351290/discussions/0/598198356186535393/ "

								Update of my positive review of this game : Do not buy it, doesn't matter how cheap it is ! the game used to be ok, now the devs ♥♥♥♥ it up every new update. They say they listen to the players' complaint but they don't, all they care about is how the game looks and because of that this game is poorly optimised, you can see it on the screenshots, even the devs have 15-20 fps,and you get that if you're lucky enough to actually access the game, it is umplayable, tons of hackers too. I met great people playing this game but almost all of them think the same as me now, there is no joy in playing the game. and this review comes after months and months of waiting, I had hopes things will change, but things got even worse !

								Not really a game i would let my friends play... yet.Its got potential and i can see where they are trying to go with this but being killed as soon as you enter a game is not very fun. my game play went like this basically:Start as a noob character, whats that i hear a faint noise of a voice from somone else i pay with? What no way to chat with them because there is no text to chat?( to avoid spammers probably)Got a mic but can barely hear anyone else( probably my settings but idk which) walk a few yards find the first house looks like a fishing shack. Oh no there is two russians who dont speak a lick of english killing noobs, with guns. Respawn! ( 60 seconds to wait for a respawn and watch the guy that killed me t-bag my body. Didnt even know t-bagging was still trending since COD ghost)Found a nice chucrch already looted :/ too bad but found a hat though so cool. * Killed by a random person with a baseball bat from behind* Oh and another 60 seconds to wait for a respawn and watch the guy kill 2 more noobs at the church and loot all their stuff. Ohwell i guess there is people who pry on noobs but they make gameplay very... not fun. my fnal life before i decided to get off at 4:00am i spawned at the beginning again with nothing but a bat. I started off walking to the fishing shack, nice to know the russians got bored and left. I immidiatly took off across the river this time( thats right you can swim. rock on) found another bigger church(heard some footsteps inside) Snuck around but too bad even crouched footsteps can be heard like stomping. found all kinds of gear, a nice orange hat, a nice white sweater( good for the cold cause damn its cold) found some water and some food and a can opener woot!. Posted up here for the night :PAnd thats all for now might play some more later but the constant... lone wolfing gets boring. If you play this game be sure you play with a friend you know or somone you trust cause being on your own is really no fun. "

								Start off Naked and afriad (and cold).  First building I see, I run into.  Find a nice sweater and an axe.  Score!   Suddenly some a-hole with tattoos all over his body comes in with a baseball bat.  He clobbers me one, but I run away.   Note to self...stay away from people with weapons.  I start to explore, soon finding what looks like it used to be a military outpost.  Find some weapons and ammo.  Cool!  Now I'm fully clothed and have a shotgun with lots of ammo.   Explore some more.  Find a crashed airplane.  Nothing really exciting in it, but there is a bunker right underneath.  I go in.  Looks like nobodys been here before.  There is an elevator, but It wont work.  I find a generator, but I have no fuel.  Ok..time to look for some fuel.  Search everywhere for miles and miles...finally find 3 yellow containers of gas.  I start running back to where the bunker was, but I'm lost now and its raining and I'm getting waaay too cold.  I find an old church.  I light a fire to get warm, but outside the window I see people running around.  Oh crap.  Then i see someone in the church.  I point my shotgun at him because he's holding an axe so he's obviously there to hurt me.  He asks if im friendly.  I dont trust him so I say nothing and just continue to point my gun at him.  Next thing I know I look over my shoulder behind me and there are 2 guys, both with axes, right on top of me.  I run and start shooting them because obviously if they were friendly, they wouldnt have weapons in their hands!  I take out all 3 of them, finish getting warm, and keep going on my journey.  As I leave the church, I see they were building a house.   Oh no!  What have I done?   They probably just wanted advice on how to build their little cabin.   Well, whats done is done.Back to my journey i find a map, get my bearings and head straight for the bunker avoiding any houses and stray dogs, but Im getting cold again, so I head to a house.  I see light and someone moving.  I'm careful and see this guy with a very powerful rifle going through some drawers.  He is fully geared and looks like someone I don't want to mess with.  He doesnt see me, but it wont be long before he does.  I pull out a pistol and start firing.  First shot, hes just like WTF?  I shoot again and he spots me, he looks like hes about to run, but the 3rd shot took him down.  I run in to check the house if there is anyone else there i need to kill.  I see 2 dead bodies with loot everywhere.  I grab all the guns/ammo/food/fuel I can use their fire to get warm and run.   At least this time I know I got an unfriendly.   I get to the bunker, ready to start up the generator...DOH...wrong type of fuel.  Now I have to go back out there into the dangerous unknown and hope I dont get shot.10/10Day 2I search long and hard and finally find some gas for the generator, but I walked far to get it.  Decided to look around and see if I couldnt find some more supplies.  I'm in luck, I find a car battery.  Maybe I can get in one of the many cars I've seen and drive back to the generator.  I'm still scouting around and hit the jackpot.  I find medicines, a very very large backpack, tons of ammo, weapons, ect.  I'm fully geared and ready to get in a car and drive myself back.  As I'm walking to a car, I hear a couple dogs bark.  No problem, I'm good at running past them.  But dead ahead I see several dogs coming at me.  I check to the side and they are coming at me from that direction.  No less than 8 dogs.  I drop my axe and pull out my pistol and kill 2 dogs and then my pistol clicks.  OH NO!  I forgot to reload with my last encounter.  I quickly try to reload as the dogs are on top of me.  I start firing, but there were too many of them and I couldnt reload fast enough.  They got me.			"

								My first playthough of this game:I wake up in a prison and walk around grabbing a bunch of empty weapon magazines that I don't know how to load with bullets and an axeI wander into a trainyard and suddenly my character becomes tattooed and looks like an overall badassI find some freshly spawned person and start visciously stabbing him behind his back. He turns around slowly, unsure of what was happening as if he was a newborn. He falls on the ground and drops no itemsI wander around the trainyard some more and I see a wolf approaching me, (which sounds oddly like a puppy rather than a wolf) I kill it with my axe and it drops a hunk of raw meatEventually I begin to get hungry, and I choose to eat the raw meat as there is nothing else around. My ears are suddenly assaulted with this extremely loud stock chomping sound effect, and then I am fullI wander around the trainyard even more, still finding nothing. Then I hear my character say ""my mouth is dry, I need something to drink"". Unfortunately there is no source of water anywhere nearby, so I keep movingMy character is now literally saying ""I'm thirsty"" ""My mouth is dry"" and ""Damn I really need something to drink"" about every 2 secondsI try and look for water, but I find none, and now my character begins including the phrase ""Damn I'm hungry"" into his continuous 2 second mantra of complaining that he is thirstyAbout 5 minutes later I find a building in another town and I run in looking for something to make my character shut the ♥♥♥♥ upI hear talking and a flashlight and out of pure desperation run to it hoping to kill him and take his food and waterI encounter a group of 3 fully geared men and they gun me down. For a brief moment, somewhere in the back of my mind, I thank themBut my misery does not end with my death, as my character's phrases ""Damn I need something to eat"" and ""Damn I'm thirsty"" glitch out and begin repeating over and over at the same time, overlapping and sounding like the voices of some circle of hellI close the game and walk away from my computer screen.It's a pretty good game			"

								I have to start out by saying i think this game has some potential to be a good game. I played for 3 hours and really want to like it. It is different. I got frustrated by having absolutely no instructions listed anywhere and no way to what keys did what. It literally took me until the third hour to learn how to load a gun. I think it is because I didn't have the right ammo for any of the guns that i found. I eventually found a shotgun and found some shells. and reload was ""R"". I thought i had the right shells for the gun I was carrying but the caliber was not listed on the gun and the caliber listed with the bullets and clips were listed differently than I am used to. so it was hard to identify when I had the right ammo for the pistol I had. Also when you find thing you cannot carry enough items. this was very frustraing. Water is hard to find so I hoarded that....food was fairly simple to find but sometimes I would have to carry a can opener which I didn't want to carry due to inventory space. You can die of starvation, hunger and hypothermia. You start off with 6 inventory slots If you find water then definitely take it. 1 slot used. Find another water....well definitely take that. 2 slots used. Find food......alright found a can......3 slots. Oh.....need a can opener....found one 4 slots used........I am getting cold. I need an axe.....well that is a weapon so it doesn't count in my slots...that's good so I chop a tree and got a piece of wood 5 slots but now I need a lighter and a can fuel to ingnite the wood. That's 7 slots!. I did eventually find a back pack which expanded to up to 12 slots but I write that out to describe the frustration I felt when I knew I was getting h8ungry and thirsty fast and needing tyo hoard things but having to drop them just to continue on. Then thinking I can just go back for them to find that it respawned withing minutes of me finding them. DANG! it's not there now I am screwed.....now I die......and I start over with nothing. I will try it again later and hope I will change my mind to give it a thumbs up. I certainly don't think I wasted my $5 because it is a really neat concept. I mostly wanted to offer feedback to the developers who seem to really be invested in making it a good game. IMHO......list some instructions like the basic key commands....it would have helped me out quite a bit. "

								Started out in a prison, thought ""huh this is interesting"" lockpicked my way out of my cell, exited through the sewer and ended up in a trainyard. Russian prison sewers end up in a trainyards? That seems like a bit of an oversight. I had not head or appendages to speak of, and i remember reading in a survival handbook that people can't see you when you are naked, so i did the only logical thing and stripped as naked as i could. I heared gunshots in the distance and decided to investigate.  I found three guys standing over a body, they were all speaking in Russian so i decided to practice some foreign diplomacy. I was halfway through apologizing in advance for my bad Russian, when one of them walked up to me and said ""you have seen too much"" and shot me in the head with a double barreled shotgun. I respawned in the same trainyard, got chased by screaming Russians, Americans, two wolves, and a bear for about two hours. I saw somebody commit murder suicide, three people die in a row because they thought a ladder was climbable (i think they were the Russians from before), a tractor used as a weapon of mass murder, countless cases of shotgun diplomacy, and a wooden skyscraper. This game is pretty amazing. It has awesome firefights, walkie-talkies, a better community than DayZ, Russians, and for the price of 5.99 USD or 5 Euros it can be yours. I honestly suggest this game to people who have 5.99 and nothing to do with it.			"

								My 30 minutes of playtime for this game was pretty bad.-First, you spawn in the middle of nowhere, with no tutorial, no basic supplies, no direction whatsoever with what you are ACTUALLY supposed to be doing with your life. -Within the first 5 minutes my character was already dying of thirst and starvation, with no food or water in sight. -If you have a confrontation with a.. wild dog, wolf, whatever it is, good luck. Especially since you can't even punch the darn thing since the only thing you can use are weapons, which are few far and in between. -I actually found the help menu, which shows what buttons to push to do what, but had to exit the game to actually find it. No in game help menu at all. -The inventory menu is complicated to use. Not to mention you only have 6 free slots to stash stuff. -The combat is choppy and just plain bad. -You run across more ammo than you do guns(should be the other way around)-When you actually do come across a gun, you can't tell if you have the right ammo for it anyways since none of it is written in english. Morale of the story, don't buy this game. It has potential, but unless they make some MAJOR changes, it would be the worst $5 I've ever spent.			"

								Ok I really think the game is very well put together as far as the looting goes. The only issue I have right now with my first couple playthroughs is the fact that hit detection on pvp is horrible. Its either that or hackers because there is no reason I should be hit by a guy with a bat that is no where near me. Also when I shoot someone in the head with a 44 magnum 5 times and they dont die but do die from a couple swings with a bat. I hope the game will fix these issues and put together some sort of base building			"

								Okay, i have to edit my review because the game has come across with many changes.Devs changed the original map back from the ''summer beta'' because they got so much negative feedback. So players who bought the game when the summer beta was on, dont stop playing this game ,its much better again :). But i really wanted to put this review as not recommended but only problem in this game are the hackers. You just cant get rid of them. Example, you kill a normal looking player with guns and stuff, he starts yelling russian swearwords, after 1 minute he spawns at the nearest spawnpoint and stands still for 30 seconds and suddenly he spawns m4 and he starts to chase you with infinte ammo on etc. and when he gets you killed he throws the m4 away and takes her stuff back and pretends nothing weird happened... so yeah thats what this game is nowadays.

								Unfortunately I'm not reccomending this game, though here's my review.Pros:Price $5 can't beat itSmooth gameplayCustomization is a plusMaps are easy to understandPossibly more good updates to comeCons:Much lag on almost every serverInability to find matching loot in some towns for weaponry, orjust the inability to know what bullets match what gun.Unable to see amount of ammunition in current weapon (that i know of)No guidance what so ever on craftingSmall maps make for almost no loot (or the loot is based upon whoever is looting as I've learned my friend can't see the gear I see so possibility that loot is clientsided unless dropped by a player.Unfriendly community as expected from a pvp game so that's sort of a pro makes it PVP friendly.Survival threats are very low, cold, food, water, wolfs /dogs and players. Not much else to die from in terms of survival ""postapocalypse now"" yeah.. not really apocalyptic either. Few broken down boats, a plane, and that's really it some broken buildings. Not really apocalyptic looking.Very boring after a few hours of gameplay due to very low population or inability to find loot.Much hackers, very wow, much boring.Wanna blow $5 on a game to♥♥♥♥♥♥around with? Perfect game, it's not bad just needs work (alot).			"

But first something about the gameplay, so I have all known Survival Games currently installed and must say that has managed PA Now to fight for his own place. It feels a bit like a mixture of Seven Days to Die and H1Z1 with the difference that you feel, I do not run forever until something happens but it comes from the first second to get going. Okay, the graphics are just not comparable with DAYZ and often affects the game still unfinished, but one must not forget that it is a beta, and that can change a lot up to the finished game yet. I think for my part for 5 €, go quickly on a server fight a bit, Loot what you can and wait for the next patch that is Postapocalypse ""NOW"" -> I hope it develops into a Postapocalypse ""WOW"". "

								Horrible. Absolutely horrible. It's like it was made by someone in high school over the course of a week. It's grotesquely ugly, sound effects are♥♥♥♥♥♥ even if you're crawling you still emit the same loud footsteps as if you're walking, the only difference is that they come with bigger intervals. I looked at the reviews and went ""Oh cool, this doesn't seem very generic at all besides the player base."" And boy, was I wrong. Literally everyone I met killed me on sight and the ones who didn't manage to kill me only didn't because I ran for my life. I never found more than 2 pistols in my whole playthrough, barely any melee weapons, no real supplies and scarce food. Most houses I visited were looted and the houses are very repetitive. The map feels like it's 100 meters across or something, the graphics, once again, are UTTERLY CRAP, all text in the game is just plan white arial in all-caps, the icons look like they're made in paint and then scaled up to the point of blurriness, when you die you can see all players on the map and where they are, everyone shoots each other on sight and for some reason there are dogs in the game that you can outrun extremely easily. I regret so much buying this, that's 5€ I could have done something useful for. The mere thought of launching this game depresses me. Please, please, please do not buy this until it becomes a GAME and not just a 5 minute Unity project for a class in high school which is exactly what it feels like.			"

								This game is worth buying.I find two revolvers in a big building on a bed and im having a look when suddenly shots fly around me into the wall.I run into cover and a man comes in and I fired all six revolver rounds into his torso and dropped it and picked back up my colt. The next guy comes in with a double barrel shot gun and misses both as I was not where he thought I was, once again dead.The third and last guy gets wise and tries to sneak around the back and shoot me through a window, I hear a wolf bark and attack him and three gunshots ring outside. I pick up the doublebarrel and lie down. After biding my time hhe grew impatent and wanted his mates' gear thinking I was gone came in and got two 12 guage slugs in his chest.10/10 would firefight again.			"

								Well...You basically spend five bucks to play a loot simulator and wolf hunting simulator and by the time you find any players, A. You dump every round you have into them just to be one tapped or, B. They kill you easily and speak Russian slurs to your corpse. Here is where the PVP leaves you bent over a table with a gag in your mouth. The report button you are given as you die is a for sure way to make sure you ban that kid that killed you or vise versa. So if I was you I would stick to killing wolves and gathering supply as killing will get you a for sure ban as the kid that you've just managed to kill is surely butt hurt and will report you. But seriously not a horrible start to a decent game has lots of potential to be the next big survival game, but as of now is (***IN-MY-OPINION***) a waste of five dollars.EDIT: And not to mention the fact that you can spectate every living player in the minute it takes to respawn so you campers and base builders and people seaking survival are all being watched, so removing the report button and option to spectate everyone would be a great start to building a stronger game.FEELINGS: Mixed			"

								So much potential. For a 5 dollar game it aint all bad. The gameplay is a bit wonky. Stats go down too fast, Loot system is akward, and meeting up with friends is a chore. Also there is no real threats besides the enviorment and players. Besides that it has a cool setting with a voiced character and runs very smoothly despite its huge map.

								My review:Playing only close to 2 hours of this game I have experienced more bugs than in my 500 hours on Infestation Survivor stories game time. This game is also not a poor mans DayZ. It has barely a quarter of content compared to DayZ. If you want a cheap version of DayZ simply go to the free to play tab on steam and download Unturned which is better in every way.Good points:- Easy to run and max out on any computer made in the last 10 years. (Could be due to the terrible texture quality in buildings and the fact that the game world is broke into different parts)- PVP is okay. (Worse than DayZ and ISS due to the terrible amount of motion blur when shot at.)- Interesting looting system. (mainly finding loot by opening different doors and cases.)Bad Points:- There is currently only 3 enemies in the game. (Wolves, Bears and other players)- The game has a terrible spawn system. (I spawned ontop of a wolf and took instant damage. I have also spawned into enemy territory in TDM)- Inventory system is awful and clunky.- You spawn with nothing to defend yourself including being unable to punch.- Wolves can noclip into buildings and are able to fly through doors.- Bears can instantly kill you.- Ragdoll system is bad, characters arms and legs seem to have no bones and clip through buildings.- There is no custom options at the main menu meaning you are not only unable to adjust graphics quality but also sound and key bindings.- The game also seems to ban people that have just brought the game for no reason. ( I heard that it bans US players)- The game has a capped FOV of maybe 60 give or take. You can not adjust this in the launcher.- You will be instantly disconnected if you press ESC meaning not only is it annoying but also people can log out in combat.- Hitboxes and weapon dmg is awful( I point blanked someone with a colt 1911 in the head and then repeatedly shot them in the body as they ran away. They lived. Blood was coming out of them too.)- Guns are completely unbalanced and are unreliable( I was 1 shotted across the street by a guy with a double barrel. Yet with the same gun It took me atleast 4 or 5 rounds to kill someone point blank with the same gun in a perfect condition.)			"

								Don't get this game. There are random bans that prevent some people from playing. I played for like ten minutes and then a cat in a jar showed up. If you see this, you were banned. There were a lot of hackers so they made it to where you can't play if you hack but the system is broken, causing random people to get banned.			"

This is dayZ, but without the price tag and extended menus. It's right under equivalent. The best part about it, is that there are only two enemies. Other people and wolves. There's no typing, so if you don't have a microphone, all and any other players are KoS. This game also has one menu. Your inventory. No guides for controls, this game doesn't hold your hand.			"

								you die of cold way too fast and no matter what clothes you have it still doesn't work in anyway and the graphics arnt much good along with the game play all you come across is wolfs with the same spawn areas as always along with other animals along with loot the loot system is terrible the food is easy too find and the guns are too and the gasoline is stupidly hard to find even though you find assault rifles and pistols along with shotguns the gasoiline is just stupidly hard to find your most likely going to die of cold if you don't find any and this only take like five too ten minutes to die of hypothermia.

								Well...You basically spend five bucks to play a loot simulator and wolf hunting simulator and by the time you find any players, A. You dump every round you have into them just to be one tapped or, B. They kill you easily and speak Russian slurs to your corpse. Here is where the PVP leaves you bent over a table with a gag in your mouth. The report button you are given as you die is a for sure way to make sure you ban that kid that killed you or vise versa. So if I was you I would stick to killing wolves and gathering supply as killing will get you a for sure ban as the kid that you've just managed to kill is surely butt hurt and will report you. But seriously not a horrible start to a decent game has lots of potential to be the next big survival game, but as of now is (***IN-MY-OPINION***) a waste of five dollars.EDIT: And not to mention the fact that you can spectate every living player in the minute it takes to respawn so you campers and base builders and people seaking survival are all being watched, so removing the report button and option to spectate everyone would be a great start to building a stronger game.FEELINGS: Mixed			"

								There's no fair play, no safe zone, no guidance or chance to explore the game. Just straight out pvp and brainless kill to survive. As I see nothing fun about the game, I rate this game as griefware. "

								Absolute waste of money! This game makes absolute NO fun!it's like ARMA2:DayZ and The Long Dark have a absolut ugly baby. plus Day One is the original father if it.- absolut crappy world design! if you like looting the same item 100 times again on the same building that you looted 20 meter before you are realy good with this, else not!- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay! this is PVP that it should not be. theoretically there is survival somewhere, but where? The enviroment is absolut no problem, then there is only PVP but what PVP?! to hit with a gun is absolut luck, the most fights are with baseballbat or fireaxe and this is so damn idiotic... no bleeding, no trauma, no nothing. hit HP go down and nothing more. this isn survival this is serious sam MMO- bad server performance.lags and long loading times between the maps are realy suxx♥♥♥♥♥br>- stupid unlogical loot systemeven if that game is Early Access, this crap should go in the dump. you can kill a player but not can take his cloths? why cant i take his backpack anywhy? why are there always cargos OUTside a building but no where inside? why are 99.99% off all closets empty? even if respawn would work...- respawn systems suxx as hell!YOu spawn mostly directly where you got ganked before. realy nice to die again with your lousy baseballbat...

Early Access Review
								EDIT: On 5th of April 2016 I decided to give this game another try, so I re-downloaded it and re-installed. And it actually worked a lot better. I could explore the world, wander about, find some nice equipment (hatchet, two types of gun) and even some tiny food rations. I even found like 5 dogs, who all died to my hatchet. But I could not find anything to drink at all, after searching like 15+ houses, some quite big houses (a school, a church, a saw mill). And only two pieces of food (one box of sardines and one chocolat). So I eventually starved / dehydrated. Not much to do yet, it seems. Game lagged a little at times, and maybe 15 times I experienced a nasty ""teleport"" bug - walking on the road or next to a house, and then instantly re-appearing somewhere else where I was like 3-5 minutes ago. It felt like that movie ""The Ground-Hog Day"", or maybe like a ""Goldfish-memory Simulator 2016"". And then I experienced a major crash bug that made my computer freeze so much it needed a restart. So I would not change my recommendation to a recommend yet, since it is quite buggy and not fun nor good enough to play for more than say 30-45 minutes yet, but it is improving. So given some more series of improvements, it may soon be worth a try as a game. Original review: Stay away from this one. Buggy, laggy, not working properly in My computer.			"

I am a DayZ Vet so i understand this concept but why do we need another game like DayZ with less in it? I do enjoy the game i just feel there is not much to do other then what i said..Please don't comment its 'Early Access noob' Read the description the dev said its nearly finished.. I will continue to play then game only when i am very bored :) I don't know if i should thumbs up or down as it could be the entended result for the game but yeah.. you decide, It is like 4 pound so i'm not to fussed lol			"

								( If you are deciding to buy then read this ) First of all get the game if you like russians,big firefights, and mass murder by wolves and tractors. Game is fun, but from my experience it is also posessed by a ghost.  At first the game seems small but there are actually many maps.  Me and my friend were traveling from map to map finding many things, and doing well.  We eventually came to a point were we were scarce of food and water.  We decided to shoot eachother with our guns to end the misery, but we searched around a little more to see if there was hope left.  Btw, we were at a point were we saw no players. We eventually found a crashed plane and we deicde to search it. The dark travel screen came up that you get when you travel from map to map.  Me and my friend were quickly horrified as we enetered the area the plane seemed to turn into  a dark underground vault, where it was very creepy, it was like nothing else in the game.  Me and my friend were confused and scared so we exited the area and reneted.  On the second time we entered we found a man who was not there standingf there before, we shot him.  We exited again and went back in for the third time.  I quickly realised something was wrong as my friend was there a second ago, but now he wasnt.  We talked over skype about what was happeneing.  While i roamed the creepy room all of  a sudden in a blink of an eye i was in another room.  This room was creepy and dark and the floor was filled a ft. high with water.  What made the experience worse was i wasnt  alone in this new room, the same man we shot before was in the room was there too, so i bolted int a big room in the middle and ran into some sort of closet and hid. I then died of freezing to death and lost all my stuff including my gas mask,rifle,shot gun, and all my cool clothes.  While i was waiting to respawn, i saw the water splash next to my dead body, as i respawn i was scared to find my slef spawn in the dark water room again.  I quit scared out of my mind.  My friend died in the other dark room but trace back to his dead body.  i hope this was just a glitch because now im stuck in a dark room forever with a ghost.10/10 would play crapping myself at 3:00 in the morning simulator again.All in all the game has its fun moments, but  can the game creators respond and tell me if the ""water"" room is supposed to be there. Day 1:I manned up and searched the water room.  It is literally the maze of hell.  I am stuck wandering the maze.  Pls send more russians with shotguns for backup. Day 2: I heard breathing, i got paranoid but it was my own...few.Day 3: I am currently going to keep writing logs until im saved, if you buy this, search for the crashed airline plane and help.Btw these arent actually days these are really just minutes.Day 4: I found an elevator! Im saved thank god!  But still, something was down there with me...But yay im out			"

								Great game, although it is a game that needs something more! One of the best games i've ever played but there are a few issues that come with a game of this magnitude, the bad FPS is one example. There is one thing that i feel this game really needs, and I'm pretty sure a lot of people agree with me on this, it needs a multiplayer feature!!All and all, I would rate this game a 7/10, 10/10 with the multiplayer!

								How do people like this game, guns don't work 1 second you have a full magazine, you fire, it's gone. Melee is too powerful 1 shot its better to use to over a gun. The lag is terrible, the map is just copied over and over only a hand full of unique buildings. Loot is everywhere or no where and i mean that literally, it's either guns and ammo on every shelf or none in a whole town. There is a killcam where you get to see everyone on the server what is this Call Of Duty, you spawn inside other people. Kill trading is more common than on the BF4 release day. Overall ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game not worth the $4 to $5.			"

								This game is kinda like dating a fat chick...you're having an o.k time,you know you can do better,and you may or may not tell your friends about it....I'll start off by saying thi title isnt ""bad"" however at first part of me felt like I wasted 6 bucks that  I could have blown on something more useful, perhaps a roach catcher or pet rock?The damn dogs will follow you to ♥♥♥♥ing middle earth, and back again!I get that in real life dogs are pretty great hunters but when you make the playable character unable to punch,kick,headbutt or even urinate in fear without a melee weapon, the fight is EXTREMELY one sided...Another thing that grinds my metaphorical gears,is for the last 15 mintes prior to writing this review my character kept repeatedly declaring ""♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ i'm hungry and ""damn i'm thirsty"" all the while running from 3 super dogs who never ran out of staminia.Other new found grievences are a few of the bloodthirsty Russians who with a well constructed group effort decided to repeatdly kill me,teabag my corps and would go hide in the factory and soak in a kiddy pool of vodka while they prepare for their next ambush...lolI do not understand the construct of this mentality for these types of games,I understand fully it's a ""survival"" game but what fun is it to just murder people and pay special attention to the newbies as it not only stifles the community but let's face it I wish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥gary would just stay on the DAYZ servers...The store page mentioned LOADS of vehicles and guns and clothing...So far ive found a chocolate bar,a torch,2 handguns, pants that look like they were dropped by Lady GAGA,and a flamboyant high collar shirt so my character looked more like he was going to break out in song and dance than kill you,,,I must admit though I am excited about finding a helicopter and some sweet weaponry.Don't get me wrong,I really think this game has some awesome potential and it has a few pockets of awesomeness waiting to be tapped into. WIth a little more work and refining I truly believe these game can do something great and present it it a more simplistic affordable way.A few things in my humble opinion that I hope the creators will see:* refining the dogs A.I (Love the idea when it comes to making this game more ""survival"" but either redo the A.I or make a Michael Vick NPC to control how many dogs are roaming out there..)*I feel the same way about the bears,as the dogs...(redo the A.I or add a bear whisperer skill) lol*ADD MORE GUNS and when your done.....ADD MORE!  :)* Consider a way to bring more balance among players.. (base building,Tribes/Guild whatever you want to call it, but make an inscentive for people to work together some rather than everyone and everything is your enemy)*Incorperate more customization and a more intuitive tutorial/help screen ( this games controls are straight forward but a little more of an in depth guide (in game) would be nice.* MELEE! any unarmed defense  (The force,Fistycuffs,karate chops,hell kicks) it doesn't matter...im just tired of being mauld by the viscious wildlife and going down without a fight.I really appreciate what you all are doing, its easy for me to sit here and pick the game apart but I can't imagine what goes into something like this and for you all to make it affordable during its production..I want to get people onboard in spite of my levity in my review I CAN SEE THE POTENTIAL! KEEP IT UP!Thanks for reading and until next time,ive got a score to settle with scooby and his little mutt friends!-Shaddock			"

								Alright I haven't done any reviews in a long time so I decided to do one for this game. First of all the game for what you're paying ($5.99) is worth it. I see the game with a bright future but there is just things on it that will annoy anyone at this point. It's really hard for me and buddies to find any drinks like literally impossible. Took me 2hours to find a shotgun and just to end up dieing by a glitching wolf, but hey It's on early access It's understandable... So yeah just letting yall know If it's worth it or not. For me it's worth the money. You may never know If the prices go up when It's out of early access.			"

								There are bad reviews of this game but I really like playing it. Its easy to find guns and food, but there are some flaws for example you randomly get tped to places and it sometimes glitches you to where you cant move but all you have to do is exit the game and join back and its fine. Aside from that I see nothing wrong with the game.			"

								Don't buy at this stage unless its under $10.00 , whilst fun it feels unfinished and unbalanced, however given this is early build its understandable.Pros :- Mostly complete game- Weapons are as expected in real life ( no head shot no damage RNG BS ) - Controls are fairly easy to use - Somewhat fun Cons : - You start the game unarmed, and you don't know how to punch or kick- Due to the above advanced players will camp your spawn points, as its safer to kill you than other well setup players- Nothing is explained before starting the game - Very easy to die of thirst, except its not logical, see empty bottles lying around, can you refill it ? , nope, drink a plastic bottle of water and the bottle vanishes- My system is fine , but it could chug on some machines- Not sure if everyone has this but my game had missing options from start menuMy review could change out of early testing , but at this stage stay away unless your wanting to put up with a fair amount of spawn killing and no real objective other than "" collect crap kill players ""			"

								I would have recommended this game an hour ago, but then I logged off and got shown a picture of a cat in a jar. Now every time I log off, I lose everything. All my items, all my progress. All of it doesn't stay. I just keep getting shown a cat in a jar every time I log off and I have to press Alt+F4 to quit.I don't know the reason for this, some are saying it's a ban, some say it's a bug. Whatever the reason, until this error gets fixed, this makes the game unplayable.EDIT: After trying again 48 hours later, my problem appears to be fixed. I'm still a little miffed it happened and want whatever happened to be resolved permanently, but it's working now and that's all that matters to me. Game is now recommended.			"

								I wouldnt even waste a penny on this game. Horrible, absolutely horrible. First off there is no tutorial so you basically are put into the game and you have no clue what to do. Second there is no loot anywhere except for the occasional can of beans. The graphics are worse than the original gameboy graphics. And last but not least you cant walk 10 yards without someone trying to kill you and you cant even talk to anyone. I just have one question for the game makers, What are you even supossed to do in this game? I highly recommend that you dont waste your money on this.			"

								At best, this is DayZ for someone who is unable to actually run DayZ on their computer. I'm not gonna' lie and say this game doesn't have potential, but it just really isn't fun. The graphics are just depressing to look at and the game is basically dead now anyway, the only people that still play are either spawnkillers, russians, hackers, or a beautiful combination of all three. I played this with two other friends and it wasn't really even that fun, we just spent our time being chased by bears that for some reason were ONLY CLIENTSIDE VIEWABLE so my friend who had a loaded gun could not help me as I was being mauled by a bear because the devs decided for each player's view to be different. This game is nowhere near completed, but the devs seem to think otherwise due to the recent push into beta.As of now, the best I can do is a 3/10, and even that is pushing it.			"

My first hour: Saved someone from Coyotes and left a Russian kid on the ground with two 12 gauge rounds in his face.Second hour: ScavengingThird hour: More scavengingThe rest: SCAVENGINGFor an alpha, this is good for $5.Buy this game, but remember, if I see you out there, you will meet my shotgun.

								With this new update they have recently release, I have decided to update my review on Survival: Postapocalypse Now.Now as I start out my review, this is my personal opinion on the game I know the game isn't great and yes it is in Early Access.Pros:-Has some interesting features I have not seen in other survival games.-Has some decent combat (not the best)-There are no generic zombies.-The starting zone in the jail is a really good idea I think, it is pretty creative and I have not seen this in any other of the survival games I have played.-Look at the cute ban screen :)Cons:-The Graphics are not the best, But they are alright and bearable.-The Game is unoptimized and you are garunteed fps drops while playing this game.- The wolves/dogs are not the best and have some issues about them, like walking through walls continue walking after death.-I have had alot of issues with the temperature in this game and find myself dying of cold no matter what.-Some items are not in english, this is an okay thing since the game is made by russains so if they haven't fully translated stuff thats cool there is probably also mods to fix thisOverall: 7.5/10Note: There is other survival games worth off gettings, but this game does not require much to run and does have the potential to become alot better.

He is spamming that he is hungry and thirsty while you are trying to figure out WTF is going on in the game. I found a gun, some ammo, a map and die of starvation and lose all I have looted only to be spawned god knows where, I dont know where I am going, There is no in game map or map funtions or a compass.

								Good game i played it for a little while it doesn't really explain anything and the wolves are just rediculous every building i went to there was wolves i got killed many times from wolves. When i finaly found a gun i did not have no ammo i had quite a bit of food but no weapons i turnt around started walking to the exit guess what....... Wolves atacked me. i found a guy standing on a desk and i tried to help him by leading the wolves away but it turns out he saw me come into the building he pulled out a gun shot the wolves then shot me. I still don't get why you can't punch the wolves and the player saying constantly ""I'm thirsty, i need a drink"" and ""*Breathing wierdly"" Im c...c.....cold"" it went on for ages i was like "" I CANT MAKE A FIRE I CANT FIND ANY WOOD NOW SHUT UP"". Yeah its pretty good but they should explain the players situation more*Spoiler alert* you just get thrown into a prison not knowing nothing, then all of a sudden you are in a cold area with a great big bear in front of you and a stupid week russian guy that keeps moaning he is cold. but other than that its good and i would recomend it to any of you guys that like hard crafting Postapocalyptic games where you can get bitten by wolves through solid metal doors!. Thats all im gonna say have a good time and try not to break your computer in frustration			"

For 5 dollars this is a very good game(if not the best for 5 dollars) that focuses on surviving.This game also has updates weekly/monthly.This game is also perfect for playing with friends and solo playing.

								Survival: Postapocalypse Now is an early acces Alpha FPS survival game, it has no campaign but a funny, adventurous and sometimes exciting multiplayer-survaval game mode. Although it costs us a little, as far as I'm concerned, it is not too much for the content of the game. In addition to in-game features, sometimes players will have to face challenges from the environment itself and other players, prudence will be your key and best friend to survive with.In this game, you will find more developped materials, resources and weapons by moving further and further away, you can still stay where you were when you have spawned, but my suggestion will be to advance, get fully equipped and packed with enough food and other raw materials. In this game, you can even make a helicopter fly or driving cars and jeeps.I also strongly recommend you to play this game with friends, it will be really funny and interesting to play with more players than just alone. It will be much easier to survive since you find different materials in different places, for example: you might find an AK-47 on a table while your teamnate can see just a bottle of water on the same table. You will get more chance to find rare items and will find it easier to survive. You can also kill the players then grab their items, which is more easily than gather them slowly but surely.P.S: there are no zombies in this game, so if you get into a dark area you don't need to be afraid.^^Positive remarks+ multiplayer mode+ very interesting and funny to play with friends+ difficulty improved each time you go towards a new map+ challenging to survive with some enemy players+ wide range of weapons and resources+ only 2 kinds of animals will attack you: wolves(dogs?) and bears+ new ways to survive ( cooking )+ vehicles + dynamite+ quick updates from the GM+ different features and functions on clothesNegative remarks- sometimes severe bugs will occur (ex: you spawn on the sky and die by falling on the ground)- animals (that are offensive) spawn always at the same place, less challenging- only a few maps to discover- hackers- temperature issues for survival decreases a little bit too quickly- at first, players spawn in a prison and can die right away if you don't get out quickly enough, especially to beginners- weapon switching system is a bit strange			"

								This game needs a lot of improvement. But, It does have some Pros.Pros:Pretty good way of actually starting your survival. (Trying to escape the prison you woke up in)Pretty cheap survival game.Somewhat realistic.Weather can actually kill you.No hackers. (YET)Now... lets go to the cons.Cons:Grahpics are a little bad.You can't even change grahpic settings nor any settings.No way of typing so people without mics can really communicate.Teleports. (You can walk to a certain area and get teleported to another part of a map, I think thats a little annoying, making the map bigger to make that all fit would be good and much better)Crafting is a little annoying to use.Wolves and bears spawn the exact same place everytime.You spawn with your stuff from another server.No way to make your own server.Crouching makes you go through this procces; Crouch then Prone then stand back up. You can just go back to standing.You can fall from 2 feet and get injured.The community is already going bad. (People are just killing on sight and people are just roasting each other)Base building is really that good. (People are just building in already generated buildings and they claim it as their own)The only people I ever saw playing this game were Russians. You already know what Russians do in CS:GO.... Don't need to explain.If you want to play a cheap survival game when you are bored this is the game. I don't recommend putting hours and hours of gameplay on this because this game isn't finished and you'll probably die by falling or a Russian on the server killing you.			"

All we need are - Volume options ( So I can hear friends over the thunderstorms that occur every 5 minutes / loud cars / other players chatting )- Loot fixes ( Loot items appear differently on player screens ) i.e.: Search a house for items > You may find a food item in a compartment > Friend of yours finds weapon instead of food item in same compartment- Maybe even #SnakePeople ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)Besides that, this game is really fun with Friends ...

								There seems to be potential here, however as of right now it is lacking enough quality to validate a purchase in my opinion. An example I have had is: Not being able to walk up certain stairs without the use of jumping. Another example is that there is no tutorial so you are left on your own as to figuring out how to use items from your inventory. There were a few cases of over lap in the audio along with rubber-banding in the prison cell. (This was an easy fix however when I changed servers). The respawn timer is a bit high, but this is just a nit pick. The variety in the environment is lacking as well.I can see this maybe being good in the long run with a few patches.The positives: Decent price at $6.00Combat seemed ok?...however there are tons of improvments that can be madeTons of potential if the developers can grasp onto it			"

								I don't know why there is so many reports of hackers, I have not run into a single hacker. I have not played much but it is a really fun game to get together with friends and try to survive against the burdensome cold, hunger, and thirst system. Trying hard to scavenge for ammo, clothes, food, drinks, and once you get to it GOOD GUNS. The looting system is a bit odd, but hey, early access, cannot expect much. Over all, $5, GREAT GAME. TOTALLY worth it.			"

								its a shame theres so many bugs and things that need to be fixed on this game. its such a diverse world that i believe is really fun to explore, especially with friends. there are way to many bugs though. for example, i am currently stuck on a black screen when travelling from the marsh to another area. also, without a torch,l it is almost impossile to see when its night time and your scavenging. the game has a lot of potential, but unfortunatly a lot of bugs. they will hopefully be sorted in the next couple of patches. For only $4 however, i would deffinetly buy it becasue it is the cheaper version of any other survival game which are always so over priced.			"

								2016 full review edit / change to not recommended...: I can't recommend this game anymore. It's very glitchy, no one plays anymore (30 people across multiple servers, if that.) and the devs have abandoned the game to work on their next project. Postapocalypse Now: War. Here's just a few glitches / annoyances.Animals (bears, wolves) spotting you from half way across the map.Animals never ceasing to stop chasing you. If you somehow break their pathing (climb on a ladder, close a door) they will sit there and wait for you forever.Weapons are always unloaded. No ammo, no clips or magazines, nothing. Finding guns is arguable the most common. Finding literally anything useful is a test of patience.You're constantly freezing to death. To stay warm you need an axe to cut down a tree and get wood, fuel to soak the wood and a lighter to burn it. That wouldn't be so bad if you weren't CONSTANTLY. FREEZING. TO DEATH.You start out at about 37 or so degrees celcius. Celcius. That's 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.You will freeze to death and die at about 25 celcius. THAT'S  77 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. YOU DIE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. IN THE MIDDLE OF SIBERIA. NAKED.This upsets me the most, because food and water are managable, but god help you if you don't find the tools for a fire. R.I.P. Dmitry. Got slightly too cool and died.You're completely defenseless most of the time. You find a gun? Good for you, it will never have ammo and good luck finding any. Pray you find a melee weapon.Their newest ""alpha"" version of the game is literally an unplayable mess, it was somehow more broken than their older version. Like, broken to the point where your mouse didn't work when you tried to play it.It had a lot of squandered potential, and it was actually a lot of fun when hundreds of people played, devs were still working on the game and you had someone to play with despite it being glitchy. The last ""update"" was in March, with the ungodly terrible alpha update.Don't buy this game, it doesn't seem to be getting any better from here.			"

Why? They made playable ""beta"" version which I played for about 20 hours. But then they probably thought ""Hey, lets make new version of this game with better graphics and other improvements"". And you know what? They f****d up. New ""alpha"" is terrible, full of bugs, containing 3-4 maps full of emptiness, bugged wolves/dogs, and objects with boring, grey-brown textures. They added achievements! In russian of course... Now here's the crazy thing right now.They added new game on Steam Greenlight. Which looks like this game. Why...? Dear developers - finish this game before making new one.You made playable, pretty nice game in ""beta"" (old survival), so why can't you continue making it?

								This game has good consistency behind it, however it is now abandoned by the developers, and will remain in it's state for a long time. I have attempted to give this game a chance to change, and the developers have had plenty of time to do it, but since this game is always going to remain in a broken state, I have been provoked to not recommend this game.  For example; the jumping physics in the game are absolute rubbish, forcing you to die, even if you jump from a little height.   However, do not take my word 100% for this game, you may really enjoy it, but I do recommend that you play with friends, it helps. Trust me.			"

Yes, there are going to be glitches!Some people are also saying that you get thirsty to fast, it makes it challenging, im always on the edge of my seat when I play this. I do reccomend that you can use your fists to fight, so when you begin its a bit easier, I died 9 times when I started because of lack  of weapon, and also in your inventory ""thirsty"" is spelled ""thristy"".Similar to H1Z1 and DayZ, but instead of zombies, its a fight for hunger, and wolves, and bears!Also VERY good graphics and it runs smoothly, even with all visual settings all the way up!Looking for a cheap, but good game?

								first off im going into depth with this reveiew. so you all know this game looks fun and it is to a certan point i recommend this game cause it is fun to a certan point and you still have to consider that this game is in early access and it shows a lot of promise ill get into my thoughts now as a 70 something hour player of this game ive done about everything you can do in this game ive had alot of bugs and a lot of fun but ill get into the bugs the ones i hate most are 1. when you get to the army base from going threw the marsh you cant go back threw the marsh to get back to the part of the map before it it just goes black screen and you cant do anything another one is some times you will find something good like a good weapon if you drop a weaker weapon then try to pick that one up sometimes it will cause you to pick up the old weapon and the good weapon will be gone the pros of this game are its fun its also challanging which is a good concept in games like this you dont want it to be to easy or it wont be any fun also i like the building system but if you could put locked doors and maybe have severs that save so if you build a massive fort like me and my freind built around the school it dosent just disapear and maybe different matirials that you can use to build with and maybe latters that you can climb towers instead of having such a problem with trying to get the ramps to line up also if you could add frequenceys to the radio so that freinds cant be heard while planning an attack and maybe if you add different material building then you could have different ways to destroy each kind of building and if you could make it eaiser to make the bomb like scatter the parts in different part of the maps and maybe add a trading station farther in the distant future where there is a safe zone where you can trade and maybe add a curency system but i could go on forever i think this will do but if you need to contact me even if your a player that needs to know how this game is let me know on this profile ill talk to you guys later peace.

And about the microtransactions, it was really easy to find weapons so the players that spent money in the game wouldn't have advantages. It's 2016, I have more than a 1000 hours in the game.Finnaly the steam version launched and we didn't really care.Soem onths later we decided to go to steam and see what's new about the steam version we looked at the community hub and there was a bunch of cool vehicles and etc, and we thought that the game was really cool so we decided to buy it.First day of playing the game, me and my friend took 1 hour and 30 minutes to find each other, then another hour goes by and we find one player who had a shotgun, we tried to communicate with him and he started shooting us, he missed all the shots and i shot him one time in the head i killed him, pretty use kill, i was already used to shooting in survival.So now i have 13hours of gameplay and i gotta say,the game has a LOT of potential but, right there's alot of bugs and gamebreaking problems, almost nobody playing and I  can understand why.So i recommend you to play the facebook version instead, you'll have alot more fun.If you have 5 bux to spare and want to support the devs it's your choice.I keep looking forward to this game, and i hope this review helps.

								I love this game, and for $5 it couldn't be a better price. Don't let the silly name fool you, this is a much more playable game than most of the current survival games. The game is mostly like a mix between STALKER and DayZ, just without terrible movement, weapon handling, and all the bugs. The game could use some more content as in new locations, weapons, sounds, and enemies, but currently the game is definitely fine as it is.			"

								Ok, Im gonna start of with saying that you can get this game for free, as it is a free2play facebook game.But dont get me wrong, this game is like a ""poor man's DayZ"" which means that for the pricetag of 5 dollars i would definitely recomend it.I still have to warn you, the graphics of the game Ain't exactly visually appealing, but if you look past these flaws i think you'll get your moneys worth.As of the Pros and Cons:Cons:- Outdated graphics- Somewhat buggy gameplay- Low lootspawns- somewhat laggy hitboxesPros:- Good atmosphere. (you'll feel lonely as a solo surivor)- well made survival system. (hunger, Thirst and body temperature.)- A good variety of weapons, foodstuffs and clothing. (if you can find any.)For a survival-game enthusiast like myself, this could be worth more than 5 bucks.7/10			"

								           So far I've only played this game for 2 hrs, but it was definitly one of the most intresting expirences I've had. First I spawn shirtless like any normal russian would (right?) near some shack, so I seach around until a dog scares the sh*t out of me and I run for about five minutes until I meet my first fellow player. He was dressed in green and armed with a shotgun so I decide to stay back and watch due to me being KOS'ed countless times in other games like it, he leaves and I find an ugly blue sweater, my first loot item and it probably saved others from being stabbed by my undoubtly pointy nips. It's been about an hour and I also just found a 357 and 5 bullets for it too, a few minutes later a innocent looking shirtless man just charges at me with an axe and I nervously spray bullets all over the place and lucky he gets hit by one or two and it kills him. So, as I strut off like a bad*ss Clint Eastwood I hear barking it's about 5 wolves coming for me I some how manage to slay all of them with an axe and limp away, I hide in a factory building and just as I turn around another corner to see one more I get bit and die. I'm not angry in fact I'm almost in tears from laughter that I survived off of luck for so long survived a godamn axe attack! Just to be murdered by some wolf. Anyways my verdict is that this game has a good start and hopefully the devs will follow through. 10/10 would get wolf♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again			"

								Stay away from the schol if you don't have a weapon, unless  your life aspirations are to become wolf food, and expect to have a slow and painful death from dehydration because besides living in a snowy wonderland with lakes all around, it is near impossible to find a sustainable water supply. I need more Juice dammit! other than that the game is great fun for the price, I managed to find a shotgun and enough ammunation to deplete the Russian population. The game is simple to learn and a good fun if you can find someone who doesn't whisper sweet nothings into your ear as you loot an abandonded building together, I must also say this game is very tense when you are caught in a gun fight with someone, you don't alway know where they are and must track them via their footsteps or gunshots (You can actually see them it's just easy to lose sight of them) my best moment so far has been dispatching some poor bloke with one swift axe swipe and watching his corpse become a pretzel			"

								Found a house, went inside and encountered a fully kitted man.  Stared down the barrel of his shotgun.  He kept his sights on me for 20 seconds then let me go.  Found a shotgun, followed him outside and shot him.  No Russian.Honestly though, this game is pretty great.  I was able to find a shotgun, backpack, pistol and plenty of ammo, as well as some food within 20 minutes, whereas in Dayz or H1Z1, the chances of having all of those in 20 minutes are slim to none.  I don't like the cold mechanic all that much though, even wearing a heavy jacket and pants my cold increases steadily.			"

								A few things picked up:Axes (you need them to get wood to build a fire) can be found in lockers and the ""very small"" bottom drawers of wardrobes.If you hear a wolf/dog close, yes it is hunting you.The Fly Eastern Airplane crash site has a secret base under it. Looks like you need ""at least"" gasoline to get the elevator running.Churches appear to be good places to find ammo (go figure)pick a server with the time after 6/7hr for daylight.Don't go to the MARSH you might get stuck there with the ""Black screen"" of death.If you get the black screen of death where it does not load the next map, exit, get back in (because you can not see your menu to do the following), then suicide, wait the 1 min, do not respawn but press Alt-F4, and then close the game. When you restart you'll be in the prison but at least you wont' be trapped anymore.

								Well after begging quite awhile for an 'Invert Mouse' option, here's my promised negative review. I see the latest update has all kinds of nifty goodies like helecopters, lockpicking and developer nosepicking.  I and many others have waited patiently, but the devs for this game are more interested in making kewl beards and gun models. They have no interest in making a serious control issue top priority.  AS AN INVERTED-MOUSE-CHALLENGED GAMER I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO BE ABUSED BY RUSSIAN PLAYERS TOO!!  Otherwise, neat game.  C'mon devs, get this taken care of.  This is ridiculous.			"

This game, is literaly just running around doing nothing, on top of this I only saw one guy, and guess what he was doing? Running around doing nothing. There is no tactics to this game world. You may be lucky to find something, but whatever you find is purely luck, nothing more. These reviews must be fake or something because its the worst game I've played.			"

								As someone who plays DayZ and recently started playing H1Z1, I don't know if this game is worth $5.  I almost died of thirst during the first playthrough with nothing to drink in sight.  I had acquired tons of food, but nothing to drink.  All the controls mentioned when you first start the game aren't all the controls, but you wouldn't know that.  No way to check the controls once you already start the game from what I could tell.  I then played through again and got stuck on top of a rail in a train depot or some building and had to suicide.So, I tried a 3rd time and my character kept respawning in random locations and there was no way I could manage to play properly.  This game has some potentional, but needs some serious bug fixes.  Until then, I cannot recommend this game.  Even at $5.  Bummer!P.S. I understand this is an early access game, but this pales in comparison to other early access games I've played.			"

								What was originally a very nice indie game with a ton of potential is now an abandoned game which now has an average player base of 15 - 30, which are mostly Russians. Which obviously sucks if you live in the North America, where the servers are dead. The devs have almost literally abandoned this game, just look at the almost nonexistent patch notes. Don't buy this game. Owners should be gien the option to take a refund. ♥♥♥♥, this game had so much potenial.			"

								This is a nice game for its price. But before you buy you should know the developers abandoned the game. That means no more updates. This game has loot spawn inbalances and weapons are hard to use and find. But for $5 its a pretty good game. If you play during the day when there are more players you will definitely have some interactions with them. Most will be fights because nobody uses their mic. But overall it is realistic and fun.

								This game is a train wreck.. when i first got it i thought it had potential... but update after update nothing has changed.. plus too add they scrapped a bunch of updates that were decent and went back to the game from half a year ago...there is no end point too the game.. its just respawn find some stuff and then get killed... there building system barely gets used because no one can survive long enough to use it... you cannot play offline.. and if you try too you'll end up in a loading screen that cannot be exited.... I wish i could get a refund			"

								As long as they keep it like this and add what they said they would (more animals, newspapers, and maybe but not likely a singleplayer campaign type of thing), I think they could fix what they ruined with that Prison update.  And the dude that is saying this game is abandoned:For those, who like to spread panic.Survival: Postapocalypse Now is in development. It WAS abandoned for some time in the reason of some problems with the project in common.Survival Wars will be Free to Play game.Please, stop the panic. We're here and still working. Both games will be finished and released.Best regards, TB Games.This game isn't abandoned, just buy it, I cannot say ""you won't regret it"", because if I see one more  Steamless world update.....but, just buy it. It's not that bad, it's relatively fun.			"

								Huhhhhh were do i begin....... well first of all theres only a limited amount of things to do for example: you wake up in a prison cell wondering what happened so you find a way out. after that u realise that your hungry and thirsty so u look for supplies. WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN U DIE FROM ANOTHER PLAYER WHO HAS SNUCKIN UP BEHIND YOU! you respawn and decide to do the exact same thing when all of a sudden U DIE AGAIN! once again from another player. rinse and repeat: boy wouldnt you like to read a story where the main character dies and respawns over again and again and again and again and again and again. now sometimes it isnt a player its a pack of wolf or a bear.sometimes you will die from hungar or starvation but really u get 5 ways of dieing. -_-			"

								It is hard to get too picky with this game because of the price point.  However, I think it just tries to do a bit too much and misses out on some of the major important things.  I think most of the time you just spend a lot of time trying to get set up and then you just die because everyone kills on sight.  The maps are way too big and it is impossible to actually meet up with your friend.  It pretty much just ends up being a walking simulator and you can never find all the supplies to make a fire so you just freeze to death.			"

								I was freezing to death, desperately searching a cabin for anything to help me warm up. All of a sudden two voices came over my walkie-talkie, speaking a language I don't understand. I was in no condition to fight them, and if I fled that would give away my position. So, I took the only other option available. I ran out of the cabin and went prone in the bushes, my pistol out and ready. My eyes and ears were open wide. They continued to talk. I was sweating. I heard footsteps from within the cabin, two distinct sets. They were close. I couldn't see through the brush which concealed me. After what felt like an agonizing eternity passed. The voices stopped. I had no way of knowing if they were gone, or had simply ceased talking. I bolted, running through the woods to get away. A few minutes later I died of hypothermia like a true Russian. 10/10 would hide again.			"

								i feel that the cars should work properly and the charecture should be warm when they have cloths on like a coat if their in just a pair of pants then that would make sens and the funny thing i find is when it rains you should be able to tilt ur head up to get a drink or use a can to gather water or gather snow to drink and when your inside a house it should bring up ur heat a little and u should have a way to use the wepons in the inventory like you should be able to have more then one gun in ur inventory and the dogs should have a limite to how far they run befor they should give up and gas should be a little easyer to find and the building a fire is dificolt i cant figure it out to save my life u should have it to were u should have two stick to creat a fire because ik for a fact that i can make a fire with two sticks and some tender and the gravity fisicks suck u   fall way to quickly and i also have a picture of one of the tractores going hay wire ill send it in a bit but athore than a cupple ishues i cant wait to see what it can become deffinetly recommend it to some friends			"

								I think this game could be better than DayZ in the future!It has a lot of potential an is  in opposite to other games totally inexpensive.This game also is not based on killing each otheran that is the main positive aspect for me.The player have to defend against animals as well.In my opinion the whole looting system is fantastic.The player must decide which things he needs mostbecause his inventory is limited (could be upgraded by wearing a backpack).Also the fact weapons need different ammo is very realistic.All in all ""Survival: Postapocalypse Now"" is worth to buy!

								I understand this game is early access, but until problems are fixed, I cannot reccomend this game, it doesn't mean I didn't have fun however.Here's a major problem I had with the game...I can't play it anymore, when ever I load into a server, it just goes into a blackscreen, thats it. I changed servers and there are no changed. I'll give it a couple days, hopefully this bug will patched, or I'll need to uninstall the game and wait till it goes full release.And no some more minor problems I had with the game...-Animals don't stop chasing you for♥♥♥♥♥♥ I mean seriously, I look at a dog or a bear from across the field and I♥♥♥♥♥♥it off so badly, it won't stop chasing me till the ends of the Earth. It'd be nice if animals stopped chasing you at some point. Once I have a ton of dogs chasing me, I just give up and let them kill me.-Character Customization? What Character Customization? I understand it's an upcoming feature, but don't advertise the feature till it's available.-This is just personal, but the models and animations are derpy like hell, but I don't hold it against ya guys, at least you're trying and we're not playing as potatoe people.-Each map is just too empty... I mea this once school place, it's just a school, a gas station, and a couple buildings, that's it. It makes it very hard to gather supplies.-Why can't I beat the crap out of people with my fists? I'm surprised the most common form of combat wasn't included.-Why can I only climb some ladders? Some ladders are climbable, but others aren't.-A pause mention would be nice so you can adjust stuff like volume. Some people don't play gams at top volume.-Some sound effects are super cheesy, like the eating sound, but it's just a personal thing.-Alot of useless buildings, like that train stations, there were too many decorative buildings, in a survival game you'd think that would be the perfect place to check. Nope. No Working doors.And now some things that I think would be nice to add...-It'd be nice to combine all the maps so there's no cut off from the adventure.-Maybe set it to where someone can host a game and handle more than 40 people-Female models would be nice, being a female I'd like to play as my gender.-More buildings would be nice as well.-Letting me take of clothes, I like runnin around like a mad man while requesting for hugs-It'd be nice to store weapons in your inventory as well, just let certain weapons take up more slots or something.-For people would capable of handling better graphics, it'd be nice to have an option to add more grass n'stuff, some places felt /too/ empty and simple addition of plants could fix that.

								Its interesting, Ill give it that. +The game appears to have client side loot-spawns, as in two people do not see the same loot unless they drop it personally from their inventory. This keeps loot fresh and relatively plentiful, which is a very interesting concept in a game such as this. +There appears to be one master server which houses individual hives in control of the separate territories, which in turn keeps latency and Dsync very low. Another interesting concept for sure.+Already plenty of variety in the loot and available weapons+Weapons feel and sound solid.-If you start the game without looking at the controls on the launcher first, you are going to have a bad time.-Game seems to be strictly PvP, which isnt necessarily a bad thing, just very frustrating sometimes. -Voice chat key is in an odd place, which if you didnt follow step 1, you will have a very bad time. (Its Z, but can be remapped)-/+ There is no player list, and there are no player names above players. This is amazing if you want to play by yourself or if you and your friends are seasoned veterans, but if you are new to this kind of game, finding friends will be frustrating. ""Is that you? No."" ""Is THIS you? No.""Overall for a game this new and still in early access, Ill give it an 8/10. Very entertaining, and it shows a lot of promise. Im kind of excited to see where the game goes.

								I have only played this game for 4 hours.I have only played Dayz standalone for 30 hours.Already this game is way more funner, you get a more survival feeling while playing, and guess what?No stupid♥♥♥♥♥buggy zombies that dayz has, you should pay £4 for this rather than £16 or more for Dayz shitalone.

								    I just want to say, I know this is early access. And it's great for the price. (And the fact that it runs on my god awful PC is even better.) But it does have a few bugs that makes it hard to play. First, I cant see my character. I can only see the clothes and other equipment. I haven't logged in much time. As you can see. Maybe 30 minutes at this point. And about 15 minutes was spent respawning after a spawn kill. Still better than ApocZ.Early Access- 7/10Full realease possibility- 9/10-10/10			"

								Love this game, many people hate on it because it isn't yet perfect, and because they don't understand it. This game is complex and requires some skill!! Most don't realise that you need to keep warm, and how to do it. Nor that there are about 8 zones. Get into it! $5 well spent!			"

								Love the game, I have been waiting for this to be on steam. Good game. So far so good, but the problem is I can't seem to get firewood. I know I have played the Facebook version of this but how the hell would you keep your self warm? Need more spawns of firewood and meds in med boxes just like in game. Theres also a tower somewhere in Factory map that when you climb to the top and see bunch of stuffs you want but when you try to get it, you can't cuz theres no way of getting there, I tried once but fell to my death and lost all of my stuff.Other than that its cool. Weapons and durabilities seems a bit unfair but its survival right? but where the hell would I find a repairing tool and an oil? I know I found an oil once but that was at Army map, but teh next game its just hard to find it.Oh this game is very very good as far as I know the only way to find a wood for fire is to chop trees down with an axe, very clever, this game is really talking how to really survive in a postapocalyptic era. Hopefully in the next patch is some game settings were in you can change your control settings cuz I have a hard time with the crouch in left Ctrl when I press twice I believe it goes prone, One more thing is the AI dogs, I HATE THEM! They know how to get inside a house and sometimes they just spawn or teleport behind you sometimes theres a bug where in they like suck into the groudn then appear in front of you. I don't know if other players are experiencing this too or is it just me. Anyway, I wish there would be a great update where in you can keep all you dress and bag THAT WOULD BE GREAT. Cuz finding those is absolutely crazy and time wasting cuz whenever someone kills you and on your next respawn you go half naked. Second of all, on the next update, I remembered the Facebook app of this tells you to buy a complete set of clothes, bags and a gun for a reasonable price and IT'S PERMANENT, hope that in this steam game there would be too.

								This genre is over-used. But this game is a great game to play with friends. It should be supported until it is fully created. At first, I thought this would be a zombie survival sandbox game, and that's why I tried it out. Turns out this was different, a virus infection without the zombies. Its very challenging, and this is a game that every survival fan should play. Although, there comes the annoying part, temperature. That is a very horrible add-on to the game, but due to solutions about the temperature, this game is just fine. A massive array of weapons, from the classic Axe, up to the American M4. A very big map to explore, from watery areas up to wildlife territories. The vehicles are just not right. You have to guess what should work with it. Also, there is no HUD, which is bad. No crafting recipes to be seen, unless for a few items that are pretty obvious. But for the overall, this game is a challenging game and a good one, too. So I probably recommend it to other players out there.			"

								Stay away from the schol if you don't have a weapon, unless  your life aspirations are to become wolf food, and expect to have a slow and painful death from dehydration because besides living in a snowy wonderland with lakes all around, it is near impossible to find a sustainable water supply. I need more Juice dammit! other than that the game is great fun for the price, I managed to find a shotgun and enough ammunation to deplete the Russian population. The game is simple to learn and a good fun if you can find someone who doesn't whisper sweet nothings into your ear as you loot an abandonded building together, I must also say this game is very tense when you are caught in a gun fight with someone, you don't alway know where they are and must track them via their footsteps or gunshots (You can actually see them it's just easy to lose sight of them) my best moment so far has been dispatching some poor bloke with one swift axe swipe and watching his corpse become a pretzel			"

Usually what im about to say is good but in this game stuff spawns too rarely which makes it impossible to progressi feel they should make it so you can find certain types of weapons just by looking around for a few minutes but others will be almost impossible to find4 . when you press play you just join a random server , no server selection5 . No Options menu , we really need an options menu to rebind keys figure out which keys to what? and this needs to be fixed now suggestion time!!!because this is an early access game here are a few suggestions for it1 . A Fun Mode where stuff spawns frequently (guns cars heli's ETC) and a hardcore mode where finding stuff is almost impossible2 . a new map! this map although big is just nothing special but i can live with it3 .

								           So far I've only played this game for 2 hrs, but it was definitly one of the most intresting expirences I've had. First I spawn shirtless like any normal russian would (right?) near some shack, so I seach around until a dog scares the sh*t out of me and I run for about five minutes until I meet my first fellow player. He was dressed in green and armed with a shotgun so I decide to stay back and watch due to me being KOS'ed countless times in other games like it, he leaves and I find an ugly blue sweater, my first loot item and it probably saved others from being stabbed by my undoubtly pointy nips. It's been about an hour and I also just found a 357 and 5 bullets for it too, a few minutes later a innocent looking shirtless man just charges at me with an axe and I nervously spray bullets all over the place and lucky he gets hit by one or two and it kills him. So, as I strut off like a bad*ss Clint Eastwood I hear barking it's about 5 wolves coming for me I some how manage to slay all of them with an axe and limp away, I hide in a factory building and just as I turn around another corner to see one more I get bit and die. I'm not angry in fact I'm almost in tears from laughter that I survived off of luck for so long survived a godamn axe attack! Just to be murdered by some wolf. Anyways my verdict is that this game has a good start and hopefully the devs will follow through. 10/10 would get wolf♥♥♥♥♥♥♥again			"

								Okay so they made it to where you start with no weapons. So now if you're a new spawn and a geared guy comes near you. you're effed. No fighting with fists, nothing like it. So new spawns beware that you HAVE to find a weapon to defend yourself. And good luck finding ammo that fits that first gun you find. (because the first weapon you find will MORE than likely be an unloaded gun.)			"

								I'll be quite honest, I love this game. Even if this is as good as it gets, I'll still play.It has its ups and downs.People will kill you for your shoes, heck I even killed a guy for a lighter once.It's just the way the game works, kill for shoes or be killed for shoes, your choice.Overall It's most definitely worth $5.

								This game is awesome to play. The only downside with the new update is that you can't ever play by yourself. If I could recommend any improvements the following would be my recommendations. 1. searching for a specific server would be nice for playing with friends 2. creating servers was nice, you could play by yourself and didn't have to worry about other players 3. spawning in with nothing makes it very hard to survive from dogs. All in all I know this game is a work in progress and nothing is final yet, but playing with friends can be very hard to do and playing by yourself is even harder. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I for sure do. Like I said I know its a work in progress and I'm happy to play the game.			"

								For 5 bucks, it's a good buy. I've played about an hour with some friends, and if I never play again, I believe I got my monies worth. It seemed really easy to find both of my friends when starting. Not sure if this was luck, or there's only a few new user spawn points, but we all started just a few blocks from each other.The game is difficult to get started in, as food doesn't seem very bountiful and you starve fairly quickly. It's basically a poormans DayZ. Should you get it? Yes, though remember: It's only 5 bucks, and you get what you pay for.			"

								This has to be the best £4 I have ever spent I have had loads of fun with this game.Graphics and animations are not the best but the game runs at a solid 60 FPS , the sound quality is brilliant and adds to the tense atmosphere of the game.This is not a PVE game and has not got PVE content this is a brutal PVP game where you will get KOS when you spawn , 90% of people will kill you.First day on the game I watched two fresh spawns brutally murdered by a scary russian and his friend armed to the teeth , I cowered behind a door clumped him on the back of his head , killed his mate and went on a rampage and then I was off.This game also has elevator music in lifts how good is that?So for a cheap £4 quick fun deathmatch because essentially base building and PVE content is not in then this is the game for you. If you cry when killed or want to hold hands with otehr survivors this is not for you.This is a tense gritty brutal murder simulator in Russia filled with Russians but its greatPlease view my you tube channel slightlymad79 there are 2 lengthy firstplay videos.

								In the beginning it was quite difficult, as there is no tutorial. I would recommend this guide to help you: http://steamcommunity.com/app/351290/guides/#scrollTop=0After some games, I got the hang of it. You need to loot a lot of houses, and try to build up a stack of food and drinks. An Axe is really important to get wood, and wood can be used for a lot of things. You need also a fair amount of luck with spawning, and the people in the server. If you spawn in the wrong place or meet people who kill you instantly, try another server.I would definitly recommend this game, as it is only 5 euro and it is quite some fun to play it! I will try and play it even more and probably will write another review after I know more of the game.			"

								Don't buy at this stage unless its under $10.00 , whilst fun it feels unfinished and unbalanced, however given this is early build its understandable.Pros :- Mostly complete game- Weapons are as expected in real life ( no head shot no damage RNG BS ) - Controls are fairly easy to use - Somewhat fun Cons : - You start the game unarmed, and you don't know how to punch or kick- Due to the above advanced players will camp your spawn points, as its safer to kill you than other well setup players- Nothing is explained before starting the game - Very easy to die of thirst, except its not logical, see empty bottles lying around, can you refill it ? , nope, drink a plastic bottle of water and the bottle vanishes- My system is fine , but it could chug on some machines- Not sure if everyone has this but my game had missing options from start menuMy review could change out of early testing , but at this stage stay away unless your wanting to put up with a fair amount of spawn killing and no real objective other than "" collect crap kill players ""			"

								I would have recommended this game an hour ago, but then I logged off and got shown a picture of a cat in a jar. Now every time I log off, I lose everything. All my items, all my progress. All of it doesn't stay. I just keep getting shown a cat in a jar every time I log off and I have to press Alt+F4 to quit.I don't know the reason for this, some are saying it's a ban, some say it's a bug. Whatever the reason, until this error gets fixed, this makes the game unplayable.EDIT: After trying again 48 hours later, my problem appears to be fixed. I'm still a little miffed it happened and want whatever happened to be resolved permanently, but it's working now and that's all that matters to me. Game is now recommended.			"

								I am going to base this review  on the price of the game vs. its current state.  I bought the game during a sale for less then $5. This is the price of a Venti Latte at my local starbucks so i didnt expect much.  My first few attempts at SPN were the short-lived Beta version.  I will keep this review secluded to the current Alpha version of the game.Pros: - open feel to game- lack of UI (adding to sense of realism)- No zombies (I have been an avid player of Dayz mod since a month of it's release, avid 7D2D player etc.. enough zeds!)- price point when on sale- general concept and gameplay of what people are looking for in a survival game- PvP was (in general) a lot of funCons:- lack of ability to turn head independent of body/movement- felt very limited in my abilities (crafting etc...)-  server list needs work- when you die you should spawn in the beg. area instead of current area. It should take longer then a minute or two to recover your body !! No fun to kill someone who can respawn and get back to there corpse before you can finish looting it....- graphics popping in and outOverviewThe game need A LOT of work, but the potential , framework is there. If you can pick it up for $5 it is well worth it.  The guys making the game are also giving it away for free in alpha, beta. Check the website! :D			"

								Found a house, went inside and encountered a fully kitted man.  Stared down the barrel of his shotgun.  He kept his sights on me for 20 seconds then let me go.  Found a shotgun, followed him outside and shot him.  No Russian.Honestly though, this game is pretty great.  I was able to find a shotgun, backpack, pistol and plenty of ammo, as well as some food within 20 minutes, whereas in Dayz or H1Z1, the chances of having all of those in 20 minutes are slim to none.  I don't like the cold mechanic all that much though, even wearing a heavy jacket and pants my cold increases steadily.			"

								For 5 bucks, it's a good buy. I've played about an hour with some friends, and if I never play again, I believe I got my monies worth. It seemed really easy to find both of my friends when starting. Not sure if this was luck, or there's only a few new user spawn points, but we all started just a few blocks from each other.The game is difficult to get started in, as food doesn't seem very bountiful and you starve fairly quickly. It's basically a poormans DayZ. Should you get it? Yes, though remember: It's only 5 bucks, and you get what you pay for.			"

								This game is truly wonderful. Note There are some issue's with the version for the U.S. as in when loading the initial game you DO NOT start with a Bat or Gun. This is ""Apparently supposed to be happening ""and it is not. Lets start by saying HOT DAMN, this is some cool shakkaka. Run-Find weapon-Beat up some wolfs - Slap a axe between someones face- Get some food- take his weapon if better than mine- See someones campfire in the distance- damn its raining- I'm freezing- Sneak up to dude's fire- Put one in the back of his head- profit of his gear- Get warm- eat some cereal - I hear footsteps - Fire has attracted more than myself- Look around - Six dude's behind me with assault rifles - ""whoa guy's .... lets talk about thi................Flatline...........         Lets do it again :D !!!!! I will say all and all this game is truly enjoyable. Iv'e played H1Z1 as well and if your a fan of the battle royal servers, then this is for you. Wolves could use some reducing in some areas but besides that......   good freaking job. Highly recommended !			"

Third through to fith time loading:Same as the 2nd timeSix'th:Praise the lord the main menu actually opened!!!! Can you believe it? I know right! I mean I thought I was crazy expecting a game to have a working main menu but it actually happene........ wait a minuteThe buttons dont work! Well I say the buttons dont work The, Play, Servers and help buttons didnt work. But Ironicly the quit button did! So Game devs done a great job at making a working quick button!

								Love the game, I have been waiting for this to be on steam. Good game. So far so good, but the problem is I can't seem to get firewood. I know I have played the Facebook version of this but how the hell would you keep your self warm? Need more spawns of firewood and meds in med boxes just like in game. Theres also a tower somewhere in Factory map that when you climb to the top and see bunch of stuffs you want but when you try to get it, you can't cuz theres no way of getting there, I tried once but fell to my death and lost all of my stuff.Other than that its cool. Weapons and durabilities seems a bit unfair but its survival right? but where the hell would I find a repairing tool and an oil? I know I found an oil once but that was at Army map, but teh next game its just hard to find it.Oh this game is very very good as far as I know the only way to find a wood for fire is to chop trees down with an axe, very clever, this game is really talking how to really survive in a postapocalyptic era. Hopefully in the next patch is some game settings were in you can change your control settings cuz I have a hard time with the crouch in left Ctrl when I press twice I believe it goes prone, One more thing is the AI dogs, I HATE THEM! They know how to get inside a house and sometimes they just spawn or teleport behind you sometimes theres a bug where in they like suck into the groudn then appear in front of you. I don't know if other players are experiencing this too or is it just me. Anyway, I wish there would be a great update where in you can keep all you dress and bag THAT WOULD BE GREAT. Cuz finding those is absolutely crazy and time wasting cuz whenever someone kills you and on your next respawn you go half naked. Second of all, on the next update, I remembered the Facebook app of this tells you to buy a complete set of clothes, bags and a gun for a reasonable price and IT'S PERMANENT, hope that in this steam game there would be too.

								Review:--For a game that is £3.99 its worth every penny. The half decent graphics that the game provides paired up with the amazing gameplay. There are some bugs and many unfinished items but hopefully they refine and add in future update. I'm a big fan of this and will be looking forward to see what they have in store for the community.Thing to add:--Add a sniper or a scope for the rifle.-A party option (for your friends to join your ''group'')-A bit more servers-And an option to create your own server			"

								This is how my first game went.1) Spawned.2) Looted nearby house and found bubble jacket.3) Searched for my friend in the server.4) Found friend.5) Died.Turns out that guy wasn't my friend, he happened to have exactly the same clothes my friend had described.But for a more serious review, this is really fun. Hearing others say that this game's better than DayZ in terms of stability and bugs. After a few hours playing by myself, I found out that you can get a grip on the controls pretty fast. Only a few complaints, but those are quite obvious. (Multiple weapons not being equipped.) In all, I give this a 9/10.			"

								It would be a great game if it wasnt for the hackers that plague every server. Or the groups of people fully decked out that run around and kill you instantly so if you are a single player you can never gear up. you find a rifle and stuff but no ammo or vise versa then you die before you can even fight back. It would be diffrent if they rob you and take what they want from your stuff but leave you the rest and send you on your way but no its just a huge kill feast. "

								The game looks great but what i don't like is that you start with nothing , means you can't even defend your self against stupid animals and other players with your fists . Further the graphics look good . What i also don't like is that you can't find any sort of weapon easy and that makes you die over and over again and lose everything you had so far . I have plaid for like a hour and i feel sad , not because of the money , but because i love games like this , but when others already enptied everything while there where only 2 other players on that server , than i really start to ask my self the question why is it so hard to find weapons / and the right bullets that is need for them . If you love running your♥♥♥♥♥of for dogs who keep chasing you and stalk you even when you are inside a building ,than this game is a must have , if you don't like it , well than you better look for another game .

								This game has good consistency behind it, however it is now abandoned by the developers, and will remain in it's state for a long time. I have attempted to give this game a chance to change, and the developers have had plenty of time to do it, but since this game is always going to remain in a broken state, I have been provoked to not recommend this game.  For example; the jumping physics in the game are absolute rubbish, forcing you to die, even if you jump from a little height.   However, do not take my word 100% for this game, you may really enjoy it, but I do recommend that you play with friends, it helps. Trust me.			"

								1. Find house.2. Lay low to not make noise in case anyone is around.3. Player comes out the door with an axe as he heard some of my footsteps.4. I quickly stand up point the gun at him, and say ""Back off!""5. I run inside the house looting everything I can.6. He tries to get close and I say ""Back off or I'll shoot!""7. I run out the house, go up to him, pull the trigger. No Bullets.8. Run away.I knew I had no bullets, yet it worked beautifully! in-game voice chat is excellent!Even though it's in Alpha, the optimization is really admirable. You've got a lot to do, and the pressure between players is pretty realistic with this setting. Survival: PostApocalypse Now can really become something great if the developers continue to put the time and dedication they have so far, and listen to the community!			"

								I think this game could be better than DayZ in the future!It has a lot of potential an is  in opposite to other games totally inexpensive.This game also is not based on killing each otheran that is the main positive aspect for me.The player have to defend against animals as well.In my opinion the whole looting system is fantastic.The player must decide which things he needs mostbecause his inventory is limited (could be upgraded by wearing a backpack).Also the fact weapons need different ammo is very realistic.All in all ""Survival: Postapocalypse Now"" is worth to buy!

The game is mostly like a mix between STALKER and DayZ, just without terrible movement, weapon handling, and all the bugs. The game could use some more content as in new locations, weapons, sounds, and enemies, but currently the game is definitely fine as it is.			"

								I wish there was a mixed button but there isn't soo...I started playin' survival back in 2015 with my best friend the game was available on facebook, you could buy kits that would vary from 0,20€  to 2€ wich is pretty much the same in dollars.The game was really fun, it was more focused on combat and pvp pretty much with no survival aspect, it had alot a hackers but they weren't a big threat. there were some bugs here and there but nothing special. And about the microtransactions, it was really easy to find weapons so the players that spent money in the game wouldn't have advantages. It's 2016, I have more than a 1000 hours in the game.Finnaly the steam version launched and we didn't really care.Soem onths later we decided to go to steam and see what's new about the steam version we looked at the community hub and there was a bunch of cool vehicles and etc, and we thought that the game was really cool so we decided to buy it.First day of playing the game, me and my friend took 1 hour and 30 minutes to find each other, then another hour goes by and we find one player who had a shotgun, we tried to communicate with him and he started shooting us, he missed all the shots and i shot him one time in the head i killed him, pretty use kill, i was already used to shooting in survival.So now i have 13hours of gameplay and i gotta say,the game has a LOT of potential but, right there's alot of bugs and gamebreaking problems, almost nobody playing and I  can understand why.So i recommend you to play the facebook version instead, you'll have alot more fun.If you have 5 bux to spare and want to support the devs it's your choice.I keep looking forward to this game, and i hope this review helps.

								This is a really awesome game, you'd expect it to be just like every other game (Ex, DayZ, Rust, H1Z1), but it's not! I think that this game has an different feel to it. With PvP and PvE, things never get boring! Crafting is easy, although finding the right items can sometimes be difficult and there are a lot of nice players!Why should you buy this game?- It's $5 and it will run on most rigs!- It's Early Access! If you want to be apart of something, small early access games like this are really fun! You can follow the development, let devs know about bugs, and maybe give them some tips!- It doesn't take long to find gear or other players and the map is still pretty big!Why wouldn't you want to buy this game?- It's Early Access . . .  There are going to be quite a few bugs, not everyone is going to be playing it, and it's basic.- Some people will be total♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and shoot you not long after you spawn, even if you don't have gear.- If you don't have patients, this game will suck for you. You may go through a life or two before you get enough gear and live for awhile because it is a little complicated to make a fire.If you want to read up on a short, awesome guide while the game downloads, click hereHELLFIRE BATTALION!!

								Survival:PAN as of right now in early access is MUCH more stable than all of the other hardcore survival games on release, and is also 4 times cheaper than the other games... However I do not know if the price is going to increase in the future.  Lets start with what I think the Pros arePros-Very Stable, servers have 0 lag or Dsync-EXTREMELY Optimized.... If you play on a lower end machine, Do not worry. Turn the graphics and resolution down and you're good to go-Very fun PvP; As of now the PvP is very Rustesq. Kills are very meaty and rewarding, and the bombat is generally fun to partake in-RP; As of 2/26/15 the game has little unreasonable kos...  Most players enjoy to RP atm and if there is combat, it is for a reason-Weapons;  Right now literally all of the weapons you find are: Shotguns, Hammers, and the 3 main pistols... In combat, body shots can rake up to 3 shots to kill, So when you are shot at, it is quite easy to return fire and not die instantly without a chance to fight back-Looks Great!; For this game to run so smooth and cost so little, the devs have put so much work into making it look decent-CRAFTING <3; A hardcore survival game in early access that has stable crafting and NO lag at the same time! HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Now, on to the cons- Very little explanation when you start the game,  There is no guidance in the beginning or anything telling you the craft system or how to do things... And as of now there is no wiki for the game :(-Crappy UI; The UI is honestly the biggest downfall of the game... The inventory system is clunky as ♥♥♥♥, and to a new player... You don't know what going on, Your equipped items don't show up in your inventory, there is no ammo indication(so you never no how much ammo you ave unless your'e using the double barrel or one of the revolvers). Aswell as when your'e critically wounded you do not know if you are going to have the bleed effect or not until your screen starts blinking-Loot; Lot spawning is not really that great, In the trailers it shows awesome assault rifle battles, but in the real game, you're lucky to find ammo for you pistol... I've never even seen a player with an AR, the best I have seen is the Mosin.  A lot of the times you will also die of dehydration because you find ♥♥♥♥ tons of food and no ♥♥♥♥ing water... And gas cans are the rarest ♥♥♥♥ing thing in the game I swear, like i just wanna drive my ♥♥♥♥ing tractor with my bros god damnit-♥♥♥♥ING WOLVES, THE GOD DAMN WOLVES ARE SO ♥♥♥♥ING ANNOYING, THIS IS NOT THE LONG DARK, GTFO WOLVES.All in All this game is one of the most solid Early Access games i have ever played aside from KSP. So sell your AK redline and buy this game before it rises in price because the game is a diamond in the like a baby in the trash "

I have found some bugs, but compared to dayz this is better (seems impossible but yes, the true) you can drive and fly helicopters, you can have many weapons, no lag, low end pc's can run it.If the devs continue supporting the game, this will be the best 5 euros that i have spent on steam.. And i am not kidding!			"

								It's a lot of fun, it is similar to Dayz, looting and random death matches. I own games i have spent 50$ on, that i have enjoyed much less. If getting killed on sight in Dayz/rust/h1z1 is the worst thing about those games, this is not for you. however If you embrace the RDM and enjoy exploring a interesting map, well attempting to stay alive. It's well worth the buy. only 5$			"

								To tell you the truth, this game actually has major potential. I mean, it runs smoothly most of the time, and only having a dot on your screen for  aiming makes game-play kinda freaky, especially all you can hear when hiding is other peoples footsteps coming towards you. It needs a chat box at least, and ways to change your weapon easily. Other than that the game is K and it didn't give me cancer like I thought it would based on the game's name and description (Which is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥poor to read which needs fixing).			"

								This Game is not the most beautiful out there but oh my Glow Cloud (all hail) is it fun!I have been on a number of adventures in the short time that i played...most ending in a combination of freezing to death and/or dog attacks.The community is fantastic, I met this one guy who called himself baldy. we had no weapons so we where on a search we walked a fairly large distance talking and gathering food in the hope of some warm clothes and guns.  All was well until we reached an abandoned school and where chased by a dog and got separated and didn't see him again. about 10 mins later i found some weapons but realised i was freezing to death. Suddenly the game turned into a race against the clock to start a campfire before i died. I cut a tree down and got some wood that i couldn't light. Apparently i needed gasoline... i spent the next 10-15 mins struggling to find gas opening every locker in hoppes of finding some. it got to the point where i was almost dead. i heard a barking behind me and a dog ran through the door and killed me with one bite.My story isn't even the best yet to come. I know by what i've experienced thus far that i have so much more to explore.only downside is the inventory is tough to get used to. im never sure how certain things are supposed to work together, but all in all this game has HOURS of intense survival that still awaits me and hopefully any other pontential buyer.

								first off im going into depth with this reveiew. so you all know this game looks fun and it is to a certan point i recommend this game cause it is fun to a certan point and you still have to consider that this game is in early access and it shows a lot of promise ill get into my thoughts now as a 70 something hour player of this game ive done about everything you can do in this game ive had alot of bugs and a lot of fun but ill get into the bugs the ones i hate most are 1. when you get to the army base from going threw the marsh you cant go back threw the marsh to get back to the part of the map before it it just goes black screen and you cant do anything another one is some times you will find something good like a good weapon if you drop a weaker weapon then try to pick that one up sometimes it will cause you to pick up the old weapon and the good weapon will be gone the pros of this game are its fun its also challanging which is a good concept in games like this you dont want it to be to easy or it wont be any fun also i like the building system but if you could put locked doors and maybe have severs that save so if you build a massive fort like me and my freind built around the school it dosent just disapear and maybe different matirials that you can use to build with and maybe latters that you can climb towers instead of having such a problem with trying to get the ramps to line up also if you could add frequenceys to the radio so that freinds cant be heard while planning an attack and maybe if you add different material building then you could have different ways to destroy each kind of building and if you could make it eaiser to make the bomb like scatter the parts in different part of the maps and maybe add a trading station farther in the distant future where there is a safe zone where you can trade and maybe add a curency system but i could go on forever i think this will do but if you need to contact me even if your a player that needs to know how this game is let me know on this profile ill talk to you guys later peace.

								I love it. I played 18 hours within 3 days because I love it so much. Yes, obviously there are some errors, but what some people don't understand is... It's in alpha! Yes, there are going to be glitches!Some people are also saying that you get thirsty to fast, it makes it challenging, im always on the edge of my seat when I play this. I do reccomend that you can use your fists to fight, so when you begin its a bit easier, I died 9 times when I started because of lack  of weapon, and also in your inventory ""thirsty"" is spelled ""thristy"".Similar to H1Z1 and DayZ, but instead of zombies, its a fight for hunger, and wolves, and bears!Also VERY good graphics and it runs smoothly, even with all visual settings all the way up!Looking for a cheap, but good game?

								So first off as of today I have 15 hours playing this game.This game is keeping with the tradition of the genre by being early access alpha. It is 5 us dollars on steam (cheapest of the two well known DayZSA and H1Z1). It has a few glitches like seeing people in the prone animation when they are sprinting and dogs running through walls. These are the only major glitches I've found in the game. This game runs on full graphics settings at 60fps no problem for a mid-range PC. It has quite a few different guns where you have to load the correct ammo into the correct mag. The graphics are okay, and the first person animations are alright. The map is a linear map starting in the school and goes toward the factory. The map is split into zones that you can see if you find a map in game. Simply run to the edge and you will load into the next zone. This game has underground bunkers and several different cars to repair as well as a helicopter. There is a food/drink system to stay alive. There is a health system and a constant fear of freezing to death which seems to only be combated by a fire. Overall the amount of loot you'll find versus what you need to stay alive is well balance. You'll always need something to stay alive. You'll find yourself fighting the cold, other players, and dogs to stay alive while you explore the different zones and get geared up.This game has a lot of potential if it gets support and the dev's keep working hard. In its current state its worth the 5 dollars and its probably only going to get better. "

								Survival: Postapocalypse Now is an early acces Alpha FPS survival game, it has no campaign but a funny, adventurous and sometimes exciting multiplayer-survaval game mode. Although it costs us a little, as far as I'm concerned, it is not too much for the content of the game. In addition to in-game features, sometimes players will have to face challenges from the environment itself and other players, prudence will be your key and best friend to survive with.In this game, you will find more developped materials, resources and weapons by moving further and further away, you can still stay where you were when you have spawned, but my suggestion will be to advance, get fully equipped and packed with enough food and other raw materials. In this game, you can even make a helicopter fly or driving cars and jeeps.I also strongly recommend you to play this game with friends, it will be really funny and interesting to play with more players than just alone. It will be much easier to survive since you find different materials in different places, for example: you might find an AK-47 on a table while your teamnate can see just a bottle of water on the same table. You will get more chance to find rare items and will find it easier to survive. You can also kill the players then grab their items, which is more easily than gather them slowly but surely.P.S: there are no zombies in this game, so if you get into a dark area you don't need to be afraid.^^Positive remarks+ multiplayer mode+ very interesting and funny to play with friends+ difficulty improved each time you go towards a new map+ challenging to survive with some enemy players+ wide range of weapons and resources+ only 2 kinds of animals will attack you: wolves(dogs?) and bears+ new ways to survive ( cooking )+ vehicles + dynamite+ quick updates from the GM+ different features and functions on clothesNegative remarks- sometimes severe bugs will occur (ex: you spawn on the sky and die by falling on the ground)- animals (that are offensive) spawn always at the same place, less challenging- only a few maps to discover- hackers- temperature issues for survival decreases a little bit too quickly- at first, players spawn in a prison and can die right away if you don't get out quickly enough, especially to beginners- weapon switching system is a bit strange			"

								With no more time than I have in it so far, I would have to say it is a pretty good game. Many people are complaining that it is not well thought out, and so on, but it is clearly an alpha. They are actively working on it, with two updates being posted within the last two days. I was looking for a true survival game that encouraged caution and resourcefulness, so if you are looking for a game that is about taking your time, instead of running headfirst into everything and expecting everything you need to be handed to you, this might be it. The players are the biggest danger, so unless you are prepared to die and lose everything you have, don't go looking for other players until you are armed.   If you play it, you will inevitably run from wolves because you have no weapons to defend yourselves (picking up a 2x4 does make sense, if you could...) and crouching in corners, waiting for groups to go by without noticing you.             I would like to see foraging for food, and many other things that others have mentioned as well. For instance, there are people out there that do not need to douse their wood in gasoline to start a  fire, so maybe some sort of survival skill system would pan out well with the game, without breaking the gameplay. I don't necessarily dislike any aspect of the game (aside from wolves that walk through closed doors), but am eager to see the forthcoming improvements.			"

								Not really a good game, the surviving aspect of the game is ok. But its not really about survival at all its lets who could get ammo and a gun first. All you really worry about is other players that are going to try to kill you. The only other threats is a bear and wolfs. Plus people who playing for awhile on a server build blockade to different places so you can't get anything and you can't trust anyone. The only to communicate with other people is if you own or if you want to use a mic. No way to differentiate from friends or foes and what I mean by that is there no name tag or anything			"

								I would not recommend this game until create a server is an option again. there are many people who hunt weaponless players simply for sport, many of them camping a general area which seems to be a regular spawn point for new players and respawning players, this occurs on multiple servers.My first half hour playing:Joined server, immediately got killed by two people with shotguns.Respawned in almost exact location, killed by same people.Respawned in almost exact location, killed by same people.Respawned in almost exact location, killed by same damn people.Joined new server, immediately killed by group of players camping with shotguns.Joined new server, managed to scavenge two buildings before being killed by players with shotguns.Respawned, not even 5 mins later killed by same players.Joined new server, managed to scavenge 5 buildings with a few new(or respawned) players before the lot of us were mowed down by an angry mob with revolvers and shotguns. Respawned stupidly close to same area, 2mins later killed by same angry mob.I get it, it's PvP... but shooting freshly spawned players is about as tough as punching a baby.			"

								This is how my first game went.1) Spawned.2) Looted nearby house and found bubble jacket.3) Searched for my friend in the server.4) Found friend.5) Died.Turns out that guy wasn't my friend, he happened to have exactly the same clothes my friend had described.But for a more serious review, this is really fun. Hearing others say that this game's better than DayZ in terms of stability and bugs. After a few hours playing by myself, I found out that you can get a grip on the controls pretty fast. Only a few complaints, but those are quite obvious. (Multiple weapons not being equipped.) In all, I give this a 9/10.			"

								It would be a great game if it wasnt for the hackers that plague every server. Or the groups of people fully decked out that run around and kill you instantly so if you are a single player you can never gear up. you find a rifle and stuff but no ammo or vise versa then you die before you can even fight back. It would be diffrent if they rob you and take what they want from your stuff but leave you the rest and send you on your way but no its just a huge kill feast. "

								Review:--For a game that is £3.99 its worth every penny. The half decent graphics that the game provides paired up with the amazing gameplay. There are some bugs and many unfinished items but hopefully they refine and add in future update. I'm a big fan of this and will be looking forward to see what they have in store for the community.Thing to add:--Add a sniper or a scope for the rifle.-A party option (for your friends to join your ''group'')-A bit more servers-And an option to create your own server			"

								One of the best survival games out there! If you're trying to decide whether to buy this game, let me tell you, it's definitely worth the $5. I also bought 2 copies for my friends and it's our new favorite game to play together. When we first logged on, I thought this game was going to be a waste of money, but then we began to understand the game better and we figured out that there's a lot more to this game than you think. We play it all the time now and we're still new players in it, but it's a good game.We were always stuck in the first area where we always spawned and couldn't figure out what to do next, but now I've memorized the areas and maps and we're moving up. There's a lot of stuff in this game, but I know you're wondering where the zombies are at...well, there are no zombies! But that's a good thing with this game. It makes it a better and more realistic game without zombies, and gives you more time to focus on not getting killed by other players or wolves!I really recommend this game and if you have the money, please buy it and support these great developers.

								Well, where to start with this game. If this had been full price, this game would not have been purchased. It feels good at first,  you start off in a jail cell, atmosphere is very dark	, along with the lighting in the game. it gives off a horror game feel, but is a survivial game. i guess getting ***** by bears is pretty scary since finding the weapons to fight it are hard to do, then killing the thing if you're lucky only getting one in the area, have fun with that. the bears are waaaaaaay too overpowered in my honest opinion. once you play the game for a bit you get the hang of it, oh wait, youre thirsty? pfft, have a gander at locating some water and dealing with the annoying ""im thirsty"" qoutes. We get it! there are no women in the game! jokes aside it really is annoying to hear the thirst speeches every minute.   i would up vote the game but there really is no real reason to.  the thing i liked about the game was the jail cell.  but that got taken away from me when you leave it. if you really dont care about your money, get it for you and a friend and play it for two hours and then ask each other if valve can refund time. P.S.: they cant, i already asked.			"

								i had bought this game since it first appeared at steam shore as a alpha test version.And I was attrated by the pictures.But i found myself wrong when i got in..The graphic was a little bit dispointing to me and the gaming was very killing me.First, no third person view means you have to overcome the dizzy feel that was brought by the camera shakes.   And the worst part of the game is the gun problem..As I knew there were so many guns in the game.And fortunately I accidentaly found one.Magnum pistol(whatever it calls) i dont really remember.I could not  actually equip it during my first game time.And it absolutely took away my passion to the game..But few weeks later.Beta came up.I updated.And start with hopes.But when i tried to connect to the server, it just kept me waiting on the waiting line........So,what.....

								I wouldnt even waste a penny on this game. Horrible, absolutely horrible. First off there is no tutorial so you basically are put into the game and you have no clue what to do. Second there is no loot anywhere except for the occasional can of beans. The graphics are worse than the original gameboy graphics. And last but not least you cant walk 10 yards without someone trying to kill you and you cant even talk to anyone. I just have one question for the game makers, What are you even supossed to do in this game? I highly recommend that you dont waste your money on this.			"

								Whoevers designing this really needs to fix the black screen glitch.I literally despawned yesterday in the school area, i spawned in this morning and my character had aparently been moved or something because i was most certainly not where i left off, so i decided to walk in the direction i thought the school was in only to go to a black screen and be stuck there permanently even after hitting the suicide button and deleting and redownloading the game, im really upset because this game has great potential and has provided tons of fun hours  but if this is really the end of my journey then i definitely dont recommend this game to anyone.Or a posibility if the games creator could please kill me or move me or something id really appreciate being able to play again.

Why? They made playable ""beta"" version which I played for about 20 hours. But then they probably thought ""Hey, lets make new version of this game with better graphics and other improvements"". And you know what? They f****d up. New ""alpha"" is terrible, full of bugs, containing 3-4 maps full of emptiness, bugged wolves/dogs, and objects with boring, grey-brown textures. They added achievements! In russian of course... Now here's the crazy thing right now.They added new game on Steam Greenlight. Which looks like this game. Why...? Dear developers - finish this game before making new one.You made playable, pretty nice game in ""beta"" (old survival), so why can't you continue making it?

								2016 full review edit / change to not recommended...: I can't recommend this game anymore. It's very glitchy, no one plays anymore (30 people across multiple servers, if that.) and the devs have abandoned the game to work on their next project. Postapocalypse Now: War. Here's just a few glitches / annoyances.Animals (bears, wolves) spotting you from half way across the map.Animals never ceasing to stop chasing you. If you somehow break their pathing (climb on a ladder, close a door) they will sit there and wait for you forever.Weapons are always unloaded. No ammo, no clips or magazines, nothing. Finding guns is arguable the most common. Finding literally anything useful is a test of patience.You're constantly freezing to death. To stay warm you need an axe to cut down a tree and get wood, fuel to soak the wood and a lighter to burn it. That wouldn't be so bad if you weren't CONSTANTLY. FREEZING. TO DEATH.You start out at about 37 or so degrees celcius. Celcius. That's 98.6 degrees fahrenheit.You will freeze to death and die at about 25 celcius. THAT'S  77 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT. YOU DIE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE. IN THE MIDDLE OF SIBERIA. NAKED.This upsets me the most, because food and water are managable, but god help you if you don't find the tools for a fire. R.I.P. Dmitry. Got slightly too cool and died.You're completely defenseless most of the time. You find a gun? Good for you, it will never have ammo and good luck finding any. Pray you find a melee weapon.Their newest ""alpha"" version of the game is literally an unplayable mess, it was somehow more broken than their older version. Like, broken to the point where your mouse didn't work when you tried to play it.It had a lot of squandered potential, and it was actually a lot of fun when hundreds of people played, devs were still working on the game and you had someone to play with despite it being glitchy. The last ""update"" was in March, with the ungodly terrible alpha update.Don't buy this game, it doesn't seem to be getting any better from here.			"

								This game needs a lot of improvement. But, It does have some Pros.Pros:Pretty good way of actually starting your survival. (Trying to escape the prison you woke up in)Pretty cheap survival game.Somewhat realistic.Weather can actually kill you.No hackers. (YET)Now... lets go to the cons.Cons:Grahpics are a little bad.You can't even change grahpic settings nor any settings.No way of typing so people without mics can really communicate.Teleports. (You can walk to a certain area and get teleported to another part of a map, I think thats a little annoying, making the map bigger to make that all fit would be good and much better)Crafting is a little annoying to use.Wolves and bears spawn the exact same place everytime.You spawn with your stuff from another server.No way to make your own server.Crouching makes you go through this procces; Crouch then Prone then stand back up. You can just go back to standing.You can fall from 2 feet and get injured.The community is already going bad. (People are just killing on sight and people are just roasting each other)Base building is really that good. (People are just building in already generated buildings and they claim it as their own)The only people I ever saw playing this game were Russians. You already know what Russians do in CS:GO.... Don't need to explain.If you want to play a cheap survival game when you are bored this is the game. I don't recommend putting hours and hours of gameplay on this because this game isn't finished and you'll probably die by falling or a Russian on the server killing you.			"

								Survival: Postapocalypse Now is an early acces Alpha FPS survival game, it has no campaign but a funny, adventurous and sometimes exciting multiplayer-survaval game mode. Although it costs us a little, as far as I'm concerned, it is not too much for the content of the game. In addition to in-game features, sometimes players will have to face challenges from the environment itself and other players, prudence will be your key and best friend to survive with.In this game, you will find more developped materials, resources and weapons by moving further and further away, you can still stay where you were when you have spawned, but my suggestion will be to advance, get fully equipped and packed with enough food and other raw materials. In this game, you can even make a helicopter fly or driving cars and jeeps.I also strongly recommend you to play this game with friends, it will be really funny and interesting to play with more players than just alone. It will be much easier to survive since you find different materials in different places, for example: you might find an AK-47 on a table while your teamnate can see just a bottle of water on the same table. You will get more chance to find rare items and will find it easier to survive. You can also kill the players then grab their items, which is more easily than gather them slowly but surely.P.S: there are no zombies in this game, so if you get into a dark area you don't need to be afraid.^^Positive remarks+ multiplayer mode+ very interesting and funny to play with friends+ difficulty improved each time you go towards a new map+ challenging to survive with some enemy players+ wide range of weapons and resources+ only 2 kinds of animals will attack you: wolves(dogs?) and bears+ new ways to survive ( cooking )+ vehicles + dynamite+ quick updates from the GM+ different features and functions on clothesNegative remarks- sometimes severe bugs will occur (ex: you spawn on the sky and die by falling on the ground)- animals (that are offensive) spawn always at the same place, less challenging- only a few maps to discover- hackers- temperature issues for survival decreases a little bit too quickly- at first, players spawn in a prison and can die right away if you don't get out quickly enough, especially to beginners- weapon switching system is a bit strange			"

The reason im rating down is because you know how in dayZ you always felt you were a survivor looting the abandon lands and you felt it when you lost your stuff? in Survival it never really feels like, ykno....survival, just a deathmatch where you look for your weapons in a map that looks identical no matter where you go.

								i had bought this game since it first appeared at steam shore as a alpha test version.And I was attrated by the pictures.But i found myself wrong when i got in..The graphic was a little bit dispointing to me and the gaming was very killing me.First, no third person view means you have to overcome the dizzy feel that was brought by the camera shakes.   And the worst part of the game is the gun problem..As I knew there were so many guns in the game.And fortunately I accidentaly found one.Magnum pistol(whatever it calls) i dont really remember.I could not  actually equip it during my first game time.And it absolutely took away my passion to the game..But few weeks later.Beta came up.I updated.And start with hopes.But when i tried to connect to the server, it just kept me waiting on the waiting line........So,what.....

								This game is awesome to play. The only downside with the new update is that you can't ever play by yourself. If I could recommend any improvements the following would be my recommendations. 1. searching for a specific server would be nice for playing with friends 2. creating servers was nice, you could play by yourself and didn't have to worry about other players 3. spawning in with nothing makes it very hard to survive from dogs. All in all I know this game is a work in progress and nothing is final yet, but playing with friends can be very hard to do and playing by yourself is even harder. Do I recommend this game? Yes, I for sure do. Like I said I know its a work in progress and I'm happy to play the game.			"

								For 5 bucks, it's a good buy. I've played about an hour with some friends, and if I never play again, I believe I got my monies worth. It seemed really easy to find both of my friends when starting. Not sure if this was luck, or there's only a few new user spawn points, but we all started just a few blocks from each other.The game is difficult to get started in, as food doesn't seem very bountiful and you starve fairly quickly. It's basically a poormans DayZ. Should you get it? Yes, though remember: It's only 5 bucks, and you get what you pay for.			"

								Don't buy at this stage unless its under $10.00 , whilst fun it feels unfinished and unbalanced, however given this is early build its understandable.Pros :- Mostly complete game- Weapons are as expected in real life ( no head shot no damage RNG BS ) - Controls are fairly easy to use - Somewhat fun Cons : - You start the game unarmed, and you don't know how to punch or kick- Due to the above advanced players will camp your spawn points, as its safer to kill you than other well setup players- Nothing is explained before starting the game - Very easy to die of thirst, except its not logical, see empty bottles lying around, can you refill it ? , nope, drink a plastic bottle of water and the bottle vanishes- My system is fine , but it could chug on some machines- Not sure if everyone has this but my game had missing options from start menuMy review could change out of early testing , but at this stage stay away unless your wanting to put up with a fair amount of spawn killing and no real objective other than "" collect crap kill players ""			"

								I would have recommended this game an hour ago, but then I logged off and got shown a picture of a cat in a jar. Now every time I log off, I lose everything. All my items, all my progress. All of it doesn't stay. I just keep getting shown a cat in a jar every time I log off and I have to press Alt+F4 to quit.I don't know the reason for this, some are saying it's a ban, some say it's a bug. Whatever the reason, until this error gets fixed, this makes the game unplayable.EDIT: After trying again 48 hours later, my problem appears to be fixed. I'm still a little miffed it happened and want whatever happened to be resolved permanently, but it's working now and that's all that matters to me. Game is now recommended.			"

								One of the best survival games out there! If you're trying to decide whether to buy this game, let me tell you, it's definitely worth the $5. I also bought 2 copies for my friends and it's our new favorite game to play together. When we first logged on, I thought this game was going to be a waste of money, but then we began to understand the game better and we figured out that there's a lot more to this game than you think. We play it all the time now and we're still new players in it, but it's a good game.We were always stuck in the first area where we always spawned and couldn't figure out what to do next, but now I've memorized the areas and maps and we're moving up. There's a lot of stuff in this game, but I know you're wondering where the zombies are at...well, there are no zombies! But that's a good thing with this game. It makes it a better and more realistic game without zombies, and gives you more time to focus on not getting killed by other players or wolves!I really recommend this game and if you have the money, please buy it and support these great developers.

								So I have been trying all day to play this game and there is absolutely 0 people online.  When you try to start a game you get a black screen but you can still hear your character jumping and moving if you use the controls.  Even when there is people online this game is pretty much unplayable.  Full of Bugs,glitches and hackers.  DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.  I am starting to get the feeling it was a scam the whole time.  Has a cool concept I wish a developer who isnt an incompetent fool would take this game up and make it right.  Steam you need to take this game off the market it is a straight up scam.  I cant believe it has lasted this long.			"

								This game sucks. It has no tutorial and just drops you into the game and expects you to try. I tried. All they give you to defend yourself at the start is a torch. A torch that as far as I can tell you cant relight after it extinguishes. But if you die, as you likely will, you have nothing. You cannot attack without a weapon, and you cannot craft anything. There are a few cars and such parked around, but none of them work. And when you die, you have no choice but to watch some other moron, likely the one that killed you, walk around for 60 seconds straight. Don't want to sit through that 60 seconds? Sucks for you. The only way to exit the game from the inside is through the invintory, which you cannot open when dead. DO NOT GIVE THESE PARISITES ONE MORE PENNEY!!!			"

								First of all: the ""our game is almost in a finished state"" in the discription is a LIE ... i would call it a superearly-ALPHABecause there are more CON´s than PRO´s i will start with the CON´s this time---CONS---> NOTHING is explained in this game ... absolutely nothing - this makes the first time of the game a pain in the A$$lovely if your character is freezing, you have a lighter, you have gasoline, you have wood, and you just cant find out how to make a fire to keep yourself warm. > ""open world"" here means a lot of smaller areas connected viá quick-travel points > weapon-system is annoying . you can carry (2?) weapons but put nothing (revolver or hammer for example) in your backpack. sometimes your weapon stays on the floor if you change it to another, sometimes it just disappears (so no switching back if you change your mind for some reason, yaay -.-)> voice-chat radius is a joke, you really have to stand next to the person you wanna talk to (not that useful if you wnt to find out if he is friendly)>  the community... again (like in the most survival games...) people kill just at sight, doesnt matter if you just spawned in your underwear and obviously not dangerous> the inventory-size makes no sense: you have 8 slots if you are running around in underwear ... you will be crying when you finally find a standard-backpack and see it just gives you 4(!?) new slots> items arent shared in teh world... what i mean: i see (for example) a can of beans in a shelf - my friend (standing next to me) cant see it but maybe has something totally differnt in the same location (or nothing). only option is to pick it up and drop it for him. well seems like a simple way to solve the problem, BUT: this means if you play in a team everyone has to search each house individual - gamebreaking in my opinion>  spectator mode when you die ... seriously?---PROS---> cheap> graphic is ""ok""> you can open nearly every drawer and door to search for stuff > havent had any server issues so far> HAS the potential to become a good game someday			"

								The game have great potential, but comes out to short in everything.The map is devided into zones, with a stupid loading in between them. If you find  yourself lost, and commit sucide or die, you spawn in the same area everytime.There are also only a few ways out of a zone, if you just walk straight in a direction the screen turn black and you need to restart the game, and then you will find yourself in excatly the same spot.

The only complaint i have is theres no offline mode, the game could have a section of the game for online and offline, so people dont cheat and get items for pvp, but so people can play while traveling or just so sometimes you can explore without being attacked. Anyways if your havent bought it, stop reading this and buy it!			"

								Well after begging quite awhile for an 'Invert Mouse' option, here's my promised negative review. I see the latest update has all kinds of nifty goodies like helecopters, lockpicking and developer nosepicking.  I and many others have waited patiently, but the devs for this game are more interested in making kewl beards and gun models. They have no interest in making a serious control issue top priority.  AS AN INVERTED-MOUSE-CHALLENGED GAMER I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO BE ABUSED BY RUSSIAN PLAYERS TOO!!  Otherwise, neat game.  C'mon devs, get this taken care of.  This is ridiculous.			"

								Personally not a game for me, it is literally just you running around a forest which is empty, you may find a couple of buildings or a train station but nothing interesting to be found here, no items or any form of interaction with anything. This game, is literaly just running around doing nothing, on top of this I only saw one guy, and guess what he was doing? Running around doing nothing. There is no tactics to this game world. You may be lucky to find something, but whatever you find is purely luck, nothing more. These reviews must be fake or something because its the worst game I've played.			"

								I wish there was a mixed button but there isn't soo...I started playin' survival back in 2015 with my best friend the game was available on facebook, you could buy kits that would vary from 0,20€  to 2€ wich is pretty much the same in dollars.The game was really fun, it was more focused on combat and pvp pretty much with no survival aspect, it had alot a hackers but they weren't a big threat. there were some bugs here and there but nothing special. And about the microtransactions, it was really easy to find weapons so the players that spent money in the game wouldn't have advantages. It's 2016, I have more than a 1000 hours in the game.Finnaly the steam version launched and we didn't really care.Soem onths later we decided to go to steam and see what's new about the steam version we looked at the community hub and there was a bunch of cool vehicles and etc, and we thought that the game was really cool so we decided to buy it.First day of playing the game, me and my friend took 1 hour and 30 minutes to find each other, then another hour goes by and we find one player who had a shotgun, we tried to communicate with him and he started shooting us, he missed all the shots and i shot him one time in the head i killed him, pretty use kill, i was already used to shooting in survival.So now i have 13hours of gameplay and i gotta say,the game has a LOT of potential but, right there's alot of bugs and gamebreaking problems, almost nobody playing and I  can understand why.So i recommend you to play the facebook version instead, you'll have alot more fun.If you have 5 bux to spare and want to support the devs it's your choice.I keep looking forward to this game, and i hope this review helps.

								This game sucks. It has no tutorial and just drops you into the game and expects you to try. I tried. All they give you to defend yourself at the start is a torch. A torch that as far as I can tell you cant relight after it extinguishes. But if you die, as you likely will, you have nothing. You cannot attack without a weapon, and you cannot craft anything. There are a few cars and such parked around, but none of them work. And when you die, you have no choice but to watch some other moron, likely the one that killed you, walk around for 60 seconds straight. Don't want to sit through that 60 seconds? Sucks for you. The only way to exit the game from the inside is through the invintory, which you cannot open when dead. DO NOT GIVE THESE PARISITES ONE MORE PENNEY!!!			"

								Survival: Postapocalypse Now is an early acces Alpha FPS survival game, it has no campaign but a funny, adventurous and sometimes exciting multiplayer-survaval game mode. Although it costs us a little, as far as I'm concerned, it is not too much for the content of the game. In addition to in-game features, sometimes players will have to face challenges from the environment itself and other players, prudence will be your key and best friend to survive with.In this game, you will find more developped materials, resources and weapons by moving further and further away, you can still stay where you were when you have spawned, but my suggestion will be to advance, get fully equipped and packed with enough food and other raw materials. In this game, you can even make a helicopter fly or driving cars and jeeps.I also strongly recommend you to play this game with friends, it will be really funny and interesting to play with more players than just alone. It will be much easier to survive since you find different materials in different places, for example: you might find an AK-47 on a table while your teamnate can see just a bottle of water on the same table. You will get more chance to find rare items and will find it easier to survive. You can also kill the players then grab their items, which is more easily than gather them slowly but surely.P.S: there are no zombies in this game, so if you get into a dark area you don't need to be afraid.^^Positive remarks+ multiplayer mode+ very interesting and funny to play with friends+ difficulty improved each time you go towards a new map+ challenging to survive with some enemy players+ wide range of weapons and resources+ only 2 kinds of animals will attack you: wolves(dogs?) and bears+ new ways to survive ( cooking )+ vehicles + dynamite+ quick updates from the GM+ different features and functions on clothesNegative remarks- sometimes severe bugs will occur (ex: you spawn on the sky and die by falling on the ground)- animals (that are offensive) spawn always at the same place, less challenging- only a few maps to discover- hackers- temperature issues for survival decreases a little bit too quickly- at first, players spawn in a prison and can die right away if you don't get out quickly enough, especially to beginners- weapon switching system is a bit strange			"

								-It would be good if there were more players.-Stupid Turtorial - you will waste like 10 minutes unlocking the door , 20 minutes finding the door u need and 5 minutes unlocking the door!-More like Walking Simulator-It is  difficult surviving (the only think i like about the game)-Bad inventory-The fighting is good, but u won't see peope ( i know because i watched youtubers playing it before it died)-I give this game 4/10 because i love survival games-I wasn't hating, i just gave me personal opinion!

								This game has good consistency behind it, however it is now abandoned by the developers, and will remain in it's state for a long time. I have attempted to give this game a chance to change, and the developers have had plenty of time to do it, but since this game is always going to remain in a broken state, I have been provoked to not recommend this game.  For example; the jumping physics in the game are absolute rubbish, forcing you to die, even if you jump from a little height.   However, do not take my word 100% for this game, you may really enjoy it, but I do recommend that you play with friends, it helps. Trust me.			"

								The game looks great but what i don't like is that you start with nothing , means you can't even defend your self against stupid animals and other players with your fists . Further the graphics look good . What i also don't like is that you can't find any sort of weapon easy and that makes you die over and over again and lose everything you had so far . I have plaid for like a hour and i feel sad , not because of the money , but because i love games like this , but when others already enptied everything while there where only 2 other players on that server , than i really start to ask my self the question why is it so hard to find weapons / and the right bullets that is need for them . If you love running your♥♥♥♥♥of for dogs who keep chasing you and stalk you even when you are inside a building ,than this game is a must have , if you don't like it , well than you better look for another game .

								what can i say.after the last update! the game is unplayable!!! the lat of the mouse is to freeking high! even if you lower it as much you can. even did try to lower it on my computer AND the game.. stil the same shiit.its sad that the devs dont fix this asap. cuz this can become a rly good game.overall the game is a surviving game and you need to eat, drink and hunt to stay alive.watch out for other players and more.tho they sould change the cold system so that when you get gears you dont need to start a fire each 5 min to stay alive. mayor problem imo. but yee. the new map update is rly good and i hope you guys keep it up the way you are now.fix the laten on mouse and the cold system and im back playing			"

								At this stage I would suggest avoiding.The graphics are medioocre at bet.The controls are clunky.The seems to be very little to do.You wake up in a cell, pickup a screwdriver and lighter, move to the door and its says ""cannot open it!' ""Cannot open it"" ""Cannot open it"" . . . . . .. Then I restart the game and do exactly the same thing and this time he CAN open the door ??/Then you wander aimless around the prison until you find the tunnel that goes outside.  No real game play so far!Outside you wander around some more, maybe find a can opener or some other useless item, until a bear or wolf comes along and kills you.I've yet to find anything of significance such as a weapon . . . ..The game itself runs okay, I suppose, but the graphics and general controls are average at best at this stage.On the store page the developers state “Our game is almost in a finished state. . . . .""  I truly hate to think that that is the case.  This game seems barely in ALPHA stage....In a nut shell the basic problems with this game are:Poor graphics, both in models and rendering.Poor controls, mediocre responce time, very basic controls.Limited content.  A few areas of interenst but no real playability value in them.Poor performance all round. Very choppy at times, slow response, stuttering animations etc. (I run an i7 with 16 GB ram and an R9 graphics, with SSDs etc.)Hopefully it will improve with time but at this stage its boring, and not worth the time or money; AND is FAR from being ""ALMOST IN A FINISHED STATE!""

Early Access Review
								EDIT: Unfortunately, as I thought, this game has floundered. Positive review changed to negative.Recommended at this price, but VERY early and unfinished. I'm not convinced the developer will support the game into a ""finished"" state; it may very well go the route of other Early Access survival games, and be interesting + full of potential but ultimately never achieve what it should've, and eventually be abandoned or have development slow to a crawl with tons of bugs a la The WarZ or a half-dozen other games in the genre. The developer stating:“Our game is almost in a finished state...“The game will stay in Early Access until we have a final polished version of it for PC, Mac and Linux. Probably a six months of polishing with the community feedback.”worries me the most. In my mind, there's no way that's achievable. If their plan is to push it out the door within 6 months, then the game will certainly have issues.With that said, it's fun and promising, and for $5.50 CAD, it's worth a shot.My first spawn/life:Within 30 seconds of spawning I ran into a British guy named Tim clearing out a couple buildings. I told him over voice chat that I had just spawned and was new to the game. He gave me a backpack and some other stuff, and asked if I wanted to group up. I was like sure, so off we went looting buildings and♥♥♥♥♥♥ I found a rifle, and Tim happened to have some ammo for it, so he gave it to me.Eventually he afks for a sec or something, but while he's gone I realize I'm critically dehydrated, so I leave him in search of water. About 5 minutes later quite some distance away from where I left him, I overheard two people talking - one of them was Tim, and the other some random guy. They had just run into each other, and while they were being cautious neither was KoSing. So I'm still desperate for water, so I take aim from some shrubbery at the random guy, and headshot him. Tim starts freaking out, cuz he doesn't realize it's me, until I tell him on voice coms. then we looted the guy's corpse, and I got the water I needed.So we went off again clearing buildings. I went into one, got shot once in the back as I stepped through a doorway, spun around and got 1 shot off, but then got hit again and died. Tim went in to investigate, and he swiftly got domed as well.Initial impressions:The game is still painfully early on, but it shows potential. On the Steam Early Access store page, they say they're aiming at full release within six months. This is absolutely not a reasonable goal, considering how glaring some of the issues are. The game needs a LOT of work and polish, but I'm having fun despite the issues.Some of the problems I ran into:The UI is♥♥♥♥♥♥ total crap. There's no in-game settings screen. You set your graphics options pre-launch ranging from Fastest to Fantastic, with no detailed options at all. No volume sliders or anything. I think you can rebind some keys out of game, but again not ingame, and as far as I can tell it's quite limited (no hold ADS or crouch, just toggle, etc.). The inventory system is unintuitive and filled with typos and Engrish (or whatever the Russian equivalent of that is). No way to change mouse sensitivity. That's a big one for me. No way to turn off headbob, which I really, really hate.It's kinda buggy sometimes. If your inventory is 1 spot from full and you try to pick up two items in quick succession, you pick up the first and instead of being unable to pick up the second, it just vanishes into the ether. I lost a couple guns this way. As far as I can tell, you can hold 3 weapons at a time, but you can only access 2 of them. Like, you literally can't swap to the third. You can't choose which two. You have to drop one of them to use the third. This might just be an issue with pistols, not sure yet.Engrish, lack of options, lack of accessibility. No user list to see who's currently in a server, only a total number count. No friends list or social options at all. When you're mildly thirsty, it says LowThristy (yes, that's thristy not thirsty).Confusing/unexplained items. Lots of items that combine with each other, but there's no indication of what combines with what or what an item actually does. For instance, radio/walkie talkie - initially had no battery. I found a battery and combined the two. Now the radio has a battery. Still not a clue how to use it or what its actual ingame function is. Lots of items that I had no idea wtf they were or what they did. There are different drinks/foods in the game, and they seem to have a varying amount of uses/amount of hunger/thirst replenished, but those numbers aren't indicated ingame. There are helmets and different types of clothing (and I think maybe armor too) but as far as I can tell they didn't say what they really did in terms of warmth or protection. Perhaps they're just cosmetic, but idk.Speaking of, anything ""on"" you and not in your bag (clothes, helmet, hat, guns, bat, axe, etc.) doesn't show up on your inventory to interact with. It shows up on a playermodel that's open when your inventory is, but as far as I can tell you can't actually change stuff - or maybe you can and the interface is so poor I just couldn't figure it out. For example, if you pick up a shirt you automatically put it on. afaik, you can't drop that shirt on the ground unless you pick up another shirt (which is again, automatically put on and your current one drops.)Unexplained game mechanics; I died of hypothermia. I had a lighter and gasoline on me, tried combining the two, couldn't figure out how to make a fire. Maybe I need wood or something as well, but I didn't find any of that. I didn't know what to look for. oh, and when I died - you get a 60 second respawn timer, and during that time you can't do anything. You can't open the menu to quit the game, even.Despite these types of gripes, I still had fun playing it. I've put a couple hours into it so far, and I'm definitely going to play more. I'm looking forward to some of the kinks getting sorted out. I know I've focused a lot more on the negative than the positive, but it really is quite entertaining. and at the pricepoint, even if it were completely terrible it wouldn't be a huge deal.As an Early Access game, I'm having fun with it knowing what it is, and I'm looking forward to the game being made better. At the pricepoint, with those things in mind, it's worth it. However, if this is approximately what the game launches as, with all the bugs and issues it currently has - then I'd say steer clear.

I hope the Devs will come back and finnish the game because it is in Early Access at the moment. It is a very good game though but there are also quite a bit of cheaters. So they should use a Anti-Cheat like Easy Anti Cheat or Battle-Eye should be good. But sorry I can't recommend it because the amount of cheaters and since the Devs have abandoned it.Why Devs it had so much potential it was such a good game.			"

								Game has potential just as all these kind of games do! just non succeed! Devs update this game alot. Game is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the moment however with all the updates that have been happening im sure in a month or 2 this game will be much more advanced as its very basic at the moment. Not many friendly players on they just seem to see and shoot.i would reccomend this game due to the frequent updates.____Update: Abandoned by devs!			"

								This is a nice game for its price. But before you buy you should know the developers abandoned the game. That means no more updates. This game has loot spawn inbalances and weapons are hard to use and find. But for $5 its a pretty good game. If you play during the day when there are more players you will definitely have some interactions with them. Most will be fights because nobody uses their mic. But overall it is realistic and fun.

								It is a good price it has Cars and Helicopters which and it is very fun. But the Devs haven't done any updates or announcements in a long time. I hope the Devs will come back and finnish the game because it is in Early Access at the moment. It is a very good game though but there are also quite a bit of cheaters. So they should use a Anti-Cheat like Easy Anti Cheat or Battle-Eye should be good. But sorry I can't recommend it because the amount of cheaters and since the Devs have abandoned it.Why Devs it had so much potential it was such a good game.			"
