												What if the person you planned to spend the rest of your life with suddenly, abruptly, really soon like, forgot who you are because of a car accident?  Same here, I don’t have no money for doctor bills. It’s time to dump em’ and find a new squeeze. You play as this red head chick who is hella randy and it is your job to make her experience “true love.” That’s right guys, no knockers, no hooters, no lady berries, and no love buttons. This chick keeps her shirt on the whole time and the guys don’t pressure her to put out. Not only does this take away from the realism (‘cause the libido of anime dudes IS real) but one potential love interest is a shy guy with glasses. THE SHY GUY WITH GLASSES DOES NOT GET FRIEND ZONED BY DEFAULT. I couldn’t believe it either. I did everything in my power to put this fool in his place, but then I… fell in love with him.His long hair glistened in the sun and this was accentuated by his inability to shower because his hair retained its natural oils. When his baggy bloodshot eyes met mine I looked away of course. When I looked back to see if he was still staring at me, he was. It was like his eyes never left me.  That he would never leave me. This game completes me. 10/10			"

												This game has its flaws, but if you can look past them it's a nice playing experience. Great art, nice characters, dramatic, but realistic enough backstory and 9 different kind of endings (if you count 'alone' ending to be one). Music is also nice, but for my taste maybe a little too repetitive. After all, it's a really beautiful and kind of cute game. How ever there is a big problem with this game. After a little while playing it really starts to repeat itself, like REALLY repeat. When you become familiar with how all of it works you're just basicly waiting for some random events to trigger and your friendship to increase with your chosen character. Also you have to know who you are going after from the day one in this game. Otherwise you'll just run out of time and end up getting alone ending. I can't say much about endings, because I haven't played all of them yet. But from what I've seen... they're not that strong and feel kind of flat. But well, after all I still must say that it's okey game. I've played better visual novels before, but can't really say it's bad either. If you like visual novels then I'd say give it a try.			"

												This game is just bad.... More details, seriously? Morbidly curious, huh?Well, alright. First stop aesthetic. It's bland, no personality, nothing that stands out compared with every other visual novel on the market. Now it's not ugly either but that's not quite good enough to be able to support the awful story.I mean, there is nothing to salvage here. It starts stupidly, continue stupider and finish in the stupidest fashion possible.You have to perform repetitive actions every day which doesn't bring anything to the overall experience and just artificially lengthen the playing time.The characters are all the worst version of a anime cliché possible. The dialogues are trash. I know it sounds harsh, but trust me, playing this game is harsher. There is not even a worthwhile decision to be made.Look, if you played and loved every visual novel in the world and have zero expectation, maybe consider it for bundle price. Otherwise run away.

Footfalls echo in the memoryDown the passage which we did not takeTowards the door we never opened~T.S. EliotThis is the first visual novel that I've played from Winter Wolves, and I must say that I'm not impressed. Always Remember Me is an otome game with a somewhat ordinary concept, annoyingly stereotypical characters, suicidally repetitive choice actions and a scarcity of events about the main story to keep you interested. At this point, I must confess that I've completed my first playthrough quite easily and gave in a reaction of ""seriously?"" at the first ending that I've discovered. During my second playthrough... I got bored and wandered off to do something else, forgetting the game running. When I remembered that I was playing the game, I came back and gave in 2 more hours of the gameplay to collect the missing achievements - a.k.a. fast-forwarded through some repetitive actions and only read event dialogues. Thus, my gaming time.Let me introduce you to Amarantha - called as Amy by friends - literature student, part time worker in an ice-cream parlor and a boringly plain young woman that you could define in 3 adjectives completely: fickle, stereotypical and automated. At the start of our gameplay, Amy has a motorcycle accident alongside her boyfriend Aaron - which fills in the young, rich and handsome stereotype. Amy survives with some moderate wounds but alongside a slight concussion, Aaron now has amnesia. He doesn't remember a thing about Amy. At this point, it is up to us to either patiently wait by our amnesiac boyfriend to help him regain his memories or run after a limited selection of other handsome young man who might become equally interested with us - namely Lawrence, Eddie and Hugh; appropriately filling in the shy cutie, the workaholic overachiever and the charming artist stereotypes in that order.So... As you may observe, our heroine hypothetically overcomes the trauma of losing ""the love of her life"" quite easily. She - and any other cute boy that she may end up with - are written really badly. They all consist of stereotypes with shallow reactions, superficial dialogue options and boringly unimaginative personalities. One could claim that I shouldn't expect much literary narrative or originality from an otome game to begin with, but without the visual novel quality of an interesting story or interesting enough characters - or at least decent narrative - I most certainly see no reason to spare my time specifically to experience a couple cute pictures of pretty anime characters kissing and some really lame dialogue note at the side. Sorry, but this is what the game eventually ends up being so.For the gameplay: you have 4 romance options, 4 stats that you can raise through completing more or less the same actions for a period of 3 months. Each stat concerns one of the romance option as a target. You wake up, work in the parlor, visit the romance option, raise stats with a limited selection of actions, sleep and repeat. Oh, and once in a while you stumble upon an event where you'll get a relationship raise if you are to choose the right one in the dialogue options. Eventually, you hit an ending for the boy that you picked, witness a cheesy ""happily ever after"" scene and carry on. Nothing else. No surprise factor, no real challenge, no in-depth story. Nothing. You repeat the same action for the millionth time while getting harassed by the endless repetition of the same 8 note soundtrack to be rewarded by a cute picture and 3-4 sentences telling how happy you ended up. Brilliant.Many would blame me to already know what I would get myself involved with when I picked an otome game to play, but with games from Cheritz or Hanako Games of the same genre in the market, you really should skip this if you are not getting it in a bundle, like super cheap. Else, consistently avoid this one to enjoy another VN or otome with more imaginative gameplay or at least better character concepts and/or story.Please also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!

												Eat, sleep, work, read your amnesian boyfriend books - repeatThis has to be the first Winter Wolves game which really annoys me.For a Visual novel the story/characters are really thin, your progress through it is nearly non existant, which in the end makes a repetetive grind through the always same few stations  you have in the game with always the same actions and nearly no story progress.Mix to this a similiar annoying music background and you have a really bland gaming experience.Short review, but there isn´t much more to this game.

												All my other reviews are jokes, but I really can’t joke about this game. It’s a dating sim that seems like a cute way to pass the time but in the end just feels like a whole repetitive exercise about how much you can read into non-existent conversations and relationships with little foundation.Always Remember Me is quick to use all the big heart-tugging elements, with a somewhat forbidden relationship, a protagonist with dead parents, an amnesiac boyfriend, a manipulative ex-girlfriend, and even a struggling humanities student who is just trying to pay her tuition. The story is all very heavy-handed, never really bothering to get into the ""why"" or ""how"" of anything or anyone. But that doesn't really matter anyway, since scenes are so few and far between – and so incredibly brief when they even happen – that the story barely exists. It's not uncommon for Always Remember Me to just skip scenes altogether, passing over entire conversations and evenings out, and swiftly arriving at the ending, leaving you to fill in any romance or, well, anything at all that happened.The sim elements feel pretty unnecessary. On easy difficulty you can spam the activity that gives you the most stats, while on harder difficulties you scramble around to figure out a strategy. The emphasis seems to be more on the “sim” element than the “dating”, and for that it’s not too fun. The relationship building part of the game doesn’t feel substantial, and if the overall aim is to grind numbers for those parts then I have to ask what purpose it serves, or if the result even makes up for the grind.At the end of the day, Always Remember Me isn't a bad game, it just falls flat on effort in the wrong places. The plot relies on shallow dramatic backstory to give characters a false sense of depth while the gameplay is a pure grind and almost without purpose. For me, there’s not enough payoff to justify grinding through numbers to reach an ending, and that makes this game a really dull experience.			"

												As a huge fan of dating sims, I've already experienced many different types of Otome Games / Visual Novels and yet, I have to say that I was quite disappointed by Always Remember Me. I had some expectations before playing this game since the visuals seemed fairly appealing and I actually wasn't disappointed by the (few) CGs - they were drawn well and the character designs weren't bad either. But that's it, everything else made me - bluntly said - dislike the game.The characters' sprites during the cutscenes looked weird (e.g. when Amy cried her posture/gesture didn't change at all, her posture stayed the same throughout the game and the same with the other characters). Additionally, the game seemed to focus more on the stat raising mechanic than the romance plot itself, leading to some annoying and boring ""save & load"" back and forth since you want to raise your stats as soon as possible in order to get both endings easily. Lastly, the endings to every route in this game. Briefly said, they were also very disappointing. A short cutscene with CG as a reward and during those cutscenes, you couldn't really feel the love between the protagonist and her final love interest - you just couldn't feel this achievement which you want to have as the player in every dating sim. All in all, I'm glad they took another step forward to localising dating sims in the west and I don't regret buying ARM since it helped supporting the localisation. Still, I probably wouldn't have bought it for another reason.			"

												After finishing the main guy's route, I didn't feel compelled to continue playing any of the other routes. It felt bland, uninspired and didn't leave much of an impression on me. It's superficial at best and it's all about stat raising and not enough story.  Though the art looks well done it's additionally let down by the UI which I firmly disliked and didn't allow me to fully immerse myself in it. Everything is cookie-cutter and failed to employ cliches effectively and I won't be looking forward to any Winter Wolves games in the future.			"

												While you were riding the motorcycle with your boyfriend, you have a traffic accident. Your boyfriend tries to protect you and ends up with a head injury and amnesia. He has no memory of you. So far it sounds okay.  But the problem with the game is, it quickly turns into endless stat grinding. You have to do the same things and visit the same places trying to increase your stats and relationship points.Pros:+ Nice artstyle+ Nothing else I can think of :DCons:+ It lacks decent storyline and conversations.+ Game is mostly about grinding stats and it becomes boring real fast.

												Alright, before I begin I would like to state that I specifically held off on writing a review for this game until AFTER I had finished every route this game had to offer (100%'d it) in hopes that It would help change my mind on how bad this game really was. Unfortunately It didn't, and as a matter of fact, I could even go as far as saying I dislike it even more now that I have.First of all, this game should not have the privilege of being categorized as a dating sim but rather as a ice cream shop sim since that's what you do for literally half of the game which becomes more and more tedious the more you play the game since it limits your progress to 1/4th the speed. In fact, if you were to take all of the useless grinding for money and stat boosting, the game would be cut down to 10 min per route.. Max.Another bad point of this game is the fact that you have to deal with the most annoying game soundtrack I have probably heard so far, not only does it not suit the game at all, but it also plays in a loop over and over again which becomes highly annoying and sure, you could argue how muting the sound would probably fix that issue but it only makes it really awkward and boring. I would also like to point out the fact that I’m not touching the sound effects, or the lack there of, since I could talk about them for days.. woohoooooooooooo!!11+Fun fact: This game is heavily Rng based meaning you will continuously find yourself talking to one of the male protagonists and not making any progress at all for days on end.Lastly this ""game"" is definitely not worth 18 dollars, the thought of it even being worth more that 10 is ridiculous to say the least. If you want a really good dating game go purchase “Hatoful Boyfriend” which has great replay-ability (Which is a game I will be doing a review of later) and also has characters you can end up connecting with. You will also save 8 dollars which you can save to your steam wallet or buy some other game with. Now, I bought this game in a bundle so I got my money’s worth, but i would advice not to get this unless it's in one again. This game would only be suitable for huge fans of dating sims or hardcore game collectors such as myselfIn conclusion.. I wouldn't recommend this game even if i was getting paid to do so. I rate it a 10/10 - IGN			"

												I enjoyed this vn/otome..but there were some major flaws that made it all just feel a little lacking. The ending was the biggest flaw. I got both the special and normal ending for Eddy and I felt zero difference between the two. There also was absolutely no build up to the ending. The male characters just sort of eventually confess to Amy, with not much having happened between them since this game focuses just a little, little too much on stat building...and then the player is left a little confused as to whether or not Amy is actually dating the love interest (because even if a different guy confesses to hear and she says something like ""I think I have feelings for you, too"", she still visits her boyfriend with Amnesia at the hospital and gets upset when his ex girlfriend is there). After that, once you either fill the 'love meter' or play up until the 'deadline', it just skips straight to a short ending scene with your hubby without any build up or conflict in the story (besides the whole amnesia storyline).Despite all of this, I did very much like three of the love interests. The boyfriend with amnesia was a little too plain to be so much trouble for my tastes..but these bishies were still interesting and the sort that plenty of people can get attached to (such as myself).Amy, the heroine, is also very likable and the game has fantastic artwork (not to mention a fairly nice soundtrack which I better liked by purchasing the deluxe edition of the game).All in all, not the greatest otome and it didn't handle the stat building particularily well (and I think the new game Backstage Pass did a better job of that..), but it was cute and charming. It just is NOT the sort of thing if you've played a lot of visual novels or otome games. There's  very little text and it's mostly stat building (which is great if you prefer it that way..I just am used to reading a lot and making tough decisions in my vn's and otomes).			"

												Always Remember Me is a nice dating sim, starring a female protagonist.As those familiar with the genre would expect, after a brief set of introductory events the game gives you nearly complete freedom of what to do and whom to meet. There are only four potential romantic partners, though they are fairly well-detailed and likable. Protagonist herself, Amy also gets a lot of characterization rather than just being a stand-in for the player. And your every action, successful or not, gets a description of how it went, done in Amy’s quirky style!Also as expected of a dating sim, your character has several stats, and doing your daily job for money as well as variety of activities to increase one or more stat is integral part of the gameplay.Storytelling-wise, there are some lovely moments, but nothing truly touched me as some moments in other visual novels and dating sims did. Overall, I enjoyed the story well enough, although I wouldn’t call it that great either.I can recommend Always Remember Me to all fans of dating sims. And those unfamiliar with this genre but interested in a nice casual game may consider giving it a try as well.			"

												Always Remember Me is telling the story of Amy, whose boyfriend got into an accident and doesn't remember her. You follow her life through her summer work and her hobbies. It's up to you to choose if she will make Aaron (her boyfriend) fall in love with her again or if she will find love elsewhere.You have Lawrence, her coworker, Hugh, the stylist and Eddy, the doctor that can replace Aaron in her heart, however, to unlock a romance ending (or the special romance), you'll have to have a very good relationship with the chosen one and the main characteristic that will unlock the special ending at a highest rate. For example, everything related to sport will help you for Eddy while the creativity will be useful for Hugh.You choose your activity and how you spend your money but keep in mind that the game will be repetitive. Always Remember Me, after a while, is boring as you're only upping the stats you want and do the same activity each day and you try to improve the relationship.While the graphics are correct, the soundtrack is very very good, like the main song.On the other side, it has a lot of replayability as you want to see the other endings, despite the repetitive gameplay.Always Remember Me stays a nice VN, though I would buy it in a bundle or discounted.

												When I first saw this game I must confess I made fun of it. I mean, a lot. Turns out a friend of mine gave me the game as a gift (his idea of a prank) and I thought I might play it as well. I found out I was wrong about it.Although its not really the style of game I'm used to playing, I may say that the experience was quite enjoyable. The story is well written, although the overall game writing could use some more work (only a few outcomes to the actions you perform, making it a bit repetitive). The gameplay may feel a bit boring, specially because actual story parts only come up once a week and you will find yourself performing the same actions over and over again until an opportunity appears, but the moments you actually do something different make up for it. The soundtrack is not bad and suits the game just fine. I recommend people actually give this game a try before they say it's bad. It's not bad, just a different and fun way to pass the time if you have nothing else to do or feel tired of slashing and shooting stuff. Still, the issues I mentioned may let some people down and kind of annoyed me throughout my gameplay so I'll give it a 7/10.			"

												If you love skipping inane dialogue and clicking the same activities hundreds of times just to get a miserably unsatisfying ending, this is the game for you. If you want an actual visual ""novel"" with, like, writing that doesn't repeat itself a trillion times and has the same quality as a Newgrounds flash game (not an exaggeration in the least), maybe with voice acting or decent music or meaningful event sequences, maybe even some animation--forget it, it's not there.Don't be sucked in by the good premise. It goes absolutely nowhere. I love VNs and I love story-based games, and dating sims can be done well. There's almost no writing, and all of it is atrocious. Nothing works. The art never changes, the activities don't change, the events repeat hundreds of times, and reaching an ending is nothing more than repeating the same actions over and over and over again. It's not fun, and it doesn't lead to anything interesting at any point.Not even Cristina Vee singing the game's theme song can save it. The best part of the game is the title screen and the intro. Beyond that, don't expect anything better. I'm serious, I'm super-forgiving when it comes to this, but this is absolutely no deeper than a standard flash game. There's about as much dialogue and content as there.			"

												As far as dating sims/otome games go this is a simple one ( For those who are wondering there is NO +18 Content.) + sweet story+ catchy soundtrack + two possible endings a special and normal ending. + Skills / Parameters determine outcome.  Some of the things I didnt enjoy about this game are :- It becomes repetetive way too fast. (click after click of doing the same thing )- The random event are sweet but they lacked visual aspects to them to make them satisfying.- The options (at least for me) hardly changed the outcome or made a big significant change. - Feels like a flash game.Overall it is a sweet game, and would recommend it for casual dating sim players or anyone who is 13+ (teens) there is no explicit language or content as far from kissing and hugging so pretty pink and sweet. **For anyone who is experienced with Otome/ Dating Sim games this is not your game. You will ended fairly quickly and will get bored from it quite fast and just get really annoyed at some characters in the game.			"

												It was interesting to see stats incorporated into a VN. I know a few titles that have done this before but I've never had the chance to try them out.Unfortunately, a balance needs to be struck when this comes into play. The game is too repetitive seeing as the options to raise the 4 stats are very limited. I went for the Eddy special ending and I barely used the gym. It turned out that blogging had a higher success rate for raising 2 discipline instead of 1. By the second half of the playthrough, I was watching TV all day just to pass the time and get to the next day (to progress things with Eddy).Something else which bothered me was how cookie-cutter the males were. Aaron bored me to death and Lawrence is a huge drama queen. This part is purely subjective but out of the ordinary characters would have made this game 3x better.2/5			"

Always Remember me is the sequel to the ground-breaking AAA title Remember Me from Dontnod Entertainment published by Capcom... Actually, Always Remember Me was made by Winter Wolves, a studio known for making exclusively Visual Novels. I let you know my experience with VNs is rather thin, so your opinion may vary. Again, this is a fresh VNoob review, so keep that in mind.So let's start. The story. If this game was a first-person shooter or casual hack and slash, we wouldn't have to comment on that. However, this is a Visual NOVEL, so we definitely have to focus on this aspect. You play as Amy, a girl who has gone through despair after her boyfriend was diagnosed with amnesia, not remembering anything from their past relationship. As Amy you will be working part time, visiting Aaron, the aforementioned boyfriend, and trying to make him remember or worst case scenario: make him fall in love with you again. But is that really the best for both of you... ? Overall I found the story being full of cliches, however enjoyable nonetheless. With characters being well written and surprisingly deep.The gameplay. You will be also doing various activities expanding one of four of your traits: Culture, Creativity, Romance and Discipline. These are also gained by interacting with one of your four potential love interests. Having maxed out the particular stat needed for the certain partner unlocks the 'special ending'. As you grow familiar with your partner more special events are unlocked, in which you are forced to make a choice that will either advance your relationship or do the opposite. You will find yourself awaiting these events with curiosity and excitement, partly because your daily routine will get boring eventually. The first playthrough may not wield results and you will probably do a second one. And that's okay, the replayability value here is surprisingly high. You may want to turn text and animation speed up, but you will still have fun exploring the other optio... I mean guys. The visuals.The artstyle is your typical anime stylization. However the proportions belong to the more realistic half of this particular artstyle. Overflowing with vibrant colors and interesting character choices your eyes will definitely not go dry. The animation and city map is nothing particularly impressive, but it fullfils it's purpose. All the work certainly went into the characters and backgrounds. The font is annoying, but typical for VNs, however there are many well stylized VNs out there. Overall, I wouldn't have played it for +5 hours if I was bothered by the visuals, so this is definitely a plus for the game.The soundtrack.A quite rare aspect in reviews, however I always like to mention them, especially in games such as these. They represent a major part of the narrative and usually expand the experience. Not here. More or less. It is catchy, don't get me wrong, it certainly is. I've been listening to the opening the whole time I wrote this review and I had no urge to turn it down whatsoever. The in-game music gives a very casual vibe, something you should grow familiar if watching sitcoms and other family-friendly shows. It just doesn't leave a mark in my memory (guess I will not Always Remember It, haha). Unlike the game itself it is enjoyable while it lasts, but once you're done you won't feel obligated to pick it up again. The bonus 'remix' of the main theme song is a fun gimmick and amusing, but it does not feel particularly memorable as well. And now we got to the end of this review. The final question: Should you buy it or should you not? Well, strongly depends on your preferences. If you're looking for a dramatic heart-tearing ride, you won't find it here. It's a lighthearted and fairly casual experience and the story is pretty straightforward and linear. I don't think it needs heavy plot-twists anyways. You will enjoy this game as it is if you're looking for something fun to pick up and try. I myself had high expectations and wasn't dissapointed, but again, your mileage may vary. It is certaily an enjoyable game and immensively fun if you can just ease yourself off after a hard day and want to kill time. I highly recommend this to you as a gateway visual novel if you want to get into this genre. "

												Pros:-nice artCons:-steep price for what it is ($19 for deluxe)-dull ""gameplay""-really poor writing-music not especially gripping-much more of a visual novel than sim game.I'm not a dating sim person, I bought this to play along with a friend on twitch.tv who's into these kinds of games.  That said, I came into this with an open mind, but unfortunately I just can't see any redeeming qualities here.  The writing is flat out terrible, very amature level stuff.  The music is pretty bland (and I paid extra for the soundtrack) and the gameplay is DULL (if you can even call it gameplay).  It's more of a click-and-read-along story, and occiasionally you get to specify what activity you want to do, with apparently random results that require no action or effort from the player.I'm not opposed to dating sims by any stretch, but if you want to build relationships within a game, companies like Tell Tale and BioWare did it much better.  And while I realize those aren't exactly apples-to-apples comparisons, I think it's fair to demand better writing and character interaction from a game that is essentially 100% text based, and maybe expect just a little more to engage the player rather than occasionally clicking a choice here and there.I'm sure I'm not the original intended demographic for the game, but I like to think I'm objective enough, and sadly that's the best I can say about this.  That said, I'm sure many will enjoy this game for what it is, and that's fine.I hope this information is useful.			"

												Even though “Always Remember Me” has a ton of negative reviews, I bought it on sale thinking it can’t be all that bad. At $5 I was still disappointed.Pros:Pretty graphicsInteresting premiseCons:Very few cutscenes between monotonous stat-raisingCharacters are very shallow, no real depthRelationships feel forced, it tells us instead of shows us the important moments (like Aaron regaining his memories or having him fall for her the first time.)*You can easily miss cutscenes if you don’t go to a specific place at a certain time*I only played through the Aaron route, so I can’t say for sure about the other guys. But this is what Aaron’s route felt like, so I didn’t want to bother with the other guys.			"

												Okay, lets get this straight. For £12-£14, this game is seriously not worth it. All you do all game is grind. You grind to get money for your laptop, dress, plushie and books. You grind to increase your relatonships points by 1 each time. You get no story apart from the intro. I did this game first in easy mode to get a feel, I need 100 points to get an ending. Any ending at all. With any of the love interests. It's so rediculously hard to get that high. Because you're supposed to be living this girl's life. She has a job, she has interests. You're not supposed to be turning her into a psycho stalker that spends every.waking.moment talking to this guy (whoever you chose) Cause what about the Morale and energy you have to keep tabs on? If you don't, money dwindles. I love visual novels. Any one I see, I try to get. Despite not having much money most of the time. Don't waste your time or money on this one. The developer should be ashamed. I agree with steam greenlight and everything since it gives smaller developers a chance to make it. But when you get pathetic pieces like this turn up and try to take your money. It turns the whole concept into a joke.			"

												I've been trying a few of these dating games recently. I bought a bundle and it happened to have some with it.This is the worst one I've played so far. The personalities of possible suitors are flat at best. Your ex-boyfriend is a simpering wimp and the rest aren't that great either. There is no connection between the partners and the game lacks a proper build up. The effect suggests that the protagonist suffers from some form of dependent personality disorder. She simply cannot be alone and will fling herself to the first man that will have her. Mechanically the game suffers from excessive randomness. How much you earn from your job is almost utterly random. your ability to gain skills is also far too random. In order to get your skill high enough to get the special ending be prepared to save and load enough times to get a repetitive strain injury. The game fails at the most basic level. Random mechanics, weak characters and doesn't do romance very well.Skip this game.  "

												The game is really repetitive in terms of action without enough actual dialogs and scenes to be a proper visual novel.  There aren't really any choices to make during the game but one, straight from the beginning: who to date? And the choice is given at the beginning, before the actual start of the game, as long as the key attribute to level to get to the ""special ending"" that is not brought really step by step, just comes from ""It's nice to visit"" to ""we'll spend the rest of our life together"" in a blink. I'd pay a few euros to play the game, but for this price, it is disappointing.			"

												Enjoyable gameplay and a very sweet story! The flags needed for each character are made clear at the beginning, so it's very simple to romance whomever you've decided (but really everyone should be picking Aaron anyways ;D ). The art and music are also very well done. As others have mentioned, your actions do get a little repetitive once you figure out what works best, but it didn't bother me.On a side note, I'm happy to see that more people are starting to release romance games on Steam!

												I love life sim and dating sim games, however this one felt so shallow. You never really got to know the main character (whose name is Amarantha...what?), or any of the characters really, they all just comes off as very bland.I have finished the game twice, once with the alone ending and another with the normal ending. Both endings were equally uninspiring and in both endings there was text referring to past events that never occurred in my games.The music was repetitive and got super annoying after a while, not to mention the opening song had very grating vocals.To put the icing on the cake (or the sprinkles on the ice cream if we want to stay with Always Remember Me's theme) the little comics in the extras section were completely cringe worthy. ""I LOVE YOU!"", ""Oh noes!"". Please stop with the poor attempts at humour and the out of date internet slang, as a reader I actually felt second hand embarrassment.With the exception of the chibis the art was pleasing so that's one thing this game had going for it.I hate to sound so negative but there really wasn't much I enjoyed about this game. For a story that has so much to do with writing it's kind of sad how poor the plot/dialogue is, however I acknowledge that writing fiction is difficult, especially when there are multiple endings. I hope that the writer puts in more practice and tries again, I just don't think I'll be spending money on their next attempt.			"

												I wanted to recommend this game. But seriously… I can’t.The art style is pretty, the backgrounds were also pretty.. But the characters lack emotions and personality. Everything is just.. Plain. Simple. Waaaay too simple… The story itself was kinda cliché but I tried to give it a chance. I regret my previous decision…There are irrelevant characters (like Amy’s aunt), and to be honest, it’s all about status raising. I’m not a fan myself of games like that but depending on the stories, characters and events, it can be done right. But Always Remember Me lacks ALL THAT. The events (where you know, you can actually interact with the character you want to date) are so short and they happen so rarely. And they are just.. Bad. Too simple. You can’t feel a connection between the characters. The endings, both normal and special, are too fast and… Meh. I honestly cleared the whole game just because I wanted all the achievements. :-/Oh, and there’s the music. It’s not bad, honestly. But it plays so often and SO LOUD that it pierces my ears and makes my brain scream in agony. Also the instrumental version (or whatever version that suddenly plays when you’re going to the icecream shop) sounds so out of place. Makes no sense, I don’t know how to explain… And the main song keeps playing over and over, at weird times and… Jesus. What a mess. 3/10. I only gave 3 points because the art style, like I said, is actually pretty. This could have been a good or at least decent game, but unfortunately… It isn’t. It’s bad. Ain’t worth even on sale.			"

												There would not be a chance in hell that I would recommend this to anyone - trying to sit though this thing and record a let's play for YouTube is just sucking me dry because of how uninteresting the whole thing is. It doesn't help that the main character failed to engage me at all so I find it impossible to actually care weather she gets back into a relationship or not. The other characters are pretty paper thin too and only have a few quirks about them, so ultimately they're pretty dull too.The sim elements that are in the game that can be trained are really uninspired and they're really just another relationship meter for specific love interests (For example: Aaron relates to the 'Romance' stat and Lawrence relates to the 'Culture' stat). There is really no need for them and it just seems to me that the developers just included them to give you the illusion of progression, when actually you're not and if you're not maxing a specific stat like Romance for Aaron you're wasting your ♥♥♥♥ing time. There are arguments about ""are video games art"", or somthing along those lines. I got a better one for you - ""Is Always Remember Me a game?"" Even if you're a big fan of VNs, this would not interest you. There are far better ways to waste £14 than actually playing this crap. With that much money I could either go to the local video game store and buy some real games, or maybe buy a extra large pizza with everything on top of it and share it with my pals, or maybe I might just buy a not very well writen, not at all engaging pile of nothing where the protaginist is just some boring girl trying to get her boring boyfriend to love her again and going through her boring daily routine every boring turn of her ultimately boring life.TL;DR - It's pointless, stupid and a woeful waste of good cash. Thank God that someone else bought it for me, so I can call him a dumbass for actually buying it.			"

												I've only played through both endings with Aaron and I had a blast playing through it. A good strategy to this game is developing a pattern, but before it gets too repetitive (for me at least), I end up either with a new event or having to work on getting Amy's energy back up. Even when I get held back by Amy's energy, I could easily get both routes finished in time. This game was extra fun playing while on Skype with someone as they did male voices and I did female voices, so if you wanna make this game extra enjoyable, get a friend to help with the voices. Also, some of the dialogue is a bit weird a certain points, but when you're doing voice overs, it's a ball of hilarity.			"

												One of the easiest games I`ve ever played, nice for beginners, but nothing new under the sun.Since the beginning of the game you do know which character likes which stat, you just have to visit them every day and learn the required skill to get a 100% romance. Decide, if you want to fight for your love (and stick with the one who forgot about you), or if you like to flirt with a doctor, a designer or a shy ice cream vendor. Love has never been so easy, yet so predictable as in this game.			"

												Developer Winter Wolves has done a lot of games of this type and this is the weakest grind fest this far. To make this really short there are two types of sins that games like this in my humble opinion must avoid:a) Grinding for points gone over the top. in this case going +1 steps (plus special events) towards 100 to 'unlock ending'.  Winter Wolves did this in Heileen series too and although it was sometimes a bit annoying the process of getting there was interesting events with clear choices so it worked for me. I consider them very good games on average. b) Save scumming and forcing the player to concentrate on one thing and one thing only to get a ending. This game is heavy on this - unless you consider it a 'splendid' idea that the game just 'awards' the player with the ability to re-play it again with increased point awards for activities.  Yeah, sure. like i have the motivation to start from scratch and this time 'only do activities x and y' over and over.  Just what is the intended audience of this game? min-maxers? 4/10.			"

												I would not recommend this game at full price. Maybe on sale. It was terribly repetitive. Very grindy. The mechanic, once figured out, is so simple it is easy to find all the ""hidden"" scenes. Maybe, just maybe if you were new to dating sim games and had no idea....it might be fun for more than an hour.The story was so full of common themes and tropes, the cup runneth over. Amnesia, no parents for the main character, the back-stabbing ex. It was all just so predictable.Not much imagination went into the art either. It was quite typical. There were several times when characters were having an important scene that the camera was focused on some irrelevant part of ONE picture. That is right, you work several hours just to get to a pan of one picture at the end. Or in the middle of a defining moment of dialouge the focus stays on a character...who isn't even speaking. A lot more care could have been taken with this. I mean this is supposed to be a heart-string-pulling anime inspired romance. How are you supposed to have your heart-strings pulled on with no character face to pull emotion from. It was very disappointing.In the end I played through all the endings just to see them. But I wouldn't even invite my friends over to try this one.			"

												After being gifted I gave this a try.  Can't say this was worth the time.The main aspects of a game like this would be the story.  Unfortuntaely the story is quit thin, likely due to the style of the game.  If you want story I'd recommend seeking an actual visual novel, this passes as a visual novel only in the sense it has pictures combined with limited writing.  Too bad really, the concept for the characters is bad so the material is there but loses the attention it needs.The gaming aspect as a stimulation is very unrewarding.  You're essentially doing cow clicker hoping to get the numbers you need so you can get the ending you want.  The randomness and difficulty settings (yep it has them) do nothing to enhance the game and feel like wasted mechanics here.Does have nice pictures and the occassional moments but these are lost in the lackluster stimulation.

												A pretty nice decent dating sim with pretty cute artwork. The story is a neat premise, the main character's boyfriend has amnesia so she can either stick it out with him or pursue three other dudes. The characters themselves aren't annoying, but they don't really stick out that much either. That's unfortunately because you don't actually get to see most of their personality unless you pursue them as a love interest and even then you only get a few choice-related events with them. Then again, maybe it was meant to be that way since they're suppose to be simple characters and not soap opera cliche characters. Although, its neat how the game incorporates morale and energy levels in it, and its pretty simple to figure out how to best balance out those stats. As far as this review goes, I've only played through Aaron's and Lawrences's normal and special endings. Aaron's special ending was the only ending from those four that had a smooth transition for its end relationship. The other four endings just pop up abruptly once you max out the guys' love meters, almost as if they were an after-thought in the story designing process. And I'm unsure if those endings take place right there or later on in the future. Don't get me wrong, I still had fun playing the game, but those ending transitions needs a bit of work. I'd recommend picking the game up when its on sale if you want a nice short dating sim.			"

												I keep forgetting to write a review for this because, despite the title, it's Always Forget About This Empty Game.  I'll summarize it using my notes from finishing the game's routes back then.If you want something short, sweet, but ultimately meaningless: Go for this game.If you want a more substantial VN/stat-raising game, go for something like Backstage Pass.Always Remember Me was nice on a shallow end, but ultimately not something I'd ever touch again unless it was simply to bust out the last achievement I failed to get for completion's sake, and I honestly don't feel it's worth it.  During earlier days when there was almost nothing substantial or worthwhile for otome game lovers to play, this was an option.  I simply don't think it's worth it anymore when there's infinitely better things to play these days, and I felt like I'd wasted my time even before that.There's some cute elements to this game, and one surprising one - I was surprised by the stalker subplot, but it's so tiny it hardly bears being called a subplot, and it could've been handled in a much more interesting way.TL;DR: Do not recommend.  There's better stuff out there, and unless the sequel to this game that just game out is a SIGNIFICANT improvement, there's no point in peeking at this one.			"

												I'd be hard pressed to find a game on Steam that would be less in line with my interests.  As a middle aged man who has no desire to romance pointy-chinned young men, I thought this would not appeal to me at all.  Of course, I was right, but it was in a bundle somewhere, and I run every game with cards till they drop.  With this in mind, here is my unbiased opinion.Always Remember Me was simple to install, and started right up when I pressed play.  It continued to run while I took a nap, got up and went to the store for some soup, then came home and ate the soup.  At this point I checked and saw that all of the cards had dropped, and uninstalled the game, which was also very easy.  I then filed the game into a folder, where it will sit for years to come.  Overall, I give Always Remember Me four out of five chins, only falling short of five due to the senseless violence and lacivious content whose absence prevented me from playing.			"

												This is an... interesting game. It seems to be one of Winter Wolves's earlier efforts, as it is slightly unpolished (compared to more recent titles). The plot is decent enough, as your character Amarantha (Amy) has just been in an accident with her boyfriend Aaron. Aaron protected her from most of the impact, at the cost of amnesia. Amnesia that wiped most of the last few years from his mind... including your relationship. Do you stick by him, or do you fall for someone else? (Think ""While You Were Sleeping"", except you actually were in the relationship.)I was unsure about this game for a while, but finally decided to try it, as Winter Wolves make some great visual novels. But I think this is a decent enough game to buy (though maybe wait until it is discounted).Also, note that it has a sequel ""Never Forget Me"", which likely makes the ""Happily Ever Afters"" of this game a bit... premature.

The artwork looks nice. And depending on the guy you choose the story invokes emotions. There were some parts where I felt sad. So the game did a great job on that. However, it's heavily focused on raising stats. Always Remember Me has a few elements that it lacks compared to other dating sim games. You can't really go out on dates with the guys, call them, etc. There's only one or two interactions with the guy. So after a while, days get kinda repeative. There is a small amount of scenes you can get with the guy. That's really about it. The amount of scenes/events with the guys and the amount of playtime the game gives you has a huge gap. I wish there was more scenes and interactions to do. But it's still a decent game nonetheless.  "

												I was lucky to receive this game in a bundle because to purchase it at its actual price, it  is not worth it. The first run through the game, especially the Aaron scenario, it isn't so bad. However, if you want to try other endings, it's an endless fest of grinding to acquire money and character skills, making it monotonous and very very boring. Out of the various scenarios, the best and most believable romance is the Aaron romance, whereas the other male characters' scenarios feel very forced and well poorly portrayed. In short, this game took too much time and wasn't worth it in the end.			"

												The main story is somewhat original but the characters and their relationships are too shallow for my taste. The gameplay is utterly repetitive and boring. I'm not used to female perspective in dating sims so it was a little awkward for me. A girl would definitely enjoy this game more than I did. If you want to play this that badly, I suggest you to get the mobile version and give it a go when you're on a long bus trip or something.			"

												This game is one of those cases when I wish I could choose a neutral rating. It's not stellar, but it's not bad either; still, I can't recommend it with clear conscience.First off, the story is nice, if bland. You won't remember it (pun... mostly intended) as something that gave you All The Feels, but it's cute enough to play through when you have some downtime. The characters are hardly complex, but mostly pleasing, and the dialogue seems fine, if you keep in mind that it's a short game without any deeper moments other than Aaron's amnesia (which presents an interesting situation that is handled okay, but could've been developed more).I also like the art well enough - I don't really see why some people seem to have a problem with it, since it's very nice imho and I've seen way, way worse sprites and CGs in some other VNs I played.There is, however, an issue that ultimately led me to the negative review: the game mechanics. I'm not talking about stat raising - an element which I personally hate, given how annoying it turns in every (however good) game, but I understand why it's used. I'm talking about the fact that key scenes with each of the characters trigger based on approval, but there's still a random element to WHEN you get them. That means that if you raise your relationship points (or other stats!) too quickly, you can easilly miss out on even scenes that are essential to each route. People playing otome games want to have their hard-earned confession scenes served on a silver plate, not accidentally skipped while only getting the happy epilogue. And yes, that happens in ARM - Lawrence's route is the best example.All in all, you might have fun with this game, but only if you are willing to pace your play carefully so you don't miss out on anything. And I definitely wouldn't get it for the full price; I bought it on sale (75% off) and that's about as much as the game is worth.			"

												Always Remember Me is less a VN than a stats sim. You spend a ton of time grinding through simple, repetitive actions only to get a few snippets of story that are maybe a few sentences long each, and are typically about something utterly mundane. With so little writing, there's no time to get invested in the characters, or even learn much about them at all.			"

												This is not a bad game yet it is not the best one I've seen, you have choices but after some time the game get boring and you'll probably give up on trying every single ending. You build your character and do some daily tasks and at this point it reminds me a RPG. The drawing is ok and story is good, you play as a teenager whose boyfriend had an accident and is suffering from amnesia, and your objective is to decide your future, if you date one of the characters or not and if so, which one.Fun fact: you have to compete with your boyfriend ex :pI still think you should be able to play as a male a chose your girlfriend but still...It doesn't worth the full price but still worth playing.

Also you do fun things and study to raise your levels, and make conversation to raise your relationship with guys. Also the game is casual so you can just relax and play this game. This is one of my favorite pc games by far and I would recommend buying it and te soundtrack. I'd give this game a 9.5/10			"

												+ Nice art. I really like the painterly style used. I purchased based on the art alone.+/- Ost is so-so. There was only 1 track that stood out to me. The instrumental theme song that comes on at random is really annoying.- The only voice option is the chibi protagonist's reaction to how well you performed a task. It becomes quite repetitive and annoying immediately, so I ended up muting it.- Horribly structured amnesia plot which makes the writing unrealistic. The intro leads into the main love interest's route, but for the sake of having other love interests, forces the MC to be a shallow person by abandoning him to date another character. The plot continually pushes the main love interest's involvement throughout the story as something important, when it doesn't have any direct impact to the other routes.- Huge lack of character development/character scenes. It makes the pacing of the game awful. I really feel like the scenes you get are randomized, because there is a screenshot in the community hub of a character that I have never run into in any of my playthroughs.- Endings felt more like quick epilogues with no real conclusion at the end. There were little differences between both route endings.- Stat grinding felt boring. Even being efficient with saving and reloading to get the most points in the shortest time was still a chore.- No incentive to do a harder difficulty. It's just not fun.			"

												It is so refreshing to see a game like this. I hope that Atlus picks it up. I've played similar games that were ""male orientated"" with ""special endings""; what I'm getting at it's a nice game for a Woman or a sensitive Man to play.EG: http://www.newgrounds.com/collection/datingsimsI would like to see this expanded on. When I say expanded I would like it to be either 3rd person or from first person and to have the world be 2 or 3D. Persona or Catherine is a good example. If a suitor gives her a gift it would be neat if it showed up in her room and she was able to replay the memory or have a mood boost.

												All you do is raise stats. I can't even get through one route because it's just so much grinding.. With an RNG aspect to it! Makes it even worse.I think otome games with stats can be done right, but this game is not an example of it. Raising your stats or even points for whatever guy takes up about 90% of the game. There are not that many scenes or much of a story to this game. And the plot is kinda lame as well. Not worth your money even if it's on sale.A+ art for the people though.			"

Overall, though, it is a very enjoyable story and I felt like the characters were well thought out and given proper personalities. 9/10, would get amnesia and play again.			"

												It's a dating simulation game .You play a teenager who'll have a scooter accident with her boyfriend, it's him who'll have to stay at the hospital. Waiting for his return you live your daily life with work, a few activities. You work on a romance with either a man among 3 or you try to make your boyfriend remember you. His ex will try to lure him so she's an enemy.Depending on who you want to romance you have to get an amount of points in a type of ability. Don't be exhausted or you'll progress less in earning abilities or do few job and get less paid.There's a rock song/video clip you can watch and sing as a bonus. There's a simple and another developed ending with each of the guy and an ""alone"" one.The game timing lasts 3-4 months, you have to respect it in earning the ability and pleasing your love in answering well to/ in front of him to get its ending!Overall it's a rather good game.

I was looking for a game where a bunch of guys are pursuing me so that i can either pick one of them or screw them over and watch them fight over me. All the guys in this game are either hard to pursue or jerks. This seems to be more of a life management game than a dating simulator. The best part of this game is that you can go to the library to read books and post on your blog about the books you read.			"

												When I started to notice that visual novels were showing up on Steam I hopped on board and dove right in, but it seems like this one missed the mark I was aiming for.First of all the story, which of course is the bread and butter of the genre, was lacking. Yes, you can help your amnesiac boyfriend regain his memories, and yes there are occassionally sweet moments, but the pacing is horridly off. You can visit your potential boyfriend every single day and only run into dialog between your character and him MAYBE once a week if you're lucky. What little dialog there is also doesn't help bridge the gap between starting to like someone and falling in love, which leads to an awkward jarring ending. Within a few hours you can hit the end of the game, which is disappointing, and it goes even quicker if you decide to skip dialog for a second playthrough.The gameplay itself isn't nearly as important as the story, but it's supposed to keep the game decently paced, but once again it fails. You end up grinding for stats almost everyday of the week, and other than plot items, money is nearly useless as regular activities are usually just as useful for stat growth, especially since you only need ONE stat at max to get the special endings. Because of the randomness of the stat-growth, moods, and money it can easily become a slow mess of saving and loading as you grind for your ideal outcome. It only slows the pacing and artificially lengthens the game, which is sad for such a short story.The audio gets old quick with an upbeat soundtrack that repeats far too often. It's especially obvious when going about your daily routine on the town map. It's a relatively small gripe, but it's worth mentioning.In conclusion, the game had romantic moments but ultimately lacked the dialog and pacing required to make a romance believeable. I wouldn't recommend this one.			"

												I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews - okay, sure, the gameplay is  linear (i.e ""go here 5 days a week and do this, then go here"" etc.) but the story itself is pretty interesting, and it's fun to get to know the characters! Each has their own personality and quirks, aswell as enjoying (or not!) different things, and each ending is amazing in its own way. Personally, for me, Hugh's ending(s) are the easiest to achieve, with Aaron's being the hardest, and Lawrence ended up being my favourite character! I love different aspects of each character and their respective ending. I guess games like this are ""each to their own"", but I'd definitely recommend it, just don't be foolish and under the influence that this is a ""dating sim"", as in, a dating sim where it results in sex scenes with the love interests, because it has absolutely no sex or erotica in it at all. Despite that, it's a fun game to play, light-hearted (for the most part) and it's worth getting! (Er, being brutally honest, not at full price. I got it for £6.99 during the Summer sale and I think that's about the most I'd pay for it anyway! So wait until it's on sale and grab it then!)			"

												This is the first time I've had to leave a negative review... I was looking for a sweet and fun VN, and loved the idea that this one included stats. However, they don't seem to have been implemented in a meaningful way. The first time through I raised them in a way that seemed balanced, but it didn't seem to make any difference - still a good ending with one of the guys, no reference to the stats. Next playthrough, I quite literally just did the same two actions over and over (update blog, chat with doctor) and just got a 'better' (?) romantic ending. The guys were pretty cookie cutter too, nothing stellar about either the plot or characters. It's too bad - I love games like this and really wanted to like this one, but it just didn't give me anything to go on. Pick up Magical Diary instead.			"

												Always Remember me is a dating sim in the style of a novel but with game elements that let you do what ever you want in youre free time. But will it be a game that you will want to read through ? In this game you play as Amy. She and her boyfriend Aaron get into an accident which leaves Aaron without his memory and its up to you to get it back. While trying to get his memory back you either can choose a diffrent boyfriend to go for or just go for the main goal. Overall how is this game ?I find this game a mixed bag let me explain why. Now for the better things: The game has great story and really good art. The gameplay is fun and its also really fun to do the diffrent activities. Now for the bad things: The game gets really boring after a while since every day you have to do the same thing and it gets quite repetitive. The game also has pretty dumb choice making and what would feel like youre moral choices to differ the story what it does to you it gives you a penalty for the wrong choice which feels dumb so essiantly theres only one choice and theres not going around it and plus the choices dont affect the story at all which feels stupid. Overall the game is a fun simple game and has 9 diffrent endings to be achieved which will prolong the two hour campaing. The game also gets repetetive after a while so be aware. I give Always Remember Me a 6.5/10			"

												An enjoyable visual novel. It's a pretty good romance story and the protagonist Amy actually has reasons to end up with one of the four guys you choose. That each has two endings, a ""normal"" one for maxing out the relationship, and a ""special"" one for also maxing out the stat associated with that character, is a nice bonus.If this game has one major flaw it is that the day-to-day life can get really repetitive. Once you know what to do you play out each day exactly the same, and there are too few random events to break up the otherwise monotone gameplay.Still, don't let that discourage you from giving this game a try. I enjoyed playing through it and will definitely revisit to get the other three character's endings soon.			"

The whole point of the game, is to fall in love with 1 of the 4 mans you can fall in love with or finish the game alone without a boyfriend.The idea of the game always displeased me, it's really not my kind of game. I found the story nice and the graphics were really well done... But it ends there. The music and the main characters voice gets so annoying after a while! I heard my main character say ""Awesome!"" or ""Yay!"" about 1000 times while unlocking the 8 endings and I am not kidding!All you do is eat, sleep, talk to the guy you want to end up with everyday, train up your stats (by clicking a button) and rinse/repeat. Really reminds me of Stick RPG, just WAY more grindy! Also there's a few spelling mistakes in the game and it's pretty short (It took me 5 hours to get the 8 endings...) So about 30 minutes to 1 hour for each playthrough...I don't recommend this game whatsoever, especially with the $18 USD price tag!			"

												Meh. MEH.This game was literally meh, in every sense, in art, story and love interests. Or, well, the town map was impressive looking.It's a fully working dating sim, but that's really all there is to it. The plot is really weak and unimpressive, sometimes even cringe-worthy to the point that I'm suffering secondhand embarrassment. It feels greatly unbalanced and repetitive. Wake up. Raise your stats. Go and earn some brownie points with the boyz. Go back to bed. Repeat the routine till you eventually get a small plot scene without CG.Endings are usually the essential part of a dating sim, it's the goal of the game. You usually have these expectations of them, for them to feel like the wrap up the game and give you closure. This game didn't just didn't manage to achieve that. It felt tedious (even the special ending), and it did not make me want to replay the game to unlock another ending.Overall, if you don't have too high expectations and/or you've never played at dating sim/Otome game before, you might enjoy it. There is a lot of room for improvement in this game, but honestly even if it was improved there is few things that could make a cliche plot like this interesting.Other than that, this game shows off a lot of different functions that it's engine is capable of. Which is quite interesting (and good I guess?).			"

												At first, I thought i'd give this a try because I heard a lot of mixed reviews. Artwork is pretty, but i don't think think this game is particular enjoyable aside from that. There isn't enough dialogue and any worthwhile plot which is a shame since this can go so far. There is no voices throughout the story aside from her going ""whoohoo!"" ""pretend you didn't see that"" if that is something you care for(i do admittingly). It involves stat grinding, which i'm decently used to. However it is random if you succeed or fail any tasks you choose to ever do, so it causes you so you have to save and reload farrr more than i'd like to than normal. The only rewarding thing about stat boosting is if you hit 100 relationship and 99 of a specific stat for the character you can end the game early if you 'wanted' to. Don't bother with this game if you want an enjoyable plot/value for your effort.  If somehow i'm still not able to convince you, Do NOT buy this at full price-you're gonna waste your money. However as a poster mentioned here which i agree to, is that i don't have a regret getting this game. There needs to be some encouragement for otome games to be supplied for the west.So to summarize:Pros:Pretty artwork!'Allows' you to end early so you don't have to wait longProvides an otome game for the small market here in the westCons:Simple characters/no enjoyable dialogue with the charactersRelentless relentless saving/troublesome to load/save			"

												I give it a 7 out of 10 for this game.The conversation between and the expressions of the characters covers up the lack of CGs.The choices you make in this visual novel are similar to choices you make in real life.The point farming system forces the readers to go through it in order to see the conversations.You are also mostly restricted by the amount of energy in the game.The graphics are quite good.The music goes well with the game graphics and the game itself.Unlike other visual novels I played, this one has its own uniqueness.

												A cute love story. The events are too spaced out, and they just end with you picking the correct of the two possible choices that you are given. It's way too repetitive. I've played through all the endings, and I found no hidden gems there. There aren't enough events to fully flesh out the characters. Your descisions don't have a meaningful impact and the story is streched out by manditory stat grinding.Also, food and drink are unnecessary if you always get a good night's sleep; who knew?			"

												Hope this will help other gamers and visual novel enthusiasts :) have fun! ^.^Always remember me is not a pure vn as it contains some ""gameplay"". This gameplay is basically Amy's (main char's) day to day life, she does what you choose to do. While this does sound nice and all, i personally didn't like it at one point because of the excesive repetitiveness so yeah  be aware of that, for those who like reading visual novels i wouldn't recomend this because of the little dialogue and grindy gameplay; other than that it's not a bad game:)Cons:- for a visual novel i felt that the dialogue is really scarce;- gameplay can get repetitive really fast;- too 100% i think you need to grind on 1-2 things daily( thus the repetitiveness);- you have to hunt for the dialogue or you might miss it;Pros:- has gameplay;- an ok story;- despite little dialogue it is nicely written;- easy (but long and boring) to 100%;- nice music and cute Amy voice:));'- nice graphics; "

												**Note: this is a copypasta of my review from DESURA**So if you're looking for a simple Visual Novel, this is your ticket.If you are not the sort who prefers clicking things in the same predictable pattern for 30mins or so, hoping to get enough RNG mojo to get the (usually 1-2min) ending you would prefer just to see them, it may definitely not be your ticket, even if you agreed to the first.The art is quite well done.Music is limited in quantity, but actually pretty decently done.The story and characters are somewhat interesting, though stereotypical, and also sadly fall flat in terms of the sheer limited number scenes/length of scenes available that aren't the click-spam that composes the rest of the game.The click-spam between story bits is what you do to try to gain relationship with the various men, and then there's special endings unlocked if you also get one of the 4 ""stats"" associated with them to max. Only thing is, you ""succeed"" only sometimes. Sometimes you don't. The ""difficulty"" seems only to affect how often the fails occur, which doesn't necessarily mean much either, since you can buy items using the ingame money you earn from your part-time job to improve your chances anyway. Well, we hope they do, since any actual ability to understand those %s are locked somewhere in the game engine.Don't get me wrong, it's a pretty game. And if you're looking to burn some time with just something simple, it may be worth a couple bucks just to relax with. Though please don't expect something amazing out of it. :)			"

												Such a sweet story with much potential, but no gameplay between the intro and the ending. No character or relationship development at all or anyone talking to you at all. You just meet people in the beginning, and then you can choose which relationshipbar to fill, and there are only the same actions to fill them with. No random encounters or people interacting with you. If you choose not to go for an ending, you won't even know that character is really in the game. I would rather just watch the different endings on youtube because it's all you really get :/ the stuff between is timewaste. Surprised at the price of the game since it's hardly a game. No dating or relations to enjoy at all. Just a grind to get to fill a bar to get to the endings which is a videosequence with no interaction. And no conversations to enjoy except in the very beginning with a few choices.An Addition: They should have chosen another title. Always Remember Me is an extremely sad title if you get any other good ending than with her original boyfriend and makes you feel really crappy about it all.			"

												The story is what made me interested in this game, where a young woman is having to cope with her boyfriend suffering amnesia and forgetting about her. I enjoy the stories and couplings that Winter Wolves make for their visual novels.However, unlike most of the others (like Heileen, Bionic Heart), this one doesn't depend on the choices you make, but rather how  much you decide to grind for a certain skill or activity. Such as if you want to build up your friendship with Aaron (the boyfriend), you need to read books to him. But instead of getting a scene each for the time you read them, you get the same repetetive two-liner whether he liked the book or whether he was too tired to listen. The same goes for the other possible romances in the game, you get a repetitive two-liner if things went good or bad.There are a few meaningful scenes in the game. When you reach a certain point on the relationship level (like 30), you get a special scene with the boy your character fancies. These scenes, if they had been more regular and not depended on your choice of grind, would have made the game excellent. These scenes are very touching, and some very important, to move the story along. For me, the lack of these meaningful scenes gave me no incentive, aside from achievement, to persue romance with anyone but the boyfriend. There's not enough character development with the others to make me interested in persuing romance with them. So even if this game is longer and offer more choices than Heileen, I still prefer Heileen for the fact that it was decision based throughout and there it felt more rewarding to persue romance with anyone.

												My amount time played on Steam played is about 20 minutes becasue I used my old saves to unlock the achievements. I bought the game from WInter Wolves a couple years ago during one of the sales, and I have no idea how long it took me to finish the game.You play as a girl named, Amy ( sorry guys there is no male option), and there are 4 guys to romance (no girls are avaliable to romance) and each guy has a normal ending and a special ending. It is a stat raising game, so if you don't like stat raising then you may not enjoy this game. I don't care for stat raising games, but I like visual novels and Winter Wolves games in general. This is not my favorite WInter Wolves game (I own almost all of them; some on PC, some on my Ipad), but it is worth a try if you like visual novels. Also if you don't like this game, you may like Loren the Amazon Princess a bit better becasue it has RPG elements instead of stat raising.			"

As you can see theres really nothing to the gameplayIf it was up to me I would put the change the price to somewhere of $10 its not worth $17.99.My final verdict is a 7/10			"

												I play a lot of visual novels, not so much the ones aimed at a female audience, but usually visual novels come with a good story which I enjoy, and this story seemed to be really interesting what with the amnesia thing. The story had so much potential but sadly it turned out that it doesn't really deliver. There's too much focus on stat building and you have to use a walkthrough next to the game if you even want to get somewhere route wise which completely takes away from the immersion and makes it more of a chore. The game wasn't completely terrible, I still managed to unlock some endings after all, but I can't recommend it, at least not at the full price, it's way too expensive. I do love the soundtrack of this game a lot though.			"

												Always Remember Me is a fun game. It does get a little boring, but it's a very touching story. It does lack some gameplay mechanics, but it's just worth it. It captures the exact essence of bonding. The plot of the story is that your boyfriend was involved in an accident, and he lost all of his memories of you. You make your way from there. You can try to get your boyfriend back, you can date other guys. It's a nice game, I just don't think it offers a lot of dialogue. Just a lot of gimmicky bars and statuses. I recommend it if you're paitent, I do not recommend it in general.  Due to the fact that is just gets really boring after a while!			"

												I will admit I went into this game with a mostly closed mind, but the story caught my attention and held onto it. It held on to it for a full five minutes before it turned into a cliche story line about how a boy loses his memory, and the girlfriend tries to get the boy to remember her. All while an overly cliche ex battles for the boy's heart again by taking advantage of his amnesia. I swear the developers said, ""Hey why don't we add an overly cliched rich, disapproving father for the boy that looks down and disapproves of the girl's attempt to revive his memory?""

												The idea of the game was nice like in any dating sim game, but failed to work, it lasts only ~2h (not sure if good or bad thing), the story is boring and you really don't get that much off from the characters.  Art is nice and suprisingly some of the songs playing at the background were nice. Ah well, maybe I'll give it another go sometimes.			"

												I only finished two routes before losing interest in the game. Overall, its just repetitive and there isn't much of a reward to show when you're finished with everything.Story-wise, the story is underwhelming. The main plot with the protagonist's boyfriend getting amnesia is a bit cliche, and there's even an ex-girlfriend that tries to steal him away. The characters are pretty stereotypical as well, and there isn't any real depth to any of them. Not to mention afters raising enough stats or going through all the days alloted in the game, the story just kind of ends. There are ""secret"" endings with each character as well, that you can get by maxing out the stat associated with whatever guy you're trying to get, but I always seem to prefer the normal ending, and the CGs for the ""secret"" endings aren't much different from the normal ones either. The art can be underwhelming at times as well. While the sprites look fine, the CGs aren't very consistant with the rest of the artwork. Speaking of CGs though, the event CGs aren't very memorable either. In fact, I can only remember the CGs from the end of each route I took, which mainly just consisted of the characters looking and smiling at each other. If you're an experieced otome player, I'd skip this. However, if this were to be your first otome, maybe you'd enjoy it, but I still can't really recomment this to anyone.			"

												Pros 4 possible boys to romance with each romance option comes with a regular and special ending lots of variety when it comes to clicking things Pretty good artwork Steam achievements, trading cards, backgrounds and emojisMixed The romance options aren't like the cliche ones you would find in a typical otome That being said, it doesn't mean the romance options are properly developed Random minor characters that don't do anything to the story Can't rename protagonist Subpar soundtrack??? No voice actingCons Storyline is subpar at most ♥♥♥♥ing hard as♥♥♥♥♥♥to get special endings when the chances of the Discipline/Romance/Creativity/Culture leveling up  is slim The price is way too much for a game like this, even when it's on sale DLC is a waste of money because it does nothing Most of the time, it's just clicking around and you have to just know where to go to unlock special events to get your stats upCharacter ImpressionsAmy: The protagonist. Cries a lot, but seems to be strong-willed. She works part time in an ice cream shop and loves to write.Aaron: Amy's actual bf who suffers from amnesia after she and him end up in a motorcycle accident.  Amy suffers next to no injuries and Aaron gets hospitalized for severe trauma. Seems like a stereotypical bf in the beginning, but he can't remember anything about him and Amy. Lawrence: Amy's coworker at the ice cream shop. He's the type to worry over everything and doesn't know what to do in emotional situations. Unreasonably passive but cares a lot for Amy.Hugh: A random guy who's friends with Amy (and maybe Lawrence too?) and owns a shop in the mall. He cares a lot for Amy, but in a different sense than Lawrence. Kind of a womanizer type of character.Eddy: Aaron's doctor in the hospital. He's a workaholic and lacks the ability to cook or do any sort of house chore because of his busy schedule. A deadpan mostly, but he keeps a close eye on Amy.Final Impressions:This game is worth around $5-$7 at most due to the lack of a storyline and a cast of underdeveloped characters. It had a good premise, but the way the story plays out just doesn't work well with the interactive quality of the game. I wouldn't invest the $20+ in the game because you really only get a few hours of playtime to complete the whole story with all routes and achievements obtained. If this game ever goes on sale for around $5, then buy it then so you don't regret spending over $20 for it. It has it's fun points and it was kind of enjoyable, but it's not as good as other otomes on Steam, but it wouldn't be so terrible if more work was put into it. 5/10 at most.			"

I also found it to be boring and repetitve, at least give the guys more dialoge! There was litterally nothing to look forward to except one or two encounters from each guy, other than that, talking to them seems rather pointless because there IS no conversation.			"

												This game has good artwork and music. What really got me was the storyline. For whatever reason, I felt incredibly guilty. The characters ""boyfriend"" protects her from a possibly deadly crash. Forward a day later and WHOOPS he lost his memory. From this unfortunate mishap, you have unlocked the ability to flirt with 3 other guys (shy co-worker guy, sarcastic shop-owner guy, and the doctor who is just-so happens is taking care of your unfortunate lover) or you can stick with you amnesia stricken boyfriend. 100% your choice!   My recommendations? Play it. Play it for the experience. Play it for the guilt. Play it for the icecream. Just play it.  My final result~forever alone! I think the guilt got to me....			"

												Always remember me is a visual novel based in the life of Amarantha an ice cream shop clerk , amy for shorts and his boyfriend aaron.The story is about aaron's father hating you ever since the relationship started because they're wealthy men, and one day a tragic accident left aaron in the hospital recovering from amnesia.You goal is to try to help him remember you and hopefully he will love you again while his ex girlfriend abigail tries to get him back, or you can start anew and seek a romance with lawrence your shy and smart coworker, Eddy young professional doctor, or Hugh a fashion designer.Every now and then you'll get events based on which romance path you're chasing and your choice can get you a lot of affection points or make your conquest harder.Game turns quite repetetive quite fast, after all you have to do the same routine over and over for 3 months in game time, and the relationship bar fills up too slowly even with the events.There's a total of 9 different endings, 2 for each possible romance and 1 if you end up alone.18$ for a visual novel is asking too much but if you're into this kind of game might want to wait for a steam sale.

												This game has a stat-based progression system to get through the story and woo a boyfriend, but it just boils down to clicking the optimal activities every day to get the stats you are looking for.

Just to have this B*tch come in and try to take him from me. In the end, I went down a path of my own of writing but then I became more depressed as the game tells me about how everyone else is super successful and happy and I'm an unsuccessful writer that still lives at home with my aunt.
