												I knew I shouldn't've, but gave this game the benefit of the doubt because Theme Hospital was one of my favourite games of all time and thought this could do alright. It's basically a mobile game adapted to PC - definitely not worth the $3, which sounds a bit harsh, but... there's just no gameplay. Sure, there's a tiny bit of management re: building rooms and elevating mood, but with all the clicking patients to make them happy, etc. it screams mobile. The music is repetitive, the levels are fairly boring. You can't draw your own room boundaries, it's nowhere near complex and yeah. Just not for me.If you like not being challenged, buy it. If you're looking for something like Theme Hospital, turn around and keep walkin'.			"

												This is not Theme Hospital - not even close. For a sim it is very fast and you never really feel close to your hospital. When it feels like you got it finally running, the mission ends and you start a new one - disappointing.... And each hospital is very small, the places to build rooms predefined, so you can never be creative - you just build each room once, like you should and the biggest impact one the game you have by research and training your team. Also the qualification of the staff when you get them is very different, so you also need a lot of luck - something you dont want in a simulation game.So it never fits in the shoes of Theme Hospital - but at least the diseases are funny like in the original - but that not enough. My suggestion: Wait for a steam sale and buy it for 5 Euro/Dollar - but dont pay more.			"

												I give this 2/5 stars. Reasons: Two stars for being a fun game, but the gameplay will only last about 4 hours if not less. You complete missions and can earn up to 3 stars on each. (Not very challenging at all). There isn't that many missions to do. I was hoping you'd be able to create your own hospital and see how long you can go with random challenges happening here and there (survivor mode if you would). There unfortunately isn't thus making this game dissapointing. Probably good for kids though. Cheap cost, and you get what you pay for.PS- There's a much older game extremely identical to this one (most likely the predecessor to this) that you are able to do ""survivor mode"". Theme Hospital<<< get that game instead if you can find it.			"

												It's difficult to give the game a thumbs up or down because it all depends upon what you are looking for in this sort of game I think. If I could give it a neutral rating, I would. But because I expect more out of my Steam games (than mere mobile ports and because seemingly, there is little to no developer attention given to this game any more, I have to give it a negative review).  Don't let that dissuade from the game if you just want a quick little casual game to pass the time with however.The game intends to be a silly, casual, pc port of the not so well received mobile version (the mobile version is riddled with negative ratings due to stability, bug, and lack of developer attention on issues). https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cccp.manager.java&hl=enOn with the nitty gritty....PROSDecent graphicsQuirky dialog and diseasesFun to focus the attention where you like via your research room (Lab)While you don't have room dimension control, you do have complete control over the hallways/lobby areasNo bugs or stability issues that ruined the mobile version, however there is at least 1 instance of incomplete text (text_placeholder) in a description of an item.No Microtransactions (like there are in the mobile game)CONSIt's a direct mobile port. While microtransactions were taken out, not much else was done to make it more of a pc game (but then, most mobile ports don't make that sort of effort anyway).  One of the issues that turned me off was that you have to click ""bubbles"" to receive money (from machines) and fix the moods of some patients.  It's obviously intended for finger tapping, but you use your mouse/pointer instead.It's not optimzed for PC. In the later levels when you have A LOT of patients swarming your hospital, it can decrease your FPS quite a bit. I can play high end graphic games all day without issue yet with this little ""app"" my fps decreases to the point that trying to accurately hit those bubbles can be quite frustrating.There is a pause feature, regular speed, and fast speed. Because so much can quickly happen on the map at once, it would be nice to have a ""slow speed."" Without it, it can be pretty hectic and I hate having to pause just to catch up.You can decide what type of room goes into which room slot, but your room slots on each map are already decided for you. This means no customization in as far as room size or actual placement, you are limited to the map's layout itself.It's important to understand that this is not a business sim. It isn't intended to be one. It would be like saying that the mobile app Airport Controller (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.logisoft.aircontrol&hl=en) is intended to be an air traffic controler simulator. No...Hospital Manager is an arcade game with the backdrop of a hospital.  It's all ""finger placement"" and ""finger tap"" but with a mouse for the PC version.This might be more fun on a tablet, but then you'd probably be buying the seemingly abandoned mobile version of the game.CONCLUSIONIf you want a casual, arcade game with a hospital as the backdrop, and don't mind the low fps at times when things get hectic, go for it. If you are expecting something more sophisticated like an actual simulator or even something with more options/features/customization such as Theme Hospital, then you probably will be disappointed and should stay away.

Teal DeerDevelopers: CCCPPublishers: MicroidsInitial release: Feb 2014Genre: Simulation, Humor #Worth/NotWorth: #NotWorthAtAllExposition, Concurrence and SummationHospital Manager is an even more satirical Hospital management simulator than the highly sought after nostalgic Theme Hospital from Peter Molyneux and Bullfrog Studios.This game sets you up in a pre built hospital in which you decide which pre built rooms will be what. From diagnosis, treatment and restroom facilities. The reason the game is satirical is you are not treating any sort of typical 'real life' ailments. You sort out Zombies, possessions and some sort of affliction in which people moonwalk whilst wearing an unconvincing Michael Jackson get up. Among many other sorts of silly ailments.  The treatments of these ailments is equally silly. If someone walks in holding their amputated leg, send them to “surgery” which is actually just a huge sewing machine. Are you a zombie? Well hypnosis is the answer (that one actually kind of makes sense if you use the colloquialism definition of Zombie in where someone is predisposed with something relatively unimportant. However the sprite is most certainly a traditional zombie.)All of that on its face its actually an interesting premise. I don't NEED a serious hospital simulator. I just want a good one. You'll need to manage patient moods, doctors training and maintenance workers as well as clowns. However the clown is more of a middle man between doctor and patient rather than a new age Patch Adams. Here are the main reasons why this game is not good- You cannot build the hospital. They are all pre built and because some issues arise in which multiple types of diseases show up you need multiple types of treatment rooms however there are not enough rooms to satisfy the demand. So you must now manage changing over rooms do deal with new things. Instead of making an actual functioning hospital.- There is no sandbox. The only mode is mission challenges.- It gets needlessly hectic. Constant pop ups telling you things you are already working on or things you can do nothing about until you have more money. - Staff management, research, and doctor training happens too often. You have to research diseases in order to increase the percentage your doctors will be able to diagnosis the disease properly. I had to research the zombie disease upwards of seven times in one mission just to get it at a reasonable diagnosis level to the other diseases in the hospital at the time. - The art repeats, there are only two doctor skins. This is a minor complaint. But as the game gets so hectic so quickly it makes it much more difficult to remember who is who and what everyones level is, so that in some vain hope of trying to keep the order I attempted keep all my doctors on the same skill level. So that I don't know.. I could make a successful hospital. THE GISTIt isn't a bad game but its far from good.  The satire nature of it I'm okay with. However in the actual gameplay of the game, the 'character' it tries to maintain with sewing machine surgery tables, hypnotizing zombies and attempting séances for the downtrodden and possessed it all falls flat.Follow my curation for more "

												I wish i could give this a great review, i liked the game, when it worked.  But it crashes a lot, now i can't even load my current saved game without it crashing every single time.  It reminds me so much of Theme Hospital, only not as feature rich and more simplified. I'm not even sure why a debug like window needs to be opened in the background while playing the game, the debug window when the game crashes doens't even really provide any relevant information to help diagnose the crash.

												I think they should have put some more detail in this game. They should have done it more like Theme Hospital, in which you build your own rooms and put objects in it. There are a few minor bugs.. the most annoying one is that you can place an object right in front of a door and the patient would still come in. Having said this... the game is still fun to play and it does look ONLY A BIT like Theme Hospital so I would definitely recommend this game for those who like this kind of style.			"

You cant unlock and buy the majority of the items as you only get a very limited time frame for each level, so whats the point? Very disappointed.2/10			"

												I wanted to play this because it looked like old Playstation game I loved (Theme Hospital) and I can not say that I would be dissapointed. Game gave me hospital managment with some whacky diseases and treatments. Lots to do and plenty humour.  There was not much to do with customisation as floor plans were ready and on each level you had to start from fresh again, so that was bit annoying. I would have liked to design own hospital and keep it but this was clearly game suited better for mobile gaming. All clicking for patients to be happy was hektic with mouse. This was fun game but nothing that you would want to out lot of time in because missions are over too fast. I would give neutral if I could.			"

It reminds me of Rollercoaster Tycoon (3) type of calibre, in contrast with the type of money-hungry simulators we have today!I love the depth of management the game allows, the various factors you have to maintain (reputation, patient health) and 3D cartoon style will feel at home for simulator players. The AI is good and allows for a unique play-through every game.Recommended!			"

												Very much the spiritual successor to the older ""Theme Hospital"" game from PlayStation. Hospital Manager is easy to get into as the first four missions are tutorial and explains all the basics you need to get going. It is a light bit of fun and some of the medical conditions are interesting. The first actual mission that you will get a 1-3 star rating out of is Mission 5 'Cursed Hospital'. All missions can be passed on first attempt if you are careful though you may not get a good star rating until your refine some techniques. The only mission that gave me significant issue attaining a 3 star rating was mission 11 'Fairy Tale'. This mission disallows you to have a negative bank balance which makes investment in treatment rooms more strategic especially with reguard to end of month payments maintaining a positive balance. I had to play it several times to make the end goal of 30,000 credit prior to April 1st. Other missions of note (ones that I will drop you a hint of two about how to pass). Mission 12 has zombies which vomit everywhere but it doesnt matter if the hospital is unclean. Mission 15 'Quarenteen' has an odd wing off to the left, that is the one you want to contain the parasites as you treat and research the condition. Mission 16 'Sacred Elephant' I recommend you pause at the very beginning and rearrange the existing hospital assets to configurations more suited to expediant care delivery. Mission 17 'Rural Threat' in the last month the Exo condition pops up which takes time and money to treat and a 3500 investment in a treatment room. Mission 18 'Energy 9000' (AKA Brawndo) very easy just deal with speed delivery. Mission 19 'Seasonal Virus' The parasites are back so section off part of the hospital to prevent the infected from mingling. Best of luck!			"

												Not recommended. If what you're looking for is a new Theme Hospital, you will be sorely disappointed. This game is an insane hospital time management. I find it unbalanced, not actually funny, and too hectic. You don't have enough time to actually do or see anything, except click on patients that grow unhappy and staff that fall asleep. There are no reports, no room customization, and most times you have hardly enough rooms to satisfy the hospital needs. The treatments are generalized, and sometimes don't make sense at all. It seems that the game has taken many elements from Theme Hospital, without really understanding what made Theme Hospital so unique and successful. Truly a pity, I had high hopes for it.			"

												Hospital Manager is a nice little game, but it has a few faults. There's no time set between really fast, fast and paused. I would have liked to see a slidy time control thingy. Also it feels a little hysterical with pop-up notifications every few seconds. Lastly, I felt it lacked any logical way of keeping the patients happy. I had to surround them with pretty things and vending machines, so much so that they could hardly move, and they were still unhappy, no matter how fast they were being seen by the doctors. All in all, if the game would slow down and let the player take control, it would probably gain the legendary status of Theme Hospital somewhat. Good effort, thoough. Hopefully the developers will keep working on this. For what it's worth, I managed to spend a whole 3 hours with this			"

												Great fun fast paced game!  Not sure what all the negative reviews are for, the game is simple.  The tutorial explains everything well, and the in game promts let you know what is happening very well.  I am only a few hours into playing this and can't wait to see what else this game will bring! Highly recommend!			"

												Really a pathetic game. It's barebone and you cannot add any other rooms than what you have during a mission...this said...there are only missions and there is no sandbox mode so not much of a tycoon-ish game.This game is a clicker game that you click the bubbles over your patients heads and it makes them happy/ you get money/ ect.I am sure some people would like this game but for myself it wasn't worth the 5$ i spent on it.

												This is an extremely limited theme hospital like game. Rooms can only be built in predetermined spots, can only have 1 of each type of room, can't hire multiple doctors to run a room while one is on break and no sandbox mode. Not worth buying.			"

												I thought it was pretty fun when I first bought it. Got to the superhero level and it keeps crashing. I take comfort in the fact it was only like $6.00, I've spent more in drinks in Manhattan. If you're okwith not being able to save progress and unclear how tos in a hospital diner dash type game go for it.If not keep looking for another game.			"

												There really needs to be a ""Eh"" or a ""No Decision"" instead of Yes or No for recommendation. If ever there was a flat middle of the road game, this is it. It's cheap to buy, and fans of Theme Hospital, like myself, might get a small amount of nostalgia. But, it's definately not on the same quality level as Theme Hospital. So far, all the missions are VERY short, you have no layout input, research system is very basic, training system is even more basic. Really the difficult part of the game (which is mostly easy) is getting through the rushes. Yeah, I know that's no difference than Theme Hospital, but So far, I've only had at most 3 diseases to deal with at any one time. I picked yes only because the price is so cheap ($3 currently, $6 when not on sale).			"

												The game is poorly optimised and during later levels almost comes to a complete stop when it tries to move NPCs. The game needs some cleaning, and also some open game design would drastically help. Its a much more restricted (albiet pretty) version of Hospital Tycoon.			"

Tracy Morgan get's in an argument with Sean William Scott. Sean William Scott keeps anoying Tracy Morgan till the point where Tracy Morgan just goes ""No no no no no no no no.... NO.. no...

YouTube™ Video: Hospital Manager - Launch Day First Look 

			Views: 1,440		

			Here is the link to buy this game on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/348290 Here is the link to Origin's ""Theme Hospital"":...		

Reminds me a lot of ""Theme Hospital"", an older hospital management sim game developed by Bullfrog Productions, but this one sadly doesn't allow you to draw your walls youself.  You simply start each level with empty square rooms all the same size already placed, and you choose what room goes into what empty room.This one also consists of much shorter ""levels"" that get progressively more involved it seems, where as Theme Hospital just let you keep building on the same hospital and expanding it out over time (from what i remember of it)The object of this game is to make money, keep the reputation of the hospital up by satisfying patients quickly, keeping it clean, and providing them services like benches, soda machines, restrooms, etc.You'll hire doctors and spend money learning and advancing your hospitals skills through research.  You can also hire janitors and clowns to keep waiting patients entertained.  There are some rather silly and ridiculous costs however, such as a clown costing you more then double that of a hiring a good general practice physician. All-in-all, after my first 20 minutes, it seems like it's a game that's worth it's price tag, especially at it's current 50% sale.  However it's not likely a game most people will play for more then an hour or two.			"

												I have really enjoyed playing this game. I feel that many of the people that have put bad reviews on here want it to be theme hospital or better. The game is simple, gripping and had good game play. It has been a long time since i have lost track of time due to playing a game but with this one i have. PROSthe game runs smootly with no bugs or crashesVery good gameplay and graphics for a £4 gameInteresting rooms and illnessesVery much like Theme Hospital and just as goodCONSWould like a free play level. on most of the levels you only get 3 months to complete the level, its not much time to really dig in and do all the research and buy the items.I would highly reccommend this game.

Note: there is a Null Object error some of us are having problems with (it has happened numerous times to me). I uninstalled the game, then reinstalled it and so far I have had no more issues.We have played Theme Hospital for many years and I've been on the lookout for something similar.  As far as I'm concerned, Hospital Manager does a good job at this.  The biggest differences are that you do not get to make your own rooms or change the size of them, you can't put move staff around, and you can't always tell why the patients are unhappy.  Yes, it would be great if we could do that, but it certainly is not a game breaker for me.  There are still plenty of things to do each level.This is NOT Theme Hospital. There will never be another Theme Hospital exactly like the old one. But if you like this type of game, Hospital Manager gets you a little closer.  As a bonus, even when it's not on sale, it's unlikely to hurt your bank account.  :)			"

												*Note: I only played the tutorial levels and the first three missions and my experience of this game is therefore limited.What is Hospital Manager?Hospital Manager is about running your own hospital. The game is divided in a number of levels where you build rooms and hire staff to treat the patients that come to you with their ailments. You cure the patients by first diagnosing and subsequently treating them. Both actions reward you with money to improve the hospital and reputation.You can improve the hospital by upgrading the staff, (re)decorating the hallways to keep the waiting patients happy or by spending money on research.A certain amount of reputation is needed to complete the level. You gain reputation by diagnosing and curing patients and lose reputation when patients walk out on you.Why I do not recommend this gameLet me start of by writing about what I like first. I do like the way the game does not take itself seriously, opting for a comical take on the hospital simulator. This ranges from the over the top injuries the patients have to the proposed treatments and the vibrant colours used, as wel as the notion that no matter how bad the injury may be, enough benches, flower pots and clowns on site will keep the patients happy. I personally like this kind of humour.This, however, leaves a lot to dislike for me. For starters, The layout of the hospital is predetermined and you cannot choose the size and content of the rooms you build and can only build in predetermined spots, severely limiting player creativity. After the room has been built you need to pick a staff member. They have three attributes (speed of treatment, profit per patient and number of patients helped before the doctor needs a break), but some staff are twice or even three times as good as others, whilst costing less in wages.During gameplay you get frequent (and I mean frequent) popups with tips or pointers, but they take up a rather large portion of the screen and hinder gameplay when you are zoomed in. There is no way of disabling the popups.Also worth mentioning is that this is a mobile port and it clearly shows. Aside from the removal of the microtransactions the game is identical to the mobile version. This means that all the busywork in the form of tapping is still in place, therefore each level forces the player to constantly click on vending machines, staff and patients.I would also like to draw your attention to the inaccuracies written down in the ""Key Features"" on the Store Page. For instance, this game has no 'comprehensive management' in any way, shape or form. Just build rooms, hire staff, decorate the halls and keep the research going, whilst doing your busywork and closing the popups. And their claim that this is a 'nonlinear adventure' just boils down to cause and effect: If you choose to, let's say, hire a clown in January he starts working in January. If you however hire the clown a month later he starts working in February. Seriously? This is worth mentioning as a Key Feature?ConclusionAll in all, this game is not good. It is a mobile port with shallow gameplay, almost no management whatsoever and severely limiting player creativity, with a nonsensical Store Page to boot. Not recommended.			"

												I bought this game because I loved Theme Hospital back in the day and was looking for a modern version of the game and quite frankly this is not it. This is just a wanabe oversimplifed copy of it. So if you're looking to buy it for the same reason I was then I suggest you instal the HD textures for Theme hospital instead and keep playing it because its much better then this game.			"

												It would be cool if there was a nutral button for reviews. This game has some pros and cons. ProsIt was fun to play and had some strategy to it. Some levels were more frusating then others but sometimes its nice to have a challenge. If you get stuck there are also several tutorials on youtube and other various sitesCons      There wasn't much of a story line, it seemed random. There was a little at the begining of each mission but when I got to the end of the game it just ended. I was a bit surprised it was over so quickly. There was also a glitch where after playing for a while the game had an error and would shut down. Annoying when you were in the middle of a hard mission but they have a auto save function so not all was lost. That being said I'm kind of nuteral but if I had to pick a side I'd choose yes. Because the game was fun and a nice distraction. I just wish there was more content or a endless mode with like a high score chart. "

												Good game to kill time when you're bored like me, not worth $5 though. Thankfully I got this game for $1 so I didn't lose much. There are lots of cons to this game. This game is like an app gone wrong where its too much for something so simple.- There isn't really any new scenes or rooms. All it is, is a change of the room lay out, so after a while it starts to get old pretty quick.-Very short games, the levels aren't super long nor are they difficult to do- I love games like these because I can upgrade it as much as I can and it becomes  a challenege, this game however doesn't really bring a challenge, and there is very little you can change or decorate.- The 'decorations' are super simple and theres only like 6 items max on each category.- The game will keep telling you patients need food, drinks etc. even though I already have those items in the hospital and once I buy more items they 'need' it doesn't even get used.-There is not much you can do with this game honestly, it repeates way too much and some of these patients are the most corny I've ever seen.The worse part is, this game after only 3 hours has been crashing CONSTANTLY, so then you have to start all over.TL;DR, unless you are looking for something stupid to waste sometime on because you're bored etc. i guess this will do. If you're looking for a game thats exciting and gets you moving a lot while you are also in control of how things work/look, this ISN'T the game for you, prepare for crashes too.			"
