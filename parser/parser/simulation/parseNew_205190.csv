												I used to play Guitar Hero with friends, got pretty decent at it, until I realised it was stupid spending that much time learning to play a piece of plastic. Soon after i got bored of it and stopped playing while thinking ""it's sad you can't do the same but with an actual guitar so you'll learn to play it"".So when I found out about Rocksmith, it sounded pretty much like what I had always hoped for a rythm game and I had to give it a shot, bought a boxed game version with the original cable (30€ on Ebay) and a (very crappy) 50€ second hand guitar from a brand even google never even heard of. Thing is, I'm freaking poor and couldn't afford spending 200€ on a decent guitar just to ""give a shot"" at Rocksmith and risk wasting it all if disapointed.So what do i think after a few weeks of trying? Well in short: HELL YEAH! If you're hesitating just go for it, you won't be disapointed. After years of unsuccessfull attempts to learn bass guitar, i can tell for sure i made a LOT more progress in only one week of Rocksmith than in 5 years of solo learning, and that's in both Bass and guitar (since a friend brought his bass to my place to play with me).I would'nt say for sure that Rocksmith will make you a guitarist/bassist, I think you'd still have to get a teacher at some point if that's really what you want, but if you want to learn the basics, improve your skills and check out how guitar work for you, Rocksmith will give you full satisfaction. You just skip the annoying, long, repetitive hard work part to go straight to ""now I enjoy practicing"" part. I only wish I had something better than that crappy guitar as it's becoming an obtacle to my progress, I'm currently trying to save up for that.My only advice: If you're buying a guitar for this game, don't go too cheap, you'll have nothing decent under about 200€ and it'll ruin a lot of the experience.Pros:-Excellent concept-Very entertaining-Very well done overall-Absolutely suitable to learn-Handle either guitar/ emulated bass (on guitar) / actual bass guitar-Allow 2 players to play together-Impressive real time adaptation to your skills and progress-Tyranics Mini-games to force you progress faster on a specific techniqueCons:-Menu is a little hard to navigate at first-The cable have some misses, I have to unplug/replug it every now and then, not dramatic but could be improved.-I miss a function to alternate players quickly, instead of changing profile after every songs.-We can't skip the noobish tutorial when creating a new profil, why would you do that? Just... why? Some player know how to press a string, they don't need an unskippable 15min lesson on it.-The songs database is a little short and not very diversed (pretty much only classic rock), and the songs to buy in the shop are quite f***ing expensive, 3€ each, not allowing poor players like me to enjoy many songs they really like.Conclusion:Very good game, such learning, much buy, wow.

												*UPDATE: Got a Real Tone Cable now. Much better. Preparing Rocksmith 2014 review too*As I was looking ways to learn guitar because I bought a Les Paul recently made me look into Rocksmith, a blend of a learning software and a game that in a sort of way reminds of a Rockband or Guitar Hero but complex and versatile at the time.I plugged my guitar as I started the game, and it said to me after reaching the main screen I needed a Real Tone Cable as it specified in the store page. It wasn't a problem, as you CAN USE OTHER SOFTWARE to emulate the Real Tone effect so the game can recognise your guitar and then, let you play the game. You have to search the software in the internet and it makes you play outside Steam (that's why I have 5 min played, but I have played several hours) and if you want to be inside Steam while playing, you have to add the shortcut to your Library. Without the Real Tone Cable there is NO WAY to play inside Steam.I still recommend buying the Real Tone Cable if you have the money to, because the other software can sometimes crash in a middle of a song or event and that ruins the experience of it. If you get the latest patch of the software, it will crash once in a while.Talking about the music, the game offers a big catalog of songs (including a lot of genres like metal,classic rock, rock, alternative,etc) that grow smaller as you learn them all (but that will take quite a while though!) and a really extense one of DLC that is, in my opinion, somewhat better than the original because you buy the songs depending on your taste of music. I often buy my DLC during a sale since each song cost 1.49$ then and you can buy a lot more.The gameplay is fantastic. The different modes that a song has include Practice,Perform,Riff Repeater and Techniques Used (and the great Master Mode unlocked after 100.000 points achieved in a song) The most valuable for me was the Riff Repeater, as you have 3 other options inside of it called Free Speed, Leveler and Accelerator (You can also manipulate the speed and level of the section) Those 3 help you to practice different sections of a song without trouble letting you do a first test to know your current level of playing the section, and then giving you 30 attempt to play the section at perfection. Losing lives after lives make you really try to play the section correctly!At the end, play Rocksmith and you will have a great time as you learn the instrument you love with tons of hours of gameplay. Highly recommended for pros or starters.			"

												Rocksmith 2014 Remastered9.99 / 10.0 Rocksmith  Rocksmith 2014 Remastered Learning to play Guitar or Bass is a lot of Fun with this game; heck, just playing along with your favorite song is a blast. You play Guitar or Bass? then this game is for you. There is nothing like this software out there.... Unique.I purchased both Rocksmith (original) and Rocksmith 2014 (auto upgraded to Remastered version) and I am telling you to buy both. Buying both gives you access to more songs. Any song purchased in the older Rocksmith(original) version is automatically installed in the 2014 Remastered version. Rocksmith Original: 51 songs (6 unlockable, 169 DLC)Rocksmith 2014: 55 songs (10 unlockable, 800+ DLC and growing)Customforge 2016: always adding custom DLC (CDLC) == FREEMany basic skills are covered in this game; although nothing beats a real teacher for instruction on tone, clarity, smoothness, and savoir faire; THIS GAME WILL GIVE YOU MINUTE BY MINUTE the most pleasure per dollar spent; your teacher cannot match this. It is literally as fun as jamming on weekends with your band. Pure fun. Pure entertainment. Pure value. Get it.NotaBene1) when you purchase the Rocksmith(original game) add the ‘disc import tool’ to import the original songs. DLC is automatically transferred to the 2014 Remastered version whether or not you purchase the disc import tool.2) Fun includes discovering songs and styles that you do not listen to on the radio or in your car.... Play every song that you can and learn; I discovered Bob Dylan for the first time on my Bass Guitar [Bob won the Nobel !]3) Don’t like the Steam/PC choices of songs? Just download all the custom DLC that is on the .net [free].... Heck, why don’t you make custom DLC of your favorite song and upload it so that everybody can learn the song that you love?!My scoring system / 1010 / exemplary execution of the genre with compelling innovation9 / exemplary execution of the genre don’t miss out, for fans of the genre and the curious alike8 / for well done not a must play, fans of the genre and newbs will be happy it is well done 7 / for calibrated expectations only, fans of the genre would not miss out if they skipped this6 / only for serious fans of the genre for whom game play with bugs is acceptable5 / enough bugs to make me unhappy			"

He is being a negative Nancy and is♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on your dreams and holding you back from headlining Glastonbury. In the words of 2Pac ""F the haters"" as thats what he is....Yes this game is great, from never picking up a guitar before playing this game I like the learning curve to it and the soundtrack (plus the dlc) is quite varied enough to keep you coming back to play.

												I've tried to play the guitar on and off since I was a teenager with varios methods including DVDs, books and partwork magazines but I've never really kept playing as I get impatient that I don't sound good right away. Rocksmith solves that issue by rather than starting you off playing little riffs, you go straight into full songs and it plays most of the notes for you. As you start to improve, you get asked to play more and more of the song, leading into you playing the full song yourself so from step one, it sounds musical and for someone like me, that was the incentive that I needed to play more. I'm only a week in and already I feel like I can call myself a guitar player wheras the last 15 years I've really been ""a bloke who owns a guitar"" Granted, I'm a BAD guitar player, but with the variety of songs and mini games keeping me motivated to play, then I genuinely feel I will become a decent one for the first time in my life.

												I'll be honest: this game won't do much good for absolute beginners. While it has various learning videos and explanations, it is more of a game meade for practicing guitar, not learning it from ground up.If you won't expect that this game will teach you how to play, you'll be satisfied. It's good at what it does: practice. Many guitararcades minigames to practice one technique or another. Technique challenges to master your skills even more. And the best part: the songs. Playing guitar parts of your favourite songs with quality accomponement just feels awesome.P.S. You don't need Ubisoft real tone cable to play the game. Just your guitar and no-cable fix (google it up)			"

												I recomend it purely because of it's arcade style pogression. It's missing from the 2014 version. The new 2014 version dosen't feel like a game at all. It feels like a practice program. This original game feels like a game should. Praise and objectives are much more fun to recieve than the new version. If you want to learn guitar , but are more into video games I think this would work better for you than 2014.			"

												Whether your a seasoned guitarist/bass player or never picked up a guitar/bass guitar on your life. Rocksmith is for you. It can genuinly teach you how to play either instrument. When I first got the game I had been playing Bass guitar for 3-4 years (self taught, I've never had lessons), and was great just to play along to the songs as well as teaching me more advanced techniques like tremolo picking and slap bass. Since then I picked up a guitar and within a couple of weeks of playing guitar on rocksmith I'm confident enough to call myself a guitarist. As for graphics in this game, its plain and simple but its forgivable since your playing an instrument and not looking at the scenery. However there are a few annoying bugs in the game which can stress you f*** out and make you rage, but they are usually few and are between.8/10Recomended for anyone that can play or wants to play Guitar/Bass guitar.

												This is a wonderful Game. It has something for everyone that likes to or wants to play Guitar. I have read many reviews and it seems like the thing people complain about most is what I call instant Gratifcation. This Game is a FUN way to learn or even just a Fun way to practice. But you still must practice, Playing Guitar or any other insturment for that matter will take practice. There is no such game or course that will have you playing as good as the guy in your favorite band in a matter of only a few hours. It does not exist. No Matter how you learn you gotta practice. The best part about Rocksmith is that it takes that chore of practice and makes it something fun to do. I'm a 58 year old Rocker that decided to start playing again and using Rocksmith I am having a great time and learning a ton of stuff at the same time.			"

												Almost a year of guitar traditional practice and I still didn't feel like I was getting anywhere. Watched reviews of RS on youtube and various other sites and got interested. Bought it, got the cord, started playing and love it. The game is engaging and makes you feel like you are both learning to play and have so much more to learn. Even when I'm frustrated with a few lines, can't quite hit the notes/chords, not fast enough to swith, the game is still fun. I assume in an effort to be nice, the game offered to let me lower the quality needed to play an event, but when I refused, I was able to play more and beat the trouble area of the song. Pro's: Very engaging, learning and remembering parts of songs, challenging but varies to meet my skill by song and by area of the song. Huge amount of fun, want to play more often than I really can.Con's: Song selection - Not bad at all, but wish I could get more of the music I love in the game. Would love a tool that allowed users to add music to the game. Instructions are ok for useage of the playing features but not very good for tones and pedals/amps from what I've seen. As a beginer, I'd love more info on what effects are available and when to use them as well as info onpedals and amp styles. Overall, I love the game and recommend it for anyone wanting to learn to play.			"

												I would highly recommend this even if you own and have played 2014.  The DLC content alone makes it worth the money but it also has some features that 2014 does not like a few arcade games.  The way it manages venues gives it a much different feel than 2014.  I wish I would have purchased it long ago.			"

												Here's how the game mostly works.  The game requires a special cable that allows you to plug your guitar into your computer.  So just downloading the game won't allow you to play it unless you have that special interface cable.  Once you plug in and tweak your options, the basic campaign will give you the simple ""Rocksmith"" experience.  When you first start, all of the songs are not yet ""leveled up,"" so you only need to play just a few notes of the melody, and probably no chords at all.  But as you play each song again and again, the game figures out which sections of the song you're getting good at, and increases the difficulty, add more of the melody's original notes.  This goes on continually, for every song you play, making the game increasingly more challenging the more you play it.  After you have played each song and ""leveled them up"" to maximum, you'll basically be playing the song as it was recorded.As a ""guitar instruction"" method, I really think this has potential.  The early part of the game is simple enough that really ANYONE could play it, and the more you play, the more the game challenges you as a guitar player.  Each song as a few different arrangements, some focusing on lead, some on rhythm and chords.  The game is a harsh judge, so make sure you hit EVERY note, not just the ones that are easy to play!As some who already plays guitar, I found the game was most rewarding when I was selecting individual songs to play from the game's catalogue, without bothering with the campaign at all.  I sort of knew how to play Outshined already, but learning how to REALLY play it without cheating was a treat.  I pick a song I like, and practice all the parts of it individually until I can play them all, then I try to put them all together by playing the complete song on the maximum level.  Sometimes I can pull it off, depends on the song.So if you're already a guitar player, or you are really interested in learning to play, this game is definitely for you!  Tons of new songs to play as downloadable content.  But if you're a ""gamer"" who's not really much of a musician, even if you really liked Guitar Hero, I'd say this game is probably not your cup of tea.  It's more of a ""musician's thing"" than a game.The game also features support for basses, and an entire campaign just for bass players.  FINALLY, some respect!			"

												This game is amazing for both beginning and advanced guitar players. When I first bought this, I already knew all of my chords, including bar chords and power chords, and could play various songs on my own, yet about two days in, I could already feel a challenge, and even failed a few venues. Now, at 60+ hours, along side my own playing, I can definetly say it has honed my skills, and even brought many weeks of enjoyment and new music to me. I reccomend this to all guitar players out there looking for something new and exciting. Get out there guys!			"

												This won't take you from zero to hero. You might be able to learn to play some simple songs but there are some important tips you should pick up first from an instructor or elsewhere. A good free website to start would be Justin Guitar. With that said this would go great with anyone learning to play guitar. I don't feel its as much a teacher but more a practice tool. You need the usb/instrument cable also so you might need to buy this in stores.			"

												Rocksmith is excellent for anyone interested in playing the guitar or bass. It won't teach you everything you need to know, but used along with the wealth of instructional resources available on the internet you can go from never having touched an instrument to playing and having fun quite quickly. Practice is boring and frustrating, especially when you're starting out and unable to play anything. Rocksmith gives you a shortcut to actually playing songs and having fun, and it makes you desire to practice and get better.			"

												Wow, I've been taking lessons for a while now, and practicing my scales and chords etc. I can bust out a chord melody real good, sounds great, but didn't realize how much trouble I had picking individual strings and frets.Well, engaged by Rocksmith, playing the guitarcade game Ducks alone forced me to move up and dow the fet board where I've never been before, just amazing how liberating it can be.My skills and techniques have improved tenfold and i think I only have alittle over an hour? Must give bleeding fingers and aching arms a rest, but this is much more than a game! from plucking just a single note at a time as a beginner to choosing the single note or chord arrangement for a song as you advance, this is great for all skill levels!!HINT: Turn audio quality down to 16 bit CD Quality and you shouldn't have any delay problems using the Rocksmith Chord.

												After 129 hours on Rocksmith 2014, I got the original so I could tap into the older set lists and DLC's.However, I am much more impressed with the way the original motivates me to play songs I would probably not have otherwise played. It has missions where to practice for and play Venues. Each venue has a set list of 3 to 6 songs. You have to practice to qualify to play the venue.The new version does not have these types of missions. Due to the way this is set up, I played through every song available, including the DLC's I chose within about 18 hours and really kickstarted my playing ability. I've really noticed how much I've improved as I go through them again. I also believe the songs in the original are a little easier to play as they seem to be less complex that the songs included in the 2014 package.Overall, i like both versons. It would be nice if they had the same kinds of Venue missions in the 2014 version though.I'd give it five stars... the RealTone Cable could really use an upgrade though. I'd give that a 1 star. Even with how careful I've been with it, it makes a lot of pops, crackles and overall static if it's not in just the right position. For that, the Cable is really lame. This game ROCKS though.I'd also add that the Guitarcade is also better in the original game as well.			"

												I love this game and I recommend it strongly for beginners. It's better for beginners than the 2014 edition since it gives you a gig that you need to train for (something that I really miss in the later one) and that motivates you more than just ""Get a 50 note streak in this song"". I would not recommend it as a ""learning tool"" for more advanced players (2014 is better for that if you're advanced enouth), but it's still a really fun game with good songs. If you have two cables, a friend and you want to jam something new but you're not certain what, then you're going to enjoy the co op.

The original RS slants in favor of a career mode by having the player play events while RS 2014 seems to possess a deeper focus on teaching the player how to play guitar.  Both succeed and both games are a blast given their slightly different perspectives.  If you're hell bent on learning to play guitar as I am, then RS is a nice place to start.			"

												edit: if you are drunk and can rev up judas priest on rocksmith you'll love this FOREVERseriouslyfirst of this isn't really a game game.but it did something nice for me: took away my fear of tabs that by looking at them made me go ""i'll never get that"".mostly you'll suck if you are a beginner and choose your favorite song. but learn continiously.buy rocksmith just for the cable. got it for 40€ considering the cable costs about 30€ it was the best option.(and now i'll wait till rs2014 is on sale hehe)edit: i got the 2014 in sale and it's as amazing as i thought!seriously if you plan to start playing the guitar and love rock get these games ( rs and rs14)			"

												I have played guitar for many years and got this as a way to keep my chops up while not currently playing in a band. The verdict: it works! I recorded the same guitar part before and after about a dozen hours of playing the game's career mode and there was clearly an improvement in both my timing and phrasing--also the number of tries it took me to get a decent take when from like fifteen to one or two. I maybe would have seen the same result practicing along w/ a metronome but this seemed like more fun.The one major caveat for experienced players--esp. ones like myself who have never played anything like Guitar Hero--is that this is entirely unlike how most people typically learn to play songs. Normally, you learn part A, B, C and D or whatever and then the solos if you want and piece them together. This just throws sort of a fake book simplified version of the entire song at you all at once. As  you get better, it starts to fill in the notes until you are playing the actual guitar part. It's strange and sometimes frustrating but if you keep plugging away you will get through and eventually you learn to read the game's kinda 3D, color-coded tablature quite well and the process becomes quicker. My other complaints would be it can be a bit too lenient on timing and sometimes it lets you fudge chords. If you let the game's scoring dictate how you play, that can lead to bad habits. You need to show discipline on your own and play the parts correctly even if you can cheat a little and get a better score. Also, even using a relatively high end pro-sumer type soundcard (Focusrite Scarlett), there is a slight delay to the audio which you get used to but is enough to be annoying. It reminds me of playing on a digital guitar amp circa-2000, more of a feel thing but that matters. Overall though, this is a fun way to practice and I've found myself playing guitar more both with and without the game. I am just letting the game pick what songs to learn and am finding even the songs I don't like are actually fun to play. Also, like most people, practicing on my own, I tend to just practice the things I am good at and letting the game pick songs forces me out of my comfort zone. Definitely check this out if you are looking to improve your existing guitar skills.			"

I have never played a guitar and I say - the game introduced me to my guitar and after a week I play ""Can't get satisfaction"" riff pretty good for a guitar-moron...Now it is time for  Rocksmith 2014 to show its limits!!!

												Rocksmith's certainly an interesting beast. It is a Guitar Hero esque game you play with a real guitar, with the express intent of being a teaching aid to teach you how to play one. I picked it up for that express reason.Let me be blunt for a second, playing an actual guitar is a fairly hard thing to do, so it does take a lot of perserverance to try and play this game for long stretches. It has a nice song selection and more available via DLC. There's also multiplayer to see who can get more points, or if you want another player to be the bassist.Bare in mind that Rocksmith requires an additional cable that came bundled with the retail game, so if you have any old 1/4"" jack it won't cut it. You have to buy their specific cable, which usually comes with the game itself. So if you see Rocksmith on sale on the Steam store try and avoid it, unless you have the cable.			"

												Game is worth every and each cent.You start as a begginer and fight through many difficulty levels to reach that point in your guitar carier when you know that you can play anything with some practise.Additionally mini games included in a game will help you learn your instrument quick and in funniest way possible!One con is that you need special cable for your instrument which isn't really expensive.

Every track starts at a beginner stage making them become tedious, hitting single spaced out notes waiting for the 'AI' to pick up and them be fun to play.There's also the DLC songs which outweigh the base games by 3:1.Rocksmith 2014 removes my gripe and lets you choose a difficulty.

The arcade mini-games in Guitarcade and additions of the amp will let you become crack addicted to them and be unable to stop playing.No matter how good you are, you won't put down the guitar until your body demands it.That's for sure !

												As a person that play an instrument since when he was 8, I would like to give an opinion about this ""game"".Overall, the presentation is nice, it is clean and has no frills; the options available are plenty; altho what the software is missing is a sort of guidance. There is a ""suggested path"", which takes you trough various venues; kinda mimicking what Rockband does: get a certain score in these events and you move on to different ones; but there is not a real career mode; everything is left to the player's will.I am not guitarist; I play guitar regularly for fun ,but far from being a person that can take a sheet and read it and play; I can do that with a keyboard, but I am not able to do so with a guitar; so I considered myself a good user which is part of the large portion of the audience for this game: from beginners to mildly good with guitar.When I started, I was immediately startled by the lack of whatsoever training; from what I read, this game teach you how to play...well, it doesn't. It is not different from getting a chord book and some sheet paper and start to try to play songs...there is no real teaching behind this product, as they want to market it.As a piano student for more than 15 years (I had to stop, no time, no space no will to continue, but I still play sometimes the elec keyboard); I was expecting to start from the easy things: like a good teacher would do: teach you the various notes, start with some exercises to familiarize, and then play simple songs as rhythm or second guitar. Nothing of this is happening here...if you start to follow what the game suggest, you will start to play real songs, which if you don't know the song too well, means you just go around looking at the fret, looking at the screen, back and forth, missing most of it. IF you do well for few phrases, the game increase the difficulty, which means that throw at you some hard part to play, making you feel frustrated (after the joy of being able to finally play something), and the game scale down again to a simplier structure.What is missing here is the basics; you should learn how to pluck each string; once that you do it on one chord, the game should challenge you to pluck more strings, so you get the green, purple, orange colors, besides the initial red and yellow strings that seems to be used at easy level most of the time.Then the game should teach you how to move your hand to play clean notes with one finger; and once you are good at that, should teach you the various scale, so you can play notes without even move your hand from a specific position. Done that, the game should teach you chords, and how to transpose them on the fretboard, doing variations.I mean, that's boring stuff, and I am aware of that; but this gives you the skills and muscle memory to then learn what to play when you play a real song! I had to exercise on my own doing these things, before I was able to enjoy this program...if they market it as learning game; they may want to use it as real learning tool, and not simply force you to have to do a bunch of stuff for the sake of it, until you finally did it so many times, that your brain learned it.This is not how you learn; at least not as most people do. You learn with practice, but you need the basics first.I bring as example, Rockband and how it teach the drum: in that case it works because you have limited variations (you have just 6 pads plus the pedal), and in the beginning, the song are arranged in a very simple way, making you feel that you got it, before you move to the next difficulty level; while here I felt totally lost when I started to play few songs, right after buying the game. It may be me, but I really dislike this ""method"" used with this software: is not making me play the same song over  and over again that you teach me.If they were planning to teach each song, they would start with some exercises on the specific chords of each song; specific riff and such (which seems to be present in Rocksmith 2, I have that game too and it is leaps and bounds better than the first one); while here you have to go in the library, learn some chords; then go to the lessons and follow them, then back to some challenges to increase your flexibility and speed and then you go back to the song....all is left to the player, which is the best and worst feature of this software.Song-wise; I basically dislike 80% of them; ironically the best songs are the small ones that you play while performing the various skill challenges, written by the developers. Maybe is just my taste, but I see a lack of 80% of what made rock popular....they saved these songs for the DLC and the second game probably.OVerall; the game to me is a solid 6 out of 10; entertaining once you know the songs, and the various lessons and skill challenge are a good way to keep you entertained and trained; but for a total newbie that start today with a guitar, it feels more like a chore than a fun thing (unless he/she is totally determined to learn guitar and love and know most of the songs).The majority seems to like it, guess you can't make everyone happy. As suggestion, skip this and buy directly Rocksmith 2 (or wait for the 3rd, which hopefully resolve the last issues of this product).			"

												I'm still a bit hacked off that I HAD to buy original Rocksmith in order to accss older DLC content on Steam. That being said, after installing and playing the older Rocksmith and experiencing it's song selction I'm happy I did. I found a new in-box copy for PC on Ebay for just $12, so not so bad. I'm 52 and grew up on the likes of the Stones, Punk Rock, 80's, and even 90's tunage. Getting to play No Satisfaction by the Stones for my first song was a treat. The tutorials and videos for guitar newbs like myself are outstanding. In no time I will have the riff for Satisfaction down. I would highly recommend both Rocksmith versions for any beginner to moderately skilled guitar player. Great tool! After all these years my 4 guitars may actually see use instead of collecting dust! My goal is to use Rocksmith to improve enough to warrant the purchase of a Gibson Les Paul over my Epiphone I have now.			"

												Either my guitar's fret scaling and pickup is too bad as I'm using a beginner guitar or, it's just your sound cable for this game sucks! I'm no guitar master but it gets me very frustrated when playing high speed songs because it just CAN’T recognize some right notes I'm playing, and it’s not just certain notes! Now I did tried to adjust every volume level I could, and did tried to figure it out if it was just me not playing the notes clean enough as I've been playing acoustics for more than 5 years, trying hard to get rid of bad habits and adapt electric’s finger pressing & picking techniques. I’ve tried this software on 1st generation i5 (2009) and 4th generation i7 (2014) CPU both with GPU level above GTX 850m 4G, so it seems not the hardware problem. Well over all it’s a good game and design but, not enjoyable while playing high speed songs! "

												This game has some really great points, but some possible, yet inherent, downsides. I have played guitar for more than a decade, and despite my bias against the whole idea of a videogame as a learning tool, this manages to be a fun game and a decent learning tool. I would not reccomend it for somebody who has just bought a guitar and is just now learning simple because one could become entirely dependent—for learning—upon the mechanisms in the game instead of learning to read sheet music or tab. Anybody who has played for more than a month would most likely benefit from it assuming he/she had sufficient knowledge on basic chords and a elementary understanding of scales. The game will teach quite well, and will introduce a varied array of topics such as vibrato and harmonics with mini-lessons. Because of this, one must ensure that the styles and genres represented by the songs that come with the game are appealing and represent where he/she would like to be musically in the future. Even if the songs are unappealing, they serve to encompass a variety of technical skills; as long as one ensures that he/she is utilizing proper form, technique, and rythym, his/her use of the game should yield a well rounded guitar player. The songs are also fairly easy; learning from rock music is much easier than learning from a more demanding style, so use it as a launching pad to get started—even if rock isn't the first choice. Just don't expect the game to provide motivation—it's only going to roughly assess the player and provide the next step, which can be extremely difficult when one is teaching himself or herself.			"

												At first I imagined it to be a rocksmith simulator.  One where you melt down your own iron and cobalt ore into magical ingots of rock.  I really looked forward to forging my bass neck multiple times to give it that characteristic of near-invuneralbility like the mandalorians taught me back on Corellia.However this game is more of a tool to get you into the habit of actually picking up that instrument you have lying in closet gathering dust; more than once a week.

												Great game to learn the bass guitar or regular electric guitar. Nothing like guitar hero or any other guitar anything series. For noobs at the guitar and bass this is your life saver. This does work and it makes it fun to learn any song you pick up. Also you can jam down with your buddies in muiltplayer mode which is great! You can always go back and play through hard parts in slow mode till you really get the muscle memory & timings down.9/10 I give this game.Make sure you buy the cable seperate for this game to work!As someone who has played string instruments for almost 20 years, this game is great to keep up my finger speeds and scales. Not to mention drink some beers and taking some bong rips and just having a blast bringing back nostalgic memories from old songs I am jamming with.			"

												I'd always laughed at THOSE games. You know the ones. Guitar Hero, DJ Hero, Triangle Hero, Tamborine Hero, Kazoo Quest, etc etc. However a year ago I finally got up to date on the Donkey Kong rhythm platform game on the Gamecube. In this, you use bongos to control attacks, movement and jumping.. you really feel like a monkey, bashing away at those bongos.But anyway, that got me thinking how cool ACTUAL music is as a control/input/interface method for gaming. Then, I found out about this.Unlike those lame Flute Quest Hero games, in this, you don't have a plastic flute or french horn or scratch turntable, but rather the actual musical equivalent. For this game, it is focused so far on guitar and bass. I am using a 7 string guitar, in a different  tuning to the game. My guitar was set up for this drop F tuning, so I was worried at first it might not like my guitar.. well, it wasn't an issue. There are stickers provided in the box that allow you to set the numbers of your frets via stickers on your guitar, so for me that was perfect, moving the frets up 2 spaces and ignoring my 7th/lowest string, I can play the game fine. Harmonics are a little tricky tho, but can always tune up for those tracks/parts..In its essence, this is the best way to learn guitar. The best way for guitarists of any skill level to play along with other people's tunes, as well as for experienced guitarists to have a program with which to assess and further develop your existing skills. The DLCs are great, a little bit of metal is available - Pantera, Lamb Of God and some oldies like Megadeath.. some indie rock like Pixies, but mostly this is about rock, new and classic. There is a multiplayer aspect, but it's only local and you need to get two cables for it.. wondering if latency would increase due to extra guitar or bass input..Also if you want to practice bass on a guitar, it has an octave pedal to 'emulate' bass on guitar. It's a pity there is no online multiplayer, but there is leaderboard scoring.Not to mention there is an updated version RS2014 coming out in rOcktober, with support for different tunings (only found standard and drop D so far in the game). There's a lot that could come to this game and a lot that is already in there so it's hard to describe everything. I dream of one day there being mod support for this title, or plugin/addon support by community producers. At the moment however there is a large range of DLC tunes you can purchase for $3.50 USD (in my region) each.. not a bad price to own a song, but also to have the tablature and a program to help you learn it :)The latency is a bit of an issue at first, but once fiddling with the ini or game settings, you can get something reasonable.. seems to be somewhere around 30-200ms range depending on settings, but it can be worse if you don't follow the set up guides or have a cruddy PCI/PCI-E soundcard or a slow computer.There's a lot to recommend about this game - support it and throw away any other music games you have that involve plastic. Why learn how to play a peace of plastic when you can play the real thing..While it is harder to get into it, if you don't have an electric guitar or bass (obviously this is required for the game, but it doesn't mention it on the system requirements on the back, LOL!) it might be a bit of cost to buy one to play this.. but still, I think I would have learnt A LOT quicker when I started playing guitar 15 years ago, if I had've had this tool at my disposal then. The marketing is true - it IS the quickest and easiest way to learn guitar, I fully endorse that. However if you are not sure guitar is for you, also if you are younger or have softer hands/skin, it might be worth starting out on a cheap nylon string acoustic before moving to steel string electric..

You can learn songs at your own speed, and also play some fun arcade style games with your guitar.  The PC version is a solid.  If the menu issues were fixed it would be a 10.  *Of course be forewarned about needing the special USB cable.  I already had one because I bought this game for PS3 back when it first came out.			"

												Really helpful to learn how to play a lot of cool song from different styles and even discover some new ones.However don't expect it to truly teach you how to play guitar.If you're considering buying Rocksmith, I would advise you to buy the second version (2014 Edition) which has a lot of improvements concerning game modes and tab display. I've unfortunately noticed some problems during the tuning of my guitar: sometimes the game doesn't seem to get when I am playing on the e cord or is extremely sensible and you end up loosing some time only to tune a guitar that you might have already tuned before plugging it onto your computer. Still I don't know if these problems come from the game itself or from my copy/installation as I haven't looked for similar problems on the forum.Ultimately even if I recommand this game as it is a really good one, you should really consider buying the 2014 edition instead of this one.

												I've been playing guitar for many years so I was skeptical when I first heard about the game years ago. I wasn't planning on getting it, but my grandmother bought me the 360 version and I thought it was pretty great. There is a small latency from the time you play a note to the time it outputs the sound which was expected. The only bad thing that I noticed was when playing with a guitar that has a passive pickup, the game has a hard time recognizing some of the notes. This was fixed when I started using a guitar with active pickups though. Overall, I enjoyed playing along with some of my favorite rock/alternative bands. Whether you are an excellent guitar player or a beginner, this game is worth buying, especially when it is on sale.Pros:-Play the geetar on the MTV-Good selection of rock/alt bands-Levels increase/decrease depending on how well you playCons:-Slight sound latency-Sometimes misses notes you played			"

												Great for practicing guitar! The RockBand-ish note stream for tabs is well done (and cues any relevant techniques), as I like that it amps your guitar over the song playing. It makes learning songs much easier and more fun than when left to your own devices. It's getting me to practice more in general.The game can be used as an effects board / amp too, which is really neat. It gives you a pretty wide range of pedals to experiment with, as well as preset setups for each of the songs in the game.The song list is also really good, as are the DLC offerings.It's probably not great if you don't already know a little guitar though - it's a supplement to learning, not a full course.

Go ♥♥♥♥ yourself if you cant keep up with a song in real time.  Know how chords work in general and want to practice them?  Well you gotta sit through a 5 minute non interactive non skippable condescending video about how to form your first chord.  Playing this game to learn gitaur would be like reading a 500 page essay on the theory of PB&J sandwich construction and being tested on the authors biographical information before being allowed to make yourself a sandwich when you are hungry.Oh yeah, and on top of all that, the game will misread which fret you just plucked even when the lone note was all it had to process.  Great concept, tolerable buggyness considering you use your own gitaur, however, the condescendingly slow tutorial phases are genuinely intolerable to me.  And this doesnt affect gameply much, but game menu navigation in this game is worse than any game ive ever seen.  Sometimes the back button is escape key, sometimes its the space bar.  Sometimes space bar pauses and un puases a game, sometimes it takes you back to the main menu.  Controls suddenly and regularly change, and worse yet, they often change to perform the opposite function they had before.I want someone other than ubisoft to clone this game.  Id probabally play the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of this game if it wasnt more issue than game.			"

												I CANNOT reccommend this game with Rocksmith 2014 Edition having been out for over a year. (And possibly even if RS2014 never came out but I'll get into that). So if you're thinking which version to get buy and Rocksmith 2014 and stop reading right now, Pros: +You can import the tracklist to Rocksmith 2014 (for a fee but you should as it's a good list)!+There's a few minigames that are sort of fun to play and should have been ported to RS2014Cons:- Many, many load times.- It is unclear whether or not you're playing lead or rhythm guitar when you make selections.- Purple notes blend in with the note highway- Missing guitar techniques like vibrato - The ""career"" mode is boring - The note highway itself is very ugly and confusing at times.- No more DLC (this is a reason to get RS2014).- Lessons are very basic no where near as good as RS2014- Sometimes single notes are just recognized (I don't have this issue in RS2014).- The unlockables are pretty lame. - The tone designer is lacking.Now I paid $7.50 for this and with the Clapton/Cream song not included in RS2014 topped on with achivements, some new mini games and being able to see one of my favorite games (RS2014) roots it was well worth the $7.50 but I just cannot in ANYWAY reccommend this game over 2014, it excels at everything and makes this game look like complete trash (which isn't too far off). Wait for it to go on sale $30 is too much for a not so grea game...Lastly Buy Rocksmith 2014!!Edit: fixed a grammatical error			"

												I originally got this game to try to get back into playing the guitar... I remembered it recently and started playing.  I spent maybe 45 minutes in the game, at least 15 of these were unskippable ""tutorials"" that didn't actually contain ANYTHING relevant even for a beginner.  The UI is clunky and slow at best and I honestly uninstalled it just now.  I'd rather learn the old fashioned way from a book than ever deal with that UI again.  If I hadn't bought this so long ago and forgotten it I would be applying for a refund.  As it is, I had more enjoyment typing a review than playing the actual game.  if you have patience for bad UI and overall design this might be a good solution for you, but I personally refuse to lower my standards on what I'm willing to deal with and therefor this goes into the ""games I bought and played once then never touched again"" stack with the likes of divinity II and other garbage.I should note that I spent VERY little time actually playing this game so the review maybe not so much on gameplay, but the time spent with the menu made me absolutely hate this game before even going into playing it.

												The Real Tone cable is a hell of a thing to get ahold of. Don't just assume that your own line-in hardware will work, either. The cable acts as a physical DRM (silly since it's on Steam) and the game will not accept other inputs.That being said, there are workarounds. Sloppy, messy workarounds. After a crack here and a patch there, you MIGHT be able to get the digital signal that's already showing on your computer to run through this game, too. Maybe.			"

The lessons and techniques section is mostly useful for a quick exercise.The pay for songs is a bit silly and overpriced.

												This game is probably really great if you already have a good familiarity with guitar and are around the intermediate level of skill. With its automatic difficulty increases that you can't do anything about unless you restart the entire game and lack of documentation, itntroducing unexplained symbols etc, and if you are a total beginner looking for a learning tool, look elsewhere. get a lesson. This game was designed by people who knew how to play guitar. More likely they were really good at it in fact. I do not feel that there was a connection there with the devs and the total beginner. This is more like a practice tool for a decently skilled guitarist. Maybe the 2014 edition's better but I'm not paying for the same damn game twice if the first one was a dissapointment.			"

												Fiddle Around with a ""Rocksmith™ Real Tone Cable"" SimulatorFeatures Include:-Recieiving♥♥♥♥♥♥support from Ubisoft-Not getting the cable to work on any combination of cables/guitars (I have 2 cables and 3 guitars)Seriously, I found out the issue. You need to have enough power coming from the usb port. If you don't have enough, you should buy a powered usb hub and it'll work. Ubisoft never mentioned this though and it led to people being confused about why their cables weren't working...It also adds a hidden fee to the game...Even with this fix and a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of tweaking, there's enough audio delay to make the game unplayable for me and I have a fairly decent rig.After screwing with the total MaxOutputBufferSize and the LatencyBuffer (the tweaking that I mentioned), the delay persists and seems to only be an issue with higher notes for some reason.It works fine for some people, but for me, the tiny bit of delay completely throws me off.Then again, I've spent hours getting rid of ANY delay on MIDI Controllers in the past, so maybe I'm just too nitpicky about this sort of thing.In the end, it's not for me and let's throw in an unnecessary ♥♥♥♥ Ubisoft for good measure.

												If you have some spare cash lying around and are aware of the extra cable needed (or the software workaround), sure, not a bad way to learn. I have been playing guitar for years and got over the ""work your way up"" approach to the difficulty levels in songs fairly quickly.. I knew how to play half of the base songs anyway, but i became totally addicted to the speed run exercises and learning different scales. I also brushed up on my bass skills which was fun. There's a lot on offer to guitarists of all different skill levels. Is it worth the money? Not really. But it was fun while it lasted.			"

												Do you want to learn how to use a guitar, in a fun, exciting, and innovative way? (This is just plain lazy, you'd have more fun with guitar tabs and Guitar Pro - check it out, no Rocksmith cable, graphics card required.)Guitarists would probably find this game cute for a while, but wouldn't find it very entertaining for long.Honestly there are so many resources available online these days for people wanting to learn guitar.Justinguitar.com - helps those who want to learn the basics of various styles of guitars without any money involved.This is pure gimic - it has trouble recognizing certain notes properly. While the menus and interface seem to be make for people who know little to nothing about computers or calibrating hardware, interestingly enough, many fixes you need to make to fix the guitar delay and graphics are relatively technical. Fixes sometimes require going into *.ini files to manually adjust settings and numbers, going through IRQ priorities and other issues. Chances are if you have any problem, you'll be talking to the numerous people on troubleshooting forums, rather than the clueless Support Staff. At the end of the day, nothing beats a real life 1-to-1+ guitar teacher (At this point in development - Skill, motivation to play, your sense of accomplishment - are still not gained from playing this video game)			"

												Overall, the game works well, if you can get its graphic settings low enough to get it to behave.  Prepare to shell out more money on a top-of-the-line graphics card, as even a decent graphics card won't do it.  Just because you can play Team Fortress 2 doesn't mean you can play Rocksmith.  And the lowest settings you can set it to absolutely REFUSES to let us ""lesser"" graphics card holders in.  It would be better if you could download a mod that allows you to set your graphics setting really low, but apparently everyone with electric guitars and basses have the latest Alien Wares.Buy the console version, it tends to work better.

												Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014 do NOT output any sound through USB headphones.Most friends I have use USB headphones as they allow the option of surround sound. To not deal with this issue is a huge oversight for a music game.If you use USB headphones or speakers, buy a pair of turtle beaches or something with the money you'd be spending on the games, otherwise you likely won't be able to enjoy it.

												If you have an electric guitar laying around and wouldn't mind learning how to play, this is a great way to start. I've been teaching myself for about five years now and purchased Rocksmith on the grounds of learning some songs I have a hard time finding tabs for online. Though I wanted to jump to the hardest difficulty to get a 100% accurate tab instead of every other note in a song, the game insists on taking it easy and adding difficulty as you play along and presumably get better. I'm a bit stubborn so I was a little unsure about this at first- but this is how improvements are made. You PRACTICE. So as I played, I noticed songs gradually start adding more notes as opposed to the simple starting fragments. This system works great. There's also tons of little games to sharpen certain skills. The best feature in my book, strangely enough, became the settings for all the amps. As the owner of an amp with just-alright sound settings, having a ton of new sounds and effects to work with was awesome. I have actually found myself: plugging the guitar into my computer to fire up the game, selecting an in-game amp setting, then plugging my headphone jack into the aux. on my amp, and using Rocksmith as my new amp at the volume of my real amp. Rocksmith is a valuable asset for someone who already plays guitar as well as those interested in giving it a go. Give it a try! "

												The best learning tool I have seen for guitar or bass! It can simplify every song down to where you are only playing 1 out of every 4 notes or you can play the song note for note, all on a real guitar. Top it off with the ability to choose between just rhythm, just lead, or a combination of the two really allows the player to focus on the aspects of guitar playing they need help in the most. Two player coop, support for vocals, and mini games to help with fretting(among other skills) pushes Rocksmith from a simple learning tool to the only tool you will ever need. While the DLC may be expensive compared to Guitar Hero/Rock Band, a lot more work is put into each song than on the less realistic counter-parts.			"

												Actually plugging in a real guitar and learning to play real songs? What more could you ask for? Any beginning guitarist and even seasoned players can enjoy this. Cable that you have to buy seperately is a bit expensive but worth it imo. The DLC's with additional songs are a touch overpriced so I have only added a few extras when on sale. Overall this ""game"" is highly recommended and I heard the new one 2014 blows this away and any DLC's you purchased for this version will transfer over to new one which is a big plus in my book.

												Finally, a game comes along that has the potential to actually turn you into a rockstar. Well, maybe not literally, but Rocksmith can help you really learn songs. No more mashing colored buttons rhythmically on cheap toy controllers, because Rocksmith lets you use REAL GUITARS and BASSES to play along and learn songs. It reads the output of your instrument, so it knows if your playing the right notes or not at the right timing (provided you adjusted your latency properly).This is incredible for noobs -- beginners just starting out who want to learn a few popular songs, because Rocksmith is less of a game and more of a gamified teaching tool. It tracks your progress, adapting to your apparent skill level mid song, so you'll see a few note fly on the screen at first, but if you play more notes, Rocksmith doesn't punish you, but instead decides to display more and more notes until the ""real"" guitar/bassline is finally revealed. Essentially, the game rewards you for being a better musician, the way it should be.There are plenty of modes that teach techniques like string bending, double stops, hammer ons/pull offs, muting -- mainly through tutorials and games. These techniques are also used in songs, so they become as practical as they are entertaining.Overall I'd have to say that Rocksmith is the best thing for beginners to learn songs beyond crappy online tabs, paying for lessons, books, ""hot licks"" DVDs or investing in software like Transcribe (which is excellent and I recommend to anybody remotely serious about learning music) to slow down tunes and learn piece by piece.

												Great guitar teeching game. It doesn't replace a proper teacher but you learn how to play a good amount of Rock songs in an enjoyable way. Perhaps some basic guitar experience is desirable to enjoy, but it's fantastic anyway. It made me play guitar again, after a 4 year pause, and that's an accomplishment.			"

												As a complete guitar beginner, I was given this game by someone upgrading to Rocksmith 2014. Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive. I've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge. It's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately. However, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs. Really something I would recommend to rock enthusiasts and wannabe musicians alike.			"

												Guitar Hero Who? Man, this game blows that out of the water. Want to really learn how to play guitar? This is the real deal. And for $10...what a steal! You still have to have a real guitar and pick and you have to get the USB cable to plug into your guitar...but man! what a great learning tool.I already knew some chords and songs, so picking this up didn't have a huge learning curve. But if you've never picked up a guitar before, this might be a bit of a challenge. But the payoff is, you will learn how to really play the songs in the game and real chords and progressions that you can use to train your fingers to play many other songs.The real beauty of this game though come in 2 forms. The first, is that it turns your computer into an amp. As you progress through the game, you earn amps, guitars, and effects pedals. Then, when you just want to practice outside of the journey or mini-games, you have multiple effects and amps to tweak your sound.The second, and most important, is that this game adjust the difficulty in REAL TIME! It is awesome. It senses, mid-song, if you are struggling, and then tones down the difficulty. And, if you are doing well, it slowly increases the difficulty while you are in the middle of playing. If it senses that it bumped up the difficulty too much, it takes it down a notch. Watching this happen mid-song makes what could be a frustrating experience into a very satisfying one. Some songs have easier riffs than others, and to be rewarded for your effort is awesome.Pick this game up and then go look at the library for some DLC. I have added 2 songs to my list of songs from the DLC, and it makes the game that more fun to be able to play along with songs I really enjoy.			"

												This is Guitar Hero with an actual guitar, or bass, if you so choose!I was definitely skeptical about this, as it seemed like a great idea, but I wasn't sure if Rocksmith could deliver exactly what it said it could in a quality program worth the high price. To my surprise, it did end up being worth every penny.The Rocksmith Real-tone cable (which must be purchased seperately) actually works amazingly well, and when you're not playing in career mode or just playing random songs, you can just go into ""Amp mode"" and jam out, which contains an insane amount of custimization for sounds and tones etc. and more can be unlocked and purchased.I really thought this was going to be a hard game, but it starts you off slow and depending on how well you do, difficulty is altered, allowing you to play more notes to a song until by the end, if you're doing well enough, you are playing the entire thing.The game walks you through every step, from the very beginning, and even though some parts here are slow for experienced players looking to jump right into the game, it's definitely going to be very useful for beginners. When you get to more difficult songs that require chords, tremolos, hammer-ons, you name it, there are tutorials and mini games based on playing those notes that will appear, teaching you how to perform them while having fun at the same time. Even when you do lose, you just want to keep going because every time you get a little better, and after mastering any of these, you truly feel like you have become a better player.There is an in-game guitar tuner which works better then any tuner I have ever even used in real life. Before every song, you hit each string, and it lets you know if you're in tune. If you're not, the tuner pops up, and tells you how to adjust. Although this may sound annoying, it usually only takes 3 seconds if nothing has to be tuned, and ends up being extremely useful, and practical, regarding tune-age upkeep.What you are learning here are REAL songs, that you can practice in the game, and then go play later.In only 24 hours I have learned over a dozen songs, and although I can't play them all flawlessly or in their entirety, some of them I've gotten pretty damn close, and eventually with practice, you can nail any song. You literally start to impress yourself with what you have learned in such a short time. I really didn't think it would ever even be possible to learn popular songs without teachers or tablature, it takes up too much time and is frustrating, so I have mostly only ever played by ear or wrote my own material in the few years that I've been playing, but this game solves those issues and proves me wrong.I even reccomend this to people who are still pretty new to guitar. It's fun, and actually makes you WANT to learn, because you see yourself progressively getting better. It's faster and much more simple then using tabs, the only thing is you only have so many songs to choose from.Sincerely impressed by the quality of this game/program/purchase.  They took a great idea, put it together, achieved, and then delivered if not the best possible outcome, pretty damn close to it.			"

												I read a few  reviews on how good this was, now let me make this clear, guitar playing for me is for my own amusemnt I DO NOT WANT TO BE A PRO OR BE IN A BAND! i would just like to play.Let me begin!I have ALWAYS wanted to play the guitar, tried at various stages of my life to learn, bought books followed tabs...hell i even bought a fake guitar that had lights on it to tell you where to put your fingers! and i was RUBBISH at all of them.Then...along came rockband, oh so near just not quite (can play easily on pro, expert on some, MANY hours on that!)After 6 hours now, i have learnt 3 chords and can almostpluck my way through a number of songs, thats 3 chords and lots of string positions more than 6 hours ago~!I will post when i hit 60 hours, but for now I can honestly say this is fantastic if you want to learn guitar or bass, for a total cost of £60 (software, cable, second hand guitar) you can do A LOT WORSE!

												Actually plugging in a real guitar and learning to play real songs? What more could you ask for? Any beginning guitarist and even seasoned players can enjoy this. Cable that you have to buy seperately is a bit expensive but worth it imo. The DLC's with additional songs are a touch overpriced so I have only added a few extras when on sale. Overall this ""game"" is highly recommended and I heard the new one 2014 blows this away and any DLC's you purchased for this version will transfer over to new one which is a big plus in my book.

												The best learning tool I have seen for guitar or bass! It can simplify every song down to where you are only playing 1 out of every 4 notes or you can play the song note for note, all on a real guitar. Top it off with the ability to choose between just rhythm, just lead, or a combination of the two really allows the player to focus on the aspects of guitar playing they need help in the most. Two player coop, support for vocals, and mini games to help with fretting(among other skills) pushes Rocksmith from a simple learning tool to the only tool you will ever need. While the DLC may be expensive compared to Guitar Hero/Rock Band, a lot more work is put into each song than on the less realistic counter-parts.			"

												This was a must-have game for anyone who has ever wanted to play the guitar; but it has been superceded by Rocksmith 2014.  This is only worth getting for the songs that you can import into RS2014, and there is the ADDITIONAL COST of getting the import-tool to do so on top of purchasing this game.It requires an official Rocksmith Realtone Cable (and an electric guitar / bass) to play.  Unofficial cables can be used in conjunction with a patch, but this can cause problems.Within 6 months of casual play I went from having absolutely no experience to mastering my first song; and I enjoyed pretty much every step along the way as the levelling system incrementally increased the difficulty to suit my level of ability.It made practising a pleasure, which is crucial to developing your skills – more so than learning the numerous techniques that game teaches you and helps you to master.The selection of songs is solid, and the vast amounts of DLC allow you to pick out some favourites to play.  This does, however, add to the cost a fair bit – and the fact that RS2014 charges to import the original game's songs to that version is pretty much charging you for the same content twice.  Thankfully that doesn't apply to the DLC songs.The game does, unofficially, support custom (community made) songs; although these are of varying quality.The game is an amazing technical achievement, and Ubisoft's usual nickel-and-diming doesn't detract from that.

												Even though I played guitar for a while before this game, I always had an issue with my technique and playing entire songs rather than riffs. After playing for my currently 93+ hours, I can proudly say that Rocksmith is a fun, and surprisingly engaging game (especially if you set up your own, optional training regimen like I did). A minor nitpick would be some of the non-gamebreaking interface troubles I had and how excessively arcade-y the minigames feel. Also, for anyone getting started, I STRONGLY recommend looking up some audio lag guides to smooth out the game.9/10 would space ostrich again			"

												What, you play guitar and if you don't suck you will end up playing the songs note for note. If you're ready to upgrade from simple rhythm games to something that will challenge you beyond the ability to push colored buttons in basic patterns, then Rocksmith is for you. If you find Guitar Hero or Rock Band too difficult, then skip this. If you think that those games amount to little more than a weirdly shaped and painfully simple MIDI drum kit and you own a guitar, then buy Rocksmith and prepare to actually enjoy yourself while learning some new songs!

												Get this if you want to learn how to play guitar. Great if you don't have anyone to play with in the real world. This will keep you motivated, teach you to play real songs and learn all the basic skills you need on your journey to being a rock and roll guitarist. Career mode is great and provides an interesting way to progress through the content but RS2014 is easier to read the the note highway in my opinion. Songs also seem more complex in RS2014 so you might find these songs easier for a beginner. Buy RS2014 if they are the same price at the time of purchase.			"

												Having played both this and RS2014, I'd recommend getting this first as a beginner. Sure, RS2014 offers new features, new songs and fixes some annoyances, but as a (intermediate) beginner I definitely experienced a smoother start in Rocksmith.The career mode makes you feel much more like you're progressing, the lack of said career mode (which can be cumbersome and frustrating) makes you feel like you're just plucking away at one song over and over, much like learning guitar by yourself using a book/DVD. As a side-note, career mode is not the only feature RS1 offers over RS2014.Thus, I'd recommend getting this game (maybe retail with the cable, likely cheaper than Steam overall, outside of sales) and then ""upgrading"" to Rocksmith 2014 once you've played through a good amount of the career mode, at least that's how I did it and I feel like it was a good transition. I might even rate RS(1) higher, overall.			"

												If I had to come up with a short phrase what this game is, I would say ""This is Guitar Hero with REAL guitars!"". Rocksmith is very good with teaching newcomers to guitar on how to actually play the guitar with it's very interactive User Interface, and it records how you are doing on each song you play. If you are doing good, it bumps you up a few notes, all the way until you reach 100% and you are playing note for note, chord per chord. It also has instructional videos on how to do certain techniques and then it has you doing that technique and it makes sure that you are doing the techniques properly.Not only is this good for newcomers or beginners, but it is also useful for experienced and/or intermediate players! Especially when you are really busy and you don't have the time to practice as much, this game really brings you the motivation to want to practice as much as you used to before your busy schedual.The Amp mode is very well thought out, and it very useful for people who want to create their own unique sound with different amps and pedals, without having to buy amps and a lot of different pedals.If you are into guitar and you want a good way to learn guitar without having to pay a lot of money a week for lessons or you are looking for a good fun way to practice different styles of music, then I would say this is the game for you; and before I forget, you can also play bass guitars as well, and you can use ANY electric guitar and electric bass guitar.9/10 - A great game.

Posted: August 6, 2015
												The following is my review in pseudo FAQ format. Enjoy! :)Why did I buy Rocksmith?I bought this as a way to learn to play an electric guitar - something that I (and I suspect many others) have wanted to do since childhood but never really had the right tuition or couldn't quite follow along with a book/video. Mainly because you can't necessarily trust an instructor to be able to tell if you're hitting the right notes/chords and a book/video may assume a skill level or familiarity that you, as the learner, just do not possess.Also, as per usual, it was in a sale and it's taken me at least a year to get around to buying a Real Tone cable once the price had come down in price to £20 on Amazon.Do you actually learn how to play a guitar?Yes. Yes you do.  You start with simple single note arrangements of songs, leading to complex single note arrangements and then on to a combination of single notes and chords before going to full chords.  The speed at which you do this depends on what Rocksmith thinks is best for you in terms of your actual ability, with arrangements being made simpler or harder (or truer to the actual song being played if you prefer).  You can also practice specific chords of a chosen song, any part of a song, different arrangements, or change songs in your ""setlist"" to ones you're more familiar with and/or genres you prefer.Starting with single notes, you are also memorising your guitar's fretboard and how far to move your fingers without even counting the frets as you go.  As you progress further, Rocksmith will introduce new elements such as sliding from one fret to another - both as part of the song you're playing and to further cement fret positions in your mind.  Even after a few days to the end of your first week of playing, you'll find yourself being able to play songs with far fewer mistakes (perhaps even perfectly, as of course everyone learns at different speeds).  Certainly, you would have started developing those all important calluses!Okay, I get that Rocksmith is a learning tool - but what's Rocksmith like as a game?As a game, Rocksmith is far more entertaining than say Guitar Hero/Rock Band in that you're genuinely playing along with a real guitar (that needn't cost the same as a Guitar Hero/Rock Band accessory), and is always just challenging enough in difficulty and the side games provide a welcome relief to learning songs and using a real guitar as an alternative controller whilst still being educational.  The Rocksmith Points that you get for completing songs and side games all add up to your resulting score and is a good objective metric of your progress/ability.Speaking of side games, these are unlocked as you progress so that you're never in a position where you are in way over your head.  For example, the first game unlocked is the Duck Shoot where you play single notes on the 6th string in particular fret positions to shoot the ducks, simple enough. But from there as you progress, you'll unlock the scales mini game and so on, providing an incentive to carry on and is yet another way of letting you know how far you've come from starting out.Additionally, there is a multiplayer mode and it's up to you and those you're playing with if you want to be competitive or use it to encourage as a group to all learn a skill.What's the song selection like?Like a higher priced budget collection in that all the songs are well known and like all budget collections, you'll be a fan of some more than others (perhaps by a great margin).  For example: if you want popular 50s rock artists like Chuck Berry and Bill Haley? You're out of luck. There aren't any TV/Film themes either (which are almost traditional to learn) or rock instrumentals such as FBI by The Shadows.If you like Nirvana, Snow Patrol, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and the like (generally popular rock from the late 80s onwards) then you'll be escstatic and perhaps disappointed your favourite song wasn't included, which is small beer when compared to those of us who prefer 1950s-1970s rock given that we get 8 songs (three of these being by The Rolling Stones - with none of them being Paint It Black! Have to upgrade to Rocksmith 2014 to get that one) out of a total 57 that come with the base game (6 are unlocked as you play, all of which are from 2011).  For the sake of completion, two of the songs from 1988 onwards are Run Back To Your Side by Eric Clapton (2010) and Jarvis Cocker (formerly of Pulp fame) represented with one of his solo efforts ""Angela"" (2009).  For Clapton and Pulp fans (of which I'm neither), this is something of a raw deal given the  respective back catalogues.Well what about the DLC are my/your tastes catered to there?Yes and no. If you live in the US? You'll be fine, all the DLC is available to you. In the EU, not so much. I'd like to be able to buy ""Roadhouse Blues"" by The Doors along with packs only available in the US region (the orchestral/classical selections should be royalty free by now the world over, so why only a US release Ubisoft?).My conclusionRocksmith is a good learning tool to practice to your preferred songs (where available) and if you prefer mid-80s onwards, you're very much catered for.  I'd also recommend Rocksmith as a solid stepping stone to give you a head start when it comes to training DVDs and books, given that you'll have at least a working knowledge of playing a guitar.I'd also advise going in with the mentality of treating songs by artists you're not fond of (or even heard of depending on your tastes) as a level to be mastered.  It works, but songs you actually enjoy may help you better - each to their own in that regard!Have fun though, learn, and impress yourself if no one else that you've learned a new skill!			"

												I like this game, it's really fun, and it's kinda like guitarr hero but more complicated. The only thing is it sometimes has problems registering the notes it seems, especially on the low E string, you have to play the note early in order for it to register that you played it. Over all though it's a good game and it's fun yet challenging.			"

												I loved this game when I first bought it. It was a huge leap toward really being able to play lead guitar for me, and made me feel like a real rock star rather than a cartoon one (as I did when I used to play Guitar Hero).There were a few annoying aspects that I did not like: 1) having to retune EVERY FRICKIN TIME I wanted to replay a song or game; 2) having to escape into a special mode to practice sections; and 3) learning new songs seemed more game-like rather than realistically achieving artistry (wanting to get applause and WIN the level rather than learning to play the song without errors).All these flaws were more than eliminated by Rocksmith 2014, which I love! Session mode: the band that never goes home or gets tired of hearing you riff.I do like the Gamecade games better in this game than the 2014. They work a lot better and I feel like I get more real practice.			"

												Good idea, bad execution.  The game is very glitchy.  Often times, halfway through a song the game stops tallying score.  The guitar tone is still audible but the score doesn't move.  Restarting the game sometimes fixes this problem but not always.  It is very frustrating.  The mini games are glitchy too.  They often say you hit the wrong not when you do not.  Note bending is not accurately registered either.  I have been playing guitar for 10 plus years and I have wanted a game like this since before it existed but I hardly play it because I have to keep restarting songs which is annoying.  Also, the menu is poorly set up.  Options are burried within tabs or you have to scroll too far to get to them.			"

												The way the notes are presented is confusing, especially if you know tablature / notes. The automatic adjustment of difficulty is frustrating at times, making it too easy when you just want to practice the new part, or making it harder than you want when you're starting to get it.Otherwise, it's the best guitar game on the market. Get past those annoyances, and start learning songs pretty fast. Guitar Hero / Rock Band don't really teach you guitar, Rocksmith does. I just wish they would fix the display so it's tablature, because then you can learn to read music at the same time. That, and add in all the other instruments into a single game: drums, piano, guitar, bass.			"

												First let me say I have played guitar on and off for over 15 years and never had the urge to learn songs by other bands.  I bought Rocksmith because I was hoping it would make me want to play more... and it did not disappoint.  Whether you are just starting out or have played for years, Rocksmith will keep the fire going.  The first day I played 4-5 hours straight, and I can't remember the last time I did that.  I always approached the guitar like an experiment; finding my own style and chord changes with little help from outside instruction.  But there is valuable knowledge in learning real songs because you learn new chords, different styles, and new ways to play.  The songs are already written, you just have to learn the changes and finger placement.  There is a plethora of training games that will keep the novice guitar/bass player interested, a riff repeater if you are having trouble with certain parts of a song, and 2 or 3 different parts to choose from for most of the songs (except songs like ""I Can't Hear You"" by the Dead Weather).  It comes with a nice variety of songs to start with, but the downloadable song library is a little thin.  They may have released more for the Rocksmith 2014 version.  In any case, this is an excellent game for anyone interested in learning guitar/bass or simply wanting to keep their skill level up.			"

												I had played guitar for a number of years and in a couple of bands, prior to when Rocksmith was released. Everyone is a bit different when it comes to learning music and/or an instrument. Some people actually do better learning this way than the traditional way. While the dlc's that come with the ""game"", (and I use the term loosely as I see it more as a learning tool), are great, but learning the scales and working on your techniques and fundamentals are necessary when you start playing more difficult pieces as well as music that's not available via Rocksmith. Still, you do have techniques that you can work with in Rocksmith and there's plenty of videos on Youtube, guides on the internet, as well as videos and guides you can buy, be it via youtube or another route. Rocksmith is a great tool. It may not be the only tool you use, but that's a given with anything in life.I would recommend this for guitarists that are intermediate level and above. For absolute beginners, I would recommend learning the fundamentals of guitar and at least understanding guitar tablature first. That is unless you just want to plink around with music, which you can certainly do. You could even learn the fundamentals later, after you've found that you wish to invest yourself into music/guitar later.			"

												I can't say just how highly I recommend this game in such a small recommendation. Seriously, any budding guitarists or bassists need to get this. Music videogames are often mocked by professionals but this game is the bridge you need between aspiring to learn and becoming a pro. You still need to put the time in but like going to guitar lessons you have a helping hand. I recommend putting in 30-90 mins in daily to progressively build up your skills. Play along with the great selection of built in songs, maybe pick up some of the growing number of DLC songs or search around online for you favourite songs added in by modders!The minigames are superb for building basic guitar skills, from moving your fingers around the fretboard to learning your basic scales. With the added leaderboard system to encourage practicing and competing with your friends (looking forward to seeing some of you on there). The initial purchase cost might be a put off but how long ago was it that we were slashing out some heavy cash for Rock Band or Guitar Hero. As a long-time music game lover I highly recommend this.Sadly you won't be learning the Drums here but Rock Band already does a pretty nice job of emulating that so fear not drummers. Guitarists and Bassists need to pick this up though.			"

												This game made me finally start playing the bass I'd had for 2 years and touched maybe twice.  It's so insanely fun.  To be completely honest, it's abilities as a teacher may be a little overhyped.  I'm not an amazing bassist now.  Its real strength is just getting you to play.  And keep playing.  And playing.  A practice motivationizer (that's a word now).Or maybe I'm just a bad student and you'll learn just as easily as the marketing says.  I played saxophone for a really long time before I decided I wanted to rock out hard.  Turns out that playing a horn didn't prep me very well for a stringed instrument.As for the game itself, it does suffer a bit from relatively minor issues like input lag (minor AFTER setting your game up properly - google it/check out the official forums for the in-depth settings guides), clunky interface and menu layout, but honestly as a complete package I think it's better than 2014.  It's just more fun, and a better design.  Playing events with a photo realistic crowd is a blast.   Unfortunately this one is not supported anymore, so if you want new music and the latency improvements, you're forced to 2014.			"

												I've been an amateur guitarrist(with no talent at all) for years, learning by myselft without a proper teacher or music education, when you're learning to play guitar you will find a common problem, lack of motivation, Rocksmith helps you to overcome this problem, at the end of each played song you will be given points and note accuracy, you will want to play more and more, makes you practicing until you get 100% note accuracy, after some gaming sessions you'll start to notice that your skills are getting better, the game includes a section called guitarcade a series of mini games that will help you to improve your speed.Rocksmith fails at some points like a chord dictionary, you will find the chords that you have to play for each song in the game but you can't find chord variations, also the game doesn't show the note you're picking. Despite all of this It's a great game when you know the basics. Remember to get the Rocksmith cable before buying the game, I got mine on ebay for $30, it's worth it, the cable will work with other programs such as Guitar Rig, Garageband, FL Studio, etc. Now grab your dusty electric guitar go and buy this awesome game!

												So, you need a cable to play it but I'm having a lot of fun playing it despite being fairly mediocre at playing guitar! Sometimes I think it just gives me points for being close enough or something, this may deter some people. Also sometimes despite being in tune, my guitar sounds a bit out of tune with the recording or something, so it sounds a bit weird. But over all a pretty decent game.EXCEPT the guitarcade, fun in concept but there are performance issues with it; at least some of them anyhow, Ducks game works fine as far as I could tell but the ones I was really interested in playing like scale runner or harmonics have these tiny glitchy freezes all over the place that makes for a poor experience. :(Good selection of songs. No online multiplayer either, which is kind of disappoint.			"

												If you have an electric guitar laying around and wouldn't mind learning how to play, this is a great way to start. I've been teaching myself for about five years now and purchased Rocksmith on the grounds of learning some songs I have a hard time finding tabs for online. Though I wanted to jump to the hardest difficulty to get a 100% accurate tab instead of every other note in a song, the game insists on taking it easy and adding difficulty as you play along and presumably get better. I'm a bit stubborn so I was a little unsure about this at first- but this is how improvements are made. You PRACTICE. So as I played, I noticed songs gradually start adding more notes as opposed to the simple starting fragments. This system works great. There's also tons of little games to sharpen certain skills. The best feature in my book, strangely enough, became the settings for all the amps. As the owner of an amp with just-alright sound settings, having a ton of new sounds and effects to work with was awesome. I have actually found myself: plugging the guitar into my computer to fire up the game, selecting an in-game amp setting, then plugging my headphone jack into the aux. on my amp, and using Rocksmith as my new amp at the volume of my real amp. Rocksmith is a valuable asset for someone who already plays guitar as well as those interested in giving it a go. Give it a try! "

												Having been playing guitar off and on since I was sixteen I really didn't need a program to teach me the basics. Rather I was hoping for the visceral thrill of actually playing with a band with a recording contract. I got that in spades. The audio fidelity and how seamlessly the game adjusts your guitars tone to match the original master is remarkable. Great, great fun and I picked up a new trick or two in the process. The 2014 edition is a better teacher, but the playlist and sound quality of the original is the best. Not sure why though.			"

												If I had to come up with a short phrase what this game is, I would say ""This is Guitar Hero with REAL guitars!"". Rocksmith is very good with teaching newcomers to guitar on how to actually play the guitar with it's very interactive User Interface, and it records how you are doing on each song you play. If you are doing good, it bumps you up a few notes, all the way until you reach 100% and you are playing note for note, chord per chord. It also has instructional videos on how to do certain techniques and then it has you doing that technique and it makes sure that you are doing the techniques properly.Not only is this good for newcomers or beginners, but it is also useful for experienced and/or intermediate players! Especially when you are really busy and you don't have the time to practice as much, this game really brings you the motivation to want to practice as much as you used to before your busy schedual.The Amp mode is very well thought out, and it very useful for people who want to create their own unique sound with different amps and pedals, without having to buy amps and a lot of different pedals.If you are into guitar and you want a good way to learn guitar without having to pay a lot of money a week for lessons or you are looking for a good fun way to practice different styles of music, then I would say this is the game for you; and before I forget, you can also play bass guitars as well, and you can use ANY electric guitar and electric bass guitar.9/10 - A great game.

												Rating 93 / 100 - Finally the plastic age is over, thank!After abput 15 hours of play, I just want to recommend this game to anybody who ever had the dream of playing (and mastering) a guitar.  In contrast to many of the comments in game magazines I never had any guitar lessons, but nevertheless, that's no problem.I started like many music-gamers with the guitar hero series - nice, but not satisfactory in any way. One year ago I bought my first guitar - a Fender from America - and made my first steps alone until now. So I had a little presentiment of doing it, but no lessons at all.The start of Rocksmith is hard, challenging but always fair. And if you bite through the first 3 or 4 hours, then the ""game"" opens you a new sight and many possibilities of managing your peronal guitar-skills. Sure there are still some bugs and nasty events  in the game, but nothing that a patch could not fix. Actually it is already quite more accurate that any of the guitar-hero games.The negative point is, if you don't have any E-guitar at this time, it is getting expensive. The guitar in the bundle sold by Ubisoft is not much more than a toy; nobody will be happy with that - if you can't get out a straight sound, 'cause your sound pick-ups are cheapest of the cheap, you will stop immediately. So invest your money wisely, but a good guitar should be avaliable for about 500$ already.On the other side, the software-aplifier makes a very good impression; so there's no need for an exra amplifier (if you have the right speakers with a phat sound connected). So, my state is clear - if you're looking for a guitar-training, to improve your skills and be prepared for cramping hands, then I can recommend for 100% sure. It is just making fun, to see youself improving from song to song. But if you are looking for a game - then should get on your console for a guitar-hero session.			"

												If you want to learn how to play the bass or guitar, then this is the route to go.  I've been playing this non-stop and I can tell I am getting better with each play.  I think the best part is you can play ""Super Freak"" and it feels....awesome....But really, it's fun playing songs that you really like.  The visual ques help a lot too.  Get it if you have the loot.			"

												First let me say I have played guitar on and off for over 15 years and never had the urge to learn songs by other bands.  I bought Rocksmith because I was hoping it would make me want to play more... and it did not disappoint.  Whether you are just starting out or have played for years, Rocksmith will keep the fire going.  The first day I played 4-5 hours straight, and I can't remember the last time I did that.  I always approached the guitar like an experiment; finding my own style and chord changes with little help from outside instruction.  But there is valuable knowledge in learning real songs because you learn new chords, different styles, and new ways to play.  The songs are already written, you just have to learn the changes and finger placement.  There is a plethora of training games that will keep the novice guitar/bass player interested, a riff repeater if you are having trouble with certain parts of a song, and 2 or 3 different parts to choose from for most of the songs (except songs like ""I Can't Hear You"" by the Dead Weather).  It comes with a nice variety of songs to start with, but the downloadable song library is a little thin.  They may have released more for the Rocksmith 2014 version.  In any case, this is an excellent game for anyone interested in learning guitar/bass or simply wanting to keep their skill level up.			"

												The way the notes are presented is confusing, especially if you know tablature / notes. The automatic adjustment of difficulty is frustrating at times, making it too easy when you just want to practice the new part, or making it harder than you want when you're starting to get it.Otherwise, it's the best guitar game on the market. Get past those annoyances, and start learning songs pretty fast. Guitar Hero / Rock Band don't really teach you guitar, Rocksmith does. I just wish they would fix the display so it's tablature, because then you can learn to read music at the same time. That, and add in all the other instruments into a single game: drums, piano, guitar, bass.			"

												As a complete guitar beginner, I was given this game by someone upgrading to Rocksmith 2014. Plugging in everything was easy, the first song catchy and simple to pick up, and the song list is impressive. I've improved drastically since starting to play this in conjunction with some how-to videos and a chord book. It's clearly based off the idea and popularity of Guitar Hero, but don't expect it to follow naturally if you are a Hero hero. More finger movement, callouses and goddammit stop scooping the string, you're scooping the string don't do that make for a interesting gaming challenge. It's not perfect: the multiplayer occasionally refuses to pick up the second player (usually me, making my already abysmal scores plummet) and even single player drops quite a few notes if the cord is not aligned correctly. And with the Steam version, you do need to buy that cord seperately. However, I could play this game for hours. Feeling like an actual musician when you can fret without looking at it rocks and the first time you master a chord in-song is the most exhilarating thing. I've seen 2014 played and there is a lot of improvement in the interface, pickup and subtlety of the game, but Rocksmith still holds its own. The songs are solid, the gameplay is intuitive and you get to be a rockstar to crowds of enthusiastic 2d cut-outs. Really something I would recommend to rock enthusiasts and wannabe musicians alike.			"

As a Rocksmith 2014 player I have to say that a mix of the both (Rocksmith and Rocksmith 2014) would be the perfection. The concert style and carrier progression of Rocksmith is what is missing in RS 2014 and the deep lessons and the songs ""monitoring"" system of RS 2014 is missing in RS.			"

												I had thought long and hard about this and almost didn't put a recommendation for this game. But after reading most of the posts about not recommending this game made me change my mind. A lot of the bad reviews seem to be made after Rocksmith 2014's release. Of course RS 2014 is better. However; the content from the first one is worth the price in my opinion. (I own both Rocksmiths for the Playstation from their respective release dates.) I bought a PS4 and loaned my PS3 to my cousin. I missed the game and repurchased RS14 for my PC. That satified me for a while; but I started to miss playing songs from the original. And that is the point for my recommendation. Sure the game play needed to be improved and Ubisoft made those improvements with RS14. I would give this a 5 out of 5 however $10 to port all the originals to RS14 kind of irritates me so I am only giving this 4 stars. It still is an outstanding game if for nothing else than the content that can be ported to RS14.			"

												Guitar Hero Who? Man, this game blows that out of the water. Want to really learn how to play guitar? This is the real deal. And for $10...what a steal! You still have to have a real guitar and pick and you have to get the USB cable to plug into your guitar...but man! what a great learning tool.I already knew some chords and songs, so picking this up didn't have a huge learning curve. But if you've never picked up a guitar before, this might be a bit of a challenge. But the payoff is, you will learn how to really play the songs in the game and real chords and progressions that you can use to train your fingers to play many other songs.The real beauty of this game though come in 2 forms. The first, is that it turns your computer into an amp. As you progress through the game, you earn amps, guitars, and effects pedals. Then, when you just want to practice outside of the journey or mini-games, you have multiple effects and amps to tweak your sound.The second, and most important, is that this game adjust the difficulty in REAL TIME! It is awesome. It senses, mid-song, if you are struggling, and then tones down the difficulty. And, if you are doing well, it slowly increases the difficulty while you are in the middle of playing. If it senses that it bumped up the difficulty too much, it takes it down a notch. Watching this happen mid-song makes what could be a frustrating experience into a very satisfying one. Some songs have easier riffs than others, and to be rewarded for your effort is awesome.Pick this game up and then go look at the library for some DLC. I have added 2 songs to my list of songs from the DLC, and it makes the game that more fun to be able to play along with songs I really enjoy.			"

												This is Guitar Hero with an actual guitar, or bass, if you so choose!I was definitely skeptical about this, as it seemed like a great idea, but I wasn't sure if Rocksmith could deliver exactly what it said it could in a quality program worth the high price. To my surprise, it did end up being worth every penny.The Rocksmith Real-tone cable (which must be purchased seperately) actually works amazingly well, and when you're not playing in career mode or just playing random songs, you can just go into ""Amp mode"" and jam out, which contains an insane amount of custimization for sounds and tones etc. and more can be unlocked and purchased.I really thought this was going to be a hard game, but it starts you off slow and depending on how well you do, difficulty is altered, allowing you to play more notes to a song until by the end, if you're doing well enough, you are playing the entire thing.The game walks you through every step, from the very beginning, and even though some parts here are slow for experienced players looking to jump right into the game, it's definitely going to be very useful for beginners. When you get to more difficult songs that require chords, tremolos, hammer-ons, you name it, there are tutorials and mini games based on playing those notes that will appear, teaching you how to perform them while having fun at the same time. Even when you do lose, you just want to keep going because every time you get a little better, and after mastering any of these, you truly feel like you have become a better player.There is an in-game guitar tuner which works better then any tuner I have ever even used in real life. Before every song, you hit each string, and it lets you know if you're in tune. If you're not, the tuner pops up, and tells you how to adjust. Although this may sound annoying, it usually only takes 3 seconds if nothing has to be tuned, and ends up being extremely useful, and practical, regarding tune-age upkeep.What you are learning here are REAL songs, that you can practice in the game, and then go play later.In only 24 hours I have learned over a dozen songs, and although I can't play them all flawlessly or in their entirety, some of them I've gotten pretty damn close, and eventually with practice, you can nail any song. You literally start to impress yourself with what you have learned in such a short time. I really didn't think it would ever even be possible to learn popular songs without teachers or tablature, it takes up too much time and is frustrating, so I have mostly only ever played by ear or wrote my own material in the few years that I've been playing, but this game solves those issues and proves me wrong.I even reccomend this to people who are still pretty new to guitar. It's fun, and actually makes you WANT to learn, because you see yourself progressively getting better. It's faster and much more simple then using tabs, the only thing is you only have so many songs to choose from.Sincerely impressed by the quality of this game/program/purchase.  They took a great idea, put it together, achieved, and then delivered if not the best possible outcome, pretty damn close to it.			"

Runs great, but the DLC is way too pricey imo. Gotta make money to stay going, but still, how about a package deal. For real.*NOTE: If you are running over HDMI for audio, you may need to setup an analog connection because the multiple conversions that has to happen, causes a slight lag.

												I have been playing bass on and off for like 40 years I guess. I originally learned how to play with Tabs, They were expensive before the web. This game is pretty much set up to teach you how to play the same way I learned. A kind of interactive Visual tab with color coded strings and numbered frets. Latency is just a hair off so sometimes you just can't get the notes in perfect time with the game which is generally frustrating. If you already play, you will have to go through the beginner levels anyway but it works out because you need to learn the UI. The early levels just have you playing a note every 4 or 5 notes while it teaches you timing and that's pretty much how I learned all those years ago when I started. In my opinion this is a little expensive for new content and there aren't many song's included with the thing. It's a money pit and limited to just a few hours before you exhaust the included content. I figure a true beginner would maybe get 40 hours of play before it wouldn't be interesting anymore. It's a good concept but ruined by the need to buy DLC to continue. The included mini games are useful tools for creating skill. They absoluly redeem the game which would have been shallow without them. The Real Tone Cable is no garantee of good latency. The no cable patch (google it) will work just as well. When tuning, always reach proper tuning while tightning and not loosening. Tuner cannot hear harmonics and it is a ""ballpark"" tuner. You will find yourself tuning before you atart the game because it sound a bit flat by the built in tuner.			"

												BEFORE YOU READ THIS REVIEW: AUDIALS INSTALLATION WILL CAUSE THIS APPLICATION TO CRASH RELENTLESSLY. If you have Audials installed, uninstall it and disable the sound capture device - note that Audials will not unstall the sound capture device automatically. So with the uninstall bug with Audials and the sound device bug in Rocksmith, you have an unfortunate pairing of bugs. I found this quite by accident and I hope Rocksmith fixes this fault. This piece of software is really good actually, it will let you:-> Tune your guitar-> Use the computer instead of an amplifier-> Teach you techniques-> It can test your ability in different techniques-> It's smart and it adjusts to your skill level like if you fluff up it'll reduce the amount of notes for you to play so you can find your fingering again, then increase the number of notes as you pick up technique-> It has a number of videos, and suggestions for how to improve playing-> It will suggest tracks that match your level-> It will even f*** off and just let you play the guitar as you want without having to conform to any gameplay rules, which is nice.There's loads of features I like about this ""game"". I don't know if it should really be called a game, because it's more like a virtual tutor. I think it's rather clever actually to make you watch the screen, because by watching the screen, you will learn correct finger placement on the guitar instinctively, just as you can learn to touch type on a keyboard. I think that's a very good skill. My guitar playing is poor, but it's improving. It's amazing how many bad habits you pick up when teaching yourself. This software is undoing those bad habits. Can't recommend this software highly enough!Suggestions to developers: -> It can be really difficult to see the notes on the screen with the background - it would be good if you could turn the background graphics off, then it would be easier to see what we are trying to play. -> Also i'd like a black and white version, as the string colours don't help me at all (I am colour blind) and people work it out from the position of the string being played anyway.

												I loved this game when I first bought it. It was a huge leap toward really being able to play lead guitar for me, and made me feel like a real rock star rather than a cartoon one (as I did when I used to play Guitar Hero).There were a few annoying aspects that I did not like: 1) having to retune EVERY FRICKIN TIME I wanted to replay a song or game; 2) having to escape into a special mode to practice sections; and 3) learning new songs seemed more game-like rather than realistically achieving artistry (wanting to get applause and WIN the level rather than learning to play the song without errors).All these flaws were more than eliminated by Rocksmith 2014, which I love! Session mode: the band that never goes home or gets tired of hearing you riff.I do like the Gamecade games better in this game than the 2014. They work a lot better and I feel like I get more real practice.			"

												The following is my review in pseudo FAQ format. Enjoy! :)Why did I buy Rocksmith?I bought this as a way to learn to play an electric guitar - something that I (and I suspect many others) have wanted to do since childhood but never really had the right tuition or couldn't quite follow along with a book/video. Mainly because you can't necessarily trust an instructor to be able to tell if you're hitting the right notes/chords and a book/video may assume a skill level or familiarity that you, as the learner, just do not possess.Also, as per usual, it was in a sale and it's taken me at least a year to get around to buying a Real Tone cable once the price had come down in price to £20 on Amazon.Do you actually learn how to play a guitar?Yes. Yes you do.  You start with simple single note arrangements of songs, leading to complex single note arrangements and then on to a combination of single notes and chords before going to full chords.  The speed at which you do this depends on what Rocksmith thinks is best for you in terms of your actual ability, with arrangements being made simpler or harder (or truer to the actual song being played if you prefer).  You can also practice specific chords of a chosen song, any part of a song, different arrangements, or change songs in your ""setlist"" to ones you're more familiar with and/or genres you prefer.Starting with single notes, you are also memorising your guitar's fretboard and how far to move your fingers without even counting the frets as you go.  As you progress further, Rocksmith will introduce new elements such as sliding from one fret to another - both as part of the song you're playing and to further cement fret positions in your mind.  Even after a few days to the end of your first week of playing, you'll find yourself being able to play songs with far fewer mistakes (perhaps even perfectly, as of course everyone learns at different speeds).  Certainly, you would have started developing those all important calluses!Okay, I get that Rocksmith is a learning tool - but what's Rocksmith like as a game?As a game, Rocksmith is far more entertaining than say Guitar Hero/Rock Band in that you're genuinely playing along with a real guitar (that needn't cost the same as a Guitar Hero/Rock Band accessory), and is always just challenging enough in difficulty and the side games provide a welcome relief to learning songs and using a real guitar as an alternative controller whilst still being educational.  The Rocksmith Points that you get for completing songs and side games all add up to your resulting score and is a good objective metric of your progress/ability.Speaking of side games, these are unlocked as you progress so that you're never in a position where you are in way over your head.  For example, the first game unlocked is the Duck Shoot where you play single notes on the 6th string in particular fret positions to shoot the ducks, simple enough. But from there as you progress, you'll unlock the scales mini game and so on, providing an incentive to carry on and is yet another way of letting you know how far you've come from starting out.Additionally, there is a multiplayer mode and it's up to you and those you're playing with if you want to be competitive or use it to encourage as a group to all learn a skill.What's the song selection like?Like a higher priced budget collection in that all the songs are well known and like all budget collections, you'll be a fan of some more than others (perhaps by a great margin).  For example: if you want popular 50s rock artists like Chuck Berry and Bill Haley? You're out of luck. There aren't any TV/Film themes either (which are almost traditional to learn) or rock instrumentals such as FBI by The Shadows.If you like Nirvana, Snow Patrol, The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and the like (generally popular rock from the late 80s onwards) then you'll be escstatic and perhaps disappointed your favourite song wasn't included, which is small beer when compared to those of us who prefer 1950s-1970s rock given that we get 8 songs (three of these being by The Rolling Stones - with none of them being Paint It Black! Have to upgrade to Rocksmith 2014 to get that one) out of a total 57 that come with the base game (6 are unlocked as you play, all of which are from 2011).  For the sake of completion, two of the songs from 1988 onwards are Run Back To Your Side by Eric Clapton (2010) and Jarvis Cocker (formerly of Pulp fame) represented with one of his solo efforts ""Angela"" (2009).  For Clapton and Pulp fans (of which I'm neither), this is something of a raw deal given the  respective back catalogues.Well what about the DLC are my/your tastes catered to there?Yes and no. If you live in the US? You'll be fine, all the DLC is available to you. In the EU, not so much. I'd like to be able to buy ""Roadhouse Blues"" by The Doors along with packs only available in the US region (the orchestral/classical selections should be royalty free by now the world over, so why only a US release Ubisoft?).My conclusionRocksmith is a good learning tool to practice to your preferred songs (where available) and if you prefer mid-80s onwards, you're very much catered for.  I'd also recommend Rocksmith as a solid stepping stone to give you a head start when it comes to training DVDs and books, given that you'll have at least a working knowledge of playing a guitar.I'd also advise going in with the mentality of treating songs by artists you're not fond of (or even heard of depending on your tastes) as a level to be mastered.  It works, but songs you actually enjoy may help you better - each to their own in that regard!Have fun though, learn, and impress yourself if no one else that you've learned a new skill!			"

												A great way to have fun with songs you like and the new ones you will like because you heard them in this game. A unique concept. The interface gets annoying pretty quick (tuning guitar everytime, menu animations). Sometimes the game is too easy on you in judging how you played, sometimes its too hard (like hitting bends), so there is some unbalance. But overall great game for guitar and bass players who want to get playing, better at it or just anal in learning their favorite solos.			"

												This game made me finally start playing the bass I'd had for 2 years and touched maybe twice.  It's so insanely fun.  To be completely honest, it's abilities as a teacher may be a little overhyped.  I'm not an amazing bassist now.  Its real strength is just getting you to play.  And keep playing.  And playing.  A practice motivationizer (that's a word now).Or maybe I'm just a bad student and you'll learn just as easily as the marketing says.  I played saxophone for a really long time before I decided I wanted to rock out hard.  Turns out that playing a horn didn't prep me very well for a stringed instrument.As for the game itself, it does suffer a bit from relatively minor issues like input lag (minor AFTER setting your game up properly - google it/check out the official forums for the in-depth settings guides), clunky interface and menu layout, but honestly as a complete package I think it's better than 2014.  It's just more fun, and a better design.  Playing events with a photo realistic crowd is a blast.   Unfortunately this one is not supported anymore, so if you want new music and the latency improvements, you're forced to 2014.			"

												I had played guitar for a number of years and in a couple of bands, prior to when Rocksmith was released. Everyone is a bit different when it comes to learning music and/or an instrument. Some people actually do better learning this way than the traditional way. While the dlc's that come with the ""game"", (and I use the term loosely as I see it more as a learning tool), are great, but learning the scales and working on your techniques and fundamentals are necessary when you start playing more difficult pieces as well as music that's not available via Rocksmith. Still, you do have techniques that you can work with in Rocksmith and there's plenty of videos on Youtube, guides on the internet, as well as videos and guides you can buy, be it via youtube or another route. Rocksmith is a great tool. It may not be the only tool you use, but that's a given with anything in life.I would recommend this for guitarists that are intermediate level and above. For absolute beginners, I would recommend learning the fundamentals of guitar and at least understanding guitar tablature first. That is unless you just want to plink around with music, which you can certainly do. You could even learn the fundamentals later, after you've found that you wish to invest yourself into music/guitar later.			"

Only drawback is that the cable you need to play the game is $30 average but if you can afford it, I highly recommend it.			"

												Redoing this review due to time that has passed and dlc / 2014 release.I personally use the 2014 edition with Rocksmith + import hence the hours made are so few.This version its interface is fairly horrible especially compared to 2014 edition.If your looking at this with interest to buy you likely know what this is for so i wont go into detail.Simply put :Rocksmith : Horrible interface.                   Better songs for ''practise'' as in higher difficulty overall.                   Not all default songs support bass guitar.Rocksmith 2014 : Better interface.                           Average difficulty is to low.                           Best bass guitar support by default.DLC songs : Rocksmith : Bit of everything when it comes to difficulty though not always mentioned if it supports bass guitar.Rocksmith 2014 : Mostly widely known songs selecting popularity over difficulty and evrything shows what it supports and adds to the program.So if you dont want both versions with import tool this will give some things to think about what youd rather have if getting only 1 version of the program.Do keep in mind eventhough 2014's track selection is overall simple if you are completely new you will gain something from it anyways and playing stuff you like could be more fun then managing to nail a difficult song you perhaps dont like as much.And both versions are very lenient in various ways like timing and prescision but it can be a fun way to work on your speed and such. [however things like score attack do take prescision and timing into acount when deciding your score]And Rocksmith Co-op is far more fun then guitar hero >.> especially when your both nailing it.

												I only have a little time with this game, because I bought 2014 first and only now got this one for the songs it has. So keep that in mind when you read this:Compared to Rocksmith 2014, this is an absolutely horrible, god awful game. The main part of it is OK, or as good as Rocksmith ever gets in any version (which can be really quite good), but the training mechanics are incredibly awful, my first impression was ""This has to be the worst possible way to learn a song anyone could think of"". The Free Speed function for example, you miss one note, it rewinds to that note, and expects you to play it and instantly carry on with the song right from there. Pray that you never miss the middle note on a tricky triol phrase for example...Especially if you're a beginner, I beg of you that you only, ONLY consider getting this if you also get Rocksmith 2014 and the song import tool, so that you can play the songs of this game in 2014 version, which is better in every conceivable way, and actually works quite well as a learning tool. Otherwise just ignore this game completely, it might even hurt you more than help you.			"

												This game made me finally start playing the bass I'd had for 2 years and touched maybe twice.  It's so insanely fun.  To be completely honest, it's abilities as a teacher may be a little overhyped.  I'm not an amazing bassist now.  Its real strength is just getting you to play.  And keep playing.  And playing.  A practice motivationizer (that's a word now).Or maybe I'm just a bad student and you'll learn just as easily as the marketing says.  I played saxophone for a really long time before I decided I wanted to rock out hard.  Turns out that playing a horn didn't prep me very well for a stringed instrument.As for the game itself, it does suffer a bit from relatively minor issues like input lag (minor AFTER setting your game up properly - google it/check out the official forums for the in-depth settings guides), clunky interface and menu layout, but honestly as a complete package I think it's better than 2014.  It's just more fun, and a better design.  Playing events with a photo realistic crowd is a blast.   Unfortunately this one is not supported anymore, so if you want new music and the latency improvements, you're forced to 2014.			"

												I played this on my ps3 for a long time and enjoyed the game a lot seeing as the difficulty of the game changes based on your ability to play each song.  The One thing that I am VERY dissapointed in was that I just bought this game on sale for 14.99 ONLY to find out that it is not compatible with Windows 8.1........only Windows 7.  Yes, that's my fault for not looking into that but still, that's a huge let down since I was excited to play it and now I just waisted my money in buying a game on here that I cannot play because I refuse to downgrade my laptop just to play ONE game.  I don't get why the 2014 edition is Windows 8 compatible but not the original version >.>  The game itself is a great game to play, I just wish that they made this playable for Windows 8>			"

												Having played both this and RS2014, I'd recommend getting this first as a beginner. Sure, RS2014 offers new features, new songs and fixes some annoyances, but as a (intermediate) beginner I definitely experienced a smoother start in Rocksmith.The career mode makes you feel much more like you're progressing, the lack of said career mode (which can be cumbersome and frustrating) makes you feel like you're just plucking away at one song over and over, much like learning guitar by yourself using a book/DVD. As a side-note, career mode is not the only feature RS1 offers over RS2014.Thus, I'd recommend getting this game (maybe retail with the cable, likely cheaper than Steam overall, outside of sales) and then ""upgrading"" to Rocksmith 2014 once you've played through a good amount of the career mode, at least that's how I did it and I feel like it was a good transition. I might even rate RS(1) higher, overall.			"

												Well, Rocksmith is the first guitar game (that I know of) to use a real electric guitar instead of the keyboard or any of those gaming-guitars (like GuitarHero etc). And I need to say: It's fun. I started knowing how to hold a guitar, and it made me play several hours a day - getting better and better. Of course it cannot replace your local guitar teacher, but it's worth a try if you own a guitar!			"

												What, you play guitar and if you don't suck you will end up playing the songs note for note. If you're ready to upgrade from simple rhythm games to something that will challenge you beyond the ability to push colored buttons in basic patterns, then Rocksmith is for you. If you find Guitar Hero or Rock Band too difficult, then skip this. If you think that those games amount to little more than a weirdly shaped and painfully simple MIDI drum kit and you own a guitar, then buy Rocksmith and prepare to actually enjoy yourself while learning some new songs!

												Even though I played guitar for a while before this game, I always had an issue with my technique and playing entire songs rather than riffs. After playing for my currently 93+ hours, I can proudly say that Rocksmith is a fun, and surprisingly engaging game (especially if you set up your own, optional training regimen like I did). A minor nitpick would be some of the non-gamebreaking interface troubles I had and how excessively arcade-y the minigames feel. Also, for anyone getting started, I STRONGLY recommend looking up some audio lag guides to smooth out the game.9/10 would space ostrich again			"

												A great way to have fun with songs you like and the new ones you will like because you heard them in this game. A unique concept. The interface gets annoying pretty quick (tuning guitar everytime, menu animations). Sometimes the game is too easy on you in judging how you played, sometimes its too hard (like hitting bends), so there is some unbalance. But overall great game for guitar and bass players who want to get playing, better at it or just anal in learning their favorite solos.			"

												First let me say that this game is pretty good as a learning tool. It's a nice way to work up a song that in the library of Rocksmith. But there are some problems I've encountered with the game. First the timing is a little off. If I wait to pluck the indicated string on my guitar when the note bar hits the string shown on the screen then the timing will be late. I had to pluck the string a little before the bar reaches the string just so the note will be in time with the song.I think that there is a problem with Rocksmith hearing that a note has been played. When I play ""Scale Racer"" in the arcade section Rocksmith, for some reason, doesn't recognize that a note has been played.  I will pluck the string in plenty of time, & the finger is on the correct string at the correct fret, but the car still crashes.There have been several times in Riff Repeater where I play the section with 0 misses, but there have been no increases in the difficulty. It will start the passage around 75% speed, & with each success the speed will increase but the difficulty stays the same. I'll go through this 5 times, & then get bored playing the same very simple passage over & over with no changes in the difficulty. It would be nice if it would increase the difficulty, closing in on how the song is actually played. Also there have been times Riff Repeater has given me only 1 note to play, there is no lead in or clicks for timing so as I mentioned earlier with the poor timing of the bar hitting the string shown on the screen & playing the note makes this difficult.There also have been times when I don't play everything correctly, & Riff Repeater will slow the passage down. Unfortunately many times the voice over will talk right into the start of the passage making it difficult to start playing when the passage starts.Many of the lessons don't sound like there are for Rock, but designed for a Country & Western app. The tuner isn't that accurate. It will lock in tune even before the pitch of the string is exactly where it should be. Then when I check this Rocksmith tuning to my Snark, &  Belcat tuners I find that my guitar is tuned flat. If I tune my guitar to one of the tuners, then the other one agrees that it is in tune. But when I check the Rocksmith tuner, it tells me the strings are sharp.When I go to ""Learn a Song"" unfortunately it always loads at the same song, & I really don't like that song so it's annoying to have to hear this each time I start this feature to learn a song. It's too bad that I can't change the song that ""Learn a Song"" loads with. It's too bad that Rocksmith doesn't have a tab sheet for the song in ""Learn a Song"" that could be used for practice. Speaking of reading tabs, the layout of the strings in Rocksmith is opposite of how the strings are shown in written Tabs.  I've demo'ed playing Rocksmith 2012, & found it to be very confusing. The 2014 version is a noticeable improvement from 2012. So all in all, even with all of the problems, it's not a bad game. And as I mentioned earlier it is a helpful learning tool. If someone asks me about Rocksmith, & if I would recommend it I would have to first let them know about the problems Rocksmith has before I recommend it.			"

												Rocksmith to its core is Guitar Hero with real guitars. It is amazing to see how well the interface between your electric guitar/bass works with the game. Because of this, novice guitarists can more easily aquire a basic set of skills. Its too bad some advanced (shredding) techniques are not available (hopefully there's gonna be an expansion for intermediate guitarists) and this is reflected by the setlist, not a lot of really fast metal, you're gonna have to get that from the DLCs. Even though there are some songs in the setlist I could care less for (they're there mainly to appeal to more pop-oriented people), all in all there's a solid collection of tracks.Because the techniques in the game are nothing new to me, I mainly use it to practice my skills on bass, since my fingerpicking can be a little more tight :)The game does not really support multiplayer as much as Guitar Hero. You can play gigs with your friends of course, switching the guitar every song, provided they have some guitar skills of their own. The learning curve of playing real guitar is still steaper than playing Guitar Hero, although the game supports a dynamic difficulty system, making it a little more accessible (but annoying if you want to really learn the proper way of playing a song, you're gonna have to unlock a master mode first). The game has some mini (arcade) games that do not require much skill and I guess those can provide for some multiplayer.The best thing about it, is that it makes you want to keep on playing and practicing and this is a vital aspect of trying to learn to play any instrument really, so its really more recommendable to novice guitarists, who want to learn to play, but so far really can't seem to put the time and effort in.The game comes with a cable for plugging your guitar into your PC, so its better to get a physical copy from a story with a cable included than just a digital download, because you can't play this game without that cable (and a guitar to plug in to it).

												The first game that started using an actual instrument. Well..... if you don't think about RockBand 3. Unlike RockBand 3 you get to use any guitar so long as it has a 3/4 inch jack. Very fun to use and learn guitar. However, The developers released Rocksmith 2014 which looks better and has more to offer not saying this one is no good at all it is actually pretty good and has decent songs also if you buy this one you can play everything you have previously purchased on 2014 sure it's an extra 9.99 but if you wait until a sale the price is not bad. You only get 52/57 songs and whatever dlc you get when you transfer but I would definitely recommend both Rocksmiths to try			"

												At this point, I would recommend this just to get the songs.  They transfer to Rocksmith 2014 which is a *much* better learning tool.  There is a small fee to transfer, but many of the songs from this game are easier than 2014, so they are great for beginning guitarists.This product was released too early and is really unpolished.  The UI is terrible and there are many small annoying things that can make learning from this product tedious.  Rocksmith 2014 fixes almost all of the issues that I had with this game.			"

												It's Guitar Hero for real guitars, but to sum it up like that doesn't convey the depth of it.As an electric guitar learning tool, this is simply incredible, though be aware that if bought on Steam, it still requires a special ~$30 cable to plug into the 1/4"" jack of a guitar and, of course, a guitar!It adjusts the difficulty on the fly as you play, gives you techniques, challenges, and a reason to come back, on top of having a pretty good song library both in the game and aftermarket.At the end of the day, if you get really good at it, even just on a single song, well, you have the take-away of actually being able to play the song on real equipment elsewhere. What other game has transferable skills like that?			"
