								The game will not open for me and hundreds of other users. When we ask for help on the forums we become banned as if the Dev's do not want potential users to see their problems. Seriously i bought this game and cannot use it or ask how to fix the problem.   This game closes in under 1 second I had to click play 400 times to get the total 5 minutes in game time to even write this review. If i can save 1 person from wasting money than it's worth it			"

								When I wrote my review and said that it would be possible that next week most of the problems would have been solved, I meant as ""anytime soon"". Somehow the developers took it literally and decided to really solve them before weekend. Some aspects of the game are still slow paced and give a browser-based game design feeling, like the rank requirement, or the several days long timers for crafting some items that aren't even something you'd actually desire enough to wait that long. Although you don't need to spend the waiting time in game and may have lots of stations with separate assembly lines.But the game is playable and if you're into universe exploration and a bit of management you can have fun with the game. Most bugs are the kind you'd expect from EA and relogging will fix.The missions still have ridiculously low rewards (worse than shooting trash to sell scraps). But, unlike many other mmos, they're not the main source of money until you're able to work the player market. And the npc ran stations are not the best way to get anything other than fuel. You can pretty much scan a planet and find the $10mil ship.I'm keeping the original review and the patch I noticed the problem solved.. but do look for videos:If you're still making up your decision on whether to buy this or not, make sure you watch gameplay videos.The game seems to have a lot of potential, although it is not likely to ever be a mainstream game. But as for now, it would only be worth buying if it was on a 95%-off sale. Of course, this is early access and the team actually seems to be working, so it is possible that next week most of the problems will be solved. To be fair I'll try to update whenever I see any change. Playing this for 6h, I haven't experienced any sign of lag, only seen minor bugs and got disconnected a couple times. There's only a few problems... have you ever played those browser games where you'd click a few buttons and come back 6-24h later to click a few times again? I had the impression that I was playing one of those. Except that I couldn't just wait the 6-24h. I actually would have to navigate for countless hours to get $4000 and repeat until I make a few millions to get an upgrade on anything.[v7.6.1] After you log in, you get dumped in the middle of nowhere with a ship that will make you wonder if you shouldn't just get out of it and fart your way across the universe to see if you go faster. And, the answer is yes, you would have a much higher chance of reaching something before you die than using that ship. Unfortunately, it's not possible. Along with your space exploring snail, you get a message that seems to be a sketch of a tutorial quest. The problem is that the quest will pretty much tell you to go around the universe looking for stuff and to bring them to someone somewhere. Yes, you have to figure out by yourself where are the stuff they asked for, along with who and where are ""us"" from the message. And you'll probably die in real life before you figure out how many of those you could have found.[v7.6.1] That's about when you'll figure out that other players might be able to help you.. so you decide to give the chat a try. Then you'll hit enter to start chatting and say hi... it won't work.. so you'll try to say ""testing""... then the chat willl open with ""esting"" and you'll find out that the developers decided to innovate and T is the hotkey to start chatting. All fine until you notice you're going in a random direction for a while and try to move your ship. Then you'll notice they innovated even more and the escape button doesn't close the chat... all you can do is say ""wwwwasdadsdwasdaswddsdawdsdawsdwomfg how do I close chat?"". Then someone will tell you to send an empty message to close it. Still all fine.There are some players that will really be helpful whenever they can, and some that will tell you to go play CoD. And you'll probably be directed to the wiki. Don't go. You might feel scammed if you see the part that reads ""We currently have 113 articles about the free-to-play MMORPG set in an Infinite Universe"". It didn't feel very free-to-play when I bought it here in steam.Anyways, after a while you'll feel lost and unsure if you did complete the tutorial mission or not. This will be solved a few hours later when you figure out what the mission dude meant by checking your PDA and you'll see that they actually wanted you to deploy a station. It wasn't just if you wanted a challenge. That was the mission.Then you'll feel desperate because you have no idea how to accomplish that. And at this point anything seems to take at least a couple weeks of non-stop gameplay to be accomplished. Then you find out that the little triangle button is where you get missions from. ""So that's what the chat people were talking about! Holy Crap! 17x323?????"". Yup, the best paying mission is offering you about $4000 to travel 340 sectors. It takes a bit more than 2 minutes to cross 1 sector. Which seems perfectly reasonable given that it would only take like 13h of gameplay each direction and you only need about 5 million to get started. So.. if everything goes well.. you should be able to grab a cargo ship in about 3 years of gameplay (rl time). Then you can start gathering assembly parts to work on a station and complete the tutorial mission.[v7.6] That's when you decide to just enjoy the environment and fly around exploring the universe. You're almost starting to enjoy the game and you suddenly stumble upon an unknown planet! You can name it! Or maybe not. The game asks you to ""donate"" in order to be able to claim objects (to name planets and stars). What in the seven hells do they mean by donating after you just spent so much for the early access of the game (which might eventually turn out to be just for the early access if the wiki is right). I have no idea. No one online was able to explain. But it seems like it means exactly what the text says... after you purchase, there are parts of the gameplay that will require you to make ""donations"". If you pretend you didn't see that and refrain from deleting the game immediately, you might stumble upon the ""wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww Nebula"". That was the apex of the gameplay for me. I couldn't stop laughing when I imagined the player wondering wtf was wrong with the ship that wouldn't move because the game was setting the name for the nebula instead of controlling the ship. [v7.6.. still can't place orders, but the npc stations have purchase orders so you can sell some of the stuff you find] Then you might decide to go to the trade hub people were talking about and make some profit out of the stuff you looted. Only to find out that ""You must own this station to place orders"". So... you need a station to get the money to buy a ship to get the pieces to build the station you need. Either that or you can spend the next few years holding the space bar to save fuel and navigate around the universe on quests that pay nothing.That's about it. This game is not slow paced. This game is too slow to even see something slow paced. It's a slower version of a browser based game adapted so you have to actually spend the countess hours in-game instead of clicking and coming back in a few hours/days. And the extremly slow speed made no sense to me given that the universe is infinite.[turns out that the bug wasn't about having no station, but the map won't show up the edges of the sectors when zoomed out. The station exists right in the border of two sectors and it's pretty tricky to find unless you imagine that zooming in would allow you to see farther.] Other than that, no one was able to explain to me why the game said I claimed a sector but had no station or deployable units on it and couldn't deploy the units I found there because ""someone"" had claimed it. I'm just guessing that's a random bug and the game shouldn't have said I claimed it in the first place.			"

								You enter the game and you find out fuel is limited and there isn't even a HUD indicator of how much you have left (later I found you hit TAB and it shows your fuel above your ship as a % for a brief second). You have no idea what to do, where you're at, or where to go. So you wander around for a while (with your limited fuel). I got lucky and found a fuel station, but with your fuel only showing a % you have no idea how much it takes to refuel your ship so you buy one, but then have to undock from the station to check your fuel level % and redock if you need more.I kept playing because it's like watching a movie that you heard was supposed to be good. Then it starts horrible, but you keep watching thinking in your head, ""this has to get better."" The game starts you with 1,000,000 credits. I found a shipyard  and saw a better (better pretty much only meaning faster in this game so far) the Ship was 1,000,000 and I had 1,000,120 at that time. I clicked to buy the ship to assemble it and it tells me ""insufficient credits"".. so now I can't buy anything with my over 1 million credits.. It gives you a task to build a space station.., What parts do you need? Where do you get those parts? Can you carry those parts or do you need a special ship like in the X series? The Wiki helps a little, but it's out of date, it says your starter ship doesn't have a scanner and it does, but I've scanned dozens of things and never get anything out of it or maybe it really doesn't have a scanner and the button an animations work, but it's not really doing anything, I have no idea. That new ship I tried to buy says it has a scanner..to bad 1,000,120 is insufficient credits for a 1,000,000 credit ship...I don't expect a game to hold my hand and show me everything, but imagine going to sleep tonight and waking up on a spaceship with no sight of any planets or other people or space stations. If the game was realistic, you would die of hunger or asphyxiation before you found anything.The universe is infinite, but who needs an infinite universe when it's empty and nothing to do? If you want a game like this (although it's single player) I recommend Space pirates and zombies (S.P.A.Z.) and it's only $10I would have recommended this game actually if it was $5, but it's $30... This is the first time I've felt a little swindled on these early access games. I understand, alpha's, beta's and early access, but I was expecting a lot more for $30. If you want to donate the money to the games developement, Throw down the $30 and hope they make something out of it, but you probably won't be playing it.			"

								Been playing this on and off for a few months and originally was a founder.  I really liked the concept of this game as I've played several similar games but this game suffers from the same pitfalls of most space games.  That pitfall being way way too much empty space and slow travel.  Nothing is going on in this game still just you and  empty space.  There needs to be a lot more npc type ships and aliens roaming space communicating  with you or attacking with you.  Needs to be a waypoint systems to warp between points.  None of this just you and a slow moving ship in a colorless game because it's space as told to us.  It's been a year so the alpha and beta excuses are wearing thin and I don't see them attracting many more players this way with dead dark grey space.			"

								The ploy of suggesting that this game is hated by many and loved by few may have more to do with the few being those who can actually play.  I bought it because everyhting about it appeals to me.  I'm sure that if I was able to play the game, I would enjoy it thoroughly.  The problem then, is that despite repeated requests for aid in circumventing a bug which prevents me from logging in at all, the devs have simply stopped responding.  Quite a few of us are simply unable to play the game that we paid for.  No one has su[[;ied us with a fix, nor suggested that one will be available in the future.  So, this is a gamble.  If you can play, have fun, but there's a significant chance you'll just be throwing away $30.			"

								This review will be totally honest. When I first started playing I was very confused on what to do. This was mainly because the game doesnt tell you the controls only that you should go and scan everything. Well this is true, to get any loot worth your time you need to fly into the far reaches of space and scan things. There you will find good loot like ships. Now that I know how to play this game seems fun. Right now I can't recomend this game due to it's $30 price tag and it's lack of tutorial. This game is on early access so things are bound to change but at this point in time, I can't recommend this game.			"

								I asked if I was alone in the Universe multiple times as I had seen no one, I never recieved an answer after 2 hours of game play.I ran out of fuel twice ""exploring"" as no one gets 1,000,000 credits anymore, just 20, which you can't even buy fuel with. I tried refueling and I didn't have the credits, so the station's I'm guessing mafia stole all my hull(health?) ammo and fuel I had remaining.Never met a single person, in-game, or in-chat.Gameplay felt pointless as the first ship has no way of making any amount of money to buy other ships. (Think of getting 20 ore per haul. Each haul takes an entire fuel tank that costs 22$ a piece, each ore is worth 1-5$ and to even sell it you have to buy more fuel. Let's also say if you wanted a new ship, they cost 50,000$ minimum.)TL;DR Might as well be just Epic Space: Empty Beta, No progression, No where to go, nothing to do.			"

								Can't recommend the game.The game is currently ifested with lots of bugs. Most of the features are not documented. Have fun studying guides and forums trying to understand how things work.The game has awful user interface and controls. The space is not seamless. It is divided by sectors into grid and you have to travel between sectors by reaching the edge of the sector. Very bad mechanics. Especially for PVP. You can dive in and out of a sector to evade fire. Sectors are pretty small, it takes several seconds to cross one on full speed.There is no map for sectors beyong the core. Even if you will travel beyond the core you have to draw your map of outer sectors by yourself. The game won't help you.There is no minimap of the sector. You will find it very inconvinient to navigate inside the sector.No ship customisation or modules. No base building. You just put a station into space and that's it.There is only crafting in the game. Space factories do not produce anything. They only give you some station specific bonus if you will craft something inside it.Crafting is mostly useless, you will loot or buy items much faster than craft them.The only interesting activity in the game is scanning resource nodes for loot. But there is only one ship suitable for this task - Falcon.The game is sadly pay to win. You can buy in-game money and capital ships for real money on official site. I don't know why anyone would want to waste money on this. The game has several serious duping glitches. Eventually there will be a wipe.The worst problem is absence of any mechanics that will regulate sector ownership. If you will claim it you don't have to do anything, it will always be yours. With station assembly duping most of the sectors are already claimed.Simple ships can't damage stations. The only way to lose a sector is a capital ship attack using torpedoes. And cap ships are only available for real money.It is not massively multi-player online game. It's massively single-player online game. You won't see anyone there, though there is only one server in US that lags a lot.All in all the game will be a stillborn or it will be dramatically changed and released in 2 years. Anyway it isn't worth your time and money now.			"

								I'll update this review as the game updates. As it stands right now, the question you're all asking is, ""Is this game worth £22.99"" The simple answer is.. No. The game is quite liturally full of bugs right now. The sprites are ripped off from much much older games, and the game is lacking any real depth. What happens when new players join in a years time and the only way they can start a faction is to fly for 4 hours in one direction? Who knows... There are far to many un-answered questions.When you start the game, you'll be placed in a neutral sector where weapons fire is disabled. This will give you some time to get to grips with flying your ship, and what to do. You'll no doubt like me, start exploring straight away, but you'll soon be bored and fear running out of fuel, so you'll head back. I spent quite a long time pondering how I would make my first 5mill to get my Falcon. I would need this ship and 20 levels to be able deploy my first station. Soooo I check out the market, sell some items, but wait one second!! Did I just scan some nebula and find a falcon ship? Yes I did! Infact in 1h of doing some scanning I ended up with 3 ships, 3 stations, and a whole heap of crap. Like a giddy school kid, I go grab my new ship, create a faction (Eventually after trying to work out how to do it) And then find a sector of space to deploy it in. I deploy my station, only to have it completely bug out. It's my faction, it's my station, but I cannot name the station, and I cannot set home. Apparently I need to do this at a station that's in my faction land... Ermmmm.. Guess I should tell the game that's what i'm trying to do.The grappling hook at times has a mind of its own. Sometimes thrusting me miles without me even pressing a key. At times my gun just starts ripping at anything infront of me, and half of the time other ships appear doubled, or jump around like crazy frogs. My ping being in the UK is about 130, however I shouldn't not be able to see a 2D graphic run smoothly across my screen. It makes combat practically impossible.The concept is great. But it's not been very well put together. There are very few ppl online at anytime, and apparently they've had to upgrade there servers to handle the new load. They boast one server, one universe... But at the moment, it's looking very unlikely. Hold off on this game till it's free to play. Buying now for the extra 1mill is NOT WORTH it. In 1 hour, I had 15 mill sat in my cargo bay just waiting to be sold.			"

I would have liked to see atleast some physics or even some combat. Updates are iffey if they even come at all. Graphics are ok.. However gameplay is total garbage in this stage. 2/10 Do not purchase.On a personal note I think the devs were listening to this while coding the game;

								This game is in it's infancy, it is described as Beta but is more like late Alpha. The factions (Teams) for this game is broken and allow the faction leaders to completely take the resources of the team members and the member has no say so in the matter. This system leads to abuse. A new player loggs on and they are spammed by faction leaders to join the faction. The leaders knowing that they will end up with that members resources. And if a faction leader quits the game the members of that faction have no way of reclaimingh their resources. BTW to can not claim sectors or even build a space station without joining a faction so you are forced into this situation. If you do create your own faction and then decide to merge with another faction you will completely lose all owned sectors and stations. This issue is still unanswered by the dev, as are other game breaking issues. This game is not recommended until these issues are fixed.That being said if these issues are fixed then this game has potential			"

								Epic Space: Online was a wonderful idea that just never took off.I was so excited when I saw the game on Kickstarter originally and I backed it right away. Endless world exploration MMO?!?!? Yes please. But Epic Space: Online is not a MMO...at all because it lacks the one thing an MMO needs to work. Players.Epic Space failed at the first hurdle. No new players bought the game (maybe due to the price tag, or maybe it just didn't appeal to that many people) and slowly but surely the few players that had invested lost hope and stopped playing too. The developer seemed to sense it was a lost cause, and after trying to add a new deathmatch style mode, gave up and abandoned this game just like the hundreds of others in Early Access.With no players and no updates this game isn't worth a penny which is such a shame because it's potential was truly amazing. Maybe if the game became free-to-play it could attract some people back but I don't see that happening.			"

								This Game is not worth the 30$ price tag. There is a similar flash game called Flash Trek Broken Mirror, that this game hasn't even taken basic notes from, it mostly feels like a small arcade shooter. The system for leveling, seems redundant, waiting for the first of every month to actually gain a rank. Ships are limited, and you start with a very small fighter type craft that is pretty much useless. As you level up the individual ship, through scanning and discovering objects, your ships fuel, cargo, and health go up. Again to me, this seems pointless as simply adding ships to buy would be much more encouraging to actually go out and do things.Making money and leveling up is repetitive, and boring. You are given no direction from the start other then, ""Scan things, make money."" Thanks to the Infinite system, you will not bump into any players, which actually takes the point out of a multiplayer game. You'll come across vacant station left by alliances, but the only thing to do there is ""Sell"" random resources you get through scanning items, that and refueling. Other than that you'll just be floating and chatting, it might as well be a chat hub with a space ship in the back round.			"

								The idea of a 2D eve online game with a more interactive combat system is what drew me to this, I had hoped it would be something like an mmo version of EV Nova. The developers haven't made any updates to the game since 2014. It could have been a great game but unfortunately it's boring as heck and there are bugs with the user interface, you essentially fly around empty space and try interact with objects but the user interface bugs get in the way so you can't even do that, it's impossible to find other players in game and the game is just a complete let down.

								This game is why Steam needs policies in place for development. This is the most dead game i have ever purchased. and sadly, i bought it for $30. no one played almost a year ago when i bought it. no one helped me on the forums. No game enhancing updates, nothing. Oh and supposedly capital ships will cost an ungodly sum of money in game, requiring you to pay real money to obtain them. to the Dev: you got way ahead of yourself thinking you could monetize this like star citizen or EVE. since i can't get a refund, i would seriously like to see steam disable sales of this game until it improves, or dies. it is abysmal.

								This game sucks. It is boring and an absolute waste of money. With 28EUR it is much too expensive, should be around 2EUR. The graphics are lame, gameplay as well... you are drifting in space 99% of all the time. Please throw your money at something else, but not this crap.			"

								All you do is fly around scanning things. I found some loot, tried to pick it up then exploded. This game is also overpriced considering the lack of stuff to do. I guess that's space though. But wait a second! What about other space games like x3 terran conflict or Stardrive, or perhaps a game in the same genre such as Eve online and even Startrek online. They are all full of content and actually fun to play. I feel that the price for this game is really steep. I regret buying it.			"

								Pros:Kinda nice musicCons:Finding ammo, fuel, and other essential resources can take hoursThe in-flight hud covers screen real-estate, and cannot be repositionedGrapics, fonts, and station interfaces all feel like they come from three different gamesSum:The game feels like a reheated lunch made from various leftovers the day after Thanksgiving at a nursing home.None of the game elements fit together properly while each aspect comes from a different puzzle.The reward fonts have no set orientation, and only match the exit button.  The fuel and object fonts cover important aspects  needed to see yur goals and ship.  These fonts are also different, bright and very clashing.The worst part of this entire mish mash of ridiculousness would be the blindingly harsh coloration choices.  Some space clouds make the back of your skull light up.  I've seen Columbians claim extra terrestrial occurences after piloting into a yellow pixel cloud.Anyway, I think I've blown like a hundred bucks or so on early access games...none of which I play or have the desire to return to.  I think this whole idea of crowd sourcing game testers is a really awful idea, and it feels like I'm being conned every single time.  You think I would learn, but apparently not...			"

								Yes, Only played 19 minutes, but it we're the worse 19 minutes ever.Slowpace, yeah, very.... sure, it's a alpha, I can get into that, but really, the instructions are bad, the space is bad, the ship is bad, the controles are bad, everything is just bad, I love space games, I really love it, but this is just...Let me say, you start at the beginning and you get a small tutorial about how to use your ship, using the wsad keys, that you can use your grabhook etc, then you need to find resources to make something, you look into the empty space, find some planets, found a asteroid field and a broken ship.I tried to loot the broken ship but my ship was to small to carry even something? how the hell do I need to loot stuff then? took me 15 minutes to even find something?Sorry guys, but for 30 euro's, this game is totally not worth it, not now atleast, hopefully you guys will find a way to make it better or make more broken spaceships that have smaller loot so you can carry some, make the controles better ( keep the speed of the ship the same while you turn or adjust it just a little, don't make the ships stop, it turns way to slow btw )- Graphics needs a lot of improvement, it's 2D I get it, but the graphics could go way more up for this game )- Make the ship turn faster, it's not a big ship, this should be spinning twice at fast atleast.- Make more lootable things- Better tutorial, maybe with a test area? ( so people actually know what to do )- Better grab hook that only fires from the front of the ship, and not to a random side- Bigger hud, or more visible ( it's to small for a 24"" I guess that has 1920x1080 )Hopefully this is just a alpha alpha ( I said it twice yes ), because it needs a lot of workI'm not trying to ♥♥♥♥♥ of the game btw, again, it's a Alpha/Beta, but it would've been nice to lowered the price a little for the thing you get now ( See space engineers and other space games that are currently in the alpha )			"

								Lots of fun so far.  Exploring can be somewhat addictive at times.  You always want to go one more sector just to see whats out there...  Enjoying building my pirate empire: Shadow Syndicate :)My critiques are as follows;1) Not very much documentation on the game to explain how things work.  There are some old fan youtube videos, an old wiki, and some posts on the forums, but that only gets you so far.2) From doing research I came across pictures / videos of many ships that I cannot seem to find / construct from recipes in the game.  Maybe this is related to my first point, but I have only seen 7 total ships so far on my travels.  Construction of my super carrier (Odin) will make 8.3) There are little bugs here and there, but nothing earth shattering.Overall, I reccomend this game.  I'll be sure to post updates as they come along.			"

								I haven't played this yet and that's the issue. I've spent £22.99 as I saw a couple of gameplay videos and the idea looks great so I decided to buy it.Now that I've got it all it does is take up space on my hard drive as it's completely unplayable. I can't even log in as it constantly has an error saying 'lost connection to ESO Launchpad'I joined up to the forum for the game to ask for support and all I'm told is that the game is fine it's a connection issue. The steps I've been given is to change my ports on my router and add exceptions on my firewall. I don't want to be fiddling around with my firewall and router when all I want to do is play a game.All my other games on Steam are just click and play. My suggestion is to wait a considerable amount of time before purchasing this as I don't think it's ready for people to play.**EDIT** 18/12/2014So I still haven't been able to play this game. My original post on the forums got deleted as it looks like the dev's don't want people to see that there are some people having major issues with it without any help from the dev's			"

								I am really impressed with the quality of the graphics, they very are crisp. The animation are smooth and responsive.I have not interacted with any pirates in the game, I also have not seen any other npc or combat. I am not aware if there are any NPC's in the game or any NPC combat system.I like the way that you can dock into space station and then view the market and buy and sell items.You are able to buy your own space stations with in a sector that is not currrently under any control.At the stage of the developement, the game seems to lack a proper tutorial, however i notice that in alot of alphas/beta's.There is no direction for you in the game to follow.However I see great potentional for this game and will continue to play and follow its development.This review is based on the small amount of playtime i have had. My views and opinions could change as the development progresses.If anyone is interested in checking out the game I stream most days at www.hitbox.tv/Dreayven just send me a message on twitter @Dreayven and i will do my best to stream it for those who would like to check it out.ThanksDreayven			"

								I know everyone has something to say about the 30.00 price but I have to say... You have to look past the 2d graphics and think about what you actually getting with this game. Its just incredible. And the community so far is super great. The game is so new and small that Im editing the wiki daily on basic items, helping countless people in game, and on top of that Ive been on with the Dev playing and talking to us all a couple of times so far. I dont have time to sit here and list this that and the other.... BOTTOM LINE.The game is what they say it is, it does what they say it does, its small and able to be shaped directly by YOU/US, and they are already making really amazing updates with a ton of things we talk about in game in less than 48 hours after release.If you dont want to play the game for 30 bucks that cool, but people are paying way more for WAY WAY less all over steam. This is a true MMO and its the wild west out there. Name planets, make space stations, and chat with the dev and make things better for all of us. Get it.			"

								EDIT: THIS GAME WAS ABANDONNED. DO NOT BUY!***************************What is epic space online? An action filled space fighter game? No! (not yet at least, with the next update it will feature some promising pvp). What it is is basically an empire building / exploration game. I will discuss both aspects seperately.1) Exploration: What should an exploration game feature?In my oppinion, three things: 1st: Plenty of space to explore, featuring the ""lone explorer alone far away from civilization feeling"". Epic Space delivers, since it's a procedural game with an infinite universe. - 10/102nd: An incentive to exploring. Ideally some kind of loot, which may be valuable artifacts or derilict ships or something like this. In Epic Space, you have a lot of variety in loot from scanning celestial objects you discover, most of the time it's relatively worthless stuff, but you can find ships, deployables, even station asseblies. Or the jackpot, Pioneer Letters, which sell for a large amount of ingame $ to NPCs. So I am fully satisfied in this regard, too. - 10/103rd: Variation. There should be different kind of objects to discover, maybe alien races to interact with, or npcs. Or something else. Here Epic space offers differnt kinds of celestials (Asteroid belts (which can be mined for ore), Planets, nebulae, etc.) however they all feel quite alike atm. There are no alien races yet, and the only NPCs are the rare pirate outposts players can find, which are defended by stationary flak turrets and often yield rich loot. However they are no challenge, since a player can shoot further than them. So all in all, this aspect still has room for improvemt. - 5/10So for the exploration aspect, i would rate this game as a 8.3/10 in total.Empire Building:From an Empire building game i expect the following aspects: 1st: The ability to build a huge empire, without any unnecessary restrictions. Here Epic space delivers due to it's procedural nature, allowing you to control an infinite amount of sectors. - 10/102nd: Incentives to do so. Why have a big empire in an infinite universe? Well in ESO, there currently are 3 reasons:1) The monthly payout: Each sector will pay a given amount (which changes, haven't figured out yet according to which pattern) to each member of a faction. This amount is small for a single sector, but if your faction controls hundreds (which actually doen not take long to achieve) it will be several million $ per month per member.2) The Faction Ranking. Everyone wants to be #1, easy but effective incentive ;)3) Resources. You can only set up harvesters (deployable mining stations) in sectors your faction controls. So sectors which have many different ore belts are rare and valuable. So i'd also rate the Incentive aspect as 10/103rd: Empire Control. In a good empire building game, I'd expect some good control/managing featurs for controlling ones empire. In this regard, ESO still disappoints. There is the possibility to transfer sectors to other factions, but that's it. No map, no advanced features. No global controls for faction npc-turrets - in fact only the faction leader can program them, and has to visit each one individually (my faction has A LOT of such turrets). So empire control gets a 0/10.This brings me to a 6.7/10 in Empire Building.3.) Other Aspects.While I believe in rating a game for what it's trying to be, there are those side things that really make you stick to a game and like it. So I feel i have to include them, too.1 - Combat System. Combat is very basic in ESO. You point your ship in a direction and fire, and it shoots in that direction. Things are a little bit more sophisticated with missiles and torpedos. But basically it's a simple yet robust combat system, and actually requires skill and not only stats to deal damage, especially hitting moving targets isn't easy. It atm lacks variation, though so i rate it 8/101a - PVE. The onyl pve atm is shooting stationary NPC turrets guarding pirate outposts yielding loot. I am always excited if I find one, but that's really not much PVE...so 4/101b - PVP. I have not yet shot another player, there will be dedicated pvp arenas coming with the next update. Thus i won't rate PVP atm.Thus, combat - 6/102- Community. While outstide of the developers control, the community is an important aspect of a game. I have found the ESO community to be extraordinarily friendly and helpful - 10/103- Crafting. ESO has a tech-tree like crafting system that allows for manufacturing of every item in the game. At the moment, not all resources are harvestable however and can only be found by scanning objects in space. This makes the crafting system pretty useless as of now, but it is a good system in principle, and will allow for a diverse industry and market once all resources can be harvested.  Still, atm it has only little use. Thus 5/10.So my ""other aspects"" rating is 7/10. This brings me to my conclusion...Overall I think Epic Space Online is an awesome game, which kind I have been waiting for. It is however not for everyone, since it is extremely slow paced (like glacial). Atm it still lacks content, but basic functionality for many aspects of the game is there, enough to make it enjoyable to play - it got me addicted, i haven't played another game in 3 weeks (I was spending far too much time working, but still...). If you think you'd like a blend of a ""strategy"" browser game you can actually fly around in, and the exploration aspect of the ""4x"" games, AND are very patient, then you will like ESO. My overall rating, under the premise that this is primarily an Exploration/Empire Building game is  7.3/10 for a game which has a lot of potential but still needs much more content. (Yes this is Early Access. I however believe that something which is available for money in a store counts as ""released"" and thus should offer a worthwhile experience and should be measured by the same standard as any other game. Supporting the devs is all nice and fun (and i invested quite a bit in ESO) but this is steam and not kickstarter)			"
