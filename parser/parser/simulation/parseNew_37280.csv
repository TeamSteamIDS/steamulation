												Like all DASH games, the formula is the same but the toppings are different. If you like these kinds of games then this one is a no-brainer! Great for soon to be Weds!			"

												I love this game but was disappointed when playing it. I don't think it was worth $10. The game itself is a little glitchy and is constantly quitting unexpectedly on me.			"

												This is the Sequel to Wedding dash, similar gameplay as the previous one and the diner dash games :) It's all about keeping everybody happy and making as many chains as possible. Easy and fun, and a perfect game for killing time without thinking too hard about what you are doing. Would have been extra fun with steam achievements :)  And it's weird that Wedding Dash 1 and 3 isn't on steam... If you like time management games, cute characters and the other dash games then this is a fun game for you :)			"

												If you are like me and enjoy Diner Dash and the other many Dash games, than you should enjoy this one as well. It's quirky, quite easy and can be played a little at a time or a lot. No matter what you are doing this game will give you some time to kill and something to do that can be kind of fun.			"
