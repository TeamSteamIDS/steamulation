												Fairly decent Jigsaw game but for the love of all that is good and just in this world give the option to turn of the sound of that water bamboo tippy thing. ITS SO ANNOYING.  For an otherwise quite relaxing game that sound makes me wince every 10 seconds . **Update** The above is no longer an issue! Very impressed that the developers actually listened to my wee moan. A rare thing indeed in todays gaming industry. I heartily recommend this game , very relaxing and a good way to unwind.Many thanks indeed Decayinglogic! I'll be sure to follow your future projects.

												So why do I not recommend this game yet still love the game???? Well the answer is quite puzzling...Let me begin by saying that if you enjoy a good jigsaw puzzle you will find great enjoyment within this game. There is a definite feel of working a jigsaw puzzle here and it's quite relaxing and enjoyable. The pictures are decent and give some good challenge in matching up the pieces and once you get to the larger piece puzzles it really feels like your working a real jigsaw puzzle on a table top. Another interesting slant on this game is that in many puzzles the pieces are cut in ways you could never cut a real life puzzle. This is good in the sense that it opens up new challenges with matching up pieces and actually adds to the puzzle experience in ways that only a virtual puzzle could. It's bad in a way too though because some of these cut styles up the difficulty in matching pieces by cut to sky high levels that make it nearly impossible to do, leaving you to rely on color matching alone. If you’re looking for more challenge though this is certainly a way to get it in ways that physical puzzles could never match so I think this is certainly a positive overall.So where does it all go so wrong?? It's a couple of things that on the lower end, smaller piece puzzles, you won't experience too badly but as you climb up to the high piece puzzles will have you ripping your hair out. The first and most obvious fault is that there is NO mid puzzle save feature. On the small piece puzzles this isn't so much an issue as you can solve them in 15-20 minutes tops. However as you approach the larger piece puzzles this becomes an issue as most people don't have all morning or night to finish a puzzle. Your only option is to leave the game running in the background of your computer, which isn't a horrible option, but sucks down your computers resources if you'd like to go play another game for a while or sucks down electricity if you'd rather just power down your computer for the night.... And there's really no excuse for why the developers couldn't have coded a simple mid-puzzle save feature for this.The second flaw is in piece selection. The pieces float around in a ""river"" around the puzzle which honestly works as it allows you to see the pieces and really resembles the pieces in a box being shaken around a bit only probably better as all the pieces are right side up. Another area where virtual is somewhat better than real life. The problem occurs when you see a piece floating out there amongst all the other pieces that you know fits somewhere and you go to grab it, it's as if the program actually goes out of its way to give you every piece except the one you want.... You'll be clicking and clicking though a million pieces just to get the one you want that you can see right in front of you. Several times per puzzle I've clicked on the piece I wanted while it was clearly in the open, with my curser only touching that piece, and been given a different piece. Then when I release that unwanted piece back into the river the piece I wanted disappears from its current location and reappears somewhere else, usually in a mess of many other pieces again..... Super frustrating.At the end of the day, because of those flaws I cannot in all fairness give this game a recommendation. These are flaws that could have, and should have been addressed by the developer before or soon after the game was released. Is there a market for virtual jigsaw puzzle games?? I think the answer is yes. Ways to improve upon the design?? First off mid-puzzle saving is a must. Second off improve the puzzle selection process and perhaps give us two to four ""ponds"" to place specific pieces in where they will float around separated from the river. Lastly, maybe allow for players to use their own pictures to create their own original puzzles. Maybe even have a Steam Workshop for those puzzles..... I certainly think there's a market for jigsaw puzzle games but this one has too many frustrating flaws to really grow that market...			"

												Pixel Puzzles is a fun little game to kill time with. There is a handful of puzzles and completing them will unlock greater difficulty ones, as well as a level increase to your profile (the ranking is only ''to be''; it won't affect your gameplay experience in any way).As you may guess from the title, this is a Japan-focused game in the ''Pixel Puzzles'' series. Thus, all puzzles are set in a japanese landscape.However, as simple and relaxing this game may sound, there is a very annoying bug when picking up puzzle pieces. It's usually never the piece you click on, but the one nearby. I don't consider this a game-breaking bug but it can be very frustrating at puzzzles with hundreds of pieces, where you can barely pick them up. Not to mention, there is no ''Save'' function. If you've embarked on a 300 pieces puzzle, you need to either stay there for an hour or two and finish it, or remember the pieces' position. This is because the screenshotting option is disabled in this game.The game only has one, repetitive song during puzzles. I ended up muting the game and playing my own music in the bakground, I recommend you do the same.Pros: + Fun and relaxing game, excellent to pass time with;+ Puzzles with different difficulty levels which are unlocked as you complete easier ones;+the hint system is balanced, so players won't spam it;Neutral: +/- The ranking system is only there to fill the game with a new element; it doesn't do anything, but some players may like seeing the monk leveling up after completing puzzles;Cons: - Picking up the piece you want is a pain; they are always moving in the background and cursor will pick up another one;- Only one, repetitive soundtrack;-Missing save button;Buy it while it's on sale if you're into the casual genre, you won't regret it.Personal rating: 75/100 - Good			"

												Played it to completion, relaxing and enjoyable at first, but becomes annoying and frustrating after a certain point.The Good :  A simple jigsaw puzzle game, no time limit.  Each piece is cut differently.  Different difficulty levels from 60 to 350 pieces.  You can change the background color.Neutral :  Relaxing sountrack but repetitive.The Bad :  Low quality images with mediocre variety.  No space to organize pieces.  Cannot connect pieces to each other, they only lock to their exact position on the board.  Hint system is random.  Pieces are constantly moving in a small area, so you can't see all the pieces at once.  In later puzzles picking pieces is somehow random  Puting back a piece in water and all the area disappear.  The piece's space on the board is sometimes larger or smaller than the piece but it magically fits.  You can put random pieces to the board, trying all rows and columns and hope it fits ...  Only 21 puzzles, no free DLCs as mentioned. Note : 4/10 Mediocre  "

												I enjoyed Pixel Puzzle: Japan, for what it was.This game was exactly what it claimed to be. A Jig-Saw Puzzle Game with the puzzles being pictures from Japan.It's fairly relaxing, due to there being no timer, alowing you to take as long as you need to complete each puzzle. The game has 19 puzzles. There's not much variety, other than the different puzzle-pictures, & different sized puzzles. Sizes start at 60pieces, then 112 pieces, 153 pieces, 220 pieces, & the last puzzle has 350 pieces. There are 26 Achievements, & all are easy & involve finishing all the puzzles.			"

												I like this game but its so limited with only like 12 puzzles. It needs more puzzles or a way to use your pictures to create your own puzzles. I have had no issues with this at all. Great work more scope for this to be improved to make it even better for me. Needs DLC'S AND A PUZZLE CREATURE I think this would make it future alot better for people to buy it.			"

												While I enjoyed this game, and played it to completion, one particular flaw was simply to big for me to recommend it.First, the Good:1. It's jigsaw puzzle game on Steam!  2. Plenty of pictures gives you plenty of jigsawing to do3. Different puzzles have the pieces ""cut up"" very differently, adding to the variety4. As you'd expect, it's pretty relaxing just slowly taking your time to work on the puzzle, and then it feels really good when the puzzle is almost completed and you can just plop the remaining free pieces in the remaining holes without any searching :)The Bad:1. The worst issue with the game - picking the puzzle piece you want out of a group of other pieces is an exercise in frustration, especially in the latter puzzles when so many pieces are floating in the river.  You can click directly on a puzzle piece, and the game then hands the piece that was hiding underneath it - over and over again.  I sometimes took me literally a dozen tries to pick up a single puzzle piece!  This one flaw by itself is what had me click the ""No"" for this review.The final puzzle is by far the largest, and has 350 piece.  As soon as I started it and saw the river absolutely full of overlapping pieces, I despaired - only to find out, to my amazement, that I was flawlessly picking up every single piece that I was intentionally clicking on! 30 pieces in a row, with no mistakes - what sorcery is this???  It's as if the QA testers complained to the programmers that this puzzle was unplayable, and they fixed the issue only in the final puzzle.  Yes, it seems ridiculous, but I honestly cannot think of any other explanation.  2. No way to save progress in the middle of a puzzle.  Some puzzles take hours to do, and if you exit the game, you gotta start them all over!3. The music, while pleasant enough in the beginning, just loops over and over and over, and it's the same song for every single puzzle.  Thankfully you can mute it, though that also mutes the few sound effects.4. The colors in a most of the pictures seem washed out, though maybe that's a style thing.The Differences From Physical Jigsaw Puzzles Which May Be Good or Bad Depending On Your Point Of View:1. The puzzle pieces are always oriented in the proper direction, so there is never any need (or ability) to rotate them.2. When dropped on the board close to their correct spot in the picture, the puzzle pieces automatically shift and stick there.  There have been many times where I'd accidentally plop a piece down in the right spot.  This also allows you to ""hunt"" for the right spot by just moving a piece around the board in small increments.3. There is no way to stick two puzzle pieces together when you know they match each other, but do not know where exactly in the picture they belong. 4. The only way to view the full picture of the puzzle you're solving (without taking a screenshot of the level-select screen) is with a hint-style button, which slowly lights up as you place pieces in their proper spots.  When you do use the button, it turns the board you're solving into the complete picture for a few seconds during which you can still move and place the puzzle pieces.So yes, I mostly enjoyed the game when it was not frustrating me with the puzzle piece selection issue.  If the devs fix that, I'll switch the recommendation to Yes.			"

												This is probably the most creative interface I've seen for a jigsaw  game on PC or mobile. I love the way this game solves the problem of displaying the unused pieces while still allowing a full frame to work the puzzle. The koi pond and ""fishing"" for the moving pieces is very relaxing and fits well with the theme of this puzzle series. (Edit: This feature gets less ~relaxing as you hit the bigger puzzles since it's really tough to select the piece you want.)The artwork (both in the interface and the puzzles themselves) is very nice, and the music and sound effects also blend well with the overall theme. I also like the way the monk ""levels"" up as you solve puzzles, it just adds incentive to keep going.Unfortunately, the pieces don't rotate and you can't connect pices that aren't already in the correct spot within the puzzle frame. You can, however, lock pieces into place by luck or trial and error, even if you have nothing adjacent in place. I really wish this game had a save feature that let you save your progresss as you work the puzzle. If you only want to spend a few minutes at a time playing, you have to start again from the beginning.Basically if you like working jigsaw puzzles but hate the effort of setting up all the pieces while sacrificing table space for the time it takes to finish  (not to mention keeping your cats away) then this is a great game for you. It's also a good time spinner when you just want a chill game that doesn't take a lot of concentration.			"

												For what it is, its a good little game. Its a time waster when you want to relax from blasting aliens or racing cars at 200 mph. The pictures are really nice, and the music is pretty relaxing. The extra pieces float around the board in a pond, so that you can see the remaining pieces you havent yet put into the puzzle. Achievements are easily attainable, each one cooresponds to a puzzle you need to complete. No time limit, no fancy business, just complete the puzzle, achievement pops. One thing I didnt see was a save feature. Kinda silly not to have one. I've only done the shorter puzzles, but later on it could get annoying if you want to hold onto your progress and finish up another day. If you want a jigsaw puzzle game, this will scratch that itch.			"

Short version: 63%Pixel Puzzles has beautiful pictures and soothing music, but for a jigsaw game, it is lacking: the tiles are not customisable and you cannot use your own pictures or music. At least it is cheap and has Steam integration.Long version:Jigsaw video games are simple stuff. All you need is a decent algorithm for the tiles, good-looking pictures, and some customisation options. Pixel Puzzles: Japan meets the first two criteria and completely misses the third.The theme is Japan, so the pictures show the best tourist traps that country can offer, with some traditional (but still Western audience compatible) music in the background.As the game progresses, the number of tiles per picture increases, along with the variety in edge shapes. The tile design for the most part is acceptable, although in later stages the small ones can be problematic.While the initial 18+2 puzzles are nice, they are also the entire content: you cannot add own pictures, cannot even modify the setup of the original ones… the player has no control, therefore, the game has zero replay value. Which in a jigsaw game is probably the biggest drawback that can ever be.			"

												If you like jigsaw puzzles and have enough patience to spend even a couple of hours until you finish one, then this game will probably be fun for you.There are currently 19 puzzles to complete (with 2 extra recently added), each of them rewarding an achievement. The difficulty of the picture and the number of pieces scale with level. However, since this game does not have a save option, you might be required to allocate a few continuous hours from your time in order to solve some of the more difficult puzzles. I also found a bit frustrating the fact that the available pieces move non-stop and stack on each other, making the selection for a certain piece very difficult. Even more so, when you click on a specific piece, the game often offers you randomly one from its vicinity instead of the targeted one.More reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page "

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is actually the first jigsaw game on Steam and adds a few nice twists that would not be possible with a physical jigsaw puzzle. As the title suggests, the focus is on beautiful Japanese scenes that are revealed as you progress through the nineteen puzzles that are available.The basic goal is to assemble a picture by fitting together the puzzle pieces. The puzzle pieces come in all shapes and sizes so you have to pay attention to the image and the shape of each piece to figure out where it fits into the picture. Puzzles in this game range from ones with 60 pieces to one with a whopping 350 pieces. Instead of using the box cover as a reference as you would with a traditional jigsaw puzzle, this game gives you a blank slate to work with. You can view a small picture of the puzzle before attempting it, but after that you are essentially working blind. As you put together the pieces an ""I Ching"" meter is filled which, when completely full, allows you to view the full picture for a few seconds.Each puzzle in the game not only has a different image, but the actual shapes of the pieces differ as well. Some of the puzzles have pieces with very strange shapes that you won't see in real-life and it adds another layer of challenge. You don't have to worry about time limits or objectives though. The visuals are rather nice for a casual game and I quite liked the Japanese scenes of bridges, pagodas and cherry blossoms. Like the gameplay, the audio is very relaxing with some soothing tunes and the sound of a shishi-odoshi.If you are looking for a nice relaxing game where you don't have to worry about quick reflexes then you can't go wrong with Pixel Puzzles: Japan.

												Find a picture that looks like a typical Japanese landscape, turn it into a jigsaw puzzle of unusually shaped puzzle pieces, put all the pieces in a pond with koi fish, take some relaxing songs and put them on a short repeat, get one of those bamboo water features that clunks every few minutes as it fills with water and finally a mouse that does not click where you want it to. That’s Pixel Puzzles: Japan!This is a typical 2014 jigsaw puzzle solving game, where the gameplay is pretty much what you'd expect, although it does offer some interesting features which differ it from the wide variety of jigsaw puzzle games on the market. It certainly does have a traditional Japanese feel, especially with the  Koi pond  filled with water and floating Lilly pads.As with a traditional jigsaw puzzle, the most efficient way to complete it is by finding the edge pieces first and then working your way inward. If you place a piece correctly, it locks into place and cannot be removed again by accident which is useful.The game utilizes a sort of an original “fishing” mechanic in order to to retrieve the puzzle pieces. They can move around  and you have to “fish up” the piece you want from a koi pond that surrounds the play area. Using a piece is just a matter of dragging it out of the pond and placing it somewhere. My opinion is that it is an interesting way to show all of the unused pieces without struggling to fit them all on the screen. All in all, there are 21 puzzles for you to solve (unlocked by playing from easiest to hardest). Each of these are tiered by difficulty, starting with the lowest piece count and eventually reaching over two hundred pieces per puzzle. The puzzles themselves are images of landscapes or buildings from Japan. Depending on the amount of puzzle pieces and how keen your eyesight is, some puzzles can take quite a while to complete. Unfortunately you cannot save a puzzle that is in progress so if you have to stop playing in the middle of a puzzle your only option is to minimize the game. Overall, if you are looking for a good and relaxing game where you don’t need to worry about quick reflexes, then you can’t go wrong with this one. Being a fan of jigsaw puzzles obviously helps, but the game has enough unique touches to make it appealing to all fans of casual titles.			"

												This was a very fun game. Obviously, you are putting together puzzles, and there are a few different dynamics at play like moving pieces and such. Additionally, as you progress, the puzzles get more difficult with more intricate pieces or puzzles like the cherry blossom one where the color scheme is essentially the same throughout. I would have liked to seen a save system mid puzzle, and the pieces could sometimes be challenging to grab, but overall, this was a pleasing game that is easy to recommend.8 carp out of 10 possible swimming in a coi pond within a beautiful Japanese garden.

												A fairly straight forward jigsaw puzzle game, in fairness.I think I got this game for free from some kind of site promotion and it seemed like a fairly easy game to 100% so I thought, why not? After all, nothing wrong with a good jigsaw puzzle every now and then. This is a nice and relaxed game for when you just want to chill out but exercise your brain a bit. (But not too much)You have 19 main puzzles, which vary in size and difficulty and 2 bonus puzzles that must have been added in later on. The way it works is that the pieces float and move around on the sides of the screen in the water, you pick out pieces and put them together. Simple!The only problem I had with this game was that towards the end, the bigger puzzles with around 300 or so pieces in the water, it became harder and more tedious trying to pick out the right pieces you want. Although it’s not all that hard to get around so that’s as far as you are going to get in terms of stress. To 100% the game you just complete every puzzle. That’s it. It’s an easy one.The scenes are nice Japanese themed scenes, some are harder then others but in general they are all nice to look at.All in all it’s a nice little game to steer you away from the bigger more stressful games that you may have in your games library.TL;DR : It’s a nice relaxing little jigsaw puzzle game, it’s pretty straight forward and it’s an easy 100%ed game.

TL;DR – If you enjoy real life jigsaw puzzles at all, this will give you hours of joy. Use it to unwind! If not, I don’t see how this game would differ from the real thing enough to show you the joy of matching pieces for hours on end. Recently Indiegala had a free giveaway of Pixel Puzzles: Japan and Commando Jack so that’s how I came about this game. The most I’d heard of Pixel Puzzles: Japan was from achievement threads on the forums and how it was an easy finish(?). The achievements may be straight forward enough, but this game, like the monk that smiles peacefully at you through the whole experience, will make you start twitching like a broken robot (it ain’t easy). I spent 10.5 hrs, spanning two days finishing this game. When I pick it up I’m thinking this’ll be easy as I’m an intermediate puzzle completist and completionist. This was a calculated presumption as when I was twenty one, I had a crazy stalker who scared my family and me so intensely that for a while (until we sorted the whole situation out) I would be cooped up at home and with a fixation of my own, jigsaw puzzles. I’d start at the living room table and end up moving to the floor for space. Family members would come and go to help with the progress and basically it would be hours of just staring at a bunch of puzzle pieces. This went on for a few months and by the end of it I was a fairly confident matcher of jigsaws. I also found some fantastic jigsaw puzzle enthusiast friends along the way! Even without the relaxing chimes and trickle-clunk repertoire of the shishi-odoshi (bamboo water pipe), which can be enjoyed whilst playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan, jigsaw puzzles are the epitome of equanimity and tranquillity. Some people wonder how exactly the tedious matching of a couple of hundred jigsaw pieces can ease stress. Most I know tend to feel better when they have something to keep them busy. Jigsaw puzzles enhance this experience by giving you improved concentration and a zen state of mind. The first two hours of my play time sprung from my idiocy of not knowing how to start the game. I had no idea I was meant to choose one of the lower levels to the left and then press the black and white go button to the bottom left of the screen to start my journey. So I spent 2 hours piecing together two high level puzzles and failing to level up for it. Like actual puzzles, the more pieces in the puzzle, the higher the replay value is so even with the actual 8.5 hours I took to complete this game, I bet I could play it over a few more times before getting bored. I actually had fun playing the harder levels straight off the bat even though it was challenging. The puzzle pictures are pretty and pleasant and everything is simplified with just you and your mouse clicking away. You have a koi pond surrounding your “puzzle board” where a nishikigoi swims around with the pieces of your puzzle. Puzzle pieces keep floating around the pond and it will be difficult to “fish out” the exact piece you’re looking for because of this. You click the piece you’d like to use and put them on the board in front of you and keep looking for jigsaws to make your final picture. The board can be viewed in a variety of colours which will help later on if you’ve misplaced pieces at the end. It is possible to take the koi out of your pond and place it into your bamboo stick (part of achievements). When you place pieces on your board there are two points to consider. One is that when your piece is put onto or very near its proper place, it’ll automatically shift into that spot (handy). This means you can use this when you can’t quite place a puzzle piece but you know whereabouts it may go. The second is a little cheekier and visibly up voted in Pixel Puzzle: Japan’s community hub as a cheat method. You can pile pieces directly on top of each other so that when you click the pile, the pieces will be selected in order from left to right of the actual puzzle. It’s simple and effective even if it isn’t placed quite on top of each other and isn’t in perfect order, but this play method will bore you so I recommend you don’t do it unless you’re near the end of a puzzle and would just like to stack pieces so you don’t lose any of them. I’ve already mentioned this twice so I might as well articulate this problem; you may lose sight of the last 1-2 pieces of a puzzle when you’re close to finishing it because it’ll be on top of some other puzzle piece and camouflage itself. This isn’t too bad because when you find the correct spot for a piece and it clicks into place, you can no longer move it. So when you lose a final piece and can’t find it, just drag your cursor around until a random piece moves. This is in relation to one of my favourite parts of this game because with physical puzzles, you’re constantly left with extra identical pieces and missing pieces that you have to send out for which is the downside of physical jigsaw puzzles. I no longer have to fret till the end, wondering if I’m going to be left minus a puzzle piece. Hooray! Another lovely part of this game is that puzzle pieces have the wackiest shapes. Some look like various animals, others are swirling like something Dr. Seuss made and are very cool. Though first impressions make it seem daunting, the original shapes will work out in favour of your game play as it’s easier to spot pieces which fit. The first few levels aren’t necessarily in order of difficulty. I find lines easy and flowers hard so the levels fluctuated for me but by the last few levels, difficulty rises progressively and steeply. Yet it was always rewarding to see the final completed puzzle image (you don’t see a clear image of the original picture beforehand) as a fan of Japanese culture (the theme). Even with a simple game like this there were points I found were in need of improvement. There isn’t a save button so if you feel tired and want to rest your eyes a bit or try and pick it up tomorrow, TOUGH! You either lose your progress or keep pinching yourself so you won’t fall asleep. I literally kept falling asleep in the middle of one puzzle last night and I finished it in twice my average completion time. I also didn’t enjoy how small the puzzle pieces became later on as they grew in quantity, because I use a laptop and though I’m not sure what it looks like on a PC screen, I was forcefully squinting by the end. At the end of the day, Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a great addition to any puzzle lover’s game collection and though I was gifted it for free, the cheap $0.69 price tag is quite agreeable.			"

												If you like jigsaw puzzles this is a good game to try.  The music is soothing and the puzzles make lovely pictures.  There are 26 achievements that are fun to get.  It took me almost 20 hours to get them all.      There are three drawbacks.  First there is no save feature.  So you have to complete each puzzle before leaving the game or start over.  Some of the harder puzzles took me a couple hours or so to complete so this was quite annoying.  Second the piece size decreases since they cannot increase the puzzle size.  If you have a small computer screen or poor eyesight this may make things difficult.  Third a few of the puzzles make it hard to pick up the piece you want you have to grab other pieces and move them away from the piece you want in order to grab it.     Even with these drawbacks it is an enjoyable experience and I am glad to have purchased the game.  However waiting for a sale might be a good idea.			"

												6.0/10 - A Good, but Very limited Puzzle Offering!I love puzzles so I had to own at least 1 game of the genre. This one didn't disappoint me either! With that being said I wouldn't pay full price since there are some serious limitations to the game. I picked this up for around $1; I would look to spend no more than $3-4 even if you love puzzles.The puzzles are anywhere from 60-350 pieces; once you start getting into the higher puzzle count it does get quite hard! There are 21 puzzles and 26 achievements to complete. This game will definitely take you longer than 12 hours to complete all puzzles. All of the pieces are floating around the border, so once you get to 350 puzzles you will run into some serious frustration when grabbing a specific piece. I also wasn't thrilled with the puzzle images; they felt very generic. It seems like they went for license free images instead of having amazing pictures to put together. It's worth $2.99-$3.99 based on the length and quality of puzzles. Accidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

												Pixel puzzles: Japan is a nice little game in classic jigsaw puzzle style. That means drag and drop the floating pieces from the water to the playing surface (stone garden). The puzzle pieces differ each round and you will have to do greater puzzles with more pieces. (336 in the end) The games involves some little easter eggs like koi carps in the lake, a waterclock and color change for your playfield.There is also a hint system. If you charge up the ""i-ging"" symbol in the right upper you'll get a complete view of the picture for 10 seconds. The pictures you puzzle are mainly impressions of japanese culture or locations. But the soundtrack was going on my nerves so I turned it off (It's an loop of trembling meditation music). The resolution is fixed on 1280 x 1024 or something and gets upscaled on fullscreen. Unfortunately there is no autosave function that you will loose your progress if you close any puzzle in the middle. But altogether it was relaxing fun for some hours.			"

												After fully completing the game (9 hours for one playthrough), I'm finally reviewing it, and I highly recommend it for anyone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles. I LOVE jigsaws, but find myself unable to partake in many because I have so few flat surfaces around my home, and I also have quite a few cats that are always determined to chew and eat the pieces. Pixel Puzzles allows the player to piece together jigsaws without the hassle.There are a few pros and cons to the game when compared to regular jigsaws that I thought I'd point out. For one, the puzzles are extraordinarily easy for those of us who are used to piecing together 500 or 1000 piece + jigsaw puzzles. Why? The top tier puzzle is, I believe, only 300 pieces, for one thing. Another thing is that the pieces are always rightside up; that is, you never have to turn pieces around clockwise or counter-clockwise to try different sides in different places. When you place a piece in its respective spot, it ""clicks"" into place, which can be seen as a pro and a con. For one thing, that's convenient, but for another, sometimes I would place a piece in about the area I thought it would go, and it would snap into place, taking away the challenge of guesswork, trial and error. There were also a few times I'd grab pieces that were unique to save them for later, only for them to snap into place simply because I'd placed them on the board in just the right place, when I'd had no intention on placing it yet.Many reviews state the lack of a save feature as a flaw, but I had no trouble with this. I'd sit down for an hour and knock a few of them out. I 100% the game without knowing whether or not there was a save feature, since I never needed it. The puzzles have so few pieces even in the top tiers that 45 minutes to an hour is the most you will likely need to set aside. The one flaw that actually DID bother me that others have mentioned is the piece selection. Unused pieces float around the borders of the puzzle area in a pool of water, and they can overlap while floating. If you see a piece you want, it can take a few tries to pick the right one, and this can, admittedly, be infuriating. I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, and one of my ""obsessions"" is that I have to complete the border of a jigsaw puzzle before placing any middle pieces. This one flaw had me reeling quite a few times, because I'd have my eye on a border piece and kept trying incessantly to pick it up, only to pick up dozens of middle pieces in the process. This was pretty time consuming, since I couldn't progress in the puzzle personally until I had the border complete, and this sometimes would take picking up half of the entire puzzle's pieces and setting them aside to accomplish.The last issue with the game is that I couldn't find a way to view what the completed puzzle would look like once I was putting it together. So in the midst of a puzzle, the player can't pick up a piece and check the ""box"", if you will, to guess just about where it will go. In the end, while this is technically an issue, I didn't mind it. It presented a challenge in the game that I enjoyed taking on due to the fact that the game is easier than regular jigsaws.All in all, if you like jigsaws, you will probably enjoy this, and I highly recommend it for those of you who find it hard to make the room for physical jigsaws, as this is the next best thing. While the game is fairly short, I thought it was a great deal as I got it on sale and I ended up paying less than $1.00 per hour of playtime, which is a great value. I highly encourage the developers to consider more pixel puzzle games with other varieties of subject matters, as I'll definitely be supporting future releases.			"

												This is the first game I have achieved 100% achievements in. This should indicate that this is a game where 100%-ing is relatively easy. Overall I would say Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a good relaxing experience under several conditions: 1. You enjoy jigsaw puzzles (surprise!). 2. You like or at least do not mind oriental-themed images (well it says ""JAPAN"" in the title after all). 3. You do not rush yourself (or, in case you are not prepared to alt+tab out of the game at any given time you don't play the last 3-4 levels).Well 1 is pretty much obvious in of itself. Concerning 2 I have to say that the pictures chosen for puzzles (again from the point of view of someone interested in South-East Asia and its beauty) are splendid and wonderful. Looking at them is a pleasure. The accompanying sounds of a water pipe and what does seem to be a shamisen are very helpful in relaxing. They are letting all your troubled minds go away and let you settle down well. The music seems to adapt to your actions and plays more intensively the more pieces you match and the faster you do it. There also some ""interactive"" sounds available for playing with koi or puzzle pieces (in particular, there is a very satisfying sound when the piece touches the sand). The sand color can also be varied to better outline your puzzle pieces.Now it is 3 that I would like to emphasize. The last puzzles are so complex and huge (many small pieces) that, if you are trying to rush yourself through them, (e.g. for the achievements) you might feel a bit frustrated. And the game does not save your progress so your only way of taking breaks is to alt+tab out its window. So do not hurry!More than that there are two additional problems: in the end there are SO many pieces it is quite impossible to fetch the right ones (the ones your see and want to grab) out of your koi pond as they overlap too much and you pretty much have to drag out whatever you can manage to grab with your cursor ""hand"". The last problem I have personally had was a bit subjective (perhaps, people with bigger/better screens would not have it). The very last puzzle had the most pieces and they were so tiny that the ""reflection"" effects, which the game adds on their borders to make the pieces look more volumetric, obscured some of the fine details of the picture (and there were A LOT of fine details there). So in the very very end of the puzzle I basically had to exhaustively try various combinations to fit the pieces in. Again all of the above is NOT a problem, if you take breaks and just chill yourself out to the ambient sounds, enjoy the beautiful views and do not rush yourself forward. If you want easier and more relaxing experience - just play earlier levels again, they provide just that in spades.Overall I DO recommend to try out this game, especially if you see it on sale where it can be really really cheap.

												Didn't like this game.The puzzle pieces don't connect to eachother like in the ancient jigsaw puzzle games that worked on Windows95. Instead, a piece get stuck into place if you put them on the correct spot.Kinda kills the experience, it's not really jigsaw puzzling this way.Hell, even jigsaw puzzle games in windows 3.11 and DOS were able to get that part right.

												Pixel Puzzle franchise.  Recommended for those who literally like to put puzzles together, and I do mean piece by piece.  Pixel Puzzles: Japan Help the monk reach enlightenment by doing the 5 levels of puzzles - 21 puzzles total.  (Poor thing by the end looks like his enlightment made him forget to take a bath.  Just made me chuckle, that is all.)  Level 1: 6 puzzles - 60 pieces.  Level 2: 5 puzzles - 112 pieces. Level 3: 4 puzzles - 153 pieces. Level 4: 3 puzzles - 220 pieces. Level 5: 1 puzzle - 350 pieces, plus 2 bonus puzzles of 350+ pieces.  Extra feature - picture gallery of all puzzles.Each puzzle level becomes progressively ""harder"" 1) due to the amount of pieces and 2) due to the piece shape.  Since there is really no place to sort pieces some creative stacking is required along the puzzle border or on the puzzle board itself. Fortunately once a piece is placed, it stays in place even if by serendipious chance it ends up in the middle of the puzzle board.For me the truest difficultly lie not so much the oddly shaped pieces in some puzzles but fishing the MOVING pieces out of the koi pond.  On two sides of each puzzle board is the koi pond where the pieces float and move along with water lillies and a swimming koi carp fish.  One can be aiming for a certain piece and miss getting that piece repeatedly.  Ah well, creative stacking.  One can even ""play"" with the koi fish.  The fish can be picked up and dropped on the puzzle board.  The fish will then squiggle back to the pond.    The puzzles are iconic pictures from Japan: cherry blossoms, temple gardens, temples, castles, bridges, dragon dog, and even a dragon.  The picture gallery shows all the puzzle pictures.  The music is also iconic traditional Japanese music predominately played in temples.			"

												What is Pixel Puzzles: Japan?Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a game where you have 19 (+2 added for free) jigsaw puzzles to solve. The game is nicely designed in terms of UI graphics, but there are two moments that lead to huge frustration:First, the detection of what puzzle piece you want to take is horrible. So it comes down most of the time to randomly getting a piece, throwing it away, etc, or clearing the route of the piece you want per right-click and hoping you can somehow catch it.Second, some puzzles have too large spaces where absolutely nothing is with the exception of one color. This makes the game coming down to trial and error, clicking through numbers of absolutely identical looking pieces and hoping it fits.Graphics:The graphics itself are nicely done, as I said, but the motifs for the puzzles are sometimes poorly chosen.Music:The music is annoying. One sample sounds like taken from the end of a Settlers 4 tune, together with exactly the same annoying bling sound that makes you think your microwave has finished working / your door has ringed / whatever you have that sounds like it. The sound effects are nothing special as well. I turned it off and heard my MP3s instead.Controls:The game is played entirely with the mouse, but unfortunately it is often impossible to get exactly the puzzle piece you want since - if several are above each other - a certain one is always picked instead of the visible one you click.Conclusion:Overall you get a jigsaw puzzle game that is frustrating after you did half of the puzzles. The achievements are easy to do, however, they just require a lot of time and frustration tolerance. You can expect taking around 12 hours to solve all puzzles, which also gives you almost all achievements. The two you don't have by then are done in seconds and you can find out what to do by their picture.You can find jigsaw puzzle simulators on the internet that are more fun since at least you can pick the pieces you want there. Also don't get confused by the title: Apart from the puzzles showing Japanese scenes, there is nothing about Japanese culture, so this isn't a game for the hardcore Nippon fans either.Recommended:Only if you get it cheap and hunt achievements. Otherwise try some free jigsaw puzzle games on the internet instead! If the controls are ever fixed, you can get it, and the developer still actively patches the game. So please compare this to the actual version (this review was written on 1 September 2014).			"

												There are 19 puzzles in total in total and there is decent amount of playtime here for any jigsaw enthusiast out there. The price is about what i would expect to pay for the advertised features. There are a few shortcomings, however, such as the inability to save your progress during a puzzle which means you need to complete it in one go or start over if you quit out. The developers did stated that in puzzle saving is a feature they plan on adding in an update but for now we have to make do with it. Pixel Puzzles: Japan is certainly not the best but also not too shabby either.			"

												Weirdly enough, I was convinced to have reviewed the game on Steam. Well, it seems that only my website got the privilege. I'm repairing the error now.Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a game where you have to rebuild an image which is a Japanese landscape. Each time the puzzle is completed, you unlock new ones, with more pieces (it can go over 300!). The pieces are floating in the pond, with a koi wandering around. Some of them hide a bonus that, once completed, can be used though I don't remember what it's doing - if I have it used at all. I was more focused on rebuilding a castle or a monastery or a park than worrying about it.Each puzzle shape are special: you can have arrows for example. As you don't know what's the image looks like (I suppose that the bonus is about showing for a few seconds the whole picture), you have to relay on the nuances of the color.As it's the first game in the series, there are negative points: taking the pieces isn't easy. Indeed, you want to take one but you're ending up with the one that was passing under it or around it. It lacks also of a saving feature: if you have to interrupt your game, you will have to redo the puzzle from the beginning. And as some can take hours to finish, you bet that it would be nice to save it and come back later.The game is still a very good, with beautiful landscapes and with a good challenge provided.			"

												Nice jigsaw puzzle game, that reminds me of puzzles from my childhood. The theme is as title says, Japan and various famous places from there. Actually it's fun to play, you pick one of available puzzles, as your character - Monk gets older while meditates and that lets you play more difficult levels. Puzzles are varied in themes and depicted beautifully, settings are right below the screen and allow to change color of backround or volume of music quickly. Nevertheless, in the middle of campaign some awful things start to interfere, like same music over and over or problem to pick a specific part from plenty of others floating around. These problems show up and bother only later in game and, also, who decided to make later puzzles 1-2 hours long each, without feature to save? It really kills the point of this game, which should be some quick, casual gaming when you are tired from bigger games.At the end, it's an enough enjoyable jigsaw puzzle game and even boring later stages and other problems should not stop you from trying it, especially when Steam lacks these type of games.

												This is straightforward Jigsaw Puzzle solving game. The game would appeal to just about anyone, the puzzles increase in difficulty, but in the type of difficulty that larger-piece-puzzle brings. It's actually pretty relaxing.  There's no penalty for putting a piece in the wrong place, and when you do find the right place, it snaps & can't be moved anymore. No time limits, just some jigsaw-solving goodness.  Great deal for the price.My only ""con"" is that the sound is so distracting that I had to turn it off. When you turn the volume to the lowest setting, it's still pretty loud, and the bamboo thing makes me violently angry after awhile. Kinda ruins the calm mood it puts you in.EDITED TO ADD 5/21/14: A patch was put in today where you can pick up the koi and put it into the bamboo, thus silencing it. Hurrah!A random side note, I enjoyed that not all the puzzles were in the traditional jigsaw shape, it was a fun change.  I just wish there were more puzzles. :(			"

												I used to do a lot of jigsaw puzzles, back before the internet made all other forms of amusement obsolete, so when I got Pixel Puzzles: Japan in a bundle, I gave it a try.  I breezed through the first puzzle, earning an achievement to boot, and moved on to the next.  I finished that one and got an achievement.  I did three more puzzles, getting an achievement for each one, and an achievement for completing five puzzles.  As I continued, the puzzles began to have more pieces, and I kept going, puzzle, achievement, puzzle, achievement, extra achievement...  There was vaguely Asian flute music playing in the background, the sort of thing you might play when trying to convince someone to eat raw fish.  The hypnotic music and the floating puzzle pieces began to put me into a trance, which earned me another achievement.  I began having visions of places I have never been, places I never want to go.  I clicked on a fish.  Got an achievement for it.  Everything faded away, my conciousness drifting into the universe.  The phone rang, and reality came crashing back upon me like a tsunami, earning me the final achievement.  Overall, not a bad puzzle game, the click detection is horrid though.  If you do play, I suggest doing the outside edges first, that way all you have left is inner piece.			"

PIXEL PUZZLE JAPAN✓ I just started playing this game and although classic puzzle games aren't my taste at all, sometimes it's a variety to some gamers playing classic games like this. ✓ It's a very relaxed puzzle game with no pressure at all. There is no time limit or any other reason to stress yourself. ✓ It's really relieving to enjoy the relaxing and calm asian music in the background while putting some jigsaw pieces (with unusual edges) together into an one big beautiful picture from japan. ✓ There are plenty of nice pictures and the floating jigsaw  pieces are funny to watch, especially when you catch the fish by accident instead of a piece. ✓ If you have troubles to put them together you can collect some kind of points ( by previous put pieces) and use them at a certain amount to see the full picture for a short time of period which might help a bit.✓ My advice to you is starting with the edges of the entire puzzle and then compare the patterns especially the colours to find easier matches.ALL IN ONE ✓ This game is recommendable for gamers who want to get rid of their daily stress and want to try out this classic puzzle game and waste a bit time, although i felt like i never really wasted time because it was really relieving & relaxing at the same time.*IMPORTANT NOTE*: This game is currently for free on the Indiegala Website so grab it today and don't miss your chance ( Date : 12.03.2015)			"

												So it's a jigsaw puzzle game with pictures of famous Japanese tourist spots and attractions like Himeji Castle, Osaka Castle, the gardens of Nijo Castle, and more. Controls are pretty self-explanatory, click and hold the left mouse button to drag pieces around and if you want to remove a non-locked piece from the field, you press the right mouse button. Fairly simple premise, but I mean, it's a jigsaw puzzle game, it shouldn't be that difficult. What's annoying about this game is how the pieces behave when they're not on the playing field.All of the pieces of the puzzle inhabit the border surrounding the upper and left sides of the frame, and these pieces don't stand still. Instead they're like little cardboard pieces continuously floating in any random direction while in a body of water. And it's really annoying when there's over 200 pieces in the puzzle and each individual piece is tiny. You can click and drag away the pieces you don't need and they'll teleport to another part of the frame. There's no ""safe spot"" aside from within the puzzle frame to store pieces for later and again, when there's over 200 pieces to work with, it's hard to keep track of some pieces and knowing whether you'll need that piece now or later. Another minor problem with this game is the lack of a save feature. What if I don't want to do the last 350 piece puzzle all in one sitting? I guess I would walk away from the computer, but what if I want to stop and play another game on Steam? It doesn't matter if I've just put down the first five pieces or I've finished a quarter of the puzzle because I have to decide if I want to see that puzzle to the end or completely drop my progress and start fresh the next time I start up PPJ. It's a minor annoyance, more so for the later puzzles. Some other small nitpicks...There's a restart button and a home button that's very close to the bottom of the frame of the puzzle. I've never accidentally hit either of these buttons while doing a puzzle, but basically...there's no prompt. If you hit the reset button, the entire puzzle resets. If you hit the home button, the game takes you right back to the main menu. A prompt would have been nice. There's also no real reference of the picture of the puzzle that you're trying to complete. Every now and again after you correctly place a piece down on the puzzle you can fill this powerup that lets you see the completed picture for a few seconds, but I've rarely been able to take advantage of this ability. The only time I really, absolutely needed it was for the last (non-bonus) puzzle. I'm still going to recommend this game though. It's a pretty good substitute if you're like me and want to play with jigsaw puzzles but lack the surface area in real life to devote your time to a 1000 piece puzzle.			"

												The pieces are constantly moving in a river, and you can't leave in the middle of a puzzle and come back. Clicking on the specific piece you want from the river never works - direct clicks on an edge piece were not registering, instead picking up adjacent floating pieces. Far too frustrating.			"

												This game is so close to being really good that I can't really reccomend it. If it were a bit worse I would. Its ALMOST great...The first puzzles are fun and entertaining but as the piece count goes up they get annoyingly hard but not because of the puzzles. The UI is difficult and frustrating on large puzzles.I have completed all of the available puzzles and if you like puzzles and don't mind being patient trying to find your pieces I will say this game is worth buying on sale. If you get frustrated when a game doesnt do what you tell it to? avoid this game for now.- No subassemblies.     Pieces will only lock in place when put on the right spot in the board and must be moved one at a time until then.- Difficult to grab the piece you see.      The stream is unique and enjoyable until it is so full you can't grab the piece you see. The tip of the pointer doesnt matter. The game will simply choose a piece thats under your cursor which can be any of 20 at a moment. You can right click to clear an area and pick out the ones you want as they come into this spot but that means sending all the others back to the start... very frustrating. I started just making piles of my ""discard"" pieces to clear the stream.- No zoom. (nice to have but not game breaking)     I have a smaller display on my notebook and often had to get too close to my screen to make out details. I got a bit of a headache when I tried to play for too long although it was probably from the piece selection issue more than finding the piece I wanted. I think a wider stream with scroll wheel to zoom and screen edges to pan would help a lot and we could have enjoyable puzzles at 1000+ pieces.-No work space.   There is nowhere to place pieces other than within the frame of the puzzle or they fall back into the stream. It woudl be nice if we could pile up extra pieces on the right hand side where the monk is.I would love to see more puzzles released for this game. I would even buy some DLC if the devs do something to make the UI a bit more usable at larger sizes. Its great to have puzzles that are challenging but it should be the puzzle that creates the challenge not the interface.			"

												Friggin' Jigsaw Puzzles man, what'cha got to say about 'em? Ya got a million pieces and you gotta put 'em back together, simple as that.Pixel puzzles Japan does a good job at recreating the experience of a jigsaw puzzle, not that that's entirely difficult, but it's still a rather enjoyable experience. The core of the game, other than just putting puzzles together, is to complete a number of puzzles that picture Japanese landscapes and structures so that your monk dude evolves or something into a better monk, and you unlock more puzzles. There are six 60 pieces puzzles that you start out with before eventually unlocking five 112 piece puzzles, four 153 piece puzzles, three 220 piece puzzles, and finally one 350 piece puzzle. After some updates, the game also has two extra 220 piece puzzles that you can put together at any time.There's an options menu, because that's the most important thing about this game:/s:, where there's two volume sliders for music and SFX, along with toggles for V-Sync, HD-Mode (Whatever that is), and fullscreen (Which can also freely be toggled during a puzzle). What a time to be a PC gamer amirite? Other options that can be seen when working on a puzzle is the ability to change music tracks (Though I never found it too useful, there's not a whole lot of music and a few of the tracks are simple 3-second shamisen riffs or something), and the ability to change the color of the sand behind the puzzle pieces, which I can only assume is there purely for asthetic purposes.Anyway, the puzzles themselves! It's mainly just what you think it is, you put pieces together to eventually form a complete picture. There are some advantages to it being a video game and not a physical puzzle though, such as the inability to lose/destroy pieces. All puzzles are also cut into abstract shapes unique to the puzzle you're working on, like pagoda or tree shaped indents; it's pretty cool and give some character to the puzzle. Most significantly though is ""Power of the I-Ching"" feature: Around the board will be hidden yin-yangs that you collect when you put down a piece; collect eight of them and you can activate the Power of I-Ching to see the complete picture for a brief period of time, helping you get some particularly tricky pieces into place; you can do this multiple times depending on how many yin-yangs you collect. You don't have to use it though, and you can activate it any time after you collect eight yin-yangs.That's about where it ends though, other than that it's just a bunch of puzzles with calming, unintrusive Japanese music playing over them. I found it very relaxing, and I did eventually make my way through all the puzzles.BUT!That doesn't mean there aren't any problems with this game! Infact, it has quite a few simple, yet glaring, problems that make the game harder than it needs to be.First of all, every piece that makes up the puzzle will be floating in a koi pond near the side of the board. They all just kinda slowly drift into and bump off of walls until you pick them up and put them on the board. It's a nice effect, but hot dayum does it cause problems down the line. Each piece has a HUGE hitbox, so lets say you finally found a piece you've been scouting out for, and when you go to click on it, you pick up 37 1/2 of the other pieces before you finally get the one you wanted if you didn't lose it in a sea of virtual cardboard picture fagments. On top of that, when you drop a piece into the pond, it teleports it and every piece around it to a set ""Spawn point"" (I'm fairly certain this is because letting go of the left mouse button drops a piece, but instead of coding the game to simply drop the piece, it right clicks where you dropped it (Right-clicking sends every piece you click on back to the ""Spawn point"")). So if you're rapidly picking up pieces you don't want and dropping them carelessly, you can end up teleporting the piece you want back to a cloud of other puzzle pieces.Oh, and remember how I said you can't lose pieces?http://i.imgur.com/6PlRXhI.gifSince pieces on the board aren't highlighted, or don't highlight themselves when you mouse over them, I've had multiple occasions where I'm about to finish a puzzle or a section of the puzzle, only to lose last piece I needed because it decided it's goal in life was to turn into a chameleon and hide among the completed puzzle. Maybe it's just me, but that usually got me stuck for a few minutes, especially since there's no button to send every unplaced piece back to the pond, just one to reset the whole puzzle.But those can be seen as simple coding oversights or something. While I think those are due for some fixing, the true crime is that you can't save your progress! Once again, this doesn't entirely matter on the easier puzzles, you'll complete them within ten, maybe fifteen minutes. But as you go on, puzzles can take almost an hour to complete; the final 350 piece puzzle took me over an hour and a half! You'll have to sit there until that puzzle's completed, or you'll have to window the game and let it run behind other things you're doing. That's dumb, why in the world is that a thing? Even with the Power of I-Ching, many pieces are so small that they'll be a solid color that belongs in a much larger blotch of that color, meaning I-Ching is powerless when it comes to anything near a couple hundred pieces.However, in spite of these issues, I did manage to complete all of the puzzles the game had to offer. I would suggest to the devs at Decaying Logic try to fix these problems, considering that this is only one in a series of, currently, four jigsaw puzzle games they've created, all of which probably have the same problems (Not that I'd know yet). All in all, I'd say it's a rather promising game if you're into Jigsaw puzzles, or need something to kill some time, or maybe you're grandmother has a Steam account, I dunno. The game is seven dollars, however, and I'm not sure I could reccomend full price. Maybe if it goes at a 50% discount?I guess it's also got trading cards.This is all, of course, my humble opinion in the end. Cross-reference mine with others and determine if this is a game for you.Bottom Line: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a game to get if you're a casual. Or not, who the hell and I to know? Probably better than Angry birds.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------			"

												If you love puzzles, japanese gardens and a casual game that instantly puts you into a relaxed mood, this is for you!The different motives and tile shapes are beautiful and creative. When you put a piece on the right spot it locks in place - which makes it so much easier overall. Sometimes it's a bit tricky to chose a certain piece because they all float in a water basin. So it can be better to just deal with the piece you happen to pick. One by one. Being able to change the background colour is quite useful!			"

												Who knew you could so easily screw up something as simple as a digital puzzle, but here we are:Grating, annoying ""music"". You can mute it but more effort would have been nice in this area given how simple this product is and the price they're asking for it. I mean, it's a digital puzzle, you kind of expect appropriate and decent music to go with it. The puzzle pieces float along the side of the puzzle mat, makes sense right? In theory it's supposed to make your life easier so you don't have to manually sift through the pieces. Well, that would be all well and good if it didn't invariably almost always take every piece except the exact one you're trying to use... I can't even call it a misclick because it isn't. It's bad design and programming. The piece is on top of all others, no pieces next to it, the mouse is exactly on top and yet it doesn't grab the piece. You can't piece together pieces along the way. So, you either explicitly find the place for ONE piece on the puzzle mat or you don't put any pieces together at all. Free games on Pogo let you piece along the way for crying out loud.I mean, if this was a buck, I could overlook these idiotic flaws but as it stands, yes the product delivers but it's far too annoying and frustrating for the price.I don't even think I'd pay ten cents for this nonsense the way its currently implemented.

												For a game that is supposed to be Zen and relaxing, this can get pretty frustrating. Worse is that this could have been easily avoided. The puzzle pieces, when not on the board, float around. On top and under one another. When you see a piece you want to pick up, it will grab every single other piece first, and by the time you've cleared out all the pieces around it, it has moved under a new bunch and you have to continue on clicking pieces you don't want. This is NOT an exaggeration. And it doesn't matter if it's at the very top of all the other pieces. I clicked over 40 pieces (I counted) before finally picking up the one I wanted. This, coupled with the fact that two pieces will not stick to one another (as they would in real life) unless they are in their final position, makes it very annoying to put pieces together just to move them again one by one when you find where they're supposed to go. Fix these two things, and it'll be the perfect jigsaw puzzle game. Currently, I cannot recommend.			"

												PROS:*Decent variety of piece shapesCONS:*In later puzzles, it is often difficult to pick specific pieces out of the pool that surrounds the puzzle, as other pieces get in the way*Dropping a piece back in the pool makes it and the pieces around it respawn in a specific location on the left side*No good space to organize pieces*Pieces only lock into their precise position within the frame, which means that the player cannot connect individual pieces before he knows where they will go*The puzzle image is not available except through the game's hint system, which ""charges"" when the player correctly places randomly chosen pieces*Puzzle image variety is mediocre to poor in the Japan edition and some images consist of much of the same color, which makes for boring pictures and tedious puzzle solving*Repetitive music*Too few puzzles even for $7, especially given their size range (60 to 250 pieces)GAME LENGTH:7-10 hours, depending on one's skill at solving jigsaw puzzles.  I took a little over 8 hours, including some idle time.SCORE:3 out of 10Solving the puzzles in this game is too different from solving actual jigsaw puzzles.  Physical puzzles nearly universally come in boxes with a picture on the front, which is commonly used as a reference point.  I do not think that being able to see what one is putting together should be regarded as a hint, especially for pictures like these.  In any case, some of the fun of solving a puzzle is lost for me when I don't have the opportunity to pick up a piece and scan the image for its position.  Additionally, without any devoted space for organizing pieces or assembling different sections of the puzzle, the process is much slower.And it should go without saying that, in a game where the player must pick up pieces and place them in specific positions, the player ought to be able to actually pick up the piece that he wants.For being frustrating, boring, and inferior in almost every way to normal jigsaw puzzles, I give this a 3 out of 10.Note:  The same criticisms hold true of the Undead edition, with the exception of the lack of image variety.  However, the Undead edition also adds an unnecessary (and tedious, though easy) zombie defense minigame to every puzzle, so overall it is just as bad.			"

												NOTE: This review was made for this game when it was 75% off. Consider the conclusion pf this review if you are thinking of buying it for the full price.First, let me say this; I am extremely addicted to all kinds of jigsaw puzzles. I have completed at least 50 different jigsaw puzzles which have 1000+ pieces, including the former world record 24,000 piece puzzle. I have played endless amount of different jigsaw puzzle Flash games I've found on the internet. I often see myself doing jigsaw puzzles in my dreams. Hell, while trying to fall asleep, eyes closed, I see myself connecting puzzle pieces.So, using my experience as a source of opinion, what I think the game is:Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a jigsaw puzzle game which1) does NOT let you connect pieces with each other, instead you have to connect the pieces to the field2) the playing field has the exact same size as the puzzle itself, so you have no extra space and the field can get crowded quite fast3) does NOT let you rotate the pieces, which in my opinion, takes away quite a lot of fun4) has the pieces floating around in a tub, causing the player to pick up the wrong one even if youdid not misclick (when pieces are stacked it does not always take the piece from the top layer) 5) has an extremely ridiculous storyline and not in a good way.6) is not much better than some of the free Flash jigsaw puzzle games found onlineSo why do I still recomment it? Because (besides the fact that I'M ADDICTED TO THESE TYPES OF GAMES; SEND HELP), the theme of the game is relaxing, all the pictures are spectacular and tolerable to put together. I myself prefer to hear my own playlists, but as much as I've listened to the game sound it is calming and when the game starts to frustrate me, the audio helps me chill down. And I'm not sure why, but if a game has achivements I immideatly consider buying it, so if you're into that one can get quite a fast 100%, if they have some nerve.All in all, this game has a common playstyle like most of the Flash games found online, that are free, but what makes it stand out is the atmosphere of the game. For the full price I would not recommend this game since you can take any free game found online and listen to some Zen music on the background and get pretty much the same feeling, but 2€ is not that much for the actual feeling. I do not regret my decision of buying this game.			"

												In the immortal words of IGN ""Like Skyrim with puzzles"". But seriously now, it's freaking awesome. I mean who doesn't like a good jigsaw puzzle? This is just it, only in digital edition. As the title says, this is about Japan so you get pictures of various motives and places from Japan to puzzle out. On one side this is somewhat easier than normal jigsaw since you can get lucky and randomly hit the right place for your piece which is then locked there. On the other, this adds another dimension to normal game by having you pick floating pieces of the puzzle from the water. With that we get to the only real problem the game has. Said picking of the floating pieces flat-out sucks in the latter puzzles. You will see the piece you want, you will click on it, and you'll get another, seemingly random, piece. It's a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ I got around it by moving some of the pieces to the table, that reduces the number of them in the water which then pretty much solves the problem. Of course it's not perfect since you'll then have a mess on the table but it worked for me. That said i was afraid when i got to the last picture, which is a behemoth of the 350 pieces, that i will never solve it due to the picking shenanigans but for some reason it worked perfectly there. How that is even possible is beyond me.All in all i had a great 10 hours with it, even if it was frustrating at times, and i will gladly recommend it to anyone.  Especially if you can get in on a discount for a buck or two.			"

The music is quite nice if you like this type of music. It really makes it more into the context of Japan (for those who doesn´t like this type of music, you can change between songs, and/or you can turn it off)The puzzles are very beautiful so it makes you want to finish it to see the whole picture!In addition you have steam game cards! So it´s awesome for the price it is right now :)If you like puzzles, and you like Japan or you like beautiful pictures, then this is your game! Go for it you won´t regret!			"

												     There are currently 21 puzzles, the music is enjoyable as are many of the effects, such as the flowing tray. I do enjoy the various piece shapes especially in the first column like the trees or the pagodas.       However the main down sides are: 1)no save feature while in progress, 2) As the pieces become progressively smaller you see less detail. 3) While making the pieces in the tray float back and forth is pleasing visually it becomes an annoyance when you can not grab the piece you want because another piece either gets in the way or the piece is so small and the tray so crowded you grab another piece by mistake.     Overall I'll give this a 6/10, it shows a lot of promise but still needs some work.  If your a puzzle enthusiast give it a go, but for more casual puzzlers stick to the first column or two.			"

												If you like Japanese-themed jigsaw puzzles. This is the game for you! The audio gets annoying after a while but you can just mute the game. Because it all has to fit on your screen, the pool of puzzle pieces can compact them at times, which makes it hard to find the piece you're looking for. Easy 100%6/10 Sakura Trees			"

OverviewPixel Puzzles Japan is a fairly basic puzzle game with varying difficulties, with themes from - obviously - Japan. While the game has a very nice atmosphere and can get you entertained enough to complete them all, there are some issues I still have. Alas, cons aside, this is a nice game if you can get it for dirt cheap if you're into Jigsaw puzzles. I am giving this a positive review, but I am on the very edge between decent and... not worthy. I will explain why.The Pros:  Great Ambience  - Puzzle aside, the game does a decent job of putting you in the role of a monk who does zen stuff like this all day long. Your pieces are placed in a water pool alongside a fish, you have a nice water timer and also the music is pretty relaxing.  Diverse Edges  - Almost every puzzle has different gaps on the edges, so you actually feel like playing a new game everytime you play, and not just switch to another picture. These also change the difficulty, as having to squint your eyes to observe the ones with more bumps and holes isn't that comfortable as plain, big, single extrusions.  20 Puzzles, 6 Settings  - 20 puzzles, getting increasingly difficult, and having more pieces. From 60 all the way up to 240+  Easy Achievements  - Even though this doesn't affect my general score of games, this is usually a point that I make every time I review a game. This games achievements are earned purely by completing the game. Great for achievement hunters who love to flaunt that ""Perfect Games"" counter on their profile.The Cons: Bad User Interface - Even though the menu says 1080p, the general textures of things look really blurry and upscaled. Also, the buttons are aesthetically not pleasing. Won't bug you from completing puzzles, but for a game so easy to make, I would have expected more when it comes to such a basic aspect. Piece Selection Flaw - The game can be very anoying. I mean VERY anoying when you want to get a specific puzzle piece you see in the pool. Even if you click exactly on it, you will most probably end up pickung another one, as the game chooses to automatically choose the first piece in the placement sequence, if you go from top-bottom and left-right. This leads, besides the annoyance of having to dig through the pieces before getting the one you want, also is the mother of a very useful exploit, that makes any puzzle, no matter how big, so easy to solve it takes NO skill. You can easily find out about this in the Community Guides.ConclusionIs this game worth it? Mabye. It was pretty satisfactory to complete the puzzles, although the cons I've presented are some pretty serious ones, and I wouldn't reccomend paying the full price for this game. I had the chance to snatch it for free in a mass giveaway, and given it was free, I really enjoyed it. If you like it, grab it while on sale. Full price not worth it, at least not without a potential update.If you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

												The game doesnt really do anything to use the fact its puzzles GAME on  pc, its basically normal puzzles but virtual. Kinda waste of potential here, but it would have been fine, if only the interface was good. The whole idea of puzzles swimming in a pond might have worked, if the controls actually worked properly, it's fine untill you get to the puzzles with more pieces when it becomes a nightmare trying to get the piece you actually want to pick from the pond. The pieces stack on top of each other, with no way to tell which one is actually on top, you would think the one that appears on top would be the one you pick after clicking it, it doesn't happen. While it works like that on board, the pond seems to be completely random.The hitboxes of pieces dont' match their shape, and are larger than the piece, almost impossible to take one if its covered, even if only half, without digging through all the pieces on top. Also, sometimes instead of picking one piece game randomly decides that you surely wanted to pick all of them in the cursor area and resets them all to the pool.TL;DR Standard puzzles, nothing fancy, except rage inducing controls. You find yourself struggling to pick that piece you want, instead of figuring  out the puzzles.			"

												This is the first puzzle game I bought on steam. I bought it when it was on a 90% sale and it gave me around 11 hours of gameplay (without repetition). What I like about this game is that the difficulty increases as you do the set of 20 puzzles. There is however one very frustrating outlier - puzzle nr 12. Across the levels, the puzzles pieces vary in their shapes (e.g. some have ""spears"" poking out, others are curved) which keeps them interesting. I like the Japanese music and theme and I absolutely love that you, the monk, grow a beard and your hair turns grey the further you get into this game. Now with all of this being said there are 2 big issues with this game. First of all, there is no save feature! I had to leave my computer running overnight to complete a puzzle, because I simply didn't have 2-3 hours straight (and patience) to complete it. Secondly, the puzzle pieces keep moving on your screen, meaning that you will end up picking up the same piece a dozen of times, without wanting to do so, simply because it's on top of others/in the way. All in all, I would recommend grabbing this game when it's on sale and if the negative aspects don't bother you.			"

The game features a jigsaw selecting screen with 19 puzzles in a range of sizes from 60 to 350 pieces. You'll relax yourself for more than 6 hours listening to the music and taking your time to finish each puzzle. You'll hear or not (depends on you) the Japanese bamboo after it delivers the water.While doing a puzzle, you'll have the same river in the upper and left hand corner where each piece is rocked by the water. You may experience some issue while trying to catch the piece you want, please read carefully the (#) point at the end. If you place the jigsaw piece at the right spot, the piece will be stuck. Also when you placed enough pieces, you'll unlock an enlightenment mode which can be used to reveal the finished puzzle on the background for limited amount of time. One last thing about the gameplay is you can change the background color at any time and it can be easier that way to find a lost one.For the achievements you'll mostly need to finish all puzzles of the games excluding some extra one. You'll also need to interact with the environment for some of them.(#) :As I said a little about it, it can be frustrating while selecting the piece you want in the river. So you need to learn the ""trick"", you need to click on the right spot. If I remember you need to do it at the edge or in the corner. Also when you release a piece on the water, be sure to release it away from any piece you want. When you do it will shatter all the pieces around it away.Finally I can say that this game is quite good : it represents many aspects of the Japanese culture.			"

Pixel Puzzles : Japan is a good game, lovely pictures waiting for to be filled with puzzle pieces, while our character is gaining mighty powers with each success.So the graphics is good enough for a casual game, but the music is very poor. Perhaps because i've been expecting for some Kyodai Mahjongg-like melodies, so i rather used my own Metal albums along with it.Overall is a good fun is you have some free time and money to spend.

												If I could remove games from my Steam, this would be one of them. Jesus Christ, this game is disorienting as all hell. Puzzle pieces fly all over the place, and when you try to grab them, you grab one that is in the area and 9 out of 10 times not the piece you want. Sure, the puzzles might be looking good, but I'm not going to spend minutes just trying to grab a piece I need.Even if you love Jigsaw Puzzles (I know I do), stay away from this game. If the puzzle pieces didn't fly around all the time, a lot of the problems I have with this game would be fixed and I would actually put up a positive review here.			"

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is exactly what you're getting when you buy this title. All the puzzles are literally jigsaw puzzles with pieces cut into some fun shapes and with pictures of things most people would say are indeed purely Japanese. The interactive play area is pretty unique though, where the pieces for the puzzles are floating around constantly in the area around the building plot, which makes the game quite a bit more difficult. Overall, with achievements added and how long it's going to take you to finish some of these harder puzzles as you go through the levels, this game is worth its price. (But please, please, add a save-game feature to save your progress on a puzzle! That is truly all this game needs to be complete, if you ask me.)			"

												I'm not a big fan of jigsaw puzzles because I don't have patience for them, but this one was... relaxing. I also noticed an exploit: if you stack all the pieces on top of each other except for the edge pieces, then place all the edge pieces and start taking the other pieces out of the pile, they come out in an almost perfect sequence, making it extremely easier to solve the puzzle. Not a very good game design. One thing that bothered me though: I almost never got the piece I wanted while I was fishing, it would give me a completely different piece most of the time.			"

Nothing awaits you in the side pool but frustration and regret, and in this scenario you can't even fling the pieces on the floor to vent your indignation.			"

""Oh? You wanted this piece? No? How about this one? No again? Which piece, please be more specific. This one? Here you go. No? What do you want from me?!"" Cue the facepalm.---------------------------------------------------------Pixel Puzzles: Japan offers a casual, calm, and relaxing (most of the time) setting where, if you hadn't realised by now, you piece together a jigsaw puzzle. Sounds simple enough... but wait, there's more! This is where the relaxation part tends to ends: the floating pieces. These pieces have no sympathy for your tears or cries of frustration, they will float and evade your mouse pointer to their hearts content. Confused by what I mean? Well, check out the game trailer to see!Anyways, let me do a breakdown for you.---------------------------------------------------------Pros+ Various difficulty levels makes it a decent challenge on some of the jigsaws+ Easy game to load up and play casually; play it in small doses however... I'll elaborate in the con+ Achievements are very easy to pick up and should be of no trouble. Easily collectable as you complete each level+ Some of the puzzles are absolutely gorgeous - they range from realistic pieces to cartoonish paintings, but really offers a glimpse into the culture and life of the Japanese peopleNeutral± Some of the puzzles were hard to piece together, but if you work outside-in, then you'll definitely be able to solve it± There were times when I enjoyed the soundtrack and sound effects, but I ended up turning off the soundtrack because it became too repetitive. The sound effects were fine thoughCons- There is no save feature, which is horrid, so make sure you play this game when you have nothing else to do. Otherwise just keep your computer turned on. I made the mistake of thinking there was an automatic save feature -  a gaming derp moment - and ""x'ed"" out of the game. Waves of regret flooded the gates- I would not suggest getting this game at its $6,99 asking price. Instead, I would suggest $1,99-2,99 as more appropriate. While it is a good game, it has been bundled and been given away for free many times. Its lowest price has also been $0,69 on Steam, so you're better off waiting for a sale. At the end of the day, I spent 6 hours in order to complete the game, and the rest was spent idling for cards- One of the most frustrating aspects of this game - and why I say ""play it in small doses"" - is the ""pick up"" feature. You're eyeing a piece that you need, honing in on it, and them ""bam!"" You end up picking up another piece. So you drop that unwanted one and try again. *Click!* You pick up another piece. Then you sit there madly clicking until you finally get the piece, but in frustration you let it go and it DISAPPEARS. I don't know how many times I ended up seething and mumbling under my breath and had my friends ask me why I'm getting so mad over a puzzle game. They just don't understand...---------------------------------------------------------Puzzle games are always good fun, but beware of the slight issues that plague Pixel Puzzles: Japan. While I enjoyed the game enough to complete it, I wouldn't consider ever opening it up again just because of the small agitating features.Play it sparsely or splurge if you would like to instead; definitely not the best jigsaw game, but also not the worst.Overall5.5/10---------------------------------------------------------Like my review or have any questions? Then please consider joining my review group, the Sonny Report! I will keep it up to date with the games that I plan on reviewing and will also accept suggestions.			"

												For the most part, ""PIxel Puzzles:  Japan"" is a really nice game.  The pictures are nice, the puzzles are fun to do, and the interface is fairly good (the flowing stream of pieces is pretty good at letting you see all the pieces over time and you don't have to rotate pieces to fit them in).  There are some problems with it, though:- The big problem is that you can't save your game mid-puzzle.  For the smaller puzzles, that's not an issue.  But, for the later ones, you're spending several hours doing the puzzles and can't quit the game without losing your progress on that puzzle.- The next biggest problem is that as you advance to the higher-piece puzzles, it gets harder and harder to actually pick up the pieces you're pointing at (oddly, in the puzzle with the greatest number of pieces, that problem went away -- I have no idea why).  I'd like to see the algorithm they use since it must do something like pick up every piece except the one that's being clicked on).- Again, as you move up to the higher-piece puzzles (starting at the 153 piece ones), it starts to get difficult to see the pieces -- they're too small.- There needs to be a pond or something where you can place pieces you've pulled from the stream.  It would also be nice if we could place pieces together in that pond and have them stick together for later placement as a unit.- There's a ""reset puzzle"" stone right in the middle of the bottom margin.  It doesn't confirm that you want to reset the puzzle.  It just does it.  I lost a couple of hours of play with that once.  Also, I fail to see the use of such a button.  Why would I ever want to reset the puzzle?- In the options, the sound level doesn't stick across sessions.  That means you have to reset it every time you fire up the game.But, even with those problems, the game is worth it.  Recommended.			"

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan enjoyable jigsaw puzzle game if you've the time and patience to play it.I've found game most enjoyable to play but it certainly can get frustrating. What frustrating is that the moving puzzles tends overlap each other which makes it hard to grab the puzzle piece that I want. As the game progresses, the jigsaw puzzles get even more challenging to complete, due to having many puzzle pieces floating around in the water; hence why I said 'time and patience' to play the game.The achievements for this game isn't that hard to obtain at all. They are obtained by completing each of the jigsaw puzzles.  Nineteen achievements for nineteen jigsaw puzzles. There are other achievements that are linked in completing the puzzles. Like for example: Completing ""X"" amount jigsaw puzzles earns you an enlightenment achievement rank.The music is relaxing but it can get very repetitious for certain extended period. It can be turned down in the game's option menu but the setting isn't saved at all for the next time. Remedy for this problem is to turn down the volume on ones' own computer.If you look beyond the frustration that comes with this jigsaw puzzle game it can be relaxing and enjoyable to the very end.

												It's been a while I haven't played jigsaw puzzle.Bring back memories of my childhood.So here is the review...It's just like any jigsaw puzzle out there.The images are about places in Japan.In game, you can only see the whole picture when the yin yang is full. Click it and the complete image is visible for a while.Other than that, you can see the all pictures in ""EXTRAS"" menu. I screenshoted some of it before played it lol.Pros :It has trading card.It has easy achievements. Complete all levels will unlock 24/26 achievements. The rest 2 achievements are just do something about the koi fish. That's it.Nice UI.Funny interaction with the fish.Cons :Hard to pick the pieces. Eventhough the pieces is on top, the game will select another piece. Moreover, the pieces are floating on the pond moving around makes it harder to pick what you want. But the last level (level 5), the pieces is somehow easy to pick. I always got the pieces I want.The puzzle progress can't be saved until finished. Back to menu or quit game while in the middle of puzzle won't be saved and have to restart the puzzle again. I closed the game because I had something to do, and when I started it again, my progress of that puzzle is lost. Had to start over again. "

												If you like puzzles then you will like this game! As the name itself says it has Japanese themed pictures and music to fit the atmosphere as you solve one of nineteen puzzles varying from 60 to 350 pieces per puzzle. As you solve puzzles you also absorb powers that can help you give insight into the puzzle you are solving. Atmosphere is also relaxing and you can simply rest your mind playing this game.It has achievements, card drops and is simple and epic!I highly recommend this game to anyone who likes puzzles or a simple game to just chill out when you have nothing else to play. It was free when I got it but even on sale or in bundles it's really worth getting it!8/10			"

												Ugh, this is possibly the worst jigsaw game I've played in terms of the basic features.* Pieces don't connect to themselves. They only magically snap into place if you put them in the correct spot on the board, even if there is nothing next to them.* No advanced controls like the ability to move multiple pieces at once.* The pond of floating pieces is a clever idea executed very poorly. The piece you click on is often not the one that gets picked up. Discarded pieces always start in one spot in the pond, so that part of the pond is always too crowded.* No apparent way to see the full picture.* No difficulty options as far as I can see (cut type, count, rotation, etc) - one cut/count per puzzle, and you have to advance in the specific way that the game wants you to.* No save feature. If you start a tough puzzle, you have to do it all at once.* No timing/clock features of any kind.Graphics, art, music, sound in general is pretty dorky and mediocre.Still room for a decent jigsaw puzzle game on Steam. This one doesn't cut it. There are free web jigsaw games that are much better than this.On the up side, this has cards and achievements...			"

												Everything about this game is good except for one thing, but that one thing is so irritating that it spoils the game and means I can't recommend it:When you click on a jigsaw piece to pick it up, the piece you clicked on will almost never be the piece that gets picked up, instead you will end up with one that was behind it. When you then release the mouse button to drop the piece back to have another go at getting the one you want, all pieces in the area of the drop are reset to their initial locations, often meaning the piece you were trying to pick up is now nowhere to be seen.

I enjoyed the challenging ones more and it would have been nice to have had more puzzles at the top level.Tip: Play like you would with a physical one.

												VERDICT: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a well-made game that provides a good if quite not complete simulation of jigsaw puzzle-solving on a PC. There are a good number of puzzles to solve, with a fair variety of pictures. Each one using a nice mix of colours and joins to keep the challenge fresh and the puzzle-solving experience interesting.  While the learning curve may about right for casual players the overall difficulty is pretty easy. Even the hardest puzzle is just a question of applying time, patience and perseverance to reach the final solution. Probably the only thing missing is that pieces cannot be rotated which though significant isnt really an issue.I enjoyed it. Its not my sort of usual game but its relaxing enough to while away some time between larger more complex or action-oriented games. If you have ever received a physical jigsaw puzzle and enjoy solving them then you will enjoy the challenge the game provides even if it is not a complete representation. If you have never tried solving puzzles in real-life then this may be ideal for you to try and see if you like it.... More info below ...01. GENRE: Casual Jigsaw Puzzle Simulation.02. SETTING: Japan themed pictures.03. STORY/BACKGROUND: n/a.04. GAME MODES: Single-player. As its name implies the game allows you to play (make) twenty-one unique jigsaw puzzles of various sizes and difficulty, with themed pictures from one of my favourite cultures - Japan. Smaller puzzles those with fewer pieces must be completed in order to progress to harder ones those with more pieces.05. GAME/LEVEL DESIGN: Overall the design is spartan with the only focus being to complete the puzzle. The makers have included almost all the few facets required to keep jigsaw-puzzle solving great fun and the range of pictures ensures boredom wont set in. 06. GAMEPLAY/MECHANICS: The aim is of course easy enough.  Rearrange the pieces to complete the original picture.  Playing pieces are cut differently between most pictures. You can call upon a picture reveal feature to receive hints in-game. Different joint designs ensure that players will not get used to one style of grooves which keeps playing fresh. There is no mid-game saving unfortunately. Which is not a problem with the smaller puzzles but if you want to take a break during an attempt on the larger puzzles you will need to complete it or restart from scratch.Pieces of the jigsaw cannot be rotated, so this makes solving them a little easier. Even if the addition of a 'stream' to keep the pieces moving was added to replace this, it makes picking up pieces that much more fiddly. To the point that it becomes fairly annoying when after five or sixe tries on the larger puzzles, you cannot pick up the piece you want.07. ENEMIES: N/a.08. A.I: N/a.09. CONTROLS: Mostly its a question of mouse-driven point and drag. Letting go where you wish to place the current selected piece. Moving the cursor over the piece that you wish to select isnt as straightforward as you would imagine. Especially with the constant movement of all pieces in the stream. Though strangely, this seems to be an intended 'feature' not a bug. Likely something to replace the lack of rotating pieces which you would get in RL.  At least when a piece is dropped there is a nice sounds to inform players that it has been placed on its correct position.10. GRAPHICS: Decent well-drawn/computerized pictures and portraits of Japanese themed subjects. Nothing amazing but more than adequate. 11. SOUNDTRACK & AUDIO: A melodic Japanese themed score that chimes along at an apt rate in keeping with the slow methodical way in which many players (I expect) will be attempting to solve their puzzles.12. VOICE ACTING: N/a.13. CHALLENGE/DIFFICULTY: Fairly easy. Especially the first few puzzles. There are a few harder ones providing more of a challenge later in the game.  Plus the variation in joint design adds to the problem solving as progress is made.14. PROBLEMS: Picking up intended pieces as they are constantly moving in the stream. Though as explained this likely a feature with a non-pinpoint mouse cursor. I was also unable to capture screenshots using the Steam overlay.15. ACHIEVEMENTS: Easy to complete. Almost all are triggered on solved the puzzles available in game. A further two are quick fun interface achievements.16. DLC: None. There are other games in the series that use other themes if you want more of the same.17. MODDING/ONLINE PLAY/COMMUNITY: N/a18. ENJOYMENT/APPEAL: Anyone who like solving jigsaw puzzles and has a computer will enjoy it. Bonus if you like all things Japan.  IF you are a lover of hardcore or action games you may best our time on other games!19. PLAYTIME/LONGEVITY/REPLAYABILITY: I suppose if you dont mind replaying the puzzles over and over you could potentially play this infinitely or at least many many times. Otherwise there is a good 10h+ if you are just happy to play through each puzzle once and only once.20. VALUE FOR MONEY: Great on a sale. I wouldnt necessary recommend it at full price though it depends, on how many times you intend to replay the puzzles. Personally I don't feel the retail price offers value for money unless you aim to replay the puzzles every so often. As this is the first in the series unless you are put off by the Japanese theme or prefer one of the other titles (Zombie, Birds or Anime...) I suggest you pick this up in a a sale.			"

Cons:Moving free pieces that make you fight for the right to pick them up, and not in a good way.Bad ui choices make you looking for the play button, and you click to find out what the other ones do, they dont make sense visually.Puzzles reset when you leavePros:At least the pieces don't rotatePiles you make tend to disperse pieces in order of puzzle placing, which is a boon			"

												Simple jigsaw puzzle game that somehow gets it wrong.I like both digital and physical jigsaw puzzles. I'm not spectacular at them or anything but I enjoy them. Guess I'm a boring dude! Needless to say I figured this game would occupy me for a few hours and be worth the trade I made for it. But it suffers from a some flaws. The difficulty curve is non-existent; Beyond piece count increasing there's no challenge. There is no piece rotation so each piece is always in it's correct orientation. Then the way some puzzles are ""cut"" the pieces are TOO unique and spotting a pair is a breeze. Pieces lock to their place on the board so any time you're stuck you can drag and drop around until you get ""lucky"" if you're really determined to get rid of a piece. But pieces will not lock to each other freely outside of their spot on the board, so there's no putting together a few pieces out of place and moving them all together into place later.Interaction and interface is um weird;You have your build space but no open space to pre-build (not that you can anyway like mentioned above). All the ""loose"" pieces are floating in a upside-down L-shaped koi pond and they are constantly floating around and moving. And there, I swear to you, lurks a little gremlin of monumental proportions! And it isn't the koi fish... You can't see him but I swear to you he is there. No matter what. I dunno how the game does it. But no matter what. The piece you want to click to pick up will NEVER be the piece you want if there's another piece remotely close. It is absolutely uncanny. I actually get excited when I get a piece I was actually trying to snag, that's how rarely it happens. I thought it was just with edges, that it didn't like edge pieces, but nope. There's a effin' gremlin in there mocking me and making my mouse click pick up anything but the piece I want. This issue gets more and more ridiculous as the amount of pieces increases. The koi pond stays the same size and more and more pieces go in it as you get to later puzzles. pieces will begin to overlap four or more deep in later puzzles. And the gremlin will just laugh at you. Then there's the normal small dev team stuff you could normally overlook;-Puzzle pieces in the koi pond are much smaller than on the board creating visual discrepancies.-When you ""drop"" a piece back to the pond it doesn't go where you drop it, it goes to a specific starting point in the middle of the action. So you cannot attempt any organization of pieces. -Sound settings made in main menu don't save to in-game. I wanted music off and SFX on. But then in-game its just everything off or everything on. -Messed with windows 10 title bars when played fullscreen and minimized to desktop.-Always launches in fullscreen even if you switched to windowed last play.-No saving mid-puzzle. -Etc.Just can't recommend it. At any price.			"

Secondly, I wish there were more higher count puzzles, or at least an option to increase piece count for earlier puzzles. After working the higher count puzzles, it feels pointless to go back to the lower count puzzles, making your choice of puzzles to rework very limited.			"

Game will be like: ""are you sure you want to use this piece? what about this? or that? let's try this one over there... maybe you will like it instead of one you tried to select..."" Seriuously game is giving you pieces that aren't even that close to the one you can actually click. It can be really frustrating sometimes- no ""save"" option, which would be useful in the last levelsIn the end I would recommend this game to friends because it is nice in general, and despite its own problems I still get back to playing it.

												A jigsaw puzzle with pictures of Japan's well known symbols. Good pick if you like jigsaw puzzles. 21 stages with increasing difficulty from a humble 60 piece to a large 350 piece puzzle. (!) May very well take an hour to finish a puzzle, so play during a long break or something similar.Pros:+It's a jigsaw puzzle.+Trading cards (If you're interested)+Pictures are nice+Help aid by showing the finished picture over the puzzle (chargeable thru piece-fitting)Cons+Struggling on picking the jigsaw pieces as it floats around on the koi pond.+No save feature. If you exit in the middle of the game, you have to start your puzzle from the beginning.All in all a good time waster.			"

												I really enjoy this game. I love puzzles and I love the pictures of Japan, its so pretty! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys jig-saw puzzles and pictures of Japan. There is a couple flaws to the game though that you should know before you purchase it. 1. Sometimes when you click on a puzzle piece that happens to be surrounded by other pieces, it may take you 50 tried before actually picking up the piece you want. 2. There is NO SAVING OPTIONS. And this can be a big issue when you need to take a break while in the middle of a puzzle, once you close out of it you can never go back to that progress you made.They really should fix that.			"

												Computer puzzle games have been around for a long while – well as far as I can remember. My earliest knowledge is called ‘European Scene Jigsaw Puzzles Vol. 1’ by Thorn EMI UK way back in 1981.  A nice game with crisp graphics amid the moderate choice of colours, it served its purpose. Fast forward to April 2014, another puzzle game caught my attention which happens to be in the form of this review – Pixel Puzzles: Japan. What attracted me to this game is the theme (Japan) that plays upon the ‘traditional’ puzzle gameplay. Well, once I have knocked out all the puzzles, this puzzle game leaves a lot to be desired.So let’s start off with the good points first. This puzzle game certainly does have a traditional Japanese feel with the puzzle borders filled with water and floating Lilly pads – that is the Koi Pond. Also there’s a carp swimming about where you can actually can catch it. Place the carp on the puzzle board and he’ll fishtail back (excuse the pun) to the pond. There are other things you can do to the carp however I let you discover it (and no, you cannot eat it).There are nineteen puzzles to choose from and the pieces range from sixty to the granddaddy three hundred and fifty. I guess the puzzle purists won’t considering three hundred and fifty large however, in this game, it’s the largest. The puzzle pieces are not your ‘traditional’ piece as most have weird shapes to them. In addition to this, you cannot refer to the puzzle picture at all as there’s an additional ‘feature’ where you need to unlock - the ‘Power of the I-Ching’.The way this works is that there’s a golden ‘Yin Yang’ piece randomly placed in the puzzle. Once you place the piece on the random placement, you unlock one part of the I-Ching. Do this eight times you can use its power. The power is the reveal the actual picture for a short moment or two and that’s about it. Talking about a buzz killer aye. I guess the developers needs something ‘authentic’ to enhance this game.And now here comes the unpleasant parts. First thing is this I-Ching concept – personally it’s just a waste of feature as the puzzles are all quite easy to do. Granted some are a little difficult however for me, the I-Ching is just a gimmick that can do without. Secondly, you can go crazily clicking on every part of the canvas until the piece slots in as there’s no penalty to do so. Also, because the game forces the pieces to slot in nicely, it takes away the fun of building ‘mini canvases’ all over the board.Third, you cannot rotate the pieces so every piece is the right way up so it’s making this easy puzzle game even easier to play. Fourth, there’s no save feature so you cannot park the puzzle to take a little rest and fifth, there’s a bug where, when you try to grab a puzzle piece from the pond, there’s a good chance that you will select another piece close to it instead of the one you have chosen. I think the reason behind this is the puzzle's algorithm. It’s designed that, if there’s a couple of pieces bunched up together, the algorithm selects the piece that represents the north western corner of the picture first and finally, south eastern corner last.Yet there’s two more that really grips me the most. The first being the quality of all the pictures. I presume they are the developer's photos however, all the pictures are extremely low quality. This is an absolute no-no as, being a puzzle game, its primary objective is to provide the user high quality pictures. The second is the abysmal sounds – the background music is nothing more than a short musical scores that loops over and over again. Also the sound quality, just like the photos are abysmal – very low quality; so low you can even hear the hissing sound. At least they could have bought a decent microphone or maybe remove the hissing sound from the original recording.Other than completing the puzzles, there’s an extra feature where you can view the gallery and see who made this game (without the dart board). There’s also two additional puzzles to complete at any time as, I believe are the free DLC for this game – another words, you don’t have to unlock them. So being a ‘traditional’ puzzle game is nothing more than a farce. With so many negatives, it’s a wonder why I completed all the puzzles. Actually the main reason why I did is because of the achievements. If there wasn’t any, this puzzle game will be ditched straight into the bin, figuratively speaking.3 / 10			"

A jigsaw puzzle game where you can't do many of the things you would likely do when putting together a physical jigsaw puzzle.First off, when tweaking with the options setting such as changing from fullscreen to window (no resolution options available), music, and sound effects, none of the settings stay the same when you start the game up again; you'd have to retweak all that stuff to their desired place. The options menu itself doesn't really contain all that much anyway.Puzzle pieces can't be rotated but are apparently already turned the right way so there'd be no need for that.You can't piece together matching jigsaw puzzles; each individual piece can only be snapped on the canvas where they belong even if there are no other pieces around. This means that you can basically grab a puzzle piece and keep dragging & dropping the thing all over the canvas, if desired, until it snaps into the place where it's apparently supposed to go.The puzzle pieces you're supposed to grab outside of the canvas don't stay still; they slowly float about on a pond outside of the field bouncing from walls, a few sometimes get stuck on a wall and just stay still for whatever reason. It becomes more of a bother than a challenge (if it's even supposed to be a challenge of some kind) since the pieces will always overlap one another, so way too likely you won't always grab the puzzle piece you want even if the mouse is on the desired piece. This is much worse later on when the pieces become smaller and higher in number. You can drag the puzzle pieces out of the pond to the canvas but that's more than likely to just block the view of the canvas itself with clutter.If you were to leave a puzzle-in-progress it doesn't save and there's no option to. If you need to exit the game you'd have to start whatever puzzle you were doing all over again.I was hoping this jigsaw puzzle game was more of the things I'd do with a pyshical one and not just a game where I just drag piece (A) to point (B) with the addition of technical nuisances.

												Its a nice, somewhat relaxing jigsaw puzzle game. The puzzle pieces float around in a ""stream"" and at times it can be frustrating trying to pick up a certain puzzle piece. Its easy to get all of the achievements, just complete all the puzzles. Its a fun game if you like puzzles. 8/10			"

												Simple jigsaw puzzle game that somehow gets it wrong.I like both digital and physical jigsaw puzzles. I'm not spectacular at them or anything but I enjoy them. Guess I'm a boring dude! Needless to say I figured this game would occupy me for a few hours and be worth the trade I made for it. But it suffers from a some flaws. The difficulty curve is non-existent; Beyond piece count increasing there's no challenge. There is no piece rotation so each piece is always in it's correct orientation. Then the way some puzzles are ""cut"" the pieces are TOO unique and spotting a pair is a breeze. Pieces lock to their place on the board so any time you're stuck you can drag and drop around until you get ""lucky"" if you're really determined to get rid of a piece. But pieces will not lock to each other freely outside of their spot on the board, so there's no putting together a few pieces out of place and moving them all together into place later.Interaction and interface is um weird;You have your build space but no open space to pre-build (not that you can anyway like mentioned above). All the ""loose"" pieces are floating in a upside-down L-shaped koi pond and they are constantly floating around and moving. And there, I swear to you, lurks a little gremlin of monumental proportions! And it isn't the koi fish... You can't see him but I swear to you he is there. No matter what. I dunno how the game does it. But no matter what. The piece you want to click to pick up will NEVER be the piece you want if there's another piece remotely close. It is absolutely uncanny. I actually get excited when I get a piece I was actually trying to snag, that's how rarely it happens. I thought it was just with edges, that it didn't like edge pieces, but nope. There's a effin' gremlin in there mocking me and making my mouse click pick up anything but the piece I want. This issue gets more and more ridiculous as the amount of pieces increases. The koi pond stays the same size and more and more pieces go in it as you get to later puzzles. pieces will begin to overlap four or more deep in later puzzles. And the gremlin will just laugh at you. Then there's the normal small dev team stuff you could normally overlook;-Puzzle pieces in the koi pond are much smaller than on the board creating visual discrepancies.-When you ""drop"" a piece back to the pond it doesn't go where you drop it, it goes to a specific starting point in the middle of the action. So you cannot attempt any organization of pieces. -Sound settings made in main menu don't save to in-game. I wanted music off and SFX on. But then in-game its just everything off or everything on. -Messed with windows 10 title bars when played fullscreen and minimized to desktop.-Always launches in fullscreen even if you switched to windowed last play.-No saving mid-puzzle. -Etc.Just can't recommend it. At any price.			"

												In Pixel Puzzles: Japan you need to solve a selection of 19 puzzles with different scenarios, difficulties and pictures. The concept is quite easy, you have pieces and you need to put them all together. The difference is, these pieces (who are also not your typical ones, with different shapes and sizes) are not static and they are always moving up and down and from left to right in some sort of koi pond. There is no timer for you to solve these puzzles and there are no tricks so take your time and have a bit of relaxing time if you have been playing something story heavy or you just want to escape from the usual violence on shooting in other games. The pictures are inspired by the Japanese culture so expect a lot of pink from the cherry bosom trees or some old statues and buildings. It took me around 12 hours to finish all these puzzles and it was a great choice to play between other games. As the levels progress so do you. You are a young disciple Monk, and as you advance in harder puzzles you will improve as well until you attain your “enlightenment”.  While the moving pieces was an interesting idea it may become a bit frustrating on the final puzzles. Some pieces become smaller and the number of them will increase so it means more pieces will be moving. If you want to click and drag a specific piece you saw this may prove to be harder considering there are so many moving and the mouse pointer did not feel so accurate at times. Just like when doing a normal puzzle, I always start with the surrounding frame and then move to one of the corners and keep going from there. Some puzzles can take more time than others and I struggled with one that had too many similar colors in all places which brings another flaw: there is no save or pause option. If you want to start a new level you may as well finish it, otherwise you will need to restart all over This is not an issue on most of the puzzles but if a puzzle is taking you longer than expected or you need to leave your PC, having an option to not start all over again would be a good thing to have.In the end this was a nice little time sink. The music is simple but relaxing enough but after a couple of hours I decided to put my own playlist of Zen/Meditation music and the results were much better. I felt relaxed and the game does exactly what you should expect.			"

												A classic tabletop puzzle simulator... except the unused pieces of puzzle float in a pond with a koi fish and some weird asian dude is trying to attain nirvana. Not much to say here, it does what it says it does. It doesnt offer a lot of it but it still is time consuming. Because... it is a puzzle game. This one has japanese images. Not the cute anime stuff, more like statues and pictures of houses. I would rather play the zombie version of this game. Still auntie likes it...			"

												Imagine trying to put together a puzzle, but the spare pieces (or as the game calls them, ""peices"") are on an air hockey table. Every time you put a piece down, it gets mixed back into the jumbled mess. Every time you try to pick up a piece, you grab the wrong one a half-dozen times before you get the one you were aiming for.Okay, now add a coat of paint that can't decide if it's Shinto, Taoist, or Buddhist. Throw in a few Chinese things in there because why the hell not, you're already mashing together enough East Asian things, a little racism only adds more flavor.If you're selling a generic jigsaw puzzle game, theme and gimmicks are super important to sell your product. But it feels like a white game design student who has only read about Japan in travel guides designed this thing. It's cringe-worthy.TL;DR - Bad gimmicky jigsaw puzzle game, cultural appropriation flavored. Not worth it for gameplay nor card drops.			"

												Sad, but true: Put ""Japan"" in your game title and the game will sell.But I could let that ""slide"", because it's a puzzle game after all...PUZZLE - yes! Puzzle. Though the creator went out of his way to do everything to take the PUZZLE element out of the game.What's left? Well... do you know the experience of cutting & pasting multiple lines in a textfile? That's what this game is.Let me eleborate:1) You do not ""rotate"" the pieces, they are pre-fixed to be alligned correctly the moment you ""fish"" them out of the pond. 2) Double clicking somewhere around the area automatically fixes the position of your puzzle piece and thus takes away the challenging element. They stay fixed in that position also, so you already know you got the puzzle piece at the right spot.3) The shapes of the pieces are so easily distinguishable that you don't even have to look at the overall picture to arrange them together.What's fun about puzzle games? Not knowing which direction the puzzle piece goes, not knowing where to put it and having the joy of finally fitting one with the other after a long time of ""puzzling"".  The creator took all those 3 elements away and what's left is a drag... litterally dragging the pieces to the board and be done with it.Verdict: FAIL2/10			"

												There are times in everyone's life when you're so stressed you have barely enough energy to play more than an old fashioned puzzle. When that times comes for you, stear clear from this one. The music isn't bad. The weirdly cut puzzle pieces aren't bad. The pictures aren't bad. The idea of the moving/floating puzzle pieces, while strange at first, isn't bad, theoretically. It doesn't allow easy organization of the pieces, and basically asks you to go about it one piece at the time. That could potentially have made the puzzles harder, but in an interesting way.Here's the problem: If you are basing the whole concept of your take on a traditional game on a mechanic that doesn't work, you are doing it wrong. And the ""floating pieces"" idea doesn't work, because the click detection on these floating pieces simply doesn't work. The game consitently fails to recognise the piece you click on, even when it is clearly on top of every other piece and you clearly click in the middle of the piece. The detection rate is so horrible, that it makes the game frustrating. It's plain and simple flawed execution of the main game mechanic.That aside, there is a rather limited number of puzzles (16 or so?), probably finishable in under 8 hours (many of my hours up there are just idling). The lack of any type of save function is another fatal flaw.So, no, this isn't a good puzzle game in any way. Get it really, really, really cheap with really low expectations.			"

												One of the few acutal ""puzzle"" games on steam (puzzle as in jigsaw puzzle, rather than the catch-all genre name); sadly, it isn't really all that impressive.  The early puzzles are easy enough but as more pieces get added to the more difficult puzzles, the ""pool"" that jumbles all the pieces gets so full that it is actually quite difficult picking up pieces.  In the end, the concept seems simple enough, but sadly the execution leaves a lot to be desired.  Only pick it up if you're getting it in one of the various game bundles out there.			"

All that is not the problem, the rest is.The game feels very uninspired, I really don't like the art style, and the music/sounds are not agreeing with me either.It's a small niche genre, not alot of games to choose from.

												I purchased this game on sale and I only recommend this game when it's on sale.In all honesty, I've never been so irritated playing a game since the last time I've played League of Legends. Let me describe to you what is so irritating. The play area is made up of a table which you assemble the puzzle pieces on and there's a river/pool along the left and top edge of the screen that the unused pieces float around in. Now in the early levels where there's less pieces and the pieces are larger this pool is fine and works great. However, when you progress and the pieces become smaller and more of them it's almost impossible to click on the piece you need. The majority of the time spent on this game has been trying to click on a piece I need and picking up pieces that my cursor isn't even touching. I wish this game wasn't digital so I could flip the table over.Now if you can get passed the irritating pool the game is fine and enjoyable. It's a jigsaw puzzle game. You piece the puzzle together and you complete the puzzle. It's as simple as that and done well in that regard.			"

												(Review from September 2014)I bought this game when it was on sale for around 2 bucks and overall I think it's worth that.There are some negative aspects: Inaccuracy. If you try to pick up a piece you almost never get the one you wanted, especially on the last stages when there are many pieces floating in the pond. No save feature. If you leave your current puzzle, you'll have to start from scratch the next time. I often found myself in a puzzle without really knowing how the result is supposed to look like. The only preview you get is in the selection screen and very small. In order to see the full-sized picture, you first have to place enough pieces correctly and fill up the bar on the right, then you get a glimpse at the picture for a few seconds. Personally, I don't mind not having it in front of me the whole time, but it should be shown in the beginning.Apart from these points I enjoyed Pixel Puzzles: Japan as a nice and relaxing experience between fast-paced games.If you like jigsaw puzzles or want to earn some easy achievements (takes around 12-16 hours), this game is for you.

												Since there's really not that much to say about jigsaw puzzle games in general, this review will be a summary of pros and cons, accompanied with brief commentary by me.Pros-piece edges diversity: all puzzles have pieces with their own distinct edges (the interlocking bulges / notches), which rather give an original feeling to each puzzle.-audio: soothing Japanese background tune and sound effects-achievements: easy to accomplish a perfect game (100% achievements), only time and patience required, little skill.Cons-no save game option: can be a nuisance especially on the larger of the puzzles; several times i had to leave the game running until I got time again to complete a puzzle.-no player accounts: 1 player only, bit of a pity, since I’m father in a family of 4 gaming people, who want to track their progress separately.-amount of puzzles / smaller puzzles: there are 21 puzzles (6x60pcs / 5x112pcs / 4x153pcs / 3x220pcs / 1x350pcs / 2 additional puzzles of 153pcs (i think)); which is too few-hard to grab desired pieces from the pond: it's hard to precisely grab the piece you want from the pond, hard in such a way I’m wondering the developers have done this deliberately.-audio: only 1 background tuneIn short: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a soothing, little jigsaw puzzle game with little functionality. Would be better with more and larger puzzles, combined with a save game option. Picked it up at a sale (<€1), completed approximately 2 puzzles / week. Took my time enjoying puzzling. Perfected the game (100% achievements) in 17 hours and moved on. Probably never replaying Pixel Puzzles: Japan again, since there are other Pixel Puzzles versions on the market I want to complete. When my desire to puzzle comes back, that is.Greetings and have fun			"

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a casual jigsaw game. It is the first jigsaw puzzle game on Steam and it is relaxing and fun.The gameplay is simple and self explenatory, just like in the original board game you have to fit together puzzle pieces to form a beautiful japanese scenery. There are 19 different puzzles, ranging from ones with 60 pieces to one with 350 pieces. Each puzzle in this game has a different picture but also the puzzle pieces differ as well. This game offers an unique experience since some of the puzzles have pieces with shapes that you won't see in real life. Unlike in real life you can see the image of the puzzle you are working on just before starting the level. There is a power-up that fills up and shows the original picture for a few seconds if used. There is no time or objectives, so the game is very relaxing and you have nothing to worry about. Also, there is a fish swimming in the river that you can play with, for fun. On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this game. There is no save feature mid puzzle so if you leave a puzzle you have to start it over. That is a big problem in the last levels since they take a lot of time to finish so your only option is to leave your PC open. Another flaw is selecting the pieces you want. The puzzle pieces float around a river around the ''table''. That is a good ideea, but when you try to click on the piece you want you will probably end up selecting another piece and having to put it back into the river and sometimes the piece you want disappears into another point of the river.The graphics are pretty nice and the japanese pictures very beautiful. The music is relaxing just as the gameplay.I recommend this game, casual, relaxing and fun, 8/10.			"

												A nice, relaxing game to play when you're bored.The Puzzles become gradually more challenging and there are almost 20 of them.For people who like puzzling I can recommend that game.Unfortunately the mouse-click-handling often behaves very unexpected, so that instead of picking the exact puzzle piece you're clicking on it picks another one which actually was drawn below the one you clicked on.But puzzles are games which require a lot of patience anyway, so I guess that shouldn't be too bad.Oh and yeah, as I've read in other reviews, there's actually no save-feature... so you need to finish a puzzle in one session.(Also it doesn't even remember the settings you chose in the options menu, e.g. volume, fullscreen, etc.)			"

												Rating: 6/10Classic jigsaw puzzle game with various shapes and Japanese theme. Process is unlockable, you will go through 19 different puzzles, from 60 pieces to 350 pieces. I'm not sure if it is worth the money, but I enjoyed it playing from time to time.Also, it is a great pick-up for 100% achievement hunters.			"

												I enjoy doing puzzles and this game hits that itch.  Fix puzzle piece selection detection and you've got my vote. (9-12)Pros  Relaxing atmosphere of music and theme.   Nice puzzle picturesCons  Terrible puzzle piece selector detection!  On the later levels there are constant overlapping pieces floating around to grab. Even if you are clicking on a piece that is on top it will randomly grab a piece.  It can take minutes to get a particular piece you want..  If this alone was fixed, I'd recommend this puzzle game more.     Some of the sounds/music can get old after a while. I wish there was more music selection.    A few puzzles had so little color variation, it was a matter of guessing all combinations ( cherry blossom pic in particular ).      Most others were fine. Wantsa section on side where you can put pieces you want to keep tabs on but not clutter up the puzzle picture space.  it allows you to hang pieces on the border, but thats not much. be able to combine pieces that you know fit together, without knowing their proper location yet.

												I'd recommend this game for folks who love puzzles but are short on space, have cats, or for some other reason are unable to pull out a 1000+ piece puzzle to assemble. To fully enjoy the game, players should probably also like games that require catching something that is moving with a click of the controller...or fishing games. There are, however, a few points that could be polished up:- The mouse pointer is not very accurate and sometimes sluggish.- The game lacks a true working space to organize selected puzzle pieces. (If you accidentally put the right piece in the right place on the board the piece will lock down, so it's a bit risky - and un-fun - to only have the puzzle board to place various fished-out pieces.)- You can catch the koi...but it does nothing.- There's no save option. Be prepared to have enough time to complete the puzzle when you sit down to play (most don't take *that* long) or to leave the game running in the background when something comes up.- The speed of the flow in the puzzle piece ""pond"" is not adjustable. When combined with mouse accuracy issues, clicking for puzzle pieces can be fairly random.- The pieces get smaller as the number of pieces increases...which, at times, made me feel like I might go blind. (Playing on laptop.)The above list seems like a lot of things that can be improved, I know. And if any of the above would drive you bonkers, then maybe this game won't be a good choice for you. However, if the above points won't ruin your gaming experience and you love puzzles/puzzling games, then I reccomend playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan.			"

												A very nice game with magnificent images from Japan. Nice ambient music and sounds, and of course newly added achievements for the hunters out there. It is a little bit of addictive, so do not forget to take your eyes away from the screen once in a while. Also prepare for a lot of rage explosions while trying to pick the piece you want but you pick all the other ones … but the one you actually want. Great puzzle (literally) game over all. Do recommend.			"

												If you like building puzzles, Pixel Puzzles: Japan should be right up your alley.  But it doesn't come without it's share of problems that distract from the overall enjoyment of the game.First to deserve mention is the inability to save your progress (at least, I could not find any such feature or mechanic anywhere).  If you start building a puzzle, you need to commit to finishing it.  For the earlier puzzles that have fewer pieces this is not a problem.  But getting along to the more advanced puzzles with a lot more pieces, it takes one quite a while to complete a puzzle, which you now have to do in one sitting.Which leads me to the second distraction.  When building a puzzle, all of the available pieces are floating along the left and top sides of the screen.  You pick a piece up from these areas and drag them onto the puzzle for placement.For early puzzles this is easy.  However, once the puzzles get to have 100+ pieces, the areas get a bit crowded and picking up a piece becomes a mini-game in itself.  A frustrating one at that.You can clearly see a piece floating about that you wish to pick up, but click on it and somehow you will have picked up a piece underneath it or floating off to the side of it.  Sometimes it takes up to 10 tries just to pick up the piece you want.And dropping an unwanted piece results in all of the pieces around the drop point to disappear and reappear somewhere else.  Thus, you sometimes inadvertently lose the piece you actually want, because you dropped an unwanted pick-up on top of it.Lastly, there are only 21 puzzles to build.  Once you've built them all, the game is pretty much over unless you wish to re-build a certain puzzle.These are some minor niggles and personal experiences that shouldn't detract from the overall game, but I feel are worth mentioning.If you like building puzzles, you should give Pixel Puzzles: Japan a go.  If you like building puzzles but get frustrated easily, I'd lay caution in the road as you might fall to pieces while trying to pick up the pieces....			"

												Very fun, relaxing, and a nice timewaster. The finished puzzle images look gorgeous and the harder ones are quite satisfying to accomplish. The one song that plays during the game is fairly decent, but some people may find it annoying after awhile. Luckily, there is an option to turn off the sound. The price isn't too bad, although I did purchase it when it was on sale, and as of now there are 21 different puzzles to play. The developers did mention ""multiple free bonus puzzles"" so there might be more to come in the future.My only two complaints are that having the puzzle pieces constantly moving around makes it frustratingly difficult to grab the one that you want, so you may have to take out a few pieces before getting a certain one. My other complaint is that there seems to be no way of saving my progress on a puzzle so I can come back to it later. It's not really a big deal with the smaller, easier puzzles, but once you get up to 220 pieces and beyond, it can be a pain to have to assemble the entire puzzle in one go.Despite those issues I mentioned, this is a lovely puzzle game. I highly recommend it to any jigsaw puzzle fans looking for something to unwind and relax with.			"

												Here’s something I never thought I’d say: I actually rather enjoyed Pixel Puzzles: Japan.Aside from the rapid onset of carpal tunnel, this game wasn’t terrible. I’m not sure if it was situational when I played it (at nights while staying oceanfront) or if the game is actually acceptable but I had fun. In fact, considering I paid nothing for it, the only real flaw I saw was that god forsaken river the pieces floated in. Oh my god I have never been so annoyed by anything in a game before. And don’t even get me started on the “zen” water pipe thing. Word of advice: Immediately stuff that stupid koi in there and shut it up. Also why on earth are we not allowed to save progress on a puzzle and come back to it later?I guess the game is kinda crap.. but I didn’t spend a penny on it and I had fun, so yeah take from that what you will.

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a cute puzzle game with some beautiful pictures to put together. Although the selection of puzzles is a bit small, I did spend quite a bit of time completing them all. The added difficulty of fishing the pieces out of the koi pond was a fun challenge, though it was difficult to see the pieces without yanking them all out of the pond once I reached the harder puzzles. I could have also done without the oddly shaped pieces in some situations as well (particularly the swirl-shaped edges of one puzzle). Overall a solid 4/5 game for me.			"

												Bad  points : The game has only 21 jigsaw puzzles so far by now (19 achievements and 2 in addition), which can be completed in 5 hours more or less. There is no save option so you will always have to leave the computer on while you want to take a pause from completing a puzzle. There is no zooming option which makes 200 plus pieces puzzles difficult. Another problem comes from the fish pond where you'll have quite a hard time trying to catch the piece that you want. There is no option to puzzelize your own images from the computer nor a way to add other jigsaw puzzles other than waiting for an update.Good points : The game is light and fast even on pretty old machines, thou sometimes it crashes without other programs open. The fish and the fountain can be both forgotten when you'll put one into the other XD so you'll not catch it anymore while searching your piece thou it's kinda sad seeing it there...poor fish. There are nice song pieces that change often, so if you'll not like a specific song, you'll have to wait just a while and it's gone. Since they are pieces, it also contributes to the light weight of the game. You can mute the songs if you really dislike them. In the extras there are the photos of the puzzles, so be sure to check it before attempting to complete a puzzle. The images are kinda tricky with many similar colors this makes the puzzles fun, not to mention that they are wonderful. If you'll find the images too difficult for you, the anchor system of the pieces will come handy for you, thou it is a bit too sensible. The pond idea with the pieces floating in it is also nice but if you can get rid of the fish, you cannot do the same with the flowers and pieces can hide under them, like when they stuck in a corner... kinda tricky. Overall it's really nice, also because you can repeat the puzzles that you want, or force yourself by deleting the data and starting all over.			"

												It's what you'd expect, some small jigsaw puzzles (60 pieces thru 330 pieces) attached to some achievements to incentivize playing.

												Since there's really not that much to say about jigsaw puzzle games in general, this review will be a summary of pros and cons, accompanied with brief commentary by me.Pros-piece edges diversity: all puzzles have pieces with their own distinct edges (the interlocking bulges / notches), which rather give an original feeling to each puzzle.-audio: soothing Japanese background tune and sound effects-achievements: easy to accomplish a perfect game (100% achievements), only time and patience required, little skill.Cons-no save game option: can be a nuisance especially on the larger of the puzzles; several times i had to leave the game running until I got time again to complete a puzzle.-no player accounts: 1 player only, bit of a pity, since I’m father in a family of 4 gaming people, who want to track their progress separately.-amount of puzzles / smaller puzzles: there are 21 puzzles (6x60pcs / 5x112pcs / 4x153pcs / 3x220pcs / 1x350pcs / 2 additional puzzles of 153pcs (i think)); which is too few-hard to grab desired pieces from the pond: it's hard to precisely grab the piece you want from the pond, hard in such a way I’m wondering the developers have done this deliberately.-audio: only 1 background tuneIn short: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a soothing, little jigsaw puzzle game with little functionality. Would be better with more and larger puzzles, combined with a save game option. Picked it up at a sale (<€1), completed approximately 2 puzzles / week. Took my time enjoying puzzling. Perfected the game (100% achievements) in 17 hours and moved on. Probably never replaying Pixel Puzzles: Japan again, since there are other Pixel Puzzles versions on the market I want to complete. When my desire to puzzle comes back, that is.Greetings and have fun			"

												The first game in the Pixel Puzzles series that I played. It delivers the jigsaw puzzle experience that you'd expect (imagine).  It's okay, there's not much to say about it. Rotating pieces is not possible, they are always in the correct orientation - I have no issue with this. There is some sort of hint system, but I haven't used it very much at all. Instead, there is a delightful exploit that efficiently helps with the more aggravating, end-game pictures. One minor annoyance is that you cannot enjoy a moment with the picture you just completed, as there is immediately a popup on top of it.			"

												This game is as simple as it sounds. You put together digital jigsaw puzzles in the theme of Japanese locations and nature settings. The difficulty steadily increases with increasingly complex images and higher piece-counts until you reach the end. The later puzzles initially seemed as if they could take forever but I could tell that there was some type of subtle assist in place, as I too often would find the piece I needed when the situation should have been like a needle-in-a-haystack. Probably because of limited screen real estate making it too complex to play completely true-to-life. No matter, the game is enjoyable and plenty relaxing. The sounds are naturally fairly soothing but i also enjoyed listening to some albums while I played and collected the achievements.			"

												Who knew solving jigsaw puzzles could lead to total enlightenment, well, at least it does for the monk in the game ~There are 19 puzzles to solve, and all of them are Japanese landscapes, which are very beautiful.The difficulty rises as you unlock more puzzles. Basically, after you've played a few of them, the number of pieces will increase.The music is relaxing, though it loops a lot, and does not vary much, which I thought was a little disappointing.My biggest problem with the game is the mechanic to pick up a piece. Sometimes, my mouse will pick up the wrong piece and it will take several tries for it to finally detect the one I wanted.In addition, you can't save the game while doing the jigsaw puzzle, so you better not close it if you don't want to lose your progress. It is a relaxing and just a fine casual game to kill some time. But some parts of it are frustrating.Despite some nice features, I will not recommend the game, unless you get it at a decent price or from a bundle.My reason being that picking up pieces was very annoying >_< especially at the end of the game, when there was a lot of pieces in the water. It made the game less fun...it also strained my eyes =_=;~ Hope this review was helpful.			"

												You can pick up any piece, and I mean it, you can grab ANY piece, but the one you want.  It's so frustrating. I didn't even know how to start the game (it really has a horrible and useless interface), so I started this one puzzle with 220 pieces (don't even ask me how) and it was simply a nightmare. If you could at least pick the piece you wanted, it'd be way easier. Oh, and after finishing that puzzle, which took me about 2 hours, the game still says that I have completed ""0 puzzles""... I mean, really?! Ouch. I wouldn't recommend it... unless you enjoy raging at the computer. I just wanted to relax and now I want to throw the laptop through the window, great job Pixel Puzzles: Japan!			"

												Rating: 6/10Classic jigsaw puzzle game with various shapes and Japanese theme. Process is unlockable, you will go through 19 different puzzles, from 60 pieces to 350 pieces. I'm not sure if it is worth the money, but I enjoyed it playing from time to time.Also, it is a great pick-up for 100% achievement hunters.			"

												Bad  points : The game has only 21 jigsaw puzzles so far by now (19 achievements and 2 in addition), which can be completed in 5 hours more or less. There is no save option so you will always have to leave the computer on while you want to take a pause from completing a puzzle. There is no zooming option which makes 200 plus pieces puzzles difficult. Another problem comes from the fish pond where you'll have quite a hard time trying to catch the piece that you want. There is no option to puzzelize your own images from the computer nor a way to add other jigsaw puzzles other than waiting for an update.Good points : The game is light and fast even on pretty old machines, thou sometimes it crashes without other programs open. The fish and the fountain can be both forgotten when you'll put one into the other XD so you'll not catch it anymore while searching your piece thou it's kinda sad seeing it there...poor fish. There are nice song pieces that change often, so if you'll not like a specific song, you'll have to wait just a while and it's gone. Since they are pieces, it also contributes to the light weight of the game. You can mute the songs if you really dislike them. In the extras there are the photos of the puzzles, so be sure to check it before attempting to complete a puzzle. The images are kinda tricky with many similar colors this makes the puzzles fun, not to mention that they are wonderful. If you'll find the images too difficult for you, the anchor system of the pieces will come handy for you, thou it is a bit too sensible. The pond idea with the pieces floating in it is also nice but if you can get rid of the fish, you cannot do the same with the flowers and pieces can hide under them, like when they stuck in a corner... kinda tricky. Overall it's really nice, also because you can repeat the puzzles that you want, or force yourself by deleting the data and starting all over.			"

												Since there's really not that much to say about jigsaw puzzle games in general, this review will be a summary of pros and cons, accompanied with brief commentary by me.Pros-piece edges diversity: all puzzles have pieces with their own distinct edges (the interlocking bulges / notches), which rather give an original feeling to each puzzle.-audio: soothing Japanese background tune and sound effects-achievements: easy to accomplish a perfect game (100% achievements), only time and patience required, little skill.Cons-no save game option: can be a nuisance especially on the larger of the puzzles; several times i had to leave the game running until I got time again to complete a puzzle.-no player accounts: 1 player only, bit of a pity, since I’m father in a family of 4 gaming people, who want to track their progress separately.-amount of puzzles / smaller puzzles: there are 21 puzzles (6x60pcs / 5x112pcs / 4x153pcs / 3x220pcs / 1x350pcs / 2 additional puzzles of 153pcs (i think)); which is too few-hard to grab desired pieces from the pond: it's hard to precisely grab the piece you want from the pond, hard in such a way I’m wondering the developers have done this deliberately.-audio: only 1 background tuneIn short: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a soothing, little jigsaw puzzle game with little functionality. Would be better with more and larger puzzles, combined with a save game option. Picked it up at a sale (<€1), completed approximately 2 puzzles / week. Took my time enjoying puzzling. Perfected the game (100% achievements) in 17 hours and moved on. Probably never replaying Pixel Puzzles: Japan again, since there are other Pixel Puzzles versions on the market I want to complete. When my desire to puzzle comes back, that is.Greetings and have fun			"

												It's what you'd expect, some small jigsaw puzzles (60 pieces thru 330 pieces) attached to some achievements to incentivize playing. I could do without the floating puzzle pieces, and the use of space could be more efficient as there's limited space to drag and place the pieces forcing you to let them float.  Get it in a bundle and you're good to go.   The achievements are all easily unlocked.			"

												Honestly, I like this game. It's very piece-ful (get it?), and the puzzles are of decent challenge. The hardest part and my biggest complaint is the way you pick up the pieces. Floating around is nice, but the game hardly ever picks up the piece you are clicking on, and if you drop the piece you didn't want back in the water, it often resets the position of the pieces underneath it, making you lose track of the piece you were originally looking for. (Whew! That  was a bit of a run on...)I'd give the game an 6/10. Pros:- Puzzles are decently pieced to provide a challenge.- Graphics are decent for a casual game.Cons:- Music track is repetative and has a loud noise in it that gets annoying. (I mute while playing.)- Cursor tracking during piece pick up.- No saving! You close the game before finishing a puzzle, all progress is lost.			"

												It's a jigsaw puzzle game essentially, so the gameplay is fairly predicatble.  There are a few issues that really hurt the game.  Clicking to pick up one of the pieces on the side will more often than not pick up a piece other than the one you wanted.  Later puzzles will also make it extremely hard to find pieces that you want because they're constantly moving around the screen.  Another issue which I've just found out is that progress is not saved if you leave the game while in the middle of a puzzle.  I spent 30+ minutes on one of the harder puzzles and then came back to find that everything had reset.			"

For the memory of the Jigsaw-Mania in the 70sI remember the time quite well, when my cousins an me got a box of Jigsaws each birthday and x-mas... It was during the early 70s, and Jigsaws were all the rage...I think just because of this I am still so deeply fascinated by puzzle games of any color... Of course, this is a computer rendition of that time and as the original it is all about zen... Jigsaws are superficially very simple games of search and stack, the end product is on the cover of the box. This game captures a lot of this style, and it's all about Japan in this game. With a lot of beautiful sceneries and a fitting sound. Even a priceless Koi is swimming in the pond in which all the puzzle parts are floating.Can you wish for more, dear puzzler?Indeed you could, but that would probably take away the charm of the game at all. It's simple, it's as fast as you wish it to be and it is quite fun when you remember that this kind of game are casual games. Not to be played in one session, but when you need that kind of relaxation.I would recomend this game for the sceneries, the calmness and medative quality it has and because it is an emulation of the original Jigsaws, that still can keep people peeled to the solution, even if it takes weeks to solve.Have fun playing the game.

												How is it that I can click directly on a puzzle piece and if there's another one within a mile of it, the other one will be selected?  This game has the worst z-ordering ever.  Compounded by the blasted pieces moving around in the frustrating pond.The floating koi pond gimmick would be nice, except all the pieces cluster in the bottom left.  So it's nearly impossible to find a piece unless it's got a very distinctive color.  There is no other way to look at the pieces, of course, so you either end up hoarding them in the puzzle area, or tossing them back so they can hide every other piece you're interested in.  Normally, finding edge pieces is relatively easy, but because I couldn't sort through them individually and they conspired to get in the way of my clicks, I ended up hunting for edge pieces for nearly half an hour.  Normally that's the easy part.Finally, even if you know pieces go together and try to connect them, they won't connect to each other.  They will only snap in at their very specific places on the board.  Which is a huge step down from real puzzles, and some other puzzle games I've played.  Of course they wouldn't have a feature to name and group puzzle pieces together and get them out of the way.  It's the pond or nothing.44 minutes and I'm done.  I'm just leaving it on to farm cards at the moment.			"

												I'm a big fan of jigsaw puzzles, and I was excited when I recieved this as a gift. Now... I really hate to write negative reviews, as I try to look at the effort and love that were put in to games. But sometimes there are just games that I can't give a positive review to. And sadly? This is one of them. =Complete Review= (TL:DR version and Conclusion at the bottom)=The Gameplay: 2/5= It's rather mediocre, in terms of gameplay. Puzzle pieces snap in place when placed on their correct spot on the grid, which would be better if the pieces snapped to eachother instead... But I can understand developer-wise why they wouldn't do that, due to the fact it would be a bit of a hassle if a player put a combined-piece back in to the pond. And, it's still better than the pieces not snapping in to place at all. Speaking of the pond, it's probably a big player in the game's issues. It would be fine if it only moved the pieces around, that's a bit annoying, but I get what they were trying to do. But because of the pieces moving around, it makes picking up pieces just flat out annoying because of it sometimes glitching up pieces. You'll try to pick up a edge piece, and wind up picking up a piece that's practically another whole piece away.  Half the time I just move all the pieces from the pond on to the board, just so that way I can pick them up right.The powerup in the game is also... Strange. I only used it once so I could see how it worked. It changes the background to show the rest of the image so you'll know where to put the pieces, but personally I found it more fun to just put the puzzle together without it.  And the koi, don't get me started on the koi. Just don't... About the best part involving the koi is sticking it in the sozu. I'd say that's a redeeming feature, as the bloody fish got in my way a number of times when picking up puzzle pieces. But some people would likely just find that cruel, so it's a your-mileage-may-vary thing.=The Graphics: 3/5= Now this, is a redeeming feature of the game. The graphics look  nice in my opinion! The UI is done well, the actual images for the puzzles are of good quality, the pieces having different unique designs to mix things up in the more difficult levels. It's quite asthetically pleasing! But it's not to the level that would be considered eyecatching, and breathtaking. Well done, but not embellished much. Which, well, that's good or bad, depending on your preferences. For the concept, a simpler style does work well. But for those wanting a more ornate, and intricate looking style, this would likely not be all that pleasing to the eye for them.=The Audio: 1/5=  Ugh.. Now this is the part I absolutely hated. It was fine for maybe the first two puzzles. But the music with the haphazard sound effects tossed in just doesn't work... I mean, sure, the sound effects fit the theme, sort of. But the mixed volumes of the sound effects and the music would be more prone to cause tension as opposed to relaxation. Which, is what the theme aims for: a zen-style. I personally muted it and played more relaxing tunes to it. I'd suggest that you pick your favorite zen or relaxing music and turn that on instead if you play this.=TL;DR/Pros & Cons=ProsA pretty pleasing jigsaw puzzle game. Has achievements that are fairly easy to get.The pictures are lovely.NeutralYou get to put the koi in the sozu. The graphics are pretty simple.Puzzle pieces snap to the frame rather than to eachother.ConsThe game is a bit glitchy because of the bloody pond.The music and sfx are terrible IMO.Your progress on the puzzles are not saved.=The Conclusion: 4/10= It's a decent game if it's on a sale above 75%, but if not, it's definitely not worth the full price. It was a cute idea, but the execution was not done very well. I've played much better jigsaw puzzle games for free, of which I'd link, but that would be in poor taste. A quick google search of ""Flash Jigsaw Puzzle"" should come up with some. I appreciate your time, and thank you for reading my review.			"

												The puzzle pieces move in this game which isn't bad but sometimes they are hard to pick up and put on the board. The trick to this game is to put all the puzzle pieces in a pill on the board and then pick up each piece and somehow it will come out in order and make the puzzles a little easier. The achievements were easy to get, pretty much you complete the puzzles, and play around with the one fish by putting it on the board and into the thing that drops water at the bottom left of the screen.

												I enjoyed most of the puzzles but without a save option, I doubt that I will put in the energy to complete the last three which have hundreds of tiny pieces all floating in the pond.  Picking up pieces is frustrating because if any pieces besides the one you wanted is nearby, you will probably pick that one up.   Puzzles are normally leisurely activities where you can place a few pieces down at a time. Forced to complete a puzzle in one sitting is not relaxing.			"

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a jigsaw puzzle simulation game. It is said to have some light gameplay elemtns mixed in with putting together jigsaw puzzles. Putting together puzzles without all the mess of getting the pieces out, making sure you get them facing up, clearing the space to put it together, and then putting it away later is nice. The actual act of putting the pieces into the puzzle is fun. Some other virtual puzzles I've done are far too forgiving on how close you need to put the pieces, but this game does a good job of making you put it in the right place before it'll stick without it being too horribly specific to make you second guess yourself constantly. Some of these puzzles were fun to put together with neat pictures as a result. Also, there were some interesting edges and piece shapes which gave the different puzzles a little life and challenge to put together. The jigsaw puzzle part is good. My issues come in when you're looking at the gameplay elements that have been included to spice the game up. Either these elements should be eliminated, or there needs to be more of the elements. The elements that are there are mostly annoying or useless. Being able to pick up a fish and move it around isn't really challenging or fun, it's just useless. Completing puzzles to unlock more is also a bit useless, as anyone doing this for the sake of doing the puzzles is going to do them all anyway so having them all available to pick from would be nice. Plus, leveling up for completing puzzles just to unlock other puzzles is also fairly useless in the grand scheme of things if the only reason for them is to play more of the game you were most likely going to play more of anyway. The annoying part is how the puzzle pieces are stuck in a pool of water around the corner the table. So the pieces will freely float around, covering each other up and bouncing around, which makes them difficult to sift through. There's also an annoying priority going on. See, they have somewhat of an order. Pieces go from top left to top right, then down a row starting on the left again, and so on. So if you click in an area that would select multiple pieces, whichever one is highest on that priority list will be picked up, even if you clicked mostly on a different piece or didn't want that one. Also, if you drop a piece back in the water it, along with any other pieces it lands on, will sink and respawn in a spot in the water on the left. So the constant movement, piece priority, and sinking situation all make for a very frustrating puzzle experience. There's not really any penalty for these things. It just takes longer and is more frustrating. It wastes your own time and tries your patience, whch I don't think is a good reason to have the elements. The only useful element is that, once you get enough pieces in, you can click on the sun and reveal the entire picture for a few seconds to refresh your memory... even though most people would be able to look at it the while time when doing a real puzzle.On the other hand, there could be MORE elements and it'd make the game more fun, or at least have it make more sense. For instance, maybe something with time. A time limit, or just a timer to record your time. Some type of score for using the piece you grab and taking points away for throwing a piece back. Reasons to go faster and be more precise, plus giving a point to the tedious design. Getting better ranks to unlock perks or just to unlock puzzles. Having online leaderboards to compete for scores or times with others. There are plenty of things that could be added to make the current model of the game make more sense and possibly make it more enjoyable as a video game. Even just a save feature would be nice. In real life, many people will take breaks from big puzzles. Without a save feature, you can't do that here unless you want to leave your game running the entire time, which not everyone wants to do. A few of the puzzles were made up of similar looking things to the point of resorting to random placement to find where anything went. Maybe my eyes just suck, but they were not fun as trial and error challenges. Like the one with all the flowers... my word. Also, most of the puzzles look rather similar to each other anyway, which makes some sense with the common theme of Japan, but I still think more variety could've been had. I only found a few of the pictures interesting to look at and try to solve. What I'm saying is that Pixel Puzzles: Japan falls just a bit short of being a good puzzle simulation, and falls very short of being a fun interactive gaming experience. There needs to be more or less features to make this work well either way, at least for my taste. I played all the way through it, aside from the bonus puzzles. I got all the achievements and did all the main puzzles. I was very worn out near the middle but kept on going to see if it got any different. It really didn't. This game was ten hours of the same thing that, despite doing more puzzles and being a decent amount of puzzles for the price, wasn't a fun experience towards the last half. Changing the elements would make it better and possibly could've made me enjoy this game as a whole. However, I just can't say I enjoyed it. The first few puzzles were fun, but it gets old fast. I got this for free and... as mean as it sounds, I still feel like it was a waste. At least the last half was a waste of my time as I didn't enjoy it, but I wanted to review it and give it a fair chance for reviewing purposes. I feel I've done that, and I honestly cannot recommend it as is, especially at the 7 dollar asking price. Pixel Puzzles: Japan gets a 3/10 for having potential to be a good puzzle simulation or puzzle video game, but failing to do much justice to either camp.			"

												Lots of production value, but bad for jigsaw solving.I've played  bunch of puzzle games (the good ones let you download nice pictures from flickr and do these, so they're basically endless), but none have gone out of their way so much to make this a different experience. Pro: lots of Japanese knick-knacks and animations, very nice feelCon: not suited to jigsaw solving.No save feature (I have that at home doing it on a table, why can't the game save?), pieces that go together don't snap together and have to be moved seperately, and because of this, you basically need to start with the corners and edges because then they'll snap to their final positions. However, good luck finding these in the ""pond"" where the pieces float around instead of waiting to be sorted - and if you have found them that doesn't mean the game will give them to you when you click them.You might decide to bear this for the 21 puzzles that are included, or you might decide to get something better instead. I'll do the latter.[Update: I'm playing this after all for the achievements, and the most aggravating thing by far is that it won't give you the piece you click on half of the time. I still wouldn't recommend playing this.]			"

												Do not recommend. This is not a game for anyone who actually likes puzzles.The pieces that are not being used float around the border in a pond. Endlessly trying to fish out pieces and consistently getting the wrong ones is frustrating. (Or that stupid fish if you're really unlucky) I'm not sure if the person who made this game has put a puzzle together, but that's not really how puzzles work. It would be nice if there was a way to turn off the animation so I can end this simple frustration.In additions, pieces will not stick together on the board. They only stick to the proper place. Meaning, if you found four pieces that go together, tough cookies! You have to wait to find every border piece so you can find the ""spot"" for this thing and put them all in place before they will actually stick together. Again, that's not how puzzles work!While I appreciate having goals, having to do the easy puzzles to get to the hard ones would be just fine if I didn't get motion sickness thanks to the damned pond of pieces. The music got annoying after two puzzles, It's just a few plucks on a koto in an endless loop. Not sure if you unlock different music later, but after a bit this was more grating than relaxing. I gave up.			"

												The pieces keep floating around the edge and when you click on something, the hit box detetction is so poor you just end up getting a random piece.This game would actually have been good if they had just stuck with the usual puzzle layout and allow you to organise your pieces instead of the whole pond and monk thing...

												It's quite amazing that a game about putting together jigsaw puzzles with a zen theme manages to be such a stressful experience.It makes me wonder if the developers ever played with an actual puzzle, as most of the staples of it (ie, looking for patterns among the pieces, setting apart groups of them that seem like they go together, seeing where they fit with the whole picture, leaving the puzzle and going back to it later, etc) are just not possible in this game. Forget about going for specific pieces; you can click all you want on the piece that caught your eye, the game will still give you the piece it thinks you deserve instead. Since they're constantly moving, you'll helplessly watch them drift away from you over and over. The pieces do not `click`, with each other, they just snap to their place on the main grid. So much space on the screen is wasted with useless graphics and blank space that could have been used for much needed game space. The lack of a quick save is a big flaw as well.The pictures are alright, if a bit uninspired and the shapes of the pieces are all nice and varied. The sounds are fine, but they do get grating after a while, especially since it's always the same, over and over.The game is still playable, and you'll barely notice its flaws in the smaller puzzles, but it's all uphill from there. I managed to finish it, but that's mainly because I'm an achievement junkie, more than anything else.			"

TL;DR: A fine jigsaw puzzle game that however gets irritating later on because of the lack of saving feature and unreliable jigsaw piece catching. Pixel Puzzles presents one of the simplest forms of puzzles, jigsaw puzzles, now ported from real life to computer screen. As you'd expect by the subtitle, the theme is Japan. This shows itself both in the puzzles themselves and the interface.In the interface there's a metagame of you being some kind of a Buddhist guru who levels up and becomes ever more enlightened as you solve more puzzles. The puzzles are at first quite easy (i.e. few pieces) but as you ""get more enlightened"" more difficult (i.e. larger) puzzles are unlocked.Puzzle pictures look good and usually contain various temples, parks, cherry trees and castles from the classic Land of the Rising Sun - you won't find anime girls, video game references or weird game shows here, IMO rather unfortunately actually as it would have introduced more variety. Instead, all is serene and beautiful and the music is somewhat relaxing mix in a traditional Japanese style. I frankly muted it after a while and listened to my own music because it was making me sleepy.Gameplay is the important part. The jigsaw pieces are floating in a pond next to the puzzle table and you have to pick them up with mouse cursor. It's sometimes difficult to pick the one you want as the pieces can float over each other and for some reason the one you are pointing with mouse might not be the one picked up - that's rather annoying especially in the larger puzzles where the pieces are smaller.Obviously some simplifications have been taken in the design. The pieces are of fixed orientation, so they never need to be rotated. They also lock in place if you drop them close enough to the intended spot. You also can't see the whole picture but before the puzzle and after gaining enough ""insight"" (i.e. completing large enough part of the puzzle) and then only for a short time. As a minor note, the pieces on the board obscure what's underneath, and once you are close to finishing they might be camouflaged in within the puzzle pattern and there's no way to highlight them for easy notice.In my opinion the major flaw of the game is the lack of saving feature: once you have started a puzzle, you need to complete it or start over again later. This is especially frustrating for the largest puzzles (300-350 pieces) of the end-game as they can take an hour or more to complete. Actually 8 hours of my game time was accumulated when I cracked and left the game running for the night to finish the halfway done last puzzle I started the previous night.Overall I didn't enjoy it very much, but that's not because of it being a bad game but because I grew frustrated when I couldn't progress with the larger puzzles and then couldn't save to continue later. The puzzles are actually quite nice, the jigsaws varied and the challenge is okay. Only in larger puzzles did I get a headache trying to find and the pick the pieces I wanted. In my opinion, there could have been more ""revelations"" of the puzzle picture to speed up the game, and I found the lack of saving horrendous. With that it's a mixed bag with slightly more goodies than ickies.In effect I spend about 15 hours with it completing every puzzle except the very large optional ones. For a patient, casual player it's a good game except for the lack of saving feature. It might even work as a team game, played together with a friend. For a less patient one, perhaps get it on sale or bundle like I did.			"

												The object is simple, grab jigsaw pieces floating in a pond along the top and side edge of the screen and assemble them into a picture in the middle. No timer. No real special abilities or upgrades. No contrived storyline. Just a neat little way to pass some time and look at some pretty pictures.Complexity is added along the way by increasing the piece count of new puzzles or by tackling a picture with fewer unique, easily identifiable features, but the most noticeable addition is the actual ""cut"" of the pieces with each new stage. Initially we're introduced to the more conventional shapes we'd expect to see jigsaw pieces to come in, but as you progress things are mixed up by having the interlocking segments of the pieces cut into shapes relevant to the picture for that puzzle. So, a watery picture might have pieces with interlocking segments in the shape of waves, for example, or another set might have tiny little temples or trees connecting each piece (though no Godzilla shapes are anywhere to be found, sadly). It's a really fresh take on an old formula that manages to hold your interest and keep you guessing for longer than it might have otherwise, but thankfully this really helps it to stand out.Another factor which makes it stand out is its presentation. Everything is presented with an air of tranquillity, from the constant gentle twangs of various Japanese string instruments, to the flow and splashing of water throughout that makes you want to go to the toilet at least once every puzzle set. Visually, there's no great flare or anything flashy going on, everything is clean and simple and in keeping with the overall style and tone of the game helping it make for a sedate and pleasant experience.During my time with the 21 puzzles (19 regular, unlockable sets, and 2 ""bonus"" sets that are unlocked from the beginning but don't seem to count towards overall progress, oddly), I only found myself having any difficulty with two of the sets, which was partly down to the finale's piece count, but also the lack of distinct features on their pictures, which is one of the few minor complaints I'd have with the game. I know that the colours and shapes in each picture scene has to be kept relatively similar throughout, otherwise you'd find every piece way too easily, but that doesn't mean the images have to be uninteresting. It would have been nice to assemble something that was a greater showcase of Japan and its culture, like pedestrians crossing the Shibuya intersection or some talking toilets or a schoolgirl underwear vending machine. But, instead, we have to be content with some temples or golf courses. Which are OK... I guess.Another minor gripe I had with it was the lack of a save feature. This isn't a problem for the easier early stages, but towards the end I could see it being a real issue for some as you might want to put an hour or so aside for a couple of the later, harder sets. Another, more pressing pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ though, was actually selecting the pieces from the pond. Again, this isn't so much a concern at the start, but by the end the pond is so full of moving pieces that grabbing one out of it becomes a real problem, to the extent that more often than not the piece I clicked on wouldn't be what came out and I'd appear to have some near by random piece instead, with me having to remove all the unwanted surrounding pieces before finally being able to get the one I wanted. A really strange oversight in an otherwise well made game.So, while it's not without its flaws, overall I really enjoyed my time with it. Full disclosure, I got the game free as part of a promotion on a bundle site, but even had I paid full price I'd still be happy with it. So if you've got a bit of spare time, a little patience, and some extra money to blow on a throwaway purchase, then I could easily point you towards this game to satisfy your crazy, insatiable jigsaw lust.

												Little Disclaimer: I got this game in a bundle, so I didn't buy full price for it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game at full price.The reason is rather simple: This game fails on almost every level.It is supposed to be a jigsaw puzzle game, yet the engine is seriously flawed:  You cannot attach pieces to each other even if you know they fit. You can only fix them to their final position. This makes it ""kind of"" easy to solve every puzzle: Choose a position, drag every puzzle piece to that position until one fits. Rinse and repeat. When several pieces are on top of each other, it seem to be pure randomness which one is selected by clicking. It may be the bottom-most one. It never is ""the one visible that I want to click"". Sometimes you have to shovel several pieces away from one position to finally select the one you want. The ""pond"" is a nice idea, it's implementation however heavily collides with the idea of a relaxing jigsaw puzzle game. Instead of having a quiet atmosphear, there always is something moving. The form of the pond (at least on my resolution) results in pieces cluttering on one side of the screen. As all pieces swim, I sometimes had to ""hunt"" a piece along the screen: It always tried to ""hide"" beneath other ones yet the one selected on click was a different one. The kai was disturbing as well but at least that could be removed (see achievements). The other puzzle game from the developers hints that they have a very strange idea about what relaxing jigsaw puzzle games should look like... There is no area to sort pieces. When for real puzzles, you might want to sort ""border pieces"" or ""blue pieces"" to one stack, you can only heap them up on the playing area, here. You might consider using the pond but every piece thrown into the pond changes location. Not only does it flow away over time; it immediately is put to a random place when dropped. This also is very frustrating when ""digging"" for a single piece by throwing everything else back into the pond: You easily throw away the desired piece on accident and then it's hard to find again.  I've played freeware puzzle games that allowed to customize the puzzles (choose your own picture, choose number of pieces). This game does not support any of this. When even the addition of new puzzles is worth an update post, there's something seriously wrong with the engine.The puzzles themselves were not too bad although I sometimes thought they were missing contrast to tell the pieces apart from each other. Most later puzzles I solved with a lot of the ""Rinse and Repeat""-tactic. The music bored me to hell but may seem relaxing to some. Still, the most positive thing I can say about this game is that it's rather easy to achieve 100% completion on it. You don't need any skill, just some time.			"

												A jigsaw puzzle game for when you're mellow and you just want to chill out.This is a very casual game. Not much to it, merely a puzzle game with a Japanese theme.As you progress, the puzzles have more pieces but that's the only challenge the game will pose.Want more of a challenge? Consider Pixel Puzzles: UndeadZ			"

												It’s a total disaster. What do you need for assembling a jigsaw puzzle? 1, a big table to group puzzle by type/color2, a safe places to store you workIt’s just that simple. However, this game fail on both conditions.1, the puzzle pieces keep floating around. There’s no way to group the puzzle properly. I just finished the 350 pieces puzzle and it looked disgusting. To make thing even worst, the click detection was poorly designed.  It feels like you are playing FPS game after a drinking contest. Everythins is moving. You miss, you miss and you miss.2. No save in this game. What are they thinking? It was not fun doing a 300 pieces puzzle non-stop.For jigsaw puzzle lover, do not buy it. Save you time and money.			"

												Little Disclaimer: I got this game in a bundle, so I didn't buy full price for it. I wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this game at full price.The reason is rather simple: This game fails on almost every level.It is supposed to be a jigsaw puzzle game, yet the engine is seriously flawed:  You cannot attach pieces to each other even if you know they fit. You can only fix them to their final position. This makes it ""kind of"" easy to solve every puzzle: Choose a position, drag every puzzle piece to that position until one fits. Rinse and repeat. When several pieces are on top of each other, it seem to be pure randomness which one is selected by clicking. It may be the bottom-most one. It never is ""the one visible that I want to click"". Sometimes you have to shovel several pieces away from one position to finally select the one you want. The ""pond"" is a nice idea, it's implementation however heavily collides with the idea of a relaxing jigsaw puzzle game. Instead of having a quiet atmosphear, there always is something moving. The form of the pond (at least on my resolution) results in pieces cluttering on one side of the screen. As all pieces swim, I sometimes had to ""hunt"" a piece along the screen: It always tried to ""hide"" beneath other ones yet the one selected on click was a different one. The kai was disturbing as well but at least that could be removed (see achievements). The other puzzle game from the developers hints that they have a very strange idea about what relaxing jigsaw puzzle games should look like... There is no area to sort pieces. When for real puzzles, you might want to sort ""border pieces"" or ""blue pieces"" to one stack, you can only heap them up on the playing area, here. You might consider using the pond but every piece thrown into the pond changes location. Not only does it flow away over time; it immediately is put to a random place when dropped. This also is very frustrating when ""digging"" for a single piece by throwing everything else back into the pond: You easily throw away the desired piece on accident and then it's hard to find again.  I've played freeware puzzle games that allowed to customize the puzzles (choose your own picture, choose number of pieces). This game does not support any of this. When even the addition of new puzzles is worth an update post, there's something seriously wrong with the engine.The puzzles themselves were not too bad although I sometimes thought they were missing contrast to tell the pieces apart from each other. Most later puzzles I solved with a lot of the ""Rinse and Repeat""-tactic. The music bored me to hell but may seem relaxing to some. Still, the most positive thing I can say about this game is that it's rather easy to achieve 100% completion on it. You don't need any skill, just some time.			"

												This game would be pretty fun, but once you get to a certain puzzle size, you can't even pick up the pieces you want because of the stupid implementation.  The main problems are:1) When there are multiple puzzle pieces layered over each other, the one you pick up isn't the one that's on the top.  It should definitely be the one on the top, as the way it is now you don't ever know what piece you're getting.2) When you place a piece back into the pool of pieces, they all spawn in the same place on the left.  So all the pieces tend to congregate in one place after a while.  When you combine this with point #1, it makes it impossible to pick up the piece you want.  The returned pieces should spawn where you placed them in the pool, or even just in a random place.The bad UI isn't such a big deal in the earlier puzzles since there are less pieces, but the game is nearly unplayable after a certain point.

												As someone who loves doing physical jigsaw puzzles, I looked forward to digging into this game. While it is a gorgeous aesthetic, the shifting flow of pieces around the board was incredibly annoying to me. I organize my physical puzzles by color and the inability to have any organization or structure made the game much less enjoyable. Plus it was very difficult to selevt what piece you wanted. While the music was good, there is only one track while you're working on puzzles and one track while in the menu as I recall, and that gets incredibly repetitive when you're spending 20+ minutes on a puzzle. There are also only 19 puzzles, and I finished this game in a couple days. I would really give this game a neutral rating if that was an choice, but with how grating the music was and the incessant annoyance of finding the piece I wanted, I had to go with the negative option.

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan offers an interesting twist on the traditional Jigsaw puzzle without the hassle of finding out that you are missing pieces. Things start off very calm but as the pieces multiply the challenge increases considerably. The constantly moving puzzle pieces also make it tricky, but there is no time limit to worry about. About the only annoyance is that you cannot save your progress during a puzzle.			"

												The only reason to buy this game is that Pixel Puzzles are the only jigsaw puzzle games on Steam. I do love jigsaw puzzles. I solved all the content in this game in <10 hours. Puzzles range from 100-350 pieces.Problems:- Clicking on a stack of pieces almost never selects the piece that is rendered on top of the others; this is frustrating in the extreme.- No ability to rotate pieces.- Cannot link pieces that connect and move them as a group.- Does not remember my Music and SFX settings (i.e. ""Stay off, grr!""). Music and SFX are distracting not relaxing.- The koi is outright annoying.			"

												The object is simple, grab jigsaw pieces floating in a pond along the top and side edge of the screen and assemble them into a picture in the middle. No timer. No real special abilities or upgrades. No contrived storyline. Just a neat little way to pass some time and look at some pretty pictures.Complexity is added along the way by increasing the piece count of new puzzles or by tackling a picture with fewer unique, easily identifiable features, but the most noticeable addition is the actual ""cut"" of the pieces with each new stage. Initially we're introduced to the more conventional shapes we'd expect to see jigsaw pieces to come in, but as you progress things are mixed up by having the interlocking segments of the pieces cut into shapes relevant to the picture for that puzzle. So, a watery picture might have pieces with interlocking segments in the shape of waves, for example, or another set might have tiny little temples or trees connecting each piece (though no Godzilla shapes are anywhere to be found, sadly). It's a really fresh take on an old formula that manages to hold your interest and keep you guessing for longer than it might have otherwise, but thankfully this really helps it to stand out.Another factor which makes it stand out is its presentation. Everything is presented with an air of tranquillity, from the constant gentle twangs of various Japanese string instruments, to the flow and splashing of water throughout that makes you want to go to the toilet at least once every puzzle set. Visually, there's no great flare or anything flashy going on, everything is clean and simple and in keeping with the overall style and tone of the game helping it make for a sedate and pleasant experience.During my time with the 21 puzzles (19 regular, unlockable sets, and 2 ""bonus"" sets that are unlocked from the beginning but don't seem to count towards overall progress, oddly), I only found myself having any difficulty with two of the sets, which was partly down to the finale's piece count, but also the lack of distinct features on their pictures, which is one of the few minor complaints I'd have with the game. I know that the colours and shapes in each picture scene has to be kept relatively similar throughout, otherwise you'd find every piece way too easily, but that doesn't mean the images have to be uninteresting. It would have been nice to assemble something that was a greater showcase of Japan and its culture, like pedestrians crossing the Shibuya intersection or some talking toilets or a schoolgirl underwear vending machine. But, instead, we have to be content with some temples or golf courses. Which are OK... I guess.Another minor gripe I had with it was the lack of a save feature. This isn't a problem for the easier early stages, but towards the end I could see it being a real issue for some as you might want to put an hour or so aside for a couple of the later, harder sets. Another, more pressing pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ though, was actually selecting the pieces from the pond. Again, this isn't so much a concern at the start, but by the end the pond is so full of moving pieces that grabbing one out of it becomes a real problem, to the extent that more often than not the piece I clicked on wouldn't be what came out and I'd appear to have some near by random piece instead, with me having to remove all the unwanted surrounding pieces before finally being able to get the one I wanted. A really strange oversight in an otherwise well made game.So, while it's not without its flaws, overall I really enjoyed my time with it. Full disclosure, I got the game free as part of a promotion on a bundle site, but even had I paid full price I'd still be happy with it. So if you've got a bit of spare time, a little patience, and some extra money to blow on a throwaway purchase, then I could easily point you towards this game to satisfy your crazy, insatiable jigsaw lust.

												Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a couple of terrible projecting misconceptions, leading to creation of playable game - but only if you are really obstinate to complete it. This game is a typical jigsaw puzzle, rarely found on steam (if not unique). It includes around 20 different images. As suggested, all of them are japanese-themed. So, you complete puzzles, and by this you level up this tiny monk in bottom-left corner, from acolyte to someone who looks as if was abducted by aliens. Higher monk levels unlock more challenging puzzles, and he levels up when you complete all but one pictures from tier. Actual game is simple: pick piece from the pond and move it to right location, where it will be automatically locked. While regular jigsaw puzzles allow you to see the complete picture - here it's a bonus. You unlock a glance at the picture by placing pieces in correct locations. Unfortunately - even in the biggest puzzles you can use it 2-3 times.Stated at the beginning - this game is a collection of terrible projecting misconceptions. Firstly - while not a problem at smaller puzzles, try picking specified piece on more difficult ones. It's literally impossible. If the pieces are in swarm (and in this tiny pond they are almost all the time), game picks not the one you selected, but one closer to left top corner (this leads to exploit - check guides at game hub for more info on this). Second thing that bothered me terribly - game settings restart after you turn off the game. It's pain in the butt - mute the game (as the soundtrack and effects are quite annoying) everytime you play. Finally, due to limited access to big picture - some puzzles have to be completed by trying to fit each piece in every place (like in picture with cherry blooms).To sum up, this game is a great example of production with wasted potential. Jigsaw puzzles are scarce on Steam, so it's a shame that game like this is done so badly. Good things? If you try really hard, you may have fun. Plus, achievements are pretty easy to get - completing the game gives you all of them.			"

												Most annoying part of this game is actually seeing and picking up the pieces in that stupid pond gimmick. It takes several clicks just to pick up the piece you want because it seems to always pick some other piece that was nowhere near where you click. It's okay for the easier levels, but when you start getting much finer pieces it just becomes incredibly annoying.You cannot lock correct pieces together - they only lock on to the board when they're in the correct position. This puzzle game is more annoying than relaxing.			"

It can also sometimes be pain in the a*s to pick up pieces because they are ,,floating"" on water. If you have alot of patience, then this is for you. But i can't recommend something that is ,,unbeatable"".

												Frustration simulator 2014. I'd rather be catching flies in chopsticks! The pieces move around the board - why the hell do they move? - and when I try to select a piece it'll pick up one that was nowhere near it. This was near-unplayable, far from the relaxing chill-out-before-bed kind of game I was hoping for. Who doesn't love jigsaw puzzles to relax and while away some time in the evening? But this.. the chill music became an addition to the extreme annoyance, taunting me with its calm. Been a long time since achievements felt so much like achievements, and such a reminder that I've wasted hours of my life trying to convince the game to let me pick up the piece I want.Absolute crap, avoid like peeing on a samurai.

												The game isn't bad, but it's definitely not great. For being a game that is supposed to be 'zen', it has some features that make it pretty frustrating, particularly when doing puzzles with more pieces. At first, the game starts out being pretty relaxing, but as the game continues, the pieces floating around get smaller and smaller. This makes it hard to see what's on them sometimes, but that wouldn't be a problem in itself. The main problem is that once there gets to be more pieces, it's incredibly difficult to get the piece you actually want, especially before it floats under another clump of pieces. Even if the piece is on top, it feels like more often than not, whenever you click, it will select a random piece from within a centimeter or so radius. And forget about just dropping the piece and trying again - when you drop a piece, it takes itself and all the pieces around it back to the single spawn point in the water for the pieces. Soon, all the pieces will be all clustered together there and you'll basically just need to pile all the pieces up on your playing board if you want any of them, espeically a specific one. It would be nice to be able to actually select only the piece you are clicking on. It would also be very helpful not to have a piece go back to the spawn point when setting it down and have it actually stay where you set it. The ability to turn off the floating of the pieces would also be useful, particularly once they get pretty small. Another feature that this game is lacking that I've seen on free puzzle games is the ability for pieces to 'stick' to their neighboring pieces. Basically in this game, pieces only lock into place on the actual board. Even if you find two pieces that obviously go together but don't know where to put them yet, they will stay as separate pieces. It would be really nice if the pieces could click together and then be moved together. Maybe the developers didn't want to include this feature on purpose and I could see where having large chunks of pieces already stuck together would clutter up the board, but maybe it could be a feature that players could choose to turn on or off. Despite these annoying flaws, the game still does have some pros, including nice pictures and pretty neat edge styles that vary from puzzle to puzzle. It is a fun game, but it would be a lot less of a headache with the addition of the features I mentioned earlier. Because of the problems and the shortness of the game, I would have to NOT recomend the game at it's full price - $7 is too much when there are plenty of free puzzle games on other sites. If the game is ever on sale for $4 or less, then I would recommend picking it up if you're interested.			"

It has its share of drawbacks, though:1) Taking a piece out of the koi pond may be frustrating and their movement is confusing;2) Puzzle pieces are bound to the board - you can randomly drop a piece on its right place, but you can't connect them before that. Kinda silly, but doesn't really ruin the experience.I got it for free on indiegala giveaway, so I'm not sure if It's worth its price. But I enjoyed it and I'm sure other people who like jigsaw puzzles will do as well.			"

												Don't let the reviews fool you. This is not a good puzzle game.GOODThe puzzle pieces differ in size and shape from typical pieces. This adds a lot of variety to how connecting pieces can be approached.NEUTRALThe music is ok, but repetitive. Some of the sounds get annoying after a while.The art is mediocre and overrated.BADAlmost everything related to the 'river' system. A river containing all of the puzzle pieces runs along the outside edges of the board. The pieces float about in the river and are supposed to disperse throughout. The problem with this system is that pieces will often overlap and cover each other, making it impossible to find the piece that you're looking for. Grabbing and dropping a piece in the river will return it to an area at the left, instead of where you drop it. This can cause it to become buried under other pieces if accidentally dropped. It also causes cluttering around that area of the river, making it even harder to find pieces.Clicking seems to be a bit inaccurate. Clicking directly on a piece in the river will sometimes grab a nearby piece instead of the one you wanted.Picking a piece from the river will sometimes grab multiple pieces from the river. If this happens, all pieces are immediately dropped and returned to the left side of the river.The distribution of pieces throughout the river is extremely bad because of the above issues. The left side will always have all of the pieces while the top right will have only a handful.Pieces are placed into the puzzle by location, rather than by connecting them to one another. Finding two pieces that fit together effectively does nothing because they can't be connected, and leaving them on the board where they won't float covers up the locations. Returning them back to the river presents the issue of having to find the matching piece(s) again. This limits the number of strategies available for solving the puzzles and adds artificial difficulty. "

												First impression of this game was very good. Nice puzzles. But after a while the controls are getting really annoying. The pieces are floating around the board and are constantly overlapping each other. This won't be a big problem if there are few pieces. But while you progress the pieces per puzzle are increasing, but not the space where they are floating around.In the last puzzles I couldn't pick a specific piece but got a random piece.Sadly there are some bugs. For example when you pick up a piece and drop it on another piece the will reset all to a ""spawn point"". Too bad if you teleport your piece away which you tried to reach.Another bug apears, when the pieces are floating around for a while. Especially when there are a huge amount of pieces. The get stuck. This sound nice, because you might pick them up easier. But they also stack while the are stuck. So you might not find your missing piece ;)Too bad you can't turn off the floating. A level editor to add own images would be nice. And if the pieces wouldn't be oriented correctly would give a new challenge to the puzzles. But only if you can pick up the piece you want to.Due to the bugs and frustration I only recommend it to you if you are patient. 5/10			"

												For small puzzles, this can be an entertaining enough time waster.  Unfortunately, the game has two major issues.First, puzzles are easy.  There is no piece rotation, which makes it rather obvious where pieces will go.  The distance that you can be off when you place a piece is rather forgiving, making it easy to place pieces by guessing.Second, the user interface is fatally flawed when playing larger puzzles, to a degree that large puzzles are exercises in frustration where you often simply cannot pick up the piece that you actually desire to pick up.  Unplaced pieces float in a pool around the board, and with large puzzles you have large clumps of numerous pieces.  The fatal flaw is that piece selection does not appear to be based on what the screen shows, and it appears to be nearly (if not entirely) impossible to pick up certain pieces if others are nearby.  One would think that the game would grab the top piece under the cursor, but it often doesn't.  Not only will it often refuse to grab the top piece of an overlapping stack, sometimes it appears to vacuum in nearby pieces that aren't even under the cursor.  You can know exactly which piece you want to pick up, but find it impossible to actually get the game to pick it up.			"

												I am not sure about this downvote, because it still has some good points. Let's reviem them :It has a nice, relaxing soundtrack (however, it may stopfor no reason at any given time, and restart a few seconds later).Pieces have varied and interesting forms, and images to reform are great.Scaling difficulty (up to 350 pieces for the last one)And there are the flaws :The first, major flaw is the reason for my downvote : you may have noticed the moving pieces around the board. It is supposed to bring interactivity in the game. The reality is there, however. It is a hassle to find each piece, when you have found it, it is hard to follow and nearly impossible to pick (when you click on it, you pick a random near piece, the only way i have found is to isolate my piece (while it's moving) and then grab it). This problem intensifies as you go on to harder puzzles and the number of pieces increases. This functionality should be possible to disable, because it makes the whole experience frustrating.My last complain concerns the model of the puzzle. Instead of having a small window showing the complete puzzle (where you could, for example, zoom on it), you have a ""power"" which, when ready, will show you the model (superposed to the board), for a brief instant. Then, it disappears, and you're again missing it.To sum up, it's not actually a bad game, but it is a frustrating experience for one who, like me, is fond of jigsaw puzzles, thus, I don't recommend it, except if you would enjoy hunting (literally) for your pieces. However, the lack of good jigsaw puzzles on computer is the real ace for this game which contains 15 (or so) puzzles.			"

												Pixel Puzzles lets you put pieces on a board until they form a picture, but fails to deliver a worthwhile jigsaw experience. Why? Well, two reasons, mostly.Firstly, the game doesn't care if you find two connecting pieces and put them together, which is how I (and most people) usually go about completing a jigsaw. Instead, it only cares if you put a piece in it's correct position on the picture, because yes, I absolutely knew that random piece went in that exact spot when it's closest neighbours are 6 pieces away.Secondly, while I actually like the little pond with pieces floating around, constantly shuffling, the fact that 9 times out of 10, I can't just click on the piece I want and actually get it, rather than another piece floating in the area, is extremely frustrating.Due to these two glaring design flaws, I cannot recommend this game. I'm sure there are some people who will be satisfied with it, but I'm also sure there are far better alternatives out there.			"

												Most of my favorite games are action packed shooters filled with explosions and many different guns and complex role playing games with tons of story and dialog to become immersed in. So why do I recommend this game? For one point really: it's highly relaxing.Sometimes I want to just sit back, relax, and enjoy a game and maybe work my brain a little too. This game does just that. I got this game for free over at the IndieGala website, and when I first downloaded it, I didn't expect to like it at all, but I was completely wrong. I load up this game after a long day at school or doing homework for hours on end. It's a great way to escape stress and just let go. Most games I play require my full attention and for me to constantly be doing something. With no timer, Pixel Puzzles: Japan lets to solve beautiful puzzles centered around famous Japanese monuments and landscapes at your own pace.While the game is fairly simplistic, there are a few minor complaints. The first would be the higher level puzzles. As you progress, puzzle pieces become more and more strange. They're not your ordinary jigsaw pieces anymore, they're abstractly cut and hard to piece together. One way you can solve this is by starting with the sides and corners first.Second, and it is a small minor complaint, but I don't like how the pieces float around so much. I understand that they move around to make you have to look for them more, but I wish it was just a little bit slower. Anyways, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing and simple game to help take stress away from their lives. Sit back, grab a nice beverage and enjoy this wonderful little title, Pixel Puzzles: Japan.			"

												This game serves as a great time waster and offers good brain exorcise. It's quite nice and relaxing from the music to the subtle background sounds. Being a Japanese oriented game and being a big fan of Japanese culture myself, this earned extra points in my book. The puzzels can range from simple to difficult and offers enough challenge and content to have you sitting for hours on end. But of course this game isn't for everyone. It requires patience, the affinity towards jigsaw puzzles, and the ability to sit and focus. I can imagine this game wouldn't appeal towards those with who have bad attention/hyperactivity disorder. This is simply a game that works wonders when waiting and wasting time. I highly recommend this title and believe it's worth the price tag.			"

												This game doesn't manage to ruin the fun of putting jigsaw puzzles together, but it comes close with some terrible design choices:- When you place a piece in the correct spot, it locks in place... even if it's not connected to any neighboring pieces and it was just dump luck that you placed it there. This really kills your feeling of actually having any skill. There's also no visual indicator of which pieces are locked in their correct position, and which still need to be placed.- Pieces are ALWAYS oriented correctly with the puzzle. They never rotate.- If you find matching pieces, but don't know where they fit on the board yet, you can't keep them snapped together. You can't even put them beside each other somewhere out of the way, because there IS no ""out of the way"" area.- All the loose pieces move around in a koi pond beside the puzzle. You can take pieces out of the pond, but the only place to put them is on the puzzle board itself.- You can't just look at the box to see what the finished puzzle looks like. You have to correctly place a bunch of pieces to earn a five second glimpse of the finished puzzle.			"

												The game is fun but also frustating on the same time.Music pops up every 10 secons and plays for 5 seconds. Which is very annoying.Puzzle pieces moves and goes over a different puzzle piece, which makes it very difficult to pick it up.If you try to pick a puzzle piece there is a high chance that you pick a different one instead.Only reason that this is time consuming is because you can not pickup the correct puzzle piece.Also you can just pickup a Puzzle piece and place it on the field and it might be ""Correct"", Even if it is impossible to know where the puzzle piece has to be and even when ur entire field is empty.Achievements are not achievements. its just Level completion achievement.I do not recommend this game at all. Rating: 2/10			"

												Edit:  I turned the game on today and all of my progress is gone.  As it is right now, I would not receommend this game.This is a great game!  I really enjoy it.  My only complaint is the implementation of the moving puzzle pieces.  When there are a lot of pieces in one place and I try to pick up the piece that is on *top* of all of them, I instead get all of the pieces *under* it.  This is very, very frustrating.  Please fix this.  Otherwise, I love it!			"

												Pixel Puzzles is exactly what it looks like: a jigsaw puzzle game.  Unused pieces float around the top and left of the puzzle in an appropriately-themed koi pond until you grab them and place them in the puzzle.  All pieces are oriented correctly with no rotation function.  Pieces will lock into place when close enough to their correct location no matter if adjacent pieces are in place or not.  Pieces will not lock together when not already placed in the correct location in the puzzle.Puzzles increase in difficulty as you progress through the game by increasing the complexity of the image and the number of pieces in the puzzle.  In the later puzzles the pond is so packed with pieces it's very difficult to locate a specific one and I took to just dragging random pieces out onto the board.  Each puzzle has different shapes for pieces and some of them make it very obvious when two pieces fit together.There is one large problem with the game however.  When picking up pieces, the game has a really nasty habit of picking up any piece EXCEPT the one you actually clicked on.  I've clicked on a piece that was completely alone in the pond and had the game grab one an inch away instead.  It gets quite frustrating seeing a piece and not being able to grab it before it floats off to get lost in the jumble of other pieces again.Despite that one major flaw, it's a competent jigsaw puzzle game which I don't believe there are many of on Steam.  I'd rate it an ""indifferent"" if I could.			"

												Easy achievements to get, yet challenging to get the right piece from the creek. Can't always start out getting all the corner pieces, just have to get any pieces that are easily recognizable from any corner pieces you could gather and go from there.The only downside is that you can't save your progress, once you start a puzzle you have to finish the puzzle, which could be an issue for tier 3+ puzzles that has a lot of pieces and smaller.Still each puzzle is different with their own pattern, along with two extra puzzles that you don't need to solve (nor for the achievements).Good for puzzle lovers.-----Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:BluePaw's Underrated Games ListJoin and/or follow if you wish.

												Does this one fit here? Nope. This one? Nope. How about this one? Nope. This? No. That? No. That one over there? NOPE! ...and this one? N.O.P.E. .... THIS ONE MUST BE THE CORRECT ONE. NOPE! They said puzzles were fun and relaxing. Well... they were wrong. This games becomes tiresome and boring fast. You have to complete the puzzle in one go. You can't resume half-done puzzle. Piece detection is abysmal. To make things worse all pieces are floating on the sides and above the picture makin search for the correct piece difficult. It's even harder to catch the correct piece as detection is horrible... Oh, I mientioned that before. It's so bad you often end up clicking 15+ times to get the desired piece. Some pictures are just stupid (flowers on the surface of the water - evey piece looks the same) or blurry (woods, walls) and it's hard to distinguish one from another.The fun part ends soon and you end up in 40+minutes of trial and error wishing it was over. I don't recommend.Piece you!			"

A Screenshot of Pixel Puzzles: Japan
By: Bogor Represent!




Pixel Puzzles is a nice jig-saw simulator. It has a wide range of puzzles with pastoral scenes of rural to ancient Japan that individually range from ho-hum to downright beautiful. The puzzles go from 'easy' 60pieces to what I would call 'journeyman' 250pieces.The setting is weirdly enough chinese... As you solve a puzzle, a chinese monk is pondering the I-ching and as you successfully place the pieces of your puzzle, he achieves enlightenment which gives you the chance to tap into this enlightenment to see a representation of the completed puzzle.The puzzle difficulty is tiered and you only unlock the next tier by levelling up your monk which you achieve by completing a set number of puzzles in a given tier. The way it is set up gives the impression that you can go your own way, but the only freedom you have is by deciding which puzzle in a tier you want to do first.The puzzle-screen is workmanlike and efficient, which I like. The screen's layout successfully focuses your attention to the part where you work on your puzzle. There's no information on the screen that can grab your attention away from the puzzle. No weird animated stuff, no dancing gibbies, no unasked for anime-crap (which the developers could easily have fallen for, I admire their restraint.).The music is light and unintrusive, though I must echo the complaints about the waterdrip garden-ornament. I never experienced the old sound-effect as it was patched before I bought Pixel Puzzles: Japan, but it still serves to shatter my concentration now and then. I would like to see an option to disable/enable the waterdrip garden-ornament so that players who don't want the sound-effect can play the game without it.Bordering the puzzle-table is a koi-pond in which the pieces float around. I guess the idea is that the player is rummaging around in there with their hands to grab a piece. I think it's a fun idea, but it doesn't translate well once in the game and trying to fish out the piece that you want can be a source of mild annoyance.Though the developers did went the extra mile here. For a cute laugh, catch the Koi and drop it on the puzzle-table. ^^The actual completing of the jig-saws is fundamentally flawed though. The pieces don't snap together, but they individually snap to the grid. This means that you can't make clusters like you can when you piece together a real jig-saw. I think that this is a glaring oversight.Secondly, it makes it extremely easy to cheese completion of a jig-saw as you can move a random piece around until it snaps in place, made even easier because the snap-to-grid mechanic is very forgiving. I have oftenly seen that I pushed a random piece aside only to have it snap to the grid!Another thing that missed the intended goal I guess is the form of the pieces. Though the developers probably thought that the sometimes outlandish shapes would make the puzzles harder, (did they recognize the problem with the snap-to-grid action too?), it actually achieves the opposite. I oftenly found myself looking for a specific shape rather than trying to find a piece that graphically matched the picture. The weird shapes make it too easy to piece together the bane of every jig-saw fanatic; large sections of clear blue sky.There is no scoring in Pixel Puzzles so completing a puzzle without using the monk's enlightenment goes unrewarded. Pixel Puzzles further does not block the computer from falling asleep, or to start the screensaver. Pixel Puzzler also doesn't believe in tooltips so it isn't readily clear what a button does unless you click on it to find out.While I do like the game an sich, as it does exactly what it says on the tin and nothing more or less, which with today's games is somewhat of a blessing as it has been a while since I've bought a game that did what is promised, I dislike the fact that when it comes to piecing together a jig-saw, Pixel Puzzler fails. The snap-to-grid action as opposed to fitting pieces together, coupled with the fact that with the weird shapes the piecing together is nothing but a 'find the weird shape that fits another weird shape affair', works to render the game alltogether too easy and robs the player of a challenge.Still a fun game that provides a good diversion and most certainly not overpriced. But it fails where it matters and that's a shame.			"

												A very pretty, well done puzzle game with a few quirks.quirk one:  you have to litterally ""fish"" your puzzle peices out of the moat around the board.  Yes, you can catch the fish.  No, you cannot catch the lily pads.  Yes, you can put the fish into the water feature in the bottom left corner of the screen.quirk 2:  This one did bother me a bit.  There is no ""save"" feature.  If you do not finish a puzzle, but close it, you will have to start that puzzle all over again.  This was not an issue on the smaller puzzles at the beginning, but the later ones take a while.  I ended up leaving the game up and running errands and then picking it back up when I came home.....This is still a recommended game and it was a very nice change of pace.			"

												Please, don't do THIS GAME to me. I'm a veteran puzzler, and also love Japan, but this game is a NO-NO.  - Simple overall opinion: IT'S VERY ANNOYING INSTEAD OF RELAXING o_o - Do not have saving option - Hard to click an exact puzzle in the pond - Belonging pieces don't stuck to each other - The interface is the same as the browser flash game Sushi Sudoku (search for it!)Please don't sell this game for money. People will buy it accidentaly. But I also have to admit that the Koi is cute.			"

												A decent puzzle building game. I love doing puzzles but this one just seemed to bore me after getting through about 10 of them. I didn't like that you had to complete each puzzle in one sitting. You can't put half the puzzle together and save the rest for later. It will reset the puzzle if you go back to main menu. I can really only recommend this if you like some ok pictures of Japan  and really love puzzles to the extreme.			"

												Too easy and way too few puzzles. By doing each puzzle once, you get all the achievements (except 1, which is VERY easy to figure out), which is the only reason I bothered finishing it. Grab it on some sale if you like jigsaws, else don't bother - not expensive at full price, but too expensive for what you get.Btw, there's one big problem with this one:There's a small area where all your pieces moves around constantly. When there's a lot of pieces there, you'll rarely be able to get the one you're pointing at, without removing most others first. That gets extremely annoying very fast.			"

												Let's set things straight: the game itself is a fine, simple, jigsaw puzzle game with a terrible, horribly frustrating addition. I'm unsure wether this is a regional tradition, or just a cruel joke on people who just want to get things done such as myself, but apparently the damn puzzle pieces flow in a river stream. A. River. Stream.So, whenever you set your eyes on the damn piece you've been looking for since the beginning of the puzzle, it WILL end up being either submerged, or dragged in a larger clump of pieces. Is this bad for everyone? Not sure. Is it making me wish i could drown myself in the rriver for the sake of never ever being forced to fish up pieces ever again? You bet.""C'mon man, it can't be all this bad"" you might say... Of course you never tried to get ahold of THAT single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of puzzle for 2 minutes straight, as your mouse pointer hovers over it giggling at your feeble attempts. Because, of course, even if you're pointing the piece you want as if you were an italian pointer dog, it WILL fail. Repeatedly.If the whole point of the game is supposed to be relaxation and patience, may I say it fails kind of hard in both regards. Even the music, which is kind of interesting to listen to at first gets kind of unnerving after a few rounds of ""catch the ducking piece"" enchancing the whole ""i hope this damn stream explodes and just leaves the damn pieces lying around the board"" sensation.Ah, and ""dulcis in fundu"", you don't even get a damn clue on what the final image will look like ingame, so have fun trying to figure out where each piece belongs based purely on INSTINCT and, idk, supernatural powers of farseeing.I won't say anything about the puzzle selection menu, which is a game per se, in which the sole objective is to START THE GAME because I can't muster enough strength to bash it as well.I got this game for free, as a gift, and at first i did believe it was a gesture of friendship. Now i know i've got a mortal enemy out there, keeping an eye out for me, taking adavantage of my weak points.			"

												The jigsaw puzzle aspect of the puzzle is nice, but it has many technical issues.Sound is awful and scratchy. Settings will not be saved. When you click on a pile of pieces, you never get the one you want, but a random piece from 2cm away. You barely have any space to ""manage"" your pieces.And I actually managed to ""lose"" a piece.. (was lying somewhere on the board, blended in perfectly..)I got this game for 70 cents or so, it kept me entertained for a decent amount of time. Once you get over the technicaal issues it is kind of fun. Not worth 7 euros though, in my opinion. I got technically better games for free on my tablet..			"

												After about 7 hours and a half in this game I think I can write a proper review for it. It has both bad and good things but it's not unplayable, despite it's flaws.At first it was really fun, but as you play more and more you start to observe the problems with this game. And they are annoying: 1°) Lack of a save feature (last puzzle has 350 pieces and it took me about an hour to complete). If you are not patient enough, this game is not for you. You could Alt+Tab the game and do something else as a break from the puzzle, but I wouldn't do that to much (in the past I had some problems with some games on steam where I couldn't Alt+Tab because that would break the game).2°) The music is kind of nice, but it becames repetitive quite fast. You could try to mute it, but that would mute all sounds of the game and there is a little click sound when you place a piece in the right place which I found quite useful.3°) The images are nice, but have too many similar colors and aren't in HiRes. As the puzzles had more and more pieces it became quite hard to find the exact place where one piece would fit. It's even harder if you have a small screen (I played mine on a laptop and it was very painful and it placed a lot of strain on my eyes). The fact that it doesn't show you a big picture of what the puzzle should look like it doesn't help at all. It does have a little ""hint"" thing where it shows you the picture for a few seconds, but it puts the pieces over the actual picture and when you have many correct pieces it became even harder to find where you should put the other pieces (you can move the pieces normal when this ""hint"" it's activated). The ""hint"" button is charged at random when you place pieces correctly; you need 8 charges and you can get them all in a row or you can place 20 pieces and won't gain a single charge.4°) Picking the piece that you want from the pond can be really hard. Due to a glitch (or bad programming), if yhere are 2 consecutive pieces overlapped, it will ALWAYS give you the first piece (the left one) regardless of which is on top. This can actually help you to solve the puzzles (it is explained in guides how to do it), but it aomewhat kills the fun of doing a puzzle.It has some good parts too:1°) It has a decent variety of piece shapes, but sometimes this can be annoying.2°) The pieces are always oriented the right way (you can't rotate the pieces). It the beginning it may seem boring, but later on you will be grateful that you don't need to rotate the pieces.3°) You won't lose any of the pieces like you would with a classic jigsaw puzzle if you are not careful.4°) Achievements are not hard. 24 of the you will get just by finishing all puzzles. You also have to catch the fish which is moving around in the water (you will probably do this by mistake) and you must the fish in the Shishi-odoshi (I think that's what it's called that water thingy at the bottom left corner).Overall it's not a very bad game, but it's not worth 7 €/$. If you can get it in a bundle or on a sale (at least 66%) then you should give it a try (if you like jigsaw puzzles of course).			"

												While the game is extremely fun to play, it is really bad.Developers made almost no effort to deliver a good product, there are 2 hugely bad things about this game: the piece ""fishing"" system and the audio (both music and effects)As you can see from preview images, puzzle pieces float on a pond and you have to pick them up while they move/shuffle. In theory this should be good, but with a lot of pieces floating around (level 3+ puzzles) even if you click on the piece you want to pick up, you're offered other pieces instead, countless times. For me this is bad coding, plain and simple, because any tester can notice that and for sure the system is not supposed to work like that.Then there's the audio. Effects and music seems to have been recorded with a cell phone or something similar, I usually play with headphones and the background noise was terribly annoying.Many reviewers pointed out also that this game lacks a mid-puzzle save feature, but I have to say that it took at most one hour to complete puzzles (played 10h to complete 15 puzzles) and even if you're really bad with puzzles I can't see how you could spend more than idk, 2 hours trying to solve any of them, therefore I don't think the save feature is really something that is badly missing.So, again, I fully enjoyed playing this puzzle game, but because of the above I'd probably not recommend it to anyone, just buy a real physical puzzle instead.

												First of all, know that I'm not exactly a fan of jigsaw puzzles. I don't mind playing them sometimes, but I wouldn't consider myself being fond of them. If you are a big fan of those, maybe the points I'll make won't be negative for you. If that's the case, feel free to disregard my opinion.The main gimmick to this game is that the pieces move around. It wouldn't be so bad, but the way they made it, is incredibly frustrating. The pond where the pieces float is rather small. In the beginning it's not a problem, since the pieces are big, and there is not a lot of them. Later on though, pieces get smaller, and there's a whole lot more of them, but the pond stays the same size, which results in hundreds of puzzle pieces being on top of one another, in giant pile that you can't do anything about. And what's even worse, even if you somehow happen to see in that pile the exact piece you need at the moment, you won't be able to pick it up, unless there is no other piece next to it. That is because the controls are somehow broken, and the game will pick up any piece BUT the one that you are pointing at.Another big flaw is the lack of saving your progress. Later puzzles, combined with those broken and frustrating controls, can take several hours to complete, and you have to do that in one sitting or you'll be forced to start over.If you prefer it that way, great. But not everyone has the time and patience to do so, and such not even having the option to save is just bad design.Other than that, it's just a regular jigsaw puzzle with regular photographs of Japanese scenery, which is why I also feel like I've been lied to a little bit. With a title being ""Pixel Puzzles"" I expected, what else, pixel art, and I've got none of that.			"

												The concept of having pieces to a puzzle floating in a koi pond is cute at first, but quickly becomes the antithesis of ""zen"" mentality from playing this game that the makers seem to be going for. Once the puzzles have more pieces and the floaters clump together, it becomes more of a game of ""let's see if I can get the piece I need THIS time"" as one repeatedly, with frustration and mostly without success, clicks wrong piece after wrong piece after wrong piece... then the RIGHT PIECE!... only to misclick and lose it again.

												There are jigsaws and you complete them. Several other reviews have already pointed out how unrealistic the shapes of pieces can be but it's a videogame adaptation of an otherwise old and quite dull hobby - surely you can forgive a few unlikely shaped pieces? The soundtrack is nice enough and my only real gripe is that the volume settings reset when the game is closed and reopened as are puzzles so you can't save progress. Play when awake, if you're tired it'll be mighty infuriating (I know).Is it worth the £4.99 ($6.99) price tag? I'd say no. I picked it up on sale for 49p ($0.72) and for that it's worthwhile.			"

												[I'm only about 1/2 through so far, playing on a casual basis from time to time]A not-so-quickly completed puzzle game based on the classic board game puzzle pieces; featuring a variety of shapes and sizes with increasing difficulty.# Relaxing Music, although the occasional sound of the Sōzu can get irritating after a while!# Increasing difficulty and changing shapes really adds to the difficulty and the desire to continue playing# Well chosen imagery depicting various aspects of Japan in a more traditional sense# ...Here fishy fishy!Aside from the minor annoyance with the Sōzu already mentioned above I would say the only improvements I could offer would be for MORE puzzles. If there is more of them later - then great! Otherwise a random mode would be great to see for replayability. Randomise the amount of pieces based on a chosen difficulty, then pick different imagery and shape/size of pieces.The only downside is its price. $7 can get you a lot more than just puzzles; it can get you an RPG or a cheap shooter.I got the game free as part of an offer, but can definitely recommend during bundled sales.

												Don't be fooled by its appearance - this is an incredibly advanced game. Not only is it the only jigsaw puzzle on Steam, but it is the first which can read your mind. How else could it possibly know which piece you are trying to pick up and give you something different every single time on the difficult puzzles? I mean, it's not like the devs could design a game so badly as to have completely broken hit detection for selecting a piece, particularly having decided to have them all in constant motion, and then never got around to patching it...right?

												This game is a pretty straightforward collection of 21 jigsaw puzzles, with each puzzle depicting a different Japanese landmark.19 of the puzzles are structured into unlockable tiers: Tier 1 ""Initiate"" = six 60-piece puzzles, Tier 2 ""Disciple"" = five 112-piece puzzles, Tier 3 ""Student"" = four 153-piece puzzles, Tier 4 ""Scholar"" = three 220-piece puzzles, and Tier 5 ""The All Knowing One"" = one 350-piece puzzle.You start off the game with access to only the easiest group of puzzles, and must complete every challenge in that bracket to unlock the next set of difficulty. In addition to these tiered sets, there are also two separate bonus puzzles, available at any time from the golden section of the selection screen. They are in line with the higher difficulty settings, one because of its high piece count, and the other because of its unusual piece shapes. That's one thing I really like about this game, it plays with the overall shape of the pieces and with the interlocking edges. While there are a few puzzles that utilize the traditional silhouette, most of them mix it up with non-uniform sizing and unique key designs (spirals, arrows, prongs, pinking sheared, jagged scallops, etc).As far as the puzzle gameplay is concerned, the format is simple. You start out with a blank ""sand garden"" space where you build your puzzle, surrounded by an L-shaped koi pond that houses your unused pieces. You then use your mouse to pick up pieces from the pond and move them around the game board. When a piece is dropped close enough to the correct placement, a sound effect with play and it will snap into place. Overall, the game is as basic as it gets. You can change the colour of the sand, you can adjust the volume of the music, and you can switch between fullscreen and windowed, but beyond that there isn't any additional functionality:- You can't save your progress mid-puzzle. If you exit a puzzle screen, either to the main menu or to the desktop, you forfeit any work you have done so far (completed puzzles stay completed, however). - You can't turn off the water feature. The unused pieces in the koi pond are constantly floating, moving, and overlapping each other, and the pieces that appear on top of the pile are not always the ones that will be picked up by your mouse. This is not really a problem when you are dealing with 60 pieces, but on the harder difficulties you will spend half of your time trying to fruitlessly and frustratingly fish out the pieces you want from the pond.- There is no zoom mode. The board size remains the same regardless of piece count, so on the higher difficulty tiers it gets harder and harder to see the edges of the pieces.- You are unable to consult even a thumbnail of the image you are working on during a puzzle.- You can't build sections of the puzzle independently and then move those sections into place. - The 21 puzzles are always the same on every playthrough. While you are puzzling, you are entertained by occasional snippets of music. There are a handful of motifs programmed into the game, each one no more than 10-30 seconds long, and each one sounding like the introduction to a song rather than a complete melody. Sometimes you will hear a refrain and then 1-2 minutes of silence. Sometimes the game will play a medley of snippets back-to-back. Sometimes the game will play the same snippet back-to-back. It's possible that the music is somehow tied-in to what actions you are doing, but I couldn't discern any predictable pattern or rationale. Honestly, the snippets themselves were enjoyable, atmospheric, and in-line with the cultural aesthetic of the game, but their length, and the inconsistency of how they were played, was distracting and annoying. (What the music thought it sounded like: ""Nostalgic touches of music, liltingly carried on the wind, falling on your ears like leaves falling from trees..."" What the music actually sounded like: ""A child haltingly and repetitively trying to learn shamisen in the apartment next door."")There are 26 achievements for the game, which basically boil down to ""play all the puzzles and mess with the fish."" You will automatically unlock 99% of them in one playthrough.TL;DR - If you are just looking for a casual and basic jigsaw game with a good number of puzzles, creative piece designs, and featuring postcard-quality images from Japan, then this is 100% the game for you. However, if you are looking for a high-challenge, high-frill game with adaptive puzzles, sectional construction, zoomable game boards, a rocking soundtrack, and advanced save features, then this is simply not going to meet your expectations. For what it is, and what it claims to be, it does a pretty decent job. I received this game for free as part of a bundle, and got 11 hours of mostly-fun gameplay out of it. I would give it a 7/10.

The music can be pretty repetitive and instead of relaxing it can actually make you pretty sick of it after some time playing the game (You can turn it off, of course, so it's not that great of a problem). It is also pretty hard to see the pieces when they're flowing along the river (where all the to-play pieces are at), since it is smaller and they get one over the other.Also, when you pick a piece, it usually picks not the piece that you're aiming at, but instead another random piece (after some thoughts, I think it actually picks the piece that goes closer at the top of the puzzle, although it actually changed with some puzzles).But if you like jigsaw puzzles it can be fun for a while. Also, you can leave the game open and return to it from time to time, like a real jigsaw.			"

												It is what it is, you do a Jigsaw.Puzzle pieces move around the screen in attempt to raise difficulty. As you progress puzzles have more pieces.Each puzzle takes a reasonable amount of time to complete, took me a lazy Sunday afternoon to complete.Game wasn't expensive and was enjoyable enough to myself as I enjoy jigsaws. If you don't its probably not for you, not many other mechanics too it.			"

												Pretty fun puzzle simulator with neat pieces cut into odd shapes. Didn't like how the pieces kept moving endlessly, couldn't save and quit my progress, and locking the reference picture to a temp bonus for getting so many pieces all brought down what was a pleasant experience otherwise.

												This is a decent puzzle game. I found it to be a bit challenging since you have no option of looking at the box to figure out what the puzzle might look like, until you build up the power meter and then you are only given a brief glance of the puzzle for 5 or so seconds.Some of the things it lacks are the fact there is no save feature. (so you can go back to your puzzle if you are getting tired, or just run out of time) You have to play through the puzzle all the way or lose your progress.Picking up pieces can be troublesome as well. It will tend to not let you pick up that edge piece unless it is the only piece with an inch of space around it, and even then, it may select another piece instead.I did finish all the puzzles in this game and even though it did not unlock the last two puzzles I had done; I was ok with that. A good time waster, but not really much replay value.			"

The music adds a nice touch of Japan and while the puzzles can get tricky you can always go back to the easy ones.

												""Pixel Puzzles: Japan"" is a fine timewaster.Do you like puzzles? Excellent. Do you like Japanese culture? It's certainly not necessary but if you like it it's even better.There are 21 puzzles in total to finish with photorealistic motifs mostly of Japanese buildings and gardens. First, of course, the puzzles are very easy. But don't underestimate the last ones. They can really steal the time as their puzzle pieces become smaller, more and more special in shape, the motifs also seem to be unclearer to see. But all in all they're good to solve.So the gameplay is just dragging pieces to certain places until they automatically snap in. But it can be a pain in the a... to grab a very certain piece you want because they all float into each other (like on water) and it also turns into a ""catch me if you can"" game. Just to prepare you for possible little moments of frustration.The graphics are not especially beautiful but okay. When it comes to music there's only one Japanese instrumental song played. It's nice but soon you won't wanna listen to the same song over and over again. So either mute the music or do so and hold your own (Japanese) background music on standby.I recommend this game for relaxing puzzle sessions (I, for example, enjoyed this a lot after work) and would like to try out the other puzzle games by Decaying Logic someday.

												Do yourself a favor and do not play this game.Not only is it very slow paced in higher levels, the ""calming"" music and moving puzzlepieces will make anyone mad.But if you are like me, you want to finish all levels and get 100% achievements, so for that a tip:Start with the outer layer and put similair coloured or similair marked puzzle pieces on the field.I especially hated the cherry blossom puzzle, because all pieces look very alike.For that puzzle you probably want to look at the twigs between the leaves, if you know the direction, you can place about half of the pieces.luckily I didn't pay for this game, it's really not worth spending money on.the hint system is very annoying, if they improved that, maybe it'd be more fun to play.

												Recently I was extremely bored and looking for games in my massive steam library to get 100% achievements on. I ran across Pixel Puzzles: Japan which I picked up from some bundle offer at one point and installed it. My girlfriend came home from work and I asked her to play a video game with me, which is at times very hard to get her to do. She agreed and I decided to fire up this game, as she is quite the puzzle-holic and loves jigsaw puzzles. After hours of playtime, we got all of the achievements in the game and had a good time doing it. Pixel Puzzles: Japan is basically a set of normal jigsaw puzzles on PC. There are 19 different puzzles in the game, which get incrementally larger the farther you go. Putting together the puzzles is fairly simple and works well overall. One large annoyance we experienced consistently is attempting to grab a piece from the ""pond"", where the pieces you have yet to put down float around until you grab them. Whenever you try to grab a piece floating with others, the majority of the time the game will not grab the correct piece, causing frustration. This can be remedied by just pulling out a bunch of pieces and throwing them on your board, until you can grab the right one. As you place pieces in the correct spot, they lock onto the board to aid in speeding things up as well. The puzzles are all based on Japanese locations and themes, hence the name of the game.Pixel Puzzles: Japan was a nice game to play over a few evenings to 100% achievements, and I recommend it if you can find it at a budget price.

												Let's set things straight: the game itself is a fine, simple, jigsaw puzzle game with a terrible, horribly frustrating addition. I'm unsure wether this is a regional tradition, or just a cruel joke on people who just want to get things done such as myself, but apparently the damn puzzle pieces flow in a river stream. A. River. Stream.So, whenever you set your eyes on the damn piece you've been looking for since the beginning of the puzzle, it WILL end up being either submerged, or dragged in a larger clump of pieces. Is this bad for everyone? Not sure. Is it making me wish i could drown myself in the rriver for the sake of never ever being forced to fish up pieces ever again? You bet.""C'mon man, it can't be all this bad"" you might say... Of course you never tried to get ahold of THAT single ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of puzzle for 2 minutes straight, as your mouse pointer hovers over it giggling at your feeble attempts. Because, of course, even if you're pointing the piece you want as if you were an italian pointer dog, it WILL fail. Repeatedly.If the whole point of the game is supposed to be relaxation and patience, may I say it fails kind of hard in both regards. Even the music, which is kind of interesting to listen to at first gets kind of unnerving after a few rounds of ""catch the ducking piece"" enchancing the whole ""i hope this damn stream explodes and just leaves the damn pieces lying around the board"" sensation.Ah, and ""dulcis in fundu"", you don't even get a damn clue on what the final image will look like ingame, so have fun trying to figure out where each piece belongs based purely on INSTINCT and, idk, supernatural powers of farseeing.I won't say anything about the puzzle selection menu, which is a game per se, in which the sole objective is to START THE GAME because I can't muster enough strength to bash it as well.I got this game for free, as a gift, and at first i did believe it was a gesture of friendship. Now i know i've got a mortal enemy out there, keeping an eye out for me, taking adavantage of my weak points.			"

												After about 7 hours and a half in this game I think I can write a proper review for it. It has both bad and good things but it's not unplayable, despite it's flaws.At first it was really fun, but as you play more and more you start to observe the problems with this game. And they are annoying: 1°) Lack of a save feature (last puzzle has 350 pieces and it took me about an hour to complete). If you are not patient enough, this game is not for you. You could Alt+Tab the game and do something else as a break from the puzzle, but I wouldn't do that to much (in the past I had some problems with some games on steam where I couldn't Alt+Tab because that would break the game).2°) The music is kind of nice, but it becames repetitive quite fast. You could try to mute it, but that would mute all sounds of the game and there is a little click sound when you place a piece in the right place which I found quite useful.3°) The images are nice, but have too many similar colors and aren't in HiRes. As the puzzles had more and more pieces it became quite hard to find the exact place where one piece would fit. It's even harder if you have a small screen (I played mine on a laptop and it was very painful and it placed a lot of strain on my eyes). The fact that it doesn't show you a big picture of what the puzzle should look like it doesn't help at all. It does have a little ""hint"" thing where it shows you the picture for a few seconds, but it puts the pieces over the actual picture and when you have many correct pieces it became even harder to find where you should put the other pieces (you can move the pieces normal when this ""hint"" it's activated). The ""hint"" button is charged at random when you place pieces correctly; you need 8 charges and you can get them all in a row or you can place 20 pieces and won't gain a single charge.4°) Picking the piece that you want from the pond can be really hard. Due to a glitch (or bad programming), if yhere are 2 consecutive pieces overlapped, it will ALWAYS give you the first piece (the left one) regardless of which is on top. This can actually help you to solve the puzzles (it is explained in guides how to do it), but it aomewhat kills the fun of doing a puzzle.It has some good parts too:1°) It has a decent variety of piece shapes, but sometimes this can be annoying.2°) The pieces are always oriented the right way (you can't rotate the pieces). It the beginning it may seem boring, but later on you will be grateful that you don't need to rotate the pieces.3°) You won't lose any of the pieces like you would with a classic jigsaw puzzle if you are not careful.4°) Achievements are not hard. 24 of the you will get just by finishing all puzzles. You also have to catch the fish which is moving around in the water (you will probably do this by mistake) and you must the fish in the Shishi-odoshi (I think that's what it's called that water thingy at the bottom left corner).Overall it's not a very bad game, but it's not worth 7 €/$. If you can get it in a bundle or on a sale (at least 66%) then you should give it a try (if you like jigsaw puzzles of course).			"

												The puzzles are great.  The idea of having the pieces floating in the river is great.  The IDEA of plucking the pieces out of the river like fish is great.  Actually trying to grab a piece out of the river is ridiculous.  You can click (literally) dozens of times on the piece you want and pick up instead some other piece every time.  In fact, the piece you actually get is usually no where near the piece you're clicking on.  Its a mess on higher level puzzles with more pieces.  It's maddening.  I can only imagine what a nightmare the last puzzle is going to be but I want to finish them all so ... :(			"

												A perfect little game to play while waiting for a download to finish or something like that. A nice theme, some pretty challenging puzzles later on, but there are just too many small annoyances that make you think: 'why didn't the developers fix this? They surely must have played their own game?'These are the things that make a possibly calming game into an occasional teeth grinder:Puzzles can't be saved mid-game. So when you have been playing Pixel Puzzles while waiting for something to finish downloading you can't save your current state of the puzzle. This destroys the whole casual nature of the game. It's either finish the puzzle or start the puzzle over the next time. And with pretty masive puzzles in later levels, that's just not cool.The puzzle pieces literally float around a fish pond that surround half the puzzle field. In later levels the amount of pieces increases. This also makes the puzzles pieces very, very small. It becomes quite hard to see them and properly discern them from one another. And to add to the problems with this...The mouse pointer is incredibly inaccurate. Imagine wanting to click-drag a puzzle piece from the pond onto the table, and having to click six or seven times, because the pointer keeps picking up pieces besides the one you want. Oh, and remember that the pieces float around? Yeah, terribly annoying.The sound is supposed to add to the meditative, monastery-like atmosphere of the game. Too bad the sound quality is pretty low and several sound effects have a slight static to them when they play.For €6,99 there's just too many obvious things unnecessarily working against the player. Around €2 would be acceptable and I then would also recommend the game, because the puzzles are challenging and have a pretty big 'just one more puzzle before bed' feel about them.			"

Introduction: Pixel Puzzles: Japan is a casual game in which you solve a variety of jigsaw puzzles by clicking and dragging a puzzle piece from the river surrounding the board to where it belongs on the board itself. While the game does several things correctly, it ultimately has too many problems for me to truly recommend it. It is a decent game, but falls just short of greatness.Gameplay:  Being a jigsaw puzzle game, there is only a certain amount of gameplay to be expected. You solve the jigsaw puzzles by clicking on a puzzle piece from a flowing river around the edge of the board to the board itself. It's simple; however there are a few annoyances. The river constantly moves the puzzle pieces around, which is quite neat for the smaller puzzles. However, the puzzle pieces bounce off each other and the edges of the river. This results in puzzle pieces being clumped together on the larger puzzles, even getting stuck in corners. In one such puzzle, there were about seven puzzle pieces stuck in a corner, overlapping each other. Picking the puzzle piece you want in this mess is an annoyance as the click detection seems a bit off. Despite my mouse being directly over the desired puzzle piece, I would often pick up the puzzle piece just beside it, over and over. Even though I knew the piece I wanted, I struggled against the game to actually get it. Dropping a puzzle piece back in the river spawns it to the bottom left part of the river instead of the spot you dropped it, which further adds to the ""clumping"" issue.For the small puzzles, the river is actually quite a refreshing concept. For the larger puzzles, it quickly turns into an annoyance, making it take much longer than it should to solve the puzzle.Upon correctly putting a puzzle piece in the correct spot on the board, you will randomly get a piece of the yin and yang symbol. Upon fully completing the symbol, you will be able to temporarily see the completed puzzle on the board and the pieces you have already placed. This is an interesting concept, but it ultimately felt...a bit pointless. In most cases, I felt like this made it even more difficult to see what I had placed and what was left. I only found the feature useful on the last puzzle. It is also random when you get a piece of the symbol; however it happened often enough to not be an issue. It may help solve the puzzle, but I feel it could have been done better.There are 21 puzzles in the game to complete, which is very reasonable for the price tag. Not all of the puzzles are available to complete right way, however. The player must complete the smaller puzzles to unlock the larger ones. This gives a sense of progression, which is interesting for this genre of game. There is actually an, albeit brief, cut-scene that plays showing the player's avatar ""levelling up"". Completing every puzzle in the game took approximately 9 hours. The puzzle sizes range from 60 pieces to 350 pieces.Art & Graphics:  The game captures a Japanese feel to it quite well. All of the puzzles carry a Japanese theme, and the board the player assembles the puzzle on also has this same theme. The graphics are simple - about what you would expect for a puzzle game. I had no difficulty running the game on a 1920x1080 monitor while also using dual monitors.Sound:  Unfortunately, the game only has one music track that plays both on the main menu of the game, and when assembling puzzles. This music track carries a Japanese theme and is relaxing for a time; however I had to disable the music after completing a few puzzles as it got tiring. Besides the music, there is not much other sound to speak of. There is no sound that plays when inserting a puzzle piece to the correct place unless it randomly gives you a piece of the yin and yang symbol. There is no sound when the player ""levels up"" their avatar. There is no sound when completing the puzzle. The game feels very quiet. As a result, I hope you love the one music track that plays, or you had best play your own music in the background.Replay Value:  Once you complete every puzzle, there is no incentive to do so again. Every puzzle has the exact same pieces every time and your avatar only levels up to a certain point. While the developers have added two free puzzles to the game in the past (the game originally had 19), it is very unlikely more puzzles will be added. There are 26 achievements for the game, although nearly all of them are only for completing the puzzles.Prismatic Complaints:  There is no save feature for the game. If you exit out of the puzzle, your computer crashes, or your power goes out: you are out of luck. Completing a puzzle saves your progress of course, however your progress on the puzzle itself is not saved. This makes it a difficult game to play casually, as you either have to complete a puzzle in one sitting or leave the game running to finish it later. There is also no Steam cloud support.Closing: While Pixel Puzzles: Japan does several things right and tries new things, it ultimately falls a bit short of greatness. The game is fun, and I enjoyed my time on it, however the annoyances are a bit too frequent. The lack of many sounds, as well as the lack of saving, also brings the game down a bit. If you're a fan of jigsaw puzzles, you will likely have a good time, but be frustrated by the annoyances the game has.  "

												This is an awesome puzzle game like the real Puzzle that you can buy and assemble, the only difference between them is you don't have to worry that you misught misplace some of the puzzle pieces because its all in here intact digitally, and cannot be use during power outtage or brownouts. I really have fun playing this game 9/10			"

												I love doing jigsaw puzzles but I never thought to see if there were any digital versions on Steam. I found this during a Humble Bundle sale and thought I might as well try it for less than $2. It certainly hasn't made me want to throw out all my real jigsaw puzzles, but for what I paid for it, it's a fun distraction.Pros:-I like the music and sound of the game. It's very minimalist and zen, very traditionally Japanese. It's nicely relaxing for a game like this.-The images are all Japan related, so if you like that kind of thing, you'll like these.-The ""level up"" aspect is sort of neat, levelling up your little monk to do harder and harder puzzles.Cons:-The puzzle pieces floating around in the koi pond is kind of annoying. It makes it hard to see what you have left or to spot corner and edge pieces without. Plus picking up a piece and dropping it drops it in a specified location where that piece 'spawns', not where you dropped it.-Pieces can't be put together on their own, they have to be dropped into their space on the board. So you can't put together a section separately and then move it into the main board when you can. This also means that just moving a piece onto the board to help find its space can sometimes accidentally have you drop it right onto its spot without meaning to where it snaps in, which spoils it a little bit.-The pieces are all always right side up. You don't have to rotate them or anything like that.-The pieces aren't 'standard' puzzle shapes, they're all strange little curves and blobs.The game's certainly not bad, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. And if you're a jigsaw puzzle 'snob' like I sort of am then the experience is pretty different. But for a cheap price and an hour or so of relaxing with a warm drink, this is perfectly fine.			"

												It's all fun and games at the beginning and you wonder how is it even possible to screw up on a simple game like this. The puzzles are easy, not too many pieces, but then you get to the last ones and the flaws become apparent. You can't save your progress in the middle of a puzzle, you can't join pieces together out of the board, and, the worst of all, you can't get the piece you want because it's burrowed under thousands of others you don't want, and because every piece just decides to float wherever they want, there is no way to dig them out in time.Also, if you manage to stack every single piece, you always get them in the correct order from the top left to bottom right, so nice programming.

												I love puzzles like this but with the higher piece ones you'll spend more time trying to grab the piece you want then almost anything else. You'll try to grab one piece and you actually grab one thats isn't close to your mouse pointer. On top of that when you place that one back in the water all that are near the place you put it go back to the ""starting spot"" and you have to wait for them to spead out again. On top of all that why isn't there a simple save button.			"

												I really do like this game, but it has some major bugs. Out of the 14 puzzles I have completed, I've had to restart three when I only had one piece left to place. I had to restart twice due to the final piece not fitting correctly. One needed to be rotated and the second time the piece shape needed to be flipped (the negative size needed to be on the right and the positive side needed to be on the left). The third time, there wasn't a final piece, the game somehow made one piece just disappear. I grabbed the fish a million times to try and see it if was stuck, searched the river and corners, I clicked all over the completed puzzle to make sure it wasn't just hidden on the board, but alas, it was nowhere. I also find it to be frustrating when trying to grab a specific piece and it grabs every single piece other than the one I have selected. I usually get around this by only selecting pieces that are on the top since they are not as crowded. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is a completionist, like me, due to the fact that sometimes you cant complete the puzzle unless you restart. I still purchased this despite a review saying they didn't recommend this, but it was less than a dollar. However, once I experienced these bugs, I found myself wondering how in the world something could be so badly designed that pieces dont fit/ are missing. Either way, I think this is a great idea and it is relaxing (until you experience said bugs). I just wish they would fix the bugs and then it will be a great, simple, and cheap game.			"

												Althought I like puzzles and puzzle games, I cannot recommend this game based on two glaring issues.-No save feature: this is the big one. Not being able to save means you're stuck working on a puzzle or leaving it running in the background unless you want to start completely over.-Piece selection: 9 times out of 10, clicking on piece you need will make you pick up a different piece that is floating around near it. It's frustrating to say the least, and the later puzzles (200+ pieces) are almost impossible to finish without the stacking exploit because of this failure to point and click.If you're an achievement hunter, the 26 achievements aren't hard to earn, just very, very tedious. The game also drops 6 cards, but the are almost worthless on the market due to the free keys for this game given away recently.If a save feature was implemented and the piece selection fixed, I would recommend this game; until that time, save your money and your hours for something else. I haven't played anything else in the series so I do not know how they compare.			"

												A surprisingly nice way to pass the time and take a break from all your action, MMO, FPS, RPG, rogue-like, dungeon-crawler what-have-yous. The atmosphere, music, and puzzles are quite immersive and the go-at-your-own-pace (non-timed) element makes this great for young and old alike.That said, there are some obvious flaws within Pixel Puzzles - Japan:There is no mid-level save feature. This is the biggest issue that can easily flip a recommendation. The beginning levels are easy enough to sit through in one sitting, taking anywhere between 5-20 minutes each (or more if you're really taking your time). Once the puzzles get harder (and the amount of pieces start increasing), the probability of you wanting to take a break will shoot up. Your only options for taking a breather will be either to 1. Tab out of the game and leave it running until you want to come back to it or 2. Close out of the game and restart the entire level. Both options are pains in their own ways.Puzzle-fishing can sometimes be more annoying than the puzzle itself. Puzzle pieces float around in a pond that borders your puzzle mat (it's actually a zen garden -- fitting). There is no pause feature for the pond so you're left trying to grab the piece you want in the middle of all the others. Clicking or click-hold-releasing a piece over the pond will make it poof and teleport somewhere else in the water. When you've been clearing out a pile and you accidentally clear out the piece you want as well.. it's a little frustrating. It's easily avoidable if you're not a dolt like me.Possible catch-release bug? Not quite sure if it's my laptop/touchpad/mouse but it sometimes takes me a couple of clicks to pick up pieces. Some of them get ""stuck"" on the board (when they're not in the right place) and takes several tries to grab. I'm running Windows 8.1 in case the problem's on my end.Cons taken into consideration, I would still recommend this game if gifted or purchased on a discount. I don't think the retail price is worth dealing with the snags that may make you want to rage-quit (or completely abandon the game) but it's a good little single-player casual to fiddle around with.

												Don't be fooled by its appearance - this is an incredibly advanced game. Not only is it the only jigsaw puzzle on Steam, but it is the first which can read your mind. How else could it possibly know which piece you are trying to pick up and give you something different every single time on the difficult puzzles? I mean, it's not like the devs could design a game so badly as to have completely broken hit detection for selecting a piece, particularly having decided to have them all in constant motion, and then never got around to patching it...right?

												There aren't too many different ways to describe this game. It's a very fun, relaxing game about solving puzzles! If you're not that into puzzle solving the game may become dull quickly, but it's fantastic for relaxed play with great music and beautiful images to create by completing the puzzle.			"

												So... What to say about 'Pixel Puzzles: Japan'... It's a puzzle game! No rotating blocks... No floating pills... No exploading candies, gems or animals... But an actual jigsaw puzzle game. Now if it were just that, my review would be done now, but there's more. The puzzles are lovely and are in various shapes, cuts and sizes.The goal of the game is simple... Complete a puzzle and obtain a golden puzzle piece for your monk so that he may ascend to a higher state... and ultimately, puzzles with more pieces. As you set about the task putting together the puzzles, the pieces not on the board yet, float around on the surface of a pond and you have to try and scoop up the piece you'd like. If you toss a piece back into the water, you can sink a number of pieces foor a moment in hopes of making it easier to grab the piece you do want... And that's it.It's a nice, simple and relaxing game, set to soothing oriental music; perfect for the casual gamer that enjoys a slow paced game or the hardcore garmer looking to find that calm before the storm of bullets and rampaging zombies... among other things.

												After completing all the puzzles and therefore earning all the achievements, I feel competent enough to tell you about this game.But man, it sure is hard to review it. Why is it hard, you ask? Well, if you came here to get a game that allows you to piece together jigsaw puzzles, it's exactly what it is. But still, even a simple game like this can have numerous issues that will ruin your experience with it. And this one is no exception.The first thing and the most obvious thing is the fact that you can't piece together one small part of the puzzle and keep it somewhere to the side so you can use it later, after you make some progress on the ""big picture"". Every piece has its designated place on the board, and you can only put them there one at a time, after which you can't move them anymore.The second thing is the fact that those puzzle pieces float around in the water that surrounds the board. Why is that a problem? Well, on the first few 60-piece puzzles, it isn't. You can get most of the pieces easily or with just a bit of stressful effort. But when you get to those bigger puzzles, then you'll notice this game's main flaw - the inability to properly grab a piece. Whatever could that mean? It means that the game grabs EVERY. SINGLE. PUZZLE. PIECE. AROUND. THE. ONE. THAT. YOU. WANTED. BUT. NOT. THE. ONE. THAT. YOU. WANTED. It is so frustrating that you will be tearing your eyes out after not grabbing your piece for the 20th time. I'm not even kidding, one time I counted how many tries it would take to get the piece that I wanted, and I stopped counting after I had passed twenty.But wait, that's not all. How could it be all? It seems that the developers really wanted to make you feel the water that the pieces float in, so they tried to make this ""splash"" feature where, after you drop an unwanted puzzle piece into the water right above some other floating pieces, those floating pieces that were ""underneath"" the one you dropped will get moved to some other place in the water. And that is really annoying, because you'll always be grabbing onto unwanted pieces, and when you accidentally let go of your mouse click, the piece that you wanted will be lost within the maze of floating pieces that all look alike.And get this - that piece-grab recognition failure occurs in every puzzle but the last one. The last puzzle is pretty smooth and it just makes me wonder why it couldn't be like that before. It's like the developer knew how to make the piece-grabbing responsive, but decided to troll you the whole time until the last puzzle.As far as music goes, I guess it's okay if you're into that whole Japan-style culture, but I still think it could have been much better. An occasional oriental sound or two with long pauses in between doesn't make a relaxing soundtrack, it just manages to surprise you every time because you totally forget there's even a soundtrack in this game.The puzzles mostly feature japanese architecture, so if you like that too, I think you'll be satisfied. I myself would have preferred a puzzle game featuring animals, to be honest, but that's just my misanthropy speaking. (lol)Oh, and each puzzle has its pieces cut into different shapes, so that's pretty cool! It helps keep each puzzle fresh, in my opinion.But ultimately, I'm supposed to tell you if you should give your money for this game, and I believe you shouldn't. Seven euros is simply too much for a game with this many flaws. I'm glad I got it for free on indiegala, so if you didn't get it there while it was still available and you simply feel the need to get it, at least buy it on a sale or in a bundle. Those seven euros can be spent on better things, whether here on Steam, or in the offline world.			"

												Before Pixel Puzzles: Japan, I was nothing. I loved a girl, but she didn't like me. I wasn't cool enough for her. But then I got this game. I asked her to come to my house:-Hey! Wanna come over my house?-Why?-Ummm to watch a movie or play videogames, I guess.-No ♥♥♥♥ing way. I'm not gonna do it.-But I got Pixel Puzzles: Japan!-What time do you want me to come over your place?-Idk, around 7pm? Is that fine?-Yeah, sure!I showed her the game and she told me to have sex with her. I said ""hell yeah"". Thought it was the best day of my life. But a few days later, she brought a friend of hers as well. We were officially in a relationship and it was awesome! Thanks to Pixel Puzzles: Japan, not only did I have a gorgeous girlfriend and awesome sex every day, but we occasionally had threesomes as well.Time had passed, it had been 1-2 months, and I kept playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan. I had become addicted to Pixel Puzzles: Japan. All I was thinking was Pixel Puzzles. All I was dreaming was Pixel Puzzles. All I could see, hear, feel, smell, taste, was Pixel Puzzles. My girlfriend started to hate that game, because I prefered Pixel Puzzles over her companion. But I was fine. She wasn't. So, we broke up. Two days later, I lost my job. I got kicked out of my house because I had no money to pay the rent 1 month later. I'm currently living in a basement in London where I get WiFi from a neighbour. I haven't slept for 1 whole week. I cannot do anything. Pixel Puzzles: Japan became the love of my life. This game made me realise the meaning of life. Or, to be exact, this game is the meaning of life. I am now raising money to visit the Great Pixel Puzzle Monk in Japan. It's a dream coming true. Your help will be appreciated. Help me make the world a better place. Believe in Pixel Puzzles: Japan. Amen.			"

												I love puzzles like this but with the higher piece ones you'll spend more time trying to grab the piece you want then almost anything else. You'll try to grab one piece and you actually grab one thats isn't close to your mouse pointer. On top of that when you place that one back in the water all that are near the place you put it go back to the ""starting spot"" and you have to wait for them to spead out again. On top of all that why isn't there a simple save button.			"

												I really do like this game, but it has some major bugs. Out of the 14 puzzles I have completed, I've had to restart three when I only had one piece left to place. I had to restart twice due to the final piece not fitting correctly. One needed to be rotated and the second time the piece shape needed to be flipped (the negative size needed to be on the right and the positive side needed to be on the left). The third time, there wasn't a final piece, the game somehow made one piece just disappear. I grabbed the fish a million times to try and see it if was stuck, searched the river and corners, I clicked all over the completed puzzle to make sure it wasn't just hidden on the board, but alas, it was nowhere. I also find it to be frustrating when trying to grab a specific piece and it grabs every single piece other than the one I have selected. I usually get around this by only selecting pieces that are on the top since they are not as crowded. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is a completionist, like me, due to the fact that sometimes you cant complete the puzzle unless you restart. I still purchased this despite a review saying they didn't recommend this, but it was less than a dollar. However, once I experienced these bugs, I found myself wondering how in the world something could be so badly designed that pieces dont fit/ are missing. Either way, I think this is a great idea and it is relaxing (until you experience said bugs). I just wish they would fix the bugs and then it will be a great, simple, and cheap game.			"

												The game is fun until you get to the highest levels. Then it becomes extremely annoying.  The puzzle pieces you want become impossible to grab from the pool of the unused ones - I had to click like ten times until I got the one I wanted (I think this is a bug - they sort of float around, moving constantly, passing over each other, but even though the one I wanted was on the top, clicking on the pile kept giving me the bottom ones that I didn't want... and by the time I got through the pile, others floated over the one I wanted again. EXTREMELY annoying.)Overall, the game has nice environment, a few jokes incorporated into it, not-so-special pictures as puzzles (I didn't find the photographies used particularly beautiful - they look like snapshots a tourist might take when visiting Japan), and no option to save your unfinished work.  Overall, I'd give it about 45% - it could have been worse, but there are better games to spend money on out there.			"

												This is a pretty good game.  It took 7.8 hours to complete the entire game (19 puzzles) and get all the achievements.  There is nothing wrong with the game technically and it works perfectly.  The pictures that make up the puzzle are great.  There is a lot of variety in puzzle cuts.  The only negatives are the music and grabbing the pieces in the river during larger puzzles.  The music is redundant so I turned it off and listened to the radio instead.  The game has all of the puzzle pieces floating in a river above and to the left of the puzzle area.  When it gets crowded with a lot of pieces in the more difficult, larger puzzles at the end of the game, you very rarely grab the piece you are clicking on.  Gets annoying and adds more time to the puzzle.  Also, when you grab a piece and don't need it and drop it back in the river it doesn't land where you put it and just disappears and gets mixed up with the rest of the pieces again (so you can't set a piece to the side for later).If you like jigsaw puzzles you'll like this game and for the price you can't go wrong.

												I picked up Pixel Puzzles: Japan as it looked fun, but mostly because it looked like a nice game to relax and chill out with.The game itself is alright, the mechanics work adequately, though can be a little annoying when retrieving pieces from the jigsaw pools.The problem I had with the game, however, is that the audio quality used in the game for the sound effects and background sounds and music were very low quality and were peaking heavily, which hurt my ears after a while, and eventually caused me to exit the game.If you want a nice jigsaw game, I'd recommend it, as it works fine for what it is, however, you may wish to lower the volume.Nilesy			"

The scenery when finisihing each puzzle is very beautiful and lovable. Trading cards  are quite something and the achievements are simple (just beat one level to the next), especially the backgrounds. Besides getting this for free, it's an okay game for receiving 6 cards (from drop) out of 12.Did I mention the puzzle pieces move around constantly?Score: 75.74/100.00It's not very bad, it's just okay.

												The hardest part about this game is not finding the right place for each puzzle part but to pick the desired parts up.Lose pieces floating around the puzzle might look good - but it takes forever to find that specific part you want to pick up because there are others floating over it and when you push the other parts away (this is possible) you also push the part you wanted to pick up away.If you do not have enough time to solve the entire puzzle and have some real life duties... bad luck. You cannot save while you're in the middle of your puzzle. Progress lost.If you find two or more pieces which belong together: you cannot stick them together unless you know the right place on the picture.			"

Kind of forces you to change playstyle and just pick up the edges and work from there by color. The pieces are moving so when you got +200 of them, you'll usually not get the piece you want at the first try. I got the game as a gift. However I wouldn't say it is worth €7 as listed today at 8th December 2015. Wait for a sale and pick it up for half or less if you're into puzzle games.			"

												A very pretty, well done puzzle game with a few quirks.quirk one:  you have to litterally ""fish"" your puzzle peices out of the moat around the board.  Yes, you can catch the fish.  No, you cannot catch the lily pads.  Yes, you can put the fish into the water feature in the bottom left corner of the screen.quirk 2:  This one did bother me a bit.  There is no ""save"" feature.  If you do not finish a puzzle, but close it, you will have to start that puzzle all over again.  This was not an issue on the smaller puzzles at the beginning, but the later ones take a while.  I ended up leaving the game up and running errands and then picking it back up when I came home.....This is still a recommended game and it was a very nice change of pace.			"

												The hardest part about this game is not finding the right place for each puzzle part but to pick the desired parts up.Lose pieces floating around the puzzle might look good - but it takes forever to find that specific part you want to pick up because there are others floating over it and when you push the other parts away (this is possible) you also push the part you wanted to pick up away.If you do not have enough time to solve the entire puzzle and have some real life duties... bad luck. You cannot save while you're in the middle of your puzzle. Progress lost.If you find two or more pieces which belong together: you cannot stick them together unless you know the right place on the picture.			"

												Good puzzles and great music but overall a dull take on Jigsaw Puzzles. Pieces are very tiny and it tends to get very cluttered. Buy only if you like Jigsaw Puzzles or just take that cash and buy an actual jigsaw puzzle. It is a very polished game but it wasn't for me clearly as I am not really much of a jigsaw fan.I got this game for free and the only upside for me was the 6 trading cards.			"

												Oh my word the design choices on this one. Sounds fun and mellow enough, just a classic fit the pieces together puzzle like your grandpa did on the table top. Your grandpa could always look at the box to see the picture, but I still can't seem to figure out how I made the picture pop up that one time. Then there are the absolutely tiny puzzle pieces floating in a pond. Floating all over each other, and generally being a nuisance to click, or find the one piece you want. I've had to click 10 times, randomly getting other nearby pieces, before finally getting the one I want. The pictures themselves are pretty, but several just don't have enough definition between areas of the puzzle. It turns them into a random ""does this fit here?"" mess of trial and error. Then I haven't found a way to save in the middle of a puzzle, you know like grandpa leaving it on the kitchen table til he can get around to it again. If you want to tell me how to save, or look up the puzzle, that's awesome, but it's something the game needs to explain in some clear way itself. Even better would be giving me some static place I can sort the damn puzzle pieces, without just tossing all of them on the puzzle board, where some will obviously randomly click into the right place. That's not how I want the game to work.In short, something seemingly meant to be soothing is for me entirely aggravating.2/5			"

												While moderately enjoyable, I think the interface needs a bit of work before it I can recommend it.Once the number of puzzles pieces get large enough it becomes almost impossible to grab the piece you want.There seems to be some preferential ordering when it comes to picking up pieces, it would be less frustrating if the pieces were displayed with regard to this order (i.e. if you're going to force me to pick up a certain piece then I would like to have that one floating on the top).

												The puzzles are fine, but the game is not. There are too many faults with this game for me to recommend it to anyone.You cannot save your progress if you want to close the game. Puzzles always start from the beginning. It is easy to reset a puzzle, because the game does not ask you for confirmation before resetting a puzzle.Puzzle pieces which haven't been kept on the board yet keep moving around needlessly, which is okay for puzzles with big pieces, i.e. not a feature that improves the game, but not one which makes it frustrating either. However, if you try playing a puzzle with tiny pieces, you will repeatedly pick up pieces that you do not want to use, and as soon as you drop a piece back, it disappears under your mouse, and reappears somewhere else on the 'pond' around the puzzle board. I've had sessions where I picked up 10-15 wrong pieces in a row because the correct one was flowing under a ton of wrong pieces, and then I was so in the flow of picking and dropping wrong pieces that I picked up and dropped back the piece I wanted to use, which then immediately disappeared and went to some other part of the pond, getting lost in the flood of pieces moving around, not to be found again anytime soon.You can't fit puzzle pieces together even if you know that they will eventually end up next to each other. The only way to snap two puzzle pieces together is to put both of them in their correct spots on the board. So, the game makes it hard to work on multiple parts of the puzzle at the same time, unless you can figure out exactly where in the board those parts will fit.Overall: Stay away. This is at best a bad and often frustrating implementation of what is supposed to be a relaxing table top activity.			"

												The concept of having pieces to a puzzle floating in a koi pond is cute at first, but quickly becomes the antithesis of ""zen"" mentality from playing this game that the makers seem to be going for. Once the puzzles have more pieces and the floaters clump together, it becomes more of a game of ""let's see if I can get the piece I need THIS time"" as one repeatedly, with frustration and mostly without success, clicks wrong piece after wrong piece after wrong piece... then the RIGHT PIECE!... only to misclick and lose it again.

Grab it on some sale if you like jigsaws, else don't bother - not expensive at full price, but too expensive for what you get.Btw, there's one big problem with this one:There's a small area where all your pieces moves around constantly. When there's a lot of pieces there, you'll rarely be able to get the one you're pointing at, without removing most others first. That gets extremely annoying very fast.			"

												First off, I love jigsaw puzzles, so it always interests me when there's a jigsaw puzzle title so I can see what kind of gimmicks they put into the software. In this one, you have all the pieces floating around randomly in the water and when you put enough specific pieces in place, you can get a brief preview of what the finished image is supposed to be.For most of the puzzles, this is all fine and dandy. However, when you get to the last few puzzles that are over 200 pieces, trying to find that piece that you're looking for floating in that mess is quite annoying. And then, I don't know how, but somehow the computer knows what piece you're going after and gives you every other piece BUT the one you're going after. It'll even give you a piece that's not where you're clicking, only near it.Another thing that I didn't care for in this title is the method that the pieces snap into place. On this one, the pieces snap to the board. I much prefer that the pieces snap to each other since it makes it easier to see if you got any pieces laying around on the board when you're wondering what the hell you did with the last few pieces.One thing I really did like about this was the interesting ways the pieces were cut. It made the puzzles seem more unique and fun.It took me about 13 hours to go through all of this. My overall rating lands just on the not recommended side.			"

												A jigsaw puzzle game consists of essentially two things: picking peices up, and setting them down. Some how this game manages to screw up both.The snap to grid is ridiculously loose, and does not require *any* adjacent peices, making it a common occurrence to set a piece down and have it magically jump into a position you had not yet identified. Brute forcing tricky areas by picking-up-dropping-picking-up-dropping until it snaps is way to easy to do... trains you quickly to play by trial-and-error not analysis.If that was all, I'd still give this game a thumbs up. Sadly, the peice-selection interface is broken beyond hope. You spot a peice, you mouse directly over it, you click, and... you get randomly one of the thirty closest peices. On the latter puzzles it is virtually impossible to pick up a specific peice without 10-20 attempts. I can't express how frustrating this is. Completely game breaking. Clearly this was not play tested.tl;dr game with real potential sadly broken by unusable interface.			"

												Before Pixel Puzzles: Japan, I was nothing. I loved a girl, but she didn't like me. I wasn't cool enough for her. But then I got this game. I asked her to come to my house:-Hey! Wanna come over my house?-Why?-Ummm to watch a movie or play videogames, I guess.-No ♥♥♥♥ing way. I'm not gonna do it.-But I got Pixel Puzzles: Japan!-What time do you want me to come over your place?-Idk, around 7pm? Is that fine?-Yeah, sure!I showed her the game and she told me to have sex with her. I said ""hell yeah"". Thought it was the best day of my life. But a few days later, she brought a friend of hers as well. We were officially in a relationship and it was awesome! Thanks to Pixel Puzzles: Japan, not only did I have a gorgeous girlfriend and awesome sex every day, but we occasionally had threesomes as well.Time had passed, it had been 1-2 months, and I kept playing Pixel Puzzles: Japan. I had become addicted to Pixel Puzzles: Japan. All I was thinking was Pixel Puzzles. All I was dreaming was Pixel Puzzles. All I could see, hear, feel, smell, taste, was Pixel Puzzles. My girlfriend started to hate that game, because I prefered Pixel Puzzles over her companion. But I was fine. She wasn't. So, we broke up. Two days later, I lost my job. I got kicked out of my house because I had no money to pay the rent 1 month later. I'm currently living in a basement in London where I get WiFi from a neighbour. I haven't slept for 1 whole week. I cannot do anything. Pixel Puzzles: Japan became the love of my life. This game made me realise the meaning of life. Or, to be exact, this game is the meaning of life. I am now raising money to visit the Great Pixel Puzzle Monk in Japan. It's a dream coming true. Your help will be appreciated. Help me make the world a better place. Believe in Pixel Puzzles: Japan. Amen.			"

However, there is no saving, auto or manual. So, expect to sit down and either complete it in one go or have it running in the background while you do other things. If you exit before you completed all the puzzles, you'll have to restart in your Achievement quest.I would recommend this game, although I have been told the other Pixel Puzzles are better. I'd try to catch this one on sale since the nonexistant saving gets REALLY frustrating (especially when you want to take a break and play a different game!)			"

												What I thought would be a relaxing pass-time, is actually the most unintuitive jigsaw puzzle simulator game I've ever played. Almost everything about this game goes against everything I've ever known about putting together puzzles. For instance, y'know when you get two seperate pieces that fit together? I'm not sure about you, but my first instinct would be to fit them together. Unfortunatley, the way the game works, is that each individual piece can only snap into place once it's directly where it needs to be in the picture. So instead of being able to put the puzzle together peice by piece, you're forced to leave all the pieces you need scattered on the board, which brings me to the next biggest problem of the game: The koi pond.Surrounding the top left corners of the board is a koi pond where all of the peices of the puzzle reside. While being an interesting idea in theory, turned out to be this games biggest negative aspect. Again, lets think about how a real-life jigsaw puzzle works. When you're looking around at the countless peices you have to choose from, seeing which colors might match what you're trying to fit in, wouldn't it be great if all of those peices were constantly floating around in a sporadic, aimless fashion making it extremely frustrating to take the peice you want? No. No, that isn't great in the slightest. That isn't even the least of the koi pond issues. More often than not, you'll end up grabbing a piece you didn't mean to pick up, so you'll put it back down in the pond. Where does that peice go, you ask?  It reappears in a random spot in the pond. While this might not seem like that big of an issue, when you're trying to get the peice you need as it meshes in with all the other peices in the pond, if you pick it up and drop it accidentally it flys to a completely different location, further wasting your time. Not to mention there is a koi fish in the pond that you're able to pick up, which will often get in your way of picking up the pieces you want. This game just seems like a whole new species of headache inducing terror, which is a real shame because I really do enjoy the Japanese theme it was introducing, and I really do feel like it could have been great if they reworked those problems. There just needs to be another jigsaw puzzle game like the one from OMGpop.com a few years ago, it was a flawless jigsaw puzzle game that really embodied the experience of putting together a puzzle with your friends. But until then, I guess I'll have to check out Pixel Puzzles: Anime. God help me.			"

												The puzzles are great.  The idea of having the pieces floating in the river is great.  The IDEA of plucking the pieces out of the river like fish is great.  Actually trying to grab a piece out of the river is ridiculous.  You can click (literally) dozens of times on the piece you want and pick up instead some other piece every time.  In fact, the piece you actually get is usually no where near the piece you're clicking on.  Its a mess on higher level puzzles with more pieces.  It's maddening.  I can only imagine what a nightmare the last puzzle is going to be but I want to finish them all so ... :(			"

												I really do like this game, but it has some major bugs. Out of the 14 puzzles I have completed, I've had to restart three when I only had one piece left to place. I had to restart twice due to the final piece not fitting correctly. One needed to be rotated and the second time the piece shape needed to be flipped (the negative size needed to be on the right and the positive side needed to be on the left). The third time, there wasn't a final piece, the game somehow made one piece just disappear. I grabbed the fish a million times to try and see it if was stuck, searched the river and corners, I clicked all over the completed puzzle to make sure it wasn't just hidden on the board, but alas, it was nowhere. I also find it to be frustrating when trying to grab a specific piece and it grabs every single piece other than the one I have selected. I usually get around this by only selecting pieces that are on the top since they are not as crowded. I cannot recommend this to anyone who is a completionist, like me, due to the fact that sometimes you cant complete the puzzle unless you restart. I still purchased this despite a review saying they didn't recommend this, but it was less than a dollar. However, once I experienced these bugs, I found myself wondering how in the world something could be so badly designed that pieces dont fit/ are missing. Either way, I think this is a great idea and it is relaxing (until you experience said bugs). I just wish they would fix the bugs and then it will be a great, simple, and cheap game.			"

												So... What to say about 'Pixel Puzzles: Japan'... It's a puzzle game! No rotating blocks... No floating pills... No exploading candies, gems or animals... But an actual jigsaw puzzle game. Now if it were just that, my review would be done now, but there's more. The puzzles are lovely and are in various shapes, cuts and sizes.The goal of the game is simple... Complete a puzzle and obtain a golden puzzle piece for your monk so that he may ascend to a higher state... and ultimately, puzzles with more pieces. As you set about the task putting together the puzzles, the pieces not on the board yet, float around on the surface of a pond and you have to try and scoop up the piece you'd like. If you toss a piece back into the water, you can sink a number of pieces foor a moment in hopes of making it easier to grab the piece you do want... And that's it.It's a nice, simple and relaxing game, set to soothing oriental music; perfect for the casual gamer that enjoys a slow paced game or the hardcore garmer looking to find that calm before the storm of bullets and rampaging zombies... among other things.

												Althought I like puzzles and puzzle games, I cannot recommend this game based on two glaring issues.-No save feature: this is the big one. Not being able to save means you're stuck working on a puzzle or leaving it running in the background unless you want to start completely over.-Piece selection: 9 times out of 10, clicking on piece you need will make you pick up a different piece that is floating around near it. It's frustrating to say the least, and the later puzzles (200+ pieces) are almost impossible to finish without the stacking exploit because of this failure to point and click.If you're an achievement hunter, the 26 achievements aren't hard to earn, just very, very tedious. The game also drops 6 cards, but the are almost worthless on the market due to the free keys for this game given away recently.If a save feature was implemented and the piece selection fixed, I would recommend this game; until that time, save your money and your hours for something else. I haven't played anything else in the series so I do not know how they compare.			"

												It's all fun and games at the beginning and you wonder how is it even possible to screw up on a simple game like this. The puzzles are easy, not too many pieces, but then you get to the last ones and the flaws become apparent. You can't save your progress in the middle of a puzzle, you can't join pieces together out of the board, and, the worst of all, you can't get the piece you want because it's burrowed under thousands of others you don't want, and because every piece just decides to float wherever they want, there is no way to dig them out in time.Also, if you manage to stack every single piece, you always get them in the correct order from the top left to bottom right, so nice programming.

												This is a beautifully themed variant of pixel puzzles. It is exactly what it promises to be. The music is relaxing to have in the background whilst attempting to complete the puzzles. The tiered levels do get fairly hard and time consuming( the pieces get smaller and more numerous). My only complaint is not having a save feature to allow you to complete the puzzles in stages. A great game to pass some time if you enjoy jigsaw puzzles.			"

												Oh my word the design choices on this one. Sounds fun and mellow enough, just a classic fit the pieces together puzzle like your grandpa did on the table top. Your grandpa could always look at the box to see the picture, but I still can't seem to figure out how I made the picture pop up that one time. Then there are the absolutely tiny puzzle pieces floating in a pond. Floating all over each other, and generally being a nuisance to click, or find the one piece you want. I've had to click 10 times, randomly getting other nearby pieces, before finally getting the one I want. The pictures themselves are pretty, but several just don't have enough definition between areas of the puzzle. It turns them into a random ""does this fit here?"" mess of trial and error. Then I haven't found a way to save in the middle of a puzzle, you know like grandpa leaving it on the kitchen table til he can get around to it again. If you want to tell me how to save, or look up the puzzle, that's awesome, but it's something the game needs to explain in some clear way itself. Even better would be giving me some static place I can sort the damn puzzle pieces, without just tossing all of them on the puzzle board, where some will obviously randomly click into the right place. That's not how I want the game to work.In short, something seemingly meant to be soothing is for me entirely aggravating.2/5			"

												Nice puzzle game. My 3 year old son that the koi was hilarious, especially when it swims across the screen if you take it out of the water. The graphics were nice. However, there is no saving, auto or manual. So, expect to sit down and either complete it in one go or have it running in the background while you do other things. If you exit before you completed all the puzzles, you'll have to restart in your Achievement quest.I would recommend this game, although I have been told the other Pixel Puzzles are better. I'd try to catch this one on sale since the nonexistant saving gets REALLY frustrating (especially when you want to take a break and play a different game!)			"

												The puzzles themselves are decent, but unfortunately there are a couple of bad design choice compounded by a game-breaking bug that makes the game more frustrating than fun. See, all of your puzzle pieces are floating around in a koi pon moving around. This already makes it hard to grab the pieces you want, or even find them when there are hundreds of pieces. If you want to stop the pieces from moving, the only place to put pieces that aren't properly set in the puzzle is on the puzzle board itself, which can be very cluttering. But when you select any pieces at all, whether to put it in its final place or just on the board in a pile, it's almost impossible to select the right one. This is partially because the pieces are all moving about, but there's actually a bug that almost always prevents you from selecting the piece you want even when you definitely click on it directly. This makes grabbing any piece an exercise in futility unless you literally take every single piece and make a big pile on the board to sort out there. And all of this is made worse by the lack of any mid-puzzle saving feature at all, so you can only do puzzles in one playthrough, which just seems like a bad choice to me. The game would be improved if these problems were fixed, but there's been no move by the developers to try to fix the bug or add a save option. From what I understand the bug actually stems from an issue with the game engine, and later puzzle games of theirs use a newer engine and don't have the same problem, so they should be fine, but it's just not worth picking this one up unless you want to be annoyed by constant misclicks.

												""Pixel Puzzles: Japan"" is what you would expect from a puzzle game, except for some mismatches in the programming neclecting to some extend the variety of reality puzzles and score lines such as time tables as well as Multiplayer competition. To start with statistics, they simply do not exist, though it would be wishful to see at least your best time and perhaps a score line corresponding to weight functions of the puzzle parts.  Another missing is Multiplayer Mode, and of course, one can easily imagine how attractive this gane could become with such an institution installed in accordance to the standards.The reality comparision may not be totally appropriate, but it's noteworthy to recognize that you cannot rotate the puzzle parts, i.e. they are always preset to insert. An additional rotation (the function of the right mouse button is not in use in this game), perhaps combined with an additional difficulty level (there is only one level explicitly given), would surely make this game more interesting.So, then, after explaining the need of some expansion pack to justify the price (at the moment 70% off would do), what is positive about this game? Answer: It's the shaping of the puzzle parts combined with the variety of motifs, which evoke different strategies of solvation. Thereby, strategies can be chosen according to the color (motif) and the shape of the puzzle parts, especially orientated towards the border parts of the puzzle. Together with the number of puzzle parts, these three ingredients, as functions of the motif, determine a certain level of difficulty. For example, a temple of 112 parts with clear shaped lines and strict color changes could be said to be of an easier handling than a picture of a Sakura branch of 250 parts, where you are left alone with the almost one colored Sakura blossoms. Therefore, the need of concentration in solving a puzzle applying some sorts of strategy makes it clear that this game can be of some interest, generally speaking.			"

												In the real world I don’t like puzzles as it's too hard to keep my dog from eating them. If I turn my back for one second he’s on the table chowing down on the pieces!(Or I accidentally lose pieces in some other less entertaining way)Fortunately my dog can’t interfere with a computer game, and that’s part of what makes Pixel Puzzles: Japan so great. The worst thing that happens on the computer is that you grab a fish!On a more serious note, the pictures are beautiful and the puzzles are reasonably entertaining. I really like that the pieces lock into the correct locations preventing you from accidentally moving them and hurting your progress. The one potential drawback is that the pieces are locked into the proper orientation. This means its essentially doing puzzles on easy mode. This doesn't bother me, but puzzle experts may want to look elsewhere for more challenge.Pixel Puzzles: Japan renewed my interest in puzzles. I definitely recommend it.			"
