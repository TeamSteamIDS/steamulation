												This is going to be a short one. I was in a mood to play some pinball and I got this recently, so I said to myself ""Why not?!"". Well, I found out pretty soon why ""not"" indeed. First, download was small and fast, so no waiting and stuff. Then I ran the game and... well.. it's pure, dissapointing bucket of ♥♥♥♥. First thing, it asked me to register my game. And if I choose somehow not to register it, I won't have the full game, it will work only as a demo. But ok, many games activate on third party services and similar these days, right? Wrong! This piece of crap not only asks for a CDKEY, which is normal, it wants me to register it with my full name, address, phone, email and system specs. And those are required fields!So, naturally I thought - ""Well, this might be an older game. I don't follow my pinball 3D games lately so I'm not that informed when and what pinball game is released. It must be some relic from older days of retail CD cases and stuff.""Wrong! Again! This ♥♥♥♥ is from 2012! At least that's what Steam says. More on that later.Ok. Let's just fill it with some nonsense that resembles names, addresses, with correct city, state and email. Just work already. No. Wrong, yet again! It refuses to register on account that I have not filled all the required fields (I did, numerous times). My next move was to just decide ""Eh, ♥♥♥♥ it. I'll play in demo mode... just run already."".Naturally again, first thing when you run a game for the first time - set/check resolution. Ok, where is that 16:9, 1920x1080.. hm. Oh, wait, there is none. Highest resolution setting is 1600x1200...aaand, if there is some way to change that natively and easily, I did not found it. Oh-♥♥♥♥ing-kay.... let's just play in any resolution, whatever. So, first game, new game. Graphics is crap, everything has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ glow and camera is ♥♥♥♥ing insane. Music is even more crap than the graphics, if you can believe it. In short - gameplay is crap.Next thing that bugged me is to re-check release date of this ♥♥♥♥. Who would have guessed - I was wrong again, well - Steam was, partly. Game was added to Steam in 2012 but... this came out in 2008 and for Nintendo Wii. Now it all started to make sense. Well, at least that part about ingame crappiness. That registration/activation part is still unexplainable even if the game is 5 years old.Luckily, my next move after I publish this will be ""Right click on Dream Pinbal 3D, Delete Local Content"". It had some potential I guess, this game that is. But all that is quickly lost in game's inability to just run like most normal games in last 5-10 years. And yes, we could all say that a bunch of AAA titles had game crashing bugs or errors when you ran them but those were bugs. These are not bugs and unexpected errors. These are deliberately, man made errors that ruined this game. Ok, resolution aside, discard that on whatever resolution was ""hip"" five years ago. But the activation part is the most important part of this, because without it, you don't have the whole game, and it doesn't work.Dream Pinball 3D would probably be a pinnacle of gamemaking in 1998. but here and now, no. Instead it's just ♥♥♥♥ that you try not to step in.Do I recommend this? You guessed it right - No, i don't. Fortunately, I got this in a trade so it's not a loss. But If you plan to shell out any... and I mean - ANY! - amount of cash for this - DON'T. Or at least try free demo first.			"

												Some of the tables are good, but there is a lot wrong with this game which makes an overall recommendation impossible.Some technical issues first:- What's with this Registration bullcrap? Yes one can uncheck and skip it. But things like this are awful. All I get for doing it is apparently a global leaderboard (I have serious doubts this actually would work) and most likely a ton of spam.- CD-key shenaniganism. What do you even want? I don't get it. This is totally unnecessary on steam. Actually it's much worse than unnecessary as the the game is buggy and keeps crashing from time to time while playing with some message about the background cd-key checking having failed (why did I activate it when you keep rechecking it all few minutes?). Should be patched out entirely.-Resolution: max res is 1600x1200. Looks terrible in the menus, is less severe when actually playing. I could live with that. I can not live with the fact though, that after you close the game steam and other windows may be resized and you have to fix it all manually. NOT ACCEPTABLE.Now a few words on the actual game:-This game will most likely literally make you sick as the standard camera is fixed on the ball and the screen will constantly move around. This is more of a rollercoaster simulation than a pinball game^^ You can actually change the camera (press C several times) to be fixed on you/the table, that however doesn't even work with these tables as all 5 of them are designed with several flippers in the upper part of the tables and you'll spent most of the time playing on the top of the tables with these flippers rather than the 2 standard flippers at the bottom/the sinks. Handling a table in fixed camera view is very hard.-The tables all work very similar with ball upgrades (don't even know what it does, color changes but physics stay the same, maybe more points?), no kickbacks at all (there don't seem to be major unfair drains though except on the Knights table - but as I just said it: The ball will spent most of the time on the upper parts of the table) and it's very easy to achieve multiballs and extraballs. Top lits always increase the bonus multiplier, bottom lits (which usually would activate kickbacks) here only give points or activate the ballsaver (in case of Aquantic).The tables:Knight Tournament - meh... ball keeps draining very unfairly on this table.Monsters - Decent table, but only really playable with the standard view imho (prepare your stomache).Dino Wars - Good table, might work better than the other tables with the table fixed camera.Spinning Rotors - Actually this could be a good table if the noises wouldn't kill you. There are constant sirens and horns - unbearable. Aquatic - Again unbearable due to sounds. Everything you hit or the ball moves over causes some sea animal squeaking (well if that's your thing... I can not stand it). Interestingly the table is extremely easy as the ballsaver is on nearly permanently and for some reason I don't even know I kept getting extra balls (on normal difficulty).Amber Moon - I actually enjoyed this one. Definitely the best table for me. Maybe though it's just that I've gotten a bit more used to the ball fixed cam by now as that was the last table I tried^^Conclusion: Some good tables. But it's probably really not for you if you get dizzy easily. Also lots of technical nuisances. Recommendation: Don't even think about buying when it is not on -90% sale/coupon/bundled.			"

												Heres the thing, I really enjoy pinball games. I play Pinball FX2 loads on my Xbox360, I have Zen Pinball on my 3DS, I have several pinball titles for the Ps2. I have even played a good amount of real pinball despite being really bad at it.That said I have no love for this title at all. Lets start with the really ugly bit first, forced registration. Sure you can opt not to, but that leaves you heavily limited ingame with no online leaderboards, demo tables and tables that are locked out from play. Its a stupidly pointless step that is just plain annoying.But then we have the actual tables themselves, six tables, all different themes but all having one big thing thats covered across all of them, they are just dull! The tables offer so little in the way of features and modes compared to other pinball games on steam, theres little life, little energy and little 'fun' too. Essentially its my way of saying 'Basic and Boring' and 'I could be doing better things than this right now' which, happens not to be a good thing to think while playing a game.In one quick last comment then: So Average, its boring.

												Do you like pinball a lot?  Like really can't get enough? Desparate for new tables? Well this is maybe 97 cents worth (which is what I paid for it).  2 tips: uncheck the register box so you don't have to give them your name address and life history, but can still unlock the game, and turn off all the fancy graphics options.  With most games when you turn everything to max settings it's a good thing.  Not so with this game. The bloom effect is blinding and the glass reflection makes it impossible to see anything. shut it all off. The main reason I can't recomend this game tho is because it doesn't seem to support widescreen, even tho there is a 16:9 setting in the options.- and the resolutions they give you to choose from seem random and strange. Don't bother, I like pinball as a distraction, but i was bored with this one right quick....			"

												I love pinball. And when I got a 90% off coupon for Dream Pinball 3D, I read the reviews here and I knew what I was getting into. But I took it as a bit of a challenge, to see if I could actually get the game up and running and evaluate it on its own merits, or lack thereof. It wasn't very difficult to get going (who doesn't use a backup email and info for internet purposes these days anyway?, set compability mode for XP, and as an extra step I went ahead and added the .exe to DEP since I run Win 8.1). As long as you don't try to do anything fancy, like alt-tab or upload your scores or load the registration window, or exit, it's sort of stable. I didn't get any crashes during the game itself anyway.The screen ratio is stretched in widescreen, and even though 16:9 is an option those resolutions can't be set. Nothing, it seems, can be done about that. I'd also recommend cranking down the effects since all the bloom, reflection, glass, lighting, etc. seems to do is make it really hard to see your ball whizzing around the distorted table. Also, there is no controller support, and the default key settings were oddly configured but could be changed.There are 6 tables, they're nothing special really, but they're not the worst I've played. The play isn't anything novel for pinball, but it's got all the combos, multiball, missions, extra balls, etc. you expect from a decent table. The physics aren't really comparable to Pinball Arcade and the theming and missions aren't even in the same league as Pinball FX2, two outstanding pinball games which can be downloaded on Steam free with a single free table each. I did find it a bit easier to keep my ball alive on the Dream Pinball 3D tables than I generally do in the other pinball games, which was nice for a change of pace as a relatively novice player.In all, I feel like I personally got my 70 cents' worth just to satisfy my own curiousity, but I can't really recommend the game unless you're a die-hard pinball fanatic and you're stuck with a 10 year-old computer you can't run anything better on. I'm probably going to throw this on an old laptop that I use for ancient DOS games since I think it will run fine with all the useless bells and whistles turned off and the screen ratio won't be an issue.

												I'll be honest with ya. I only got this because I got a 90% off coupon from making a badge and thought $1 for pinball is a good deal. Sadly, it still felt like a ripoff.First thing that happens when you launch this is you have to register the game and include stuff like your full name, email, phone#, etc. If you don't do this, you won't be getting the full game you paid for. After taking a few minutes to fill in info I was sure wasn't gonna be used for anything [Update: They wanted all that stuff to send me newsletters for their other stuff. Yeah, no thanks.], I was ready to play this...only to have the controller not respond to the game. At first I thought you had to change the input from keyboard to controller. Nope. Game doesn't support controllers. I wouldn't make a big deal about this if this was originally released in say, 2001. This game came out in 2008. Inexcusable.Now for the gameplay. The game comes with 6 tables of different themes. Now 6 good tables would be worth the $10 price. These 6 didn't feel like they were worth the $1 I payed. Gameplay just felt so dull and slow that I didn't even bother to play the tables seriously. The bad music and camera angles didn't exactly help either. This was just a mess all around. After 1 playing of it, this was uninstalled and never played again.If you want to spend $10 on pinball, get either Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX and spend it on the packs. Sure you might get less tables, but they'll actually be worth it.			"

												What a train wreck.  Old or not, this could never have been good.  Zen and The Pinball Arcade are so much better it's not funny at all.  I'd rather pay $5 a game at a redneck KKK bar to play a Medieval Madness table with broken trolls, 3 legs, and no flippers while wearing a ""Gay Obama supporters for the right to marry your Palestinian pets"" shirt than play this mess again.  All while singing Lady Gaga at the top of my lungs.			"

												Highly NOT recommend.So much is just not right with the game. First off, there are several pinball 'games', but they seem so much like the same game, with altered 'themes', but the performance is so similar. Example, they all have bonus multipliers 2,4,6,8,10. None of them have a 'skill shot' start to speak of, and that all seem to have the same voice narrating.The biggest complaint I have about the game is the camera views. It comes with a seisure warning, for a reason. The logic behind 'changing your chosen camera angle' gets more than frustrating. Multiball has no sense of capturing a ball. A target gets hit & it 'locks' a multiball, but the ball continues from that spot, so no lock takes place (In every version of the game).So, say you hit multiball & one of the several balls goes into an area that the AI thinks you should be watching in some super-nifty view, then the camera angle you chose goes away & if another ball is headed toward your main flippers, you'd better be good at using the Force, because it won't be on your screen. Then, say for one of the many times during the game you want to toggle back to your prefered view ... well there seems to be no rhyme or reason to what order they cycle through. And while you can choose your hot key for camera view, it won't go straight to your chosen view, it cycles in some awful order.I could go on about how there are odd things like flames on all 5 pinball tables (even the underwater version). But I'll stop here, and suggest you move on down the street to another game. I bought mine 90% off with a Steam 'reward' for completing a trade card set, but it was one of the most hideous gaming experiences of my life. If I was paid $15.00 to try it again for the same time I have used it for $1.00 . . . I'd turn down the cash.			"

												You know a game is bad when you regret winning it for free.Seriously, this is horrendous. A lengthy 3rd-party DRM process is involved just to play the game, including entering your steam key for a second time, as well as filling out a legthy registration form that asks you a slew of personal information such as your age, address, and phone number. Why would a pinball game need that anyway? I have no idea.The best part? After filling out this invasive registration, it doesn't work. I click ""register"" and I get an error message that says ""All Marked Boxes Must Be Filled In"". They are. I filled in every single box and cannot get this game to register for the life of me. I'm unsure if it's just broken, or if this 3rd party company is long gone, thus leaving the software with no server to cross-reference your information and email you the activation code.So I said screw it, skipped activation, and the game went into demo mode. It only allows you to play one map in this mode, but that was enough for me to realize what a pile of garbage this game is anyway. Only a few set resolutions, horrible camera control, terrible graphics/music. The control map scheme is one of the most baffling I've ever enountered, and this is a simplistic pinball game. There's absolutely nothing enjoyable about this title. I've played Early Access Alpha games that functioned better.0/10 not even worth trying for $0.			"

												Ugh, let me start of by saying this game is bad, really bad. Right off the bat before you even open the game they not only want you to enter a CD key, but they also want your home address, phone number, email address, full name, etc etc. Already very off put by the game and not willing to give them any info (even fake info), I start up the game and find out it is only the demo version unless I give them the info. I then enter the option menus and see some very strange resolutions and a few other options you would want to turn off in order to be able to even see the table, without being blinded by the pinball machine's glass.So I start up the game and it seemed decent enough. Graphics were fine, music and sound effects were alright and it seemed like an average pinball game. Until you actually put the pinball in action, then the camera freaks out and feels like someone put the game camera on a ceiling fan. Played for awhile trying to get used to the camera and the game crashed. :/You may be able to fix it from the options menu with its unhelpfully named ""Camera 1"""" Camera 2""  ""Camera 3"" etc. You have to start up the game to actually see what the difference is. From the few I tried they seemed exactly the same and I am not willing to go through all that hassle to play the demo of a game I bought. It is just too much of a pain to play this game while we have plenty of other fantastic pinball options on Steam. Overall this is more of a rant than a review since I have only tried it for 20 minutes, but I can wholeheartedly advise against buying this game.			"

												Dream Pinball 3D is a pretty standard pinball game with several different tables. Sadly, this game is far inferior to Pinball FX2, which is far better and offers tables with deeper gameplay at a lower price.Let's start with the camera. This game actually made me motion sick. Games never have that impact on me. Heck, I regularly play my 3DS with the 3D turned on, and I've played a lot of games that should really cause nausea without any problems, but this game got to me. That's how bad the camera is. You can choose to zoom out and have the camera be fixed, but then you can't see any of the details on the board, or you can stick with the close-up that moves at the same speed as the ball, so you still can't really see much, and twists and turns to completely disorient you.Next, the controls. One thing I love about other pinball games is that you can use an Xbox controller and use the triggers to control the pinball flippers. This game supports controllers, but only barely, and it doesn't accept analog buttons like the triggers. Also, you can't use the controller in the menus; you must use keyboard and mouse. I could configure JoyToKey, and I would, but I don't plan to start this game up again.The tables aren't bad in this game, they're just unremarkable.Also, when I tried to turn this game off, it crashed so hard I had to reboot my computer (it refused to let me access the Task Manager to kill it). Thanks, Dream Pinball 3D.From the whole presentation of this game, you'd swear it was made in 2000. Maybe this game would've been fine at the time, but we have better games to choose from now. At $7, this game is a complete joke. I think I picked this game up on sale for $0.70, and while I don't think this game was worth what I paid, I can't be too mad at having wasted less than a dollar. As I mentioned before, Pinball FX2 is the far superior game, and I'd recommend buying a few new tables for that game instead of playing Dream Pinball 3D at all.			"

												There are a lot of free browser Pinball games and then there are the better looking, paid versions like 'Dream Pinball 3D'.I don't think I should explain the game mechanics. The game plays pretty well and there are 6 decks to choose from, which all look nice to me. Many of the other reviewers had trouble playing the game. Personally, I did not encounter any crashes whatsoever. You do have to insert your serial in a third party DRM application, which is annoying if you uninstall/install the game a lot. Dream Pinball 3D is not that bad but with only 6 decks, it simply doesn't offer that much to justify the price tag (atm 70 cents but normal price = 7 Euro).			"

The table design also makes it quite clear that the developers have little to no experience with pinball in general. There are better pinball games from the 80s.Dream Pinball 3D is mediocre.			"

Table designs are blegh and obscure, ball physics are odd, to the point of ludicrousness.Not worth a single cent.. played it 10 minutes or something, and I want that time back!			"

												Let me start off by saying that I did not aquire this game for free. I paid for it and am glad that I did. There are issues with it though, so let me start with those. When attempting to launch this game it generally won't unless you click Compatibilty Mode. That does the trick for me, but others have complained that it didn't do any good when they tried it, so fair warning. I'm using Windows 7.  There are several resolution settings, although there are a few that I've never run across before.The second issue has to do with registration of the game. The form asks for alot of personal information, but once filled out it works for me, but a few have complained that once filled in the program refuses to run until all blocks are 'filled in'. I didn't have this issue.  I've noticed that the game has a tendency to crash if I inadvertently hit the Space Bar when the action gets frantic. Normally the Space Bar is used for the Plunger. If I can avoid that mistake all is well, although it has happened a few times, usually when I have an enormous score built up.There are six tables, each with a different theme, and various difficulty settings. Novice. Normal. Hard. Expert. I wish the tables were brighter, but that may just be my personal prefrence. The tables are good, but aren't up to the standards set by Zen studios with it's Pinball FX2 game. Plus Zen offers 57 tables with more features and are about to release more. Pinball FX2 sells it's tables as DLCs with one free table. Dream Pinball 3D has no DLC stuff to buy. Many complained (not me) when a bug in the game forced Zen to reset the Leaderboards (not the Local scores though), but Dream Pinball 3D doesn't even have a Leaderboard. Just local scores. You can upload your scores with Dream Pinball 3D, but I have no idea where they go when you do so. This function fails to work alot of the time anyway.This game is alot of fun though, especially if you like old-school pinball. The game itself is about 8 years old so it's starting to show it's age. The ball physics are good and there are actual goals to achieve, unlike Fantastic Pinball Thrills which has neither. The controls take getting use to. The Left Flippers are controlled by the Left Shift key, and the Right Flippers are controlled by the Enter key. Gameplay is solid.The High Score screen has scores already entered as default scores to aim for. If you don't at least reach the lowest high score then the game will momentarily display your score beneath the high scores. As you achieve higher and higher high scores the target scores go up. So it becomes more and more difficult to reach the minimum, assuming of course that you never improve.  Learning the goals of each table and how to achieve them is key.  Some tables, like Amber Moon for example, have more than one way to increase the multiplier.I like it. Currently 38 friends of mine own this game and 4 want it. I believe I have logged more play time than any of them. This may have to do with the difficulty some have had getting this game to work. Use Compatibility Mode. If you still have issues then try different resolution settings. The game was developed by A.S.K. Homework Game Development, who also developed Zaccaria Pinball for Android devices. This game has also been released for the DS and wii.			"

												It's an okay game, if you liked the old windows version of pinball this is a step up from that. On the other hand it doesn't support 16:10 or apparently anything above 1600x1200, the resolution settings are pretty lame.  1920x1200? Nope, it won't do it.  Also, what appears to be the required registration and all that stuff should make the typical steam user run.  Run in fear.  I didn't spend much on it, my loss is your gain.

Awful. I was expecting a nice pinball game to pass the time, but this game is just downright terrible. The support is beyond bad, sloppy physics, dreadful sound, lame artwork, dull gameplay, and a doubtlessly horrendous options system. It lacks widescreen support, and it has registration issues which limits your experience. I enjoyed pinball as a kid despite being crap at it, and was hoping to get some enjoyment out of this, but it's literally impossible to. Go with other titles such as Pinball FX2 or Pinball Arcade.

To make matters worse if you choose not to give them your information then they will not let you use the full game EVEN THO YOU PAID FOR IT! Company give me a bad sketchy vibe and I think steam should do a background check on this company.Seeing as steam forced me to play the game for 5 mins before I can tell everyone how much I hate it I played it for a little while and it got even worse. The graphics where Medicore to poor. Resolution (at least the default settings) was very poor and grainy. The games physics seemed really off too, the ball seems to bounce in odd ways from time to time. The default controlls are weird in my first game alone the machine sent 5 balls straight from the launcher to the zone between the flippers (in otherwords forced me to loose balls)Overall recap.Graphics: 5Sound: 7Controlls: 5Overall playability: 4I would not force this on my worst enemy.........

												First things first: I haven't had all the technical problems many of the negative reviews for this game have had. In fact, the game started up immediately, and other than some grumbling over the lack of resolution options I was in like Flynn. That said....This isn't the worst pinball game I've ever played. It surpasses the likes of many video pinball tables in fact, such as Pinball on the Atari 2600, or the Colecovision, or the pinball games made with those black-only LCD screens.On PC though? There are better, cheaper options, and when your biggest product tie-in is with Two Worlds, a series that A) the developers own the rights to and B) is known for being of questionable quality on its own, you know you have some problems right out of the gates.Let's start with the basics, shall we? Other than the resolution issue visual presentation of the tables is okay. The menus are sparse at best, but they are easy to navigate and clear and concise in the function of all the options available. Tables have particle effects at times, and some mip mapping of textures on certain surfaces to keep things dynamic and interesting, though if you play with table glass enabled the reflections on said glass do get in the way of a lot of the table's detail. I still recommend keeping the glass on, however, because it also helps to cover up some of the bigger flaws the tables have in their artistic design, mostly centered around sub-par artwork in general. Several of the tables -- like Monsters and the aquatic-themed table -- bear more of a resemblance to discount store product packaging than they do to pinball tables, with a combination of poorly drawn characters and questionable photoshop work providing the bulk of their visual design.That said, the visuals have little to do with the way the tables themselves play, which is, again, okay. Ball physics are ho-hum, with a feel closer to the old 3D Ultra Pinball games than the likes of Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX, but are perfectly playable and easily predictable, even familiar to those who grew up with older PC and console video pinball titles more than real-world tables. Likewise, the table designs are acceptable. There is little in the way of creative features or multiple playable levels to the tables, meaning tables often feel cramped and small. Many of the tables feature extra flippers placed in almost arbitrary locations, doing little to supplement the table's flow or play at all, with Spinning Rotors featuring a set of tiered flippers in the middle of the table that are, at best, completely useless, and at worst get in the way of the ball's path through obstacles. When the tables work, though, they work relatively well, with a fair amount of ramps and habitrails to keep them visually interesting. Goals on the tables seem sparse if not nonexistent, but for tables to just waste a few minutes with they could be worse. If there is one glaring gameplay shortcoming it's the lack of controller support, since I very much prefer to use a joypad when playing pinball games, but the controls the game uses by default are remappable on the keyboard and by default are quite similar to those featured in many other PC pinball titles.By far the game's biggest disappointment is in the audio department. While table sounds are okay, if a bit teensy in their clickiness and identical from table to table, the music featured on the tables ranges from forgettable to completely absent. Announcers have the same basic lines for the most part, with generic phrases often used when just a little more flavor could have gone a long way to improve the presentation of each table's theme. As a result the overall audio experience taken from each table is basically devoid of any kind of character and severely hurts the feel of the game.In the end, though, is Dream Pinball 3D worth the price?The answer is a resounding ""no."" At least, not full price. I picked the game up at a severe discount (67 cents I believe) and feel in no way cheated or disappointed in the product I received for that price. If the game were even only marginally cheaper -- 4.99, say -- I would feel that I could provide a recommendation just because the tables are, in fact, playable and it's obvious there was some effort put in to make the game worthwhile. At the game's default price of 6.99, however, you're better off just saving up another couple of bucks and investing in a starter set of tables from the likes of Pinball FX 2, or picking up one of the Pinball Arcade sets when they go on sale (as they frequently do.) At best, Dream Pinball 3D is a second or even third-tier pinball title, worth picking up at discount and for variety, but with little other reason to recommend it.			"

												There are ten steps to this:1. Get your steam key. Put that in, download and install.2. Launch the game and get another key. You have to type this in manually because each group of 4 letters is in a separate entry field and pasting from the clipboard only fills in one field at a time.3. Get another key. I think this one's for saving high scores or something.4. Activate the game.5. Go into the options and realise the max resolution is 1280x1024 and there is no controller support.6. Exit the options screen and choose ""play"".7. Wait for a minute to see if anything is happening.8. Ctrl-Shift-Esc when you realise there is no other way to exit this frozen screen.9. Right click on game in steam. Select ""delete local content"".10. Play a different game.			"

												Everyone else has stated how annoying the forced registration is, but I had even worse issue with this game:I got motion sickness playing it due to the fact that the default camera follows the ball from a very close distance. There's one fixed camera angle, but the view is like from the 90s free pinball games, which is directly from the top. That just doesn't allow you to judge the distances at all.All in all, the game's only useful as +1 to collection stats, otherwise worse than waste of time. Try Pinball Arcade and/or Pinball FX2 to get your fix of virtual pinball on Steam.			"

												DON'T BUY THIS GAME. just got it, looking forward to a bit of pinball. I didn't bother checking the reviews, why would a game be on steam if it wasn't working or worth buying? I was wrong. This game asks you to register when you open it, after many attmepts I can't register as ""you must fill in all boxes"" which I have done. This leaves me stuck with a free demo of the game that I payed for all I can do is play one map, which also doesn't work. When the game loads in there is no indication of what to do or press. All I could do whilst the camera continued to pan at the same time as the ball was pinging around was change the camera angle to an even worse one, the people who made this game should be treated as theives or killed to be honest i don't care which but they need to be punished for this utterly useless peice of ♥♥♥♥.

												I'd be sincere, I bought this game because it was on sale, and I love pinball simulation games... Also, for less than 2 € I thought was a good deal having 6 tables...Well, actually the tables are pretty below average and kinda dull... Not much energy on them, graphics are ok but sound is pure boredom. Another thing I disliked is the forced registration (which is TOTALLY BAD especially considering we are already registered on Steam) and the lack of support for controllers. Ok, I used to play games like Pinball Fantasies on AMIGA using the 2 shift/alt buttons on keyboard, but actually we are in the year 2014 and they should have support for controllers.Also, why there's no support for new gen resolutions? I'd say that playing the older Pinball simulation series from 21st Century Entertainment of the 90s is more fun than those tables. Otherwise if you like upfront Pinball simulators try Pinball FX2 or Pinball Arcade. Their DLCs are more worth.			"

												This game is just awful and there are things that show it.1)  Everytime I hit the ball it goes in the same place as the last time I did.  If I can hit the same spot with every shot, and i'm not trying to be precise, then it's just the developers being lazy and not actually having any physics, just set paths for the ball. 2) There is no difference in how far the spring is pulled back to push the ball, it just went in the same path.  (Going off of the set paths idea from before)3) The game is to expensive for what it is, I bought it with a coupon making the game cost 70 cents, and that is still overpriced for the lack of fun and lack of replayability that it brings.

												=--------REVIEW SYNOPSIS-------------=This by far is the stupidest piece of crap I have had the misfortune of playing. You start by launching the game, only for it to pin you against a wall, strip you naked, put a gun in your mouth, and finally demand you divulge your entire life history for its sick, twisted schemes; by which I mean your name, address, phone number, and exaggeratively your Social Security information, all your credit cards, the names of your friends and family and their addresses, their place of work, their daily routines (including yours), as well as your soul... and your email. If this isn't bad enough... it will proceed to do this same song-and-dance every single time you go to launch the game, as if your registration code issued to you didn't work; much like a fake passport. The game has Maplestory-esque optimization (can't be ran in 1080p, let alone 720p).. there are basically no controls unless you want to turn your entire hand inside-out, and even then this was designed by an absolute madman. This game in its entirety feels as though it's one of those throw-away Walmart PC games you find for around $10 that installs a whole heap of malware onto your computer that doesn't even have an internet connection! Looks good on the store page, but don't let this fool you... there is no game to be had here; only misery. Save yourself $5. Go buy anything but this. Bad Rats has more playability than this pile of garbage.=--------PROGRESSIVE POINTS----------=*None to be had=--------CONTRARY POINTS-------------=*Demands your info on every launch*Terrible graphics*No controls*Repetitive music*Resolutions from the 70s*Go play Space Cadet Pinball instead, it's far superior=--------PERSONAL GAME RESULTS-------=I give this game a 0/10I give this game a [THROW IT IN A DITCH]			"

												I bought through a bundle ages ago, just now getting around to playing it.I'm by no means a hardcore pinball player, but I have enjoyed Pinball on everything from the Atari 2600 to the NES, SNES, Win95 (remember the one that come with PLUS?), and possibly a few other platforms over the years.That said....This game isn't too bad. I enjoyed it. The tables feel a little minimal, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The physics seems about right, and the game claims that each ball has its own properties that will affect the physics, so each table will play differently, but I didn't notice any difference.Overall, a nice little casual game to kill some time with.

												I thought this game was pretty cool. Yeah it doesn't do 1080p, and that is noticable if your eyes are sharp (or you sit close). I found the tables to be much better than a lot of these reviewers. I bought Star Wars Pinball on PS3 and I was sorely dissapointed with it. That game had 3 tables and two of them did physically impossible things, which is unauthentic and distracting. I understand if I want classic styled pinball I should go to an arcade and slap some pinball but this is closer than most say. It's solid. I DO feel the difference with the different desnities of balls. The Ivory ball for example, feels lighter than the rest and loses its momentum easily with direct bounces. All the tables are realistic. No crazy things throwng the ball off the table, and no really ever impossible goals. I hate it when it takes half an hour to get the quest you want going and you can't hit your goal, M$ pinball, or the table is unlosable, M$ Pinball again. Yeah, got it on SBM for $1.35, and it's not as bad as they say.			"

												First of all ignore the trash talk on the steam forums about this games physics. It is not as well modelled as Pinball FX2 but it's 'good enough'. Ball type also changes from time to time from metal to wood/marble/stone etc.. This seems to anger the purists a lot even though it's just a gimmick to change the ball behaviour a bit. This game used to be the king of the hill in the past and this can be seen in the aged but still pretty good looking graphics of this game. It also runs well in 1920x1080.5 tables with varying themes and difficulties are included in this game. Now the big question: Should i buy it if i already have Pinball FX 2? Answer is YES. This game is unique that it's loose ball model and spacious tables make it possible to play long pinball marathons and rack up hundreds of millions of points. Extra balls and multiballs are somewhat easily available. And did i already say it's possible to bump the ball back to the table from the drain old school pinball dreams -style? That is pure Awesomeness and adds a nice additional skill element to the game.			"

Even if the player was given a sense of the weight of the ball and the flippers reacted like they should, you'd still have some pretty generic tables.With more ambition in the table design, Dream Pinball 3D has the potential to be great.

												I'm going to start this off by saying that I have not tried any rival pinball games on steam. And probably never will due to knowing how much a free to play aspect really costs when you start paying for it.For starters, DO NOT REGISTER. There are a lot of places that give so much more in the world that ask to know a lot less. Do yourself a favor and never register. Yeah, nobody will see your leaderboard. take a screenshot and post it. A lot less intrusive.As for the game itself, everything really flops except for the pinball laughably enough... The main screens before you pick a stage are skewed off screen and are hard or impossible to read. The resolutions are sort of hopeless, and it's just annoying to bother with. But the main tables they're pretty okay to play and experience. Though in reality they really do not vary much in a futuristic sense, no events that require you to look on screen or even read anything, no spin traps or anything that really screams aim for this as best as you can. Though, it still manages to look fun and can surely kill a few hours without being intrusive or ending your session as soon as you're in the zone. Unfortunately the slide back mechanic is ruthless, and the ball will roll down a ramp at high speeds if they really dont want you up there. a basic slide door would have been easier to deal with than a painful rollback aimed exclusively between the two flips. lots of dying will happen. And in my case, the screen does lock up at random times, though usually when I can save the ball. But I don't have the best laptop, so I can forgive that.That being said, for 70 cents, you don't really lose anything by trying it, as one trip to an arcade will cost you more, or even a visit to a local store with one of these in it will cost you more. and it's for one use. so honestly it's still worth a look see at this price, however, I do feel that at full price they should at least bother to fix the pre pinball interface, fix resolutions, and actually add leaderboards for steam and not just for whatever they need my extended identification for.

												I actually quite enjoyed playing this game, although to be fair, that was before I played The Pinball Arcade. I'm wary of paying good money for pinball games, because they are often pretty bad, but I paid very little for this and it's okay. There's none of the frustration I've experienced elsewhere, and the ball save feature is very forgiving. One thing I would say is that the graphics resolution is only 1600 x 1200 at most. To be fair, the game seems to be from around 2002, judging by the copyright date on the website.			"

												How many games do you know that bring you back time and time again just to relive the story? Be among the characters you grew with, shared hardship and triumph with? I can already guess the list is quite low as these titles are so few and far between. But I come bearing good news. There is at least one more masterpiece to add to your minimal roster, and that game is Dream Pinball 3D. Forget the gameplay, forget the graphics, forget it all. What this gem delivers on first and foremost is plot. Just minutes in, you are drawn into a world brimming with character and life. As you wind through this labyrinth of charm bumper to bumper, you begin to ponder some of life's most universal questions as you face the hardships and turmoils laid before you. Dream Pinball 3D, with its fantastic delivery and seamless plot transitions, brings an unforgettable experience and worldly themes straight to your shift keys. 5/5 quarters			"

												While Dream Pinball 3D may not have the sheer number of tables as other titles like Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2, this is nonetheless a fun game. Unlike Pinball FX2, Dream Pinball 3D tends to be more sim-style in its approach to pinball, which can be refreshing if you happen to tire of Pinball FX2. I do also like the game's price point, which is its advantage over Pinball Arcade. Now, if you can get this game when Steam is having one of its quarterly sales, so much the better.			"

If you have any other games, uninstall them now and buy copies of this game and buy copies for everyone you know, and everyone you don't know, just so they can have the chance to experience the life-changing sensation of Dream Pinball 3D. I am ytuly down in the dumps because i couldn't have put in all of my personal information as others have so that the creators of the game could come to my home and play their masterpiece with me. I am also truly grateful that Burfzilla the Spook introduced me to this stiffy-inducing game, and i applaud him for his efforts in spreading this game to my computer. I rate this game 666 out of 2 pinballocks. Would buy over 9000 more times just to see that glorious invalid registration code message.			"

												After picking this up in a bundle, i was wary at first. The registration to post high scores etc. However, it's not hard to look for houses for sale and put those in :DA fun game, very relaxing and can get intense if you play for too long. Highly suggest picking this up.			"

												demands to have your addres email and phone number in order to play the full game. If you do not, it will limit the levels avaliable and will kick you to the main menu after an unknown amount of time.From what little i managed to play, the game is ok, but could do with some button prompts to prevent the need for mashing my keyboard.The settings menu is terrible. Altering the audio sliders requires activating the spesific slide by hovering over the word and then moving the mouse left and right. Moving to the next will alter the currently active.			"

												I'm deleting some games to make room but forgot to do this for the first couple. Maybe i'm just bored. The reviews for this are bad last i checked but i thought it was decent. I'm no pinball physics expert but it seemed to do just as well as any other pinball i've played. Has online leaderboards but you need to make an extra account or something. Cant remember haven't played in a while or much. But if i'm in the mood for some pinball this does the job nicely. And you get a full package. No buying bits and peices. Tables and what not. Did i spell peices wrong? The ei or ie always gets me.			"

(However easily changed at start of table)This and some other small things make me unable to recommend this to a pinball enthusiast.Sum:Try it if you want, don’t have the exceptions I had.//vitloken			"

												I can't stop laughing.While the game started up fine and runs fine on Mac, the designer seems to be from a world where pinball games all have a MINIMUM of 5 flippers!Also, the table designs are crazy. Like someone was given a verbal description of what pinball tables are like and then went from there.Overall, sort of worth the 5 bucks for the amusement factor alone after playing such excellent games as The Pinball Arcade or Pinball FX2.

												I'm a pinball nut and so I jumped at this, but I should have read the reviews, as this is more like abandonware. Won't run in 16:9 resolution on Win8.1 even though the option is there. Won't even let me switch resolutions to any of the options visible. Went to the support web site and found unanswered questions on the same topic that are years old. Simply put, unplayable unsupported garbage. Steam shouldn't be carrying this given its poor ratings. Don't bother.			"

												I recommend this game only if you can find an extra .69 cents in the couch. I have quite a few pinball games and this one has to be the worst I've played since win95. The physics are horrible, the graphics are poor, and the sound track has much to be desired. The tables, for the most part, are uninteresting to play. If you really half to have every pinball game ever made buy it, otherwise save your money and buy a good game such as pinball arcade (copies of real life machines) or pinball fx2 (fantasy tables but still very well done).I'd like to add that I really wish I had read the other reviews before purchasing, It would have saved me the trouble of buying this crappy game and halving to write this review.

												Just... just don't even buy this. Don't even consider buying this game. You can't even start it up, and it asks you for your age, address, phone number, fax, full name, and a bunch of other unessisary crap just to play a PINBALL game. Oh gee, I thought for sure this was COD, asking for all my info so you can put me in a certain squad and train me up from a young man to a strong soldier.... NO! THIS IS A DAMN PINBALL GAME! Very disappointed. -0/0 Go download Pinball Arcade instead. It actually works and it's free too.			"

												Dream Pinball 3D Review - Raymond KTDream Pinball 3D fails at reproducing realistic physics, rendering it pretty much useless. Even if the player was given a sense of the weight of the ball and the flippers reacted like they should, you'd still have some pretty generic tables. The table collection in Dream Pinball consists of a bunch of clichés and one ambiguous fantasy game. You've got your medieval table, your monster table, your dinosaur table… They're well thought out with the usual secrets, combos, and special modes, but they aren't inspired. The one machine that isn't easily described is Amber Moon, which appears to be a mishmash of sword and sorcery themes. A sexy witch/vampire lady adorns the table's artwork, but the standout sound effect is a bird call that doesn't sound mysterious or supernatural at all. Weird. Overall, the sound in Dream Pinball is pretty well done. Each table has its own soundtrack, appropriate sound effects, and a voice over giving you commentary.The first thing any pinball wizard will notice about this effort is the flippers are terrible. They aren't governed by physics at all. There are simply two flipper modes: up and down. Flipping them doesn't result in any movement; they are transported from a resting position to an upright position. This denies the player the ability to finesse their shots with varying degrees of strength.Also disappointing are the ball physics. The orbs don't feel like they have any weight to them. Each table has a ""ballchange"" feature that switches the material of your ball from steel to things like marble or walnut. The manual claims this will alter the weight and handling of your orbs, but in practice they don't feel any different. Sometimes it doesn't even feel like the ball is making contact with the flippers. "
